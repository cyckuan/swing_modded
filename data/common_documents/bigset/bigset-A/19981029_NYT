FTOREK EXPRESSES NO BITTERNESS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ It took nearly a decade, but Robbie
Ftorek finally coached a game against his former team.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Wayne Gretzky was in his first year with the Los
Angeles Kings and Ftorek was in his last year as their coach.
Despite a 42-31-7 record and a first-round playoff victory that
year, the Kings fired Ftorek when the season was over amid rumors
Gretzky might have had a hand in the decision.
</P>
<P>
   If Ftorek holds any bitterness, he's keeping it to himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wasn't the coach for that team,'' said Ftorek, now the
coach of the New Jersey Devils, who played host to the Kings on
Wednesday night. ``I went in to coach a young team. All of a
sudden, it became an older team.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the Kings' former owner and former general manager,
Ftorek said, ``Bruce (McNall), Rogie (Vachon) and the scouts didn't
feel I was the right person for the job. I have to respect that
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Gretzky's possible involvement, Ftorek said, ``I
really don't think so. It doesn't really matter. If Bruce and Rogie
asked Wayne for his opinion, that's their prerogative. I mean that
sincerely. It wouldn't bother me.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Legacy of laundry: Two weeks ago today, goalie Manny Legace
left with the Long Beach Ice Dogs for what he thought would be a
nine-day trip. But he was recalled by the Kings during the trip,
and nine days suddenly became two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his clothing situation, Legace said, ``I ran out
five days ago. I try to wash my underwear in the sink. I've got two
golf shirts and only one dress shirt. The dress shirt has got to
have a vaccination when we get back home. It's pretty raunchy. It's
got to have some kind of disease growing on it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been worth it, though. Legace's save percentage (.962)
leads NHL goalies.
</P>
<P>
   __ Not bitter: Kings defenseman Doug Bodger's stay with the
Devils was short and not especially sweet. Traded to New Jersey by
San Jose at midseason a year ago, Bodger asked Devils general
manager Lou Lamoriello if he could wait a couple of days before
reporting so he could spend some time with his wife, Tracey, and
their two young children.
</P>
<P>
   The request was denied.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `If I give you time, I'll have to give it to the
other players,''' Bodger recalled. ``I said, `Try to be a little
understanding,' and he said he didn't see what the problem was.
They don't trade GMs, so I guess he didn't see a problem with it.''
</P>
<P>
   As the season progressed, Bodger's playing time was sporadic
with the defense-deep Devils. He welcomed the trade to the Kings
during the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did me a favor by trading me here,'' said Bodger, 32.
``I'm getting two times as much ice time here as I did there. The
coaching staff is showing more confidence in me. I don't have any
regrets at all.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Loose pucks: General Manager Dave Taylor on coach Larry
Robinson, who has yet to sign off on a proposed contract extension:
``He said he's just worried about getting the team going. We'd like
to sign him and he'd like to get it done. There's no concern on our
part.''... The Kings start a four-game home stand Friday night
against Tampa Bay.... The Kings were 2-4-3 after nine games a year
ago.

GLENN, HOWE AMONG ELDERS WITH RIGHT STUFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last time someone so ``experienced'' performed such a
physically demanding task after such a long layoff might have been
a year ago. That's when hockey legend Gordie Howe skated a shift
for the minor-league Detroit Vipers.
</P>
<P>
   Howe hadn't played in a professional game since 1980 when he was
a mere lad of 52. At 69, he laced 'em up again. His performance was
not unimpressive: He nearly scored a goal off a deflection and even
``put the lumber'' to a younger (what else?) opponent who crossed
his path.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the Detroit Red Wings Hall of Famer had a thought or
two about another septuagenarian trying to make history today:
astronaut John Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got more guts than I do,'' Howe said yesterday by phone
from Michigan. Laughing, Howe added, ``He's to an age where a
ladder looks pretty high.''
</P>
<P>
   When the 77-year-old Glenn blasts into space today, 36 years
after he first went into orbit, it will mark one of the biggest
comebacks ever _ in human achievement generally, and, specifically,
in physical accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the demands on an astronaut's body compare to those on a
professional athlete's is debatable, as is the issue of who is and
who is not an athlete. But in his training and on his mission,
Glenn is facing challenges to his stamina and strength that few
former athletes tackle in retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Sports has had its share of players, like Howe, known for both
their brilliant performances and for their longevity. Among them:
driver Mario Andretti, who won almost every major auto race in a
career that ran from the late 1950s to the mid-1990s; George
Blanda, a pro quarterback and kicker at 48; Jack Nicklaus, a
challenger at the Masters well into in his 50s; and Nolan Ryan, a
strikeout king in his 40s.
</P>
<P>
   How they'll fare in physical pursuits at Glenn's age won't be
known for a while, but they'll all have quite a standard to match.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: Glenn will be weighted down by some 80 pounds of gear,
a burden he must be able to run some distance with if there is a
need to evacuate the spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   As for astronaut training sessions, they might not have been an
NFL training camp, but there were taxing moments.
</P>
<P>
   There was, for example, the demanding bit of training in which
Glenn had to undergo two 8.5-minute-long spins in a centrifuge at
three times the force of gravity.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's like having a 230-pound gorilla on your chest,'' is how
those who know describe the experience.
</P>
<P>
   That might not sound like much to Steve DeBerg. The 44-year-old
quarterback, who made his NFL return as a starter Sunday with the
Atlanta Falcons, had 330-pound linemen on his chest all day long.
Nonetheless, a couple of spins in the centrifuge isn't easy on a
40-year-old, let alone a longtime office worker pushing 80.
</P>
<P>
   NASA, of course, isn't looking for the standard version of an
athlete _ someone who can run faster, jump higher, or do special
things with a ball in hand. Instead, officials say, they need
brainy types who can withstand the added physical rigors of space.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no specific physical fitness standards for an
astronaut,'' said Doug Peterson, astronaut liaison for NASA. ``They
need to be in good physical condition, and most of them are out
there jogging and working out, but there isn't a hard and fast
requirement.''
</P>
<P>
   Astronauts do have their vision, hearing and blood pressure
checked, much like commercial pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his physical abilities recently, Glenn said, ``After
the training here . . . I don't think there's much doubt about my
being able to keep up.'' He did, however, refuse a reporter's
request to do a push-up during a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's athleticism, at least early in his military career,
should not be underestimated, however. As a Marine pilot, he
endured training and conditioning thresholds that most NFL, NBA,
NHL and major-league baseball players likely would fail.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Lefavor, another former Marine aviator, said that when
Glenn was in the service, he had to undergo what was a grueling
physical readiness test.
</P>
<P>
   Included: The ``fireman's carry,'' in which the soldier has to
run 200 meters, pick up another soldier and carry him on his back
200 meters in the other direction; a three-mile run, while carrying
rifle, pack and boots (some 30 pounds of gear); and a combination
rope climb and run in full gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a beast,'' said Lefavor, now public affairs officer for
the Naval Air Station and Joint Reserve Base at Carswell Field in
Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots like Glenn had to survive an additional battery of
daunting tests. In one, they had to go into the deep end of a pool
and stay afloat for an hour while wearing flight suit, helmets and
boots. There was also the Dilbert Dunker _ the training technique
popularized in the movie ``An Officer and a Gentleman''.
</P>
<P>
   Some physical adjustments are always necessary after such a long
layoff, though. Howe said that before his return last season with
the Vipers, he needed extra treatment on his balky knees; their
mobility had become limited by age and injury.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Howe, who credits good genes and his love of the game
for his longevity, said he felt he did as well as could be
expected. He did admit, however, that, ``The speed was more than I
was ready for.'
</P>
<P>
   For that, at least, Glenn should be ready.

 By DANNY ROBBINS  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Visiting South Bend, Ind., in January 1994 with the notion of
leaving his position as Texas A&AMP;M's defensive coordinator to fill
the same role at Notre Dame, Bob Davie was paired up with Dave
Roberts, who had recently left his job as head coach at Northeast
Louisiana to become offensive coordinator for the Fighting Irish.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Davie and Roberts viewed Notre Dame in the same light _ as a
place to polish their rsums by becoming part of the school's
football legacy. But as they toured the campus together, they
weren't exactly on the road to joining Rockne and Leahy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave was kind of my official host,'' Davie said, ``and he'd
only been here a couple of days. He did his best to give me the
tour of the campus. The problem was, about a foot of snow had hit
that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember Dave had his van, and he was showing me around the
campus. He kind of thought he was on an alleyway, some pavement,
driving around, showing me some different spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, we were right out in the middle of the campus
on the grass. We were pretty close to having to go see student
affairs before we even started our jobs here.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, having managed to keep off Notre Dame's hallowed grass,
Davie and Roberts accomplished what they had set out to do three
years earlier: They moved on to bigger things, Davie replacing Lou
Holtz as head coach of the Irish and Roberts becoming head coach at
Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, they cross paths again when Notre Dame and Baylor play
at Notre Dame Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The game will be only the second meeting between the teams.
Notre Dame and Baylor opened the 1925 season in South Bend, with
the Irish, rebuilding after the graduation of the famed Four
Horsemen, winning 41-0.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's matchup does not figure to have much historical
impact. But it will validate the decisions of two men who gave up
relatively secure positions to participate in the Notre Dame
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave left Northeast Louisiana as head football coach to come
to Notre Dame,'' Davie said, ``and it worked out well. It worked
out well for both Dave and me.''
</P>
<P>
   After five seasons as R.C. Slocum's defensive coordinator at
A&AMP;M, Davie wanted a change of scene and a higher profile.
</P>
<P>
   As a head coach at Western Kentucky and Northeast Louisiana,
Roberts had become known to college football insiders as a tireless
recruiter and an offensive innovator, but his stage, Division I-AA,
was a small one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the conversation I had with Roy Kramer, the
commissioner of the Southeastern Conference, in talking about the
Notre Dame job before I left Northeast Louisiana,'' Roberts said.
``He said, `You have to go. It may not turn out the way you want it
to turn out, but you have to go. You cannot pass on this
opportunity to go see what that (Notre Dame) is all about.'
</P>
<P>
   ``You go in with no guarantees, but there are no guarantees in
anything. I think if I would have said no, I would have regretted
it forever.''
</P>
<P>
   The major variable was Holtz, who has a history of alienating
those who work for him.
</P>
<P>
   For Roberts, the risk was compounded by the fact his passion for
the passing game did not mesh with Holtz's run-to-daylight
conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   In the three seasons Roberts and Davie were Holtz's chief
assistants, the Irish finished 6-5-1, 9-3 and 8-3 and lost both
bowl games in which they participated.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, the Irish threw the ball more but essentially stuck
to the Holtz blueprint. Quarterback Ron Powlus never lived up to
the fanfare that accompanied his enrollment at the university in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``We threw the ball 258 times one year and 279 times another, I
think, which was probably about 170 times more than we wanted to
throw it,'' Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he felt no bitterness, because the situation unfolded
pretty much as it had been represented to him by Holtz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lou and I sat down,'' he said. ``He said, `We are going to run
the football. I want to throw it. I want to know more about the
passing game. I want you to help with that. But we are going to run
the football.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I understood that very clearly _ on the front end. That's fun.
That's good. It's easy when you hand it to the tailback and he
rushes for eight yards. Makes second-and-two an easy call.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun. It was harder than _ well, you know, it was a
pretty high-intense situation. But it was an incredible
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Powlus, Roberts said: ``It seems to me _ and this is just
my opinion _ that when you're a Notre Dame quarterback, you're only
successful if you win 12. If you go 9-3 or 10-2, that's not good
enough, at least while you're there. When you return, you're a
hero. You're a saint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ron broke all of Joe Theismann's (Notre Dame) passing records.
But he didn't win 12 games, so that's the situation he had to deal
with. And I think he matured as a person, as I did, because it was
hard to watch him go through some of the stuff he had to go
through.''
</P>
<P>
   Holtz, now a college football commentator for CBS Sports, said
he hired Roberts for his expertise but never expected to make
wholesale changes in the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted his input in the passing game,'' he said, ``but you
win because you execute. And at the University of Notre Dame, it's
very difficult to have a sophisticated passing game _ very, very
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain schools that win because they play physical
and run the football: Texas, Southern Cal, Oklahoma, Alabama, Notre
Dame, Ohio State, Michigan. The minute you deviate from that,
there's not a great deal of success. Go look at history. Even Bear
Bryant couldn't successfully run a passing game at Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Notre Dame, you cannot throw the ball a great deal because,
one, with the players' academics, you can't do it year-round. They
can't develop their skills. Plus, if you're playing outstanding
competition week in and week out, which we did, it's hard to have a
great passing game because of the weather, the wind, in the
Midwest.''
</P>
<P>
   When Holtz announced his resignation in November 1996, Notre
Dame made a run at Northwestern's Gary Barnett before promoting
Davie, who had never served any school as a head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Handsome and urbane, Davie cut the kind of figure university
leaders wanted in a head coach; Roberts, a pudgy Southerner, did
not.
</P>
<P>
   Davie and Roberts discussed the possibility of Roberts remaining
at Notre Dame as offensive coordinator but came to the conclusion
that all parties would be better served if he sought a head
coaching position of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob and I talked on the plane coming back from Southern Cal,''
Roberts said. ``I said, `We're friends. I appreciate the
opportunity (to stay at Notre Dame), but I'm not going to make the
commitment for five or six years, and that's what you need at this
point.'''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts acknowledged that he faced the possibility of being out
of work but said he believed he would get the chance to become a
head coach. The door opened for him when he faxed his rsum to
Baylor athletic director Tom Stanton about 24 hours after the
university had fired Chuck Reedy.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts and Davie endured tough times last season, Baylor going
2-9 and Notre Dame losing four of its first five before finishing
7-6.
</P>
<P>
   The heat became more intense at Notre Dame last summer when
66-year-old Joe Moore, the Irish's offensive line coach from 1988
to 1996, won an age-discrimination lawsuit against the university.
</P>
<P>
   The suit included trial and deposition testimony detailing how
Moore physically and verbally abused his players. It also brought
to light deposition testimony in which Davie said ``there were
things'' about Holtz ``I hated and despised.'' He also said in the
deposition that Holtz acted erratically and was mentally unstable
at times.
</P>
<P>
   Davie said this week he has learned to accept the Notre Dame job
as the perpetual hot seat it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're at a place where there are always going to be issues,''
he said. ``But I think it teaches you to be pretty resilient. I
think it teaches you to keep your eye on the target.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said he tried to ignore news accounts of matters related
to Moore's case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hear something on the radio and cut it off,'' he said.
``Joe Moore's a friend. Bob Davie's a friend. Lou Holtz is a
friend. And Notre Dame was good to me and my family. Too many good
people. Too many things happening. I just really left it at that.''
</P>
<P>
   With the suit resolved and the Irish 5-1, Davie's life is
definitely easier these days. Roberts' team is 2-5 but has been
competitive just about every week.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said he might feel a chill when he leads the Bears onto
the field at Notre Dame Stadium. Other than that, he said, he sees
no reason for Saturday to be different from any other day on the
road.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always hear about the ghosts of Notre Dame,'' he said. ``I
didn't see any ghosts there. I think winning had something to do
with those 300-pound tackles knocking you backward. I didn't see
the Four Horsemen ride out on the field. I didn't see Johnny Lujack
help us at all. I think it's those tackles knocking people back.''

ARTHUR MERRITT, 96, RENAISSANCE MUSIC EXPERT
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arthur Tillman Merritt, a specialist in Renaissance music who
was a professor at Harvard University and director of the
university's music department for many years, died on Sunday in
Bedford, Mass. He was 96.
</P>
<P>
   Merritt was an influential scholar whose publications included
``Sixteenth Century Counterpoint'' (1939) and editions of the vocal
works of Janequin (1971, with Francois Lesure) and Andrea Gabrieli
(1981-84).
</P>
<P>
   Although illuminating the music of the Renaissance was his
principal work, his classes covered everything from harmony and
counterpoint to the history of 20th-century music, and throughout
his career, involvement with contemporary music was a major part of
his work. When he organized a symposium on music criticism at
Harvard in 1947, he commissioned new chamber, choral and dance
pieces from Copland, Hindemith, Malipiero, Martinu, Piston,
Schoenberg and Schuman for the occasion. Merritt was also the
chairman of the Fromm Music Foundation, which supports new music,
in 1972 and 1973.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in 1902 in Calhoun, Mo. He earned degrees at the
University of Missouri and Harvard, and from 1927 to 1929 was a
student of Nadia Boulanger and Paul Dukas in Paris. He joined the
Harvard music faculty as an assistant in 1929. In 1930 he left
Harvard to establish the music program at Trinity College in
Hartford, Conn., but he returned to Harvard as a music instructor
in 1932 and became a full professor in 1943.
</P>
<P>
   Merritt was chairman of the music department from 1942 to 1952
and from 1968 to 1972. He established several endowed
professorships and raised money to build the Fanny P. Mason Music
Building, which opened in 1971. He was also curator of the Isham
Memorial Library at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   No immediate family members survive.

STARS JUGGLE LINES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hoping to spark the Stars' even-strength goal production, coach
Ken Hitchcock said he expects to do some situational line juggling
this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   With a healthy lineup at his disposal and games against the
Mighty Ducks of Anaheim tomorrow and Detroit Red Wings on Saturday,
Hitchcock plans to move Grant Marshall to the second line, pair up
Pat Verbeek with Tony Hrkac and offer extra ice time to Brett Hull
and Jamie Langenbrunner. The tweaks should give the Stars three
lines with strong offensive capabilities and generate more
five-on-five scoring for a team that has produced only six
even-strength goals in seven games. The Stars' overall scoring
average has dropped from 2.95 goals a game last season to 2.71 this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's magnified because every game is a one-goal game for us,''
Hitchcock said ``When we have the opportunity to extend our lead
and put the hammer down, we need to take advantage of those things.
And we haven't been doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are 5-1-1 thanks in large part to strong defense,
solid goaltending and an impressive power play. Hitchcock's lineup,
which consists of six players who have scored 23 or more goals in
one of the past two seasons, is expected to start producing goals.
</P>
<P>
   The coach's solution is to move Marshall from the fourth line
right wing onto the second line in place of Verbeek. Marshall will
play with Langenbrunner and Joe Nieuwendyk, giving the Stars a
solid second offensive line behind the top trio of Hull, Mike
Modano and Jere Lehtinen.
</P>
<P>
   Verbeek will then move onto a line with center Tony Hrkac. But
instead of a fourth line meant to check or grind down the
opposition as it has done this season, the Hrkac line will show
versatility. Tough-guy Brent Severyn will play between two and five
minutes in a grinding role, and the rest of his time _ about 10
minutes _ will be taken up by Hull or Langenbrunner.
</P>
<P>
   A line of Hull, Hrkac and Verbeek could give the Stars plenty of
offensive jump to complement the other two offensively capable
lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to take advantage of the people who are playing
well,'' said Hitchcock, referring to Hull and Verbeek. ``It's still
a four-line rotation, it's just that it's not four of the same
lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock used the same formula in Saturday's 2-1 victory
against the San Jose Sharks, and Hull finished with 24 minutes of
ice time. It was a welcome change for the winger, who is not
killing penalties this season and can become stale on the bench if
a game gets heavy in special-teams play.
</P>
<P>
   ``For him to effective, he has to be involved in the game,''
Hitchcock said. ``Brett Hull needs to be out on the ice in
different situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Verbeek should also see more ice time, and all of the top
offensive players will get the majority of time on the power play,
Hitchcock said. In five-on-five situations, the Stars hope for
stronger chemistry from new combinations. Hitchcock pointed
specifically to Hrkac and Verbeek.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hrkac knows when to give pucks to people when they're in
better position than he is,'' Hitchcock said. ``And Verbeek knows
that if he gives it back to Hrkac, Hrkac is going to buy time for
Verbeek to get open and he's going to hit him.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall said he has seen his game improve playing on a line
with Langenbrunner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has so much jump and he's so consistent right now, I think
he's really helped my game,'' Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   That said, all the players said they know this experiment could
last for a month or one game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be ready for anything,'' Nieuwendyk said. ``We've
all played with each other when players have been hurt, so we
should be able to shuffle around during a game.'' Turek to play
Hitchcock said he expects to start goalie Roman Turek against the
Mighty Ducks tomorrow and play Ed Belfour against the Red Wings on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Turek has played one game and is 1-0 with a 1.00 goals-against
average.
</P>
<P>
   Lining up for a change Stars coach Ken Hitchcock has preached
rolling four balanced lines. However, he expects to do some line
juggling against Anaheim and Detroit this weekend to get more ice
time for Brett Hull and Pat Verbeek. Here's how the Stars' line
should look.
Brett Hull-Mike Modano-Jere Lehtinen
</P>
<P>
   The top offensive line, top checking line, No. 1 power-play unit
and top penalty-killing pair in Modano and Lehtinen. Jamie
Langenbrunner-Joe Nieuwendyk-Grant Marshall
</P>
<P>
   A No. 2 line that's skilled and tough. Marshall's addition makes
this line better defensively. Dave Reid or Brian Skrudland-Guy
Carbonneau-Mike Keane
</P>
<P>
   A solid checking line, although age is a concern as far as
endurance goes. Brent Severyn-Tony Hrkac-Pat Verbeek
</P>
<P>
   Severyn can be replaced by Hull or Langenbrunner at any given
moment, giving the line a big boost in offensive potential.

 &HT;    Buffett asks fans to support MacKay
 &HT;    By Shirish Date
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TITUSVILLE _ Warning that Jeb Bush in the Governor's Mansion
could ``eradicate'' protections for Florida's Everglades and
manatees, pop legend Jimmy Buffett Wednesday asked his legions of
fans to throw their support behind Lt. Gov. Buddy MacKay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeb and I have a history of disagreeing on the environment,''
Buffett told a mix of his Parrotheads and MacKay faithful in front
of a hangar at Titusville Space Center Executive Airport. ``I'm not
going to sit back, if I can help it, and let a Texas oil man become
governor of Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   MacKay, trailing Bush in the polls with less than a week to go
until the election, let Buffett take most of the attention from
fans toting his books, posters and records in hopes of an
autograph. ``This endorsement means everything to me,'' MacKay
said.
</P>
<P>
   The entertainer, in Brevard County to cover John Glenn's space
launch for Rolling Stone magazine, has also promised an appearance
at a MacKay rally in West Palm Beach tonight. Though best known
politically for his longtime friendship with U.S. Sen. Bob Graham,
Buffett said he has known MacKay almost as long and has always
counted on his support for environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   Although MacKay's Brevard staff passed out signs for supporters
to wave before the television cameras, it was clear Wednesday that
Buffett, not MacKay, was the main attraction. Prominent Democratic
lobbyist Guy Spearman showed up with two copies of Buffett's recent
memoirs to get them autographed _ gifts for clients, Spearman said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Waddell, 24, called in sick at his job with several fellow
fraternity brothers from Kappa Sigma _ Buffett's fraternity. Would
the Orlando resident have come had it been just MacKay?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he shrugged. ``I probably would be working.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who enjoys his own celebrity status at his appearances,
has worked hard this campaign to tout his environmental policies,
including support for an extension of the popular Preservation 2000
land buying program. Although born in Midlands, Texas, he has lived
in Miami for the past 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett, though, said it wasn't enough simply to move to
Florida, ``change your drivers license and fill your swimming
pool,'' echoing MacKay's frequent criticism that Bush without his
family name would not be a serious contender for the state's
highest office.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Jeb's last name was Smith, he'd probably be working at True
Value hardware, not running for governor,'' Buffett said.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay later Wednesday attended a reception in Coral Gables. He
is scheduled to watch today's space shuttle launch at the Kennedy
Space Center before coming to Palm Beach County this afternoon for
a last-minute fund-raiser with President Clinton and then the rally
with Buffett this evening.

 &HT;    Media, NASA fans flock around former Mercury astronauts
 &HT;    By Paul Reid
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TITUSVILLE, Fla. _ If the scene Wednesday at the Astronaut Hall
of Fame was any indication, NASA achieved a mighty media event by
sending John Glenn back into space.
</P>
<P>
   While more than 120 members of the media queried three former
Mercury astronauts about the significance of Glenn's flight, fewer
than 30 members of the public looked on from behind chains.
</P>
<P>
   The media wielded 18 mini-cams, dozens of telephoto lenses and
scores of notebooks.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Cooper and Wally Schirra were much enthused for Glenn and
the future of the space program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life begins at 77,'' said Schirra.
</P>
<P>
   But Scott Carpenter was more analytical. ``One 77-year-old does
not a database make,'' he said. ``But John Glenn is sending a
message _ the future of space travel belongs to people of all
ages.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene was much the same 8 miles away at the Kennedy Space
Center, except there were no old astronauts. There, more than 3,500
members of the media could be found a few hours earlier. Overflow
parking lots overflowed with trucks bearing satellite dishes. At
T-minus 26 hours, the press center was wired for a story still more
than a day away. Various TV personalities took to interviewing each
other.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, prime public viewing areas were not as crowded as
predicted. About 70 RVs were parked along Route 1 in Titusville,
while a few dozen launch enthusiasts had set up camp near Jetty
Park in Cocoa Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Local motels were full.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the press, mostly,'' said Alice Sharier, owner of Alice's
Restaurant in Titusville.
</P>
<P>
   ``But wait till Thursday,'' she said. ``NASA expects 120,000
people to watch the launch.''

 By FRAN BLINEBURY  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
YOU have to admit, if you're a Rockets season-ticket holder, that
up until now this NBA labor lockout has been a pretty sweet deal.
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the irresponsible owners and the spoiled players have been
dug into their respective bunkers in the name of principles and
ideology, you've been digging a hole in your back yard to stash
your unexpected cash.
</P>
<P>
   Their logjam has been your windfall.
</P>
<P>
   For even though Leslie Alexander _ like the rest of the owners _
has already collected full payment on your season tickets, you've
been content to know that the money for all unpaid games is being
held in escrow, growing at 6 percent, compounded daily, and will
eventually be returned.
</P>
<P>
   Cha-ching! It's money in the bank. The only thing missing is
free checking.
</P>
<P>
   So what if the so-called negotiations dragged on into early
October, forcing the cancellation of the first two weeks of the
regular season? That just meant the loss of three home games off an
increasingly dull schedule.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't break your heart to miss the opening-night visit by
the Pistons. How many times can you listen to the hype that Grant
Hill is the next great thing until you wonder when he'll get past
the second round of the playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   So what if the Rockets lost a home date with Utah? It's one less
time you have to sit through that drip-drip-drip water-torture
offense of the Jazz and the cheap, illegal picks by John Stockton
and the outrageous flops by Karl Malone without losing your voice
screaming at the referees.
</P>
<P>
   And is there anybody anywhere who has ever gotten excited to
watch the Clippers play? When you're paying for the entire,
national-debt-priced package of 41, those Clippers tickets _ and
Kings, Grizzlies, Mavs, Warriors and Raptors tickets _ are the ones
you try to sell off to your not-so-bright brother-in-law. But even
he usually doesn't fall for that stunt. So you end up giving them
to your barber or manicurist or pass them off as a tip to the kid
who loads your cart at the supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, there is the lockout rearing its head and saying that
not only do you not have to watch the Clippers play, you don't have
to pay for them, either.
</P>
<P>
   This is like turning over your sofa cushions and having gold
doubloons fall out onto the floor. Almost like seeing Ed McMahon
and Dick Clark show up at your front door carrying a check. With
the refunded cash from three home games, at current whopping NBA
prices, you can think about buying that new Jaguar for Christmas.
Or a ski vacation in Colorado. Or even Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   This had been rapidly turning into the Dream Season. All you
really wanted were playoff tickets anyway and maybe a few others.
Shaq and the Lakers, the I-10 rivalry with the Spurs, the annual
wars with the Sonics, Patrick and the Knicks and, of course
</P>
<P>
   Da Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Uh-oh.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA office announced Wednesday that the entire first month
of the schedule was being wiped out, and that means the Nov. 19
visit by Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's serious. Finally, they've crossed the line.
</P>
<P>
   We can all survive quite nicely without Allen Iverson or Bob
Sura for a season. But when you eliminate the marquee team in the
league _ the franchise of the decade in all pro sports _ you are
making the fans upon whose backs the NBA rests pay the price.
</P>
<P>
   No Michael Jordan anymore, you say? I say he's just playing coy
and trying to boost the sales of his new book with the retirement
scare. No Scottie Pippen? Don't bet on it just yet. But those are
both topics for another day.
</P>
<P>
   No bull. No Bulls. Which makes that season ticket kind of like
an edition of Playboy without the pictures. There is talk of an
adjusted schedule at some point. But the point is that the lockout
has finally hit home here in Houston and negotiations have gone
nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   The undisciplined owners and the unbending players obviously
need help. So here it is:
</P>
<P>
   A modified Larry Bird system, which would apply to just two
players on each team. Annual raises in new contracts could be no
higher than 10 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Each team would be given a $3 million lump-sum exception to the
salary cap _ to be split any way it wanted _ once every two years.
</P>
<P>
   A minimum salary of $500,000 per player, which would rise by
$100,000 per season, thereby taking care of veteran journeymen.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie pay scale would be extended to four years with a
right of first refusal for the drafting team.
</P>
<P>
   No contracts longer than five years.
</P>
<P>
   All basketball-related income split 50-50 by the owners and
players.
</P>
<P>
   Now play ball. And find a way to get the Bulls here.

LAWRENCE DOYCE HANCOCK, 85, ENTREPRENEUR AND PHILANTHROPIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lawrence Doyce Hancock, a philanthropist who parlayed his L.D.
Hancock Co. into Hancock Fabrics, one of the nation's largest
retail fabric chains, died on Oct. 5 at the North Mississippi
Medical Center after a brief illness. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock's career began inauspiciously. Armed with just a high
school education, he started out as a door-to-door salesman
peddling sundries and candies. After serving three and a half years
in the Navy in World War II, Hancock returned to his native Tupelo,
Miss., expanded his business to include fabrics, changed its name
to the Hancock Textile Co. and started opening stores.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he merged his company with Lucky Stores of
California in 1971, Hancock Textile had 81 company stores and 265
franchise stores in 19 states. Fifteen years later, Lucky spun off
the business, renamed Hancock Fabrics, as a public company. Today,
the company operates 480 stores in 38 states, employs 6,700 people
and has annual sales of close to $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock spent the last decade of his life as a cattle rancher,
orange grower, real estate developer and philanthropist. He
established the Hancock Foundation, which supports evangelistic
work overseas, and a program in the United States to teach reading
and math to students with learning difficulties. Tupelo High School
and the Tupelo Salvation Army sit on land donated by Hancock.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, the former Elaine Graham; four
children, Doyce Deas, Lauren Patterson, Larry Hancock and Janice
Allen, all of Tupelo; four sisters, Ruby Kennon of New Albany,
Miss., Earline Edwards of Memphis, Theresa Kilgore of Tupelo and
Odessa Clayton of Montgomery, Ala.; two brothers, Delma Hancock of
Darden, Miss., and Herman Hancock of Asheville, N.C.; 11
grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren. &QL;

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
IF the clock were running, Houston would be back in the pro
football business today. But since time is apparently of no essence
whatsover to the NFL owners as they ponder adding a 32nd expansion
franchise, I think we're dead.
</P>
<P>
   Well, OK, dying.
</P>
<P>
   Unless, of course, Bob McNair can steal away somebody else's
team. Or somebody else's team relocates to Los Angeles, and the
sooner the better.
</P>
<P>
   The latter possibility is one of several reasons why time is of
no essence. See, anyone out there still stuck with a bad stadium or
a bad stadium deal _ and there remain a few laggards, amazingly
enough _ wants to keep his options open.
</P>
<P>
   I'd say hers, too, but surely ex-showgirl Georgia Frontiere
wouldn't dare try to stiff St. Louis, a most benevolent community,
and go home to Hollywood would she?
</P>
<P>
   Pro football's owners, sitting on the grandest of all sporting
gold mines, are in no hurry to fold the last great extortionary
hole card they have left. And the longer this dog-and-pony show
drags out, the shorter Houston's straw becomes because the lone
advantage we do hold over the warring LaLa Land contingents at
present is that our ducks are already neatly in a row.
</P>
<P>
   McNair has done a superb job. But he has done everything he can
do. That the NFL types weren't more unabashedly, and singularly,
appreciative of his impressive efforts _ never mind the quality of
his person _ was a bad-news message. No one appeared willing to pay
much homage to the clear-cut superiority of McNair's very together
package.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the Angelenos can only grow stronger before the April
expansion decision. And believe me, all things being equal, we are
not equal to LA in anyone's eyes except, presumably, our own.
Offering up the world's first retractable-roof grass-field football
stadium sounds pretty cool until you crunch the demographic
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, the West Coasters are the 800-pound gorilla;
we're at best the cute little puppy in the window.
</P>
<P>
   That we've got a pulse says everything you need to know about
the mindset of the gentlemen (and woman) who will determine whether
Houston's NFL exile is temporary. They fear a heinous precedent is
being set by glitzy Michael Ovitz and the canny Ed Roski with these
guys appearing way too eager to put up the bulk of the money
themselves, as opposed to tapping into the public's.
</P>
<P>
   Madness, that. Shear madness.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, I believe we all know the NFL doesn't need 32 teams.
An increasingly shoddy product offers up much evidence that it
doesn't even need 30. However, having felt beholden to Cleveland
for the ultimate of blindsides, the league created a scheduling
problem by adding No. 31.
</P>
<P>
   With an odd number, somebody has to be off every weekend,
creating competition complications. That's why Houston and Los
Angeles, two cities the NFL would dearly want (as opposed to, say,
Indianapolis and Nashville), can't now both come to the dance.
There will be no 33rd franchise in our lifetime, because it would
require a 34th.
</P>
<P>
   Memphis? Hardly, after the Oilers' debacle there. San Antonio?
Not unless Red McCombs moves the Vikings into his back yard.
Portland? No chance with Paul Allen owning the Seahawks. Orlando?
Tampa Bay would never, ever stand for it. Where then? Albuquerque?
Fargo? Bangor?
</P>
<P>
   See, after Houston, the precipice. Nothingness. We are a matched
set of one.
</P>
<P>
   We're also a tad short on friends, the many flapping jaws to the
contrary. While only Alex Spanos in San Diego would have a clearly
vested interest in keeping Los Angeles NFL-less, Jerry Jones, Tom
Benson and maybe McCombs _ whose heart is here, not up in Siberia _
are all better off with Houston on the outside looking in.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Bud Adams. Can you possibly be naive enough to
believe he wants to see another guy get what he couldn't get for
the Oilers from Houston?
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, yeah, I realize everyone is saying the right things.
McNair has gone to especially great lengths to applaud Adams'
graciousness _ like he has a choice. The circumstances demand a
certain amount of groveling. You swallow hard, hitch up your
britches and just do it.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, please. Jones, whose ego is as big as Texas, doesn't
want to share Texas, and Benson sees Houston as a secondary market
for his sinning Saints, who almost always have extra seats to sell.
</P>
<P>
   McCombs? Given his current giddy state _ first, a
steal-of-the-century purchase of the Vikings, then the 7-0 start _
he seems a benign factor, but what if he still secretly dreams of
moving the Vikes to San Antonio? Doesn't it make sense for him to
keep the Houston market vacant as an insurance policy?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, ol' Red is a right fine fellow, a cut above most of his
peers. He is, however, also a hard-edged businessman. You rarely
get rich being kind. And getting rich _ or richer, I should say _
is really what will shape the expansion decision in the end.
</P>
<P>
   So, based on what transpired in Kansas City on Tuesday, I fear
we are headed for a fall, right through the cracks. Fairness isn't
part of this equation.

GAMES LOST INCLUDE BULLS' TRIP TO VALLEY  
 EARLIEST SEASON COULD START IS DEC. 1 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The NBA lopped two more weeks off a season that was supposed to
tip off next week when Commissioner David Stern announced Wednesday
that another block of games has been canceled because of the
league's labor impasse.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Granik, deputy commissioner, said the next announcement
from the league will be all or nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see any point to making further announcements about
our schedule until we either make a deal or cancel the season
entirely,'' Granik said. ``Going forward, the rule of thumb is that
for each week that goes by without a new agreement, we lose one
more week of games.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern and Granik have refused to pinpoint a date at which time
the entire season will be scratched, but both have indicated that
mid-January is likely the latest the league can go. On Wednesday,
Stern raised the possibility of adjusting dates and rescheduling
canceled games if a collective bargaining agreement is reached.
</P>
<P>
   But arena availability might make major schedule adjustments
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns already had lost five home games and a road game in the
first purge. Wednesday's announcement means the Suns will lose
seven more games, including a home contest against the three-time
defending NBA champion Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   The newest cancellations include a home game against Atlanta, a
three-game road trip to Boston, Washington and Toronto, a home game
against the Golden State Warriors, a road trip to Seattle _ where
the Suns would have faced former Coach Paul Westphal for the first
time _ and the Chicago home game.
</P>
<P>
   If no more games are canceled, the Suns will open what becomes a
69-game schedule on Dec. 1, when the Utah Jazz are scheduled to
visit America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Suns General Manager Bryan Colangelo said this week that the
club will not lay off employees because of the work stoppage.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the start, we have had no plans to make any layoffs
during this,'' Colangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns and Diamondbacks share some employees and services. The
entire operation and its subsidiaries employ about 2,400 people,
600 full time and about 1,800 part time.
</P>
<P>
   While reports of optimism in labor talks between the league and
players union emerged over the weekend, progress remains slow.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the lockout, which was imposed by owners on
July 1, is a debate over a hard salary cap that owners want to
impose.
</P>
<P>
   Ownership seeks to roll back the amount of basketball revenue
that goes to players from the 57 percent they got out of almost $2
billion in revenue last season to 52 percent by the 1999-2000
season and 48 percent by 2002-03.
</P>
<P>
   Stern and Granik have said that about half of the league's 29
teams either lost money or broke even last season.
</P>
<P>
   The players _ or their representatives _ do not believe the
numbers. The union has proposed that 63 percent of revenue be paid
to players.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, agent Arn Tellem, a member of the agents advisory
board to the players, said several owners are making huge profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is the Lakers, the New York Knicks, the Boston
Celtics or Chicago Bulls or Phoenix Suns are making profits of
roughly $80 million a year into (Lakers owner) Jerry Buss' pocket,
into (Suns President) Jerry Colangelo's pocket, or (Bulls owner)
Jerry Reinsdorf's pocket,'' Tellem said. ``So the question is, is
that fair? There's obviously money there, so that money has to be
distributed to other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Colangelo said Tellem's math is questionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made about a million dollars in profit last season,''
Colangelo said. ``I can't speak for others, but we showed a million
dollars in profit. And after Chicago paid Michael Jordan
(reportedly $33 million last season), they made very little money.
You would be surprised how little the Bulls made.''
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo was in New York for the league's Board of Governors
meetings, which were taking place across the street from where
labor negotiations are to take place. In all, 194 NBA games have
been lost. &QL;

SWANN'S INJURY THRUSTS SWINGER INTO SPOTLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Little was known about Cardinals defensive lineman Rashod
Swinger until recently.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't skip college and go from semi-pro to the NFL (see Eric
Swann). He didn't go from a walk-on to a first-team All-American
(see Andre Wadsworth). He didn't tie an NFL rookie sack record and
then play pro basketball (see Simeon Rice). He wasn't even a
seventh-round draft pick who wound up making the NFL's All-Rookie
team (see Mark Smith).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a role player,'' Swinger said. ``I go in the game when a
guy needs a break. My job has been pretty minimal.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't anymore. Swinger, who had played in only one NFL game
before this season, will start at left defensive tackle in place of
the injured Swann on Sunday in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not Eric Swann,'' Swinger said of the two-time Pro Bowl
performer who underwent arthroscopic knee surgery Wednesday and is
expected miss about four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not that type of player. I'm more of a run stopper. But I
have to step my game up. I know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Swinger's coaches have confidence in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the ultimate team guy,'' defensive coordinator Dave
McGinnis said. ``He'll do whatever you ask him to do. He's a very
conscientious guy who will work his butt off. We don't expect him
to be Eric Swann. We just expect (Swinger) to go in and do his
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Swinger likely will rotate with veteran Bernard Wilson at the
tackle spot. Wilson was a starter for five seasons until he lost
his job to Smith late last season.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive line coach Joe Greene said he thinks replacing Swann
by committee can work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our attitude is we all have to pick up the load,'' Greene
said. ``That's how it should be, and I hope that's how it will
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice said he knows the Lions ``are going to try to mess with
(Swinger) a little bit,'' but he is confident Swinger will play
well.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback J.J. McCleskey said Swinger has been the biggest
surprise on defense this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is he has got to make plays, and he does,''
McCleskey said. ``He doesn't have a (big) name, but he's a very
underrated player.''
</P>
<P>
   Swinger has an unusual first name. He was named for former
Cardinals and Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Ahmad Rashad. ``He
was my father's favorite football player,'' Swinger said.
</P>
<P>
   He also is an amateur artist. He draws sketches, mostly of
cartoon characters like Batman and Superman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't draw humans,'' he said. ``I'm not fantastic, but it
keeps me busy. I don't show the (drawings) to anybody. I keep them
in my room.''
</P>
<P>
   Swinger turned down a chance to go to Notre Dame, Syracuse, Penn
State and Boston College to stay close to home in New Jersey and
play for Rutgers. But the Scarlet Knights had only one winning
record in his four seasons there.
</P>
<P>
   Swinger, 6 feet 2, 286 pounds, expected to be drafted after his
senior year in 1997. When he wasn't selected, he signed as a free
agent with San Diego after also considering the Cardinals and
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers released him twice last fall. ``I was crushed,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after he flew home to New Jersey, the Cardinals called and
signed him. He spent most of last season on the practice squad but
was activated for the season finale against Atlanta because of a
finger injury to Swann. He had seven tackles and impressed the
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Swinger was considered a long shot to make the Cardinals this
season because the team was deep on the defensive line. But Brad
Ottis suffered a foot injury and was placed on injured reserve, and
Wadsworth didn't sign until 24 hours before the Sept. 6 opener at
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know how much (playing) time I was going to get,'' he
said. ``I just wanted to get on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   He played so well in the preseason that he became the top
reserve tackle. Then when Swann's knee kept him from starting
against Chicago and New York the past two games, Swinger started in
his spot. &QL;

FRIGHT NIGHT'S PAINFUL PLIGHT  
 ARIZONA STATE FREE SAFETY AT LESS THAN 100% 
</HEADLINE>
 STATE-FREEDMAN-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's twilight for Fright Night, the waning days of a long,
interesting career marked by success and disappointment, loss and
recovery. And pain.
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, Arizona State senior free safety Mitchell
Freedman usually is the one who gives rather than receives, the
inflictor, not the inflictee. But not this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My knee, my toe,'' he said after a recent practice, listing
what hurts. ``My back has kind of tightened up, and my groin is
real sore. I'm basically feeling it all over.''
</P>
<P>
   So is the ASU defense, of which Freedman was supposed to be a
key component. He still is, but injuries and inexperience have had
an overall effect. Going into Saturday's game at Washington State,
the Sun Devils (3-4) are yielding nearly 27 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   Don't pin the blame solely on Freedman, out of Maryvale High
School, who started his final season as a Jim Thorpe Award
candidate (given to the nation's best defensive back) and with a
reputation as a scary hitter that earned the nickname ``Fright
Night.'' But his performance has been admittedly less than
intimidating, representative of what's bedeviling the entire unit.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries are the main reason. Freedman's health problems started
at Camp Tontozona, and he has been sound basically for just one
game. He probably will undergo arthroscopic surgery on his right
knee after the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his season has really been impacted by camp, by being
injured almost all through camp,'' Coach Bruce Snyder said. ``He's
an interesting kid. He has so much confidence, he believes if he
just lines up, he can play ball. Because he's always been able to
do it. . . . But I think he's beginning to realize the value of
being in great shape and being injury-free.''
</P>
<P>
   Said defensive coordinator Phil Snow, ``He's really banged up.
He's been around the ball quite a bit, but he's just not tackling
and running like he did a year ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Freedman laughs at his various afflictions, saying ``you've just
got to take the pain and keep on going.''
</P>
<P>
   But missing are the big hits and big plays, like last year when
he blitzed Washington State quarterback Ryan Leaf and forced the
future No. 2 draft pick to fumble, leading to a comeback victory.
Or the game against Washington, when he had 15 tackles. Or the game
against Southern California, when he had a tone-setting
interception in the first quarter. Freedman was All-Pac-10 in 1997,
an honor he is unlikely to duplicate.
</P>
<P>
   Freedman, in fact, was on the wrong end of what might have been
the biggest play of the year, in the opener. On fourth down and
long in the final seconds and Washington trailing by three, Huskies
quarterback Brock Huard found tight end Reggie Davis. Freedman came
over and tried to strip the ball instead of tackling Davis or
pushing him out of bounds. Davis scored on a 63-yard pass play and
Washington won, 42-38.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just another one of those plays you take on the
forehead,'' Freedman said.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of cornerback Jason Simmons and particularly strong
safety Damien Richardson can't be discounted. Now a rookie with the
Carolina Panthers, Richardson was a smart, solid player, a leader
on and off the field. He and Freedman developed a unique chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss him a lot,'' Freedman said. ``I played with him for the
last three years, and you kind of get that bonding going on. It
took a while to get everything clicking and to get the mix going
together, but me and Damien, the combination we had, that was the
best. He taught me a few things, and I taught him a few things.''
</P>
<P>
   Freedman laughed again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a lot of things,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, there is less action in the middle of the field,
Freedman's turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's really coming into my area,'' he said. ``They're
going to the outside. They're going underneath. I'm out of the
picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Snow said offenses this year are more spread out, ``and Mitch
hasn't had the opportunity to make as many plays.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest in a line of Maryvale defensive backs that includes
pros Darren Woodson and Phillippi Sparks, Freedman failed to meet
NCAA entrance requirements coming out of high school and sat out.
Then he redshirted in 1994. After a two-year football absence, he
became an immediate starter, making second-team All-Pac-10 in 1995.
He did it again in 1996, the Rose Bowl year, when he forced three
fumbles in the 19-0 upset of Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Before his junior season, Freedman was kicked off the team
because of a poor attitude but came back after making the necessary
adjustments. He was academically ineligible before this season,
which required a heavy course load at Mesa Community College and
ASU. He persevered.
</P>
<P>
   Freedman also fathered a child, but his sense of responsibility
led to bypassing the NFL draft and returning to school. Mitchell
Jr. turns 1 next week, and Freedman will be around to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been at every home game,'' he said of his son. ``He's the
first person I'm looking for when I step out of the tunnel.''
</P>
<P>
   Freedman's season hasn't gone as planned and he might have
slipped a few rungs in the NFL draft, but he said he has no
regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to go to the NFL,'' he said, ``and after this
season, I know I'll still be able to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time somebody thought I was going to drop down, I seemed
to pick myself up and take care of it. Whenever somebody has doubts
about me, I can take the doubts out of their mind. I had a lot of
things to take care of that most people couldn't take care of. I'll
always be happy that I did it. The most they thought they'd get out
of me was two years. I've given them five.'' &QL;

STATION CASINO EDGES INTO LEAD IN GAMING MARKET, BUT FOR HOW
LONG? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Station Casino now is Kansas City's gambling market leader _ by
a nose.
</P>
<P>
   The area's newest and largest gambling facility dethroned
longtime leader Harrah's North Kansas City Casino &AMP; Hotel in
September, with revenue of $12.70 million, compared with $12.69
million raked in by Harrah's two gambling boats.
</P>
<P>
   Harrah's reign over Station lasted 18 months. According to
Missouri Gaming Commission reports, Station's September market edge
was .02 of a percentage point, about $8,400.
</P>
<P>
   ``A dollar will do it,'' Station General Manager John Finamore
said Tuesday. ``With all the ups and downs we've had, I couldn't be
prouder.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrah's General Manager Michael St. Pierre did not take the
news lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can assure you Station will not enjoy an
18-consecutive-month run in leading the market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Station came into this market, many people thought they
would immediately dominate...This is a reflection of the intensity
of the competition in Kansas City.''
</P>
<P>
   Finamore said Station's 2,200 employees were treated to steak
dinners Tuesday. But he also said the company would hold off on
further celebrations until after next Tuesday, when Missouri voters
decide on the future of gambling in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed Amendment 9 to the Missouri Constitution would
retroactively legalize Station's twin casinos and eight other
gambling vessels statewide that are moored off river.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kansas City area, only Argosy Riverside Casino isn't
threatened with shutdown because of the ``boats in moats''
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The issue grew from a lawsuit filed in 1996 by St. Louis area
gambling foes. They argued successfully before the Missouri Supreme
Court last year that games of chance could be offered only on boats
upon the main channels of the Missouri and Mississippi rivers _ not
moored behind floodgates or in the off-river, man-made ponds and
lagoons authorized by the Gaming Commission and General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The Gaming Commission last year sought to enforce that ruling
against 10 of the state's riverboat casinos that were alleged by
the commission's staff to be in violation of the court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   But the companies sued, stalling the hearings while they
gathered signatures on petitions to overturn the court decision at
the polls.
</P>
<P>
   At risk are casinos' licenses to offer games of chance,
including slot machines, which provide about two-thirds of their
revenue. Without slots, casinos would be forced to close.
</P>
<P>
   Station's climb to the top of the Kansas City market followed a
disappointingly slow start and negative publicity over huge layoffs
and a still-pending lawsuit by the former general manager, who was
blamed for the casino's early financial woes and was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good story, compared to where we were a year ago.''
Finamore said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Station's corporate earnings before taxes, interest and other
fixed expenses have been improving, and Kansas City's share of that
is steadily growing, Finamore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pulling our weight now'' on the corporate books, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City casino must do just that, said Harry Curtis,
gaming analyst for BancBoston Robertson Stephens. He estimates that
Kansas City's earnings contribution will more than double this year
_ to $31 million from $14 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The parent firm is debt-leveraged, Curtis said, and he estimates
that much of the future earnings potential for Station's investors
will come as the company pays down that debt.
</P>
<P>
   A severe economic downturn or political defeat that closes
casinos would ``increase the risk of default'' on that debt, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   While revenue is improving, Station is the only Kansas City
casino not performing to capacity.
</P>
<P>
   In September, a combined 9,506 gambling positions _ places for
gamblers at slot machines or table games _ were spread among the
area's four casino companies.
</P>
<P>
   The huge Station Casino operates 44.3 percent of them, but
claimed just 34.7 percent of the market's dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Harrah's captured an almost identical 34.7 percent share of
dollars, with just 27.6 percent of the market's gambling capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leading the market in gross revenues is only one measure of
success,'' said Harrah's St. Pierre. ``There are others (including
the revenue) per position premium that we continue to enjoy in the
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Finamore shrugs off concerns over his casino's excess capacity,
which can eat away at profitability.
</P>
<P>
   ``People make a bigger deal out of that than need be,'' he said.
``We don't focus on that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The property is built for growth, and you've seen that growth
over the past year. What we've strived to do is build profitable
market share and cash flow.''
</P>
<P>
   Station also reaps less per gambler per two-hour session _
$19.58 _ than Harrah's, which reported a September average of
$25.18. The statewide average is $21.30.
</P>
<P>
   But Finamore also sees an upside there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to have a higher win per gambler,'' he said. ``But
it's the nature of our property. We get a lot of tourists, a lot of
out-of-towners.''
</P>
<P>
   The smaller Argosy Riverside and Flamingo Hilton casinos in
Kansas City each operate about 14 percent of the positions. Argosy
claimed a 16 percent market share last month; the Flamingo was
right on target with a 14 percent share.
</P>
<P>
   Station stockholders may be in for a rocky ride a while longer,
according to Curtis.
</P>
<P>
   Election returns Tuesday in Missouri and California will affect
the company's primary markets here and in Las Vegas. Meanwhile, a
pending lawsuit in a failed merger effort threatens to drain $54
million from company coffers.

DOE RUN WITHDRAWS BID TO MINE FOR LEAD IN THE OZARKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MANSUR  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Doe Run Co. has decided to withdraw its applications to
prospect for lead beneath federal forests in the Missouri Ozarks.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt announced the withdrawal
this week, apparently ending a battle that since the early 1980s
had set the state's environmental community against the St.
Louis-based mining company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased that a potential threat to the Ozark National
Scenic Riverways has been removed by the Doe Run Company's decision
to withdraw...'' Babbitt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mining is a valuable industry, and mining jobs are good jobs,
but mining should not be allowed to threaten very special places
like Yellowstone and the Ozark National Scenic Riverways.''
</P>
<P>
   Doe Run had applied to prospect on 7,000-plus acres of the Mark
Twain National Forest, not far from the Eleven Point, Jacks Fork
and Current rivers in the Ozarks of south-central Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri environmental groups cheered the company's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hot diggity dang,'' said Roger Pryor of the Missouri Coalition
for the Environment upon hearing of Babbitt's announcement. ``This
is just terrific....This is a major victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those Ozark watersheds are of national significance. And the
geology there is such that there's just no way to consider mining
there without great risk to the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Doe Run officials expressed disappointment over their decision
to withdraw, delivered just this week in a letter to Interior
Department officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're extremely disappointed,'' said Walter Nowotny, a Doe Run
spokesman. ``To us, Congress has made it clear that the national
forests are for multiple uses (including mining).''
</P>
<P>
   The company decided to withdraw after it became clear, Nowotny
said, that the Interior Department was asking it to relinquish too
many of its future legal rights in order to prospect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were disappointed that Interior was equating giving
permission to prospect with giving permission to mine,'' Nowotny
said. ``We believe that's fundamentally wrong. And agreeing to it
would have set a bad precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups had contended that allowing Doe Run to
prospect was tantamount to allowing it to mine. If the company
found a valuable mineral deposit, they argued, federal regulation
would essentially ensure that it could mine that deposit.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Department's chief legal counsel agreed this spring
with the environmental groups. He suggested that Babbitt offer Doe
Run a prospecting permit, but only on the condition that Doe Run
concede any future rights to mine to the secretary.
</P>
<P>
   For months, the company negotiated with Interior officials. At
one time, Nowotny said it appeared that a deal might be struck. But
in recent weeks, it was clear that the terms were unacceptable to
Doe Run, Nowotny said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interior was asking us basically to concede any legal recourse
to any decision by the department,'' Nowotny said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys general in Arkansas and Missouri also had opposed
prospecting and mining in the Ozarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great victory for those who want to ensure that
these streams and forests remain pristine and protected for
generations of Missourians to come,'' said Missouri Attorney
General Jay Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   The area of the Ozark National Scenic Riverways is underlain in
karst, a porous web of rock that allows water to bubble up from the
ground in spots and seep below in others.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such geologic conditions, Doe Run had maintained that it
could prevent any mining pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials, however, could not say whether the battle
over lead mining in the Ozarks is finally over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't answer that,'' Nowotny said, ``because I don't know
what anyone else might do. Federal law still exists that opens that
forest to multiple use.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowotny said the company would continue to look at mining
options elsewhere. Just a few weeks ago, Doe Run purchased a copper
mine in Peru.

BLUE SUSPENDED FOR ONE GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Cal State Northridge football offices are on
the North Campus, but the land gap between them and the main campus
didn't isolate the Matadors from controversy Wednesday _ not by a
long shot.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN coach Ron Ponciano said he suspended senior running back
Melvin Blue for Saturday's game at Weber State for a violation of
team rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll come back Sunday with a clean slate,'' Ponciano said.
``No one is happy about the decision, but unfortunately you have to
do something.''
</P>
<P>
   The suspension stems from an incident at the end of Tuesday's
practice in which Blue and running backs coach Keith Borges were
involved in a discussion on the field. Borges vociferously told
Blue that he didn't want to hear anything else from Blue and told
him to go to the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the major issue,'' said Ponciano, who told the
Matadors prior to practice. ``We probably had one of our best
practices we've had. It was just one guy. All I know is we had a
great practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue couldn't be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   A 6-foot, 230-pound tailback, Blue came to CSUN via Utah State
during the offseason. He spoke about running for 3,000 yards before
the season but lost his starting spot to Jaumal Bradley two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   However, Blue leads CSUN in rushing with 462 yards and also has
seven of the Matadors' eight rushing touchdowns. Despite the
lackluster numbers, Blue is considered an NFL prospect as a
fullback. On numerous occasions he talked about not complaining in
the media because that turns off scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano said Bradley and senior Geoff Snowden will share the
tailback duties at Weber State. The suspension comes as the
Matadors prepare for a game that could keep their season alive. A
win against the Wildcats would allow CSUN (4-3, 3-2 Big Sky) to
remain in the conference hunt.
</P>
<P>
   __ Top-rated defense: The past three games, CSUN's offense has
sputtered in the first half, scoring two touchdowns and 23 points.
And this week the Matadors go against the Big Sky's top defense.
</P>
<P>
   No. 23 Weber State leads the conference in rush defense, pass
defense, total defense and scoring defense, allowing 15.5 points
per game. Yet, Weber State coach Jerry Graybeal shutters at the
thought of stopping CSUN quarterback Marcus Brady.
</P>
<P>
   ``He throws the ball on time and that's big for a freshman to
do,'' Graybeal said. ``We have to try to keep him fairly contained.
I've been impressed with his arm accuracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a lackluster 16 of 33 with three interceptions last week
in a loss to Montana State, Brady is 12th in the nation in passing
efficiency with a 149.56 rating. However, that's only good for
third in the conference.

CARDINALS JUST CAN'T GET IT RIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the hazard lights on and the wheels starting to clank, the
Cardinals pulled up to the intersection of Vision and Indecision.
</P>
<P>
   They took the wrong turn.
</P>
<P>
   And now I get it.
</P>
<P>
   All the jokes. All the misfortune attributed to some cockamamie
curse. All the ineptness conveniently laid at the feet of a
mercurial owner.
</P>
<P>
   If this franchise were a cartoon, it would be Charlie Brown
attempting a field goal. Except time would expire before Lucy could
pull the ball out from under his feet.
</P>
<P>
   So Eric Swann had his knee flushed on Wednesday and will be gone
for four weeks. Rashod Swinger is now the running punch line in
Detroit, about to meet the Human Groin Pull. A first-round draft
pick named Tommy Knight will be watching Herman Moore and Johnnie
Morton from the sidelines. And eight weeks into the season, in what
should've been the year of rebellion, another crisis game beckons
and the familiar odor of collapse is drifting this way.
</P>
<P>
   Vince Tobin was asked about the Swann ordeal Tuesday, and
whether he meant to or not, Mr. Beige said it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``You make determinations as you go, and you make decisions when
you're forced to make decisions,'' Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. You plan, you plot, you scheme. You look ahead and
realize that today's tonic might be tomorrow's poison. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Action or reaction? &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Giants used their week off to send Danny Kannell to the doctor.
Same with the Bears and Erik Kramer, who also needed surgery. Bill
Parcells stormed out of practice, inciting a two-game winning
streak.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it's as simple as the difference between proactive
and reactive. And from Andre Wadsworth's contract to Rob Moore's
hamstring, from the five seconds that slipped away against the
Raiders to Eric Swann's arthritic knee, it is the reason why the
Cardinals are, well, the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Moore, we know he wanted a week off to cure his
screaming hamstring while Tobin wanted to nurse him through the bye
week. Moore obliged, but an excellent receiver became a decoy for
four weeks. Only now is he ready to stretch the defense.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Swann, no one's talking. Not even the team
doctor. But we do know that on Oct. 8, three days before a game
against the Bears, the notion of surgery came to light.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Swann remembered past criticism attached to his work
ethic. Maybe he felt peer pressure to stay in the lineup. Maybe a
$25 million deal signed in the off-season swayed his decision.
Maybe he simply tried to be a hero. &QL; 
 &QL; 
More indecision &QL; 
 &QL; 
Or maybe (wink-wink) pressure came from the coaching staff. Men who
have seen bad starts mutate into horrific seasons once too often.
Men who envisioned a 4-3 record entering the bye week. Men who have
their own backsides on the line.
</P>
<P>
   For whatever reason, they decided to wait. Even though they knew
Swann's condition could not improve with activity, no matter how
many practices he skipped. Even though they knew the knee could
give out somewhere down the line, maybe in December with the
postseason on the line. Even though proactive surgery might have
meant two more games with Swann in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vince Tobin didn't tell him what to do, one way or another,''
one staffer insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly. And indecision kills.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, all is not lost. If the Cardinals can exit November at
6-6, the schedule turns to oatmeal. They will emerge from the storm
and find the playoffs popping up in the binoculars. There is still
a chance that this team will break free of its past.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe they'll leave Michigan at 3-5 with an anchor, showing
the first symptoms of the annual Swann dive.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Beige _ a man who once contemplated a career in the
priesthood before a clipboard called his name _ should load up on
the Hail Marys.
</P>
<P>
   And if he really wants to be proactive, brushing up the resume
couldn't hurt. &QL;

GLENN'S TRIP IMPORTANT, BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT TO LEARN ABOUT
AGING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN BAVLEY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Glenn already is a shining example of what scientists have
learned about aging gracefully.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the U.S. senator and former astronaut, who blasts off
Thursday on a nine-day mission in the space shuttle Discovery,
could become one of their most important research subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have been shattering myths about the declining
capabilities of aging people. They've shown that many infirmities
of age can be delayed or even reversed by staying active.
</P>
<P>
   While Glenn's shuttle trip, to some, is more symbolic than
scientific, scientists hope it will lead to further space research
on how and why people age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why send a 77-year-old man into space?'' asked Robert Luchi of
the Huffington Center on Aging at Baylor College of Medicine in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a man who's done all the right things. He's exercised,
watched his diet, his salt intake, not had too much to drink. He
could be an object lesson for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Aging research done in space may prove valuable, Luchi and
others say, because many of the physical changes that astronauts
experience in the near-weightless environment of Earth orbit
resemble a speeded-up version of the aging process.
</P>
<P>
   In astronauts, as in the elderly, muscles atrophy, bones weaken,
sleep becomes difficult, balance grows precarious. Instead of
taking decades to develop, however, these changes occur in days or
weeks. The changes are quickly reversed once astronauts return to
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   By studying an aging astronaut such as Glenn _ whose
history-making Earth orbit occurred 36 years ago _ scientists may
be able to better compare the effects of aging to the way the body
changes in space flight.
</P>
<P>
   For example, studying why the bones of astronauts waste away and
then regain strength may help prevent or control the bone
deterioration of osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may give us some critical insight into why bone
production is turned off in aging,'' Luchi said. ``We know in space
it's turned off. What are the biochemical mechanisms that pull the
switch? If we knew, we might be able to turn it on.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn will take part in 10 experiments before, during and after
the shuttle flight to examine the debilitating physical changes
that astronauts undergo in space.
</P>
<P>
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration had planned to
do these experiments long before Glenn signed on for the mission,
so they weren't designed as studies on aging.
</P>
<P>
   Data on Glenn, however, will be examined to see whether space
flight affects him more than it does his crewmates, and whether he
takes longer to recover.
</P>
<P>
   While the limited data on Glenn from this flight won't supply
any immediate answers about aging, it may help scientists ask the
right questions in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an opening,'' said Andrew Monjan, the National Institute
on Aging's liaison with NASA. ``Sort of one small step for aging.
One giant leap for research.''
Application on Earth
</P>
<P>
   NASA officials say it's conceivable that the research conducted
on Glenn's shuttle mission may lead to practical benefits for the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of this research is to develop countermeasures to
protect astronauts from the disabilities caused by space flight,
said David Liskowsky, a NASA scientist overseeing the experiments
on Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   These measures may include drugs, exercise, training programs or
medical devices. Potentially, they may be adapted to help the
elderly, Liskowsky said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very excited. We're hoping that by doing this research,
there will be applications on Earth,'' he said. ``Maybe they could
be helpful as therapies as people grow older.''
</P>
<P>
   Earthbound scientists already have learned a considerable amount
about the aging process, and much of it is heartening, even for
those who haven't optimally aged like Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is, an awful lot of what we thought was aging is
just inactivity,'' said Stephanie Studenski, director of the Center
on Aging at the University of Kansas Medical Center. ``A good deal
of health and fitness can be gained by older people by remaining
active.''
</P>
<P>
   Muscle weakness, poor balance, limited ability to move joints,
low aerobic capacity _ all once considered inevitable consequences
of aging _ are potentially reversible through exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Landmark studies have shown that people in their 90s can pump
iron and double their strength.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have put men and women in their 70s through
45-minute sessions of high-intensity aerobics. The exercises not
only did not cause harm but improved the participants' physical
conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   Other elderly subjects have gone through 15-week courses in the
Chinese martial art of Tai Chi. Balance improved, so they were less
likely to fall and less afraid of falling.
</P>
<P>
   Elderly people with newly diagnosed diabetes improved their
condition significantly after 50-minute workouts on stationary
bicycles four days a week.
</P>
<P>
   And in a study underway at KU's School of Nursing, researchers
are finding that middle-age and elderly people with rheumatoid
arthritis can walk faster, grip tighter and increase their lung
capacity with regular aerobic exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it always surprises them that there are exercises they
can do without aggravating their arthritis,'' said Geri Neuberger,
the nursing school professor conducting the study.
</P>
<P>
   While peak performance inevitably declines with age, healthy
older people can participate in the same kind of fitness programs
as younger adults, Studenski said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marathons aren't won by people over 40, but there are people
still running marathons in their 80s,'' she said.
Staying fit
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-year-old David Christie of Lenexa, a patient of
Studenski's, isn't running any races, but he still keeps fit
lifting hand weights and exercising on a stationary bicycle in his
living room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is to get going,'' Christie said. ``Old people need
to keep busy and interested in something.''
</P>
<P>
   Christie has been exercising since he was a young man. But as
the myths of aging are debunked, many elderly people are taking up
exercise for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have never exercised in their life. I get a thrill
when they say `I feel so much better,' &UR; '' said Annie Bailey,
fitness instructor at John Knox Village, a retirement community in
Lee's Summit. ``These people are motivated to go regardless of the
aches and pains.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Glenn is in top condition, NASA went to great pains
to make sure he wouldn't run into trouble on the shuttle, Luchi of
Baylor said.
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, NASA asked Luchi and several other physician
experts on aging for insights into potential risks to a 70-year-old
astronaut.
</P>
<P>
   They advised the space agency about the potential for bone and
muscle loss, of possible changes in heart function _ even the
chance of brain hemorrhage.
</P>
<P>
   The brain tends to shrink with age, which could put more tension
on blood vessels, Luchi's team said. They reasoned that these
vessels might break if subjected to the high G-forces and vibration
of takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   NASA took their recommendation that Glenn get a preflight brain
scan. It showed Glenn would be safe.
</P>
<P>
   Monjan said Glenn is in optimal physical condition for his age.
``Average 77-year-olds would probably not be able to go into
space,'' he said. ``They would be disqualified by medical
conditions such as arthritis, osteoporosis or heart disease.''
</P>
<P>
   NASA hasn't scheduled any other elderly astronauts for space
flight. In the immediate future, the agency's aging experiments
most likely will be conducted on animals and cell cultures.
</P>
<P>
   But when the international space station is operational early in
the next century, many scientists hope astronauts in their 50s, 60s
or even 70s will be included in the crew and used as research
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's bound to happen,'' predicted Ron White, associate
director of the National Space Biomedical Research Institute, a
consortium of seven university space research programs. ``The real
gold up there is longer-term exposure with a subject you can follow
for weeks and months. You can see how the body remolds itself.''
</P>
<P>
   If NASA decides to send more elderly astronauts into space,
White said there's a group of willing and experienced candidates:
the Skylab astronauts of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have talked about sending them back up, but that's only
been informal,'' White said. ``Those characters would volunteer in
a minute to go into space.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Christie, the closest thing to space flight he wants to
experience is watching John Glenn on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, I'd rather keep my feet on the ground,'' he said.

TOMEY CASTS VOTE AGAINST PLAYOFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ It's appropriate, perhaps, that Arizona is ranked in
the first Bowl Championship Series poll.
</P>
<P>
   Wildcats Coach Dick Tomey is a member of the NCAA's Football
Issues Group, which in large part was responsible for devising the
rating.
</P>
<P>
   But Tomey, unlike some, does not think the BCS rating is the
initial step toward the creation of a full-fledged,
basketball-style tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a better way than we've had of determining a
champion, but you can't have a tournament in football,'' said
Tomey, whose Wildcats will test their No. 14 BCS rating against No.
11 Oregon on Saturday at Arizona Stadium. ``The games are too
physically demanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the wrong time of the year. It's the end of the first
semester and start of the second. Guys can't miss class then.''
</P>
<P>
   But in 1993, Tomey probably would have enjoyed a tournament-like
playoff. That's when his Wildcats were on a roll with a late-season
flourish for a 10-2 record and a victory over Miami in the Fiesta
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who would like to have an eight-team
tournament, or four-team tournament or whatever,'' he said. ``In
1993, I think we would have won it. I just felt that at the Fiesta
Bowl, if we had played anybody, we could have beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   In what might be a good sign, the Wildcats are 7-1 for the first
time since 1993. Oregon was their ninth opponent that year, as it
is this year.
</P>
<P>
   The 1993 result at Arizona Stadium:
</P>
<P>
   Wildcats 31, Ducks 10. &QL;  &QL; 
A contender &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Athletic Director Jim Livengood is indeed thinking about a
new contract for Tomey, here's something else to consider:
</P>
<P>
   Tomey, who is the in final year of his deal, is among 10
nominees for the Eddie Robinson Coach the Year award, which is
sponsored by the Football Writers Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   Tomey will match wits Saturday with another nominee, Oregon's
Mike Bellotti.
</P>
<P>
   The other eight: Former Arizona Coach Larry Smith of Missouri,
George O'Leary of Georgia Tech, Phillip Fulmer of Tennessee, Bob
Toledo of UCLA, Houston Nutt of Arkansas, Barry Alvarez of
Wisconsin, Bill Snyder of Kansas State and Tommy Bowden of Tulane.
</P>
<P>
   The winner will be announced Dec. 10. The presentation will be
made Jan. 4 in Tempe. &QL;  &QL; 
Briefly &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The numbers: A narrow point spread that favors the Wildcats by
1{ is a good reflection of the Oregon-Arizona series. The Ducks
hold a one-game advantage, 12-11. But it hasn't been that close
during the past four years when the Ducks have gone 4-0. At Arizona
Stadium, the Wildcats are 7-4.
</P>
<P>
   A surprising statistic: Over the past four years, Oregon leads
the Pac-10 in total victories with a 37-18 record.
</P>
<P>
   Wildcats quarterback Keith Smith was one of five nominees for
Pac-10 Offensive Player of the Week. The honor went to Oregon State
quarterback Jonathan Smith. Cornerback Chris McAlister earned a
special teams nomination with his 68-yard punt return for a
touchdown against Northeast Louisiana. California punter Nick
Harris, a sophomore from Avondale, won it. &QL;  &QL;

UCLA'S CRITICS TAKE THEIR SHOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the polls scream ``success story,'' the opponents shout
``fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoa. Are we talking politics or college football?
</P>
<P>
   UCLA received the top ranking in the bowl poll Monday despite a
steady stream of criticism from past and future opponents this
season. Bashing the Bruins (6-0) is downright trendy.
</P>
<P>
   California wide receiver Dameane Douglas, who caught 10 passes
for 73 yards in UCLA's 28-16 victory Saturday, is the latest to
jump on the bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're definitely not the Number 2 team,'' he said about the
Bruins' ranking in the Associated Press and coaches' polls. ``Maybe
Number 27 or 28, but not Number 2.''
</P>
<P>
   It started with Texas running back Ricky Williams, who called
the Longhorns' next opponent, Kansas State, tougher.
</P>
<P>
   Next came Houston Coach Kim Helton, who said the same about his
team's follow-up opponent, Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Let's not forget Southern California Coach Paul Hackett, who
watched UCLA beat Oregon and then called the Ducks the team to beat
in the Pac-10. The Trojans had faced neither team yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable to me, it really is,'' UCLA Coach Bob Toledo
said. ``I don't want to get into a contest. It's like when you get
into contests with skunks. You lose the battle, right?''
</P>
<P>
   The perception seems to be that UCLA isn't blowing out more
opponents. Its past two victories were by a combined 15 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people think we (stink) all the way up to the Fiesta Bowl,
that's fine with me,'' UCLA tackle Kris Farris told the Los Angeles
Times. ``As long as we get there.'' &QL;  &QL; 
Around the Pac
</P>
<P>
   Despite the game falling on Halloween, and kickoff time having
changed several times, Arizona fans should be ashamed if they don't
fill up 57,803-seat Arizona Stadium for Saturday's game between No.
12 Oregon and the No. 13 Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona is one of the conference's most entertaining teams. As
of Wednesday, approximately 39,000 tickets had been sold.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows how it will affect Cade McNown's Heisman campaign, but
UCLA doesn't seem bothered by Sports Illustrated's decision to run
a large color shot of the quarterback losing his lunch (and
breakfast and dinner, apparently) against Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grabbed it and took it into the quarterback meeting,''
Toledo said. ``I took it into every meeting. The kids were
laughing. It's funny, but it's not funny. It's a lot of exposure,
but I don't know if it's good exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington may give backup quarterback Marques Tuiasosopo a look
at tailback, which is not exactly an outrageous proposition if you
consider he's the Huskies' leading rusher this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll definitely consider it,'' Coach Jim Lambright said.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon junior Nathan Villegas has made 11 of 11 field goals this
season, including his longest of 49 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Five Pac-10 teams, including Arizona and ASU, have hit fewer
than half of their attempts. The Wildcats are the worst with a
3-for-10 effort.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors continue to fly that Washington State Coach Mike Price
will head to the NFL's San Diego Chargers as an assistant to help
his troubled former quarterback, Ryan Leaf.
</P>
<P>
   Price's contract recently was extended to the 2005 season for
more than $400,000 per year. Cougars Athletic Director Rick Dickson
said the Chargers haven't asked to talk to Price.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't really make any sense, does it?'' he said.
``College head coaches hardly ever leave to take NFL assistant
jobs.'' &QL;  &QL;

BLUE SUSPENDED FOR ONE GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Cal State Northridge football offices are on
the North Campus, but the land gap between them and the main campus
didn't isolate the Matadors from controversy Wednesday _ not by a
long shot.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN coach Ron Ponciano said he suspended senior running back
Melvin Blue for Saturday's game at Weber State for a violation of
team rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll come back Sunday with a clean slate,'' Ponciano said.
``No one is happy about the decision, but unfortunately you have to
do something.''
</P>
<P>
   The suspension stems from an incident at the end of Tuesday's
practice in which Blue and running backs coach Keith Borges were
involved in a discussion on the field. Borges vociferously told
Blue that he didn't want to hear anything else from Blue and told
him to go to the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the major issue,'' said Ponciano, who told the
Matadors prior to practice. ``We probably had one of our best
practices we've had. It was just one guy. All I know is we had a
great practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue couldn't be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   A 6-foot, 230-pound tailback, Blue came to CSUN via Utah State
during the offseason. He spoke about running for 3,000 yards before
the season but lost his starting spot to Jaumal Bradley two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   However, Blue leads CSUN in rushing with 462 yards and also has
seven of the Matadors' eight rushing touchdowns. Despite the
lackluster numbers, Blue is considered an NFL prospect as a
fullback. On numerous occasions he talked about not complaining in
the media because that turns off scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano said Bradley and senior Geoff Snowden will share the
tailback duties at Weber State. The suspension comes as the
Matadors prepare for a game that could keep their season alive. A
win against the Wildcats would allow CSUN (4-3, 3-2 Big Sky) to
remain in the conference hunt.
</P>
<P>
   __ Top-rated defense: The past three games, CSUN's offense has
sputtered in the first half, scoring two touchdowns and 23 points.
And this week the Matadors go against the Big Sky's top defense.
</P>
<P>
   No. 23 Weber State leads the conference in rush defense, pass
defense, total defense and scoring defense, allowing 15.5 points
per game. Yet, Weber State coach Jerry Graybeal shutters at the
thought of stopping CSUN quarterback Marcus Brady.
</P>
<P>
   ``He throws the ball on time and that's big for a freshman to
do,'' Graybeal said. ``We have to try to keep him fairly contained.
I've been impressed with his arm accuracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a lackluster 16 of 33 with three interceptions last week
in a loss to Montana State, Brady is 12th in the nation in passing
efficiency with a 149.56 rating. However, that's only good for
third in the conference.

REDMOND: `I'LL BE READY' FOR COUGARS 
</HEADLINE>
 STATE-NOTES-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arizona State tailback J.R. Redmond practiced Wednesday for the
first time in a week and said he expects to play Saturday at
Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be ready to go,'' Redmond said. ``I still have a few more
days to heal.''
</P>
<P>
   Redmond aggravated a toe injury and suffered a sprained ankle
against Stanford last Thursday. He worked out sparingly on his own
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ASU Coach Bruce Snyder wasn't ready to declare Redmond ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't taken the ball yet on one snap,'' he said. ``He
hasn't caught a pass. If he's ready, it will probably be (decided)
Saturday morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Also practicing Wednesday was offensive lineman Randy Leaphart,
who has been sidelined much of the season because of a knee
injury. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Shortage in secondary &QL; 
 &QL; 
A shortage of available defensive backs has Snyder scrambling for
options.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually every player on our secondary has something
physically wrong with them,'' Snyder said. ``We're beat up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils have opted to keep Redmond out of the safety mix
this season because of the toll playing offense and special teams
has taken on his body.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder said he hopes to avoid using any redshirt candidates, but
if he must, Brandon Falkner is the likely choice for a spot in the
secondary, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder is considering turning to an offensive player who plays
sparingly. That could be freshman Justin Taplin, who was a standout
safety at Tempe High School in addition to playing wide receiver.
He had five interceptions as a senior.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents have caught on to ASU's secondary shortcomings and
have tried to capitalize.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is working on a match-up, getting good guys on guys
that do not cover as well,'' Snyder said. ``We need to be better.
We need to coach better, we need to prepare them better, they need
to go up sooner. It has to make more sense to them.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU's pass defense ranks seventh in the Pac-10 and has allowed a
league-leading 13 touchdowns. It also has managed only three
interceptions, which ties with Washington for last. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quick hits &QL; 
 &QL; 
The forecast for Saturday's game calls for a high of 53 degrees
with a chance of rain.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 22 high school players Washington State signed in 1994,
only six remain on the roster, according to the Tacoma News
Tribune. Some left early for the NFL, such as quarterback Ryan
Leaf, or graduated, but 13 didn't cut it on the field or in the
classroom.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils have lost their past two games in Pullman and are
4-5 overall there. &QL;

BATES, PITTMAN DON SANDERS MASK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mario Bates and Michael Pittman won't have to rummage through a
costume store this week. The backup running backs get to be Barry
Sanders for Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   It's such a big job that it takes both of them to impersonate
Sanders, the Detroit Lions' career rushing leader, in practice as
the Cardinals prepare to play the Lions on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they are doing a good job,'' Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin
said. ``I might tell them to do that in the game, to act like
they're Barry Sanders. They've done an excellent job, jumping in
the hole, jumping backward and sideways and spinning, all that type
of thing. We've got as good a look as you can get.''
</P>
<P>
   Bates said it's a big enough job simply being himself this week.
Bates could get his second straight start because Adrian Murrell
has not recovered fully from a calf strain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to do both this week, be me and Barry,'' Bates
said. ``Unfortunately, Adrian has been a little slow recovering.
They've got me back there again. It's an opportunity for me and
Michael to step up this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael and I are also trying to give our defense a good look
as Barry, trying to emulate what he does with the same kind of
moves, trying to hit the hole faster. He's a speed guy. He sets up
his blocks. Barry just runs like a chicken with its head cut off.
You never know which way he's going to go. You have to catch that
chicken quick or he's gone. He's a heck of a guy and a heck of a
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Bates can't match Sanders' 14,543 career rushing yards, but
Bates was the New Orleans Saints' leading rusher during his first
three NFL seasons. Bates is coming off a 45-yard outing in 13
carries against the New York Giants. He was especially effective on
first down, which Tobin said earned him more playing time
regardless of Murrell's status.
</P>
<P>
   Murrell, meanwhile, did little in practice Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know at this point if he'll be ready Sunday,'' Tobin
said. ``I would have hoped Adrian could have done more in
practice.'' &QL;  &QL; 
Making progress &QL;  &QL; 
Rookie offensive tackle Anthony Clement, who was pushing for a
starting spot before having surgery on a herniated disc Sept. 19,
has begun to ride a stationary bicycle and do light exercises. He
resumed attending team meetings last week.
</P>
<P>
   He was projected to return for the 10th or 12th game, which
would be another month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it will be that long,'' said Clement, at 6 feet
7 and 355 pounds the largest player the team ever has drafted. ``I
think maybe two more weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether medical personnel are as
optimistic. &QL;  &QL; 
The plane truth &QL;  &QL; 
Mike Moten was about to buckle into his seat for the charter flight
to Dallas for the season opener when he got a tap on the shoulder
from Tobin. Moten was off the plane and waived to make room for
holdout first-round draft pick Andre Wadsworth, who had just
signed.
</P>
<P>
   With tackle Eric Swann having knee surgery Wednesday, Moten was
re-signed to the practice squad for depth.
</P>
<P>
   For the past seven weeks, Moten has been home in Florida working
out in hopes of getting another chance, and working part-time at
his church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was making a few dollars, but not like here,'' said Moten, a
6-5, 266-pound undrafted rookie tackle from Florida. ``It was fun
to go back home for a while, but it's more fun to get back here. I
had a job interview set up for Wednesday. I was back on campus at
Florida on Tuesday to revise my resume. My pager went off and it
was my agent (Kyle Rote Jr.) telling me the Cardinals wanted to
sign me back and fly me out at 7 that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty shocking at first the way it ended last time on
the airplane and everything. But I was happy the deal all came
together for Andre. I even watched that Dallas game and was rooting
for Andre to do good.'' &QL;  &QL;

ONE ROUTE AT A TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Let us get this straight. The UCLA football team
is undefeated and ranked No. 1 in the poll that matters, but the
Bruins would sooner call themselves gutty than suggest they're
Fiesta Bowl-bound.
</P>
<P>
   The USC football team, on the other hand, has two Pacific-10
losses and its coach continues to speak of the Trojans in the same
breath as the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the farther away you are from a goal, the easier it
is to see it.
</P>
<P>
   A celestial season is built the same way as a sturdy chimney:
one brick at a time. Anyone who suggests otherwise is simply
blowing smoke. You pile 16 wins one on top of the other, as the
Bruins have, by looking nary one play ahead much less one month.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans have a blue-ribbon blueprint. Now what they really
could use are blinders. If they're going to add on to their regular
season, they're going to have to do it one nail at a time, starting
Saturday at the Coliseum against Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to R. Jay Soward, the Trojans' human hammer.
He's so versatile, he can pound opponents with his acrobatic
catches or pummel them with his kickoff and punt returns. He is
averaging 16.6 yards a reception, 35.6 yards a punt return, 62.3
yards a kickoff return, 14.6 yards a run and a touchdown every 5.9
times he touches the football.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Soward has the speed to make secondaries look silly.
He has the panache to launch a thousand bouquets. He does so many
spectacular things, people seem quick to forgive him his lapses.
</P>
<P>
   We're not speaking here of Soward's indifference to his studies,
which caused first-year coach Paul Hackett to suspend the junior
for the season-opener against Purdue. Soward showed he can be a
conscientious student when prodded, pulling a 3.0 grade-point
average (out of 4.0) in his summer-school classes.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge now before him is to transfer that earnestness to
the field, where he has been known to mix in a slipshod route every
now and again.
</P>
<P>
   It happened last weekend at Oregon, late in the third quarter of
a 10-10 game. Soward sleepwalked through a post corner route while
in the backfield freshman quarterback Carson Palmer was scrambling
for his life.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Soward wasn't the primary receiver on the play, which
ended with Palmer peeling himself off the ground after being
sacked. But he might have ended up with the football anyway had he
hustled to find a seam, any seam.
</P>
<P>
   At best, Soward could have bailed out a teammate far more
inexperienced than he. If nothing else, by running the route as if
it were his last Soward would have edged his defender ever closer
to exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   The play probably would have been forgotten if the Trojans had
pulled out the game. But in the wake of their 17-13 loss to the
Ducks, it's hard not to wonder: If a team's most talented player
slips into second gear, if only for one down, what message does
that send to the others?
</P>
<P>
   How can a team be expected to run on all cylinders if each part
isn't?
</P>
<P>
   Soward is smart enough to know his every step is being studied.
He was the one who targeted his route-running before the season,
saying, it hadn't been ``very crisp or exact'' during the Trojans'
6-5 campaign of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a grown man,'' he went on to explain, ``and people on the
team are looking to how I play.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward would do well to check out how Larry Parker,
reconstructed foot and all, consistently backtracks to help a
quarterback in distress.
</P>
<P>
   He should observe how classmate Chris Claiborne tackles losses,
unfailingly owning up to his mistakes lest the blame weighs heavily
on the shoulders of another.
</P>
<P>
   Soward leads the team in highlight-reel plays. But that's not
the same thing as leading the team.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Soward simply feels like the reins are out of his reach at
this point.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say for sure because he hasn't felt up to speaking
to reporters this week. The facts are these: Against Oregon, his
contributions boiled down to one kickoff return and three
receptions totaling nine yards. Seven other passes were thrown in
Soward's general direction but only two in the final 25 minutes,
when the game was anybody's for the grabbing.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans have to hope all Soward needs to stay sharp are a
few more catchable balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``R. Jay has done a good job of running routes for the most
part,'' Hackett said. ``Our problem with R. Jay right now is that
we don't give him a chance enough of the time. If we throw the ball
down the field and he doesn't have the opportunity to go catch it,
the quarterbacks have not done their job. We have to do a better
job of getting the ball into his area.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't figure to be easy against the Huskies, who lead the
conference in sacks after collecting 31 in their past three games
alone. But as long as Soward has the will, there's gotta be a way.

BAIL BONDSMEN, SOONERS PLEAD FOR SWITZER'S RETURN

<TEXT>
<P>
   In his spare time at Valley Ranch, which was most of the time,
Coach Gunsmoke could often be heard telling his OU war stories.
</P>
<P>
   As football history does note, Gunsmoke ruled a vast Oklahoma
empire, until in his own words, ``the dopin', shootin', rapin'''
started.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just the police who showed up at the jock dorm door.
Under Gunsmoke's watch, his football program was presented the
Alphabet Soup National Law Enforcement Award. At one time or
another, the DEA, ATF, FBI, and, of course, the NCAA were involved
in some sort of investigation involving an OU player or coaching
staff member.
</P>
<P>
   But when Gunsmoke was removed from his throne in 1988, was it in
disgrace? Why certainly not, at least among a vast majority of OU
loyalists.
</P>
<P>
   All that mattered then, and all that matters now, is the
winning. Of no concern is how you win, or if the football program
brought national disgrace to the university _ just win, bay-bee.
And the Sooners did, and did, and did, almost right until the end
came for The Smokester.
</P>
<P>
   Then the winning slowed for the Boomers, and now the winning is
almost nonexistent under Gunsmoke's handpicked head coach, the very
unfortunate John Blake.
</P>
<P>
   The cattle are currently restless in Oklahoma. Sweeping the herd
like an outbreak of anthrax is a ``bring-back-Gunsmoke'' disease.
</P>
<P>
   And they would if they could, meaning if Gunsmoke would agree.
He says he won't. He says he couldn't coach under today's tight
NCAA rules, which is about as good an answer as Gunsmoke has ever
had on anything. But the disease won't go away.
</P>
<P>
   Head coaching at this level, or any level, has placed Blake in
way over his head, but Gunsmoke's pal is left twisting in the
Oklahoma wind. When Blake is fired after this season, there are
those who actually believe Gunsmoke will reconsider and return to
his OU throne.
</P>
<P>
   So it goes in the college game, where a football version of
``Fatal Attraction'' plays in many areas. Image and class are
measured strictly by W's.
</P>
<P>
   At Clemson, for instance, the masses want back Danny Ford. Now.
In Arkansas, they are still trying to figure out why Frank Broyles
hired Ford. But the answer is simple. Broyles was an AD desperate
to win at any cost.
</P>
<P>
   At Auburn, one name on the list of coaching candidates is Larry
Blakeney of Troy State. That's the same Blakeney, who as an
assistant coach at Auburn in the early '90s, was directly linked to
recruiting violations that cost the school two years of NCAA
probation.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a time at Texas A&AMP;M when a large segment of the
fandom openly adored Jackie Sherrill, even several years after he
was asked to depart College Station. The embarrassment to the
school that had come with Sherrill's football program was treated
as a minor inconvenience by many fans. It was Sherrill, after all,
who started the current winning era for the Aggies.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the early '90s, Bob Toledo was R.C. Slocum's offensive
coordinator. Toledo is much better known these days as the UCLA
head coach, and his firing at A&AMP;M was Slocum's worst mistake.
Which, by the way, Slocum admits.
</P>
<P>
   But anyway, in a campus conversation with several sportswriters
one day, Toledo was asking for opinions on the Aggies' eventual
opponent in the Cotton Bowl. A Southwest Conference title had been
wrapped up and Toledo was sorting through the list of possible
matchups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't rule out Mississippi State,'' said a writer, causing
Toledo to frown.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Bob,'' added the writer, ``with Jackie Sherrill against
you guys, it wouldn't matter if Mississippi State sold one ticket.
The Aggies would buy all 72,000 seats.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo paused, and then replied, ``Yeah, but who would they be
cheering for?''
</P>
<P>
   A very valid question. And it wasn't that many years ago when
the answer was still open for debate in College Station.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Paterno once made his famous statement about holding off
retirement at Penn State because he didn't care to ``leave college
football to the Switzers and the Sherrills.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Joe prepared to work until he's 100?
</P>
<P>
   Sherrill is entrenched at Mississippi State, although he hasn't
made a national splash in a long while. And now there's the very
real possibility that Gunsmoke, at age 61, could return to OU.
</P>
<P>
   That would make the Oklahoma fans very happy. But not nearly as
overjoyed as every bail bondsman within a 50-mile radius of Norman.

L.A. COUNTY SHERIFF MAY LOSE SIGHT, SPEECH AFTER BRAIN SURGERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE CONDON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Neurology experts said the type of brain surgery
performed on Sheriff Sherman Block could lead to paralysis or loss
of the ability to speak, walk and see, depending on the location of
the blood clot that was removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wide range of outcomes. It's contingent on where the
clot was,'' said Dr. Gary Heit, an assistant professor of
neurosurgery at Stanford University Medical Center who has
performed the surgery many times.
</P>
<P>
   Block, who is running for re-election against Lee Baca, remained
in serious condition Wednesday at USC University Hospital with no
significant change, the hospital said in a statement. The sheriff
ended up in the hospital Saturday after a blood clot caused him to
fall and cut his head, requiring 10 stitches.
</P>
<P>
   The surgical procedure performed Monday on Block, Heit said, is
used to treat an otherwise fatal condition caused when blood leaks
into the center portion of the brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably means it's not in a favorable area,'' he said.
``It suggests it's close to the brain stem or deep in cerebral
matter. Patients with deep clots generally don't do well.''
</P>
<P>
   Little information about Block's condition has been forthcoming
from his physician, Dr. Srinath Samudrala; officials at USC
University Hospital; the Sheriff's Department; or his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Samudrala has said only that Block had a blood clot deep inside
his brain and that his level of alertness has continued to improve.
He and others declined to say whether the sheriff is conscious or
can speak.
</P>
<P>
   USC University Hospital spokeswoman Brenda Maceo said Block
underwent a right front craniotomy, interhemispheric approach
evacuation of hematoma. Neurological experts said that means
surgeons entered Block's brain on the right side to remove a blood
clot inside the brain near where its &UR;  &LR; left and right sides meet.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors agreed the side effects could be loss of the ability
to speak, walk and see.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Vespa, an assistant professor of neurology at UCLA
Medical School, said the biggest danger with this type of hematoma
is paralysis and that less than half of those who have had the
surgery can go back to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It typically causes enough disability (that) they can't
perform their job,'' Vespa said.
</P>
<P>
   All patients with such blood clots suffer some damage, he added,
noting: ``The hemorrhage itself causes some degree of brain damage.
Depending on the brain damage, he may or may not have certain
neurological problems. Most people have some degree of neurological
deficit afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   Vespa said it would take about three months for anyone to return
to work after such surgery, saying it is likely that Block will
have to go to a rehabilitation hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Heit said the fact that Block is under treatment for kidney
failure could complicate his recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``People with renal failure have trouble recovering from these
incidents,'' he said. ``They tend to bleed easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Scott, Block's campaign consultant, said the sheriff's
family is coordinating the release of information about his
condition.
</P>
<P>
   While the neurologists speaking about Block all may be highly
regarded professionals, Scott said only Samudrala is an expert on
this particular case because Block is his patient.
</P>
<P>
   Block had insisted throughout the campaign that despite two
bouts with cancer and his thrice-weekly dialysis treatments for
kidney failure, he was healthy enough to lead the department for
four more years. But Baca, a former regional chief for the
department, said he decided to challenge Block because he feared
that if re-elected, Block might quit midterm because of health
problems, and the Board of Supervisors, rather than the electorate,
would choose the next sheriff.

ROBERT WHITE IS DEAD AT 82; LED A UNION 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert L. White, a former mailman who was president of the
National Alliance of Postal and Federal Employees, one of the
country's oldest independent, black-led labor unions, died on
Sunday at Washington Hospital Center. He was 82 and lived in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pneumonia, the union said.
</P>
<P>
   White was elected national president in 1970 and served until
retiring in 1989. Under his leadership, membership rose to 80,000
as the union maintained close ties with other black institutions,
organizations and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The National Alliance made a $1.2 million grant to Howard
University for a labor-law clinic and a new graduate program in
labor-management relations in its School of Business. White also
oversaw the creation of a credit union, a housing program and a
health-benefit plan for retired union members.
</P>
<P>
   White, a native of Jackson, Miss., arrived in Washington in 1934
to attend Howard University on a full football scholarship. He
played football and basketball and was a member of the track team.
</P>
<P>
   He started working for the U.S. Post Office in the late 1930s
and quickly became active in the National Alliance, which was
formed in 1913 to serve black railway mail clerks and protect their
jobs. He rose through the union ranks and in 1953 was voted
president of the Washington chapter, a post he held until becoming
national president.
</P>
<P>
   White is survived by his wife of 59 years, Helen White; six
sons, Ramon, of Washington, Robert, of Omaha, Christopher, of
Japan, and William, Stephen and Mark, all of Oakland, Calif.; five
daughters, Helen Janice White-Dada and Dorothy White-Lee, both of
Washington, Roberta White-Battle and Elizabeth White, both of
Sacramento, Calif., and Mary White-Prince, of Atlanta; a sister;
two brothers, and 18 grandchildren.

OWNERS: L.A. MADE PROGRESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A day after enduring a three-hour multimedia
assault from three groups bidding for an NFL expansion franchise,
commissioner Paul Tagliabue promised Wednesday that subsequent
meetings will be held in board rooms, where financial reports and
market research will be surveyed in silence.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue, in wrapping up a two-day owners' meeting, smiled and
said, ``We're not going to have another dog-and-pony show.''
</P>
<P>
   But it appears _ particularly in the case of the two groups from
Los Angeles _ that the dog had some bite and the pony some kick.
</P>
<P>
   Several owners said Wednesday that the L.A. groups, on the
strength of their presentations, had made up considerable ground on
Houston, which has had an airtight proposal in place for months. It
might have been simple posturing to fuel competition _ a favorite
hobby of NFL owners _ but the L.A. groups can probably draw
encouragement from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there has been (progress),'' Indianapolis Colts owner
Jim Irsay said of the two proposals, one made on behalf of the
Coliseum by Kings owner Edward Roski Jr., the other for a site in
Carson by Hollywood deal-maker Michael Ovitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question Los Angeles was way, way back in the pack,
and I think they've made some ground up and moved forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver Broncos owner Pat Bowlen added, ``I think the Coliseum
proposal has come a long way from where it was a couple of years
ago. And I think the Carson proposal is very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kraft of the New England Patriots also cited vast
progress by the Coliseum group.
</P>
<P>
   What the NFL wants to see next, according to Tagliabue, are
``concrete aspects'' of financing plans, ownership groups, stadium
design and construction costs.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue, often characterized as a commissioner who never met
an issue he couldn't appoint a committee to study, duly formed a
new one to look deeper into the expansion derby.
</P>
<P>
   The new expansion committee, chaired jointly by Kraft (of the
league's finance committee) and the Carolina Panthers' Jerry
Richardson (of the stadium committee), will meet with members of
the three groups over the next 30-60 days to nail down more
specifics, Tagliabue said.
</P>
<P>
   Then the owners will convene for a special meeting in Dallas in
mid-February to discuss the expansion issue further. Then they'll
take it up again a month later in Phoenix at their regularly
scheduled winter meeting. Their timetable for selection has been
the first quarter of next year; they appear firmly on that snail's
pace.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft said the owners talked Wednesday morning ``about the
timing of the commitment, that we have to make a decision while
these programs are on the table so that we don't lose them. It's so
hard to get stadium deals.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL owners were given figures on plummeting ratings for NFL
telecasts in the Los Angeles market, the nation's second-largest.
Tagliabue noted that the region ranked ``14th or 15th'' in 1994,
the final year of the Raiders' and Rams' residency, and the ranking
was down to 29th last year.
</P>
<P>
   By giving the Los Angeles groups words of encouragement, the
league undoubtedly assured itself spirited competition between now
and the next series of meetings early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Houston at this point has its act together better
than Los Angeles,'' said the Colts' Irsay, ``but Los Angeles does
have a period of time to get its act together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Los Angeles proposals are very strong, and both
groups did a great job (with the presentations), and there are some
exciting things that they're looking at. It's just that Houston has
more certainty to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Irsay continued: ``But the decision isn't being made today, so
there's a chance for Los Angeles to get more certainty in their
proposals. The league office and the commissioner's office have to
confirm some of the projections, some of the assumptions that are
there.... L.A. needs some real rock-hard certainty on some of these
financing issues.''
</P>
<P>
   NFL officials have said these specifics include the nature and
backing of the public money Carson has vowed to provide for Ovitz's
stadium and mall project and the Coliseum's rvenue projections for
seat licenses and premium seating, which form the bedrock for the
financing of the stadium's extensive renovation.
</P>
<P>
   As the NFL draws closer to its expansion decision, it will have
to take up yet another important financial issue with the expansion
candidates: the fee for admission to the NFL's exclusive club.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue, mindful that the new Cleveland Browns paid a record
franchise fee of $476 million just a few weeks ago, said that
figure would serve as a ``starting point'' for the 32nd team. The
commissioner said the fee for the new team ``would be at that point
or higher.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL's hope is to have the expansion franchise on the field
for the 2002 season.
</P>
<P>
   After this selection is made, the losing city will be left to
court a disenchanted team looking to relocate _ not an unpleasant
prospect for the NFL owners.
</P>
<P>
   Asked when the next round of NFL expansion might occur,
Tagliabue said, ``Not in my lifetime or yours.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't smiling this time.

KINGS GET COACH'S MESSAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Line by line, the Los Angeles Kings
players had met with their coach earlier in the day. Line by line,
they'd watched the videotapes revealing what they hadn't been
doing.
</P>
<P>
   Then, line by line Wednesday night, the Kings showed they'd
learned the lesson. Twenty-four hours after a dreary loss to the
New York Islanders, they recorded their most one-sided victory of
the season, a 4-0 defeat of the New Jersey Devils before a crowd of
15,008.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being outshot 40-18, the Kings gained strength as the
night progressed, showed increased tenacity in the corners and in
pursuit of loose pucks, got the first goals of the season from
Craig Johnson, Steve Duchesne and Vladimir Tsyplakov, and got a
combined shutout from Stephane Fiset and Manny Legace.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second shutout in as many years for the Kings in New
Jersey. The Kings have outscored the Devils 11-1 in the last three
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effort that we put up in Long Island (on Tuesday) wasn't
there,'' coach Larry Robinson said after the Kings (4-3-2)
completed a 2-2-1 trip. ``I thought it was a pretty gutsy effort by
a lot of guys to come out and play against a pretty darn good team,
a much bigger team than we are down the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the shutout required two goalies was the dark spot
of the evening for the Kings, who started Fiset in goal for the
first time since he'd strained his right groin muscle 10 days
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened? Fiset strained his left groin muscle midway
through the second period and was replaced by Legace at the 13:29
mark. Trainer Peter Demers said he was unsure of the severity of
the injury. Fiset will be examined today by team physician Dr.
Ronald Kvitne.
</P>
<P>
   Before his injury, Fiset was sharp, stopping all 23 shots.
Legace then came in and stopped the last 17 shots by the Devils,
including one by Bob Carpenter on a breakaway in the third period.
After taking his shot, Carpenter crashed into Legace, then fell on
him. Legace was prone for about a minute, and it appeared he might
be replaced by Ryan Bach, who had suited up after the Fiset injury.
</P>
<P>
   But Legace only had the wind knocked out of him and remained in
the game. Proving that life as a Kings goalie is always an
adventure, a barefooted Legace slipped on the wet dressing-room
floor after the game. He also lost his catching glove during one of
the Devils' power plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going, `Please, don't shoot, I'm going to break my
hand,''' said Legace, who was able to get his glove back before
having to decide whether to attempt a barehanded save.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings built a 2-0 lead before Legace entered the game, and
though the Devils (3-4) were scoreless, New Jersey defenseman
Sheldon Souray probably deserved assists on the goals that gave the
Kings that margin.
</P>
<P>
   First, Souray couldn't control Mattias Norstrom's clearing pass
along the right boards, and when the puck skipped past him, Johnson
picked it up at center ice. Craig Johnson, with Matt Johnson
joining the rush, found himself on a 2-on-1, with only Scott
Stevens back for the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Johnson waited until he was 20 feet out, then fired the
puck past Devils goalie Martin Brodeur, off the right post and into
the net 14:45 into the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt made a great play to make it a 2-on-1,'' said Craig
Johnson, who has been hampered by a groin injury. ``Without him
down there, it probably never would have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   It became 2-0 with 8:10 left in the second period, just after
Brodeur had stopped a shorthanded chance by Glen Murray. Souray
picked up the puck to the right of Brodeur and fed a perfect pass
onto Rob Blake's stick at the blue line. Blake carried the puck
into the slot and beat Brodeur with a wrist shot for the Kings'
fourth shorthanded goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   In the third period, Duchesne's power-play goal _ a 45-foot slap
shot through a screen set by Sandy Moger _ made it 3-0, and
Tsyplakov's late goal completed the scoring. Duchesne's goal
appeared to be a direct result of Robinson's video show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went over what we weren't doing right and things we had to
correct, things like going to the net,'' Robinson said. ``Steve
Duchesne's power-play goal, we had three guys in front, something
we haven't had, screening in front. It's great to see.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an important goal for Duchesne, who had struggled in the
first eight games, perhaps under the weight of expectations brought
by the big contract he signed during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight's a big relief,'' he said. ``I'm ready for the rest of
the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Kings are, too.

STUDENT'S NEW BEGINNING ENDS TRAGICALLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By YVETTE CABRERA, NICK P. DIVITO and BHAVNA MISTRY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Aaron Bruce Nathaniel transferred to suburban
Chatsworth High School one month ago to escape what his parents
called ``negative elements'' and to get his life back on track.
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel, 18, was making new friends, taking four classes on
his way to graduation and a stint in the Army.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, he was shot dead after a fight in a fast-food
restaurant where he was applying for a job. Police have arrested
Jason Jones, 17, of suburban Lancaster on suspicion of murder and
booked him at Juvenile Hall in Sylmar, in L.A.'s San Fernando
Valley near Chatsworth.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is a former area high school student who served time this
year in a Los Angeles County juvenile camp and had been wanted by
authorities since he did not show up for a Sept. 2 court
appearance, officials said. Law enforcement sources said his rap
sheet lists arrests for robbery, burglary, hit-and-run, disrupting
school grounds and theft.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a search warrant, police Wednesday found a handgun
and ammunition in an apartment at the complex where the suspect
fled after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel was trying to escape just this kind of trouble, his
parents said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're angry at the way things turned out,'' said the boy's
father, John Nathaniel, 54, from the family's suburban Altadena
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was looking forward to graduating in June,'' said his
mother, Barbara. ``As soon as he got his diploma he was supposed to
go into the military. . . . That's what he was going to do because
he thought it was a good move for him and his country.''
</P>
<P>
   Just this Monday, he had signed up for the Army's delayed-entry
program, his parents said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very excited. He scored well on the tests and was
looking forward to getting his life together,'' his mother said.
``He was so highly motivated and was just charging ahead to do
this.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're totally devastated; it's such a tragedy. He was a great
kid trying to get his life together.''
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel had transferred from tow other area high schools, his
mother said. She would only say that he was involved in ``teen-age
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He woke up and saw the need for an education, and he was
moving forward and pushing,'' his mother said. ``He's never been
arrested. He's been trying to stay out of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel joined Pop Warner football in the late 1980s, and
continued as a running back at both of his former high schools.
</P>
<P>
   Several shelves of a trophy case in the family's home showcase
Nathaniel's love for the sport: football trophies, plaques and
pictures of him in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Athletics were important in (Nathaniel's) life,'' said Lew
Stueck, football coach at La Salle, a private school Nathaniel
attended for ninth and 10th grades.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Principal John Ring recalled Nathaniel as a friendly
and popular student who was not a disciplinary problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just one of those kids you couldn't help but like,''
Ring said. ``You're always shocked when you hear something like
this, especially when it's somebody you know.
</P>
<P>
   ``The classroom was a struggle for him, but on the field he
could shine,'' said Ring, who was athletic director at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel transferred to Pasadena High School because of
academic reasons, Stueck said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his death, Nathaniel was living at a group home
in suburban Winnetka that he entered on his own, his mother said.
</P>
<P>
   At Chatsworth High, Principal Dan Wyatt said the youth had
completed 20 days of school and was taking four classes to obtain
his diploma.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect was arrested Tuesday night after a two-hour search
of several apartment complexes across the street from the
restaurant where Nathaniel was killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the subject of a current warrant,'' said Janice Jones, a
Los Angeles County probation officer who works out of the Sheriff's
Department's gang detail office at the Lancaster station.
</P>
<P>
   When arrested, Jones initially identified himself as Jason
Jacobs, which is the name of Lancaster High School's varsity
football quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Jones had identified himself as a Lancaster High School student
in registering at Antelope Valley College for two summer 1997
classes -- weightlifting and an independent-living class for youths
in foster homes.
</P>
<P>
   Lancaster High officials wouldn't comment. Antelope Valley Union
High School District officials said their records show Jones had
been a student between November 1997 and January 1998 at Desert
Winds High School.
</P>
<P>
   At Chatsworth High, the mood was somber on campus, where about
20 students were counseled by crisis teams. Other students like
Quincy Adams of suburban Reseda donned black ribbons in memory of
Nathaniel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt really bad because that's messed up,'' said Adams, 15,
a sophomore. ``People are getting killed over stuff that makes no
sense. (The shooting) had a lot of people crying.''
</P>
<P>
   Funeral services for Nathaniel will be held Wednesday at noon at
St. Elizabeth's Church, 1879 N. Lake Ave., Altadena.

SNIPER ATTCKS ON DOCTORS CREATE CLIMATE OF FEAR IN CANADA 
</HEADLINE>

   ANCASTER, Ontario _ For many Canadian doctors who perform
abortions, it has become a grim mid-autumn ritual. They pull their
drapes at night and wear bulletproof vests to the office. They are
told to drive different cars and change the spots they park in from
day to day. Some even schedule their vacations for the first two
weeks of November.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors in this part of Canada have been aware of the danger
since Nov. 10, 1995. A gunman standing in the rain in a wooded
ravine behind the Tudor home of Dr. Hugh Short here, about an
hour's drive from Niagara Falls, fired a shot from a high-powered
hunting rifle through the kitchen window, shattering his elbow and
ending his career at 62.
</P>
<P>
   Five days ago, in a suburb of Buffalo, N.Y., a similar sniper
attack ended the career of another obstetrician, Dr. Barnett
Slepian. But that attack also ended his life.
</P>
<P>
   Short and Slepian were among the five targets of a series of
sniper attacks in Canada and western New York over the past few
years that have so far stumped the police on both sides of the
border. Canadian investigators say they believe that the first four
shootings are related. American investigators are seeking to
determine whether Slepian's slaying is connected.
</P>
<P>
   But the earlier shootings and Slepian's death have sent a chill
through the approximately 1,000 doctors who perform abortions in
Canada, and prompted criticism that the Canadian government is not
doing enough to investigate the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know of anecdotal evidence that some doctors are considering
that they might not be able to continue,'' said Dr. Henry
Morgentaler, whose 20-year campaign led to the full legalization of
abortion in Canada a decade ago. ``It's a very bad situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Lee, president of Joseph Brant Memorial Hospital in
Burnside, Ontario, said this week that doctors stopped performing
abortions at the hospital 18 months ago, in part, out of concern
for their safety.
</P>
<P>
   And Kim Luton, president of the Canadian Abortion Rights Action
League, said 35 percent of Canadian doctors polled in a study
released in January said they do not perform abortions because of
the climate of fear in Canada and the limited number of medical
schools that teach the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Morgentaler says he will go on,'' Ms. Luton said. ``But I
think younger doctors must think to themselves, `Is this worth
doing?'''
</P>
<P>
   Canadian law enforcement officials here say they fear that the
killing of Slepian may not be this year's only shooting. They note
that last year, two doctors were attacked within weeks of each
other _ one in Rochester, N.Y., on Oct. 28 and another in Winnipeg,
Manitoba, on Nov. 11.
</P>
<P>
   [An anonymous caller to a newspaper in Hamilton, Ontario, on
Tuesday threatened a second doctor who performs abortions near
Buffalo, said Jim Poling, the night city editor of the paper, The
Hamilton Spectator. The Associated Press, which first reported the
call on Wednesday night, said the doctor had been warned and was
under police protection.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor, whose identity was withheld at the request of the
police, worked in Amherst, N.Y., the same town where Slepian lived,
the A.P. said. The police in Amherst would not comment on the
report late on Wednesday night.)
</P>
<P>
   Violent, politically motivated attacks are an anomaly in Canada,
a nation that prides itself on being far more tolerant of dissent,
and far less violent, than its southern neighbor. Anti-abortion
groups in Canada are generally considered to be less militant than
their American counterparts. Clinics are picketed, but violence is
comparatively rare.
</P>
<P>
   Morgentaler said he believes the attacks are being carried out
by an American and he decried them as an unwanted byproduct of the
vitriolic abortion battle in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more the United States than Canada,'' he said. ``Those
people are very violent. They are so sure of their stand, they
justify anything. In Canada, you have fewer religious fanatics,
there is much less violence in Canada and it's a much more tolerant
society.''
</P>
<P>
   But other activists say the shootings may be the work of a
Canadian. The attacks have spanned the country and occurred within
weeks of Remembrance Day, Nov. 11. Some anti-abortion groups use
the holiday, the equivalent of Veterans Day in the United States,
as a memorial day for unborn children.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Slepian's killing, abortion-rights supporters in
Canada have accused their government of not taking the shootings
seriously enough, pointing out that a joint Canadian-FBI task force
investigating the shootings was not formed until December 1997 _
three years after the first attack.
</P>
<P>
   A task force coordinator, Inspector David Bowen of the
Hamilton-Wentworth Regional Police, complained that the Canadian
government was not adequately financing the investigation. Bowen
said the task force, largely financed by the communities where the
shootings occurred, has operated on a ``shoestring'' budget of
$100,000.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He said he requested additional funds from the government in
July that would more than double its budget to $250,000. But
federal officials rejected the request on Oct. 15, a week before
the Buffalo slaying. Potential leads, he said, have not been
followed up. ``The work that has not been done is in Ontario,'' he
said. ``There are more investigative avenues in Ontario than other
places.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Brien, a spokesman for the Canadian Solicitor General's
Office, said the Royal Canadian Mounted Police are assisting the
investigation. But he said it has been long-running practice in
Canada for municipal and provincial governments to pay for local
investigators working on nationwide task forces.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian law enforcement officials refuse to confirm the details
of the attacks or discuss their investigation. But the attacks,
which appear to involve different weapons, have been striking in
both their sophistication and ruthlessness.
</P>
<P>
   The first victim, Dr. Garson Romalis, 57, was eating breakfast
at 7:10 a.m. in his home in Vancouver, British Columbia, on Nov. 8,
1994, when two bullets crashed through a sliding glass patio door.
</P>
<P>
   One bullet blew a fist-sized hole in Romalis' left thigh,
shattering his femur and cutting his femoral artery. Romalis
prevented himself from bleeding to death by using his bathrobe belt
as a tourniquet.
</P>
<P>
   The police recovered two shell casings from a wooded ravine
behind Romalis' house, according to press accounts. Law enforcement
officials said at the time that the 5-centimeter, copper-tipped
bullets fired were relatively rare and could possibly have been
from an AK-47 assault rifle.
</P>
<P>
   Romalis, who did not respond to a request for an interview,
still performs abortions and has become more outspoken since the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The attack here on Short, who declined to be interviewed,
occurred a year later. In that attack, a long-barreled hunting
rifle was used. The shooting was especially unusual, Canadian
abortion-rights advocates said, because Short was not widely known
to perform abortions. They believe he was chosen to send a signal
that any doctor who performs abortions is a target.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1996, no attacks occurred. But a year later, on
Oct. 28, 1997, a doctor was shot at in his home near Rochester. The
bullet missed the doctor, who has never been publicly identified,
but he was wounded by flying debris.
</P>
<P>
   Just over a week later, on Nov. 11, a gunman fired on Dr. Jack
Fainman, 66, through the back window of his riverbank home in
Winnipeg about 9 p.m. The bullet struck him in the right shoulder,
inches from his heart. The police would not comment on whether
Fainman, who has declined interview requests since the attack, is
still performing abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever is responsible, the sense of siege threatens to
discourage young doctors from learning how to perform abortions,
Ms. Luton said. She said the future availability of abortions in
Canada is under threat.

COMMENTARY: JUSTICE AT LONG LAST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 11th graf to fix judge's title) (jt) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This summer I wrote two columns about a man named
Jeffrey Blake, who was serving a term of 36 years to life in prison
for the murder of two men in Brooklyn, N.Y., in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   It was a spectacular and brazen crime, an execution in broad
daylight. The victims were in a car. They were killed by a gunman
who ran beside the car and riddled them with bullets from an Uzi as
they tried to get away by backing down the street. The car crashed
into a building and the gunman fled.
</P>
<P>
   A man who claimed to be an eyewitness told authorities that
Blake was the gunman. On the basis of his testimony, and his
testimony alone, Blake was convicted.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that it was almost physically impossible for Blake
to have committed the murders. He was at work that day in the
Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, about 4.5 miles away. And
while the murders took place about 1:45 p.m., during his 45-minute
lunch break, it is highly unlikely that he could have traveled the
requisite distance through busy Brooklyn neighborhoods, ambushed
and executed the two men, disposed of the murder weapon and
returned to work as if nothing had happened by 2 p.m., which is
when his boss and co-workers said he came back from lunch.
</P>
<P>
   It also turned out that the ``eyewitness,'' a flake and chronic
liar named Dana Garner, had witnessed nothing. His girlfriend,
Margaret Allen, who was supposed to have witnessed the murders with
him, said in a sworn affidavit in July that she hadn't seen those
murders ``nor any other murder.'' She added, ``I would remember a
murder if I had seen one.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake recanted several months ago and when he was hooked up to a
polygraph machine, he passed.
</P>
<P>
   I wrote in August that the case against Jeffrey Blake ``was
virtually nonexistent'' and that it was unlikely that Dana Garner
was even in New York when the murders were committed.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday the district attorney for Brooklyn, Charles Hynes,
said he agreed. He directed his office to join in a motion, filed
by Blake's attorney, Michele Fox of the Legal Aid Society, to set
aside the guilty verdict. He said Blake should be released from
prison. That could happen as early as Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Blake's appeals had been exhausted, and Hynes was under no
obligation to reopen the case. But Ms. Fox continued her diligent
efforts to prove her client innocent. After the columns ran, the
DA's office conducted a new investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are convinced,'' said Deputy District Attorney Dennis
Hawkins, ``that the evidence that Legal Aid has found and that
we've discovered in our own independent investigation _ if it had
been revealed at the time of the trial, Jeffrey Blake probably
would not have been convicted.''
</P>
<P>
   What usually happens in such cases, he said, is that the judge _
in this instance Acting Supreme Court Justice Robert Kreindler _
would vacate the guilty verdict and order a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   But the DA's office will not pursue another trial. Hawkins said,
``Since we do not think that would be the fair thing to do, we
would at that point dismiss the indictment against Blake.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake learned of the new developments on Tuesday night, when he
called his attorney from the maximum-security Green Haven prison in
upstate New York. Ms. Fox said: ``It was so wonderful to be able to
tell him, `Jeffrey, you're coming home.' He was so happy. He said,
`Yes-s-s.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fox's feelings are mixed. She had spent several years
working on appeals, convinced that her client was not only innocent
but a decent person.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gratifying that things finally worked out,'' she said.
``I'm grateful to the DA's office for finally looking at the case
again and reinvestigating. But it saddens me that my guy had to
give up eight years of his life before this happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Hynes said he was ``relieved that this thing has been uncovered
and this guy is going to walk out of jail after serving eight
unnecessary years.''
</P>
<P>
   He reflected for a moment on the time when he had been a defense
lawyer, and said: ``The thing that scares the hell out of the
better lawyers _ and I like to think I was one of them _ is
representing someone who is innocent. In this case, not only was
there an alibi that was rejected by the jury, but Garner's cousin,
who was described to me as a spit-and-polish young Marine who was
very believable, testified that Garner was not even in town, and
the jury rejected that. I'm relieved that we were able to find
other witnesses to confirm what the cousin said.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there remains the problem of who committed the
murders. Hawkins, the deputy district attorney, said he and others
were now faced with the task of finding the real killers.

GOALIE RANFORD HURT IN SCRAMBLE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Before the season began, the Anaheim Mighty
Ducks' Paul Kariya joked he might have to protect himself by
getting his stick up.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Kariya's stick wasn't up very high, but it was
high enough to knock Tampa Bay goalie Bill Ranford out of the game
in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Kariya was swinging at a loose puck in a scramble around the net
when he was hit from behind by Jason Cullimore and the blade of his
stick caught Ranford in the eye through his mask.
</P>
<P>
   Ranford went to the dressing room immediately and did not
return. He was replaced by Darren Puppa, who allowed two goals on
the first six shots he faced.
</P>
<P>
   __ Season debut: Ducks defenseman Ruslan Salei made his first
appearance after missing the first six games of the season. Salei,
who was suspended for five of those games and was scratched last
Sunday against Phoenix, picked up his first point of the season in
the first period when his wrist shot was deflected by Kariya for a
power-play goal that gave Anaheim a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   With the return of Salei, Pavel Trnka was the defenseman who did
not suit up for the Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   __ Long season: Tampa Bay, which finished with an NHL-worst
17-55-10 record in the 1997-98 season, never won more than two
consecutive games last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Lightning which came into the game with a three-game winning
streak, its longest since Feb. 1997, won back-to-back games four
times last season.
</P>
<P>
   __ New system: Wednesday's game was the first Ducks game to
feature the two-referee system. Lance Roberts and Don Van
Massenhoven worked the first of 20 Anaheim games this season (10 at
home, 10 on road) that will have two referees.
</P>
<P>
   __ Power-ful: Mikael Renberg's power-play goal in the second
period snapped the Ducks' streak of consecutive penalty kills at 17
and was the first they have allowed at home this season.
</P>
<P>
   __ Marha on injured list: With the arrival of Marty McInnis in
Anaheim, the Ducks placed center Josef Marha on the injured list.
Marha sprained his right ankle in the season opener at Washington
and is at least a week away from returning to the lineup.

HINE DEFENDS SKIP AWAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART WILSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sonny Hine, outspoken trainer of Skip Away, is quick to rush to
his horse's defense when anyone doubts the validity of the
5-year-old's Horse-of-the-Year credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Hine will tell anyone within earshot that the defending
Breeders' Cup Classic champion deserves Horse-of-the-Year honors no
matter what happens in this year's Classic on Nov. 7 at Churchill
Downs in Lexington, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   But Hines is also cautious. A loss to longshot Wagon Limit in
the Jockey Club Gold Cup on Oct. 10 at Belmont Park will do that to
a trainer. He's not ready to dismiss the other nine horses and
declare the Classic a match race between his beloved ``Skippy and
the Bob Baffert-trained Silver Charm.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, during a conference call to announce pre-entries for
this year's Breeders' Cup, Hine cautioned writers to do the same,
to ignore the temptation to make this much-anticipated first
meeting between the two thoroughbred heavyweights a two-horse
showdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about it is, you keep overlooking other horses, he
said. ``When I ran in the Jockey Club the other day, it was
Gentlemen and Skip Away and nobody mentioned anybody else. And you
see what can happen. Some horses will jump up and run the big race
of their life, and it might be good enough if either one of us
stubs our toe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how you can overlook anybody. I like Pat's
(trainer Patrick Byrne) two horses (Touch Gold and Awesome Again).
They're really good horses, and they're running good. Arch is a
really nice 3-year-old. He beat Touch Gold the other day and he won
the Super Derby. And I don't think you can overlook Gentlemen if he
runs.
</P>
<P>
   That said, a couple of writers were eager to forget the other
nine horses and wonder aloud if Silver Charm still has a chance for
Horse of the Year, or if Skip Away's seven Grade I victories in his
last nine races has sewn up the award for the roan son of Skip
Trial.
</P>
<P>
   Said Baffert, uncommonly short on words: ``I can't vote, so I
really can't answer that. That's your guys' deal.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert, who will be looking for his second Breeders' Cup
victory this year, was more talkative when asked what it will take
to beat Skip Away.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be pretty close to him turning for home, he said.
``You can't let him get too far out there. Skip Away likes to take
command, and once he gets going he's gone. He's like one of those
fast running backs -- if he gets in the clear, he's hard to motor
down. To beat him, you can't get too far behind him.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the big two, this year's Classic could include
1997 Belmont Stakes winner Touch Gold, '98 Belmont winner and
Kentucky Derby runner-up Victory Gallop, Gentlemen and Coronado's
Quest, among others. Gentlemen is also pre-entered in the Mile and
there is speculation that trainer Richard Mandella is pointing the
6-year-old son of Robin des Bois for the turf event.
</P>
<P>
   The official Breeders' Cup post-position draw is scheduled for
next Wednesday at 8:30 a.m., PST.
</P>
<P>
   There is a guaranteed $4 million purse for the Classic, which is
contested at 1 1/4 miles on the dirt. Skip Away will undoubtedly go
postward as the fans' favorite to win an unprecedented second
consecutive Breeders' Cup Classic.
</P>
<P>
   If he completes the impressive double under jockey Jerry Bailey,
there will be no Horse-of-the-Year controversy. And if Silver Charm
wins?
</P>
<P>
   Hine said he is surprised there is any doubt, that the award
would be a cinch if Skippy had won the Jockey Club Gold Cup rather
than finishing third behind Wagon Limit and Gentlemen. He mentions
Skip Away's impressive six-furlong work of 1:10.43 at Belmont Park
on Monday and then offers this assessment:
</P>
<P>
   ``We did all the dancing, did all the Grade I's. He couldn't do
more than you've asked from him. But you know how the voters are,
they'll vote and we have no control on what they do, what they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taking Skippy down there ready to run. Hopefully, he'll
show his true class and run his race and there won't be any
question when it's over.
</P>
<P>
   Said Baffert: ``He's (Silver Charm) ready now. Whether he's good
enough or not, we're gonna find out.
</P>
<P>
   Now, about those other nine horses ...

COLLEGE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL COACH INDICTED IN CRACK COCAINE RING
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Cal State Northridge women's basketball coach
Michael Abraham has been indicted for possession and conspiracy to
distribute crack cocaine seized at Burbank Airport last year, FBI
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham, 39, was released on $200,000 bail Wednesday on the
federal charges and placed on unpaid leave from California State
University, Northridge, less than two weeks before the team's first
preseason game. He did not return phone calls and didn't answer the
door at his suburban Northridge home Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my perspective, I'm absolutely stunned,'' said Judy
Brame, CSUN associate athletic director of internal affairs, who
will take over as acting women's basketball coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disheartened, disillusioned, disappointed. We met with the
assistants, and . . . they're stunned. What else can you be?''
</P>
<P>
   The players were advised against talking to the media, but
released this statement on behalf of the team: ``We feel like we
lost a member of our family. We are all shocked but we need to
remain focused on our goals and the things that Coach Abraham wants
us to accomplish. This is just another obstacle we have to
overcome. We believe in our hearts he will be back, coaching our
program.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN President Blenda Wilson was unavailable for comment
Wednesday, and university officials would not say where she was.
</P>
<P>
   Word of Abraham's arrest spread across campus, leaving students
in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a professional coach to be arrested for (conspiracy to
distribute narcotics) is embarrassing for the school,'' said junior
Brandon Bird, a suburban Valencia resident. ``It doesn't make our
campus any better than what it is, and that's saying something.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Kopita, vice president of student affairs, said athletic
director Paul Bubb was writing letters to the families of each of
the players to address the situation. Also, assistant coach Karon
Howell said the players CSUN is recruiting have been contacted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern is to the well-being of our students,'' Kopita
said. ``Let the FBI do its thing and we'll take care of our women's
basketball players.''
</P>
<P>
   Athletic administrators said practice for the women's basketball
team would be closed to outside parties until further notice. Bubb
said a search for a replacement coach wouldn't begin unless Abraham
was found guilty of the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing a search for a new head coach right now isn't really an
option because Michael Abraham is still an employee of the
university,'' Bubb said. ``He's on administrative leave. So there
has to be someone setting up the program while he is on
administrative leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Abraham, who was an assistant coach at Long Beach State and
Oregon State, was hired June 1, 1995, by CSUN. He was 23-59 in
three seasons, going 14-14 last season. His wife, Trisonya, gave
birth to the couple's second child, Michael John Jr., on Oct. 16.
They also have a 2-year-old daughter, Amirah.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury in Nebraska unsealed the indictment against
Abraham this week after reviewing evidence the FBI has been
gathering for more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham was arrested without incident at the CSUN gymnasium
after basketball practice Tuesday evening. A magistrate judge set
his bail, ordering him to surrender his passport and be fitted with
an electronic tracking device.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Nebraska's FBI and U.S. Attorney's offices said
Abraham probably will not face the charges in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect in the next week or two, he'll be here in Omaha,''
said FBI spokesman Larry Holmquist.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. Attorney's Office spokesman in Nebraska said the drugs
were coming from the Los Angeles area and were being distributed to
a group living in Omaha.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation started in February 1996. Federal officials
say that in January 1997 they seized 3 kilos of crack cocaine at
Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport and more than $53,000 in cash at
Epply Airfield in Omaha.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham is charged with conspiracy to distribute and possession
with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of crack cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, he faces a minimum term of 10 years in prison and
a maximum life sentence, Holmquist said. He also could be fined up
to $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham showed up for the bail hearing Wednesday wearing CSUN
Matadors colors -- dark-red shorts with black-and-white shoes and
jacket. He was led out in handcuffs, but attorneys said he would
make bail Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   His wife planned to put up $100,000 immediately, and his father
is expecting to be ready to put up another $100,000 from his
Portland, Ore., home next week.
</P>
<P>
   His father, retired Judge Philip T. Abraham, at one point
presided over the Tonya Harding-Nancy Kerrigan ice-skating dispute.
He owns a Portland home with an assessed value of $450,000,
according to Multnomaw County property records.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Arthur Nakazato warned the
coach to abide by his order to stay in the Los Angeles area, saying
that fleeing ``will basically cause the forfeiture in this case of
your parents' home.''
</P>
<P>
   Nakazato said Abraham can go to Nebraska for court dates and to
Portland to visit his parents, as long as he gives 48 hours'
notice. He also ordered Abraham to pick up an electronic tracker
and wear it around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham quietly said, ``Yes, Your Honor,'' then was led out of
the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Abraham will be tried out of state, unless he
agrees to a guilty plea in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   After a hearing next week, Chief Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard
Drooyan said, Abraham will ``go to Nebraska and we'll never see him
again.''
</P>
<P>
   The cocaine seizure was not an isolated case at Burbank Airport,
which is quickly losing its reputation as an airfield with low
security.
</P>
<P>
   A special task force has seized more than $31 million in drugs
at Burbank Airport since 1995. Airport spokesman Victor Gill hadn't
heard about the charges against Abraham, but wasn't surprised to
hear about the bust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last three years, there's been a lot more activity,''
Gill said. ``The sheriffs and police from several cities have a
strong presence at the airport.''

<P>
   TWO HARBORS, Calif. _ ``Mmm, samples that you can eat.''
</P>
<P>
   That was Northridge's Brian Buaas' opinion of the yellowtail he
planned to consume after removing a portion of its gill for DNA
testing. ``Mother Nature at her best,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the serious business of marine biology, there is room for
levity. With such long hours at sea, it's a prerequisite.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets a little grueling,'' said Larry G. Allen of Calabasas,
a Cal State Northridge biology professor and director of the
university's Nearshore Marine Fish Research Program. ``It can take
us up to six hours to go through the nets. You have to have a
little humor, a little frivolity.''
</P>
<P>
   The graduate students aboard the Yellowfin _ a state-funded
ocean research vessel _ look at the species caught by the nets as
part of the training in the master's program in marine biology. The
monotonous task is occasionally broken up with a lobster-on-the-hat
trick or two; days end with jokes, storytelling and games of
cribbage.
</P>
<P>
   But the long-term goal of the Nearshore Marine Fish Research
Program is much loftier. Its data should assist in more effective
management of the nearshore fish resources, which impact commercial
harvesting and sport-fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Last week near Santa Catalina Island's West End, Allen oversaw
his researchers fetching eight nets stationed just offshore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a crippled boat and two nets to go,'' Yellowfin mate
Paul Skaar radioed from one of three skiffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got three seabass, too,'' Allen replied.
</P>
<P>
   More critical than the boat's malfunctions on this trip were the
white seabass, for it was the slender, silvery fish Allen was most
interested in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We add them to the data base; we measure them, weigh them,''
he said. ``We'll probably pull the otoliths _ the ear bones _ to
help us age them; they have annual growth rings like a tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all goes into the grid we have plotted (at several
locations) from Point Conception all the way down to San Diego. And
over the course of the years, we can look at the patterns of
distribution and abundance of these juveniles and see how strong
the populations are and how strong the recruitment is of babies
every year.''
</P>
<P>
   The other target species in the program are calico bass, sand
bass, spotted bay bass, black sea bass, yellowtail and California
halibut.
</P>
<P>
   Allen and his CSUN graduate students collaborate with UC Santa
Barbara and Occidental College students and scientists in Mexico to
research the fishes' age and growth characteristics, reproduction,
population genetics, food habits, distribution, abundance and
dispersal.Research funding has come from various sources, including
state, federal and private entities.
</P>
<P>
   ``With that money, we can continue to do significant research
and I can fund students to help. They come out and provide most of
the labor and learn in the process,'' Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   Call it a floating classroom. &QL;

ARREST HAS NORTHRIDGE SCRAMBLING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Cal State Northridge's women's basketball team
was poised to rise above mediocrity but could now be bracing for a
crash that could reach into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate effects of coach Michael Abraham's arrest
Wednesday have to do with the season starting in two weeks. But the
long-term effects have to do with recruiting, current players
staying with the program, assistant coaches with limited experience
and public perception.
</P>
<P>
   Already, 6-foot-5 recruit Myiesha Jones of Merritt College in
Oakland said she's had second thoughts about attending CSUN.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I was lied to,'' Jones said via telephone Wednesday
night. ``I feel he was a whole different person than he said he
was, and that this was a scam. I was shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who orally committed to CSUN in September, said it was a
``50-50 chance'' she would sign a letter of intent to attend CSUN
during the early signing period in November after she learned of
Abraham's indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham, 39, about to begin his fourth year with the Matadors,
was indicted and charged with conspiracy to distribute and
possession with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of crack
cocaine, the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States Attorney's Office in Omaha, Neb., contends the
conspiracy spans from Feb. 1, 1996, to Jan. 28, 1997. It involves
more than $53,000 of cash seized at Eppley Airfield in Omaha and
three kilograms of cocaine seized from Burbank Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The school placed Abraham on paid administrative leave.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN assistant athletic director/internal affairs Judy Brame
will take over the head coaching duties, but she stressed she was
only the acting coach and not the interim coach.
</P>
<P>
   Brame, a former basketball coach at CSUN with a 101-89 record,
oversaw her first practice Wednesday. She is considered the No.2
administrator in the school's athletic department. The Matadors
began practice Oct. 18 and will open the season Nov. 14 against
Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The assistant coaches, in terms of the practices, they're
ready to go and I feel fine about that,'' Brame said. ``I don't
know what they're doing in terms of offense, and what they're
running, or defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to practice, the players met with athletic director Paul
Bubb and Brame, but they elected not to talk to the media
afterward. Assistant coach Karon Howell said she was going to
contact the players CSUN was recruiting and explain the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Howell is in her first year of coaching at the college level
after spending the last six seasons at Marlborough School. Tara
Harrington is in her first season of coaching, having graduated
from Stanford in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Frozena Jerro holds the most college experience of any of the
assistants. She's in her second year at CSUN and began coaching at
the college level in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have anything to say at this point in time (about
Abraham). I'm not going to say anything until the courts say what
they have to say,'' Howell said. ``What I can say is it's exciting
(to coach). It's an opportunity to do our best and show what
Michael has taught us.''
</P>
<P>
   Without question, Abraham breathed life into a dormant program.
He was 23-59 in three seasons, but the Matadors went 14-14 last
season. It was their first nonlosing season since 1988-89.
</P>
<P>
   It was also his dynamic personality that enticed recruits to
play for CSUN. On various occasions, players would stop by
Abraham's office to chat, and many said the only reason they
attended the school was because of Abraham.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about the eventual well-being of this team,''
CSUN vice president of student affairs Ron Kopita said. ``To have
this happen at the outset of the season is a concern. The
university supports the efforts of the players.''

DALLAS HIGH SCHOOL COACH WITH CANCER BEATING THE ODDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHARD TIJERINA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Tyler Long is too young to understand what luck is. At
the age of 13 months, he spends his days loving the two people
closest to him _ his mother and father _ while eating honey buns
and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, not worrying about
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   But Mike Long, Tyler's father, knows all about odds.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks about the wonder of life and is reminded of the power
of miracles whenever he picks up his son. And when he gazes into
the toddler's baby blue eyes, he sometimes melts.
</P>
<P>
   Long, who was told by doctors seven years ago at age 33 that he
had terminal cancer, shouldn't even be here. Neither should Tyler.
</P>
<P>
   In his second season as head coach at Dallas Adams High School,
the former assistant under Ray Overton and Johnny Ringo at
MacArthur High in 1995 and 1996 has spent the past six years
battling cancer, ignoring odds and embracing life.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when Long took living for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really the luckiest man alive,'' Long said. ``I believe it
was all faith. I was ``not'' going to die. A lot of times, I think
luck comes from that. Maybe there are one or two kids that I will
coach who I can reach. For some reason, I'm alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Long found out about the cancer in December 1991. He suffers
from CUPS, or cancer from an unknown primary source. His body
produces malignant tumors, and doctors _ who told him he likely
would not live past that Christmas _ said the survival rate was
less than 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Long odds. But the odds were Long's.
</P>
<P>
   Seven Christmases later, Long is still here.
</P>
<P>
   His disease was diagnosed days before the South Garland team for
whom he served as defensive coordinator met Longview in a 1991
Class 5A bi-district playoff loss. Long said his walk off the
field, with Longview's marching band blaring and thoughts of gloom
racing through his head, was the longest walk of his life.
</P>
<P>
   How long would he live? Why was this happening to him? Would his
final football game be a playoff loss? Would he never know a life
as a father or husband? He spent that Christmas alone in a
California hospital room. He returned to school six months later
and has never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   During the past seven years, Long has had 12 operations and a
number of chemotherapy, radiation and bone marrow treatments.
Doctors have removed 6 inches of his small intestine and 6 inches
of his large intestine. Removal of cancerous spots on his throat
sometimes leave him hoarse at the end of a football game.
</P>
<P>
   Every three weeks, Long goes in for a CT scan. Every three
weeks, the questions return. Has the cancer returned? Am I going to
die?
</P>
<P>
   Although doctors continue to tell him that he is terminal, Long
has been clean of malignant tumors for nearly two years. He has
received his first head coaching opportunity at Adams High, an
inner-city school in east Dallas that not only plays in the shadow
of others in its district _ Skyline, Carter and Kimball _ but also
in its part of town. Private-school power Bishop Lynch is down the
road.
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars are 3-6 and close their season next week with
powerful Kimball. Nonetheless, Adams is in third place in District
11-5A and, with a victory against the 7-1 Knights, can secure a
playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   Adams in the playoffs? Stranger things have happened.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Long. Exit odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they say there's a 20 percent chance of rain,'' Long said,
``I bring my umbrella. Then I talk to my team about odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them when I first got here that it doesn't matter what
people tell you. It doesn't always have to be that way, that you're
never going to beat Skyline, Carter or Kimball, that you're just a
3-7 team. No one knows what's going to happen. Look at me: I'm
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Long grew up with football _ his father was a longtime coach and
scout in the NCAA and NFL _ and he also grew up with adversity.
Before Long battled cancer, he battled dyslexia.
</P>
<P>
   Now 40 years old, he is in a situation he loves: coaching at a
school where a large number of students have special needs.
</P>
<P>
   Long thrives on that: ``I need people that need people,'' he
said. ``On this team, there might be 30 kids like that and it's
something new every day. I thrive in that atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike is one of the bona fide good guys,'' said Nimitz coach
Mike Farda, who befriended Long while the two coached in Irving.
``He's had a hard time overcoming some things, but he wanted to
coach and now he got an opportunity. He's the kind of a guy who
always wanted to help kids. Kids are his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Kids keep him young. Kids keep him alive. Together with his
wife, Ashley, Long is living a life he once only dreamed of. Tyler
_ who has two words in his vocabulary, ``Dada'' and ``Mama'' _
keeps him focused. When his son was sick a few weeks ago, Long
slept on the toddler's floor in a sleeping bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hold my hand up and hold his while he slept,'' Long
said. ``I'm not an emotional person, but sometimes, I'm holding him
and all of a sudden I start crying.''
</P>
<P>
   What kind of man will Tyler Long become, his father wonders?
Will he be a third-generation coach, a scholar or something else?
Will Long live long enough to see it happen?
</P>
<P>
   Long doesn't want to hear about the odds. They don't mean much
to him, anyway.

GRIMSON HITS FIRST DOUBLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ It was a minor bit of NHL history fashioned by
a big man in front of the smallest crowd in Anaheim Mighty Ducks
history.
</P>
<P>
   Stu Grimson had played in 510 games and scored only nine goals,
never scoring more than one in a game.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday night the 6-foot-5, 239-pound winger scored twice
in a 3-minute, 31-second span of the second period and the Ducks
went on to defeat Tampa Bay 5-3 before 13,963 at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   The sparse turnout _ the team's previous low was 15,386 versus
the New York Islanders in the team's second-ever game on Oct. 10,
1994 _ saw Grimson score once without ever getting his stick on the
puck and once off a feed from Tomas Sandstrom.
</P>
<P>
   With the Ducks leading 2-1 midway through the second period,
Grimson was skating in front of the Tampa Bay net when rookie Antti
Alto's shot hit him in the skate and deflected past Lightning
goalie Darren Puppa at 11:53.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay pulled back to within one on a goal by Cory Cross at
14:26, but Grimson gave the Ducks another two-goal lead when he
beat Puppa from the slot at 15:24.
</P>
<P>
   The victory increased the Ducks' unbeaten streak to four games
(3-0-1) and moves Anaheim (3-3-1) back to the .500-mark for the
first time since Nov. 28, 1997 when it was 11-11-5.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   After giving up the first nine shots of the game and botching
their first three power plays, including a two-minute, two-man
advantage on which they managed but one weak shot, the Ducks did
open the scoring.
</P>
<P>
   On their fourth power-play chance, Paul Kariya scored his fourth
goal of the season at 16:14 on a nice deflection of Ruslan Salei's
wrist shot.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two minutes later, newcomer Marty McInnis made his
presence felt by centering a pass to Sandstrom who was driving to
the net and jammed the puck past Puppa for a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay goalie Bill Ranford, whose next appearance will be his
600th in the NHL, stopped all eight shots he faced before leaving
the game with 7:46 left in the opening period. He was cut near the
left eye by the blade of Kariya's stick during a goal-mouth
scramble and did not return.

BRUINS BLAST MONTREAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ An entire West Coast swing's worth of goals in one
night. As many goals in one game as in the previous six combined.
Their most prolific one-game output in almost six years.
</P>
<P>
   You get the picture. The Bruins took advantage of two things
Wednesday night to earn a 9-2 victory over the Canadiens _
Montreal's rash of key injuries and a blatant elbow that resulted
in a five-minute major penalty and three Boston goals _ as they
snapped their three-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' fortunes had looked grim going in. They had not only
dropped three in a row but they'd looked terrible doing it. They
had totaled only nine goals in their past six games and had fallen
below .500 for the first time this season at 3-4-1.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Molson Centre, they shook all that off with a
vengeance with their biggest offensive showcase since a 9-4 win in
Hartford Dec. 26, 1992, and their most productive night in Montreal
since a 10-4 blowout Nov. 13, 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Allison and Peter Ferraro led the way with two goals and
one assist apiece.
</P>
<P>
   About the only reason coach Pat Burns hadn't shaken up his lines
was that he didn't have any viable options. But against Montreal,
the status quo was just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scary thing is our top line didn't really play all that
great,'' said Burns. ``They got some power-play goals. But they
know it. I talked to them and said, `Imagine when you really get
going.' It's surprising, there's no doubt about that. I just hope
we saved a couple for (Thursday)'' and the rematch in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Burns was given a beer shower during the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was with the Canadiens, the Bruins fans used to always
throw beer on me,'' he said, ``and now that I'm with the Bruins,
the Canadiens fans throw beer on me. As long as it's my brand, I
don't care.''
</P>

   Ted Donato started things off by breaking out of his prolonged
goal slump. He hadn't scored in 38 games, playoffs included, since
Feb. 26 against Buffalo. His line, which included center Joe
Thornton and right wing Steve Heinze (who missed the game with a
gashed right ring finger and was replaced by Ferraro) had been
struggling mightily, perplexing Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton, who showed much more involvement than in the previous
few games, set up Boston's first goal. He dished the puck from the
right circle to Ferraro, who was charging to the net. Ferraro got
his stick on the puck, but goalie Jose Theodore stopped it. It
bounced in front and Donato pounced on the rebound, banging it past
the netminder at 1:36 of the first period.
</P>
<P>
   The rout was on.
</P>
<P>
   The checking line combined to make it 2-0 at the 10-minute mark.
P.J. Axelsson, behind the net to the right of the goalie, skated
the puck out and fired. Theodore made the stop, but Chris Taylor
popped in the rebound from near the left post.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's margin swelled to 3-0 with 39.7 seconds remaining in
the first, with Allison's line doing the honors. Sergei Samsonov
picked off an attempted clear by Matt Higgins and dished the puck
to Allison on the right faceoff dot. Allison relayed the puck to
Dmitri Khristich, whose quick feed found Samsonov in the left
circle for the score.
</P>
<P>
   At 3:37 of the second, the game got physical when Bruin
heavyweight Ken Baumgartner went toe to toe with Dave Morrisette,
who had knocked out Khristich for the opener with an elbow during
the exhibition season.
</P>
<P>
   Then things got flat-out ugly at 6:10 when Montreal's Dave
Manson delivered a deliberate elbow to the head of Axelsson, who is
known as Gumby for his ability to shake off hits. This time he
didn't. Axelsson rapped his head off the glass behind the Montreal
net and was treated for several minutes by trainer Don Del Negro
before heading to the bench. He returned to the game, but Manson
did not _ he was assessed a five-minute elbowing major and game
misconduct. It's likely he will be suspended, since the NHL has
been cracking down on blows to the head.
</P>
<P>
   Burns harangued Manson when the defenseman left the ice, and
Manson yelled back.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a cheap shot,'' said Burns. ``It was very, very
cheap. If you see it on the slow motion, he double-pumped his arm
and just laid right into him. You could break a guy's jaw. That was
preplanned and he wanted to do that and it's unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston made the Canadiens pay, scoring three times on the power
play within a 51-second span.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro started the barrage at 9:09. Grant Ledyard passed the
puck to Thornton behind the net. Thornton threaded a pass across
the slot for Ferraro cutting down the left circle. Ray Bourque set
up the next one, firing a slapper from the middle of the point that
Khristich tipped past Theodore at 9:34.
</P>
<P>
   Ledyard ballooned the lead to 6-0 at the 10-minute mark, chasing
Theodore in favor of Jocelyn Thibault. The Habs thought they had
one back at 16:45, but Benoit Brunet, who put the puck in the net,
was in the crease at the time, so the goal was nullified.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro earned his second goal and third point when he made it
7-0 1:41 into the third.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Recchi spoiled Byron Dafoe's shutout bid with a goal at
9:50.
</P>
<P>
   Allison made it 8-1 during a two-man advantage at 13:51 and
scored again at 14:36. Higgins closed out the scoring at 16:13.

SOUTH AFRICAN TRUTH COMMISSION MAY WITHHOLD REPORT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout)   (sw) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRETORIA, South Africa _ Facing two court challenges, the Truth
and Reconciliation Commission on Thursday was on the verge of
withholding its final report, which was due to be released at noon
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The last-minute challenges came from both F.W. de Klerk, the
last apartheid era president, and the African National Congress,
which led the struggle against apartheid and now rules the country.
Both are apparently accused in the report of gross violations of
human rights.
</P>
<P>
   De Klerk, 62, who helped negotiate the end of South Africa's
white supremacist government and shared the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize
with President Nelson Mandela for that work, had objected to a
finding by the commission that he was ``an accessory after the
fact'' in the bombings of the headquarters of a church group and of
a labor federation in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the 17-member panel, Archbishop Desmond Tutu,
was furious about the last-minute tactics, especially from the ANC,
which had been requested since August to ready its response to the
report. He told journalists here, ``I have struggled against a
tyranny. I didn't do that in order to substitute it with another.''
</P>
<P>
   The archbishop said that the commission had decided to delete
the references to de Klerk from the 3,500-page report with ``great
reluctance,'' but said that the commission needed time to prepare
to fight the legal challenge. Seeing that the commission was
willing to make concessions to de Klerk, the ANC immediately filed
its own legal challenge late Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Another member of the commission said that it would fight the
ANC's legal maneuvers to the highest levels.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters, who were required to show up at 6 a.m. in Pretoria to
be locked in a theater with copies of the commission report, sat
cooling their heels while the court battle was fought in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Tutu expressed disappointment with de Klerk's
move. In a statement, he said, ``It upsets me deeply. We have been
scrupulously fair to Mr. de Klerk, and we reject the contention
that we have been engaged in a vendetta against him.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the ANC wants to block the commission findings
about its conduct during the liberation struggle.
</P>
<P>
   While the commission's report is expected to lay overwhelming
blame on the former white government for atrocities, it has also
found the ANC responsible for the torture and killing of spy
suspects, bombings in civilian areas and the killing of political
enemies, including members of its rival Zulu-based Inkhata Freedom
Party.
</P>
<P>
   The decision on de Klerk seems certain to damage the
commission's credibility. The panel, created as a way of putting
South Africa's brutal past to rest without the expense and
political divisiveness of trials, has caused controversy from the
start. It has held more than 160 hearings throughout the country,
listening to both victims and to perpetrators seeking amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   But many whites say the commission is on a witch hunt aiming to
humiliate former government officials and Afrikaners in general. De
Klerk has once before forced the commission officials to court and
won an apology from them for calling him a liar. Some political
analysts said Wednesday's decision to strike de Klerk would only
further the belief that the panel lacked impartiality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The withdrawal of the findings can't help but be seen as a
lack of certainty on their side,'' said Sampie Terreblanche, an
economist and political analyst at the University of Stellenbosch,
who has supported the commission. ``Whether we like it or not, the
whole report gets a knock from this.''
</P>
<P>
   De Klerk's spokesman, David Steward, said the former president
was ``very confident'' that he would win when the case goes to
trial in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very happy to be in the courts now rather than dealing
with the Truth Commission,'' Steward said. ``The fact that they
agreed to withdraw creates the definite impression that they
specifically concocted a case to involve Mr. de Klerk in a negative
finding.''
</P>
<P>
   The ANC accused the commission of trying to ``besmirch our
struggle by denouncing it as a gross violation of human rights.''
The congress said in a statement, ``The ANC and the millions of
people who were part of this struggle will always be proud of what
they did to insure that, in the process of the destruction of a
vile system, they did not themselves resort to vile methods of
struggle on the basis that the means justified the end.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There are probably few subjects that get South Africans more
excited than the issue of the Truth Commission and whether it is a
worthy cause or a waste of money. The events of the last few days
have only added to the debate.
</P>
<P>
   For some, like Pal Martins, 34, a former member of the ANC's
armed wing, the fact that all sides of the political spectrum are
in an uproar is a good thing. ``The mere fact that everyone is
complaining means that the Truth Commission has done its work,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But others say that too many questions are being raised about
the panel's competence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole affair is beyond the pale, a mockery of justice,''
said Roboy Vonholdt, 56, a sheep and ostrich farmer. ``We should
all turn our backs on the past and move forward. We need them and
they need us. Let's all make money and let good economic conditions
prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission's report is supposed to be a broad and detailed
summary of South Africa's human rights history, from 1960 to 1994,
when elections open to all races ended white minority rule. It will
parcel out moral condemnations and recommend individual
prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   Tutu said that other threatened legal challenges had led to
fewer people being named as rights violators than originally
planned. He said more than 400 people had been notified that they
would be implicated to give them a chance to respond. Some 15
argued themselves out of the report or could not be reached and
were therefore deleted from it, he said. The commission is required
by law to give advance notification to anyone it intends to
implicate in its report.

TEXAS-ARLINGTON POINT GUARD OVERCOMES BROKEN BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DARRIN SCHEID 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Melissa Broadus said people have described
her in ways that don't fit a Division I point guard, or even a
women's basketball player of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   Too slow. Too short.
</P>
<P>
   Can't shoot. Can't penetrate. Broken back.
</P>
<P>
   Really.
</P>
<P>
   Broadus, in addition to being told by a high school coach that
she would never play college basketball anyway, begins her senior
year at UT-Arlington with small fractures in her vertebra that send
wrenching pain down her legs.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, she can't feel her legs at all.
</P>
<P>
   Broadus is still slow, still short, even without the back
problems. She is also the starting point guard for the Mavericks
until somebody takes her spot. UTA coach Mike Dean said he tried to
replace her for the past two seasons, and he simply hasn't been
able to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell her every season that I'm going to recruit somebody
better than her to come in here and play the point,'' Dean said.
``It seems like every year, she's out on the floor. The word I use
to describe Melissa is tough. If this whole team was as tough as
Melissa, we'd be pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Broadus, a 5-foot-7 native of Conroe, said she has no choice but
to be tough.
</P>
<P>
   Just like in high school, when she refused to give up her
college dream, Broadus refuses to give up on basketball even when
the back pain becomes unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   She remembers the first time she collapsed on the court as a
sophomore in a game at Stephen F. Austin and couldn't feel her legs
for a few minutes. Players gathered around her, wondering if she
would be able to walk off the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared, but I had to pretend it wasn't that bad because
all my teammates were freaking out around me,'' Broadus said. ``I
knew something was wrong before that game, but I didn't know it was
that bad.''
</P>
<P>
   When the doctors confirmed that her L-5 vertebra had two small
fractures, she decided to fight it with pain killers and exercise.
Broadus said pain killers don't work any more. Exercise helps a
little.
</P>
<P>
   She sits out of some defensive drills in practices and continues
to play.
</P>
<P>
   Broadus has taken most of the remedies you read about in the
newspaper or see on television. She sometimes has to sleep on the
floor with her legs propped in a chair, or she stands when
everybody else is sitting.
</P>
<P>
   Those 90-minute classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays, sitting in a
hard chair, are the worst.
</P>
<P>
   But not playing basketball would be even worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basketball has done a lot for me,'' Broadus said. ``I've been
able to go to school, and I've done some things that people have
told me I would be able to do. If I walked away from the game, I
think I would look back and never be able to forgive myself.''
</P>
<P>
   So Broadus keeps going, and she keeps running the UTA offense.
</P>
<P>
   A transfer from Klein Oak to Conroe Oak Ridge before her senior
year in high school, Broadus spent her first two seasons at UTA
backing up Gale Haynes. Dean said two seasons with Haynes, the
school's all-time assists leader, prepared Broadus for last year's
starting role.
</P>
<P>
   She played 25 minutes per game, helping the Mavericks to an 18-9
record and third-place finish in the Southland Conference. Broadus
finished with a career-high 49 assists.
</P>
<P>
   This year, her role will be even more important, Dean said.
</P>
<P>
   While Broadus fights through pain, she is expected to run an
offense that lacks a true center and help groom a lineup of two
freshmen and four sophomores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, the other players can use my injury as a
motivational tool, especially the freshmen,'' Broadus said. ``Sure,
whatever will help our team. I think we're going to have a good
season, even though people say we're too small. People said that
about me, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Broadus ignored those people.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the too-short, too-slow girl with back problems who
can't shoot always finds her place on the court at Texas Hall.

MART LINEBACKER TAKES HITS ... ON HIS WEB SITE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Henry Witt III has tackled a lot this year.
</P>
<P>
   For the Mart High School football team, the 5-foot-10, 180-pound
senior defensive end is the second-leading tackler.
</P>
<P>
   And for posterity's sake, Witt has tackled the chore of
producing and maintaining the Mart Panther Football Site
(www.angelfire.com/tx/martpanthers) _ one of the more dynamic and
detailed homemade sites about a high school football team in Texas,
or anywhere for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   Witt's site has updated information, historical content, good
organization and interactive features. He researched his material
from local record books and by simply asking older folks and alumni
around town.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best part of my site? That's for my visitors to find
out,'' Witt said.
</P>
<P>
   Mart is a District 2A-23 school 20 miles east of Waco. Witt
works on the site at school, updates the statistics pages on Monday
and posts the score as soon as he gets home from the game on Friday
nights.
</P>
<P>
   Witt launched the site in April, mostly as a simple text page.
After learning the finer techniques of Internet coding, he made the
site public in May. It's received about 5,000 visitors so far, Witt
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mart coach Terry Cron admitted he knew virtually nothing about
the Internet, but the 49-year-old coach gave Witt his blessings to
create a page and told him ``just do it right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the things he puts down there _ maybe they're
truthful, but I don't want to give anyone any bulletin-board
material,'' Cron said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Witt: ``Everything that's opinion on the site is my opinion
_ not anyone else's. Everything has disclaimers.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Mart's opponents have used the opportunity to do
some woofing. This week, the Panthers travel to Riesel in a big
district clash.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're our rival and they talk the most trash,'' Witt said.
``Just about everyone in the district also talks a lot. I've even
heard from some school called Winters in Texas. They say `Beware
the Blizzards.'''
</P>
<P>
   But it's not all talk. Witt also has had alumni from as far away
as Florida and California contact him via e-mail. Even Cron has
noticed the response.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I'm hearing about it is real good _ from alumni,
other people,'' Cron said. His sisters in Pampa and California are
even reading the exploits of the purple and gold Panthers through
Witt's site.
</P>
<P>
   Will Witt continue the site once he's graduated and off to
nearby McLennan Community College in Waco?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really not sure if I'll have the time,'' he said. ``I
might have to give it to someone who's going to be a senior.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoever inherits the site has a tough act to follow.

BOXER VAULTS TO BIG LEAD IN NEW POLL 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN WILDERMUTH  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    In a stunning political reversal, Democrat Barbara Boxer now
has a commanding nine-point lead in her re-election bid against
Republican state Treasurer Matt Fong, according to the last
pre-election Field Poll.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Field Poll three weeks ago showed that Fong had pulled out to
a 4-point lead in the November 3 contest and appeared to have Boxer
fighting for her political life. But Boxer's nonstop campaigning,
combined with a multimillion-dollar television ad campaign, has
erased that deficit and put the former Marin County supervisor on
the brink of victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``She looks very strong,'' said Mark DiCamillo, the poll's
director. ``Obviously, things can change, but a week before the
election she was comfortably ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer's late surge appears to have broken open a race that has
been close since March, when the senator held a 46 percent to 44
percent lead over Fong. She has done it by reversing voters'
opinion of her lesser-known opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voters' view of Matt Fong has completely changed compared
to what it was three weeks ago,'' DiCamillo said. ``It seems to be
the ads.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than a month, Boxer has been running a high-powered,
hard-hitting series of 30-second TV spots focusing on Fong's more
conservative positions on such hot-button issues as gun control,
abortion, HMO reform and environmental regulation. While Fong's
backers howled that Boxer was misrepresenting Fong's positions and
trying to scare voters into supporting her, the strategy seems to
have worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boxer spent millions of dollars in ads trying to move Fong off
the (political) center and portray him as someone of the right,''
DiCamillo said. ``Before, the focus was all on Boxer. Now, she has
shifted the spotlight to Fong.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The strong Boxer trend in the new poll is not a result of the
current flap over Fong's $50,000 contribution to an anti-gay and
anti-abortion religious group, DiCamillo said. The story broke
Sunday, midway through the six-day poll that ended Tuesday, but
there was no real change in the numbers after that date, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shift (from his previous poll result) was evident in the
first half of the polling, which shows the change is broader than
just a scandal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Just three weeks ago, voters' impression of Fong was running
nearly 3-to-1 favorable, 55 percent to 17 percent, and even more
Democrats liked him than did not, by a 34 percent to 31 percent
margin.
</P>
<P>
   Fong still has an overall favorable rating, 47 percent to 36
percent. But only 24 percent of Democrats view him favorably,
compared to 58 percent who do not.
</P>
<P>
   Among independent and third party voters, the reversal is even
more stunning. In early October, Fong's favorability rating was 55
percent positive and 8 percent negative. Now he is seen favorably
by only 28 percent of that group, compared to 43 percent who give
him a negative rating.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Boxer has seen her once abysmal ratings turn around
dramatically in her favor. While earlier this month her desperately
low favorable rating of 42 percent was overshadowed by a 48 percent
unfavorable rating, the new poll puts her favorables at 52 percent
and her unfavorable rating at 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The new survey contains virtually no good news for Fong. Even
the gender gap, which had earlier shown the Republican with
overwhelming support from male voters, has shifted. While women
continue to favor Boxer, this time by a wide 55 percent to 39
percent margin, men also now back the incumbent senator, 47 percent
to 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fong is carrying the conservative vote by an 80 percent to 18
percent margin while Boxer has an even wider, 90 percent to 4
percent, lead among self-identified liberals.
</P>
<P>
   But the worst news for Fong, who has tried desperately to
position himself as the moderate alternative to the more-liberal
Boxer, is that middle-of-the-road voters support the Democratic
incumbent by a nearly 2-to-1 margin, 58 percent to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reappraisals for Boxer have generally come from Democratic
and independent men, who were less inclined to support her three
weeks ago,'' said DiCamillo. Boxer has managed to bring the
independents and moderates, voters who were truly up for grabs in
this election, firmly into her camp, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among voters expressing a preference for Fong, almost half say
they are voting against Boxer, not for him.
</P>
<P>
   Fong campaign officials said during the weekend that their poll
numbers started shrinking two weeks ago and blamed it on the
Washington, D.C., budget stalemate between President Clinton and
the Republican leaders in Congress. While a Los Angeles Times poll
released last Friday showed Boxer with a 5-point lead in the Senate
race, Republicans were confident they had turned that deficit
around.
</P>
<P>
   The new poll appears to throw ice-cold water on that optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be hard for Fong to turn this around,''
DiCamillo said.
</P>
<P>
   The poll was taken among a representative statewide sample of
1,012 registered voters, of whom 678 are considered likely voters
in the November election. It has a statistical margin of error of
plus or minus 4 percentage points.

MINORITY COMMUNITIES FOCUS OF AIDS INITIATIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   By LOUIS FREEDBERG  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ &LR;   &LR; Describing it as one of his ``greatest
victories'' in his recent budget agreement with Congress, President
Clinton announced Thursday a $156 million program designed to fight
the spread of AIDS among blacks and other minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the program is to give minorities access to the
same level of treatment available to white males, for whom the
incidence of the disease has declined dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``AIDS is now hitting hardest in areas where knowledge about the
disease is scarce and poverty is high,'' said Clinton, at a White
House ceremony attended by Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and members
of the Congressional Black Caucus. ``In other words, as so often
happens, it is picking on the most vulnerable among us.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cited the spread of AIDS among minorities: African
Americans make up only 13 percent of the U.S. population and 43
percent of all new AIDS cases; Latinos represent 14 percent of the
U.S. population and 22 percent of new AIDS cases.
</P>
<P>
   The money will be used to bolster several government AIDS
assistance programs that serve minorities. Some of the new funds
will be used to pay for ``crisis response teams'' made up of health
practitioners who will move into communities where the risk of the
disease is highest. Other funds will be used to provide additional
testing and counseling, run workshops, and set up drug prevention
programs to slow the high infection rate among drug addicts.
</P>
<P>
   The funds will also be used to pay for expensive drugs like
protease inhibitors that have been successful in preventing people
who are HIV positive from contracting the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lifesaving therapies cannot be a luxury reserved only for the
rich,'' said Clinton to applause from an audience made up largely
of African Americans representing a range of civil rights and other
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher declared the spread of AIDS
among blacks and Latinos a ``public health emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that AIDS was the leading cause of death among blacks
between 25 and 44 years of age. Most alarming, he noted, was that
almost two-thirds of AIDS patients between 13 and 24 years old were
African Americans. ``The complexion of the epidemic has changed,''
said Satcher. ``Increasingly it is becoming an epidemic of color.''
</P>
<P>
   Denise Stokes, 29, who was infected with the AIDS virus when she
was 13, described how she had suffered because many African
Americans are ``too timid to talk candidly about AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   In a moving speech, Stokes recounted some of her own
difficulties in getting adequate care and treatment. Most African
Americans with the disease, she said, were too poor to ``walk into
hospitals waving insurance cards or cash'' and were often
``stripped of their dignity by people who are supposed to help
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The full extent of the AIDS epidemic among minorities was
documented in a report released earlier this year by the Kaiser
Family Foundation, based in Menlo Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``It provided us with the statistics to make the case that HIV/
AIDS in the African American community should be treated as a
public health emergency,'' said Waters.
</P>
<P>
   The report described how the number of AIDS deaths among whites
declined by 32 percent in 1996, but by only 13 percent among
blacks. The cause, the report said, was because of unequal access
to health care among blacks.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Space shot overshadows America's voting rights
nightmare
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some 3.9 million Americans have been stripped of their right to
vote _ 1.4 million of them African-American men, disenfranchised at
a rate seven times than of white men.
</P>
<P>
   Is a bombshell a bombshell if no one hears it go off? With the
exquisite timing at which do-gooders excel, Human Rights Watch and
The Sentencing Project dropped their voting report at the moment
when Congress had just adjourned in notable chaos, the Mideast
talks were at riveting stalemate and John Glenn was suiting up for
space.
</P>
<P>
   What might have been a goodly boom on a slow news day made
barely a plink.
</P>
<P>
   The joint study isolates the United States as the only nation
that uses its criminal courts to strip citizens of the vote for
long periods of time, in 14 states long after they have completed
their sentences and in 10 of those states permanently.
</P>
<P>
   At current rates, in states that disenfranchise ex-offenders, as
many as 40 percent of black men may soon be barred form the polls,
the study reports. As it is, 31 percent of black men in Florida and
Alabama already are permanently disenfranchised.
</P>
<P>
   As is usual where such huge racial disparities occur, the
disproportion is not just a reflection of some inherent cultural
kink.
</P>
<P>
   In the years around the turn of the century when old-Confederate
states were rushing segregation laws onto their books thanks to an
indulgent U.S. Supreme Court, disenfranchisement was embraced with
the avowed purpose of suppressing black voting.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina restricted the vote in crimes its legislature
believed ``the Negro'' was especially prone to _ thievery,
housebreaking, adultery, arson, wife-beating and others. The
Alabama legislature disenfranchised for crimes of ``moral
turpitude'' with the admitted goal of securing white supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   Disenfranchisement traveled hand in hand with the then-new laws
levying poll taxes, setting up literacy tests and creating
whites-only primary elections. The trick these days, in some
throwback parts of the rural South, is to put even first-time,
relatively minor offenders on 10 or 20 years probation to hold down
black voting.
</P>
<P>
   The enactment of lengthy and often mandatory sentences for the
crack cocaine violations that are more common to the black than to
the white community _ while offenses involving the white-favored
power cocaine are treated less harshly _ has modernized and
urbanized the racial injustice.
</P>
<P>
   But the racial double standard aside, how smart is it to take
the vote away from felons?
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be arguing for ``coddling criminals'' _ and,
really, when have we EVER done that? _ to realize the best way to
prevent repeat offenses is to plug ex-cons into workaday life. To
``socialize'' them, in the jargon.
</P>
<P>
   Germany sensibly charges its penal officials to encourage
prisoner voting. By taking away the right to vote, we lessen the
opportunity for ex-cons to develop a sense of social proprietorship
and instead forcibly estrange them in a way that actually works to
construct a permanent criminal class.

TURN CLOCK BACK AND TIME STILL FLIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Tuesday Oct. 03)  
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do you sigh when dating your check, as if you just discovered
it's already the end of October? For, how could it be the end of
October when it was just July? For that matter, how can my child
have a career when she just started kindergarten?
</P>
<P>
   And when did my favorite Italian restaurant become Thai? How
come the cosmos have stopped blooming so soon? And if the frost is
on the pumpkin, does this mean it's nearing time for ... oh, no,
don't even say it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know. That holiday,'' said the woman at the dry cleaners.
``When we start getting close to it people start to panic. Always
happens this time of year.''
</P>
<P>
   This time of year? Happens all the time. This is not a seasonal
concern.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend we gained an extra hour and I think I already spent
it. Squandered it on Highway 80 coming back from Sacramento about a
month ago, stuck in traffic for one hour. I know because I stared
at the huge clock on some car dealer's sign from 4:05 to 5:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   What a waste of time.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe, in fact, I borrowed on that hour when I stole some
minutes to sit on the deck one night when the harvest moon settled
into a redwood. That could have been a finer use of time.
</P>
<P>
   However, with one lone bonus hour, we'll never catch up and get
done the things we don't have time for.
</P>
<P>
   The passage of time, especially as it gallops past like the
Headless Horseman, is a frightful thing. Can't it slow down for a
second? A year?
</P>
<P>
   Give us a slow year and maybe we could make a dent in our lists.
</P>
<P>
   Think of all the mixed messages we get about time.
</P>
<P>
   We're supposed to take our time, but not waste our time.
</P>
<P>
   We've got all the time in the world but time waits for no one.
</P>
<P>
   Time heals. Time goes by.
</P>
<P>
   Time is on your side, but don't stop thinking about tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   I was doing my crazed rabbit routine the other day, rushing into
a grocery store and skidding to a stop at the checkout counter,
tipping over the gum display and dumping the contents of my wallet
out to gather enough quarters for a bottle of juice. It was
tropical flavor and made me think of a string hammock under a palm
tree.
</P>
<P>
   The clerk looked up and said, ``Remember to breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   I said, thank you very much and I meant it very much. ``Remember
to breathe.'' I see the same reminder on people's computers and
refrigerator magnets. It's catching on. It could replace ``Have a
Nice Day.''
</P>
<P>
   It speaks to our racing selves. We don't even have clocks that
make noise anymore but something is going tick-tick in our heads.
But how can we slow down, how can we breathe? We're running out of
time.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I see, according to Health Magazine, there's a reason that
time seems to speed up as you get older. Someone did a test and
asked people in a study group to imagine when three minutes had
passed. People between the ages of 19 and 24 guessed it almost to
the second. A group in the ages of 45 to 50 said three minutes had
passed when actually three minutes and another 16 seconds had
passed. And people aged 60 to 65 waited for three minutes and an
extra 40 seconds to pass before they said three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   So, the author says we really do misjudge time and it probably
has to do with that brain chemical dopamine that powers our
internal clock and which begins to lessen in the mid-20s but really
drops off in the 40s. We think we have another 16 seconds when time
is really up. No wonder we feel like life is passing us by.
</P>
<P>
   I actually think it comes from being a kid and wishing that
summer would please hurry up and this stupid class would be over,
that we were old enough to drive and that we could close our eyes
and make it be Christmas. We get our wish, but not until much later
and then it's a cruel joke. Christmas does come early, not when
you're 8 years old, but when you're much older and it's October and
you want to say, ``Back, back.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it just means that we all need to become Buddhists and be
here now.
</P>
<P>
   I know a lot of people who followed that idea. They were there
then but they're nowhere near here now. You can't even get them on
their cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   I like the idea though and sometimes I make myself stop and
record the moment I'm in. It doesn't stop time but it recognizes
that what's happening now is worth recording.
</P>
<P>
   I'll say to myself, ``I'm sitting with my friend and we're
having tea and she's talking about living in Turkey and there are
yellow leaves blowing on her patio.''
</P>
<P>
   Some day when I wonder where the time went, I'll call that one
up. Yesterday we were 16. Tomorrow is 2001, not the movie.
</P>
<P>
   It gives one pause. If one could dare to.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: THE TWO MICROSOFT TRIALS
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, Nov. 1.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At any one time, only about 75 spectators can
squeeze into the small federal courtroom where the most important
antitrust case in many a decade is being tried. Step out for any
reason, and you'll lose your seat to the next person waiting in
line.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who
presides over the legal fate of Microsoft Corp., invited a visiting
group from the former Soviet republic of Moldova to observe an
afternoon session. The delegation bumped a dozen people who had
been trying for hours to get in.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 75 places on the hard wooden benches, 40 are reserved for
reporters. We lucky few are guaranteed seats _ so long as we toe
the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of you may be new to this place and so may be unfamiliar
with the rules,'' a stern U.S. marshal told us. There's a ban on
smoking, drinking and eating in the courthouse. And the press is
also muzzled.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the breaks, you aren't allowed to say anything in the
hallways to anyone in the form of a question that requires an
answer,'' the marshal explained. ``This rule will be strictly
enforced.''
</P>
<P>
   During one such break, Ken Auletta, who is covering the trial
for The New Yorker, asked Microsoft lawyer John Warden whether he
was ``having fun?''
</P>
<P>
   Replied Warden, who is being paid hundreds of thousands of
dollars by Microsoft to turn the government's case into legal
chopped liver: ``I'm not permitted to comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Cell phones and pagers are allowed, but must be turned off in
the courtroom. Tape recorders and cameras are barred altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The ban prompts some of the wealthier news outfits to
double-team the trial. Bearing one of the coveted press passes, one
member of such a journalistic duo enters the courtroom, a pen and
pad in hand.
</P>
<P>
   The partner remains permanently outside (a setting made familiar
this year by Kenneth Starr's grand jury doings) to cover the
parallel Microsoft sound-bite battle. It takes place twice daily,
when Jackson calls a halt for lunch and after the trial recesses
for the day.
</P>
<P>
   This fight carries no juice with Jackson, who is trying the case
from the bench without a jury. But it remains of concern to
Microsoft honchos, who hope to keep their stock from tanking. The
government's trust-busters care because they'll need to win a
verdict in the court of public opinion if they are ever to chisel
penalties into the Windows monopoly logo.
</P>
<P>
   While the First Amendment is on life support inside the
courthouse, press hounds are taking their full revenge outside its
confines.
</P>
<P>
   One fine fall day, standing before what has come to be known as
``Monica Beach,'' federal antitrust chief Joel Klein and David
Boies, his top gun in the courtroom, fielded questions about the
high-stakes trial.
</P>
<P>
   They then strolled up Pennsylvania Avenue for several blocks to
have lunch. A photographer broke off from the pack to tag along. He
walked backwards, snapping frames every few seconds as he went.
</P>
<P>
   A few passersby looked askance at the strange scene. But the
lone pressie with the motorized camera paid no heed: at that point,
there were no U.S. marshals in sight to impede his backward
progress.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Too many flavors for my taste
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many years back, when Mel Ott still was hitting home runs down
the short right field line in the Polo Grounds and when Rita
Hayworth was knocking 'em dead simply by letting her hair fall on
her bare shoulders, I could name all the models of American cars.
</P>
<P>
   There were three kinds of Buick: Four-door, two-door and
convertible. There were three kinds of Packard: Four-door, two-door
and convertible. And so on.
</P>
<P>
   Jello came in six delicious flavors: Strawberry, raspberry,
cherry, orange, lemon and lime.
</P>
<P>
   Chapstick was Chapstick, one kind. Now Chapstick comes in more
delicious flavors than Jello used to, and I can't even recognize an
American car let alone tell you the models.
</P>
<P>
   The wide selection of goods available to today's consumers, I
suppose, is a benefit but it confuses me.
</P>
<P>
   Mom bought me brown shoes to wear when not wearing high-top
sneakers, and black shoes only for weddings, bar mitzvahs and
funerals. Now I've got five different types of sneakers _ depending
on whether I want to run, walk, sail, garden or take on a shopping
mall. Plus dress shoes of varying colors _ depending on what tie I
wear.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of potato chips do you like: Bar-b-qued, unsalted,
cheddar-flavored, Hawaiian-style, sour cream and onion-flavored,
Cajun spice or nacho-flavored? I like plain potato chips. Can you
still get them?
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, while roaming the aisles of a pharmacy, I mentioned
to my wife that it would be a good idea if we bought some suntan
lotion as we were going to the beach and I had allowed my skin to
get pretty milk-white.
</P>
<P>
   You cannot just buy suntan lotion any more. You must buy it by
the number that determines how red or brown you want your skin to
turn _ if you want it to turn at all.
</P>
<P>
   Want a pretty good burn? Get a 4 or less. An eight will give you
a tan without the pain. A 21 will keep you close to milk white and
a 24 is a waste of time in the sun. And, I found out while
transfixed on this maze of lotion options, there is a pre-tan
lotion as well as an after-tan lotion.
</P>
<P>
   Who came up with this gimmick, and do you believe it does what
they say it does?
</P>
<P>
   Those of you who have a few years, remember when you just went
to the doctor? He fixed everything, or at least tried to. That
which he didn't fix, the pharmacist did. Now, a plain old doctor
seems more to be a way stop en route to any number of specialists.
</P>
<P>
   You went to a race track and you placed your bet either as win,
place or show with a daily double on the first and second races.
Now you've got double doubles, perfectas, trifectas, quinelas,
Pic-Six, Pic-Seven, Pic-Eight, Pic-Everything and a late daily
double just in case you missed the early daily double. Some people,
I am told, still bet win, place or show, but they are oddities.
</P>
<P>
   Have a Coke is what we used to say. Now it requires questions. A
Classic Coke? A Diet Coke or a Caffeine-Free Diet Coke? A Cherry
Coke?
</P>
<P>
   There were eight baseball teams in the National League and eight
in the American League. There were six teams in the National Hockey
League, 11 in the National Basketball Association and 10 in the
National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   I've lost track of how many there are now and doubt that many
occasional fans could name every city in the NHL and NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you read my lament as a sign of aging. Don't. I can cope
with it all, I can select from all the labels. What I ask, however,
is whether all of it is necessary.

   BOOKS-WOLF _ When Tom Wolfe visited Atlanta to research ``A Man
in Full,'' his novel about race relations and real estate
developers, he practically salivated over the prime literary
territory he discovered. ``I don't understand why there aren't 20
novels set in Atlanta,'' he told his friend Mary Rose Taylor at a
gathering at the Margaret Mitchell House. Others have wondered the
same thing. (O'Briant, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   BOOKS-SKUBE _ Place is what Eudora Welty once called ``the
crossroads of circumstance,'' the soil from which fiction draws its
particularity. It is one of fiction's ``lesser angels,'' content to
occupy the background while character and plot, among other things,
pass before us like the big floats of the parade. But it is an
essential background nonetheless. (Skube, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   MINIINTERVIEWS _Short interviews with Barbara Kingsolver, John
Edgar Wideman, Nanci Kincaid, John Holman, Russ Rymer and Ann
Waldron; short excerpts from Terry Kay's ``The Kidnapping of Aaron
Greene,'' Waldron's bio of Eudora Welty and Tom Wolfe's ``A Man in
Full''; and lists of new fiction, southern fiction, nonfiction,
bios, gift books and author signings. (Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   SCIENCE/MEDICINE
</P>
<P>
   BLACKHEALTH _ Health conference on problems facing
African-Americans, including information on clinical trials aimed
at minorities. President of the National Medical Association, Dr.
Gary Dennis, will be there. (Guthrie, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   MALE-BREASTCANCER _ For people who thought men don't get breast
cancer, Montel Williams revelation that he had a double mastectomy
at age 19 was a shocker. Men do get breast cancer, though rarely,
and 500 a year die from it. Often the cancer is more advanced when
they discover it, and it spreads more quickly in men, who have less
breast tissue. Looking to find a Georgia man who had it and
survived. (Kim, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT/ARTS
</P>
<P>
   TVSURFER _ ATLANTA _ NBC's two-part ``The Temptations'' starting
Sunday night is a loving but lopsided recounting of one of the
greatest Motown acts ever. But the music's great. (Harris, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>

Wrestling's Greatest Secrets Revealed,'' made by Bruce Nash, the
same guy who created Fox's wildly successful ``Breaking the
Magician's Code'' series. Ooh, betcha Bill Goldberg's really
scared. Grade: B. (Longino, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   BOOKS-WOLF _ When Tom Wolfe visited Atlanta to research ``A Man
in Full,'' his novel about race relations and real estate
developers, he practically salivated over the prime literary
territory he discovered. ``I don't understand why there aren't 20
novels set in Atlanta,'' he told his friend Mary Rose Taylor at a
gathering at the Margaret Mitchell House. Others have wondered the
same thing. (O'Briant, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   BOOKS-SKUBE _ Place is what Eudora Welty once called ``the
crossroads of circumstance,'' the soil from which fiction draws its
particularity. It is one of fiction's ``lesser angels,'' content to
occupy the background while character and plot, among other things,
pass before us like the big floats of the parade. But it is an
essential background nonetheless. (Skube, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)

   MINIINTERVIEWS _Short interviews with Barbara Kingsolver, John
Edgar Wideman, Nanci Kincaid, John Holman, Russ Rymer and Ann
Waldron; short excerpts from Terry Kay's ``The Kidnapping of Aaron
Greene,'' Waldron's bio of Eudora Welty and Tom Wolfe's ``A Man in
Full''; and lists of new fiction, southern fiction, nonfiction,
bios, gift books and author signings. (Atlanta

</P>
<P>
   BLACKHEALTH _ Health conference on problems facing
African-Americans, including information on clinical trials aimed
at minorities. President of the National Medical Association, Dr.
Gary Dennis, will be there. (Guthrie, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   MALE-BREASTCANCER _ For people who thought men don't get breast
cancer, Montel Williams revelation that he had a double mastectomy
at age 19 was a shocker. Men do get breast cancer, though rarely,
and 500 a year die from it. Often the cancer is more advanced when
they discover it, and it spreads more quickly in men, who have less
breast tissue. Looking to find a Georgia man who had it and
survived. (Kim, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

<P>
   TVSURFER _ ATLANTA _ NBC's two-part ``The Temptations'' starting

 &HT;    Slow down in old Georgia
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STEWART COUNTY, Ga._The past isn't just present in this patch of
plains country about 30 miles south of Columbus, where lonely
two-lane blacktops wend through endless cotton fields and wizened
farmers amble as slow as sorghum around downtown Lumpkin, the
county seat.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the past is all-encom-
</P>
<P>
   passing, a gentle but unyielding force that pulls visitors back
... to the 1950s, the 1850s, even to a time before time was kept.
</P>
<P>
   No Batman rides or prancing cartoon characters mar the
antebellum authenticity of Westville, the ``living museum village''
that is Lumpkin's main attraction. No high-rises or water slides
dot the primeval banks of Lake Walter F. George, which marks the
county's western boundary and is home to more than 2,500
alligators.
</P>
<P>
   And no golden arches or Big Chickens spoil the Eisenhower-era
quaintness of Lumpkin's tiny town square, where Minnie Williams
mans the soda fountain at Dr. Hatchett's Drug Store Museum and Sam
Singer Jr. peddles peach preserves and cast-iron toy banks at the
Singer Co., billed as ``Georgia's oldest hardware store.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart County isn't for the cell phone set. Dyed-in-the-wool
city folk may think the pace here is a bit poky. But if you're
willing to tune out the modern world for a while, you'll find a
soul-enrich-
</P>
<P>
   ing glimpse into Georgia's history, along with a timeless
tranquillity.
</P>
<P>
   Westville
</P>
<P>
   Vinnie Miller knows soap. The 78-year-old resident of Cuthbert,
20 miles south of Lumpkin, has been making it for 60 years. ``My
mama used to make it, and when I got married she taught me,''
Miller says as she stirs a brew of lye, water and bacon grease that
will later be cooled and cut into chunks for sale at Westville's
gift shop. ``The best time to make it is during a full moon. It
makes it harder. I don't know why.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller is one of several craftspeople who display their skills
daily at Westville, a 50-acre working village that attempts a
realistic depiction of Georgia life during the 1850s.
</P>
<P>
   Just up the road from Miller's kettle, at the pottery shop,
Steven Hawks demonstrates how to throw a pitcher on a foot-pedaled
pottery wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Over at the Marrett Farmhouse, one of 25 early 19th-century
structures that Westville has bought and moved to its grounds since
it was founded in 1966, Fanny Smith proudly displays a bin of
biscuits baked minutes before in cast-iron skillets on a brick
hearth.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the village, bootmakers, candle-dippers and weavers
ply their trades, while Lonnie Bennett shuttles visitors around via
a wagon pulled by two mules, Doc and Dan.
</P>
<P>
   Through Nov. 15, you can also witness harvest-related labors,
part of the village's annual Fair of 1850. There'll be cotton
ginning, sugar cane grinding and syrup making.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not all work at West-
</P>
<P>
   ville. Drop by on Sunday afternoons and catch a baseball game,
played by 1860 rules (no gloves; bats can be round or flat) on the
village green. The Christmas season brings special celebrations,
including tree lighting ceremonies (using candles) on Dec. 12 and
19 and the traditional Burning of the Greens on Dec. 26.
</P>
<P>
   -- Information: 10 a.m.-5 p.m. Tuesdays-Saturdays, 1-5 p.m.
Sundays. $8; $7 college students and senior citizens; $4 students
K-12. One-half mile south of downtown Lumpkin at the intersection
of U.S. 27 and Ga. 27. 1-888-733-1850.
</P>
<P>
   Florence Marina State Park
</P>
<P>
   The signs, posted prominently throughout this 150-acre park 16
miles west of Lumpkin, are unequivocal. ``Do Not Feed the
Alligators,'' they order. Park manager Terry Trowbridge explains
that, though the gators that populate Lake Walter F. George are
generally afraid of people, if people start feeding them, they
might lose that fear.
</P>
<P>
   Big, toothy reptiles aren't the only denizens of the park, which
sits next to one of the lake's natural deep-water inlets in the
heart of the Eufaula National Wildlife Refuge. Egrets and herons
bob for shad and baby catfish in the shallows near the rented boat
slips. Crappie, brim and bass roam the lake, trying to elude the
fisherman's hook.
</P>
<P>
   There are also more than 250,000 human guests annually, who come
to fish, ski, camp and hunt. (The wildlife refuge offers limited
hunting opportunities, granted by lottery.)
</P>
<P>
   Campers find the accommodations a cut above commercial
campgrounds. ``They squeeze you in at those places,'' says Charles
Madsen of Rock Hill, S.C. He and his wife, Dotty, are on a 17-day
camping trek across the South. ``We always stay in the state parks
if we can. They're just so much prettier. And this one might be the
prettiest we've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaded by courtly oaks draped in Spanish moss, the park's 44
campsites are outfitted with electrical outlets, sewer system
hookups, running water and cable TV, installed, Trowbridge says,
because campers wre clamoring to watch the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   For those who don't care to rough it, cabins _ two now, four
more by January _ offer full kitchens, showers, queen-size beds and
fireplaces.
</P>
<P>
   They're just a short hop from the swimming pool, tennis courts
and miniature golf course. And if you feel up to a small hike, and
have brought along some mosquito repellent, the park's educational
center offers walking tours of the nearby Rood Creek Indian mounds.
</P>
<P>
   -- Information: 7 a.m.-10 p.m. daily. $2 parking fee. Camping,
$16. Cabins, $65-$75. 16 miles west of downtown Lumpkin on Ga. 39.
912-838-6870.
</P>
<P>
   Providence Canyon State Park
</P>
<P>
   A few miles east of Florence Marina State Park sprawls one of
Georgia's great wonders. Or should that be blunders?
</P>
<P>
   The breathtaking, multihued ravines in the 1,108-acre Providence
Canyon State Park weren't created by millions of years of natural
erosion, like their Western cousin, the Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   No, we have poorly informed 19th-century farmers to thank. In
the early 1800s, settlers deforested the area for farming. Water
was allowed to run off the land unchecked, and it soon began to
wear away the sandy soil. By 1850, ditches 3 to 5 feet deep had
been cut. Today, there are 16 canyons, some as deep as 150 feet.
They've hit sea level, so they won't get any deeper. But they are
getting wider, at a rate of between 1 and 3 feet each year.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of the few instances in which man's mistakes have
resulted in something beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came here in the spring and it was so pretty we decided to
come back,'' says Jo Wilkinson, on retreat with a group of
over-55ers from Epworth United Methodist Church in Columbus. The
seniors, dubbed the Vintage Group, are headed down to the picnic
area for a spot of lunch before they tackle one of the park's
hiking trails.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure I won't do the seven-mile one,'' admits Wilkinson,
65. ``But I'm going to walk some.''
</P>
<P>
   Those not inclined to hike can linger at one of the many canyon
overlooks and try to name the varieties of wildflowers that grow in
the crevices. The state park boasts Georgia's largest natural
concentration of plumleaf azaleas, the flower used in the Callaway
Gardens logo.
</P>
<P>
   -- Information: 7 a.m.-6 p.m. daily through April 14. $2 parking
fee. 7 miles west of downtown Lumpkin on Ga. 39C. 912-838-6202.
</P>
<P>
   Lumpkin
</P>
<P>
   This town of about 1,800 may be the hub of Stewart County, but
it's blissfully free of hubbub. It's also free of hotel rooms _
visitors are directed to Days Inns in nearby Richland and Cuthbert
_ and a tad short on eateries.
</P>
<P>
   Folks who've worked up an appetite traipsing around Westville or
touring the state parks can find sustenance at Dr. Hatchett's Drug
Store Museum, which serves sandwiches, salads and old-fashioned ice
cream sodas. While you're there, check out the displays of
apothecary jars and medical equipment once owned by James Marion
Hatchet, a Civil War physician.
</P>
<P>
   Save time for a stroll around the town square. Pop into the
Singer Co., opened in 1838 by German immigrant Johann George Singer
and run today by his great-great-grandson Sam. The hardware store's
original rolling ladders remain, and there's a display of ledgers
that detail puchases made up to 1881.
</P>
<P>
   Antiques aficionados will want to tour the Bedingfield Inn, a
stately manor built in 1836 by a local physician. The inn, now a
house museum with peeling columns out front, served as a stopping
place for stagecoaches traveling between Eufaula, Ala., and
Americus.
</P>
<P>
   -- Information: Drug Store Museum: 11 a.m.-7 p.m.
Wednesdays-Saturdays, noon-7 p.m. Sundays. 912-838-6924. Singer
Co.: 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Mondays-Saturdays, noon-5 p.m. Sundays.
912-838-4300. Bedingfield Inn: tours 1:30-5 p.m. daily. $2.
912-838-6419.
</P>
<P>
   -- Getting there: From Atlanta, take I-85 south to I-185 south
to Ga. 27 (Exit 1). Follow Ga. 27 into Lumpkin, or turn right on
Ga. 39C to Providence Canyon and Florence Marina state parks.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Two days before Christmas, farmer Scott
Brown telephoned Palm Beach County's environmental resources
office. This was no Yuletide courtesy call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to start cutting the trees in an hour,'' Brown
warned, intending to clear 12 leased acres in suburban Delray Beach
without a permit. ``Come on over.''
</P>
<P>
   At 11 a.m., with sheriff's Deputy Sam Raineri and Sgt. Scott
Smith watching, Brown climbed into a back loader and knocked down a
20-foot Brazilian pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Raineri and Smith immediately arrested Brown and ordered him to
appear in court. The county was ready to show Brown and other
would-be violators that their environmental rules had teeth.
</P>
<P>
   But now, it is Brown, the only person ever prosecuted for a
county environmental crime, who is smiling.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 2, County Judge Deborah Pucillo acquitted Brown, 42, on
the second-degree misdemeanor charge, sparing him a 60-day jail
sentence or a $500 fine.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ruled that Brown's tree-killing wasn't criminal.
Pucillo agreed with Brown's argument that he didn't need a permit
because the land was formerly used for hog farming. Agricultural
land is exempt from permit rules.
</P>
<P>
   Brown wanted to clear the site for sod farming. The land is
about a mile north of West Atlantic Avenue, between Hagen Ranch
Road and Florida's Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   In a memo released Wednesday, county officials blame Raineri and
Smith for failing to appear at the trial, the State Attorney's
Office for its handling of the case, and the judge for refusing to
allow evidence to be admitted at trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a travesty of justice,'' county Commission Chairman Burt
Aaronson said Wednesday. ``It gives people a license to do what
they want against code.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials are waiting for Brown's next move. His attorney, Mark
Perry of Delray Beach, said Brown is contemplating it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everytime he does it (cuts trees), we'll rearrest him again,''
said county environmental chief Richard Walesky.
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes a lot of sense, doesn't it?'' Perry responded.
``We'll be in front of the same judge. We now have the legal right
to do what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   In January 1997, the county issued its first citation against
Brown, who lives in Boynton Beach, for illegal vegetation clearing.
He had plowed several acres of woods _ including some native
species that were supposed to be protected _ on a different parcel.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby residents of the Newport Cove and Emerald Pointe
subdivisions were outraged because those trees provided a 30-foot
buffer between their backyards and the turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1997, Brown and the county reached an agreement; he
agreed to plant a few hundred new bushes and trees.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown refused to get a permit to clear the nearby 12-acre
tract. Perry said he advised Brown to push the issue by arranging
the late December tree-clearing exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Brown picked the Brazilian pepper, an exotic tree that the
county encourages people to destroy. But even killing that tree
requires a permit, and the county feared that Brown would go after
protected trees next.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very blatant _ thumb your nose at the law,'' Walesky
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the county's case against Brown fell apart in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the arresting officers don't come, you're stuck,'' said Ken
Selvig, chief assistant state attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Selvig disagreed with the county memo suggesting that Assistant
State Attorney Lisa Viscome was unprepared for trial. A related
problem was that court rules forbid county attorneys from helping
state attorneys try cases about county laws.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Judge Pucillo denied the state's motion to present
evidence that Brown's property was not bonafide agricultural land.
</P>
<P>
   Aaronson said the county will draw a line in the sod. ``We'll
continue to fight this,'' he said.

 &HT;    Through a glass darkly: Abortion and theology
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The murder of Dr. Barnett Slepian, shot in the back in
his kitchen, just returned from a religious ceremony at his temple
with his wife and three children, reminds that now we see through a
glass darkly, as the Bible says. Sacred texts of every religion _
Catholism, Judism, Hinduism, Islamic or Morman teachings _ struggle
to explain the mystery of life, its origin and what it means.
</P>
<P>
   When does life begin?
</P>
<P>
   It's a theological question that haunts.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans of deep religious faith believe that life begins
at conception, a belief to be respected. But some Jewish sects hold
to the belief that life begins at birth, a belief which must also
be respected. The best that secular reasoning could do, through the
U.S. Supreme Court's 1972 Roe v. Wade ruling, is note that no state
can force on all its citizens a singular belief of when life
begins. The Roe court declared that the state has a legitimate
interest in the protection of ``potential life'' after the point of
viability, after the time a fetus can exist outside the mother's
womb. That is still the law of the land, and in Georgia no woman
may have an abortion after that point unless her life or health is
in danger _ three physicians must concur. In my view, Georgia's law
is a legitimate exercise of the state's interest.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who struggle with the grey areas of the abortion
question get squeezed by the radicals on both sides. But there's no
room for grey in the taking of life in the name of life, in the
gunning down a father of three children. The Right-to-Life movement
must make a clear break with violent defenders of its cause. It
should post a reward for Slepian's murderer. The sincere
anti-abortion advocates must rise up and separate themselves from
the terrorizing of abortion providers no matter how much they
disagree with them. Because of threats of violence, approximately
85 percent of rural counties in America today have no doctor who
will perform an abortion for any reason. Period.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Slepian was known to make house calls to some of his elderly
patients. He offered fertility treatments to childless couples
seeking to become parents, delivered babies, heralded new life_and,
yes, saw it as part of his professional commitment to perform legal
abortions he felt necessary and justified. Other abortion doctors
have been attacked _ he is the first to die.
</P>
<P>
   Murder in the name of life, fatherless children, grieving wife.
</P>
<P>
   Some decisions are too important, too personal, for the
political arena. Decisions about starting a family, when and
whether two human beings are ready to commit to the selfless
challenge being parents demands. Other than the limited state
interests laid out by the courts, government has no role in such
_partisan politics less.
</P>
<P>
   Child bearing decisions are rooted in the freedom of the human
body and soul. They are rooted in love. Love isn't up for political
debate. But freedom must be. Former Republican Sen. Alan Simpson of
Wyoming, a conservative champion of of individual freedoms,
commented recently on what's different about the U.S. Senate today
from the time when he was elected in the 1978. There might have
been one vote on abortion, he said, instead of the 69 presented to
the last Congress. Lawmakers who demand so many votes on the
abortion issue ought to demand one on the death penalty for
anti-abortion terrorists
</P>
<P>
   When does life begin? As a mother of three, I don't expect to
understand the miracle of of life in this life. I see through the
glass darkly. And I see differently from some of my family and
friends. But that does not keep them or me from holding the same
deep reverence for life.

 &HT;    `War of the Worlds' panic remembered
 &HT;    By Bob Batz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Sixty years after a radio Halloween prank scared
the daylights out of listeners all over America, one might wonder:
Could it happen again?
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the right circumstances, I think it could,'' said Glenn
Walters, 68, a University of Dayton communications professor who
has spent much of his life studying the radio dramatization of H.G.
Wells' classic novel, The War of the Worlds .
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 30, 1938, The War of the Worlds, which starred actor
Orson Welles and chronicled a Martian invasion of Earth, was
presented as a news broadcast instead of a drama. Despite a message
at the top of the show that told listeners it was fictional, the
program created panicked incidents all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   In Dayton, law enforcement agencies, newspapers and WHIO-AM
(1290), which aired the Mercury Theater broadcast, were flooded
with telephone calls. There were reports that people in a trailer
camp at Dayton's Island Park started hooking up their trailers to
flee. In Springfield, people gathered on street corners to scan the
skies for alien spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   Walters was 8 and living in Oakwood when he heard the original
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was marvelously done broadcast, and even though it would be
a lot harder to scare listeners today because we are much more
sophisticated, if somebody did it well, it might be possible,'' he
said, adding: ``If it were presented late at night, there's a
certain portion of the audience that just might buy into it, at
least for a little while, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   As a tribute to the 1938 broadcast, Channel 50 _ the
student-operated, closed-circuit cable TV station at UD _ will air
a special featuring one of Walters' The War of the Worlds lectures
at 7:45 p.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
   At 7:45 p.m. Friday, WGXM-FM (99.5) _ UD's student-operated
radio station _ will broadcast the first 25 minutes of the original
hourlong The War of the Worlds.
</P>
<P>
   UD's station will wrap up the tribute with several Orson Welles
films, including Citizen Kane and A Touch of Evil .
</P>
<P>
   Dayton's WING-AM (1410) will broadcast the original 1938 program
at 8 p.m. today, Thursday and Friday and at midnight on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Sci-FI Channel gets into the act at 9 p.m. Friday with
Martian Mania: The True Story of The War of the Worlds. Director
James Cameron will look at why the broadcast was so powerful.

</P>
<P>
   A. SCOURING AN ANCIENT TEXT FOR CLUES TO ARCHIMEDES : A

perhaps anywhere: a production with 100,000 actors. What is amazing
about this emperor is his search for immortality. By Tomas Eloy
Martinez. 1,000 words.

TAKING STOCK, BALANCING TRADEOFFS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Thursday Nov. 5)  
 By MARY J. LOFTUS   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The birthday party invitation, from a friend in Minneapolis, was
computer-generated, printed on a brochure-style triptych.
</P>
<P>
   It read ``By the time I turned 30, I thought I would have ...
the perfect career ... a husband ... a kid ... and a house.''
</P>
<P>
   The lines are accompanied by clip-art: a woman with a briefcase,
a man and woman in formal dress gazing into each other's eyes as
they dance, a cute baby curled over to touch his toes and a
contemporary suburban ranch home.
</P>
<P>
   Opening the first panel, it continued, ``Instead, I'm relieved
that I don't have ... a workaholic life ... an ex-husband ...
day-care worries ... or a mortgage.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, with illustrations of a woman in a business suit midway
up a ladder, a man perusing a laptop computer, the same baby
crying, and a checkbook with $1,500 made out to ``The Bank.''
</P>
<P>
   The next panel: ``I'm really happy that I have: many talents and
many interesting adventures ... lovely friends and a loving family
... two sweet kitties ... and an apartment with real furniture. So
come celebrate my 30th birthday!''
</P>
<P>
   Heidi has always done unconventional things. She quit journalism
to go into construction work, subsidized her creative writing by
working on assembly lines in a variety of factories and is one of
the most creative people I know.
</P>
<P>
   So I wasn't surprised that she was throwing a bash to celebrate
how her life had evolved contrary to expectations.
</P>
<P>
   By 30, apparently, it was time to take stock and look at what
she had, not what she didn't.
</P>
<P>
   After all, as almost everyone found out who stayed on the road
best traveled by minivan, it's not all peaches and parties from
this side, either.
</P>
<P>
   But, to be truthful, Heidi is the exception.
</P>
<P>
   Most of my friends who aren't married yet want to be. Most who
are married but don't have kids yet are trying. And most of my
friends who swore they'd never own a couch, let alone a house, are
well-entrenched in their three-bedroom, two-baths.
</P>
<P>
   The vision of Prince Charming and the white picket fence isn't
so easy to dislodge. Partly, of course, because there's some truth
to it. Romance is magical. Love is grand. Babies make you ``grow a
new heart,'' as Rosie O'Donnell said after she adopted.
</P>
<P>
   But my friend Heidi is right about the downside. Many marriages
won't last until death do us part. Being a parent means giving up
substantial amounts of money and time and more than a few personal
goals. And a house anchors you firmly by the weight of what you
store there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when everything I owned could fit in a car,'' an
older reporter said to me as I drove off after my first internship.
He said it with envy. I didn't understand what he meant then. I do
now.
</P>
<P>
   So, as it ends up, my married-with-children friends spend a
great deal of time waxing nostalgic about the carefree adventures
of their solo days.
</P>
<P>
   Can life be such a balanced tradeoff? Does every choice negate
something else?
</P>
<P>
   Therapists would say the marriage, the children, the
commitments, are ways of developing ... every bit as enlightening
as a trek across Europe or a solitary summer spent keeping a
journal in a cabin by a lake.
</P>
<P>
   They would also say that the single life, well led, can be just
as rewarding ... creating a family of your own devising, having
time to pursue your talents, interests and passions.
</P>
<P>
   (That's the thing about therapists. They can be an irritatingly
affirmative bunch.)
</P>
<P>
   As I watch the new crop of coming-of-age television dramas _
``Ally McBeal,'' ``Buffy, the Vampire Slayer,'' ``Dawson's Creek,''
and ``Felicity'' _ I am struck by how clever and wise and jaded and
worldly these teens and twentysomethings sound.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, even while championing their angst and confusion, they
are able to find courage hidden beneath their insecurities; cut to
the heart of conflicts; value true friendships; and have torrid,
exciting and meaningful relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Of course they are.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty- and fortysomething television writers are scripting
their dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   If we only knew then what we know now.
</P>
<P>

writer. She has master's and specialist degrees in marriage and

 By STEPHEN L. COHEN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    John Glenn's historic journey into orbit at the age of 77 has
returned some of the luster to a space program sorely in need of a
little excitement. Thirty-six years after becoming the first
American to orbit the earth, Glenn is doing it again: he will
boldly go where no septuagenarian has gone before.
 &HT;    The mission has clearly raised NASA's profile at a time when it
needs to foster public support for projects like the International
Space Station.
 &HT;    Critics have taken notice, describing Glenn's flight on the
space shuttle Discovery as an obvious publicity ploy. But both
Glenn and the space agency insist that his participation in the
mission will yield scientific benefits that could improve our
understanding of the aging process.
 &HT;    The ``aging studies'' planned for the mission are actually a
series of tests that will examine how Glenn's body responds to the
rigors of space flight. Multiple organ systems will be analyzed --
evaluating everything from the electrical activity of his heart to
the status of his immune system -- to see if an ``old'' body reacts
differently than a younger one.
 &HT;    If Glenn's body shows a distinctive response, scientists hope to
discover clues that could shed light on how the body ages.
 &HT;    ``We would need to ask why aging has changed the response
pattern,'' explains Dr. Ronald White, associate director of the
National Space Biomedical Research Institute. Additional studies
would then have to be performed to explore this question.
 &HT;    But even if Glenn reacts differently than younger astronauts, no
reliable conclusions can be drawn from a study sample consisting of
only one person. White acknowledges this limitation, but he notes
that there are other approaches we could take to learn about the
aging process. This is because space travel seems to mimic the
aging process in some unexpected ways.
 &HT;    For reasons that remain unclear, space travel induces a series
of ailments surprisingly similar to some of the classic problems of
old age. For instance, both astronauts and the elderly often
experience impaired motor coordination, sleep disturbances and the
loss of muscle mass and bone. Both groups also tend to experience
problems with balance and impaired immune function.
 &HT;    As White points out, these parallels could prove useful in
helping us understand the mysteries of aging. By searching for the
cause of the problems seen in astronauts, we might learn more about
similar problems faced by the geriatric population.
 &HT;    And if the underlying mechanism for these changes is similar in
both groups, then space could serve as a unique ``laboratory'' for
the study of aging -- in effect, a space lab would accelerate
certain age-related changes, making them easier to study.
 &HT;    Though space travelers and the elderly seem to share certain
physical characteristics, there is one key difference between the
two groups: the astronauts appear to recover fully on their return
to earth. This difference might be exploited to our advantage as
well.
 &HT;    By studying how astronauts recover after space travel, we might
learn how to help the elderly recover in a similar fashion. Of
course, all of this depends on a direct link between
``age-related'' and ``space-related'' physical problems -- if the
problems of the elderly turned out to be significantly different
from the problems seen in astronauts, then space research would
probably be of limited value to the aging population.
 &HT;    This is why the aging studies planned for the Discovery flight
may yield little useful information for older Americans. Moreover,
strictly speaking, they aren't really ``aging studies'' -- they're
simply a series of tests on a single 77-year-old man to see how his
body reacts to the extraterrestrial environment. While we may learn
something about the effects of space flight on John Glenn, it seems
unlikely that we'll learn much about the aging process itself.
 &HT;    So is the Discovery mission a publicity maneuver or a geriatric
research expedition?
 &HT;    It's probably a little of both. NASA certainly has gained
enormous publicity from Glenn's participation, and his research
will probably tell us more about the elderly in space than the
elderly on the ground.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, as White observes, ``The senator has been able to
inspire hope in the elderly that they can still do extraordinary
things.''
 &HT;    In the end, this may be the most important legacy of the
Discovery mission. At the very least, Glenn's journey into space
will inspire an aging population with the knowledge that it's never
too late to do the impossible, and that the definition of ``growing
old'' is fluid indeed.

 &HT;    
 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    On Election Day, Michigan voters will decide whether to become
the second state to permit physician-assisted suicide as they vote
on ''Proposal B.''
 &HT;    This is the state where Dr. Jack Kevorkian has helped 100 people
commit suicide and where he has been tried for assisted suicide
three times and acquitted. It is also the state where Kevorkian's
lawyer is running for governor.
 &HT;    A few weeks ago, polls revealed a disturbing 48-43 margin of
support for the measure, but more recent polls report 54 percent of
likely voters opposed, thanks to TV ads by religious, medical and
civic leaders.
 &HT;    Similar referenda in Washington State, California and Oregon
were very close. (The Oregon Death With Dignity Act was approved by
voters last November.)
 &HT;    Sadly, Kevorkian's success has already changed how America
thinks and views itself. ''There was a time when we thought that
the highest value was preserving human life,'' says Wesley J.
Smith, author of ''Forced Exit: The Slippery Slope from Assisted
Suicide to Legal Murder.''
 &HT;    ''We no longer do. Now the highest value is allowing people
personal freedom, even if the cause is wanting to kill themselves.
It has changed our very nature as a society. Many people no longer
view suicide as wrong.''
 &HT;    Of course, Kevorkian claimed the people he helped die all had
terminal, acute and painful illnesses. However, autopsies by county
medical examiners of Kevorkian's victims revealed that 80 percent
did NOT have terminal illnesses. Many were not in pain. In fact,
seven victims had nothing physically wrong, but were simply
depressed.
 &HT;    Thus, one flaw of such a law is that many people will be helped
to kill themselves simply because they are depressed, or fear that
they will become a burden to their family.
 &HT;    Another flaw in Proposal B is that medical examiners would be
stripped of their authority to investigate assisted-suicide deaths.
So the opinions of future Dr. Kevorkians could not be contradicted
with scientific evidence that the patient was not close to death.
 &HT;    Further, Proposal B promotes abuse and deception by requiring
physicians to lie on official death certificates, stating that the
cause of death was the person's disease, not suicide.
 &HT;    ''This has the effect of making it more difficult to detect and
prevent the abuses which many fear will accompany the legalization
of physician-assisted suicide,'' says former Oakland County
prosecutor Richard Thompson, a long-time Kevorkian foe. Proposal B
is ''nothing more than a menu for `the perfect murder.'''
 &HT;    There is no requirement in the 12,000-word proposed law that
family members be notified that a relative has been given a lethal
prescription. However, out-of-state family members can travel to
Michigan to receive suicide drugs to kill themselves. How's that
for family values?
 &HT;    Oversight of the law would be given to a committee of 14 doctors
and 3 members of the public, all of whom ''shall not be opposed''
to the measure. By eliminating those opposed to physician-assisted
suicide, Thompson says, ''They have effectively put the fox in
charge of the chicken coop.'' Its meetings and even its written
decisions would not be open to the public. Secrecy is needed to
hide evil.
 &HT;    The Detroit Free Press, which is liberal on many issues,
editorialized: ''Whatever your view of life, death, morality,
medicine or law, if the time ever comes for you or your loved ones
to face such a choice, Proposal B is not the choice you want. Vote
NO on Proposal B.''
 &HT;    Voters in Hawaii and Alaska will vote on another important moral
issue: whether to allow ''marriages'' of same sex couples.
 &HT;    Mike Gabbard, chairman of Hawaii's Alliance for Traditional
Marriage, says ''The majority of people are opposed to homosexual
marriage. Its supporters are trying to force their values on people
of the community. I am a former educator. I don't want to see the
curricula and textbooks changed to teach that homosexuality is on
an equal basis with heterosexuality.''
 &HT;    Kristina Johannes of the Alaska Family Coalition says,
''Homosexuals have a right to privacy. Alaska has no anti-sodomy
law. But in seeking same-sex marriages, they are asking society to
approve of their behavior. Businesses would have to offer spousal
benefits.''
 &HT;    Further, most homosexuals are not interested in same-sex
marriage. Even in San Francisco, which allows such ''marriage''
ceremonies, there have been only 180 of them in a city with 200,000
homosexuals.
 &HT;    What's at stake is a potential undermining of the
Judeo-Christian understanding of what a family is. A traditional
marriage -- providing a stable, loving environment for children --
is the most important and necessary unit of civilization.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    On Election Day, Michigan voters will decide whether to become
the second state to permit physician-assisted suicide as they vote
on ''Proposal B.''
 &HT;    This is the state where Dr. Jack Kevorkian has helped 100 people
commit suicide and where he has been tried for assisted suicide
three times and acquitted. It is also the state where Kevorkian's
lawyer is running for governor.
 &HT;    A few weeks ago, polls revealed a disturbing 48-43 margin of
support for the measure, but more recent polls report 54 percent of
likely voters opposed, thanks to TV ads by religious, medical and
civic leaders.
 &HT;    Similar referenda in Washington State, California and Oregon
were very close. (The Oregon Death With Dignity Act was approved by
voters last November.)
 &HT;    Sadly, Kevorkian's success has already changed how America
thinks and views itself. ''There was a time when we thought that
the highest value was preserving human life,'' says Wesley J.
Smith, author of ''Forced Exit: The Slippery Slope from Assisted
Suicide to Legal Murder.''
 &HT;    ''We no longer do. Now the highest value is allowing people
personal freedom, even if the cause is wanting to kill themselves.
It has changed our very nature as a society. Many people no longer
view suicide as wrong.''
 &HT;    Of course, Kevorkian claimed the people he helped die all had
terminal, acute and painful illnesses. However, autopsies by county
medical examiners of Kevorkian's victims revealed that 80 percent
did NOT have terminal illnesses. Many were not in pain. In fact,
seven victims had nothing physically wrong, but were simply
depressed.
 &HT;    Thus, one flaw of such a law is that many people will be helped
to kill themselves simply because they are depressed, or fear that
they will become a burden to their family.
 &HT;    Another flaw in Proposal B is that medical examiners would be
stripped of their authority to investigate assisted-suicide deaths.
So the opinions of future Dr. Kevorkians could not be contradicted
with scientific evidence that the patient was not close to death.
 &HT;    Further, Proposal B promotes abuse and deception by requiring
physicians to lie on official death certificates, stating that the
cause of death was the person's disease, not suicide.
 &HT;    ''This has the effect of making it more difficult to detect and
prevent the abuses which many fear will accompany the legalization
of physician-assisted suicide,'' says former Oakland County
prosecutor Richard Thompson, a long-time Kevorkian foe. Proposal B
is ''nothing more than a menu for `the perfect murder.'''
 &HT;    There is no requirement in the 12,000-word proposed law that
family members be notified that a relative has been given a lethal
prescription. However, out-of-state family members can travel to
Michigan to receive suicide drugs to kill themselves. How's that
for family values?
 &HT;    Oversight of the law would be given to a committee of 14 doctors
and 3 members of the public, all of whom ''shall not be opposed''
to the measure. By eliminating those opposed to physician-assisted
suicide, Thompson says, ''They have effectively put the fox in
charge of the chicken coop.'' Its meetings and even its written
decisions would not be open to the public. Secrecy is needed to
hide evil.
 &HT;    The Detroit Free Press, which is liberal on many issues,
editorialized: ''Whatever your view of life, death, morality,
medicine or law, if the time ever comes for you or your loved ones
to face such a choice, Proposal B is not the choice you want. Vote
NO on Proposal B.''
 &HT;    Voters in Hawaii and Alaska will vote on another important moral
issue: whether to allow ''marriages'' of same sex couples.
 &HT;    Mike Gabbard, chairman of Hawaii's Alliance for Traditional
Marriage, says ''The majority of people are opposed to homosexual

ceremonies, there have been only 180 of them in a city with 200,000

WHEN A `NEWS FLASH' PRODUCED PANIC 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA BASS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DANVILLE, Calif. _ Friday is the 60th anniversary of the
invasion of the United States by creatures from the planet Mars. On
Oct. 30, 1938, CBS radio announced that a cylinder loaded with
hostile Martians had just landed in a field in central New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The invasion, of course, wasn't real; it was the famous ``The
War of the Worlds'' radio show devised by Orson Welles and his
Mercury Theatre. But while the invasion was illusory, the reaction
was not. Thousands of people, believing the broadcast genuine,
rushed to the streets, clogging highways with mile-long traffic
jams; others called the police and army, swearing they could see
the Martian cylinders and poison gas. Churches overflowed; so did
hospitals and bars. Panic was nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   This panic _ one of the best-known events in U.S. history _ is
troubling. How could people believe Martians had landed? Were our
grandparents really that gullible?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, they weren't; it's easy to see why people believed the
broadcast was real. Although the opening words of the show clearly
stated that this was a radio play ``suggested by the H.G. Wells
novel `The War of the Worlds,''' not everyone tuned in at 8 p.m.
when the show began.
</P>
<P>
   Those who didn't missed the introductory material. Instead, they
came in on a phony ``news flash'' from New Jersey, where a ``huge
cylinder'' had just landed. Suddenly the cylinder opened, and out
crawled a being ``large as a bear,'' with ``saliva dripping from
its rimless lips.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the ``news flash'' broke off and the so-called regular
programming _ piano music from various New York hotels _ returned.
</P>
<P>
   Had this piano music not been played, most likely the ``Mars
attack'' would have alarmed nobody. But in 1938, radio audiences
had become accustomed to news flashes: ``Ladies and gentlemen, we
interrupt this program'' was commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   Five weeks before ``The War of the Worlds,'' Welles' own
broadcast of Sherlock Holmes had been interrupted by a news
bulletin on the Munich crisis. When the piano music came on as the
``real'' show, suddenly the fake ``news bulletin'' seemed real too.
</P>
<P>
   For several minutes the piano music continued, interspersed with
``news flashes,'' hissing sounds and fake static. As the ``news
flashes'' became more alarming, the music grew increasingly
insipid, making the news even more riveting.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly there was a crash, followed by what may be the greatest
sound effect in radio history _ dead silence. Even during a Martian
invasion, everyone knows silence is costly; it was inconceivable
anyone would waste air time on nothing. The invasion had to be
real.
</P>
<P>
   By the time a cheerful voice announced an intermission and
reminded listeners that this was a dramatization, a good portion of
Welles' audience had already hit the streets.
</P>
<P>
   When the truth came out, hysteria turned to embarrassment and
anger. Lawsuits were filed _ sound familiar? _ for everything from
sprained ankles to premature births.
</P>
<P>
   We will never know exactly how many people believed the Martians
had really invaded; we do know, however, that those who did, did so
not because they were gullible fools. Rather, they believed because
they had fallen, unknowingly, under the spell of some excellent
art, presented to them in a friendly and popular medium; they
trusted this medium, and they believed this art to be true.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why, ultimately, Welles' broadcast is still so
troubling. It is a stark testimony, not to gullibility, but to the
power of the media. ``The War of the Worlds'' should remind artists
in every medium to be careful of what they present as truth; it
should also remind consumers of art to be cautious with what we
accept as true.
</P>
<P>
   The image is disturbing: American citizens running through the
streets, pointing hysterically upward. We don't ever want to repeat
it.

`GRANDPA' TAKES ON THE ESTABLISHMENT IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ We know this much:
</P>
<P>
   Whatever else happens on Tuesday, Al Lewis will not be elected
governor of New York. He will not get the chance to turn the
governor's mansion into a day care center. He will not don his
vampire outfit, complete with flowing black cape, and deliver a
thundering inauguration speech denouncing venal, uncaring
establishment politicians.
</P>
<P>
   This much, however, he might do:
</P>
<P>
   He might just get 50,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
   The polls have varied, some showing Lewis pulling as few as
45,000 votes, and some showing him nearer 85,000. If he gets 50,000
people to vote for him on Tuesday, then the Green Party he
represents will become a legal political party in New York. In a
state with the most restrictive election code in America, the
Greens will no longer have to scramble for signatures on nominating
petitions to offer candidates to the public.
</P>
<P>
   In case you haven't heard about any of this, Lewis is a
ferociously funny and fiery 88-year-old New York actor _ beloved to
baby boomers as the Grandpa character on the old television series
``The Munsters'' _ who is carrying the Green Party banner this
year. His running mate for lieutenant governor is Alice Green, a
longtime Albany activist for left-wing causes.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has been having a wonderful time in this campaign. He has
stomped around the state in sandals and white socks, an unlit stub
of a cigar clenched between his teeth, wrapped in an old sport coat
and with a baseball cap fighting a losing battle to contain his
wild gray hair. In that magnificent actor's voice, he has bellowed
against social injustice and launched angry, indignant attacks
against anybody who challenged his views, however mildly.
</P>
<P>
   He also has taken great delight in referring to incumbent
Republican Gov. George Pataki, who's expected to win big on
Tuesday, as a ``potatohead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How does that differ from calling him a putzhead?'' I asked
Lewis the other day.
</P>
<P>
   He would never call anybody a putzhead, he explained. That's an
ethnic term of derision _ used, by the way, by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato
against his opponent, Rep. Charles E. Schumer _ that Lewis deems
offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Potatohead,'' he explained, derives not from an intimate part
of the human body. Instead, it's a polite, descriptive term of
botanical origin. Potatoes grow upside down, Al Lewis said, and he
believes the governor to be a man with his head in the ground, like
a potato, so Pataki doesn't have to gaze upon and confront the
injustice in this society.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is nobody's diplomat, but he's also nobody's fool. He
holds a doctorate from Columbia University. For the past few years,
he has hosted a public affairs talk show on a New York City radio
station. He's an old, committed leftie, but he has always been an
independent, never registered in a conventional political party.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the Greens are nowhere in America, but they're
big in Europe, especially in Germany. To a large degree over there,
the Greens are where the Communists migrated when the Soviet Union
went belly up. The party's basic principles are that humans must be
prevented at all costs from further damaging the environment _
which means tight public control over the means of production _ and
that humanity is divided mainly into innocent, deserving poor and
prosperous, unworthy swine.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the traditional refuge for voters who found the
Democratic Party insufficiently devoted to leftist conviction has
been the Liberal Party, which Lewis condemns as a patronage-drunk
arm of the political establishment.
</P>
<P>
   I asked him, doesn't that happen to every political party once
it gets a little power? Wouldn't that happen to the Greens, too?
</P>
<P>
   Lewis laughed. ``I'm waiting for that moment.''

PEDESTRIANS OF THE WORLD ... UNITE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ This must be what being a war correspondent
feels like. Steel was flying inches away in a conflict that leaves
about 30 people dead and 1,000 injured each year in San Francisco,
and I was just taking notes.
</P>
<P>
   OK, you could say we were just standing on the corner of Van
Ness and Market watching pedestrians and cars go by. But this is
near the top of the list of San Francisco's most dangerous
intersections. It's war every day.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Gnosca, who is disabled and has to walk with crutches, was
cutting through the lower-level passages of the Municipal Railway
instead of trying to cross the street. ``The stoplight doesn't give
you enough time,'' he said, ``and the drivers don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone cares. I had left my safe office because I heard
pedestrians were organizing a ped liberation movement. Only in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   This growing pavement-roots organization is called the San
Francisco Pedestrian Safety Task Force, which hopes to do for
pedestrians what the Bicycle Coalition did for bicyclists in the
city.
</P>
<P>
   These are my people. I tried pacing off the 50 yards across Van
Ness while timing the lights, and almost became a hood ornament
because of my poor concentration and bum knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at that,'' shouted Richard Winn, as a Jetta and an Acura
went around the corner like two slot-car racers.
</P>
<P>
   Look at them? I could feel their slipstreams.
</P>
<P>
   Winn became a pedestrian activist in a natural way, from the
Rescue Muni organization. It all connects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The curb is curved here so it encourages cars to go faster.
That's what traffic engineers think about _ moving cars faster,''
said Howard Strassner, chair of the Pedestrian Safety Task Force.
``They want to have 15,000 cars go through this intersection each
day. That's crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Strassner's group just published its latest list of San
Francisco's most dangerous intersections, most of which were along
Market and Mission streets.
</P>
<P>
   I counted 15 intersections on the ``dirty dozen'' list, but
there are so many dangerous intersections in San Francisco it's
easy to lose count.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's another creeper,'' said Shirley Bierly, referring to a
Thunderbird edging through pedestrians. The driver was making a
right turn on red from Van Ness onto Market just past the offices
of the Department of Parking and Traffic and a ``No turn on red''
sign.
</P>
<P>
   Bierly runs a senior citizens group called Senior Power (motto:
``Growing old rebelliously''), which a few years ago helped make
the intersection safer at Fourth and Howard in front of senior
housing.
</P>
<P>
   She counted six ``creepers'' in 10 minutes, including one taxi
that almost ran down a guy in a wheelchair. She also counted nine
jaywalkers.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, they all survived their suicide attempts.
</P>
<P>
   The pedestrian movement includes citizens such as Norman Rolfe,
who joined because ``I came damn near to being killed every day.''
</P>
<P>
   It includes bicyclists such as Maggie Robbins from the San
Francisco Bicycle Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like everyone else, I'm multimodal,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, she went into bicycle mode, though, defending a
bicyclist who slalomed like an Extreme Games champ through
pedestrians while making an illegal turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did it safely,'' she said, pointing to a car that was
simultaneously making an illegal right turn. ``It's cars that kill
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, why focus on potential fractures in the
bicyclist-pedestrian coalition? The potential fractures all of us
can get from cars are worse.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins said she'd like to see a person-on-the-sidewalk traffic
survey. ``Ask people how many miles they walk each month, and how
many times they've felt their lives threatened.''
</P>
<P>
   Lives threatened per month? How about per half-hour?
</P>
<P>
   The ped power activists at Market and Van Ness had a few
suggestions for improving the intersection. People could get more
than 40 seconds to make it across the eight lanes.
</P>
<P>
   There could be a little safety island on the median where the
old, infirm, young and slow could take refuge. Corners could stick
out more so cars couldn't take them like Le Mans, and pedestrians
could get a head start.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, cops could give tickets to all the potential
murderers screeching around corners, through red lights and
violating the 25 mph speed limit _ that's what it is, believe it or
not.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, on Tuesday morning, a police task force was making a
sweep of the homeless a few blocks away near Sixth Street's skid
row, where no one has ever been killed by a fast-moving shopping
cart.
</P>
<P>
   How come shopping carts are treated as bigger hazards than
fast-moving Detroit iron? How come the dangerous right-turn-on-red
won't be repealed? Just because Woody Allen thought it was
California's greatest contribution to the world?
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to run us off the road because they have all the
power,'' said longtime pedestrian activist Bob Planthold, who gets
around on bright yellow crutches, all the better to be seen, and
all the better to wave at drivers who choose not to see him.
</P>
<P>
   Power to the peds.

NEW SILICON VALLEY MUSEUM FOCUSES ON TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ A new museum in the Silicon Valley
demonstrates the contributions technology has made to science, and
does so with dazzling hands-on displays.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not going to be a trade show,'' said Peter B. Giles,
president of the 130,000-square-foot Tech Museum of Innovation.
``We are not going to do the logo thing.''
</P>
<P>
   That means showcasing technology ``as the means, not the end,''
said exhibit director Wayne LaBar, who said the museum _ which
opens Saturday _ strives for ``the wow factor.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum is divided into galleries on technology and the human
body, communication, exploration and computing power.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 400 displays is a 7,700-gallon tank, in which visitors
maneuver a deep-ocean robot with joysticks. An on-board camera
displays what the robot sees on a nearby monitor.
</P>
<P>
   There's a high-tech operating room that allows visitors to play
doctor, using a remote forceps to conduct a coronary bypass though
a small hole in a patient's chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do is inspire people _ especially kids _
by showing the end results of innovation,'' Giles said. ``We're not
going to be an advertisement for anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tech, as the museum is being called, is the second
incarnation of a Silicon Valley museum. The first, called ``The
Garage,'' located on the same block in downtown San Jose, was what
Giles called ``a dress rehearsal'' for The Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ironed out all the kinks,'' Giles said. Those kinks
included size _ The Tech is six times larger than The Garage _ and
the stand-still collections of silicon chips and other high-tech
paraphernalia.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the mango- and azure-colored museum is a huge
IMAX theater with a 360-degree screen.

LAUGHTER'S BEST MEDICINE MAN 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Dave Barry pauses over an egg breakfast at the
Huntington Hotel to sum up what is great about turning 50.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year I care a little less about what people think of me,
and whether I'm doing what everyone else wants me to do,'' he says
thoughtfully, waving a fork. ``Which is a big important step for me
because I think one reason I became a humor columnist in the first
place is feelings of insecurity and inferiority, and wanting
everyone's approval.''
</P>
<P>
   Chafing at the seriousness of his words, Barry _ who is actually
51 _ quickly explodes with chuckles. ``But everything else about
turning 50 sucks! Everything hurts! You can't see well! You're
clueless about what's happening, and everyone else looks so
YOUNG.''
</P>
<P>
   But if you're expecting a tragic screed on a mid-life crisis,
don't look to Barry, whose new book _ ``Dave Barry Turns 50'' _ is
more evidence that the Miami Herald's Pulitzer Prize-winning
newspaper columnist and author of nearly 20 books can find the
humor in pretty much anything. And that he does not intend to go
even slightly gently into that good night.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Dave Barry Turns 50,'' the King of the Boomers provides
those getting close to the Big Five-Oh with tips on looking young
(avoid medical care, try cosmetic surgery if you're brave and when
all else fails, ``shoot the mirror''); sending your child to
college (chapter subtitle: ``You Don't Need Both Your Kidneys!'');
and planning for retirement (move in with someone you supported in
previous years _ your former congressperson.)
</P>
<P>
   Barry could have also called this book ``Dave Barry Rewrites
History,'' because he gives his own patented version of the five
decades since his birth, starting in the late 40s and moving
forward. Everyone from Buffalo Bob to Spiro Agnew gets the Barry
treatment; trends are combed for riotous new spins, from Hula Hoops
(``In terms of intellectual content ... made the Frisbee look like
international championship chess'') to experimentation with
psychedelics like LSD.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally, being college students,'' he writes, ``we did not
rush out and take a powerful, potentially harmful drug that we knew
nothing about simply because (Timothy Leary) told us to. No sir.
First we asked some hard questions, such as: `Where can we get
some?' Then we rushed out and took it.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry's light-hearted, Everyman humor and what-me-worry grin
have evoked comparisons with Mark Twain and Will Rogers. But all
that makes him uncomfortable. Because at the core, Barry is just a
ink-stained daily scribe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a little weird, the attention. I am a newspaper person.
So is my wife (sportswriter Michelle Kaufman), and most of our
friends. Don't forget I started out at a paper where if someone
grew a potato that looked like Dwight Eisenhower it was considered
front-page news!''
</P>
<P>
   ``So when I go to cover a major event like the Olympics or a
political convention, I take my note pad and get ready to write,
but then I end up getting interviewed! And I don't like that. I
became a columnist so I could sit back and make fun of things and
not be on the other end of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry's visibility increased tenfold with the debut in 1993 of
``Dave's World,'' a sitcom starring Harry Anderson and based on
Barry's life. (Although Barry admits to having had very little to
do with it.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I did have one minor role _ playing A Guy That Can't Act. And
I got a little worried when the series got canceled that I might
have to die or something in real life.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his allergy to the spotlight, Barry has learned how to
play the book tour game, from sitting gamely for photo sessions
(with flaming cupcakes no less), to doing TV interviews and
greeting fans _ more than 1,000 turned out in Seattle recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my favorite part,'' he confesses. ``I love interacting
with readers. But these tours are basically asking writers to
become salespeople. And every writer I know _ except self-help book
writers who are shameless pond scum for the most part _ finds that
really awkward. Most writers are insecure and really just want to
say, `Oh, you don't have to spend your hard-earned money on
THIS.'''
</P>
<P>
   Barry says he stays young by playing hoops with his 18-year-old
son, and by playing the occasional gig (book conventions mostly) in
the much-ballyhooed all-author rock band, The Rock-Bottom
Remainders _ a publishing term for books that don't sell. Among the
rotating band members: Amy Tan, Roy Blount Jr. (``he calls us
`hard-listening,''' quips Barry), Stephen King, Kathy Goldmark,
Ridley Pearson, and Barbara Kingsolver once upon a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really bad, but we have so much fun it's ridiculous,''
he says. ``We do it for charity and as Amy says, `Man, this is so
cool I'd do it to KILL some whales!'''
</P>
<P>
   Barry is clearly adjusting well to life at 50. What does he have
to say to those about to take that leap? He smiles. ``Turn back!
Don't go any further. And try to laugh.''

<P>
   MOSCOW _ They were young and upwardly mobile Russians enjoying
all that the post-Soviet economy had to offer the fledgling middle
class.
</P>
<P>
   Thriving in Russia's new capitalism, Alexander and Lilia
Kazintsev spent their hard-earned rubles on stylish furnishings for
their apartment and country house, vacations abroad and a private
tutor to teach English to their nine-year-old son, Anton.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the good times have vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander lost his well-paying job as a corporate marketing
director. Lilia believes her layoff as an executive headhunter is
just a matter of time. Their savings have been frozen in a Moscow
bank.
</P>
<P>
   Any hopes of a brighter future are on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of families like the Kazintsevs were the first
victims of Russia's economic meltdown in late August, when the
ruble plummeted in value and the banking system collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us who had jobs, money -- the means to travel, buy
clothes, good food and wine -- in one moment, we have lost all
these opportunities,'' said Lilia, 33.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies these days don't need marketing managers, they need
crisis managers,'' said Alexander, also 33.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, both both Russian and foreign companies have been laying
people off by the hundreds. Multinational advertising giant BBDO
has laid off one-third of its staff, while Pizza Hut announced
plans earlier this week to close its two restaurants in Moscow. A
recent survey of its membership by the American Chamber of Commerce
here showed that half of its members have either laid off or
reduced salaries to workers because of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The events have sent shockwaves though Russia's middle class, a
tiny minority -- perhaps no more than several million in a country
of 147 million -- who successfully made the transformation from
communism to capitalism after the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, they live in Russia's two largest cities, Moscow and St.
Petersburg. Not the much-publicized mafia and not the ultra-rich
tycoons, Russia's middle class -- like the Kazintsevs -- consists
of the business professionals and entrepreneurs who adopted a
Western lifestyle. They bought and renovated their Soviet-built
apartments, purchased cars, frequented restaurants, joined health
clubs and sent their children to private schools.
</P>
<P>
   In good times, they earned 20 or even 200 times more than the
average Russian salary of $200 a month by taking their Soviet-style
economic and management training and conforming it to the new
reality.
</P>
<P>
   Their plight in the current economic crisis is not as dire as
the majority of poverty-stricken Russians.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people living below the poverty line rose from
32.8 million in August to 44.4 million in September, about 30
percent of the population, according to official statistics. The
poverty line is drawn at the ruble equivalent of $32 a month.
</P>
<P>
   But more important for the country's future, the middle class
was the great hope for the staying power of democracy and reforms:
How are you going to send them back to the Soviet days after
they've seen cable TV and Disney World?
</P>
<P>
   But the material gains of recent years are indeed slipping away
and the future looks gloomy, particularly as the government
contemplates enacting Soviet-style controls on the economy to get
through the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not buy new clothes, shoes, furniture. We do not buy what
isn't necessary for living,'' said Lilia.
</P>
<P>
   For them, the hardest is explaining the setback to their little
boy, Anton. No more vacations at the beach in Turkey; no more
private lessons to learn English in the hopes of giving him an edge
in his later education.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we're in the shops, we have to tell him why we cannot buy
the toy he wants. It is too expensive now,'' Alexander said.
</P>
<P>
   They are not alone. By year's end, more than 200,000 of the
middle class will be unemployed in Moscow alone, according to the
city's employment center.
</P>
<P>
   A recent nationwide survey showed that of those with jobs only
18 percent of Russians are being paid regularly, and some 56
percent said they must rely on food they have grown on their own
and stockpiled to survive the coming winter.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a three-piece herringbone suit, an executive's
leather briefcase by his side, Alexander scanned the want ads on a
recent afternoon and lamented the setback to his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem really isn't with money. It's not in the things I
can buy or cannot buy. The problem is that my career prospects have
crashed,'' said Alexander, who conceded he may have to consider a
job as a driver or a laborer.
</P>
<P>
   Their savings have been frozen in a Moscow bank since August,
and they hope to get by with help from family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   Lilia, who was a university lecturer in philosophy before the
Soviet Union collapsed, approaches their plight with a degree of
wisdom, not anger.
</P>
<P>
   It is a stoicism shared by many Russians who have lived through
similar economic upheavals over the past decade, watching their
savings wiped out and their buying power eroded as banks fail and
inflation runs rampant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose to be angry is not a constructive emotion,'' she
said. ``It's a pity, but we have a habit of living under difficult
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the first crisis for us,'' Alexander said. ``It's
just the latest crisis.''

   VIGNIER, Haiti _ Barricade after barricade blocked traffic along
National Road 1, a ribbon of despair and poverty that cuts from
northwest Haiti to the capital of Port-au-Prince.
</P>
<P>
   Poor peasants in this dusty village had stacked the stones and
branches shoulder-high before dawn, and they burned tires that shot
clouds of black smoke toward the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions mounted when angry onlookers hurled rocks at police
officers who tried to disperse the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Into the air, a gunshot was fired, and the sound sent people
scattering for cover in all directions.
</P>
<P>
   It was a protest, Haitian-style, one of many that have been held
in recent weeks, staged by a disillusioned population that has
little to celebrate despite four years of democratic rule.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, U.S. troops overthrew a brutal dictatorship and
restored exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power.
</P>
<P>
   But unless something gives, this country could easily tumble
into a spiral of violence and upheaval that would bring to a
screeching halt any and all efforts to shore up the embryonic
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things seem to be getting worse, and no one cares what is
happening,'' said John Ilfrin, a resident of this town located an
hour's drive from Port-au-Prince. ``We have only one phone in this
village, and no water or electricity.''
</P>
<P>
   Frustration also is building in Washington, which has poured an
estimated $1 billion into this Maryland-sized country of 8 million
people since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The United States still maintains a force of some 500 soldiers
here to do humanitarian chores such as repairing roads and
operating a medical clinic.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has requested $140 million in aid to
Haiti for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 -- double the previous
year's amount.
</P>
<P>
   A parade of U.S. emissaries has been sent here to break the
political gridlock that has left Haiti without a working government
for 17 months, but none have made progress.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has visited Haiti twice
since October 1997.
</P>
<P>
   And, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton has scheduled a visit to
Haiti in mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are no signs that conditions will improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conditions have gone from bad to worse, and there is clearly
great desperation among the Haitian people,'' said Ken Boodhoo(CQ),
an expert on Haiti at Florida International University in Miami who
recently visited the country. ``The only reason more of them are
not headed to Florida is that many have run out of wood to build
boats.''
</P>
<P>
   Just last month(CQ), two Coast Guard cutters repatriated 462
Haitians who were caught near the Bahamas on an overcrowded wooden
freighter bound for Florida. So far this year, the Coast Guard has
intercepted 1,158 Haitians. Compared to last year, the number is
up, but the flow has slowed considerably since tens of thousands
fled a murderous regime in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But in a poll of 1,400 Haitians conducted last August by the
U.S. Embassy here, nearly three-fourths of those surveyed said they
would leave Haiti if they could.
</P>
<P>
   And nearly 40 percent believe Haitians will turn away from
democracy if conditions don't improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our economic situation has never been worse,'' said Lovinsky
Pierre-Antoine, an official with Haiti's National Migration Office.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the economy has scarcely changed in four decades
that have seen the murderous tyrannies of Francois ``Papa Doc''
Duvalier and his son, Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier; the
dictatorial rule of military juntas; the election, ouster and
return of Aristide; and the reign of the current president,
Aristide's hand-picked successor, Rene Preval.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there is little that works in this land of idyllic
beaches and banana plants.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic lights don't function. Driver's licenses aren't
dispensed. Phone service can be out for months following a heavy
rain.
</P>
<P>
   Desperation is evident in the faces of the beggars who claw at
the windows of any foreigner's car that tries to leave the
airport's parking lot, and in those of children who clutch tattered
clothes around bone-thin bodies as they play in the open sewers
that twist through the slums.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment is at 60-plus percent, while per-capita income has
fallen to about $250 a year.
</P>
<P>
   In September, when the United Nations published its annual
``human development index,'' Haiti, already the poorest nation in
the hemisphere, had dropped to 159th in the world. It had ranked
124th only a few years ago, when Aristide was first elected to
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The continuing political deadlock poses considerable risks to
the country's fragile democracy,'' warned U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan in his latest quarterly report to the General Assembly.
``It is a serious impediment to economic development and
international assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   The origins of the current crisis go back to June 1997, when
Prime Minister Rosny Smarth resigned over allegations of rigged
elections that April, a move that has left Haiti without a
functioning government for nearly 17 months.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently the stalemate has forced parliamentary and
municipal elections scheduled for this month(CQ) to be indefinitely
postponed.
</P>
<P>
   Preval has nominated four people to replace Smarth, but the
first three were rejected by the Haitian Parliament, while his most
recent nominee, Minister of Education Jacques-Edouard Alexis, has
yet to win approval.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Preval has been unable to collect hundreds of
millions of dollars in aid, or even to get a budget approved so
that civil servants who've not gotten a salary in months might
finally receive a paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lack of a prime minister and a fully empowered government
has put economic (aid) and social progress on hold because
necessary legislation can't be introduced and enacted into law,''
said Mary Ellen Gilroy, a spokeswoman at the U.S. Embassy in
Port-au-Prince.
</P>
<P>
   The Parliament, unable to reach a quorum, also hasn't been able
to pass important legislation that might be used to fight rising
crime and drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials now estimate that 15 percent -- about four tons a
month -- of all cocaine entering the United States transits Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political infrastructure is totally lacking,'' said Mike
Vigil, who heads the Drug Enforcement Administration's Caribbean
office in Puerto Rico. ``We have virtually no response capability
at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of rising crime was recently brought home to Americans
when, on Oct. 21, five men robbed a ``Dateline NBC'' television
crew, including correspondent Lea Thompson, at gunpoint in
Port-au-Prince as a police officer looked on.
</P>
<P>
   With limited resources and limited training, Haitian officials
say it's been tough to build a capable police force with 6,000
mostly young, inexperienced members.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it's true that the number of political killings may have
declined, so many cops are now being bought out by drug traffickers
that it's my impression the police force has gone to hell,'' said
Sarah DeCosse of Human Rights Watch in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Preval, widely regarded as a respectable leader, but lacking in
Aristide's charisma and ability to communicate, declined a request
from Cox News Service for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the one piece of good news here is that, somehow,
this country keeps running, seemingly on automatic pilot.
</P>
<P>
   By 6 a.m., Haitians are out on the streets hawking everything
from limes to fabric, light bulbs to Tabasco sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Luxurious houses have been constructed. Car dealerships have
been expanded. Road work has been undertaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the political problems, money is still being invested
in this country, and there is some real growth in many areas,''
said Alex Knowles, head of the Haitian-American Chamber of Commerce
here.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that U.S. companies such as Atlanta-based Coca-Cola
Co. have pumped money into this impoverished country.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola and its local bottler invested at least $15 million in
production and distribution systems in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some strong years there,'' said Rob Baskin, a
Coca-Cola spokesman, referring to a 74 percent increase in sales
since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But the political impasse has clearly hurt the economy, which is
expected to grow by a paltry 1 percent to 2 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   With no immediate end to the political stalemate in sight, all
eyes now seem to be focused on presidential elections in the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Aristide, the populist priest, is widely expected to run, and is
favored to win.
</P>
<P>
   But there also have been muted calls for Duvalier to return from
exile in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Adding even more uncertainty to the mix is the fact that a
10-year constitutional ban that has kept most key players in
Duvalier's regime from running for political office ended last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Aristide sounds and acts a lot like a presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent visit to Miami, he pledged in a speech to work for
peace in Haiti and promised to push for dual citizenship for those
who want to vote in both the United States and Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is no food in our stomachs, it is hard to have peace
in our minds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His message plays well in Haiti, where ``Viv Aristide'' graffiti
is scrawled on buildings everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But the question of whether Haiti can hold together for two more
years remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will there be violence, or will there be an uprising?'' asked
Ernest Preeg, U.S. ambassador to Haiti from 1981 to 1983. ``No one
can say, but the potential is certainly there.''

<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ As Hurricane Mitch churned through the
Caribbean this week, a clearer picture is emerging of the
destruction imposed by Hurricane Georges on the hemisphere's
poorest country little more than a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of cardboard homes in the squalid slums that surround
this capital city have been washed away.
</P>
<P>
   The southeastern border town of Fonds Verrettes nearly wiped
out, killing more than 100 residents.
</P>
<P>
   And in central Haiti, 20 inches of rain dumped by Georges
devastated crops in the Artibonite Valley, the breadbasket of a
nation that can't feed itself even in good times.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in this country have suffered so much and so long that
it seems particularly unjustified that they have had to suffer
through this storm,'' said U.S. Agency for International
Development Administrator Brian Atwood, who visited Haiti last
month(CQ).
</P>
<P>
   Georges ripped through the eastern Caribbean and the Florida
Keys in late September, pummeling island after island like a
violent enemy looking for vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   The storm killed more than 500 people and inflicted more than $5
billion in property damage before making its exit as an innocuous
fall rainstorm over Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   But hardest hit was Hispaniola, an island shared by Haiti and
the Dominican Republic, two countries ill-prepared for a natural
disaster of such magnitude.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of Georges, the Haitian government said a
combination of mudslides and flooding killed more than 200 people,
left another 332,136 homeless and killed 56,828 animals.
Agricultural damage is estimated at $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Port-au-Prince, Haiti's bustling capital and
home to 3 million people, wasn't affected by the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   But in other parts of Haiti, the country's extreme poverty put
it at the mercy of Georges even moreso than other nations ravaged
by the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   The storm aggravated an already precarious economy, weak
agricultural production, and a deteriorated network of roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``In such a poor country, the economic effect is going to be
greater than it would be elsewhere,'' said Alex Knowles, head of
the Haitian-American Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the effect really won't be felt for another three or four
months,'' he said. ``That's when prices will start rising as more
food has to be imported.''
</P>
<P>
   An unfortunate by-product of the storm is a drop in attendance
at some schools by as much as 30 percent. With Georges wiping out
crops, many parents couldn't come up with the money needed to pay
for enrollment last month(CQ), the start of the new school year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another by-product, with the United States bearing the brunt
of it, will undoubtedly be increased illegal migration and drug
trafficking -- which were already growing concerns for U.S.
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think you'd see more Haitians trying to get to the
United States because of miserable conditions,'' said Ken Boodhoo,
an expert on Haiti at Florida International University in Miami.
``And, because of poor communication, I am sure the extent of the
hurricane's damage isn't even known yet.''
</P>
<P>
   According to an AID report on the hurricane, escalating prices,
increased food shortages, and widespread hunger are expected as the
traditional flow of food supplies falls far short of already low
historical levels during the next nine months to a year.
</P>
<P>
   Tempering that sentiment are U.S. observers saying the
government here responded faster, surprisingly, than the government
in the neighboring Dominican Republic, a better-developed country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bright spot in all this has been the efforts by the
Haitians themselves to provide relief and set up shelters,'' said
Phyllis Forbes, director of AID in Haiti.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: I requested tickets to Masters practice rounds some time ago.
When will the notices be mailed so I can find out if I will get
them?
</P>
<P>
   A: The responses already have gone out, said Glenn Greenspan of
Augusta (Ga.) National Golf Club. If you didn't receive anything,
that means you won't be getting tickets, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw a brief report on TV news that singer Levi Stubbs of
the group Tops, formerly known as the Four Tops, was missing. But I
didn't hear or read anything else about it. Do you have any
information?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was a false alarm, started when Stubbs' relatives in
Michigan reported to police in late September that he had gone to
Southern California on business, then checked out of his hotel and
wasn't heard from. But Los Angeles police said they were contacted
by another member of the singing group, Abdul ``Duke'' Fakir, who
told them Stubbs had simply checked into a different hotel and
hadn't talked with his family in the interim. The singer is fine,
Fakir told Detroit radio station WWJ, so police on Sept. 25
officially called off the search for Stubbs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do I remember correctly that Sen. John Glenn once made a run
for the presidency?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. In April 1983, Glenn, a frequent critic of President
Ronald Reagan's foreign and domestic policies, became a candidate
for the 1984 Democratic nomination. But he quit the race after
failing to win any early primary or caucus elections.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard that there is a list of the ``12 most effective
preachers in the English language.'' Who were they, and who drew up
the list?
</P>
<P>
   A. The list of preachers was compiled by Milton Cunningham of
Baylor University in, Waco, Texas, in 1996, after surveying 1,500
preachers and teachers. The 12 are: Walter J. Burghardt, senior
fellow, Woodstock Theological Center, Washington, D.C. (Catholic);
Fred Craddock, professor emeritus, Candler School of Theology,
Emory University, Atlanta (Disciples of Christ); James Forbes,
senior minister, Riverdale Church, New York (Baptist); Billy
Graham, Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, Montreat, N.C.
(Baptist); Thomas Long, professor, Princeton Theological Seminary,
Princeton, N.J. (Presbyterian); Lloyd Ogilvie, U.S. Senate chaplain
and former pastor of the First Presbyterian Church, Hollywood,
Calif. (Presbyterian); Haddon Robinson, professor, Gordon-Conwell
Theological Seminary, South Hamilton, Mass. (Baptist); John R.
Stott, rector emeritus, All Souls Church and president of the
London Institute for Contemporary Christianity, London (Anglican);
Charles Swindoll, president, Dallas Theological Seminary, Dallas
(Evangelical Free Church); Barbara Brown Taylor of Piedmont
College, Demorest, Ga. (Episcopalian); Gardner C. Taylor, pastor
emeritus, Concord Baptist Church of Christ, Brooklyn, N.Y.
(Baptist); and William Willimon, dean of the chapel, Duke
University, Durham, N.C. (Methodist).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Operation Rescue is in the news for opposing what it calls
pornographic books being sold by some Barnes and Noble outlets. How
can I contact them? Also, how do I write to Barnes and Noble?
</P>
<P>
   A: Write or call Operation Rescue at P.O. Box 740066, Dallas, TX
75374 (972-494-5316). Contact the bookstore's headquarters: Barnes
and Noble Inc., 122 Fifth Ave., New York, NY 10011 (212-633-3300).
</P>
<P>
   Q: An item in the Sept. 6 issue of Parade magazine said there
are eight survivors of the cast of ``Gone With the Wind,'' but only
seven were listed. Who is the eighth?
</P>
<P>
   A: Parade's Christie Emden said this name was inadvertently
omitted: Mary Anderson, who played Maybelle Merriwether, ``a minor
character.'' For those who missed the item, these are the other
survivors: Olivia de Havilland, 82, who played Melanie Hamilton;
Evelyn Keyes, 78, and Ann Rutherford, 77, who portrayed Scarlett
O'Hara's sisters, Suellen and Carreen; Fred Crane, 77, one of the
Tarleton twins; Alicia Rhett, 80, who was India Wilkes; Rand
Brooks, 78, Melanie's brother Charles Hamilton; and Cammie King,
64, who was little Bonnie Blue Butler.
</P>
<P>
   Q: While I was teaching sex education to my ninth grade health
class, a student asked me about the phrase ``birds and bees.'' Can
you shed any light on its origin?
</P>
<P>
   A: Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins traces how the
phrase became a euphemism for sex to these verses by Samuel Taylor
Coleridge: ``All nature seems at work. . . . The bees are stirring
_ birds are on the wing . . . and I the while, the sole unbusy
thing, not honey make, nor pair, nor build, nor sing.'' In past
times, when schools touched on such matters _ which was seldom _
sex usually was handled in classes with titles such as Hygiene or
Health. The facts of reproduction of the speces were presented by
analogy, telling how birds ``do it'' and trusting that the
youngsters would get the message by indirection.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm a fan of old musicals. What can you tell me about Deanna
Durbin and Jose Iturbi? Were they ever in a movie together? What
has become of them?
</P>
<P>
   A: They were contemporaries in their film careers, but they
didn't appear together in a movie. _ Durbin was born in 1921,
Iturbi in 1896. Durbin, a singer, was 13 when she made her screen
debut in a short, ``Every Sunday Afternoon.'' She then made a
series of feature films between 1936 and 1947. She married producer
Charles-Henri David and they left Hollywood for Europe shortly
after World War II. It was reported last year that they still live
in a village near Paris. She was described as a ``beautiful woman,
slender, blue-eyed, always smiling, with wavy, shoulder-length
hair.'' She once was quoted as saying, ``Deanna Durbin was a
fairytale character who ceased to exist decades ago,'' and she
neither poses for photos nor grants interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish-born Iturbi, who became famous as a conductor and
concert pianist, created a sensation in February 1941when he played
Lizst's Piano Concerto in E-flat while, at the same time,
conducting the Philadelphia Orchestra at New York's Carnegie Hall.
``He had his audience at his mercy,'' a New York Times critic
wrote. In July 1941he was back in the news when he refused to
appear on the same program with Benny Goodman, saying he didn't
want to mix jazz and classical piano music. Iturbi made at least
eight films between1942 and 1956. He died of a heart attack in Los
Angeles in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently updated readers on Barbara Jane Mackle, who was
kidnapped and buried alive in 1968 before being rescued several
days later. Didn't Gary Steven Krist, her kidnapper, after being
released from prison, move to Sitka, Alaska, and get elected mayor?
Does anyone know what has become of him since then?
</P>
<P>
   A: Krist, who was sentenced in May 1969 to life in prison for
the kidnapping, was paroled in 1979 and returned to his native
Sitka, where he worked for his family's fishing business for a
time. Although previously published articles said Krist went on to
be elected Sitka's mayor, Orriene First Denslow, administrator of
the Sitka Historical Society, told Q&AMP;A that wasn't so. Sitka's
present mayor, Stan Filler, confirmed that Krist never was mayor,
but added that he had returned to Sitka ``after he got into
trouble,'' got married, bought a fishing boat and ``fished around''
before leaving again.
</P>
<P>
   News reports published in 1993 said Krist attended medical
schools in Mexico and in Grenada after leaving Alaska for the
second time. The latter school sent him to train at a Connecticut
hospital, where he was recognized in 1991. Krist readily admitted
his past, saying he had nothing to hide because he had paid his
debt to society, but he resigned. An official of St. George's
Medical School in Grenada told a reporter in 1993 that Krist was
involved in litigation with the school and his records had been
sealed. The official referred inquiries to a New York lawyer, who
didn't return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Krist appears to have dropped out of public view since then,
with no further reports of his whereabouts or activities.
``Everybody just sort of lost track of him,'' said Filler.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Both the Army and Air Force football teams are in conferences
now. Are there any plans for the Navy team to join one?
</P>
<P>
   A: Although a majority of Navy's teams, including basketball,
are in the Patriot League, Eric Ruden of the Naval Academy said
there are no plans for its football team to join a conference.
Conversations have been held with Conference USA, Ruden added, but
for now the team will remain independent. He left the door open for
the possibility of a future change, however, saying, ``You never
know.''

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: ``You never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently stated that all Mississippi casinos must be on
water, with the exception of Indian reservation casinos. What about
the ones in Tunica, such as Sam's Town? It doesn't touch water at
all. Nor does the Hollywood or Harrah's. How do they get around the
law?
</P>
<P>
   A: Look closely and you'll see that they indeed do touch water,
insists Charles Patton, executive director of the Mississippi
Gaming Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the deal, so to speak. Mississippi law requires casinos
to be on the Mississippi River, or on areas that once were part of
the Mississippi, according to Patton. They also can be on
Mississippi RIver tributaries, or on the Gulf of Mexico, but in all
cases they're on water. Since it's sometimes risky for boats to be
on water, the state permits casino operators to tunnel away from
the river for protection, filling in land behind them. ``So they do
appear to be on land, but they're really not,'' Patton says.``If
you look, you can see water around the edge, some more than
others.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, only the casino itself must be on water. Related hotels
and other structures are on dry land. So to a casual observer
looking at the gaming complexes from a distance, the water may not
be readily apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Before the first game of the World Series, Tony Bennett sang
``America the Beautiful.'' Why did he sing that, instead of the
national anthem? And what happened to Robert Merrill, who by
tradition sings the national anthem at Yankees games?
</P>
<P>
   A: Bennett, who grew up in Astoria, Queens, was tapped by Major
League Baseball commissioner Bud Selig because, in Selig's view,
he's better known than former opera star Merrill. On Bennett's
decision to perform a song other than ``The Star-Spangled Banner,''
Rich Levin, spokesman for Major League Baseball, said simply, ``It
is his preference.'' As reported in the New York Daily News, it was
the first time anyone could remember a Yankee game starting without
the national anthem. Merrill, 75, long considered a good-luck charm
by Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, admitted that he was
disappointed by the turn of events. ``I've been doing it, for what,
28 years now? I have brought (the Yankees) luck every time.
Playoffs. Pennants. World Series. Well, now they are on their
own.'' Merrill sang the national anthem before the second game, by
the way. Apparently it was all the luck the Yankees needed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If someone who is testifying in court objects to swearing on
the Bible, what happens?
</P>
<P>
   A: A person who opposes swearing by an oath using the Bible can
take an affirmation, which binds them to the truth just as
strongly. If a person knowingly violates an affirmation, he or she
becomes guilty of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's up with the name of San Diego's Qualcomm Stadium?
Where does that come from?
</P>
<P>
   A: Qualcomm is a San Diego-based high-tech company. When it
opened in 1969, the stadium was simply San Diego Stadium. It was
renamed in 1980 for Jack Murphy, sports editor of the San Diego
Union, who in the mid-1960s began campaigning for a facility to
house the pro football Chargers and a baseball expansion team. In
1997 it was renamed once again, this time to Qualcomm, in return
for the company's donation of $18 million to complete an expansion
project.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Every time I open a bottle of medicine, I'm reminded that the
reason for all the protective packaging was the Tylenol scare in
the late '70s or early '80s. Was the perpetrator ever caught?
</P>
<P>
   A: Seven people in the Chicago area died in 1982 after taking
Tylenol capsules laced with cyanide. No one was ever charged with
the murders, but law enforcement authorities said the prime suspect
was James W. Lewis, an out-of-work accountant involved in an
earlier credit card fraud and linked to a 1978 Kansas City murder.
In the Kansas City case, murder charges were dropped and Lewis was
released when a judge ruled that evidence was improperly seized.
Lewis and his wife then moved to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   In the Tylenol case, Lewis was convicted of extortion and
sentenced to 20 years in prison in 1983 after police found his
fingerprint on a letter to Johnson &AMP; Johnson, the parent company of
Tylenol manufacturer McNeil Consumer Products Co., demanding $1
million to ``stop the killing.'' After serving 13 years of his
sentence, Lewis was released from prison and was last reported to
have settled in East Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The notorious Tylenol scare prompted dramatic changes in the way
almost all food and medical products are packaged, leading to
plasic seals on almost all consumer items that are meant to be
ingested.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If more Democrats are elected to the House, enough to
outnumber Republicans, would that put Newt Gingrich out as speaker?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Here's how it works. The speaker is officially elected
by the full House, but actually already has been chosen at a
meeting of the majority party. The House election simply confirms
the majority party's choice, because representatives support their
party's candidates for leadership positions. So, in your scenario,
if Democrats outnumber Republicans in the House, they will choose a
Democrat as their candidate for speaker, and the full House will
elect him because Democrats would have the votes. The minority
party's candidate for speaker becomes the minority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Q: At a briefing on Birmingham, Ala., and Atlanta bombing
suspect Eric Robert Rudolph, it was mentioned that he once had
served in the Army. Can you expand on that?
</P>
<P>
   A: Portions of Rudolph's military records were released in
February by the National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis.
They showed that he served 18 months in the Army, some of it with
the 101st Airborne Division, before being discharged in 1988.
Officials at first wouldn't disclose the type of discharge Rudolph
received, but initial indications were that it was less than
honorable because he served only 1 1/2 years of a four-year
enlistment. Later reports said he was discharged for substance
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Rep. Cynthia McKinney (D-Ga.) issued a statement ridiculing
the Pentagon for requesting $50 million to provide military
personnel and retirees with Viagra. I'd like to send her a message
saying ``bravo.'' What is her e-mail address?
</P>
<P>
   A: Her address on the Internet: cymck(at)mail.house.gov
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can we help the ethnic Albanian refugees displaced by
months of fighting in Kosovo? An article Sunday painted a grim
picture about them, especially the children, as winter approaches.
Is any place accepting donations?
</P>
<P>
   A: The international relief and development organization CARE is
accepting donations and, in fact, has launched an emergency appeal
to support relief projects in the Kosovo region. CARE is operating
a mobile medical program for about 12,500 refugees and is appealing
for money to buy winter equipment such as children's clothing,
heating stoves, blankets, cooking sets and material to repair
shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Those interested can make donations three ways: by mail, to
CARE, 151 Ellis St. N.E., Atlanta, GA 30303; by phone (with
donations charged to credit cards), 1-800-521-2273; or online (also
with donations charged to credit cards), at
http:www.care.org/getinvolved
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that a meteor shower is expected soon.What are
the dates?
</P>
<P>
   A: As it does every November, Earth will sweep through the
debris field trailing the comet 55/P Tempel-Tuttle, encountering a
cloud of comet dust that produces the Leonid meteor shower. Peak
visibility will be the night of Nov. 17 and early morning of Nov.
18, said astronomer John Wilson at Georgia State University, but
people in Asia are likely to have better viewing than those of us
on this side of the Pacific. ``But you never really know for
sure,'' he added. The number of meteors expected per hour also is
an unknown, he said, and could range from ``hardly any at all'' to
a few thousand.
</P>
<P>
   The Leonid meteors are small, compared to the killers of
Hollywood's ``Armageddon'' and ``Deep Impact,'' with most of the
particles in the dust cloud smaller than grains of beach sand.
While most of the incoming debris will burn up in the atmosphere,
scientists worry that hundreds of orbiting satellites high above
the atmosphere lie directly in harm's way. What will happen to
them, if anything, is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw that a stretch of the Chattahoochee River in Georgia
ranks among the nation's worst in total chlordane, making it
extremely hazardous to fish. I thought chlordane had been banned
for many years, so how could the toxic levels of the chemical still
be so high?
</P>
<P>
   A: Chlordane indeed has been banned, but that doesn't mean all
its troublesome effects are gone. Chlordane is a long-lasting
insecticide once pumped into the soil around homes to battle
termites. Before the 1980s, it also was used to control insects on
corn, grapes, strawberries and other crops. The chemical may be
leaching out of soil at construction sites and other places where
soil erosion is common. Old landfills, former wood-treating plants,
illegal dumping and contaminated storm runoff may be culprits for a
number of toxic chemicals affecting rivers. Other long-lasting
substances such as pentachlorophenol also are suspected of being
deposited in sediment years ago.

   FILM-HISTORYX _ ``American History X'' makes almost too good a
case for its white rage. Its litany of white woes _ the negative
effects of affirmative action, etc. _ is so articulately voiced,
and the film's ending is so shocking and unprovoked, that it could
even be viewed as a validation of skinheadism, a call to arms. Part

midst of an effort to produce airplanes quickly. Its slickest
product, the 777, takes 87 days to put together. Rich Hansen,
director of 777 operations and support services, says, ``Our goal
is to get it into the 40s.'' Last week I spent two days at

NEW BOOK ATTACKS GENERAL ELECTRIC AND ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JO-ANN JOHNSTON  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ A new book criticizes the General Electric Co.
and its chief executive, Jack Welch, charging that the company puts
profits ahead of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Any Cost: Jack Welch, General Electric and the Pursuit of
Profit'' ($29.95, Knopf) was written by Thomas O'Boyle, an editor
at the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. He said he took on the topic after
continually reading business magazine stories that painted Welch
and GE as heroes of the business world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was certainly not the company I have researched,'' said
O'Boyle, a former reporter at The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   GE was getting a ``mythology,'' he said, partly due to Welch's
skill at his style of capitalism, partly due to the chief
executive's charisma and partly to sophisticated public relations.
</P>
<P>
   Yet O'Boyle said he had covered a company that made huge job
cuts and caused widespread social problems.
</P>
<P>
   The far-flung, complex company managed to create a business
climate that allowed other morally questionable acts, such as
price-fixing, O'Boyle said.
</P>
<P>
   While newspapers across the country were telling the story of
workers who had lost their jobs during staff reductions, national
magazines tended to gloss over that picture and praise the company
for its financial results, O'Boyle said.
</P>
<P>
   So O'Boyle set out to do his own research. He spent 21 months
doing research for the book and interviewing more than 300 people,
he said. He started writing the book after he had resumed full-time
work at the Post-Gazette, which he joined as business editor.
</P>
<P>
   The result, according to a review this month in Publisher's
Weekly, is a ``scathing examination of Welch's tenure,'' and,
according to Kirkus Reviews, ``an impassioned indictment of a man,
a giant corporation, and a way of doing business at terrible
costs.''
</P>
<P>
   The book features lengthy descriptions of job cuts at GE's Power
Systems unit in Schenectady, N.Y.; pollution and other problems at
Knoll Atomic Power Laboratory in Niskayuna, N.Y., which GE formerly
operated; and PCB pollution in the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   GE used PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, for about three
decades as an insulator in electric capacitors. The company legally
discharged more than one million pounds of the chemicals into the
river before the chemicals were banned in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Welch did not agree to be interviewed for the book, and GE
sharply disagrees with the book's premise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company's successful track record over 17 years tells the
real story about the hunders of thousands of employees who have
made GE one of the most admired companies in the world,'' a
spokeswoman said.

   JOHN GLENN BEGINS SHUTTLE MISSION

<P>
   GLENN _ The main story. Glenn's launch goes off without a hitch,
and the nation swoons. We'll have everything in this one from
Glenn's first words in orbit to what the control tower finally has
decided to say in place of ``Godspeed John Glenn.'' President
Clinton led the cast of VIPs that included nearly his entire
cabinet, two dozen members of Congress and the Senate, and Gov.
George Voinovich. We get reaction from the biggies. Despite the
obvious appeal of relating his first flight to
</P>
<P>
   this one, little about today's flawless countdown, crystal clear
sky and righht-on-schedule liftoff was reminiscent of the 1962
flight. The media crowd thickened as launch closed in, and the
VIPs, who trolled through to do interviews during the mundane wait
of the countdown dissappeared late in the morning to be bussed out
to special viewing sites along the nearby Banana River. But the
drama of liftoff represents only a fraction of the crew's work for
the day. Eight minutes after launch, when orbit is achieved, the
workday really begins as the orbiter is reconfigured for use as a
laboratory. (Montgomery, Dayton Daily News) 50 inches. WITH PHOTOS

allowed contact with the crew, Miller and his wife were separated

   GA-CAMPAIGNADS _ATLANTA _ In campaign ads for lieutenant
governor, Mitch Skandalakis accuses his oppenent, Mark Taylor, of
being treated for drug treatment, which still plagues him. Taylor,
who has admitted using drugs in the early 1980s, sued for slander,
saying he's never been addicted and hasn't used drugs at all in
years. Is Skandalakis telling the truth, and does he have any
evidence to support the accusation? Does Taylor have any chance of
winning his lawsuit? How are the allegations and lawsuit playing
out in the race? First, Skandalakis _ who has a history of shooting
from the hip and getting sued for it _ won't tell us if he has
anything, but hasn't shown anything yet. Second, Taylor has no
chance of winning, since the courts protect speech in political
contests _ and it's unlikely he'll pursue it after the election.
Third, experts say it's only up to the voters to set limits on ugly
tactics and counter-spin. Mitch's campaign has been highly out of
line, some of them agree, but they've seen worse. Lawsuits such as
this are rare but not highly so; in fact, U.S. Rep. Richard
Gephardt was sued this week by his opponent in a similar case.

farmer Scott Brown telephoned Palm Beach County's environmental
resources office. This was no Yuletide courtesy call. ``I'm going
to start cutting the trees in an hour,'' Brown warned. He was
arrested, but acquitted. The judge ruled that Brown's tree-killing
wasn't criminal. In a memo released Wednesday, county officials
blame Raineri and Smith for failing to appear at the trial, the
State Attorney's Office for its handling of the case, and the judge
for refusing to allow evidence to be admitted at trial. ``It's a
travesty of justice,'' county Commission Chairman Burt Aaronson
said Wednesday. ``It gives people a license to do what they want
against code.'' Officials are waiting for Brown's next move. His
attorney, Mark Perry of Delray Beach, said Brown is contemplating
it. (Freeman, Palm Beach Post) MOVED

BRUTAL `AMERICAN HISTORY X' LACKS ANY MORAL LESSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard to feel too good about New Line Cinema's
skinhead-epic, ``American History X,'' given its harrowing
brutality, its numbing pessimism, its lack of a clear moral lesson,
and the efforts of its first-time director, Tony Kaye, to disown
it.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the 46-year-old British filmmaker (mainly of European
commercials) has not only tried to get his name taken off the
credits, he's actually taken out ads of denunciation in the trade
papers, and done everything else but throw rocks at the movie.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, New Line Cinema and star Edward Norton _ who
Kaye claims ended up editing much of the film _ profess to love
this chronicle of white rage in America, expect money reviews and
multi-Oscar nominations, and have painted Kaye as a prima donna, a
cry baby and a first-class weirdo.
</P>
<P>
   And though it's not exactly clear from the publicity what,
exactly, director and studio are fighting about (other than Kaye's
vague claims that the studio cut is not the film he set out to
make) my view of the movie tells me Kaye certainly has a reason to
be unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   As much as his movie wants to carry a powerful anti-hate
message, a transcendent vision simply doesn't come through. It
lacks the delicate balance and sure hand it needs to rise above its
violence. On this level, it badly misses its target.
</P>
<P>
   The storyline is about a working class family in Venice Beach,
Calif., which has gone to hell after its fireman father is killed
in a South Central riot and the local high school and middle-class
neighborhood has been overwhelmed by vicious black gangs.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest son, Derek (Norton), responds by putting pictures of
Hitler on his wall, tattooing a swastika on his chest and becoming
a rabid skinhead _ eventually going to prison after brutally
killing two blacks he catches in the act of breaking into his car
one night.
</P>
<P>
   Derek's story is told in black-and-white flashback through the
eyes of his 16-year-old brother, Danny (Edward Furlong), as he's
writing a paper on his family history for the black high school
principal (Avery Brooks) who wants to save him from the dead end of
skinheadism.
</P>
<P>
   When Derek is released from prison, he's a changed man, his
consciousness raised by a profound experience in stir. The rest of
the film chronicles the effect this defection has on Danny, their
brotherly relationship, their mother and sister, and the skinhead
population of Venice Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The film clearly wants to be a cautionary tale about the
negative impact of hate on one American family. There's a wonderful
moment, for instance, when Derek realizes that the worst thing
about his hate is that it's so ineffective _ it hasn't made his or
anyone else's life any better.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie is never really strong or clever enough to allow
this higher message to emerge _ with any real emotional impact at
least _ from the traumatic experience of viewing the succession of
beatings, torture, murders and wanton sprees of destruction. The
movie communicates apocalypse now, not hope.
</P>
<P>
   The main character's miraculous transformation is also not
handled well enough to grab our emotional or intellectual sympathy.
Norton may well be the best actor of the 20something generation and
a star-in-the-making, but he can't supply the beats that are
missing in the script. His character is not convincing.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, ``American History X'' makes almost too good a case
for its white rage. Its litany of white woes _ the negative effects
of affirmative action, etc. _ is so articulately voiced, and the
film's ending is so shocking and unprovoked, that it could even be
viewed as a validation of skinheadism, a call to arms. Part of the
problem, not the solution.
</P>
<P>
   American History X. Directed by Tony Kaye. Written by David
McKenna. Cast: Edward Norton, Edward Furlong, Stacey Keach, Elliot
Gould, Beverly D'Angelo. New Line Cinema. 118 minutes. Rated R for
violence.
</P>

BOEING IS FOCUSING ON SPEED _ BUT NOT THE MPH KIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Boeing Commercial Airplanes is in the midst of an
effort to produce airplanes quickly. Its slickest product, the 777,
takes 87 days to put together. Rich Hansen, director of 777
operations and support services, says, ``Our goal is to get it into
the 40s.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week I spent two days at ``Airplanes 101,'' a class the
Boeing division does for the press. The class is a mixture of
science, business and gee-whiz. Underneath was a repeated note of
urgency. This is a company that knows it will have to move much
faster.
</P>
<P>
   Its business already is global. Last week planes were being
readied for Britain, Saudi Arabia and Singapore, and being handed
off to a smiling delegation from China. But with the spread of
competitive fares, pressure rolls back through the airplane
manufacturer to cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   Assembling 4 million parts for an airplane has meant that
Boeing's parts inventory turns over only two times per year. That's
like rolling over a brontosaurus. On the 777, inventory turns are
at eight per year. Hansen says, ``We're working toward 12 next year
and 16 the year after.''
</P>
<P>
   The 777 team has quickened production by doing things
concurrently, rather than one after the other. On the 777, much was
done by designing it right the first time. On previous models,
one-quarter of the labor on the first 100 airplanes was rework _
doing things over. The 777 is designed to tighter tolerances, so
that the variation from nose to tail is ``less than the thickness
of a business card,'' Hansen says.
</P>
<P>
   A good design, says division president Alan Mulally, ``allows
real people to put together parts like Fisher-Price on Christmas
Eve.'' You can't put it together the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   Design itself will have to become radically faster. The 777 was
Boeing's first design to be simulated on computers rather than wood
and metal mock-ups. That saved labor, but not nearly enough time.
Design still took 54 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be able to get it down to 10,'' says Bob
Kelley-Wickemeyer, chief aeronautical engineer. Four and a half
years is too long in a fast-changing market.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley-Wickemeyer's team designs airplane wings. On the Boeing
767, they had to build 77 different wings for wind-tunnel tests. On
the 747-X, a double-decker 747 that was never built, he was able to
use computational fluid dynamics to reduce it to 10.
</P>
<P>
   Again, that saved money but not time. The focus is now time.
``Two years ago it took us 89 manufacturing days to build a
wind-tunnel wing,'' he says. ``We can routinely do it now in 14
days, and I know how to do it in six.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he has the wing, he has to calculate all the loads on it.
(Boeing wings are designed to withstand 3.75 times the force of
gravity.) The old way was to embed the wing with tiny hypodermic
needles, use a wind tunnel and physically measure the forces on
each needle. That took 20 months. So far, he has replaced the
needles with pressure-sensitive paint, and replaced much of the
wind-tunnel work with computers. He recently traveled to Russia to
talk to mathematicians about how to further replace physical tests
with computers. His goal is to reduce the 20 months to one.
</P>
<P>
   A shortening in time also simplifies the job. ``When it takes
you a long time to do things, other things change,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Another cause of delay is secrecy. Speaking at yesterday's
meeting of the Society of Information Management, Mulally noted
that the 777 includes major body sections from Japan and components
from many other countries. But that meant that nobody could keep
their knowledge secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``The toughest thing was to create a culture where everybody
would share their stuff,'' he said. ``You can't believe how
creative people are if they know what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulally didn't speak about the Sea Launch commercial rocket
project, which is in a different part of Boeing. But it recently
got in trouble for exactly such information sharing with its
partners from Norway, Ukraine and Russia. Boeing had not
compromised national security, the State Department said, but all
that sharing had broken the rules.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department delayed the project's first launch by two
months and required Boeing to pay for a computer system to allow
the government to snoop on engineers.
</P>
<P>
   The future Mulally described yesterday is the polar opposite of
this instinctive rule-following. In his vision, goods and ideas are
traded freely, business is global, airline tickets are cheap,
information is universal and ``we, the people of the world decide
what has value.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a world of immense opportunity. But Boeing _ and everyone
else _ will have to move quickly.

`DAVID &AMP; LISA' FALLS SHORT OF ORIGINAL MOVIE ABOUT MENTAL ILLNESS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ANN HODGES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oprah Winfrey takes us back to the '60s this weekend for a TV
movie remake of ``David &AMP; Lisa.''
</P>
<P>
   She should have left well enough alone. This ABC update (9 p.m.
EST Sunday) falls far short of the impact of 1962's classic
Oscar-nominee film from Frank and Eleanor Perry.
</P>
<P>
   In its day on the movie marquee, ``David &AMP; Lisa'' was a touching
new view of mental illness and emotionally disturbed teen-agers.
It's still touching, but it's hardly new. By now, there have been
enough TV movies of similar themes to stir quite another feeling _
of been there, seen that.
</P>
<P>
   The movie was black and white, and that in itself was
mood-setting, with Keir Dullea and Janet Margolin as the troubled
teens, and Howard DaSilva as the psychiatrist who helped them out
of their darkness.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the two principles are well-played: David by Lukas Haas
(of ``Mars Attacks!'' and the upcoming ``Breakfast of Champions'')
and Lisa by Brittany Murphy (of Broadway's ``A View from the
Bridge,'' the movie ``Clueless'' and the voice track of ``King of
the Hill'' _ she voices LuAnne and Joseph). Sidney Poitier plays
the doctor this time around. In this script, he seems little more
than gatekeeper, but he still manages to register commendable
compassion for his young patients.
</P>
<P>
   David can't bear having anyone touch him, he's obsessed with
time, and he dreams about ``clock executions.'' Lisa lives in her
own private world and speaks only in rhymes. Nobody's been able to
reach these two. But then they reach out to each other, and caring
for each other brings hope of healing.
</P>
<P>
   ``David &AMP; Lisa'' is the third TV offering from the ``Oprah
Winfrey Presents'' banner _ the others were ``Before Women Had
Wings'' and ``The Wedding.'' She's executive producer, along with
Kate Forte. Director Lloyd Kramer co-wrote the script with
psychiatrist-author Dr. Theodore Isaac Rubin, who wrote the book
upon which both movies are based.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't help, though, for Winfrey to sell her Oprah Presents
films like she sells books on her talk show. In an on-camera
introduction, Oprah top-bills the opening credits to instruct us on
what this TV movie means.
</P>
<P>
   `` `David &AMP; Lisa' is a timeless love story. Like David,
sometimes we can get consumed by fears and anxieties, so we play it
safe. But when you really love somebody, you can take that risk,
you're transformed,'' Oprah confides in her best guru mode. ``
`David &AMP; Lisa' shows us that love gives us the power to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Oprah's sticky introduction sets a scary precedent. What if all
TV movie producers demanded an on-camera pitch?
</P>
<P>
   But not even Oprah's overblown intro can make this ``David &AMP;
Lisa'' more than it is _ a little film about two sadly disturbed
teens.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Executive whirlpool &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's a cold, cruel bottom-line world in TV today, and
yesterday's heroes are the first to feel the chill. NBC's executive
turnover this week was the end of an era for the network and a sign
of changing times for all networks.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Littlefield has spent 20 of his 46 years at NBC, the last
nine of them as NBC Entertainment president. Now he and Don
Ohlmeyer, the white knight NBC brought in to add his considerable
muscle and know-how as NBC West Coast president in 1993, are headed
out. They once turned NBC's fortunes around and made fortunes for
the stockholders. They made NBC No. 1, with ``must-see'' TV hits
such as ``Seinfeld,'' ``Friends'' and ``ER.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Scott Sassa is in. He's a third-generation
Japanese-American who honed his skills at Ted Turner's cable
empire. He headed Turner Entertainment Group and Turner Pictures,
and helped launch TNT and Cartoon Network.
</P>
<P>
   At 39, he represents the new age, cable-wise, bright and expert
at making deals. As one Wall Street analyst said, ``He has a feel
for programming, and NBC feels it's time for change.''
</P>
<P>
   As Sassa said on CNBC this week, ``The big thing in this
business is (still) hit shows.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC's audience is down 11 percent this season. Profits are
expected to drop because ``Seinfeld'' is gone, and NBC is paying
$13 million per episode for ``ER.'' Littlefield and Ohlmeyer, once
on a roll, are not rolling out hits anymore. The hits they had are
getting old and tired.
</P>
<P>
   It's all been done in typical TV gentleman fashion _ for public
consumption, anyway. Littlefield announced that he'll produce shows
and has a production deal with NBC. Ohlmeyer's contract ends
January 2000, and he'll help Sassa get ready to take over his job
before he departs.
</P>
<P>
   Ohlmeyer and Littlefield leave with their heads high. Their
ability and unflagging enthusiasm for a game that by its nature is
no-win are a lesson for all those who would fill their king-size
shoes. &QL;

   James McBride's 78-year-old mother, Ruth McBride Jordan, can't
wait for her son's book to move off the national best-seller list.
</P>
<P>
   His book, ``The Color of Water'' (Riverhead Books, $12), has
been on the New York Times best-seller list for 87 weeks. It is a
poignant account of his mother's life. He recounts how Jordan, a
Jewish woman and a Polish immigrant, braved family and societal
scorn by marrying two African-American men and raising 12 children
in abject poverty.
</P>
<P>
   McBride bares his soul, describing what it was like to grow up
black with a secretive, tough-minded white mother. She survived the
death of two husbands to cajole, inspire and love her children
through colleges and professional schools. Her brood includes two
medical doctors, a psychologist, several educators and a computer
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   But Jordan, who now lives with a daughter in New Jersey, would
love to regain the jealously guarded privacy that shrouded her life
before McBride's book made her a national figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the book is sliding down the best-seller list _ it has gone
from 1 to 9 to 3 to 14 _ Mommy is going `Yeah!' '' said McBride, a
writer and musician.
</P>
<P>
   His mother gave only a few interviews when the book was released
in 1996. She has since refused all requests, including one last
month from the New York Times. She turned down an appearance on
``The Rosie O' Donnell Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was begging, `Mommy, please!' but she refused,'' said
McBride, who has an easygoing manner and a ready laugh. He was No.
8 in the family's pecking order.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes her happy that families with lots of kids are
inspired by the book,'' he said. ``But she doesn't know what the
fuss is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   The world would otherwise never have known Ruth McBride Jordan,
born Rachel Deborah Shilsky in 1921. Her life was unveiled because
of McBride's obsession in finding out who his mother was _ and in
the process finding out who he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I asked her where she was from, she would say, `God made
me,' and change the subject,'' he wrote in the book, describing his
childhood. ``When I asked her if she was white, she'd say, `No, I'm
light-skinned.' ''
</P>
<P>
   When he asked if God was black or white, she replied that God
had no color. ``God is the color of water. Water doesn't have a
color,'' his mother said.
</P>
<P>
   She deflected, sidestepped or evaded all questions about her
past, revealing only a few details. No one was to give out
information about the family, she ordered. Her brood followed that
directive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mommy never wanted to talk about it,'' McBride said.
</P>
<P>
   It was confusing for a young boy growing up in the projects of
New York to realize that the lone white face in the crowds of black
mothers leaving or picking up their children at school belonged to
his mother. It was not easy to determine if he belonged in a white
world or a black world.
</P>
<P>
   He admits there was an adolescent period when he was ashamed
that his mother was white, and he tried not to be seen with her.
But there was also a deep fear that one day his mother would be
beaten as she made her way home to the tough ghettoes where they
lived.
</P>
<P>
   McBride's father, Andrew D. McBride, died of cancer in 1957,
shortly before the younger McBride was born. His mother soon
remarried, this time to Hunter Jordan, a furnace fireman for the
New York City Housing Authority. Her second husband died in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   McBride was close to his black relatives, but he still wondered
about his mother's family.
</P>
<P>
   He became a journalist who worked for several newspapers
including the Washington Post and the Boston Globe. But he left
journalism to take up another lifelong passion: music. He loved
jazz and the saxophone. After selling a few songs to soul singer
Anita Baker, McBride decided he had enough money to devote time to
researching his mother's roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt a certain emptiness about myself, and I knew it had to
do with my personal identity,'' he said. ``I knew I had to, at some
point, figure out where I belonged in this world. And I realized I
couldn't do that until I figured out who Mommy was.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, he had been collecting information, scraps of data
that his mother would acknowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly but surely he began to piece together his mother's past.
Slowly but surely his mother began to cooperate. He traveled to
Suffolk, Va., where his mother grew up in the 1930s. By luck, he
found an elderly black man who knew his mother as a girl. That
discovery led to new information and new cooperation from his mom.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Deborah Shilsky grew up in an Orthodox Jewish home,
emigrating to the United States when she was 2. According to the
book, her father was a rabbi who could not keep a position with any
synagogue. He landed in Suffolk, where he opened a grocery store.
But he was also a racist who fleeced his black clientele
mercilessly. He worked his three children relentlessly and was
cruel to his wife. There was no love between father and family,
McBride said.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel, feeling the agony of anti-Semitism, preferred the name
Ruth. In 1939 at age 19, she ran away to New York, leaving behind
her mother, whom she loved, and a sister, Gladys. Her mother died
shortly afterward. She later learned that her brother Sam, who ran
away from home when he was 15, was killed in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Her family, including her sister and several aunts, considered
her dead after she married Andrew McBride, who was not only a
Gentile, but also a black man. McBride was a kind, deeply religious
man who inspired his wife to become a Christian. Together they
founded New Brown Memorial Baptist Church in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   But her family was alienated by her life choices, slamming the
door in her face when Ruth McBride sought financial help when her
first husband died.
</P>
<P>
   James McBride realized that his mother's story was a painful
collection of memories that she fled. And no memory was more
painful than his mother's admission that her father sexually abused
her.
</P>
<P>
   McBride had listened to her complain about her father one
afternoon while he preferred to think of his grandfather in rosier
terms. Finally, she wrote a word on a piece of paper and held it up
for him to read. It said MOLEST.
</P>
<P>
   ``It knocked me out,'' he said. ``I just sat there and the
journalist within me collapsed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see why she ran away from home,'' McBride said. ``She
didn't convert to Christianity because she hated Judaism. She
converted because she hated her father.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the difficulties of being a single mom, his mother
imbued her children with two values: a deep faith in God and a
desire to do well in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got ready Friday night for Sunday-morning church,'' McBride
said.
</P>
<P>
   His mother saw to it that they went to the best public schools,
even if it meant hours a day in subways and buses. She took
advantage of public-school transfers to send her children to
schools in suburbs, primarily white schools. Her faith in education
was not just talk. She returned to school and graduated with a
degree in social work administration in 1986 from Temple University
in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   She was tough on her children, not sparing the strap. ``Mommy
used to tear us up,'' recalled McBride, who can now recount
difficult incidents with humor.
</P>
<P>
   As in most families, there was happiness and sorrow. His mother
took her gang to every free concert, museum exhibit or neighborhood
event she could. But there were painful family problems. James
himself, after the death of his stepfather, became involved in
break-ins and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Mommy's'' values prevailed in the lives of her offspring.
McBride learned that race doesn't matter. His mother, his father
and his stepfather simply accepted all people regardless of color.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we allow people to educate themselves, then a lot of our
social problems will ultimately disappear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides making McBride a wealthy man and a sought-after speaker,
``The Color of Water'' has brought his mother and her surviving
sister, Gladys, still a practicing Jew, together. They met a year
ago. Her sister forgave Ruth's leaving the family, but could not
forgive her conversion to Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters have continued to correspond after Jordan survived
open-heart surgery last year.
</P>
<P>
   McBride said he is assisting musician Quincy Jones in writing
his autobiography. He is also working on a screenplay for ``The
Color of Water.'' He said he has been contacted by actress Sharon
Stone, who wants to direct the movie and he hopes it will be
produced next year.
</P>
<P>
   When that happens, Mommy will really lose her privacy. &QL;

HALLOWEEN PARTY DECORATIONS ARE A FUN FAMILY PROJECT

<P>
   No Halloween party is complete without a witch's cauldron. If
you don't happen to have the real thing, create your own. Fill a
cast-iron pot or kettle with chips (set atop a tray of dry ice for
spookier effect), or wrap a bucket, pot or punch bowl with black
crepe paper.
</P>
<P>
   Serve dips in plastic bowls set inside hollowed-out pumpkins.
Include a few extra pumpkins to hold candles.
</P>
<P>
   If you're serving punch, float a ``ghost's hand'' made with a
clean latex glove: fill with water, tie at the wrist with a
twist-tie, freeze.
</P>
<P>
   Yellow or red bell peppers are easily transformed into crazy
characters to place on the table for decoration or to hold dips.
Use radish slices, water chestnuts and whole cloves for eyes. Cut
the stem off and hollow out to form a mouth; with toothpicks,
secure a pimiento tongue or diced radishes for teeth. Create a
hairdo with grated carrots or cheese. Use your imagination; soon
you'll have an entire family of weird, wacky personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Cut out black cats and white ghosts from poster board and hang
from a chandelier, along with orange and black streamers. Cover the
table with black vinyl. Complete the look with a witch's hat
decorated with orange and black balloons for a centerpiece. Scatter
handfuls of plastic ants and spiders, and perhaps a few Gummi worms
around for an extra-creepy touch. Add black and orange paper plates
and napkins, and you're ready to party.
</P>
<P>
   If you prefer a more sophisticated look, try stacking pumpkins
for a centerpiece. Use the idea below, or borrow some tips from
``Simply Handmade'' (Meredith Books, $29.95): Drape a strand of
gold beads around the stack, or use gold spray paint to create an
elegant effect. Tie bows around the stems of mini pumpkins _ use
French-wired ribbons, raffia or traditional black and orange. Drag
out the holiday tinsel, experiment with stick-on gold stars or add
a touch of glitter for a glamorous Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   Light up the evening with lots of candles. Place in small,
hollowed-out pumpkins of various sizes. Nestle scented candles in
trays of popcorn kernels or tuck votives in among nuts or your
favorite snack mix.

   Three-Tier Pumpkin Centerpiece &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; From ``Halloween Treats'' by Donata Maggipinto (Chronicle
Books, $14.95)
</P>
<P>
   Materials:
</P>
<P>
   3 pumpkins in descending sizes
</P>
<P>
   Cake stand or platter
</P>
<P>
   Ivy, autumn leaves, acorns or dried berries on branches
</P>
<P>
   Arrange the pumpkins on the cake stand or platter with the
biggest one on the bottom and the smallest one (with stem intact)
on the top. Tuck leaves, ivy and other items around the base of the
pumpkin sculpture and around the pumpkins in the sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Create your own pumpkin patch. Fill your patio or back yard with
pumpkins. Add bales of hay, grapevine wreaths, fall leaves and a
few scarecrows to set the mood. Set out carving tools and
newspapers on picnic tables and invite guests to carve away.
They'll take their creations home, of course, but first have a
contest for the most intricate, scariest, weirdest, etc.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Offer your guests a ghoulish place to sit. Cover rounded card
table chairs with white sheets. On the fabric covering the chair
back, glue eyes and a nose cut from black poster board; add a
ghostly grin to the seat. Or, if you have time, cut black fabric
features and apply using transfer web, available at craft or fabric
stores. In a pinch, you can always draw the face with a black
permanent marker. Set the stage with lots of fake cobwebs, also
available at crafts stores, and place a human-size plastic skeleton
in one of the chairs for an fun effect.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hang edible ghosts from the ceiling to double as decorations and
party favors. Lay the center of a round lollipop in the center of a
white handkerchief, facial tissue or cloth square. Tie tightly just
below the ``head'' with a rubber band, twist-tie or string. Add two
black dots for eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Make larger ghosts from white sheets, using crushed newspaper
for heads. Tie with rope, ribbon or heavy string. Hang with fishing
line from the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   These ghosts are out of their gourds and easy to make: Paint
butternut squash white; when dry, add a ghoulish face on each with
black permanent marker.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Do the graveyard shift. Cut tombstones out of Styrofoam, poster
board or foam board and decorate with messages such as ``Boo,''
``RIP'' and ``Trick or Treat.'' Place inside or out; make miniature
versions for the serving table to carry out the theme. Have a dead
body or two lying around: place a rubber mask at one arm of your
sofa, make a body of pillows, cover with a white sheet, add a pair
of boots peeking out at the end. Play a tape of scary sounds for
background music and use a black light for ultimate effect. Rent a
horror movie to watch as a group. &QL;

DANA BUCHMAN, A `GET REAL' DESIGNER FOR REAL WOMEN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LINDA GILLAN GRIFFIN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Dana Buchman's fashions are as friendly and
straightforward as she is. No pretense. No delusions of grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   The grandeur in Buchman's collections is real, put there on
purpose by a woman who knows how other women want to dress.
</P>
<P>
   A rich, red chenille sweater set burns as brightly as flame, yet
is cool to the touch. The white taffeta, tea-length ball skirt with
a black sweater top combines innocence and worldliness. The gray
suit, in a fabric with a slight sheen, a svelte longer jacket and
crisp pants with stovepipe legs, is dressy enough for a luncheon
but still suitable for work.
</P>
<P>
   The pantsuit, in fact, is one of Buchman's favorites. She wore
it during a recent visit to Houston, where engagements included a
panel discussion and fashion show benefiting the Fashion Group
International Inc., a dinner and an early breakfast, and a fashion
show at Dillard's.
</P>
<P>
   Women flock to talk to Buchman. They tell her how they collect
her clothes and are comfortable enough to suggest items they'd like
to see in her lines _ and asking why her skirts seem to fit tighter
these days. Buchman takes it all in stride.
</P>
<P>
   There are three lines _ Dana Buchman, Dana B &AMP; Karen (with
partner Karen Berman) and Dana Buchman Luxe. Each requires new
shipments every month, making essentially 36 mini-collections every
year. Buchman also includes petites and plus sizes.
</P>
<P>
   The company is part of Liz Claiborne, one of the most prolific
designers in the fashion business. Claiborne was Buchman's mentor.
After seven years she asked Buchman if she would be interested in
designing a more upscale clothing line.
</P>
<P>
   Would she? That was in 1987. Buchman's designs were a hit from
the beginning, even with price tags that often shock the
traditional Claiborne customer. That flame-red, chenille sweater
set sells for just under $600, and it's not unusual for jackets to
cost $500-$600. A Buchman silk blouse can set a woman back $200 or
more.
</P>
<P>
   These are not clothes women buy for weekends, as they might some
Liz Claiborne pieces. For most of her clients, Buchman's pieces are
investments, among the most expensive and most treasured fashions
in her closet.
</P>
<P>
   Buchman herself is unassuming, outwardly changing very little
since the '80s. She's tall, slim, with gold wire-rimmed glasses,
her hair in a blondish bob.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Tom Farber, is a criminal court judge, and she
alternates taking her two daughters, 10-year-old Annie Rose and
12-year-old Charlotte, to their respective schools via New York's
subways. She has a passion for cooking. Her favorite at-home
outfits are animal print pull-on pants with elastic waists.
</P>
<P>
   It surprises her clients, she said, that she has a real life, a
``normal life.'' But then the quieter approach to fashion in the
Liz Claiborne companies makes having a life possible. There are no
big runway shows during press week, no supermodels and no groupies
or hangers-on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really do make clothes for us,'' she tells one of the large
Houston gatherings, ``for women who walk down the street.''
Admittedly, though, hardly any women in Houston actually walk down
the street. It's always too hot, too cold, too wet or too far.
</P>
<P>
   The good news, however, is that should a woman choose to walk
down the street, Buchman's silks will withstand the humidity _ and
they're heavy enough to wear year-round.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to describe herself, Buchman is hard pressed to come
up with an answer, although she readily admits having a practical
side. While she loves the creative process of fashion design, she
rarely talks about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I should,'' she said. ``Maybe I should share that part
of my life more when I go out to talk in the community.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a side that includes, she said, ``Colors, dreams, sex and
sensuality'' _ all the sides of today's women.
</P>
<P>
   Buchman's clothes are not cutting-edge fashion, but they are
fashionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The women I dress don't want to be on the cutting edge of
fashion, but they are chic, sophisticated and love fashion. They're
funny, witty and intelligent.''
</P>
<P>
   She designs in colors women have already seen from more
fashion-forward designers. She is right on the money for fall and
winter with gray, red, gold and purple. There is even a dragonfly
motif on a layered organza tunic.
</P>
<P>
   The higher price tags on her merchandise, when compared to Liz
Claiborne products, stem from their luxury fabrics. Buchman likes
the fact women feel special buying her clothes, such as the
all-over floral embroidered, midnight-blue velvet jacket.
</P>
<P>
   Expensive at $448? Perhaps, but certainly not by the yardstick
of designers such as Donna Karan or Calvin Klein.
</P>
<P>
   Buchman believes women should buy fewer and better clothes. She
urges women to pare down their wardrobes, to buy only what they
love. Then it will be easier to get dressed.
</P>
<P>
   Buchman does have her eye on the future. Already there are
licensees for handbag and eyewear lines, and yes, she hopes to go
all the way with shoes and linens for the home.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things that draws Houston women to Buchman's fashions
is that she consistently includes color in her collections.
</P>
<P>
   ``American women have a very level-headed approach to fashion
that begins with equality. And I think it comes out in their
dressing.''

`GONE WITH THE WIND' VIDEO ARRIVES AT BARGAIN BASEMENT PRICE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Millions of viewers have cherished ``Gone With the Wind'' for
decades _ decades of frustration.
</P>
<P>
   We've often sat through what seemed like 396 commercials to see
the four-hour Civil War classic on cable _ perhaps even split into
two nights.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps we winced while watching the botched reissue in
theaters recently, where the ``restored'' cut looked like it was
made in the 1860s.
</P>
<P>
   As for video, ``Gone With the Wind'' has been geared solely to
the rental market since the two-tape movie first reached tape in
1985.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, you could buy it _ for an effective retail price of $90.
The film never has hit the low-priced sales market at a reasonable
cost.
</P>
<P>
   Until now. This week, ``Gone With the Wind'' is breezing into
stores at its lowest price. Many stores are selling it for as low
as $19.95, and it's unlikely others will charge more than $30.
</P>
<P>
   For its first sell-through campaign, the film has been digitally
remastered, including 13 minutes that were believed to have been
irreparably damaged. Focus, resolution, color and sound quality are
sharper than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The film also is available on DVD at a price of as low as
$19.95. DVD editions include the original theatrical trailer, and
you can choose between the soundtrack in its original form or in
newly created digital surround sound. DVD releases also come with
an eight-page booklet on the making of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   On tape or on disk, ``Gone With the Wind'' is one film worth
owning. After 13 years of waiting for such a sales campaign,
frankly, you should give a damn.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More vintage fare &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other vintage films getting a new video push include 20 top
Paramount flicks chosen by 30,000 people in magazine and website
surveys.
</P>
<P>
   Due this week, the movies of Paramount's ``Millennium
Collection'' cost $14.95 or $24.95, with longer ones going for the
higher price. (The exception is ``True Grit,'' which is $9.95.)
Twelve films also have a wide-screen option.
</P>
<P>
   The other films are ``Airplane!,'' ``Apocalypse Now,''
``Braveheart,'' ``Breakfast at Tiffany's,'' ``Chinatown,'' ``Fatal
Attraction,'' ``Flashdance,'' ``Forrest Gump,'' ``Ghost,'' ``The
Godfather,'' ``The Godfather Part II,'' ``Grease,'' ``The Hunt for
Red October,'' ``Saturday Night Fever,'' ``Star Trek IV: The Voyage
Home,'' ``The Ten Commandments,'' ``Terms of Endearment,'' ``Top
Gun'' and ``White Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Elvis by phone &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the new ``First-Ever Elvis'' video isn't widely
available in stores. Many readers have called to ask where it can
be found.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is to buy by phone. Try calling 800-367-8437. Cost is
$19.95, plus $5 for shipping and handling.
</P>
<P>
   ``First-Ever Elvis'' has what's believed to be the first film of
Elvis Presley performing. The color home movies _ which have no
sound _ were taken by Jim and Lois Robertson of Houston at a
recreational area known as Magnolia Gardens on Aug. 7, 1955.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Paramount has just reissued six Presley films _ digitally
remastered and with new packaging _ for $14.95.
</P>
<P>
   They are ``Roustabout,'' ``Fun in Acapulco,'' ``G.I. Blues,''
``Blue Hawaii,'' ``King Creole'' and ``Paradise, Hawaiian Style.''
</P>
<P>
   All but ``Roustabout'' also are sold in a five-tape gift pack
for $59.80. ``Easy Come, Easy Go'' also is available in new
packaging for $14.95.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Cats'' on tape &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Cats'' seems to be everywhere these days _ and that includes
video.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Broadway's longest-running musical is returning to
Houston for another engagement at Jones Hall, a new film of the
kitty-loving stage show is on video starting this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cats'' (PolyGram, two hours, $24.95) was filmed over 16 days
on a specially designed set at a London theater.
</P>
<P>
   No audience was present, and the 16 camera positions involved
new lighting and other tweaking. But this is basically the same
show as seen on stage.
</P>
<P>
   The cast includes Elaine Paige as Grizabella, who sings the
show-stopping ``Memory.'' Directing was David Mallet, who also
helmed ``Lord of the Dance'' and U2's ``Zoo TV Live from Sidney.''
</P>
<P>
   It's extremely unusual for a Broadway show to be filmed as it
was originally presented. When adapted as movies, musicals take on
entirely new dimensions and aren't confined to the stage.

<P>
   ``Mulan'' in February &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Disney has set Feb. 2 as release date for its animated
``Mulan,'' with a suggested price of $26.99.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps more exciting for Disney fans is news that another
animated classic is returning to video. It's 1961's ``101
Dalmatians,'' a film so popular that it sparked a hit live-action
remake in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Lady and the Tramp,'' which just began its second video
run, ``Dalmatians'' was first sent to video in the 1980s, when the
market was much smaller and relatively few copies were sold. The
animated film about spotted pups and English dognappers is set to
return March 9, with a suggested price of $26.99.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scare fare &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As Halloween approaches, scary movies are slithering onto video
shelves, including new editions of four George Romero flicks.
</P>
<P>
   They're ``Night of the Living Dead'' and ``Day of the Dead,''
both $9.99, and ``The Crazies'' and ``Season of the Witch,'' both
$14.98.
</P>
<P>
   All are from Anchor Bay, which also has reissued Sam Raimi's
original ``The Evil Dead,'' digitally remastered, for $9.99.
There's also a collector's edition of it for $14.98, including the
original trailer and liner notes from star Bruce Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   If that's not enough, try the ``limited edition'' for $19.98,
which includes a 32-page booklet with previously unseen photos
among other features.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evil Dead 2'' _ virtually a remake, but far superior _ also is
available for $9.99.
</P>
<P>
   As for John Carpenter's ``Halloween,'' it's in a new wide-screen
edition _ with the original trailer _ for $14.98 or in pan-and-scan
for $9.99. The latter version also comes packaged with a
20th-anniversary T-shirt for $24.99.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Also due this week:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lion King II: Simba's Pride,'' ``Deep Impact,'' ``The
Butcher Boy,'' ``Clockwatchers'' and ``Hey Mr. Producer!''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Due next week:
</P>
<P>
   ``Godzilla,'' ``Wild Man Blues,'' ``Nevada'' and ``Les
Miserables.'' &QL;

A CHILD'S FASCINATION WITH VAMPIRES LEADS TO A LIFETIME OF WRITING
ABOUT THEM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PAMELA MITCHELL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a child, Katherine Ramsland made one wish before falling
asleep each night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wished I would wake up and be a vampire,'' she admitted. ``I
read `Dracula' when I was 8 or 9. He had it all. He was alluring,
sophisticated, a figure of power. I wanted to be in his coffin.''
</P>
<P>
   After years of waking up disappointed, Ramsland decided to turn
her fascination into a writing career. The New Jersey author's
works include ``Prism of the Night: A Biography of Anne Rice,''
``The Vampire Companion: The Official Guide to Anne Rice's `The
Vampire Chronicles' '' and ``Piercing the Darkness: Undercover with
Vampires in America Today,'' published this month.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsland decided to write ``Piercing the Darkness'' after a
novice reporter disappeared in 1996 while investigating Manhattan's
vampires.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsland picked up where the reporter left off, later moving on
to vampire scenes in other U.S. and European cities. She
interviewed everyone from club kids to fang-makers, then went
online to track down those who drink blood (from willing and
unwilling victims) and believe they are the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   The result: an exhaustive look at the vampire subculture, a
growing group of enthusiasts who believe in and emulate vampires.
Rice's novels and the live-action, role-playing game ``Vampire: The
Masquerade'' have been this group's biggest influences so far.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsland visited Houston last week for a book-signing and a
night out with local vampires at Spy, a Houston nightclub. While
vampires in New York and Los Angeles tend to model themselves after
Rice's characters, ``Houston's vampires are much campier,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hinton, a Houston fang-maker, agrees. He showed up at last
week's book-signing dressed more like the Count from ``Sesame
Street'' than Lestat. Hinton says Houston's vampires are also
lower-key than those in other large cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Houstonians, we're the most evolved vampire. We walk around
during the day. We don't believe in blood-drinking,'' Hinton said.
</P>
<P>
   This city-by-city interpretation of the vampires doesn't thrill
Ramsland.
</P>
<P>
   ``In researching this book, I found out that the modern vampire
culture isn't as attractive to me as the vampire legend itself. The
definition of what a vampire is has changed so much. Today's
vampires come in all kinds. Some are predatory. Some are nurturing
and family-oriented,'' she said, adding with disbelief: ``What is
that? A nurturing vampire?''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what attracts mere mortals to the vampire scene, she said:
``It's very cool to be a vampire. It's this larger-than-life figure
that achieves the ultimate satisfaction, nightly. It's a way to go
above the mundane.''
</P>
<P>
   Hinton offered a simpler explanation: ``I think it's just
because the fangs feel so good.''

HALLOWEEN IS THE TIME TO REVIEW THOSE WONDERFUL VAMPIRES AND THEIR
MOVIES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PAMELA MITCHELL

<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe it's the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Those full, inviting lips held apart by just the hint of fangs.
</P>
<P>
   Or the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Piercing and hypnotic.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's the wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   These creatures do dress to kill, draping their undead bodies in
dark velvets, satin and leather.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, we mere mortals are fascinated by vampires.
For centuries, we've explored the vampire legend _ first in books,
then in countless movies and TV shows. With yet another vampire
flick, ``John Carpenter's Vampires,'' hitting theaters Friday, we
thought it was time to offer the following list of our favorite
vampires. We stuck to big-and small-screen bloodsuckers, leaving
behind those who inhabit the literary and comic book realm:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bela Lugosi's Count Dracula _ On any given day, your
neighborhood video store will be out of the few copies it stocks of
the 1931 black-and-white ``Dracula.'' Lugosi was the first to
interpret Bram Stoker's vampire count for the big screen. Although
the performance is stagey _ he'd previously played the role in the
theater _ Lugosi manages more with an icy stare than any movie
Dracula since. Hungarian-born, he is also the most ethnically
authentic Dracula. &UR;  &LR; This early talkie may seem slow at times but
keep watching, if only for Lugosi. He is one slick vampire _ cape
and all.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tom Cruise's Lestat _ There are two camps when it comes to the
vampires in 1994's adaptation of Anne Rice's ``Interview With the
Vampire:'' Lestat fans and Louis (Brad Pitt) fans. We are decidedly
Lestat lovers. From his casual instructions to the freshly bitten
Louis (``Your body is dying. Pay no attention.'') to his response
when asked why he tortures his victims (``I like to do it! I enjoy
it!''), Lestat does not apologize for being a vampire. He never
hesitates when doing what is in his nature and has no regrets,
unlike the whiny Louis. Lestat also scores points for his sense of
humor, which is often sick but always clever.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Lee's Count Dracula _ When it comes to stopping a
screaming victim with a look, Lee is second only to Lugosi. In
1958's ``Horror of Dracula,'' Lee's count is one of few words. He
simply glides into a scene, giving young maidens his ``I'm going to
suck you dry'' stare. They line up, necks bared. This English
offering launched Hammer Films' successful Dracula series.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Frid's Barnabus Collins _ From 1967 to 1971, Frid
played a 200-year-old vampire in the Gothic TV soap opera ``Dark
Shadows.'' Collins wants to be cured. We mention him mainly because
he was one of the first reluctant vampires. His story carved the
way for the likes of Detective Nick Knight in ``Forever Knight''
and Angel in ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   James Marsters' Spike and Juliet Landau's Drusilla _ Vampires
come and go on the WB's ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' but none
grabbed our attention like this happy couple. Spike is a nasty
modern-day vampire bent on killing the slayer and importing as many
demons as he can to Sunnydale. His only other passion (and his
grandest) is the psychic yet mad Drusilla. Landau (daughter of
Martin) portrays her insanity perfectly. While the love between
these two at times threatens to soften their blow as bloodsuckers,
it never actually happens. Here's hoping show creator Joss Whedon
brings back Spike and Drusilla.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The following vamps also deserve honorable mentions:
</P>
<P>
   Max Schreck's Count Orlok _ From the 1922 German film
``Nosferatu.'' Possibly the first and ugliest vamp on film.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   George Hamilton's Count Dracula _ So, how exactly does a vampire
get such a tan? We like the 1979 ``Love at First Bite'' about as
much as 1995's ``Dracula: Dead and Loving It.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   David Boreanaz's Angel _ The hunkiest of all vampires keeps the
slayer sidetracked on ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer.'' He gets his own
show next fall.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Frank Langella's Count Dracula _ Frangella re-creates his
Broadway performance in the 1979 ``Dracula.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gary Oldman's Count Dracula _ Oldman plays a romantic vampire in
the 1992's ``Bram Stoker's Dracula.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Paul Reubens' Amilyn _ Reubens, aka Pee Wee Herman, is perhaps
one of the best reasons to rent the 1992 movie ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer.'' After getting his arm cut off, this vamp shouts ``You
ruined my jacket! Kill him, a lot!''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Count _ For many of us, this ``Sesame Street'' character was
our first introduction to vampires.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Rutherford's Caitlin _ This modern vampire in the 1992 TV
show ``Kindred: The Embraced'' was a savvy businesswoman. She owned
a nightclub, what else?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   William Marshall's Blacula _ Before Wesley Snipes' recent
half-vampire/half-human in ``Blade,'' Marshall's creature in the
``Blacula'' movies was the only African-American vampire.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kirsten Dunst's Claudia _ This child vamp in ``Interview With
the Vampire'' announces after her first slurp of blood, ``I want
more!'' &QL;

COLOMBIAN BAND `BLOQUE' HAS NAME WITH MULTIPLE MEANINGS, MUSIC WITH
MULTIPLE RHYTHMS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICK MITCHELL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Colombian band Bloque is named for after the government
posse assembled to hunt down cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar. The
band's full name in Spanish is ``Bloque de Busqueda,'' which
translates as ``Search Party.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as lead singer Ivan Benavides points out, the word
``bloque'' has multiple meanings in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a word for party, but it's also a word for `unity,' ''
Benavides said from Eugene, Ore., where the band stopped last week
on its first U.S. tour. ``We took the name as an ironic comment on
the reality of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Bloque's self-titled debut album, available in the United States
on David Byrne's Luaka Bop label, not only expands the range of
rock en espanol; it is also one of the year's best rock albums,
period. The band's performances have been drawing rave reviews
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 5, Bloque makes its Houston debut at Fitzgerald's.
Locally based 6-West kicks off the party at about 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Benavides, who writes most of Bloque's material with lead
guitarist Ernesto ``Teto'' Ocampo, describes the ensemble's music
as ``psychotropical funk. It's more than rock en espanol. We have
many influences besides rock _ funk, jazz, salsa, reggae, rap,
traditional music. We put it in a shaker, and this is the result.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many rock en espanol bands, which too often sound just
like North American punk-rock or heavy metal bands singing in
Spanish, Bloque maintains a distinctly tropical sense of rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cumbia is our main rhythm. It's like the blues for us, our
root,'' Benavides said of the music of Colombia. ``Much of our
music is cumbia, put in a modern way.''
</P>
<P>
   What distinguishes Bloque from more traditional salsa and cumbia
bands _ besides the electric guitars, funky bass lines and
occasional rap interludes _ is the biting social commentary in the
lyrics. Benavides cites Ruben Blades, who brought a fresh and
intelligent lyrical perspective to salsa music in the 1980s, among
his musical heroes.
</P>
<P>
   The last song on Bloque's album is called ``Descarga.'' The
lyrics go, ``We're partying, and the world is crumbling ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Another song, ``El Hedor'' (``The Stench''), compares social
conventions to a woman who wears too much makeup and perfume to
cover ugly reality. ``Lo que Sucede'' (``What's Happening?'')
decries the widespread apathy that allows injustice to continue.
</P>
<P>
   But Benavides says his songs aim more for irony than ideological
correctness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be the preacher, the owner of a big message.
In this way, we can dance our sadness, and we can dance our rage.''
</P>
<P>
   In Colombia, Bloque is breaking down the barriers between
traditional folk music, salsa and rock. In the song ``Nena,''
Ocampo toys with Jimmy Page's acoustic guitar intro from Led
Zeppelin's ``Babe, I'm Gonna Leave You.'' The rest of the band
eventually opens up into a Cuban ``guajira'' rhythm, but Benavides'
vocal echoes Zep's Robert Plant throughout the song.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rock and salsa are expressions of different cultures, but
they're both big-city music,'' Benavides said. ``We love these rock
songs we hear on the radio. But it's like, `How can we say it in a
Latin way?' ''
</P>
<P>
   One subject not mentioned in any of the group's songs is drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is our personal choice, not to celebrate drugs in our
songs,'' Benavides said.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of Bloque tour with Latin pop star Carlos Vives,
a stadium headliner in the Spanish-speaking world. Benavides, who
also played Colombian Latin jazz singer Lucia, co-wrote several of
the songs of Vives' hit album ``Tierra del Olvido.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he says the band is enjoying its first U.S. club tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love to play for mixed audiences, like we've had in some
cities. The Chicano audience is a great audience for our music. But
it's also great to see whites and blacks and Latinos interacting.
When they are hearing us, there are no mental ghettoes. They're
part of the unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's not because we are promoting unity. Maybe it's
because music just joins different people together.''

COMIC FINDS ALL `LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
EDITORS NOTE: Benigni speaks incorrect English By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Many viewers find his movie beguiling and
heartbreakingly life-affirming. Others find it a misguided concept.
Some _ especially those who have not seen it _ consider the whole
thing a ghastly idea.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Life Is Beautiful,'' Roberto Benigni, an Italian comic
hugely popular in Europe, attempts something that is either in
wretched taste or heroically brave. Or both. It is a comedy set in
the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   It is, to be sure, a World War II comedy with a great deal to
say about courage and humanity _ one intended to bring tears as
much as laughter. The movie won the Grand Jury Prize at Cannes and
was also nominated for the Golden Palm. It won the People's Choice
Award at the Toronto Festival. It was being mentioned as a possible
Oscar nominee for best picture (not best foreign-language film)
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The story: Guido (Benigni) and his son are taken to a
concentration camp. Wanting to protect the boy from fear, Guido
deceives him about the nature of the camp, insisting it is all an
elaborate game.
</P>
<P>
   Understand that this film owes far more to the traditions of
Charlie Chaplin than to, say, ``Hogan's Heroes.'' A key to
appreciating the movie is to understand, before going in, that it
is intended as a fable, not realism.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fable invented from the truth,'' Benigni says.
</P>
<P>
   Some Americans will find Benigni's eccentric physical and verbal
comic assault uncomfortably remindful of Jerry Lewis at his worst.
</P>
<P>
   There's no denying he is a force of nature. When he enters the
room for this interview, happily shouting greetings, it's like some
cartoon dynamo has whirled in. Sitting still, he burns energy with
constant, flamboyant hand gestures.
</P>
<P>
   Benigni relishes performing and can command a room. In fact, he
is just as successful as a stage comic as he is in movies. But he
admits that he had his doubts while he was writing ``Life Is
Beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I always when I am writing I have doubts,'' said Benigni in
heavily accented and frequently convoluted English. ``Luckily, I
don't like very sure people. Ha, ha, ha, ha ... I like to be not
sure. This is very human. I think tigers, too, they are not sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case even more, because of the subject. But I must say
that something was pushing me so hard-ly to make this movie. I like
the story so much. First of all, it's a love story. What's more
simple than a father protecting his son, the purity, the innocence?
It's something very simple and strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``And yet, some doubts, because extermination camp is an extreme
situation. I think, I hope, I'm sure that I know what pain is and
respect the memory of Holocaust. This is my contribution to the
Holocaust as a comedian. I couldn't do a true story like a
`Schindler's List'.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt the necessity to talk about this, because I think after
we read about Holocaust I don't think we are the same. We change
something inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he made the movie, Benigni sent his script to ``the Milan
Jewish community'' to seek feedback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was afraid I could hurt or offend someone, because I am a
comedian. In Italy I am so well-known as a very popular comedian. I
am like Donald Duck. So Donald Duck making a movie about Holocaust
could, I understand, (be a problem).''
</P>
<P>
   Benigni said his Jewish readers pointed out technical
inaccuracies in the script. (The movie's camp is stylized and
stagey, like a 1940s Hollywood set, not attempting reality.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I am an artist, so I needed to take some license;
I must be free. But are you offended by the script? They told me it
was wonderful, and they helped me a lot. Survivors, during the
shooting they came a lot to visit the set. They told me a lot of
things really very touching.''
</P>
<P>
   Holocaust survivors attending the first screening in Milan
provided an unusual experience for Benigni at the movie's end. As a
comedian, he says, he is used to seeing people laughing when the
lights go up.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. In this movie everybody was crying,'' he said, explaining
that this ``contradiction'' had a strong impact on him.
</P>
<P>
   When Guido and his son go to the camp in the movie, Guido's
wife, who is not Jewish, insists on being sent to the camp, too.
Dora, the wife, is played by Benigni's real-life wife and frequent
co-star, Nicoletta Braschi.
</P>
<P>
   Benigni, who turned 46 on Tuesday, lives in Rome. His father, a
farmer, was in the Italian army in World War II and was put in a
Nazi work camp for the last two years of the war. He came home both
emaciated and still frightened.
</P>
<P>
   Benigni said his father would have horrible nightmares, and for
many years whenever he talked about the camp, his stories were
about the misery there. Eventually, his wife told him that the
stories frightened the children, including Roberto, so he began
telling the stories with a humorous approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and my sister started to smile,'' Benigni said. ``He
started to laugh, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after that, the nightmares went away.
</P>
<P>
   Benigni hopes in some small way, his movie can have the same
effect.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Where credit is due &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Pleasantville'' marks the movie-directing debut of
screenwriter Gary Ross (``Big'' and ``Dave'') He was, as director,
entitled to the credit, ``A film by Gary Ross,'' but he did not
want it because he believes a movie should be seen as a
collaboration among many people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `film by' credit is just an abomination to me,'' Ross said
vehemently. ``Look, I wrote, directed and produced `Pleasantville'
and did (some of) the special effects in my office, and I wouldn't
take a `film by' credit. What would that say about (for example)
Joan Allen? What does that say about my director of photography, my
editor, about Randy Newman (who did the music)?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a film by me.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whatever works &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``What Dreams May Come'' has some dazzling, cutting-edge special
effects, many of which were developed specifically for the film.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the most eye-catching, the scene in which Robin
Williams runs across a field of upturned faces in hell, was not so
cutting-edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was so low-tech,'' said producer Barnet Bain. ``Amazing,
isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   ``We built a false floor and cut out a bunch of holes. We made
about a thousand latex and plaster masks and laid them across this
floor. And we cut out holes about every fourth or fifth face, and
we had some people sitting on chairs (under the floor) with their
faces poked through.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the real faces were carefully placed so as to give
Williams a path of latex faces to run across.

INVENTORS' PERSONALITIES ARE LINKED TO THEIR INVENTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA McUSIC 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The average junior high school math class with 20 used personal
computers has more computing power than the Pentagon did after the
launch of Sputnik in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as the early 1980s, the electric typewriter was
still the preferred U.S. business machine.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, information transfers have taken over voice
communications as the most important telecommunications traffic.
</P>
<P>
   How far we've come. Those are just a few examples illustrating
the technological advances in the second half of this century.
Today, we take for granted our cell phones, ATM cards, laptop
computers and Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it wasn't too long ago that none of them existed.
</P>
<P>
   For an interesting chronology of how the computer and its
ancillaries developed over the past 60 years, read ``Forbes
Greatest Technology Stories: Inspiring Tales of the Entrepreneurs
and Inventors Who Revolutionized Modern Business'' (John Wiley &AMP;
Sons, 368 pages, $24.95).
</P>
<P>
   The book was written by ``Forbes'' contributing editor and
business technology reporter Jeffrey Young, who does an adequate
job of linking the personalities of the inventors with the wires,
chips, disk drives and screens of their creations.
</P>
<P>
   He also analyzes the significance of these major technological
inventions.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this passage on the first semiconductor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took alchemy, pure alchemy, to create the magical compound
of the second half of the twentieth century: the semiconductor,''
he writes. ``As the 1950s began, a handful of men transmuted a few
of the most common chemicals on earth into space-age substances
that defied the laws of Newtonian physics, took their early masters
into a new realm of quantum mechanics, and made possible previously
unimaginable products. ... Its discovery proved to be the dawn of a
new age.''
</P>
<P>
   Young takes readers through the development of the first
semiconductor by a number of scientists, leading to the involvement
of a small company in Dallas called Texas Instruments, which
gambled everything to be in the emerging market that it ultimately
dominated.
</P>
<P>
   Young also describes calculators, the mainframe computer, the
minicomputer, integrated circuits, microprocessors, personal
computers, Windows software, cell phones and Internet networking.
</P>
<P>
   Of the latter, Young relates that networking had a very
practical beginning: a romance.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Lerner and Leonard Bosack, graduate computer science
students at Stanford University who were also married, worked long
hours in separate buildings managing the university's computer
labs.
</P>
<P>
   They wanted to communicate via computer but were both on small
systems that weren't linked, unless they sent their messages
through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pair of computer graduate students thought this was crazy,
and they set about creating a way for local data traffic to be
passed around on campus, before it was sent out to the Internet,''
Young writes. ``... Why not design a small local router, whose job
was to manage data traffic among various small local networks?''
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems, which now supplies more than 80 percent of the
equipment that powers the Internet, was born thus. The company,
started in 1984, has grown from $60 million to $8 billion with its
data router.
</P>
<P>
   While marveling at the technological wonders that he describes,
Young contends that the best is yet to come, largely because of the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only limits to the Internet are those of the human
imagination, and the personal will of new entrepreneurs to create
business successes,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the experience of the past 10 years _ or even the 50 years
of the digital age _ is anything to go by, there's no shortage of
either of those things in this world. If anything, the supply of
both is increasing.''

   Why be a boring accountant when you could be an investigative
accountant, searching out fraud and sniffing out indiscretions? Or
how about being a family historian, capturing a family's life in
words? Or a space lawyer, digital journalist or home schooling
consultant? This book, part of an extensive series, ``... For

   John Wiley &AMP; Sons, $14.95
</P>
<P>
   As the title suggests, this book focuses on teaching personal
finance skills to people after they've retired, a break from the
norm. Father-and-son attorneys Ron and Murray Yolles discuss the
retirement period that could be 20, 30 or even 40 years, focusing
on ``how to achieve a growing and sustainable source of cash
flow.'' Investments, insurance, estate planning and other topics
are discussed with a minimum of lawyerese.

LIFE IS, MAYBE, TOO BEAUTIFUL IN HOLOCAUST COMEDY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You'll probably hear a lot about ``Life Is Beautiful,'' a period
comedy starring, co-written and directed by Roberto Benigni that
dares to take on the Holocaust. But one of its best scenes doesn't
deal specifically with the movie's subject, but with ``Life's''
theme: love.
</P>
<P>
   A rapt Guido Benigni gazes at the woman he has come to love,
Dora (Nicoletta Braschi). That may not sound like much, but Benigni
stages it in a crowded opera house. Every head in the theater is
turned toward the stage except his. He's staring up at Dora, and it
may be one of the most wondrous and foolishly romantic scenes ever
filmed. This scene has antecedents elsewhere, but it's still
heroically silly and effective, elegantly spelling out Guido's
ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   And his ambitions are simple. He wants to open a bookstore, and
he wants to find love. He bumps into Dora twice _ literally. It's
set in an Italy where the fascist movement is just coming into full
evil flower. Guido works as a waiter at the Grand Hotel with his
brother, and the two are determined to find a way out. But Guido's
willfulness is a kind of armor; it makes him impervious to almost
anything _ including success, despite his eagerness and craftiness.
But he does eventually win Dora, chanting ``Good morning,
Princess'' every time he sees her. It's after they're married and
are raising a very young son (Giorgio Cantarini, who has a long
face and expressive eyes) that things take a horrific turn. Guido
takes each anti-Semitic insult the pair encounters and spins it
into a harmless notion, finding the foolishness at the heart of
racism. His conniving has finally found a purpose, and he brings
perpetual delight to his boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life Is Beautiful'' is as ambitious as its protagonist. The
reach this story demands has raised the level of Benigni's
performance; maybe he just required a great subject all along. He's
certainly talented, but generally his movies are full of cheap,
knockabout comedy. Even when he tries a potentially scabrous
subject _ such as ``The Monster,'' in which he was mistaken for a
serial killer _ he undermines himself by going for the easy laugh.
There's a fair amount of that kind of thing in ``Life'' as well,
but this material seems to have sharpened his judgment.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Italy itself is the grandest film set any
director could possibly have, and seeing this scrappy comedian
exploit the handsome edifices for laughs and romance shows his real
love for his homeland. Benigni grows in our estimation as he courts
Dora and finds an opportunity for a laugh on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the jokes are a little cheesy, but ``Life'' is almost
breathless with joy during their courtship scene. His boundless
confidence makes much of the film play as if it were a fairy tale,
complete with the nightmarish specter around the corner and his
heedlessness.
</P>
<P>
   And the subject also functions as a better foundation for
Benigni's style. Guido's arrogant obliviousness and grinning
double-dealing is the knife that cuts through the potential
sentimentality; that smile plastered on Benigni's face makes him
look as if he swallowed one of the Joker's venoms. Because Benigni
has elevated the stakes, his imagination seems to fall short in the
last section, when Guido and his son are forced into a labor camp.
</P>
<P>
   Guido has to come up with a series of stories to convince his
little boy that the concentration camp is just a game, and that if
they can focus on behaving, a big prize is in store for them. It's
an audacious plotting gambit, a shocking turn on Scheherazade. But
in the camp, Benigni's direction becomes stylized and ``Life,''
which comes very close to being a great film, turns into a film
with a shockingly great premise. Guido's lies become a cute game,
because Benigni doesn't quite go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   It's as if he feels showing us the barracks is a substitute for
the brutality he doesn't show. If he had, ``Life Is Beautiful''
would go all the way to blistering grim comedy. Benigni probably
feels the power of the Holocaust functions in such visceral terms
that it does all his work for him. For perhaps the first time in
his career, Benigni displays some taste. In the end, he undermines
himself again. But it's a misstep after a series of victories.

THE VAMPIRE STRIKES BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TODD CAMP 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every few months or so, Hollywood unearths its favorite tale
from the crypt in the hope of giving a new set of choppers to the
musty, too-oft-told vampire legends.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, a director taps an undiscovered vein of
creativity, and we get modern treats such as Kathryn Bigelow's
vampire western ``Near Dark,'' Tom Holland's clever ``Fright
Night,'' Robert Rodriguez's sleazy bloodfeast ``From Dusk Till
Dawn'' or Joss Whedon's TV teen-angst-terrorfest ``Buffy the
Vampire Slayer.''
</P>
<P>
   So if any director could add a horrifying new wrinkle to the
bloodsucker mythos, it would be the man behind ``Halloween,''
right? Well, you might think that. You'd be wrong, of course, and
what you'd get is an anemic mess of goredom and boredom called
``John Carpenter's Vampires.''
</P>
<P>
   James Woods (who comes off as if he's doing his best
impersonation of Snake Plissken from Carpenter's ``Escape From New
York)'' is the ``good'' guy who's so ``bad'' you just have to say
to yourself, ``Man, this guy is SO bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Foul-mouthed, sociopathic, homophobic and sacrilegious, Woods'
vampire slayer Jack Crow is almost as vile as his prey _ but
apparently, you have to be that bad to slay vamps in this day and
age.
</P>
<P>
   After all, these aren't the well-dressed, wiseacre teeny-boppers
that Buffy and the Scooby squad hunt down on TV each week. They're
smelly, ugly, superstrong blood slurpers who don't sleep in
coffins, but instead bury themselves in the ground, emerging
zombie-style at sunset. And they can be killed only by a wooden
stake through the heart or by exposure to the purifying rays of the
sun.
</P>
<P>
   And when they catch some rays, whoo-ee, do these guys burn.
</P>
<P>
   Crow, scarred by his parents' murders by vamps, is the natural
leader of a pack of slayers who _ in one of the film's few neat
touches _ hunt ``goons,'' as they call 'em, under the blessing and
leadership of the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   When most of his crew is wiped out by a super-vamp called Valek
(Thomas Ian Griffith), Crow learns his new foe might be the oldest
known vampire alive ... er, dead ... uh, undead. And when he learns
of the creep's plans to find a way to walk the Earth during the day
with the help of an ancient relic, Crow's rag-tag band _ his sole
surviving team member (Daniel Baldwin), an inexperienced priest
(Tim Guinee) and a freshly bitten hooker (Sheryl Lee) _ don't seem
much of a match for the master's minions.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter knows how to lay on the action _ the explosive,
sun-exposed vampire deaths are cool, and the attacks are vicious,
bloody and, in some cases, rather frightening. But his bland
musical underscoring (Carpenter scored the film himself) destroys
any hope for dramatic impact that the scenes may have held, and the
droning monotony between confrontations makes the nearly two-hour
running time feel endless.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from a few novel ideas _ subterranean vampires and the
team's financial endorsement by the Catholic church _ ``Vampires''
offers little to add to the legacy of ``Dracula.'' So listen up,
movie moguls: Until the next ``Buffy'' TV crossover, let sleeping
vamps rest in peace for a while.

 By JANNY SCOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a song-and-dance number on Martin Short's 1989
television special, ``I, Martin Short, Goes Hollywood,'' that his
friend Dave Thomas believes exemplifies a central truth about
Short. It is a number in which the comic actor appears as an
unpainted wooden fence, wearing little more than a fig leaf and a
few slats.
</P>
<P>
   He is playing Dale O'Day, a supposedly ``legendary dancer's
dancer'' from the 1940s, who, the viewer is also told, would later
meet a tragic and untimely death crushed by furniture while dancing
on the ceiling in his unfinished last film, ``The Red Slip-ons.''
(He had forgotten to nail down the furniture before rotating the
room.)
</P>
<P>
   In the scene, Short skips, prances and gambols across the stage,
his slats flapping, then breaks into wild dancing. He leaps onto
hay bales, jumps between them, pirouettes _ all the while singing a
song called ``Man in the Moon'' to a small boy who has offered to
ask the man in the moon for some paint to cover the fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a classic I'm-Mr.-Showbiz song,'' recalled Thomas, an
actor who worked with Short in the Second City comedy troupe in
Toronto and on the television show ``SCTV Network.'' Thomas said he
thinks of Short as ``Mr. Showbiz'' _ a performer who can also sing,
dance, be funny, be serious and be dramatic, but who ``is
absolutely driven to entertain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has always been very difficult, in film and television and
the various mediums that he's performed in, for the vessel to
properly contain him,'' Thomas said. ``The best outlet I've ever
seen for Marty is the stage, where he can launch himself like a
rocket at the audience and give them in 3-D the full benefit of his
insanely manic energy.''
</P>
<P>
   On Broadway lately, Short has been lifting off every night in
previews of the Roundabout Theater Company revival of ``Little
Me,'' the 1962 musical comedy for which Neil Simon wrote the book.
</P>
<P>
   In the show, which opens on Nov. 12 at the Criterion Center
Stage Right, he plays not one but eight men in the life of Belle
Poitrine, nee Schlumpfert, the curvaceous beauty turned tell-all
memoirist from Drifter's Row (portrayed by Faith Prince).
</P>
<P>
   As those he works with know, Short is a master at appearing
spontaneous in a completely scripted situation and can keep an
audience wondering what will happen next. It is something he has
worked on, especially in theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved the consistency,'' he says, about his early years on
stage. ``I loved almost the discipline of duplication and the grand
scheme of making it fresh, making it appear like I had just made it
up.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, Short has his work cut out for him: there is Noble
Eggleston, an overachieving blueblood who cannot marry Belle until
she improves her social position; Amos Pinchley, an 88-year-old
Scrooge; Val du Val, a famous French singer; Otto Schnitzler, an
autocratic Hollywood director, and assorted others, including one
of the Buchsbaum brothers, vaudeville bookers.
</P>
<P>
   At one point the actor winds up a scene by expiring, as the
octogenarian Pinchley; rolls backward while the cast moves in front
of him; is dressed on his hands and knees in a new wig, hat, cigar,
glasses, jacket and padding; then materializes, behind a newspaper,
as a Buchsbaum _ all in 25 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Buchsbaum brothers were designed to give this insane actor
who has chosen to do seven roles a break,'' said Short over dinner
in a Japanese restaurant near the midtown Manhattan studio where he
was rehearsing. Despite the fact that he chose to skip the break
and take on one of the brothers (Michael McGrath plays the other),
he came across as thoughtful and quite sane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully,'' he said, ``the looks will be different and the
attitude and the vocal quality from character to character. I've
always been drawn to the kind of characterization that is very
three-dimensional. One of my idols is Peter Sellers in
`Strangelove,' where you literally saw him play three roles but it
could have been three different actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't just putting in funny teeth. It was fully evolved,
three-dimensional in appearance and behavior and position of
shoulders and a way of walking and talking. It was a totally
different person.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Little Me'' seems designed for Short, who made his name in the
early 1980s on ``SCTV'' and ``Saturday Night Live'' inventing an
entire cast of characters, like Jackie Rogers Jr., the albino
entertainer; Irving Cohen, the geriatric Tin Pan Alley songwriter,
and Ed Grimley, the endearing geek with the Dairy Queen-style coif.
</P>
<P>
   His humor capitalizes on the idiosyncrasies of character,
attitude and behavior. He is an admirer of the physicality of Dick
Van Dyke, the seamless realism of Lucille Ball. Actors describe him
as fearless and uninhibited. Christopher Guest, the actor and
director, calls him ``a clown in the best sense,'' unafraid to use
his physical talents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we're doing `Little Me' is because of Martin
Short,'' said its director, Rob Marshall, who directed the actor
last year in the acclaimed Encores concert version of the 1968
``Promises, Promises,'' with its book by Simon and music by Burt
Bacharach. ``Marty is one of those rare individuals who is a true
musical-theater star, and he can cross over from film to television
to musical theater effortlessly.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Short has done relatively little musical theater in the last
20 years. He began performing in musicals in Toronto during the
1970s but spent most of the 80s and 90s working in television and
film, doing sitcoms, sketch comedy, specials, an animated series
and movies, some critically admired but commercial flops.
</P>
<P>
   Only recently has he resurfaced on stage. Before ``Promises,
Promises,'' he had starred in 1993 with Bernadette Peters in ``The
Goodbye Girl.'' The Broadway musical version of Simon's 1977 film
received mixed reviews, though Short was highly praised.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great strengths he has,'' said Simon, ``is that he
is extremely warm and likable, which one doesn't always find with
other comedians. The other thing that he has the ability to do and
that no one has been able to do who has played this part is to
sing, and to sing really well.''
</P>
<P>
   So why hasn't Short done more musical theater on Broadway?
</P>
<P>
   The reasons, he said, are both personal and professional. First,
he lives with his wife, Nancy Dolman, and their three children,
ages 14, 12 and 9, in Los Angeles, not New York, and he would
consider himself to have failed in life if he were ever to look
back and say: ``I have four Tonys. If only I'd been there for the
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   But his career choices also reflect the state of musical theater
today. The increasing dominance of television and film, combined
with the evolution of popular taste and the enormous expense of
mounting Broadway shows, have helped dry up the supply of the kind
of larger-than-life roles that were written for comic actors like
Sid Caesar, Ethel Merman and Bert Lahr.
</P>
<P>
   Musical comedies used to be much more star-driven, said Bert
Fink, a vice president at the Rodgers and Hammerstein Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we have lost, to a certain degree,'' Fink said, ``is
the star vehicle. One way the British invasion of the 1980s
transformed the landscape is that musicals like ``Cats,'' ``Les
Miserables'' and ``The Phantom of the Opera'' are not about the
stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging the somewhat unexpected directions his career has
taken, Short talked over dinner about the freedom of theater, the
forgivingness of television, the frustrations of film. At 48, he
has the animated features, rubbery athleticism and eager
expressiveness of a small boy.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived at the restaurant wearing sneakers, jeans and an
oversized plaid shirt _ at 5 feet 8 inches tall, a puckish figure
with a large angular nose and humorous mouth. Though he is known as
an almost perfect talk-show guest, brimming with stories and
impressions, he spoke quite seriously about his family, his life
and his work.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Movies are a director's medium, not an actor's, Short said. A
film might take years and $40 million to make, and end up seeming
less funny than 15 minutes spent promoting it on the ``Late Show
With David Letterman.'' By contrast, he said, an actor can do
``Saturday Night Live,'' the sketch bombs and the next week he is
on the show again.
</P>
<P>
   ``To work in comedy, you have to accept that your percentage of
failure is going to be high,'' Short said, estimating that 60
percent to 70 percent of what a comic actor does will not be a
commercial success. ``You have to forget that part, or you would
never do insane things.''
</P>
<P>
   The youngest of five children, Short grew up in Hamilton,
Ontario. His father was an Irish immigrant who became a steel
company executive; his mother was the concertmistress of the
Hamilton Philharmonic Orchestra. Everyone in his family was funny,
Short said; he considers himself a beneficiary of ``trickle-down
comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on, he became fascinated by show business. At 14, he was
recording ``The Martin Short Show'' on a tape recorder in his
bedroom in the attic of the family home. He would ``chat with''
celebrity guests like Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett, dub in
applause, then air the show for his family at 8:30 p.m. every other
Monday. He was alternating with Andy Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Taping was not uncommon in the Short household. Family members
regularly recorded funny interviews and instant musicals. At 16,
Short taped most of Christmas. Within four years, both of his
parents were dead; his oldest brother had died when Short was 12.
</P>
<P>
   He still plays the tapes around Christmas, the sound of his
childhood piped in through speakers in the ceiling of his home
office in Pacific Palisades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have this philosophy about losing loved ones,'' Short said.
``If you start out with this idea that we're all going to die, the
next step is to say, `Hi, Mom,' every day and you put pictures all
over the place and you listen to tapes. I never felt that these
people, part of my childhood, ever went away. They never left.''
</P>
<P>
   Short studied social work at McMaster University in Hamilton and
acted constantly in campus productions. He says he had not
considered acting as a profession: ``To me, actors lived in the
United States.'' But during his senior year, a friend, Eugene Levy,
already an actor, encouraged him. His first audition was for the
original Toronto production of ``Godspell.''
</P>
<P>
   The auditions were held in a Masonic temple. Gilda Radner, yet
to be discovered, arrived in pigtails and sang
``Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah.'' Short sang ``My Funny Valentine.'' They were
both hired, along with Paul Shaffer, now David Letterman's
bandleader, who was there to play the piano for a girlfriend and
ended up being enlisted as musical director. Victor Garber played
Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   The production was a hit and Short began a seven-year stint of
acting in Toronto _ everything from musical theater and Shakespeare
on radio to industrial films. He spent two of those years as a
member of the Second City comedy troupe, from which Ms. Radner and
Dan Aykroyd had recently moved to ``Saturday Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Short decided to expand his career _ ``As we Canadians
say, `Do the South' '' _ and went to New York, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``My real plan was to do theater,'' he recalled. But, he said,
when he looked at theater in New York in the late 70s and early
80s, ``I didn't really see a place for me there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had gone into the `Chorus Line'/`Cats' phase of Broadway,
which was a far cry from Ray Bolger, say, or Nathan Lane. I felt a
little bit like, `Gee, isn't it a drag that I wasn't born 15 years
earlier.' ''
</P>
<P>
   What did present itself was television. He was offered a major
role in ``The Associates,'' a sitcom produced by James L. Brooks,
the co-creator of ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show.'' When that was
canceled, more offers followed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Short joined ``SCTV,'' the show that is considered to
have launched the careers of everyone from John Candy and Harold
Ramis to Catherine O'Hara.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to ``Saturday Night Live'' in 1984, stayed one year and
has been credited with helping to save the show from possible
extinction. Then he quit, saying he was leaving to make movies and
perhaps a Broadway musical.
</P>
<P>
   The movies got made. So did the television specials. But by
1987, he and his family had settled in Los Angeles and by 1989,
with the children and numerous professional commitments, it was
becoming increasingly difficult to pick up and move to New York for
the commitment a Broadway show required.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had offered me `Forum' instead of Nathan Lane _ which
they didn't, but had they _ I probably would not have been able to
do it,'' Short said, about the 1996 Broadway revival of ``A Funny
Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum.'' ``I would have been lined
up for movies, and also I would have said, `I can't move to New
York for a year.' '' As only one part of the Roundabout season,
``Little Me'' requires a commitment of four months, Short said.
</P>
<P>
   Simon has extensively reworked ``Little Me,'' which he adapted
from the novel of the same name by Patrick Dennis. It was Simon's
first musical book, which he wrote originally for Sid Caesar (with
Cy Coleman and Carolyn Leigh as the composer and lyricist).
</P>
<P>
   He remembered things that had not worked in the original
production and the short-lived 1982 revival on Broadway. ``When you
do a show again, you rewrite it,'' Simon said. ``You're getting
another chance at it.'' About specific changes, he said simply,
``There are 120 pages of things.'' But he stressed that he wanted
to capitalize on the talents of Short.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said of his friend: ``He's got more than his share of
life energy bursting out of his body. Where else except in person
and on stage would you want to see that? Why would you want to
record it on tape or flatten it out on celluloid when you can see
it in real life?''

<P>
   Faculty members at Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn, N.Y.,
huddled one morning this semester in the education department's
Africana Resource Center, a small conference room lined with stacks
of multicultural books.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion was one of the college's ``teaching circles,''
meetings among faculty members from various departments _ on this
day, chemistry, English and math _ aimed at finding ways to
strengthen programs in the face of a looming crisis: Medgar Evers'
teacher-education program, like many other colleges' throughout the
state, faces decertification unless it improves.
</P>
<P>
   The dominant topic at the meeting was literacy. Everyone talked
about getting students to ``write across the curriculum,'' a buzz
phrase here and elsewhere that means giving students more reading
and writing assignments in all classes, even science and math.
</P>
<P>
   Then the discussion turned, as it often does, to the future and
to the hurdles the school must overcome to prepare tomorrow's
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many students do not know how to do the simplest algebra, and
that's true of science majors, too,'' said John Flowers, a
professor of physical science and computer science.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many of my students come to us without having read a whole
book,'' said Zala Chandler, an English literature professor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are afraid of math; they are afraid of arithmetic; I'm
not saying anything about geometry,'' said Tatyana Flesher, a math
professor. ``If they carry this attitude to the classroom, you will
maybe have kids who don't know geometry.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Simmons, the chairman of the education department, is
familiar with such laments, given the fact that many of the
students throughout the college come from some of New York City's
most academically inferior schools in some of its poorest
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the City University of New York's fabled and fading
open-admissions policy, the education program is taking a tack
being repeated on teacher-education campuses across the country: it
is raising its admissions and curriculum standards _ even at the
cost of turning away students, something the program has rarely
done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are interested in quality at this point,'' Dr. Simmons
said.
</P>
<P>
   And for good reason. Like three other CUNY campuses _ York,
Lehman and City College _ Medgar Evers is positioned to lose its
right to train teachers if it does not meet new state standards.
Among the new benchmarks it must reach is insuring that 80 percent
or more of its graduates pass the state's licensing examinations,
beginning in 1999; the schools get three years to shape up. But
last year, just 41 percent at Medgar Evers passed the liberal arts
exam _ the worst performance in the state after City College, at 40
percent, and Boricua College in Manhattan, at 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The anxiety at New York's teacher colleges is not unique, nor is
the soul-searching about the teachers they are sending out and the
students they are letting in. Schools across the nation are taking
a hard look at their curriculums, with many shifting emphasis from
a theoretical approach to practical experience, and state after
state is introducing or toughening licensing examinations and
mandating higher standards in what amounts to an all-out assault on
education programs and budding teachers.
</P>
<P>
   _This summer Pennsylvania enacted reforms that include requiring
prospective teachers to maintain a B average in liberal arts
courses before they can be admitted to a training program and a B
in the subject they wish to teach. (Some colleges had been
admitting students with a C-minus average.)
</P>
<P>
   _Last spring Massachusetts introduced its first-ever
certification exam; nearly 60 percent flunked, and educators and
politicians have been fighting about the test and how to improve
teacher education ever since.
</P>
<P>
   _This fall a Texas law went into effect requiring 70 percent of
an institution's graduates _ and 70 percent of each racial and
ethnic group _ to pass the state's certification exam or face
probation. Of the state's 86 teacher colleges, 35 did not measure
up, threatening their accreditation if they do not improve their
rates within three years.
</P>
<P>
   _If the 80 percent requirement for New York's 113
teacher-education programs were in effect today, at least two dozen
colleges would lose accreditation, including four campuses of CUNY,
the main supplier of teachers for New York City public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Raising standards is a trend that will surely intensify another
expected crisis: a growing shortage of teachers. Nationwide, some
200,000 new teachers will be needed within the next 10 years. In
New York City alone, officials estimate that they will need to hire
30,000 within the next five years to fill gaps created by growing
enrollments, retirements and people leaving the profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you raise the bar, fewer people will get over it,'' said
David Imig, the executive director of the American Association of
Colleges for Teacher Education, based in Washington. ``The reality
comes every Tuesday after Labor Day, when you've got vacancies in
classrooms that have to be staffed.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate on how to turn out quality teachers has long
bedeviled educators. It arises periodically, usually after the
nation goes into spasms over the quality of education as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   It happened after the Civil War, with the rise of
industrialization and the shift in skills needed as American
workers migrated from the farm to the factory.
</P>
<P>
   It happened after Sputnik, when the Soviet Union's launch of the
first satellite was taken as a sign of the poor quality of American
math and science education.
</P>
<P>
   And it is happening anew, with test results showing that
American students are behind their peers in other industrialized
nations on math and science, and lagging in literacy.

FOR YOUR HALLOWEEN PARTY, HERE'S SOME THINGS TO DO TO KEEP YOU
SPOOKED

<TEXT>
<P>
   Every Halloween party needs frightful, fun activities. From TV
terror to a spooky story, here are some suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Small-screen scares
</P>
<P>
   Sunnydale's finest take over MTV Saturday night for ``Buffy the
Vampire Slayer Presents: Videos That Don't Suck.'' Stars of the hit
WB show _ Sarah Michelle Gellar, Alyson Hannigan, Nicholas Brendon,
David Boreanaz, Charisma Carpenter and Seth Green _ host the
four-hour special from the ``Buffy'' set, which will include the
casts' favorite videos, clips &UR;  &LR; from the show and a tour of
Sunnydale High. &UR;  &LR; The block first airs Saturday, from noon &UR;  &LR; to 4
p.m. EST, and repeats later, from 7 to 11 p.m. EST
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; And the winner is . . .
</P>
<P>
   Make sure your guests dress to impress by including a costume
contest as part of the fun. Pick your categories ahead of time and
include contest information on the invitation.
</P>
<P>
   You can stick with traditional categories like ``scariest
costume'' or ``funniest costume.'' Or get creative with categories
like ``best TV villain'' (such as Spike from ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer'') or ``best rock star'' (such as Billy Corrigan from
Smashing Pumpkins).
</P>
<P>
   Prizes are important. CDs, T-shirts or gift certificates would
be cool. We know you're not made of money, so have each guest bring
a prize to throw in a grab bag.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Tell these fortunes
</P>
<P>
   These instructions, adapted from ``The Kids Guide to Fortune
Telling'' (Kids Can, $5.95) will surely help you spook your guests.
You'll need a lemon, a small bowl, a toothpick, small strips of
paper, a box and a candle.
</P>
<P>
   1. Squeeze the lemon's juice into the bowl. Dip the toothpick in
the juice and use the toothpick to write a short fortune (about
money, travel, a new pet, good luck, a surprise, trouble, success,
etc.) on each of the slips of paper. Make enough slips for all your
guests.
</P>
<P>
   2. Let the slips dry. This might take up to 30 minutes. Place
the slips of paper in the box and mix them up.
</P>
<P>
   3. Have each friend choose a fortune.
</P>
<P>
   4. Warm each slip of paper over a burning candle (be careful!).
The fortune will appear as the heat from the flame darkens the
lemon juice.
</P>
<P>
   5. Once the word appears, make up a spooky fortune to match.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Spooky storytelling
</P>
<P>
   Read Edgar Allan Poe's classic poem ``The Raven.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Killer tunes
</P>
<P>
   Kick back and listen to some scary music. How about:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hellbilly Deluxe'' _ The new solo CD by Rob Zombie is campy,
sort of like heavy metal meets ``The Night of the Living Dead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gallore'' _ It's hard to go wrong with any of the Cure's mope
rock, but this CD features the band's best singles from 1987 to
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Halloween: 20th Anniversary Edition'' _ ``Halloween H20'' may
be way too scary to watch at this party, but the soundtrack is just
spooky enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Halloween Hootenanny'' _ Just released, this CD features songs
by the Amazing Royal Crowns, Los Straightjackets, the Ghastly Ones
and other creepy bands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Halloween Hits'' _ With this CD, you'll get classics such as
``Monster Mash,'' ``The Purple People Eater'' and the
``Ghostbusters'' theme. &QL;

WEB SITES REPORT PROBLEMS WITH NEW MAC SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Apple Computer Inc. is investigating a software
glitch that reportedly has affected some computers using the new
Mac OS 8.5 operating system.
</P>
<P>
   According to two Web sites widely used by Apple enthusiasts, the
highly promoted operating system software has been erasing data and
damaging hard drives in a variety of Macintosh computers, including
Apple's PowerBook laptops and desktop PowerPC models.
</P>
<P>
   Most consumers are reporting no problems with the system, but it
has prompted warnings and discussion among users on the MacFixIt
and MacInTouch Web sites, both considered to be authoritative
sources for Macintosh computer repair and upgrade information.
</P>
<P>
   MacInTouch (www.macintouch.com) has been posting warnings for
the last week, reporting that users have lost data and experienced
other glitches after the installation of the upgrade. Other
problems include the loss of desktop icons and formatting
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Apple spokesman Russell Brady said the company was reviewing the
reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard of the complaints,'' Brady said, ``and we're
investigating. We're trying to see if we can replicate any issues.
But so far, nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Brady said the company was seeking systems that have shown the
glitch but that it had not been able to locate a machine that was
failing under the Mac OS 8.5 software.
</P>
<P>
   No one seems to know why the software has caused problems in
some machines but not others. ``There isn't anything you can tell
someone to do that will solve the problem,'' said Ted Landau, who
runs MacFixIt (www.macfixit.com), the other Mac enthusiast site.
``There's not a common thread that anyone has found, so far.''
</P>
<P>
   One Mac dealer said he was mystified by the reports. David
Torres, a sales associate at the San Francisco-based MACadam store,
said he had yet to see a flaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard about that, but we've been running OS 8.5 on all
our machines here, and so far, nothing,'' Torres said.
</P>
<P>
   The reported problem centers on the hard drives of various
Macintosh computers, according to a detailed message on the
MacFixIt site posted by Kennedy Brandt, a technician with the
UMax/SuperMac company, a former manufacturer of Macintosh clones
and peripherals that is based in Fremont, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Brandt said the UMax/SuperMac lab had detected the bug, but then
was able to replicate it again on only six of 47 drives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bizarre,'' Brandt said. ``The fact that we've seen it,
but can't make it happen on identical setups, is really, really
puzzling.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandt said the problem appeared to stem from software, called
drivers, that tell the computer how to read and write data to a
hard drive. When that software becomes scrambled, the computer
cannot properly retrieve data from the drive. In some cases, the
corruption can be so severe, the hard disk is rendered unusable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some cases have reached that level,'' Brandt said. ``But we
can't get it to repeat itself.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey of its users, MacInTouch stated that the
bug had been seen in a wide range of Macintosh computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problems affect all systems _ Power Macs, clones and
PowerBooks,'' the site reported.
</P>
<P>
   The MacInTouch Web site advises Mac OS 8.5 users to back up all
data before upgrading. Additionally, the site says a ``clean
install,'' which involves erasing the hard drive completely before
installing 8.5, may solve the problem.

 UNDATED: in literacy.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest bout of concern is traced to the 1983 report ``A
Nation at Risk,'' produced by the National Commission on Excellence
in Education, which called poor teachers a significant obstacle to
the preparation of elementary and secondary school students.
</P>
<P>
   Until the report, policy makers and educators had paid attention
primarily to what children were doing in the classroom, not who was
telling them how to do it. Teachers are now increasingly seen as
the missing component in the drive to raise academic standards in
elementary and secondary schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a growing body of empirical evidence of how important
teaching is, as opposed to everything else,'' said Charles Lenth,
the director of higher education for the Education Commission of
the States, a Denver-based nonprofit organization that studies
state education issues. ``You can raise standards, but if you don't
have good teachers, you won't make progress.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of failing New York's three-part, eight-hour
certification exams caused Sharon Johnson, a Medgar Evers student
who hopes to teach special education, to stay up all night crying
on the eve of the tests last semester.
</P>
<P>
   Among students, there is a renewed respect for the exams, which
measure knowledge in the liberal arts and sciences, the subject to
be taught and teaching skills. Many have tried to take the tests
cold, without studying guides or sample questions, or taking
preparation courses offered on campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a technique to taking this test,'' said Ms. Johnson,
who passed and is scheduled to graduate in January. ``If you are
used to book learning, you are not going to pass this test. You
need a strategy like a person preparing for medical-board tests.''
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Hoyle, 38, chose Medgar Evers after a year at City
College, where she felt lost among the school's 2,500 education
students. Like many of her fellow students, she is a mother _ she
has two daughters, 18 and 9 _ and has worked as a teacher's aide.
Once so shy that she quit a speech class because it required an
oral presentation to her classmates, Ms. Hoyle now laughs at the
episode and chats freely, a change she credits partly to a
close-knit, nurturing atmosphere at school.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating in June, she wants to work as an elementary
school teacher. But she, too, felt that her dream was being frayed
by the certification exams. She failed to prepare the first time
she took them in February, figuring her class work would stand her
in good stead. She failed the liberal arts and science test by
three points, crushing her spirit. ``I was sick,'' she said. ``I
could not believe I failed the exam.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it did show me my weakness,'' she added. ``At Medgar Evers
we are taught to write essays a certain way, with an introduction,
a thesis and three supporting details, but that's not what they
wanted. It was more like summarize what you read and then give your
opinion.'' Ms. Hoyle passed the exam on her second try.
</P>
<P>
   As elsewhere, students at Medgar Evers did far better on the
portion that was focused on teaching method and subject area than
on the part designed to measure knowledge of the liberal arts. And
some CUNY institutions did relatively well on all the exams,
including the liberal arts and sciences exam. For instance, at
Queens College, whose students are drawn heavily from Queens and
suburban Long Island, 88 percent passed.
</P>
<P>
   There is no easy measure of whether teachers are actually less
able, since many exams are new or have been radically changed. That
the tests don't judge teaching ability so much as general knowledge
was a criticism heard after recent poor showings at some schools in
New York and Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand the public's need to sort of have a sense
that teachers are qualified and knowledgeable in their fields,''
said Joseph Caruso, the chairman of the education department at
Framingham State College in Massachusetts. But as a society we
place too much emphasis on tests.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the sweat over the exam, Ms. Hoyle does not regret her
decision to enter teaching or Medgar Evers, founded in 1969 in the
ferment of the civil rights movement and named after the slain
Mississippi civil rights leader. The college has long been proud of
its service to the African-American community, including sponsoring
an annual conference of black writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make sense to me to teach in Canarsie or Howard
Beach and then come home and look at the kids in my community,
where I live, who need me,'' she said. ``I want to graduate from
Medgar Evers and say I went to a predominantly black college, and I
want to work in my community.''
</P>
<P>
   Some administrators doubt that the state would ever really close
education programs, and indeed the state is considering changing
the way it calculates which test-takers would count toward the 80
percent cutoff, which could inflate pass rates. Nonetheless, all
the threatened colleges are seeking to raise admissions standards,
and suffering the consequences _ a drop-off in the number of
eligible students.
</P>
<P>
   This year, for instance, entering Medgar Evers students needed a
minimum 2.5 overall grade point average _ and a 3.0 in English
classes _ out of 4.0; previously, students with overall averages as
low as 2.3 could get in. And in a departure from previous years,
all students were required to pass CUNY's basic skills test before
they were accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have discussed raising the required GPA to 2.7 but are
reluctant, for fear of turning away even more students and
departing from the college's open-door spirit. Although the college
has not taken its census yet, Dr. Simmons says she is certain fewer
students are entering the program, which had about 900 students
last spring. Some courses had to be canceled this year because too
few signed up.
</P>
<P>
   Mwalimu J. Shujaa, dean of the school of liberal arts and
education, says losing the teaching program would set back efforts
to diversify the teaching work force, which is overwhelmingly white
in New York (66 percent) and the nation (87 percent). Educators
believe that a diverse teaching force would better respond to the
increasingly diverse student population.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure you are aware of the national profile of teachers,''
Dr. Shujaa said. White, female, suburban.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you need a lot of teachers but don't want to pay much, what
do you do?'' said Richard Soder, a professor of education at the
University of Washington in Seattle, who has studied
teacher-training and hiring. ``You go to women and make sure the
training is not significant, because they might find grounding for
areas where they make more money.''

 UNDATED: more money.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Indeed, the public school teaching work force of 2.7 million
nationwide is more than three-quarters female. And although some
states are seeking to raise teacher pay, the average beginning
salary remains well below that for fields like business and
computers.
</P>
<P>
   It has always been a struggle to attract top-flight teaching
candidates. Even within universities, support and respect for
education programs go lacking.
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1997 National Center for Education Statistics
report, based on 1992-93 data, students in education programs
tested into remedial college courses at higher rates _ 18 percent
took remedial math, compared with 11 percent of majors in the
humanities and social science, and 13 percent took remedial
English, compared with 7 percent of humanities and social science
majors. Education students' entrance exam scores are also lower,
with about half as many education majors in the top quartile as
humanities and social science majors.
</P>
<P>
   John Silber, the chairman of the Massachusetts Board of
Education, put it rather tartly during a summer meeting of
education school deans smarting over the poor performance of
students on that state's teacher certification exams. ``Education
programs have a reputation as a place for dum-dums,'' he said, and
are considered ``the laughing stock by serious scholars.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We ought to take that to heart.''
</P>
<P>
   An additional problem is that universities do not tend to pour
money into their educational programs, which are relatively
inexpensive to run, requiring little in the way of equipment and
other resources in comparison with, say, chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``These places are cash cows,'' said Linda Darling-Hammond,
director of the National Commission on Teaching and America's
Future, based at Teachers College at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   The National Center for Education Statistics reports that
education professors are paid, on average, $11,000 less a year than
their peers in other departments. And colleges spend about $100
less per student credit-hour on education programs than for
engineering, though tuition is generally the same.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike medical or law schools, education programs are also not
required to be certified or accredited by a professional board,
although there is a move to change that. Of the 1,300
teacher-education institutions, about 500 have been accredited
voluntarily by the National Council for the Accreditation of
Teacher Education, a Washington-based professional organization
that conducts rigorous review of their faculties, curriculums and
student populations.
</P>
<P>
   Two states, North Carolina and Arkansas, require the council's
accreditation, and several others, including New York, now strongly
advise it, said Arthur Wise, the group's president. Only four
institutions in New York State _ Fordham, Hofstra, and Niagara
universities and the State University College at Buffalo _ are
accredited by the council.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the major crop to sprout from the baked earth of far
west Texas has been cotton, grown on great big farms that splash
green and white on the otherwise brown and crimson moonscape.
</P>
<P>
   Now the folks ``up at the college'' _ the University of Texas at
El Paso _ are trying to seed something else entirely, all in the
name of better educating the farmers and working-class residents
along the Mexican border.
</P>
<P>
   The university, recognized by the United States Department of
Education in its ``Promising Practices'' report on teacher
education in September, is growing a teaching hospital, but one
that aims to turn out teachers rather than doctors. And, to carry
the analogy further, the E.R.'s where the interns apply theory to
practice are schools like H.D. Hilley Elementary, right in the
middle of a cotton field in nearby Socorro.
</P>
<P>
   There, Maribel Alarcon, a student teacher, huddled on a recent
day with a pack of sixth graders who measured and snipped and
folded their multicolored construction paper into origami, all in
the name of geometry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you see the triangles?'' she asked as they twisted and
turned their frogs and whales to find the shapes. ``Is there a
parallelogram in there?''
</P>
<P>
   Taking a breather, Ms. Alarcon summed up the value of the
classroom experience: ``On campus we got a lot of theory, but here
we have hands-on practice with the kids. This gives us real
approaches.''
</P>
<P>
   It is such approaches that educators hail as the wave of the
future for education schools, which have been looking inward to
find ways to improve the way they themselves teach.
</P>
<P>
   Education students, like those with other majors, usually spend
the first couple of years taking a college's core requirement of
arts and sciences courses, like English and math, with the last two
years devoted to education classes. In this latter period, they
have traditionally done an 8-to-12-week ``student teaching''
experience at a school, and also taken courses that focus on
theory, methods of instruction and, in many cases,
multiculturalism.
</P>
<P>
   Most campuses devote considerable class time to teaching
student-centered learning, a method of instruction that discourages
teachers from standing in front of the classroom to lecture;
instead, they are taught to engage youngsters in group discussions
and activities that encourage the children to ask questions and
find their own answers, with guidance rather than instruction from
the teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be a sage on the stage, be a guide on the side,'' is how
Stephanie Hadley, an El Paso student, put it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old way was teacher-directed, where they don't ask kids to
do anything,'' said Carmen Rotchford, another student, as if
recalling a bad memory. But they just lecture and stand up there in
the front of the class.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as their science-education teacher, Sally Blake, explained:
``Do you want kids that can do rote memorization, or do you want
ones that can think? You want ones that can think.''
</P>
<P>
   In her class, it is not unusual to see students doing the very
activities they would require of their pupils. One day last month,
for instance, her students found themselves doing a minute's worth
of jumping jacks, but not to limber up. They broke up into groups
of three: one student did the jacks; another counted them; and a
third recorded the time at intervals throughout the minute. The
goal was to measure the changing rate over time, and prepare a bar
graph showing the results. In most cases, the pace of the jacks
slowed over the course of the minute. ``It's something physical, as
opposed to word problems,'' Professor Blake said.
</P>
<P>
   Other education courses typically involve classroom management
and diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Downstairs from Professor Blake's class, Virginia Gonzalez
teaches ``Critical Pedagogy,'' whose reading list includes titles
like ``Pedagogy of the Oppressed,'' by Paulo Freire. In this class,
she said, they learn to respect students' viewpoints and to become
mindful of the displays of cultural diversity seen in a classroom,
like Hispanic immigrants' reluctance to question authority figures,
like teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a critical theorist, you are constantly deconstructing,''
she tells her pupils. ``You are creating a learning space for your
students. You are not defining them and saying, `You sit here and
this is what you do.' ''

 UNDATED: you do.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Across the country, schools are reducing the number of such
courses, which have drawn ridicule from conservative scholars like
Silber, who would rather see education students spend more time
learning English and math than learning what he calls overly soft,
touchy-feely approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are moving away from the Mickey Mouse courses that always
focus on development and method and not enough on content,'' said
Richard Kunkel, dean of the College of Education at Auburn
University in Alabama and executive director of the Holmes
Partnership, a consortium of 120 universities seeking ways to
improve teacher education. ``Good training has a balance of content
and practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Arturo Pacheco, the dean of El Paso's education school, defends
the method courses as necessary to give teachers a grounding in how
to approach their students and develop lessons. Nonetheless, the
college in the last few years has scaled back on such on-campus
classes in favor of a field-based approach. ``Teachers are now
prepared more like doctors and nurses, and less like philosophers
or historians,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, medical schools are seen as models for
teacher-preparation programs, which are driven more and more by the
need to strike a better balance between teaching theories of
learning and giving education students more practical, clinical
experience in elementary and secondary classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The National Commission on Teaching and America's Future
recommended such an approach in a report last year, suggesting that
field experience be increased to a full school year instead of the
typical half year, but under close supervision from instructors or
``mentor teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   The report did not suggest abandoning theory and methodology
courses, and to strong programs like El Paso's, striking a balance
is key.
</P>
<P>
   Even El Paso, though, has not been immune to the drive to raise
standards. The education program has raised its minimum grade point
average for admission (and staying in) to 2.5 from 2.25, and is
requiring its 1,500 students to take additional math and science
classes. El Paso has met the new state requirement, posting a 78
percent overall success rate on the certification exam, and about
70 percent for each minority group, including Hispanics, the
largest group on campus.
</P>
<P>
   The education program has restructured in the last few years,
with the centerpiece the drive to increase preparation in the
field. In keeping with the teaching-hospital model, seniors are
called interns and spend about 600 to 700 hours in the field _
double what they used to _ at 25 ``partner'' schools.
</P>
<P>
   They are like Christine Dalby, one of 13 interns spending this
semester at Ascarate Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not imagine not having this experience,'' said Ms.
Dalby, who found an answer to managing classroom discipline in
Renee Reszel's sixth-grade room. ``At the beginning of the class,
she didn't discuss rules or anything like that. Instead, she works
on the point system, where they get points for good behavior. It's
all positive reinforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   But reality often clashes with the high ideals espoused in the
lecture hall.
</P>
<P>
   Colleges can instill in their students the best theory, the
latest in methodology, but the effect of the teacher reform
movement boils down to what happens when schools send their new
recruits out to face veteran teachers and administrators suspicious
of different ways of thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Take Ms. Hadley, the enthusiastic intern determined not to be a
``sage on the stage.''
</P>
<P>
   One day she was helping a veteran teacher at an elementary
school with an exercise in which the pupils had to read a passage
and then answer questions about it. Taking the initiative, Ms.
Hadley saw an opportunity to make the lesson ``more connected to
real-life experience,'' she said. The passage dealt with developing
a ``world calendar,'' a reconfigured 364-day calendar in which
numbered days of the month fall on the same weekday each year.
</P>
<P>
   So Ms. Hadley had the students design their own calendars.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought it was neat,'' she said. ``Their birthdays fell
the same day every year.''
</P>
<P>
   But inevitably, theory bumps into practice. What feedback did
she get from the more tradition-bound classroom teacher?
</P>
<P>
   ``She called me a twit.'' &QC;

Times News Service for Friday, Oct. 30.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FEATURES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MOMA-POLLOCK-EXHIBIT (New York) _ The Jackson Pollock show at
the Museum of Modern Art. The retrospective, a landmark, is nearly
perfect. Restraint is pointless. If you care about art you live for
exhibitions like this, in which an artist, against the heavy odds
of his own skewed talent and unhinged personality, pursued
something so wild, untested and mysterious that its full meaning
was unclear even to him, yet who briefly wrung from his peculiar
system of painting one variation after another. By Michael
Kimmelman.
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON-GRAVES (Boston) _ Time flies. Remember you must die.
Those words are carved in stone, a few steps from busy Tremont
Street. The phrases are actually in Latin (``Fugit hora, memento
mori''), but their meaning is vividly clear by what appears beneath
them, a carving of Father Time with an hourglass and a skeleton
with an arrow, both reaching to snuff out a candle. The scene turns
up a few times on the gravestones in King's Chapel Burying Ground,
Boston's oldest graveyard, which I recently visited on a tour of
historic graveyards in and around Boston. By Gustav Niebuhr.

<P>
   NY-ETHNIC-THEATER (New York) _ For a place as wildly diverse as
New York, the city's major commercial theater can often seem
considerably less so. Sure, ``The Beauty Queen of Leenane'' is an
Irish play, and ``Art'' is French. The list, and the world, seem
pretty much to end right there. But while Broadway's idea of exotic
fare may be a West End import, in neighborhoods throughout the
city, smaller nonprofit theaters are serving up a feast of original
work, seldom-seen plays and new translations from a wide variety of
ethnic backgrounds. By Jesse McKinley.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY-VIOLIN (New York) _ Probably the first thing to know
about the English violinist Nigel Kennedy is that having returned
to the classical concert stage after a five-year self-imposed
exile, during which he worked almost exclusively on rock projects,
he is no longer using his first name. ``I suppose it was partially
a contemptuous thing to do, to rile the British critics,'' Kennedy
said during a recent stopover in New York, before starting a tour
that includes a run of performances with the New York Philharmonic
and a recital at Avery Fisher Hall this weekend. By Allan Kozinn.
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   WHITNEY-REORG (New York) _ It did not take long for Maxwell L.
Anderson, the new director of the Whitney Museum of American Art,
to start making his mark. After less than 60 days on the job,
Anderson has announced changes in the museum's curatorial and
management organizations that will add more rigor to programming
decisions, decentralize decision making and require hiring two
curators and three senior administrators. By Judith H. Dobrzynski.

FORMER CONGRESSMAN BATTLES TO REGAIN SEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDEN GROVE, Calif. _ The way Robert K. Dornan sees it, the
true Latino in the 46th Congressional District race has pasty white
skin, four Irish grandparents and nearly a dozen visits to the
Emerald Isle under his belt.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate's name also happens to be Bob Dornan.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to win back his congressional seat, Dornan, a Republican,
is out to convince voters in this largely Catholic Hispanic
district that he is more in tune with them than US Representative
Loretta Sanchez, the Democratic congresswoman he still insists
stole the election from him in 1996. To have a chance in the
closely watched race, which has drawn campaign donations from
around the nation, he will have to be convincing.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking boisterous but broken Spanish, Dornan wades into
Hispanic neighborhoods to shake hands. He talks up his trips to
Mexico, Nicaragua and other countries of concern to his former
constituents. A recent campaign mailing even featured an image of
the revered Virgin of Guadalupe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course my genes are Irish,'' Dornan said. ``But in spirit,
in temperament, in life experience, I am closer to Latinos than is
a shopper from a fancy neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the real thing,'' he added, citing his Catholic church
attendance and staunch opposition to abortion. ``She's the phony.''
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders and the ``shopper,'' as Dornan slightingly labels
Sanchez, scoff at his assertions, saying Dornan's emphasis on
``authenticity'' only alienates the Hispanic voters he is trying to
woo. And he has already alienated them plenty.
</P>
<P>
   After losing the 1996 election by 984 votes, Dornan charged that
hundreds of noncitizens, mostly Hispanics, illegally cast ballots
for Sanchez, who is Mexican-American. The House Contested Elections
Task Force investigated and found improper ballots, but said there
were too few to overturn the election. Still, political observers
and operatives said, enemies had been made in a community that the
65-year-old Dornan now needs and that the Republican Party is
intent on proving it can appeal to at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's great because he consistently makes the same mistakes,''
said Art Torres, chairman of the California Democratic Party. ``The
whole Virgin of Guadalupe thing backfired; it offended people and
the church because her image isn't supposed to be used for partisan
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides, in fact, agree that Dornan's presence in the race,
and his reputation for take-no-prisoners remarks and Cold War
conservatism, has benefited Sanchez in more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the 38-year-old freshman and former financial
consultant has received donations from people as intent on keeping
Dornan off the House floor as Sanchez on it. Her spokesman, Lee
Godown, went so far as to say people write her checks ``because
they hate Bob Dornan.'' Sanchez was unavailable for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   So far this election season, Sanchez has raised about $2.75
million to Dornan's $3 million, which includes the $320,000 the
oversight committee returned to him for the legal cost of his voter
fraud challenge. President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore have
also put in appearances on her behalf in the central Orange County
district, about 50 miles south of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings her one advantage: He enables her to raise money,''
said Jack Pitney, a political science professor at southern
California's Claremont McKenna College. ``With Bob Dornan, Loretta
Sanchez is a Democratic star. Without Bob Dornan, she is just a
B-minus member of Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Dornan himself put it, ``She's nationally known because
she feeds off my fame, or infamy, depending on your point of
view.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the district is not so staunchly Democratic, or so
overwhelmingly Hispanic, that the Sanchez campaign can afford to
sit still. A Chapman University poll this month did show Sanchez
leading Dornan by 12 to 15 percentage points. But that was down
from 21 percent in July, with 35 percent of registered voters
undecided. And Dornan, who won his seat six times, does have a
strong and ardent base of support.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the election ``no sure thing,'' Gary Jacobson, a
political scientist at the University of California at San Diego,
noted that Sanchez won by just 900 votes the last time around. This
time, with hotly contested races for governor and the US Senate,
California turnout is expected to be higher, although Democrats
expressed fear that disillusionment with Clinton could dampen voter
enthusiasm. Voter trends are in Dornan's favor, according to the
Chapman poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a mystery to anybody,'' Jacobson said. ``He has good
name recognition and he's an aggressive campaigner. ... He's a
fervent Roman Catholic and antiabortion, so it makes sense for him
to try to use that to build ties with an ex-constituency like
Latinos that wouldn't otherwise be on his side.''
</P>
<P>
   Although a conservative, Republican undertone remains, the 46th
Congressional District is not the way it was in 1984, when Dornan
was first elected. Along with Hispanics, it is increasingly
populated by Vietnamese immigrants. As a percentage of the
population, Santa Ana, the largest city in the district, has more
Hispanic residents than any other US city except El Paso. Now,
years after arriving in California, they are winning citizenship
and becoming eligible to vote. As Pitney noted, the relative
newcomers tend to vote Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always talk about how the Latino vote is something to
be campaigned for,'' said William Christiansen, executive director
of the Republican Party of Orange County, a group whose chairman is
Mexican-American. ``But it's very much part of our campaign. It's
not a crossover. It's something we take very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Dornan, during his congressional career, developed a reputation
as a relentless campaigner, both on and off the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   He prides himself on his nickname, ``B-1 Bob,'' for the work he
did to save the B-1 bomber program. As he works the district in the
final days of the campaign, he even accepted some responsibility
for his narrow loss, saying he had underestimated Sanchez's
campaigning skills. He derides her refusal to debate him now.
</P>
<P>
   But her campaign spokesman noted that Sanchez has returned to
the district every weekend Congress is in session, nearly 90 times
in two years, far more than the globetrotting Dornan did. Her
constituents, Hispanic and otherwise, can speak to her in person,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm saying to them: What has she done for you but give you a
little pride,'' Dornan said of his campaign strategy among
Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Said Godown, ``He's not a totally dumb guy; he realizes that, in
a district that is changing as much demographically as this one, he
needs to appeal to a broader range of voters. But after almost two
years spent bashing Latinos, if he thinks all of that just goes
away, I think he's delusional.''

SOFT MONEY HITS HARD, AND LATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HENDERSON, Ky. _ For years, the Republican Party fought to pass
the North American Free Trade Agreement. But in Kentucky,
Republicans are spending thousands of dollars in unregulated soft
money to pay for ads attacking Democratic Senate candidate Scott
Baesler for supporting NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Muchas gracias, Senor Baesler,'' a satirical-sounding actor
says, supposedly thanking Baesler for sending Kentucky jobs to
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The ad, much debated in one of the nation's closest Senate
races, illustrates the role being played by a last-minute infusion
of millions of dollars in soft money in campaigns across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the national political parties are not supposed to use
these unregulated and unlimited contributions to boost a specific
candidate. But in reality, both parties are spending millions of
soft dollars to sway voters in numerous Senate and House races.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have also dumped soft money into the Kentucky race.
But federal records released yesterday show that across the country
the Republican national committees have a dramatic advantage as
Election Day nears. Not only have the GOP committees raised 73
percent more than their Democratic counterparts in this election
cycle, but Republicans also had twice as much cash on hand for the
crucial advertising push during the final three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Republican advantage comes from soft money, the
rec-ords show. But both parties are raising more soft money than
has ever been collected in a midterm election, with the GOP up 144
pecent over 1994 and Democrats up 84 percent, federal records show.
Much of that money is immediately pumped into television
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is completly spinning out of control, and for what? A
handful of races where the election is in doubt,'' said Larry
Makinson, director of the nonpartisan Center for Responsive
Politics.
</P>
<P>
   The impact is clear in Kentucky, where many Senate campaign
commercials are paid for by the national parties.
</P>
<P>
   The race between Baesler, a former University of Kentucky
basketball star, and Republican Representative Jim Bunning, a
former major league baseball player, is supposed to be financed by
strictly limited contributions. Individuals can give no more than
$1,000 per campaign cycle to a candidate, and corporate
contributions are prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   But many commercials are paid for with unlimited contributions
and corporate money, the so-called soft money.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, the parties can accept ``nonfederal funds,''
or soft money, to pay for party-building activities. These
contributions have exceeded $500,000 from one individual in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton won reelection in 1996 partly by using soft
money to pay for ads that promoted his candidacy. Both the GOP and
the Democratic Party decided to use soft money this year to pay for
issue ads. Officials in both parties say that while the ads may
attack a specific candidate on a certain issue, the commercials are
legal because they don't specifically tell viewers to vote for
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The ad attacking Baesler for his support of NAFTA includes a
tagline that says it is paid for by the Republican Party of
Kentucky. While that is technically correct, the state GOP paid for
the commercial mostly with soft money that was transferred from the
national Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Simmons, a spokesman for the Bunning campaign, said Bunning
had no idea the state party was running the ad until it was aired.
Bunning does not disagree with the ad's premise, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have poured soft money into the race, too. The
Democratic Party has helped pay for ads that accuse Bunning of
raiding the Social Security fund, which Bunning called a lie.
Another Democratic Party ad accused Bunning of supporting
``loopholes for billionaires.''
</P>
<P>
   But the problem for Democrats is that they are running out of
money and will be vastly outspent in the final days. The Federal
Election Commission records released yesterday show that the
Republican Party _ the national GOP, plus the House and Senate
committees _ raised $185 million between Jan. 1, 1997, and Oct. 14,
1998. Democrats raised $107 million during the same period. For
both parties, soft money played a major role, with Republicans
collecting $94 million and Democrats getting $89 million.
</P>
<P>
   This disparity in funding has led to complaints from some
Democrats that the party may be holding back funds to help
candidates in order to pay off the $5 million debt remaining from
the Clinton-Gore 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, head of the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee, expressed frustration in an
interview earlier this year. The Democratic National Committee is
too focused on serving the White House instead of helping Senate
candidates, Kerrey argued.
</P>
<P>
   The DNC, he said, ``is a wholly owned subsidiary of the White
House.''

THE DISASTROUS WYE ACCORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yasser Arafat signed his first peace agreement with Israel (the
Oslo accord) in September 1993. He signed a second peace agreement
(the Gaza-Jericho accord) in May 1994. He signed a third peace
agreement (Oslo II) in September 1995. He signed a fourth peace
agreement (the Hebron accord) in January 1997. And last week he
signed the document negotiated at the Wye Plantation, his fifth
peace agreement with Israel in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has reaped a rich bounty from this peace process. He
rules his own quasi-state, the Palestinian Authority. Nearly all of
Gaza is his, and every major town on the West Bank _ and more land
is to come. He enjoys international deference and prestige. He has
a well-armed police force and millions of dollars. He controls
Palestinian newspapers, radio, and TV. He is immune from
prosecution for his many crimes, which include the murder of
children. He has been awarded the Nobel Prize.
</P>
<P>
   All through the years of peacemaking with Israel, Arafat has
repeatedly made clear just how far his vision of coexistence
extends. He made it clear again on Oct. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the negotiations were underway in Maryland, Palestinian
Authority police were arresting six Arabs from the village of
Waladja, near Bethlehem on the West Bank. They were seized for
engaging in behavior that is forbidden in Arafat's kingdom _ they
had paid a condolence call on the family of Itamar Doron, a
25-year-old Israeli Jew murdered a few days earlier while bathing
in the stream at Moshav Ora. Other residents of Waladja protested.
The six, they said, had no right to visit the grieving family ``in
the name of all the village.'' Arafat's Fatah organization
announced that while murder should be condemned, there must be no
condolence calls by Palestinians to Israeli homes.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the nature of peace in Arafatland.
</P>
<P>
   The road from Oslo has led to calamity. What Israel offered was
land for peace. The exchange it got instead was land for terror:
More Israelis have been blown up and gunned down by Palestinian
terrorists in the five years of ``peace'' than in the previous 15
years.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has exchanged land for threats: Farouk Kaddoumi, head of
the PLO's political bureau, vowed on Oct. 14 that the Palestinians
will follow up their declaration of a state next May by launching
``the battle against Israeli forces'' to eradicate ``the Israeli
presence on Palestinian lands.'' Kaddoumi is seen by many as
Arafat's most likely successor.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has exchanged land for anti-Semitism: The largest
newspaper in the Palestinian Authority, Al-Hayat Al-Jadida, writes
that Hitler's persecution ``was a malicious fabrication by the
Jews.'' That ``Jewish control over the mass media has ... put a
pleasant face on the vile image of Jews.'' That ``Jews spread
prostitution as a means of plunging the world into decadence,
abomination, and corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel has exchanged land for incitement: Fiery sermons in
Palestinian mosques preach jihad against the Zionists. Schoolbooks
exhort children to ``gather for war with red blood and blazing
fire'' and assign essays on the question, ``Why must we fight the
Jews and drive them out of our land?''
</P>
<P>
   Land for peace? Israel surrendered land and was paid back in
hatred. The Center for Palestine Research reports this month that
51 percent of the Palestinian public supports acts of violence
against Israel. If those are the sentiments of Israel's peace
partners, how must its enemies feel?
</P>
<P>
   The accord that Benjamin Netanyahu brought back from Wye is
worse than the deals negotiated by Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres.
Not just because Arafat will again be paid in land for promises he
has broken over and over. Not just because the language is so full
of fuzz and loopholes that it makes a farce of the ``reciprocity''
Netanyahu insisted would be his irreducible minimum.
</P>
<P>
   What is most alarming about this latest agreement is that there
is no Likud Party to oppose it. Netanyahu and his foreign minister,
Ariel Sharon, have acquiesced in an accord that would have had them
screaming had it been signed by their predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Peres was deposed as prime minister because most Israelis didn't
trust him to keep them safe. Now Netanyahu has agreed to terms that
even Peres never swallowed _ for example, letting the Clinton
administration, not the Israeli government, be the sole judge of
Palestinian compliance. The administration that couldn't stand up
to Saddam Hussein, that had no idea India was about to go nuclear,
that was stunned when North Korea launched a missile over Japan,
and that has lurched from empty threat to empty threat in Kosovo is
now going to crack down on Arafat's violations?
</P>
<P>
   The language of the Wye Memorandum is plain. It does not say,
contrary to media reports, that the Palestinian charter calling for
Israel's destruction is to be annulled. It does not say that
Arafat's police force is to be reduced. It does not say that
terrorist murderers will be extradited to Israel or imprisoned by
the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   The only sure consequence of Wye is that Israel will yield more
land and Arafat will demand still more. Eventually Israel will
refuse to give, but by then the State of Palestine _ with its Arab
allies _ will be ready to take. For the fifth time in five years, a
peace agreement has been signed that brings war closer. There is a
reason Arafat wore battle fatigues to the signing ceremony.

THE POWER, AND THE HARM, OF GOING NEGATIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roughly two-thirds of the money raised in political campaigns is
spent on advertising. Roughly half of those ad dollars get
dedicated to negative messages. Do the math and you quickly
understand why so many people are so disgusted with this year's
mid-term elections.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal reports more than $1.6 billion will be
raised and spent in this election cycle. That means about $1
billion will go to media advertising _ television, radio, print,
direct mail, telephone solicitation, and Internet. Roughly half of
that, $500 million, will be negative in tone and substance. That's
a number greater than the entire advertising budget of AT&AMP;T in 1997
($475 million) and equal to the combined advertising budgets last
year of Budweiser ($207 million), IBM ($202.5 million) and Toyota's
best-selling Camry nameplate ($90 million).
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that every Budweiser advertisement that ran in 1998
denigrated beer. Imagine that every IBM advertisement this year
said computers were useless and a waste of money. Then add another
$90 million of poorly produced, badly written attack ads
excoriating mid-sized sedans as lemons and you have some idea of
how destructive political advertising has become.
</P>
<P>
   The wear and tear on the political process is now pronounced.
Pollsters in both parties say they have never seen the electorate
so disengaged. One GOP polling firm predicts that two-thirds of the
nation's voting age population will not vote next Tuesday, a record
low. According to the most recent Gallup survey for CNN and USA
Today, roughly half (47 percent) of voters are less enthusiastic
about voting this year than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Focus group research conducted by the GOP across the country
finds that individual voters can't decide for whom they have the
most disdain. Some say Clinton. Some say Congress. Some say the
media. ``People just find the whole thing revolting,'' said a
Republican strategist.
</P>
<P>
   Bad as the advertising is, the public campaigning may be even
worse. Monday night's debate between Paul Cellucci and Scott
Harshbarger was emblematic of the diminution of civilized political
discourse. The D'Amato-Schumer Senate race in New York has become
an almost mindless exercise in character assassination. The
Glendening-Sauerbrey governor's race in Maryland has degenerated
into a World Wrestling Federation Texas Death match; no gouge is
off-limits. And these are the three ``hot'' races in the Northeast
corridor.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the Republican Party launched a $10 million advertising
campaign that addresses President Clinton's scandalous misconduct
with Monica Lewinsky. Since the story first broke in January,
Republican leaders have danced around the Lewinsky issue, fearing
it might provoke a backlash among independent women voters. Now,
GOP polling says those women probably won't vote.
</P>
<P>
   Who can blame them? Absent from this year's mid-term elections
is any positive agenda. In the 1994 mid-term, Republicans ran on
something called the ``Contract with America.'' Few voters knew the
details, but they were aware of its rough outline (less government,
lower taxes, deregulation). Democrats had no coherent platform
(other than self-preservation), and they were slaughtered at the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   This year's campaigns are all about what political marketers
call ``packaged goods'' issues. Congressional Democrats tout
abortion rights, education, Medicare for mom, and gun control to
appeal to women; Social Security protection to attract seniors, and
a variety of social welfare issues to hold core constituencies.
Congressional Republicans are only slightly less derivative,
promising tax relief (which they did not deliver in this year's
budget), less government (ditto), and deregulation (ditto again).
</P>
<P>
   Focus groups discuss these issues in terms of how effective they
might be in attracting voter support. No one involved thinks
they're engaged in anything other than a marketing exercise. They
could just as easily be talking about packaging deodorant.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, voter demographics will dictate Tuesday's results.
Who votes will decide who wins. And it is no accident that the
chief demographer of the Republican Party, John Morgan, has become
a minor media celebrity this fall. His expertise makes him one of
the few talking heads worth listening to in 1998. But the fact that
Morgan is now the nation's ranking pundit speaks volumes about what
our politics have become.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Morgan predicts the GOP will make major gains on
Tuesday, largely because Republican demographic cohorts are
growing. What he doesn't predict is that these gains will have any
real impact on public policy.
</P>
<P>
   Since there is no real GOP agenda to advance, the fact that
there will be more Republicans means only that there will be more
Republicans. Voters will look at the new lineup exactly the same
way they look at the current lineup; with deep distrust and little
hope. If something doesn't change, we will soon reach a point when
the only thing voters believe is negative advertising.

THE MOCKINGBIRD FINDS ITS KEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL STOCKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The mockingbird is singing again. Birds mostly sing in the
spring to establish nesting territories, but mockingbirds sing in
the fall, too. The territory this one is claiming is the Japanese
holly that grows outside my kitchen window. In terms of
entertainment value, it's the best shrub I've ever planted.
</P>
<P>
   As the mockingbird gorges on black holly berries, it chases away
any other bird that shows an interest. Gray with white stripes on
its tail, it is loaded with attitude, flashing its spotted wings
like a fan dancer. And it samples snatches of other birds' songs
with a versatility any cover band would envy.
</P>
<P>
   Many gardeners have caught on to the idea of using plantings to
attract birds. While hungry mammals such as deer, voles, raccoons,
rabbits, and woodchucks are bad news in gardens, birds are a good
deal. Some filch blueberries and raspberries, but they add song and
choreography as they swoop around the yard. They also eat insect
pests.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably in the colder months that I most enjoy having a
window on this form of wildlife. Back-yard bird feeders keep seed
eaters such as finches, chickadees, titmice, and cardinals around
for cheer on dreary days. Suet draws woodpeckers and nuthatches.
All birds flock to fresh water in a birdbath.
</P>
<P>
   But well-chosen berry bushes provide needed food for fruit
eaters that are not drawn to feeders stocked with seeds. These
include the robins that spend the winter in increasing numbers,
cedar wax-wings and, increasingly, Eastern bluebirds.
</P>
<P>
   Gardeners with berry-laden bushes in warmer areas such as
Plymouth County and Cape Cod also find themselves hosting catbirds
and hermit thrushes.
</P>
<P>
   And berries have their own rounded shiny beauty. Like
evergreens, they make our longest season seem less barren.
Deciduous leaves and flowers are gone, seeds seem dry and
desiccated, rustling ornamental grasses are ghostly, but berries
punctuate the spare black and white compositions of the winter with
little points of color and lushness. They are the jewelry of the
winter garden.
</P>
<P>
   Orange and yellow berries are cheerful in the fall, but red is
the best berry color for winter. It suggests holidays and warmth,
and it shows up on gray days and sparkles against a snowy backdrop.
Red and winter just seem to go together.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Holly's many attractions
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The holly family produces the prettiest red winter berries, and
attracts almost 30 kinds of birds, including bluebirds and
ring-necked pheasants. There are few more cheerful winter sights
than a red cardinal in a holly bush.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, there really weren't any evergreen hollies with red
berries that did well in cold New England winters. This was a
source of great frustration to Boston gardeners, who would take
clones of the opaca hollies native to the rapidly diminishing wild
upland areas of Cape Cod and try to nurse them through a Boston
winter with Wilt-Pruf antidesiccant spray and burlap wraps.
</P>
<P>
   We're lucky today that there's a new race of hybrid hollies that
shrug off cold through Zone 5, which covers most of New England,
and are resistant to leaf miners and other pests as well. I can't
say enough good things about these Meserve hollies, named after the
Long Island amateur gardener who bred them in her yard a generation
ago. They're also called ``blue hollies'' because their shiny,
toothed, evergreen foliage has a deep blue-green cast. Today there
are many selections that grow to various shapes and sizes like Blue
Princess, which has tons of red berries; Blue Maid, which is the
most cold-hardy and grows to 8 feet in 10 years; and Blue Boy, a
good pollinator for Blue Maid.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Maids must have a Blue Boy because hollies have genders.
Only the females bear fruit, but they need a male to do so. You
only need to plant one male holly but it must bloom at the same
time as its harem, so pick a Blue Prince for your Blue Princesses,
or perhaps a Blue Stallion, an excellent pollinator because its
long bloom period overlaps with that of many different females.
Obviously breeders had fun thinking up these names.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Winterberry is hot
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Probably the horticulturally hottest winter berries now are
those found on the many newly developed varieties of a native
deciduous holly known, appropriately, as winterberry, or Ilex
verticillata. This bone-hardy native of our swamps was long
overlooked by gardeners despite its glowing red berries because
it's not evergreen.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody must have forgiven this failing, however, because
hybridizers are now turning out popular improved garden varieties
that have larger berries and more of them. Some hybrids are crosses
with the Japanese winterberry, Ilex serrata, such as the new
Scarlett O'Hara. (Its male pollinator is, of course, Rhett Butler.)
Winter Red and Harvest Red are two other good ones.
</P>
<P>
   Two evergreen hollies that haven't caught on yet are our native
inkberry and its less-hardy Asian cousin, the Japanese holly. The
reason is obvious. Their berries are black instead of red. But I
can attest that the birds love them no less for that.
</P>
<P>
   Birds like evergreens for shelter in the winter, and experts
recommend that about 12 percent of your yard be planted with them.
Other evergreens that offer edible berries for birds include yews,
junipers, and red cedars.
</P>
<P>
   Though we enjoy the sight and, in some cases, the taste of
berries, they evolved specifically to attract birds, as Donald and
Lillian Stokes explain in their new, user-friendly ``Bird Gardening
Book: The Complete Guide to Creating a Bird-Friendly Habitat in
Your Backyard.'' The fruit provides food for the birds, while the
seeds inside pass through them intact and emerge encased in the
fertilizer of the droppings, usually far from the parent plant.
Thus, berries are seed-dispersal mechanisms for the shrub, thanks
to the birds.
</P>
<P>
   One reason why you find so many weeds such as poison ivy growing
under trees is that the birds perch there while ``dispersing''
their seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Wild trees and bushes are more dependent on birds for
reproduction than are garden plants and often offer more berries.
In fact, many long-domesticated garden plants, such as hydrangeas
and forsythias, have little value to wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Encouraging native plants
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Simon Perkins, a Massachusetts Audubon Society field
ornithologist, says, ``We generally encourage people to let
portions of their yard revert to a more wild state and let plants
such as catbriar, pokeweed, raspberries, and blackberries appear
because those are very popular food plants for birds.''
</P>
<P>
   Other native plants with good fall and winter berries for birds
include all the dogwoods, choke cherry (the selection
Brilliantissima has red berries), sumacs, wild cherries, Virginia
creeper, spicebush, cranberry viburnum, northern arrowwood,
nannyberry, and bayberry.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to accidentally make your yard less desirable to birds
by taking out mature wild plants that yield more food than anything
you're likely to replace them with. I'm glad now that I didn't cut
down the wild hackberry tree in my yard that's loaded with berries
and in its place plant a sterile hydrangea bush as I once
considered doing.
</P>
<P>
   And I regret having cut down an ungainly wild box elder tree. I
only learned that this is the main winter food for evening
grosbeaks after I noticed that these colorful yellow birds had
stopped visiting us.
</P>
<P>
   The Stokeses' 4-acre yard in Carlisle is a paragon of wildlife
habitat management _ and is also extremely attractive. ``You don't
need to sacrifice beauty to have birds,'' said Donald Stokes. The
central area contains carefully groomed beds of flowers that birds
like, while the edges contain unmowed areas of wild bushes, many of
them planted by the birds. The formula obviously works. The
Stokeses have attracted more than 140 species of birds to their
yard, more than 35 of which stayed to nest.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Taking stock in you your yard
</P>
<P>
   Donald Stokes advises homeowners to take stock of their yards
before buying berry plants. ``You probably already own some good
ones that are being shaded out by trees or are growing in the wrong
place. By moving them or pruning back the trees shading them, you
can double their crop of berries and be way ahead of planting a new
shrub. Berries require sun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A cheap way to start a hedgerow on your property is to string
a wire in the air for the birds to perch on. They will self-select
what they want,'' said Lillian Stokes. What they want is usually
more of what they ate that morning, the seeds of which are then
deposited in their droppings beneath the wire.
</P>
<P>
   However, some berry plants that birds love are bad for the
environment and should not be planted or allowed to sprout, said
Perkins. ``Generally speaking, Mass. Audubon discourages the use of
non-native plants in landscaping your yard. Many such as Oriental
bittersweet are invasive.''
</P>
<P>
   Other offenders include Japanese honeysuckle, common privet,
Japanese barberry, tartarian honeysuckle, winged euonymus, and
multiflora rose. Spread by birds, these plants are so aggressive
that they can take over wild areas, eventually reducing the
diversity of wildlife living there. In fact, bioinvasion, as the
introduction of exotic species is called, is second only to human
disruption in destroying natural habitats, according to the
Stokeses.
</P>
<P>
   However, many non-native fruiting plants that are not invasive
do make good garden choices. Mountain ash, which is native to
Western Massachusetts, is one of the best trees for brightly
colored winter berries. The rugosa rose is an exotic that has
proved well-behaved.
</P>
<P>
   Crab apples also originated abroad but have been in this country
for a long time with only positive effects. Select the varieties
with small fruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to Weston Nurseries in Hopkinton on a fall day and we
just looked at which types of crab apples the birds were eating,''
recalled Donald Stokes. ``And those were the ones we bought.''

ALL THE LEAVES ARE (NEARLY) BROWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE HATCH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   High in the oak canopies, there's a whole lot of shaking going
on as dead, brown leaves are whipped by autumnal winds. A month
ago, those leaves were green, and inside them a whole lot of
shaking was going on as photons and electrons did their
photosynthetic dance of life.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the life processes, photosynthesis is among the most
amazing, combining quantum physics, chemistry and biology. Through
photosynthesis, plants take some common inorganic materials _
carbon dioxide, water, and a smattering of minerals _ and produce
carbohydrates of varying complexities. And with these substances,
plants grow, reproduce, lie dormant, pretty much do everything.
</P>
<P>
   Photosynthesis. Onions do it, roses do it, moss and mighty oaks
do it. It has produced, as a byproduct, all or nearly all of the
oxygen on the planet, and each year it produces 200 billion tons of
sugars, ``fixing'' 50 billion tons of carbon into organic
compounds.
</P>
<P>
   Photosynthesis takes place inside subcellular structures called
chloroplasts, which are self-contained organelles in the cytoplasm,
the main ``soup'' of a cell. Typical leaf cells contain about 50
chloroplasts. They also contain mitochondria, which are organelles
involved in respiration. Plants turn energy (and water and carbon
dioxide) into food through chloroplasts, reconvert it through
mitochondria. Mitochondria are structurally similar to primitive
bacteria, and both organelles may have evolved from bacteria. (And
while chloroplasts are plant organs, mitochondria are found in
animal cells as well, meaning that you and I have what are probably
bacterial descendants living in our cells.)
</P>
<P>
   The ancestor of the chloroplast may have been a cyanobacterium,
capable of photosynthesis, that achieved a symbiotic relationship
with and inside a nonphotosynthetic cell. The bacterium would have
provided some carbohydrates, the host some other compounds needed
by the bacterium. Over time, the bacterium lost its independence,
and chloroplasts cannot survive on their own. But they have their
own DNA, and they develop from proplastids, which can replicate by
division.
</P>
<P>
   Chlorophyll is the key to photosynthesis. It is a complex
molecule with a magnesium atom in the center (substitute that
magnesium with an iron atom, and you have hemoglobin). In plants,
chlorophyll is found only in chloroplasts. There are several kinds
of chlorophyll, which are green pigments. Other pigments in
chloroplasts are the carotenoids, which are yellow and orange. In
addition to providing fall leaf color for you and me (once the
masking green of chlorophyll disappears in autumn), carotenoids
perform an antioxidant function in the chloroplasts, preventing
damage by absorbing free radicals produced from blasts of sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   And with the sun, we come to the heart of the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The sun radiates energy in the form of light. Energy and matter
are interchangeable, thank you very much professor Einstein, and
quantum theory tells us that real tiny radiating things like
photons behave oddly, as both particles and waves. A wave/particle
oscillates and is electromagnetic, and when it whacks into
something, it may have an effect. We all know what X-rays and
microwaves can do.
</P>
<P>
   When light hits a chloroplast, the electromagnetic effect is to
``excite'' chlorophyll and carotenoids, activating electrons to
higher orbit, faster speed. Chlorophyll absorbs red and blue light,
and carotenoids absorb blue and green. The pigments are in sacs
stacked in piles called grana, and these ar arranged just so _
just so that one vibrating, photon-excited molecule can get the one
next to it shaking and so on and so on (it's called resonance
transfer) until the excitation reaches certain centers called
``traps'' containing chlorophyll A.
</P>
<P>
   Chlorophyll A really flies off the handle in these vibrating
traps. The excited electron whizzes off, leaving a positively
charged ion. This sets up a chain reaction and is where physics
turns to chemistry, for in seeking to return to electromagnetic
balance, these charged particles change the molecules with which
they come in contact. It is a two-part series of reactions, not a
straightforward conversion of water and carbon dioxide into oxygen
and a sugar, either.
</P>
<P>
   In the first part, called the light reaction, the electrons go
bouncing along, splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen and
triggering the formation of complex molecules called adenosine
triphosphate, known as ATP, and the niacin-containing compound
NADPH. In the next phase, the dark reaction, ATP and NADPH form
sugars by reacting with carbon dioxide. (The carbon dioxide enters
via stomata, and during drought these openings close to prevent
moisture loss, so a plant can die the year following drought
because, without carbon dioxide, it will not have
photosynthetically made the food it would need to survive.)
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, that's photosynthesis in a nutshell, and I am mesmerized
by the thought of the sun, 93 million miles away, sending photons
into tiny plant structures, liberating electrons and loosing chain
reactions upon which we all depend for life, not to mention beauty
in the garden. Dominoes set up by evolution billions of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It is something to think about when viewing evergreens against
the snow this winter and the fresh green flush of spring.

FRIGHT NIGHT IS A BIG NIGHT FOR KIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first time 6-year-old Molly Coughlin puts her monster mask
on, it's just for a second; she's pretty sure this will be fun. By
the third time, she's less tentative. The transformation of a
delicate little girl into an ugly creature is complete: She's
hamming it up, clawing the air, and speaking in a gruff, monsterish
voice.
</P>
<P>
   Molly is a first-grader, one of 12 students at the Charlotte
Dunning Elementary School in Framingham, Mass., who have gathered
on the floor in the school library to talk to a reporter about
Halloween. For first and second-graders, candy is the best part.
Third, fourth, and fifth-graders have a hard time being so
definitive.
</P>
<P>
   The candy's great, they say, but it's also fun to make your own
costumes and it's awesome to go out at night with friends. They
like spooky decorations, but they don't like having someone jump
out at you from behind a tree when you aren't expecting it; Razi
Akhtar, a fourth-grader, says a bloody skeleton hanging from a tree
put a damper on Halloween for him for a season or two. None of them
like what fifth- grader Travis Hugh calls the bad things of
Halloween, like having tombstones stolen off your front lawn, or
waking up to find your trees full of toilet paper or your garage
covered with eggs.
</P>
<P>
   What's clear from this mixed-age discussion is that children of
all ages invest a lot of energy into Halloween, anticipating some
of it with pleasure and excitement but also steeling themselves for
coming face to face with their fears.
</P>
<P>
   Young children, of course, are most vulnerable. In two
sentences, Molly and first-grader Allyssa Jewell sum up what
parents need to know:
</P>
<P>
   ``People always look a little bit scary in masks,'' says Molly.
Adds Allyssa: ``When you see people in costumes, you think they are
real, even if you know they aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A belief in transformation
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This explains why a 3-year-old can insist in the store that he
wants the skeleton mask but refuse to wear it when the time comes,
or why a 4-year-old can't wait for trick-or-treaters to arrive,
then hides behind you when the first ghosts show up. ``They can
watch the costume going on, they can know the person inside it, but
the bottom line is that the typical child under 6 believes in
transformation,'' says early childhood educator Eleonora
Villegas-Reimers of Wheelock College.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, she says, ``Once the mask goes on, they believe
the person becomes the character.''
</P>
<P>
   That's true not only for someone else but for them, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they put on a costume, they assume the role that goes
with it,'' says child developmentalist Judith Wagner, a professor
at Whittier College in California. This is a powerful feeling for
them, a combination of role-playing and wish fulfillment. ``You get
to be someone who has more strength or more ability or more
something,'' says Wagner, who is director of the Broadoaks
Children's School, a lab school for 2- to 11-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   There's also excitement in stepping just to the edge of a fear
and not going over, and then next time stepping a little bit
closer. ``It's a kind of desensitization, a healthy way to master a
fear,'' says developmental psychologist Malcolm Watson of Brandeis
University.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Too much gore isn't good
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But there's a danger, too: Kids can get overly desensitized by
getting used to too much gore. ``Halloween has a function, but
you've got to exercise some control,'' he tells parents.
</P>
<P>
   Increased commercialization of Halloween makes that hard.
``There are gory images all over in the weeks before Halloween and
most of them are as inappropriate for young children as
pornography,'' says Watson. ``It's more than they can handle.'' His
own daughter, who is 2 1/2, is a recent victim, having been badly
frightened at the Natick Mall when they passed a store window
decorated with Halloween gore, including skulls oozing blood.
</P>
<P>
   Watson was as reassuring as he could be, telling her the skulls
weren't real, that they were for adults, not children, and that
they wouldn't go in the store. She wanted to go home, which they
did, but she talked about it for days, calling it the scary store
and saying she didn't want to go back.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Roberts, director of the Dandelion Preschool in Cambridge,
had a similiar experience with her grandchild, who was frightened
by a puppet on stilts at a fair. ``Once a child is frightened, you
need to help him feel empowered. That usually means removing him
from the scene or taking the scary object away. It doesn't mean
forcing him to confront it,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   If a 2-year-old is frightened by trick-or-treaters, retreat to a
part of the house where she won't see or hear them; if a 3-year-old
is frightened by masks, ask the owners to remove them.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you do, says Villegas-Reimers, ``don't get into an
argument about what's real and what's not. Accept that this is real
for her, and very scary.'' She offers this response for a
frightened child: ``This is scary, but we're protected today
because it's Halloween. Monsters can't hurt us today.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Older children
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By 6 and 7, children are less frightened by transformations but
still can get caught up in a role they assume, including being
frightened by it. For older children who are too embarrassed to put
on dress-up clothes anymore, a costume is a sanctioned way to
assume another role. ``It's a lot of fun not to have to be
yourself, to dress up and act weird,'' says 10-year-old Travis
Hugh.
</P>
<P>
   Because there's so much potential for young children to be
scared, some preschools are moving away from Halloween
celebrations. The Playcare Center in Lexington eliminated costumes
a few years ago after children were frightened by a photographer
dressed as a clown. At the Dandelion School, children have the
chance to paint grocery bags into body costumes; some do, some
don't. Wagner's lab school has perhaps the most innovative
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't do any adult-initiated holiday celebrations,'' she
says. In the day care, preschool, and lower grades, teachers put
out Halloween-colored paper for free-choice art projects, but
there's usually more interest after the holiday than before.
</P>
<P>
   Although this policy was adopted to show a model that isn't
dependent on holidays (she calculates they've gained 12 days of
curriculum time), Wagner says there have been two unexpected
benefits. One is to reduce anxiety among parents and children who
don't celebrate specific holidays or who do it differently; the
other is to strengthen family rituals. ``Kids aren't holiday'd out
by the time the holiday comes around,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
The personal touch
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For parents who want to bolster family time at Halloween, Wagner
advises staying away from store-bought items. That any costume or
decoration can be purchased may make life easier for busy adults,
but it eliminates the personal touch. ``Lasting memories don't come
from buying plastic pumpkins,'' says Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   While young children don't care how they get their costume,
older children do. By sixth or seventh grade, much of the appeal of
Halloween is its challenge to be creative.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're no longer working out fears or living fantasies by
assuming a role. What's interesting to the 12- or 13-year-old is
coming up with something no one else has,'' says Watson.
</P>
<P>
   They're also increasingly interested in socializing. Sometime in
the middle school years, he recommends Halloween parties rather
than trick-or-treating. ``Too much potential for mischief,'' says
Watson.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Hugh is already agitating about trick-or-treating without
his parents. ``It's so boring when they come,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   At the prospect of being parentless, Molly sits up with a start.
``First-graders like to go with their parents,'' she says.
``Especially,'' interjects Allyssa, ``if you saw a ghost movie or
something haunted before you go out in the dark.''

LEGENDARY TEST PILOT SKEPTICAL ABOUT GLENN MISSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SIG CHRISTENSON  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The legendary test pilot Chuck Yeager said John
Glenn's return to space was an expensive publicity stunt that aims
to boost interest in NASA.
</P>
<P>
   It also is an effort to ``rehabilitate'' Glenn's image and
reward the hero of the Mercury space program for backing the agency
during his years in the Senate and for supporting President
Clinton, Yeager said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration both took issue with Yeager's comments.
</P>
<P>
   Yeager, who became an American icon by breaking the sound
barrier 51 years ago, called Glenn's mission ``hype, and God only
knows NASA needs it real bad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a payoff to Glenn for his support of Clinton and also the
NASA budget,'' Yeager, a retired Air Force brigadier general who
lives in California, said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``And also, NASA needs the publicity, and they couldn't have
picked a better guy to hype the space program,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, 77, became the first American to orbit the Earth during
his debut space flight in 1962. On Thursday, he became the oldest
earthling to fly in space when the shuttle Discovery rocketed into
orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's role in the 144-orbit, 3.5-plus million-mile shuttle
mission as a geriatric guinea pig drew some 4,000 journalists to
Florida, far more than the 300 or so who typically cover shuttle
launches.
</P>
<P>
   NASA spokesman John Ira Petty said Glenn's presence ``played a
role'' in the media surge, which could be a record, topping even
the Apollo lunar missions.
</P>
<P>
   But he defended have the four-term Ohio senator as a member of
the crew, saying he would help shed light on disturbed sleep
patterns and other afflictions of the aged.
</P>
<P>
   Yeager called Glenn's part in the $422 million mission a ``waste
of money.''
</P>
<P>
   He compared it to previous shuttle missions on which now-retired
Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, and former Rep. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., flew
in the 1980s. Both men served on key committees that controlled
NASA's budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'll tell you,'' Yeager said. ``If Glenn wasn't a
senator, he wouldn't be going up in the shuttle.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Roger Salazar said Clinton had nothing to
do with the decision to place Glenn on the shuttle 36 years after
he rocketed into history by making a 4-hour, 55-minute flight
aboard the tiny Friendship 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NASA administrator makes the decisions about who flies
space shuttle missions and for anyone to suggest otherwise, I think
we have to take issue,'' Salazar said.
</P>
<P>
   Yeager, 76, who earned $1 a year as a civilian test pilot
consultant until retiring one year ago, said the Discovery flight
gives Glenn one more shot at glory.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn and other members of the crew were quarantined in Florida
before the launch. Neither he nor his office staff could be reached
for comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Though described as America's greatest test pilot because of his
role in breaking the sound barrier on Oct. 14, 1947, Yeager didn't
make the space program, which accepted only candidates with college
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Petty said NASA had not offered Yeager a shuttle flight. Yeager
denied resenting NASA for that, saying a trip to space ``would be
fun'' but useless.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was a politician, I'd say, `Man, that'd be great to go up
there and fly the space shuttle and walk away, you know, waving and
bowing to the crowd and all that crap,''' Yeager said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not that way. You know, it's just that I was taught to
be prudent, and in the military that's a way of life.''

SOY SUPPER IS FOOD FOR THOUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A group of us from the Marblehead Cancer Prevention Project went
into Boston in June to hear the author of ``Dr. Susan Love's Breast
Book'' speak. Love's book had been my bible while I was awaiting
the outcome of a biopsy years ago, and so I was eager to hear about
her experiences in treating women with breast cancer. Our group,
however, had its own agenda. We wanted to find out everything Love
knew about breast cancer prevention.
</P>
<P>
   She had three words to say on the subject. Soy. Soy. And more
soy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I know a lot of you think you don't like soy products,''
Love said, ``but if I asked, you'd say you don't like flour,
either. Yet you like cake and cookies. It's the same with soy. It's
capable of taking on many flavors and it can be delicious if you
cook it right.'' She went on to explain that cultures like Japan,
where soy is an integral part of the diet, have very low levels of
breast and prostate cancer, not to mention that the Japanese don't
even have a phrase for ``hot flashes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the car on the way home, we groaned. Tofu. Tempeh. Soy milk.
Soy nuts. Soy powder. Yuck. Love had suggested we eat 40 grams of
the stuff a day. The thought of having to ingest such a large dose
of soy every day made death look attractive by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   We had Love's suggestion. We just didn't like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't we have a potluck soy supper,'' suggested Kathleen.
We joked: soy appetizers, followed by soy salads, soy main courses,
soy desserts, soy milk for our coffee. ``I'm not kidding,''
Kathleen insisted. So recently we gathered our spouses and
significant others for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   This was the menu:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sandra's Cheese and Crackers &LR; . Sandra found a brand called Tofu
Rella, which comes in both cheddar and mozzarella. The mozzarella
was excellent and is supposed to melt well. I would have no problem
using the cheddar in cooking.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jane's Original Sweet Curry Dip &LR; . Blend 8 ounces light cream
cheese, 6 ounces soft tofu, 12 ounces apricot jam, and 3
tablespoons curry powder in a processor until smooth. Chill
overnight. Serve with chips, fresh vegetables, ham chunks, etc.
Delicious!
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jane's Original Smoked Bluefish Spread &LR; . Blend in a processor
three-quarters of a pound smoked bluefish, 8 ounces soft tofu,
juice of one lime, 3 tablespoons olive oil, fresh herbs such as
chives or parsley, and ground pepper. Spread on crackers.
Outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jane's Original Stuffed Mushrooms &LR; . Crunchy breadcrumb filling.
You'd never know these contained tofu. Excellent!
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Teresa's Apricot Picante Tofu &LR; . This was a sweet-and-spicy
dish, using firm tofu, served on rice. My personal favorite.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Teresa's Grilled Spiced Tofu Triangles &LR; . Because this dish
looked like tofu, it had one strike against it before it even hit
my taste buds. If you must grill something, I wouldn't choose tofu.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Christina's Peppers Stuffed with Corn and Tempeh &LR; . As good as
any stuffed peppers I've ever had. Tasted like hamburger. Great.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Kathleen's Soybean Casserole &LR; . Mexican flavor and a wonderful,
chewy consistency. If you like frijoles, you'll be crazy about
this.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Doug's Salad &LR; . Along with organic greens, there were soy nuts,
which added crunch, and ``sweet bean'' green soybeans, which are
now available in the freezer section of most supermarkets. With an
Italian dressing and sections of grapefruit, this was a winner. I
gave it a 10.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Robin's Banana Fig Tofu Pie &LR; . It wasn't quite sweet enough
until we added whipped cream. Wonderful texture. Surprisingly good.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Linda's Chocolate Tofu Pudding &LR; . Made from a mix in under five
minutes. Sweet, smooth, and satisfying. Would be great poured over
fresh berries, with a dash of whipped cream.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the evening, we were sated and amazed. This meal
confirmed my belief that wonderful things result when creative
people put their heads together. Soy isn't part of what we usually
consider an American cuisine, but once you move beyond your
preconceptions, it's a wonderful high-protein addition to one's
diet. I've been happily having a fruit frappe made with frozen
berries, banana, skim milk, and soy powder for lunch ever since.

SPOOKY TOILET FLUSHES BY ITSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My toilet sometimes flushes all by itself. How in the world
can that happen and what can I do about it?
</P>
<P>
   EDWARD SCHLAICH, Lexington, Mass. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We've heard of haunted houses, but haunted toilets? Come on!
Maybe you can get it to perform on Saturday night. But seriously,
it does happen, so it is probably not a poltergeist. Here's the
story: After a flush, the flapper or rubber ball in the tank does
not seat properly on the drain opening to the bowl. A slow leak
occurs, which, if it gets fast enough, can raise the flapper and
flush the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   One cure is to adjust that flapper or ball so that it sits
directly on the opening, creating a watertight seal. Some
flapper/ball units are easily adjusted, others are not and may
require a plumber, who may recommend installing new ``guts'' in the
tank.
</P>
<P>
   To determine that a leak is the cause, put a little vegetable
dye in the tank and check the bowl to see if that dyed water is
leaking into the bowl. If that is happening, then you go to Plan A
above. If it isn't happening ... call Ghostbusters.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a funny situation on my 29-year-old storm windows.
When I went to put them down for the winter, I discovered a bunch
of straw in the grooves on both sides of the window. The straw is
really quite tightly wedged into the grooves. What's going on?
</P>
<P>
   D.K., Westwood, Mass. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It's because the storms are loose in their grooves. The same
goes for the screen. In summer, the wind blows, picks up chaff such
as dried grass clippings, and blows it every which way, including
into the joints of the windows. The old windows also tend to bend
inward when the wind blows, making the joints even bigger for that
chaff to enter.
</P>
<P>
   There is no cost-effective cure, so live with it, and dig out
the chaff with a screwdriver as you adjust the storms and screens.
It is less likely for chaff to collect in winter.
</P>
<P>
   If cost is not a factor, buy new, tight storms. One of the best
in my opinion and experience is True Channel, made by Harvey
Industries. These storms are airtight with the grooves being
U-shaped rather than L-shaped, for extra tightnesss; and when the
window blows, the joints do not expand.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. A bag of cement got very hard after being stored for two
years. I broke it up a little and it worked to make concrete. Will
that cement be OK to make more concrete?
</P>
<P>
   PAUL ANDERSON, Melrose, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It can work if you can break up the cement (which got hard
because of moisture) and pulverize it back into powder. But it is
so inexpensive that it is probably worth buying new Portland cement
rather than risk the old cement not working.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, cement is Portland cement, and is only a part of
concrete, which comprises cement, sand, and gravel.

   If the bag was a concrete mix (with cement, sand, and gravel),
breaking it up completely may work, provided some of the mix has
not become concrete, which is virtualy impossible to break up and
reconstitute. But again, the cost of these bags is so low that it
is hardly worth the effort to break it up.

   A. The Fantastic and Formula 409 may not have worked because of
the way you used them. The way to work with such materials is to
apply liberally, let sit for an hour, even, then scrub and rinse.
Letting the solution sit a while will allow it to do its work of
dissolving the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Or, use Soft Scrub or Simple Green, the same way as described
above. The handyman has had good luck by leaving either of these
cleaners on the surface, even letting it dry out, then scrubbing
and rinsing. The secret is to leave the cleaner on as long as
practicable.

   MOMA-POLLOCK-EXHIBIT (New York) _ The Jackson Pollock show at
the Museum of Modern Art. The retrospective, a landmark, is nearly
perfect. Restraint is pointless. If you care about art you live for
exhibitions like this, in which an artist, against the heavy odds
of his own skewed talent and unhinged personality, pursued
something so wild, untested and mysterious that its full meaning
was unclear even to him, yet who briefly wrung from his peculiar
system of painting one variation after another. By Michael
Kimmelman.
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON-GRAVES (Boston) _ Time flies. Remember you must die.
Those words are carved in stone, a few steps from busy Tremont
Street. The phrases are actually in Latin (``Fugit hora, memento
mori''), but their meaning is vividly clear by what appears beneath
them, a carving of Father Time with an hourglass and a skeleton
with an arrow, both reaching to snuff out a candle. The scene turns
up a few times on the gravestones in King's Chapel Burying Ground,
Boston's oldest graveyard, which I recently visited on a tour of
historic graveyards in and around Boston. By Gustav Niebuhr.

   NY-ETHNIC-THEATER (New York) _ For a place as wildly diverse as
New York, the city's major commercial theater can often seem
considerably less so. Sure, ``The Beauty Queen of Leenane'' is an
Irish play, and ``Art'' is French. The list, and the world, seem
pretty much to end right there. But while Broadway's idea of exotic
fare may be a West End import, in neighborhoods throughout the
city, smaller nonprofit theaters are serving up a feast of original
work, seldom-seen plays and new translations from a wide variety of
ethnic backgrounds. By Jesse McKinley.

   KENNEDY-VIOLIN (New York) _ Probably the first thing to know
about the English violinist Nigel Kennedy is that having returned
to the classical concert stage after a five-year self-imposed
exile, during which he worked almost exclusively on rock projects,
he is no longer using his first name. ``I suppose it was partially
a contemptuous thing to do, to rile the British critics,'' Kennedy
said during a recent stopover in New York, before starting a tour
that includes a run of performances with the New York Philharmonic
and a recital at Avery Fisher Hall this weekend. By Allan Kozinn.

   WHITNEY-REORG (New York) _ It did not take long for Maxwell L.
Anderson, the new director of the Whitney Museum of American Art,
to start making his mark. After less than 60 days on the job,
Anderson has announced changes in the museum's curatorial and
management organizations that will add more rigor to programming
decisions, decentralize decision making and require hiring two

MARTHA STEWART'S   HALLOWEEN:   REALLY SCARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Tuesday's ``Martha Stewart Living'' Martha confessed that
she's one of those people who goes ``all out'' on Halloween. No
kidding. When doesn't she?
</P>
<P>
   Martha, true to form, was showing how she constructed a
jack-o'-lantern snake _ ``an interesting and terrifying
decoration'' _ to adorn her Halloween doorstep using nothing more
than 34 pumpkins in assorted sizes, a utility saw, an exacto knife,
a power drill with a borer attachment and three sets of sturdy
outdoor holiday lights. Oh, and a tool called a Pumpkin Eater, a
plastic scraper specifically designed for hollowing out pumpkins.
</P>
<P>
   It was the sort of simple project anyone might undertake if she
had nothing better to do than go out and buy 34 pumpkins, lug them
home, scrape out their insides and bore them full of holes. But why
34 pumpkins? Why not 35 or 36? Or 66? For that matter, why not 104?
It's just one of the many mysteries of Martha. Maybe it has
something to do with the expense of acquiring all those pumpkins,
although money seldom seems to be a consideration in Martha's
world, and why should it be? But she may figure that her viewers
would balk at buying more than 34. Those who have to buy them, that
is, those who haven't grown their own from last year's seeds, the
Martha Stewart way.
</P>
<P>
   I know some of you are thinking: There she goes again. Will she
never stop picking on Martha? Inevitably a reader or two will,
after reading this, write or call to accuse me of being insanely
jealous of Martha. If only it were that simple. I don't begrudge
Martha an iota of her success, because she's earned it. But 34
pumpkins? Is this, as Martha might say, a good thing?
</P>
<P>
   Lately, in the interest of my editor's sanity, I have resisted
the urge to write about Martha. I keep an eye on her though. It's
almost impossible not to. She's everywhere. There have been
occasions when I have been tempted to comment, for instance when
she advised her viewers how to arrange their outdoor woodpiles in
aesthetically appealing patterns. That was unbelievable. But it was
the pumpkins that drove me to this.
</P>
<P>
   There's something about pumpkins that seems to inspire Martha to
creative flights. In autumns past she's used them as soup bowls and
tureens, as cooking vessels, as vases, as doorstops, among other
things. This year, in the October issue of her magazine Martha
provides instructions for readers who wish to make preppy-looking
monogrammed pumpkins that might have rolled right out of a Talbot's
catalog, if Talbot's sold vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   But Martha's ultimate jack-o'-lantern challenge this year is
carving the Colonial Revival cameo pumpkins pictured on the cover
of the same issue. (``The mantel is the perfect place for two
glorious silhouette profiles fixed in a gaze.'') These are
18th-century-style profile silhouettes executed in squash, the kind
of thing anyone with an advanced degree in fine arts could knock
off in an evening or two.
</P>
<P>
   Attempting either the monograms or the cameos requires eight
tools, among them a linoleum cutter, a melon baller and a sabre
saw. Those of us who still attack the Halloween pumpkin with a
kitchen knife and our hands may well feel unworthy, unimaginative
and inadequate just reading the instructions for creating these
Martha-style jack-o'-lantern. Which may be the point.
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible Martha is putting us on with some of these
incredibly elaborate projects? Could the pumpkin snake, for
instance, be her idea of a joke? Is she sitting down there in
Westport, Conn. (``The Martha Stewart State'') at her fabulous
Turkey Hill estate chortling at the thought of her faithful
acolytes reaming out pumpkins by the dozen? I'd like to think so.
It's the only way I can bear it.

LINDA MCCARTNEY ANTHOLOGY IS UNEVEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Linda McCartney may have been a wonderful wife to former Beatle
Paul McCartney _ as he has stressed continually _ but her music
career was another matter. She was an adequate (at best)
keyboardist with his band Wings and his later solo groups, but a
rather inept vocalist. That's quite apparent on the new Linda
McCartney anthology, ``Wide Prairie'' (Parlophone), consisting of
many previously unreleased songs, that hits the stores today.
</P>
<P>
   Recorded during the last 26 years, right up to a month before
her death from breast cancer in April, the anthology is a vastly
erratic _ sometimes lighthearted, sometimes painful _ grab for
credibility. Most songs feature husband Paul as producer and
multi-instrumentalist, but even his pop legerdemain (on one song he
plays seven instruments, from Mellotron to banjo) can't save the
bulk of the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   On the light side are covers of the Coasters hit ``Poison Ivy''
and a reggae-ized ``Mr. Sandman,'' featuring a backing track from
Jamaican producer Lee ``Scratch'' Perry. On the heavy side _ the
side that most people will remember _ are several original songs
espousing animal rights, a profound cause to her as a longtime
vegeterian.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is ``Cow,'' about an animal being led to the
slaughterhouse. ``Placid creature ... you will go with quiet
dignity,'' Linda sings, as Paul adds a stinging guitar sustain.
Another is ``The White Coated Man,'' told from the point of view of
a puppy in a vivisection lab. Her flat vocal does it a disservice,
but the song is powerful.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the songs, however, fall into a superficial, hobbyist
mode. (Linda was clearly a better photographer _ her original trade
_ than singer.) The title track finds her affecting a nasal,
mock-cowboy twang that will make you reach for an aspirin. Another
knockoff is ``New Orleans,'' about ``oysters on the
half-shell/Bourbon Street's got its own spell.'' It's like a
tourist ditty.
</P>
<P>
   As one might imagine, there are a number of goofy songs, from
the inscrutable ``Oriental Nightfish'' to ``Cook of the House''
(``I'm the cook of the house/No matter what I serve the guests/They
seem to love the kitchen the best'') and ``B Side to Seaside,''
which sounds like a Jimmy Buffett outtake.
</P>
<P>
   The best song by far is ``Appaloosa,'' about Linda's love of
Appaloosa horses. (Paul even bought her one and had it shipped to
their farm in Scotland.) Above a driving rock rhythm, she sings
about soldiers ``stealing tribal land,'' but the horses leading the
tribesmen to safety. The limitations of her voice are overcome by
sheer passion, which didn't happen enough in the rest of her music.

PHISH'S JAM-BAND SPIRIT SHINES THROUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  It's strange to see Phish reaping so much media attention
these days. The band is winning radio play, a rarity for this
neo-hippie jam band. The group is in Time magazine, which wrote
that ``Vermont's best-kept secret edges up to fame.'' There were
recent appearances at Farm Aid and Neil Young's Bridge School
Benefit. There's the band-authorized ``Phish Book,'' about a year
in the life of the group. And there's an appearance tonight on
``The Late Show with David Letterman.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes, and there's a new album, ``The Story of the Ghost''
(Elektra).
</P>
<P>
   Phish has never been known as a studio band; it's better
understood as a word-of-mouth live act, selling more tickets than
albums, a la the Grateful Dead. That likely won't change with the
new disc, but at the very least, it's the most cohesive-sounding
studio album that Phish has made since it started recording in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   It's also the most faithful to the group's jam-band spirit,
which can be good and bad. There are brilliant moments (such as the
new airplay tune, ``Birds of a Feather,'' which mixes '70s funk
with a hesitation bass line and psychedelic, wah-wah guitar),
offset by some meandering moments that are distinguished by
hallucinogenic lyrics but also soporific jams. Yet the general
sound, which relies on simmering funk rhythms from bassist Mike
Gordon and drummer Jon Fishman, rather than the rock-guitar flash
of past efforts, is appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, this is a more laid-back album than one might expect
from Phish (which plays three sold-out dates at the Worcester
Centrum Centre Nov. 27-29). But let it be said that the highs
definitely outweigh the lows. By resolutely doing a jam album _ the
sessions started with four nights of jams at Bearsville Studios in
upstate New York, followed by jams at a rented farmhouse in Vermont
_ the band was throwing out any preconceived notions. Thus, this
album will probably be liked by more Phish fans than usual. It
still doesn't rival their live shows, but it's a challenging
effort.
</P>
<P>
   The ``ghost'' imagery is, well, bizarre. The song ``Ghost,''
which introduces the album and is co- &QC; 
written by guitarist Trey Anastasio, tells of a friendly ghost who
is no longer needed. ``He's waiting in the wind and rain/I simply
haven't looked,'' as the lyric by longtime Phish collaborator Tom
Marshall goes.
</P>
<P>
   Lyrical strangeness, of course, is a Phish trademark. If you
can't let your imagination go, then you can't get into Phish. Take
``Guyute,'' the only old tune here (the band has been doing it in
concert for a few years). It's a nearly nine-minute meditation on
an ``ugly pig who walked on me and danced a jig that he had learned
when he was six.'' Of more interest is how the song evolves from a
Celtic folk flavor reminiscent of Steeleye Span, to Grateful
Dead-like trebly guitar, to Primus-like funk, to celestial,
Emerson, Lake and Palmer-like organ bursts, courtesy of keyboardist
Page McConnell. The whole Phish package is on display.
</P>
<P>
   Phish's musical range continues to astonish. There are Beach
Boys-style harmonies in ``Brian and Robert'' (an ode to couch
potatoes: ``If you're just staring at your walls, then this one is
for you,'' the song says) and a Simon &AMP; Garfunkel flair in the
curiously titled ``Roggae.''
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of dreamy numbers as well. One standout is the
arcing, groove-laden ``Wading in the Velvet Sea,'' with this trippy
lyric: ``I took a moment from my life, wrapped it up in things you
say, and mailed it off to you.'' Phish-heads will digest these and
other witticisms for months.

JOURNALISM GRAPPLES WITH PHOTO ALTERATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JUKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may seem trivial. But the decision of ``Brill's Content''
magazine to tinker with its September cover mug shot of a young
Bill Gates reflects one of journalism's major quandaries. (To make
the photo fit, the magazine raised the arrest placardthat was hung
around Gates's neck after his 1977 arrest in New Mexico on an
undermined charge.)
</P>
<P>
   The issue of altering photographs is touchy enough to have
warranted an explanation from ``Brill's Content'' ombudsman Bill
Kovach. Given the growing ability to manipulate photos ``the
question becomes more insistent,'' Kovach wrote. ``What to believe
of what you see?''
</P>
<P>
   No less a journalistic pace setter than The New York Times has
recently displayed the wonders of what Kenny Irby, photojournalism
associate at the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, calls ``a new
form of imagery.'' And in the process, it also raised red flags.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 18, the Times colorized a part of an old Associated
Press photo of a pumpkin patch belonging to Cold War figure
Whittaker Chambers; on Oct. 19, it juxtaposed the Microsoft Windows
logo with a photo of the courthouse where the government is
battling the software giant; and on Oct. 20, it superimposed the
euro currency on the face of London's Big Ben. (The Boston Globe is
not immune. On Oct. 6, it published a ``photo illustration'' that
plopped Santa Claus down into the middle of the New York Stock
Exchange.)
</P>
<P>
   According to Times assistant managing editor Allan M. Siegal,
the paper's policy that ``basically we don't manipulate pictures''
has existed for years. Although he acknowledges the subjectivity of
the criterion, Siegal says that any altered photo ``ought to be
unmistakably fanciful.'' He contends the pumpkin photo fit that
definition, admits that ``I didn't think that the (courthouse
photo) was a good idea,'' and says the euro picture was not
particularly ``successful'' or ``witty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every now and then someone's idea of unmistakably differs from
mine,'' he says. ``There's a constant question on how to be
creative and ethical at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Many media observers worry that the new technology is
outstripping standards, that images are being modified without
serious consideration of the ethical issues. ``I believe it's
essential that newspapers protect the integrity of the visual
journalism in the same way they protect the integrity of the
words,'' says Bob Steele, director of Poynter's ethics program.
``It speaks to a number of questions in terms of authenticity of
the product and comes at a time when journalism is under fire on
many fronts.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Irby and the Society of Professional Journalists ethics
chair Steve Geimann say the losers are news consumers who are not
sure they can believe their eyes. ``The line between reality and
illustrations are going to become so blurry,'' says Geimann. ``We
may be getting close to the point, with the technology that exists
today, where the goal of getting clearer with the reader is getting
harder.'' Thus Geimann believes the Time's pumpkin photo should
have carried the caption, ``AP photograph colorized by The New York
Times.''
</P>
<P>
   Asserting that he's only aware of two newspapers _ the defunct
New York Newsday and The Columbus (Ohio) Dispatch _ that have
publicly explained their policy on photo manipulation, Irby says
newspapers have ``a responsibility to moderate a conversation with
readers, much like newspapers have done when the typography, when
the look of the newspaper has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Times's use of the imagery is responsible, Geimann
worries that ``future journalists ... (will) say `if I see it in
The New York Times, it must be OK.'''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Kalb is Beltway-bound &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One fact could have foretold Marvin Kalb's move back to the
Beltway after nearly 12 years as director of Harvard's Shorenstein
Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy: He is putting
central air conditioning in his Washington residence.
</P>
<P>
   Insisting his credo is ``never overstate your welcome,'' Kalb
will become executive director of the Shorenstein Center's
Washington Office in July. At this early stage, some names being
bandied about _ or at least dreamed about _ as his successor
include former White House press secretary Mike McCurry, Washington
Post political columnist David Broder, who will deliver the
Shorenstein Center's Theodore White Lecture on Press and Politics
Nov. 12, and presidential advisor/journalist David Gergen, who
begins teaching at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government this
spring. One near certainty is that Kalb's successor will be a
journalist rather than an academic.

ON PRIVACY   ISSUE, US SHOULD TAKE A CUT FROM EUROPEANS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Not content with denouncing Americans' concern with the
president's sex life, our European friends are now sniping at our
Internet privacy policies. While I generally sneer at advice from
across the pond, they're onto something this time.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every time you buy something on the Internet, or in the
real world, the seller files away a range of information about you
_ name, address, the items you bought, stuff like that. This info
can be used to figure out new goodies to sell to you. Firms also
make a profit by reselling customer data to other companies with
products to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Internet-based firms are especially eager to collect data about
shoppers. You think the free e-mail at many Web sites is really
free? You're paying for it by providing personal information that
may be used to sell you something.
</P>
<P>
   But Europeans with memories of Hitler, Stalin and Mussolini are
repulsed by the idea that every shoe store and supermarket might
have a dossier on its customers.
</P>
<P>
   So in 1995, the member nations of the European Community adopted
a set of rules that restrict the collection of personal information
by businesses. Those rules went into effect last weekend, and
they've thrown a scare into US firms doing business overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Under the European rules, firms not only need your permission to
sell your data to another firm, they must also tell you who's
getting the data, and exactly what information is being provided.
And firms must give you full access to all information they possess
about you, so you can make corrections if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   American companies would howl like wounded hounds if such rules
were imposed upon them. ``It's virtually impossible'' for big
companies to open up their customer databases for inspection, says
Bob Wientzen,  &UR;  &LR; president of the Direct Marketing Association in
New York. ``And even if it were possible, it would be very
costly.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, the marketers might want to dig out their checkbooks,
because the European rules hold foreign firms to the same
standards. If L.L Bean's Web site sells a plaid shirt to a Scottish
farmer, L.L. Bean would be expected to comply with European
data-privacy rules, under pain of being barred from doing business
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   It probably won't get this bad. Earlier this week, European and
American trade negotiators agreed to delay enforcement of the rules
against US firms, pending a compromise. The Europeans want the US
to adopt federal laws compelling at least certain basic
data-privacy rules, even if they don't completely meet European
standards. This country prefers a voluntary approach, with
companies joining organizations like TrustE &UR;  &LR; , a nonprofit group
that sets privacy standards for Internet firms.
</P>
<P>
   But even if a deal is reached in Washington, American firms
could still be on the hook. Peter Swire, a law professor at Ohio
State who specializes in data privacy, told me that the European
rules let any citizen sue a foreign company for perceived
violations of data privacy. So even if the Scottish government
doesn't sue L.L. Bean for its Web site policies, the customer
might.
</P>
<P>
   Something similar happened in 1995. American Airlines was
successfully sued by Swedish travel agents, after the airline
demanded to know if passengers were Jewish. The airline just wanted
to have kosher meals on hand, but Swedish law, rooted in bitter
experience, barred even asking the question.
</P>
<P>
   There'll be more such suits. The London-based watchdog group
Privacy International is keeping an eye on 24 major US firms, as
well as our FBI, for its data-gathering practices. They're hoping
to find violations of European rules, so they can sue and force
American firms to toughen up their data-privacy policies. Solveig
Singleton of the libertarian Cato Institute says companies should
have a near-absolute right to sell information collected from
customers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Earth to Cato: Get real. Buying a nine-volt battery at Radio
Shack doesn't entitle it to the story of my life. While the
European restrictions are excessively tough, they've got the right
general idea. And with half a trillion dollars in US-Europe trade
at stake, the Europeans may have enough leverage to make American
firms see things their way.

MICROPROCESSORS MEET MICROBIOLOGY   AT MIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON GARFINKLE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Tom Knight is working toward the day when a
computer can reproduce itself. That's right: a cross between a
microprocessor and microbiology.
</P>
<P>
   Knight's work is taking shape on the ninth floor of the
Artificial Intelligence Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. Instead of computer terminals, this office has flasks,
beakers, and test tubes. Instead of printers and modems, the lab
has a gene amplification device based on the polymerase chain
reaction. Instead of computer manuals, there are microbiology
journals.
</P>
<P>
   Here on the ninth floor, senior research scientist Tom Knight is
fusing the tools of computer science and biology to create a new
engineering discipline: microbial engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Computer scientists have a lot to learn from the way that mother
nature has constructed cells, says Knight. Take a memory chip out
of a typical desktop computer, and the computer is likely to crash.
Take a few cells out a human brain, and it's impossible to tell the
difference. That's because biological systems are much more
redundant, resilient, and flexible than manmade ones.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, adds Knight, biologists have a lot to learn
from the way that computer scientists build technology and control
complexity. ``Biologists are motivated to understand what naturally
occurs. They revel in the complexity. Engineers want to simplify to
the point that they can completely understand something,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Biology has another huge advantage over traditional computer
science. A typical computer chip factory costs a billion dollars
and every wafer has to be individually manufactured. A biologist,
however, can grow a trillion organisms overnight in a laboratory
for just a few dollars in material costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is different from other stuff,'' says Knight. ``It can do
its own manufacturing.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Knight, who has worked at MIT since he got his first
job there as a 10th grader in 1963, has spent much of the past five
years sitting in on MIT's doctorate-level biology classes. His goal
is to combine elements from both fields to help develop a new
generation of hybrid computer systems that are fast, flexible, and
yet incredibly cheap to manufacture.
</P>
<P>
   Knight's ultimate goal is to be able to program bacteria the way
that an engineer might program a microprocessor today. The
Microbial Engineering Lab's first project, starting up now, is to
genetically modify E. coli bacteria and add a few logic gates _ the
building blocks from which all digital computers are created. One
idea that Knight is toying with is to build a simple oscillator _ a
circuit that repeatedly turns on and off _ and to combine it with
the genes that create photoluminescence proteins. The result would
be a bacteria that flashes on and off at a regular interval.
</P>
<P>
   Another project that Knight's group is considering is a simple
flip-flop, the basic building-block of a computer memory chip, that
can be set or reset from outside the cell. Such a system could be
used for storing data or for controlling the expression of other
proteins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want a cell where we can say turn on this gene, turn off
that gene,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But Knight is the first person to admit that there are
fundamental gaps between what's possible in a test tube and what's
possible on a desktop PC.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll never run Microsoft Word on one of these bacteria,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is the clock speed. Most of today's computers operate
on a clock that switches on and off a hundred million times every
second; genes inside a bacteria cycle on and off roughly once every
10 minutes. Bacterial computers, as a result, will be very slow.
But because it will be possible to create trillions of them quickly
and cheaply, Knight says, they might be ideally suited to large
problems that can be broken up into many tiny pieces _ such as
breaking cryptographic codes or solving complex mathematical
equations.
</P>
<P>
   Another limitation on the ultimate complexity of a bacterial
computer is size. Every gene and messenger protein inside a cell
takes up a finite amount of space. Knight estimates that the
typical bacteria only has room for 200 or so additional signals or
logic gates. That means that computational microbes will probably
be limited to performing relatively simple functions _ things that
are done today with small microcontrollers.
</P>
<P>
   But a microbial microcontroller would have the advantage of
being able to reproduce and manufacture proteins, thanks to its
cellular machinery.
</P>
<P>
   ``A typical medical application would be cells programmed to
express antibiotic genes,'' says Knight. ``It would detect if a
pathogen was present, detect if the antibiotics are working, and if
so, express them.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Knight doesn't pull off his grand schemes, there are
likely to be big payoffs from this basic research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Engineers have a very different outlook on life than
biologists,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one thing that's complicated about biology today is
the basic mechanics of conducting experiments and recording
results. Despite the fact that laboratories are filled with
computers, most biologists record their results with a pen in
spiral-bound notebooks.
</P>
<P>
   To Knight, one of the architects of the information age, such
manual manipulations are pitifully primitive. So one of the side
projects that the Knight Lab is considering is the creation of a
self-documenting laboratory _ a smart room in which to conduct
experiments, where a computer can sense the readouts of every
laboratory instrument and record the results itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will really, really instrument the lab in a serious way,''
he says. ``We would like to move to a laboratory that automatically
documents for you what you are doing, with video capture on all of
the experiments, and even pipettes that you can read remotely.''
</P>
<P>
   If you think that Knight is just some crackpot computer hacker
who has gotten tired of stamping out code, think again. Working
with MIT professors Gerald Sussman and Harold Abelson, the
Amorphous and Cellular Computing project at MIT has received a
multiyear, multimillion-dollar grant from the UltraScale Computing
Project at the Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   That's the same organization that kickstarted the Internet and
much of the microelectronics revolution with funding back in the
1960s and early '70s. Perhaps in another 30 years, computers that
are based, in part, on biology will be as common as systems with
network connections today.

FEEDBACK ON POLAROID WAS INSTANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week we suggested that the management of Polaroid Corp.
might have served shareholders well by selling the company 10 years
ago when corporate raider Stanley Gold came calling. The math
seemed compelling to us: Gold offered $3 billion for the company
then; it is worth about $1 billion today.
</P>
<P>
   We got an instant reaction from the instant photography
company's supporters. In phone calls, e-mails, and letters, current
and former Polaroid employees said Gold would have put them on the
street and sacked the company. A few, however, thought Polaroid
could have used a good kick in the pants.
</P>
<P>
   Because so many people felt so strongly, we decided to give them
a say in Boston Capital. We'll start with a communique from  &UR; chief
executive Gary DiCamillo  &LR; to Polaroid employees.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By now many of you will have seen or heard about this morning's
Boston Globe article. I want to take a minute to say a couple of
things about it.
</P>
<P>
   First, Polaroid is midway through a turnaround that represents
an enormous amount to work by a lot of people all over this
company.
</P>
<P>
   Second, our new product strategy is the right one to grow the
business, and we are seeing early success.
</P>
<P>
   Third, we do have new challenges in today's global economy, but
we are responding appropriately and will be well-positioned for
1999.
</P>
<P>
   We need to focus on the future rather than the past. What
disappoints me about the story is that it dismisses not only the
hard-fought battle of 1988, but all the work of the past few years
that a lot of us have done to create a new future for Polaroid.
</P>
<P>
   I am proud to be associated with a company that has fought as
hard as we have and responds to every challenge we have been dealt.
We are on the right track. I look forward to better days ahead.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Your article on whether Polaroid should have sold to Stanley
Gold and the Disney crowd gets a resounding ``NO WAY'' from one
retired Polaroid employee.
</P>
<P>
   If Mr. Gold was successful in '89, I along with some 5,000 to
7,000 of my coworkers would have been summarily terminated. Mr.
Gold's plan was to raid the Polaroid pension plan by as much as
$300 million. He was also planning to ``shop'' Polaroid's camera
business to anyone interested in a license and to ``shop'' the film
business to Kodak and Fuji.
</P>
<P>
   The facts of Mr. Gold's strategy for the ``disposal'' of
Polaroid are irrefutable. The documents filed in the litigation
phase of the takeover struggle spell out in chilling detail the
ultimate outcome for Polaroid and its employees.
</P>
<P>
   The company is still struggling, but my view of the Stanley Gold
plan is the company would be extinct if Stanley had won the day
back in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PAUL HEGARTY,  &LR; Arlington, Mass. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last November I moved my company from Atlanta to Boston and
spent six months at Polaroid's battery division in Waltham, trying
to convince them to spend $2 million to $3 million (out of a total
R&AMP;D budget of $125 million) on a new battery technology
specifically designed for cell phones, camcorders, and notebook
computers _ a battery market even Duracell admits will be a $10
billion segment within a decade. In May I gave up and moved out.
</P>
<P>
   During my time as an insider, I was exposed to the ``25 new
products are on the way'' PR blitz. I would sit in the cafeteria
with employees and work through the numbers with them, pointing out
that even if all 25 were successes, sales might go up 10 percent at
best.
</P>
<P>
   But realistically, all of these products are junk. This summer I
was in Japan for a couple of weeks and got to see the ``pocket
camera for young girls.'' It's junk! A sad application of Edwin
Land's dream. Or how about the flashlight? Seven dollars retail for
a flat flashlight that has the bulb mounted on the wrong side?
Okay, maybe for $1.98. The flashlight was supposedly Gary's idea _
or worse yet, his wife's.
</P>
<P>
   Gary's problem (he is a classmate of mine from the Harvard
Business School, 1975) is that the entire Polaroid management team
is loaded with ``lifers'' _ people who haven't a prayer of finding
another job anywhere else that will pay them one-tenth of what they
get now. The tragedy is that everyone Gary has brought in
(including himself) is technologically naive; the people in the
plant used to call them ``DustBuster Engineers.'' These people
think that wrapping single slices of cheese in plastic is high
technology.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line for me is that my November issue of VIDEO
magazine arrived. In it is a 12-page, 4-color pull-out section from
Sony entitled ``Convergence,'' or how the worlds of computing,
still and moving images, audio, and communications will change in
the next few years. Somehow, I don't think there's a place for
Polaroid in there. But at $2 million a year for Gary, does he
really care?
</P>
<P>
   Please do the world a favor and call Stanley Gold and tell him I
would be more than willing to buy the battery division, and help
him find buyers for the other pieces.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GLENN WOODRUFF &LR; , &UR;  &LR; Belmont, Mass. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Steve Bailey and Steven Syre have personally insulted me and
many other of the 8,000-plus Polaroid employees. Many of us have
lived through (and survived) the Stanley Gold ``raid'' attempt, and
are now proud to be active participants in a new, market-driven
Polaroid under the leadership of Gary DiCamillo.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, under Mr. DiCamillo's direction, we have seen a new
Polaroid emerge _ a better Polaroid _ revitalized with
up-to-the-minute product offerings and a highly energized
management team. It has become a company that believes in open
communication with employees and customers alike, and that's why we
know what Bailey and Syre don't _ we've turned the corner, and once
again (as they were quick to quote), ``this is our day!''

MAN IN THE NEWS: JOHN GLENN, STRAIGHT-ARROW HERO  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ Two weeks before the launching, John
Glenn settled into a chair for an interview, one of many in the
buildup to his return to space. He had been in training for the
Discovery flight long enough to adopt the coloration of a new-old
astronaut, forsaking senatorial togs for gray slacks and a polo
shirt with the crew insignia.
</P>
<P>
   Here was a man, 77 years old, eager to get back into space. A
national hero as the first American to orbit Earth, he had once
made apprehensive Americans feel good again about themselves in
those trying times of the Cold War. Now he was getting a chance to
relive some of the glory of the day that defined the rest of his
life.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, the retiring Democratic senator from Ohio, had yearned
for a second flight ever since the first one. He sought to fly in
the Gemini project, which followed the pioneering Mercury flights
of the first astronauts. But President John F. Kennedy thought he
was too valuable as a hero to risk losing him in an accident. Glenn
had hopes of a place on one of the Apollo missions to the Moon, but
was given no encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I would have liked very much to go to the Moon,'' he
said. ``But I went on to other things, and that was a decision I
lived with.''
</P>
<P>
   With no second flight in sight, Glenn resigned from the
astronaut corps in 1964. He worked several years as an executive in
private industry and entered politics in his home state, going on
to serve four terms in the United States Senate that will come to
an end in January. In 1984, he failed in an attempt to win the
Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Glenn readily answered questions he has heard
countless times, but one seemed to stop him: If he had not become
an astronaut and famous as the first orbiting American, what would
the rest of his life been like?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I would have done,'' he replied, after a
long pause. ``I was a test pilot and I liked that. I suppose I
would probably have finished out may long career in the Marine
Corps. Beyond that, I don't have any idea. I might have studied
medicine. I always had an interest in medicine, but I doubt that at
that stage I would have gone to medical school.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a hero, it seemed even to Glenn, it was hard to imagine
what life might have been otherwise. But he was reluctant to talk
about himself as a hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure I'm the same person who grew up in New Concord, Ohio,
and went off through the years to participate in a lot of events of
importance,'' he said. ``What got a lot of attention, I think, was
the tenuous times we thought we were living in back in the Cold
War. I don't think it was about me. All this would have happened to
anyone who happened to be selected for that flight.''
</P>
<P>
   John Herschel Glenn Jr. was born on July 18, 1921, in Cambridge,
Ohio, and grew up in New Concord, a small town in southeastern
Ohio. Like everyone else there, the Glenns lived through hard times
in the Depression, but somehow managed. They instilled in young
John a rigid moral code based on their own example of Presbyterian
rectitude and saw him through an apple-pie boyhood. He played
trumpet, sang in the church choir and washed cars for pocket money.
In high school (now named for him), he was an honor student and
lettered in football, basketball and tennis.
</P>
<P>
   He still had time to court his high school sweetheart, Anna
Margaret Castor, the doctor's daughter. It did not matter that she
stammered; she was his girl and he loved her. They were married in
April 1943 and have a son and a daughter and two grandsons. Years
later, Mrs. Glenn underwent intensive therapy that virtually cured
her stammer.
</P>
<P>
   When the United States entered World War II, Glenn dropped out
of college to become a Marine Corps fighter pilot, flying 59 combat
missions in the Pacific and winning two Distinguished Flying
Crosses. In the Korean War, he won more medals for his 90 combat
missions. After that, he became a military test pilot. In 1957,
months before the first Soviet Sputnik, he made the first
transcontinental supersonic flight. He piloted an F8U-1 Crusader
from Los Angeles to New York in the record time of 3 hours, 23
minutes, 8.4 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   It was this experience with high risk and new machines that won
Lt. Col. John Glenn a place as one of the original seven American
astronauts, selected in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of people watched and listened and prayed that morning
in 1962. Two Russians, Yuri Gagarin and Gherman Titov, had already
orbited Earth in the year before. Two Americans, Alan Shepard and
Virgil (Gus) Grissom, had been launched, but only to the fringes of
space, not into orbit. Glenn's launching had been postponed 10
times since December, for mechanical trouble or bad weather.
Finally, Glenn squeezed into the tiny Mercury capsule he called
Friendship 7 and the Atlas booster blasted off.
</P>
<P>
   It was a short flight, three orbits over five hours. But when he
was safely back in the afternoon, Glenn's wide grin engendered
tearful relief and a widespread feeling that the country could
indeed hold its own in the space age and might someday, perhaps,
prevail. No flier since Charles Lindbergh had received such a
cheering welcome, with parades up Broadway and across the land.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by the Kennedys, Glenn plunged into politics. His
first two Senate campaigns ended badly. A serious head injury
suffered in a bathroom fall forced him to withdraw from a 1964
race. In 1970, he lost to Howard Metzenbaum in the Democratic
primary. With the same determination that served him well in
aviation and space, Glenn tried again and beat Metzenbaum in the
1974 primary and then easily won the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Glenn earned the respect of his Senate
colleagues as an upright and candid man. He worked diligently on
the frustrating issue of nuclear proliferation and developed an
expertise in military affairs and technological subjects. He
generally took moderate positions on most issues, though in recent
years his voting record became more liberal and he has been an
enthusiastic supporter of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In the one blemish on his squeaky clean political reputation.
Glenn was one of five senators present at a meeting with federal
regulators in 1987 concerning accusations of savings-and-loan bank
fraud against Charles Keating, a former Ohian. The meeting smacked
of impropriety and political pressure. Since Glenn had no further
contact with Keating, who eventually was sent to prison, the Senate
decided that he did nothing deserving discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's celebrity continued to draw audiences wherever he went,
but his wooden speaking style and lack of a cogent campaign message
were blamed for his poor showing in the 1984 presidential
primaries. He eventually dropped out of the race, which was won by
Walter Mondale.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the Senate's special committee on aging, Glenn
developed the medical rationale in arguing his case for a return to
space. He offered himself as a human guinea pig in tests of the
physiological effects of space weightlessness, like bone-mass loss
and cardiovascular and immunity system changes, and how they seem
to be comparable to the usual effects of aging on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   After the mission and his retirement from the Senate, John and
Annie Glenn plan to live in Washington and Columbus, Ohio, where he
is establishing the John Glenn Institute for Public Service and
Public Policy at Ohio State University. This will also be the
repository of papers of the man who made history by orbiting Earth
three times and, 36 years later, reawakened those memories as the
oldest space traveller.

BLACK LIKE BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  By BRENT STAPLES 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like it or not, African-Americans have inherited a historical
exemption that allows them to employ racial pejoratives freely and
even playfully. But the exemption has been strained to breaking
point in Monicagate, as black intellectuals struggle to explain why
the African-American electorate supports Bill Clinton so much more
vigorously than the white one does.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard sociologist Orlando Patterson conjectured reasonably
enough on the New York Times op-ed page that black voters rushed to
Clinton's aid because they feel historically vulnerable to
invasions of privacy like those committed during the Starr
investigation. The novelist Ishmael Reed stepped closer to an
incendiary line, writing in the Baltimore Sun that the
African-American affinity for Clinton stems partly from the fact
that the president has ``a black style'' and even ``walks black.''
The nobel Laureate Toni Morrison crossed into the fantastical when
she wrote in The New Yorker that Clinton is ``blacker than any
actual person who could ever be elected in our children's
lifetime.'' Explaining what she meant by ``blackness,'' Morrison
listed single motherhood, poverty, saxophone playing, and an
uncontrollable desire to eat at McDonald's. Emboldened by this
example, white liberal playwright Arthur Miller suggested on the
Times op-ed page that Clinton's ``blackness'' resides in the fact
that he came from ``a broken home'' with ``an alcoholic mother.''
</P>
<P>
   The deconstruction of so-called ``blackness'' might pass muster
as a parlor game, but it's lame as political analysis. The notion
that blacks cleave to Clinton because he does the pimp walk, eats
fried chicken, and reminds them of unwed motherhood trades on
noxious racial stereotypes and implies that African-Americans lack
the ability to make rational political decisions. It also
shortchanges the White House, which conducted a brilliant campaign
to court black voters directly.
</P>
<P>
   Any pollster worth his paycheck knows that political approval
ratings are based almost entirely on economic concerns. By that
standard, African-Americans have done better under Clinton than
under any president back to and including Nixon--whose enlightened
policies on urban aid and public health surely qualify him as the
``blackest'' president of all time. This point is borne out in this
week's poll results from the Joint Center for Political and
Economic Studies in Washington. For the first time in a Joint
Center survey, black people were more likely than whites to report
that they were better off financially--by a margin of 51 percent to
31.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's favorable ratings among the black elderly (100
percent) are astonishing given that this group disapproves strongly
of the death penalty, which Clinton supports with gusto. These
voters have given Clinton a pass on this issue, telling him that he
can burn the criminals he wants as long as black economic fortunes
remain good. Combine those fortunes with Clinton's support of
affirmative action and his appointments of blacks to Cabinet
positions--and 12 years of Republican assaults on equal
opportunity--and it should come as no surprise that blacks are
enthusiastic about this president.
</P>
<P>
   The White House helped itself with a clever outreach campaign
that went around the sometimes surly Congressional Black Caucus and
reached black voters directly through their ministers and churches.
The office that carried out this plan was officially
</P>
<P>
   called the White House Office of Public Liaison--but was more
colloquially known as the Office of Negro Affairs. Alexis M. Herman
ran this effort so well that she was later named secretary of
Labor. While at the White House, her job included bringing in
powerful black ministers, who were more than happy to take photo
opportunities with Arkansas Bill. They prayed and ate with him and
prayed some more. Clinton returned the visits in triplicate, with
church appearances that cemented his support--while enhancing the
reputations of the ministers he visited. When Torquemada arrived at
the White House gate, black ministers--many of whose church
services are broadcast on radio--unleashed a torrent of appeals on
Clinton's behalf. Faced with a surge among its constituents, the
Congressional Black Caucus scrambled to the front of the parade.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's church visits were more than singing and chicken
dinners. He delivered his toughest talks on welfare from church
pulpits. He realized intuitively what many Democrats and the
Republicans have always failed to see: that the black middle class
is prime conservative timber--angry about crime, intolerant of
social pathology, and deeply scornful of the traditional welfare
system. Given how this strategy paid off--pleasing both
conservative whites and the black middle class--Republicans like
George W. Bush will surely duplicate it in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Black people, particularly black Southerners, have endured
political contempt for so long that many of them have come to
assume that any white person who treats them with respect must
somehow be black under the skin. But the claim that Clinton has a
``black'' way of being not only goes too far but is also
sociologically imprecise. Clinton is a Southerner, like his hero
Elvis; what that means is that they both grew up close to black
people, with open access to black culture, a lot of which is
synonymous with American pop culture. The Baptist churches in the
South were segregated--but they sang the same hymns and preached
the same sermons. Given that most African-Americans have Southern
roots, Clinton's personal style and patterns travel easily from one
black community to another. In short, he is more comfortable in a
room of black faces than any American president before him. This is
what Toni Morrison and others were trying to say when they
described him as ``black.''

PAYLOAD PAYOFF 
</HEADLINE>
  By WALTER SHAPIRO 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chatterbox does not normally look to the right-wing viper's nest
that is the Wall Street Journal editorial page as a source of
inspiration. But when it comes to the sainted John Glenn, only the
Journal's vitriol-drenched edit writers have demonstrated (cliche
alert) the right stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's lead editorial, ``Glenn's Reward,'' bravely described
the septuagenarian senator's space spectacular as ``one of the most
cynical political transactions of the Clinton years.'' What the
Journal was referring to was Glenn's all-but-forgotten 1997 efforts
to scuttle Fred Thompson's investigation of the Clinton
fund-raising scandals. The Journal rightly suggests that Glenn's
Thursday liftoff has every appearance of a payoff for the lift that
the Ohio Democrat gave the White House during the campaign
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   This is one rare case where the facts are even more one-sided
than the Journal editorial. On July 6, 1997, the Sunday before
Thompson hearings began, Glenn used his appearance on Meet the
Press to publicly lobby for his last-hurrah launch into space.
</P>
<P>
   He was followed on the broadcast by NASA Administrator Daniel
Goldin who purred, ``I want to tell you John is an outstanding
astronaut and a great American. He has a burning desire to go back
into space. And we're giving it very serious consideration, and
we'll see where this goes.'' Where this went was toward a month of
non-stop obstructive tactics by Glenn patently designed to block
any serious examination of Clinton's (John) Huang-way campaign
fund-raising abuses. Chatterbox attended every day of the hearings,
and this was one time when Glenn was anything but an American hero.
</P>
<P>
   Like a money-for-access fund-raising transaction, no explicit
quid pro quos were needed. While Connecticut Democrat Joe Lieberman
won plaudits for his fair-minded approach to the hearings, Glenn
willingly took the role of an aggressively partisan mouthpiece for
the Clinton spin machine. After a quarter-century in politics,
Glenn didn't require any sign-on-the-dotted line promises from
NASA. He knew all too well how the Washington favor-trading game is
played.
</P>
<P>
   What constantly amazes Chatterbox is the willful amnesia of our
supposedly cynical press. A Nexis search revealed that, the Journal
editorial aside, not a single story in any major publication has
mentioned the Thompson hearings as part of the breathless buildup
to Thursday's launch. This is the week for heroism, and no one has
temerity to suggest that our living patriotic statue is standing on
a pedestal built out of Asian money transfers to the 1996 Clinton
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, a Journal editorial page writer would be tempted
to bring in the mysterious death of Vince Foster. But Chatterbox, a
portrait in judicial restraint, has the good sense to end this
irreverent item here.
</P>

CLINTON'S PEACE THERAPY 
</HEADLINE>
  By WILLIAM SALETAN 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last Friday, after nine days of talks under President Clinton's
supervision at the Wye River plantation in Maryland, Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
reached an agreement on the next phase of the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's critics could have denied that the Wye deal was a
triumph or that Clinton deserved credit for it. But this would have
been futile.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they diminished his achievement in a subtler and more
effective way. From a political standpoint, Clinton's true payoff
for facilitating the peace deal is to put the Monica Lewinsky
scandal behind him. His enemies are trying to deprive him of that
payoff by binding the two stories together.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton camp's spin in the days since the agreement has made
clear that its game plan is to change the subject. In campaign
fund-raising appearances, Clinton portrayed himself as a peacemaker
and said the agreement ``reminds us what counts.''
</P>
<P>
   On NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' when conservative activist Gary
Bauer denounced Clinton's behavior in the Lewinsky matter,
Democratic Party Chairman Roy Romer paraphrased the king of
Jordan's praise for Clinton's performance at Wye. ``This election
is not about that (scandal),'' said Romer. ``This election's about
leadership. It's about a president (of whom) King Hussein (said),
'I've never seen his equal in all the presidents I've known.'''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sympathizers in the media picked up this spin. Clinton's
``performance at Wye River disposes of the argument that because of
the Lewinsky affair he cannot be an effective President,'' wrote
Anthony Lewis in the New York Times. It also ``put (that) affair in
perspective. How trivial it looked compared with the stakes at Wye
River.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's Brit Hume argued that Clinton's achievement shouldn't be
underestimated. ``Bill Clinton is good at peace processes,'' agreed
ABC's Bill Kristol. ``Let's give him credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, conservatives slyly appropriated the theme of a Sunday
Washington Post front-page article, which suggested that Clinton's
vices in the Lewinsky affair had become virtues at the Wye summit.
</P>
<P>
   The summit, ``with its all-night sessions and constant brushes
with disaster, was a setting in which Clinton's penchant for
keeping all the balls in the air at once seemed to thrive,'' said
the Post.
</P>
<P>
   On ``This Week,'' former Clinton spinner George Stephanopoulos
confirmed the Post's thesis: ``The things that drive you most crazy
about Bill Clinton, in a situation like this, work. He can see
gray. He can understand both sides of the argument.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's enemies flattered him in the most sincere
way--imitation--by exploiting the ambiguity of the ambiguity
thesis. Rather than celebrate the transformation of his vices into
virtues, they argued that his momentary virtues will revert to
vices. ``It depended on qualities that he really had: doggedness, a
willingness to stay up all night, charm,'' said Hume. ``And yet,
like so much that he does, it was somewhat stained by this seamy
little business about Jonathan Pollard, in which you can't quite
figure out who's telling the truth, but one suspects that it may
not be the president.''
</P>
<P>
   The virtues-as-vices argument hurts Clinton not only by
cementing the Lewinsky episode as the defining moment of his
presidency but also by obscuring the ways in which he succeeded at
Wye by overcoming the vices he displayed in that episode.
</P>
<P>
   What will help conservatives most in their efforts to link Wye
to Lewinsky is Clinton's incorrigible narcissism. Hours after
announcing the agreement, he said in a speech to a conference of
religious leaders, ``I felt that it was a part of my job as
president, my mission as a Christian, and my personal journey of
atonement.''
</P>
<P>
   Personal journey? Atonement? Perhaps Clinton's enemies needn't
bother laboring to make the Lewinsky mess the touchstone of his
presidency. He's determined to do it himself.
</P>

FAVRE TUNES UP HIS SOLO SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JEFFRI CHADIHA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. _ Even while mired in his worst slump in years,
Brett Favre still wanted to sing.
</P>
<P>
   As a roomful of reporters awaited him Wednesday, he did a quick
rendition of ``Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing, Baby,'' the
lyrics streaming through his lips with grating disharmony. He was
carefree and for good reason.
</P>
<P>
   This, after all, is San Francisco 49ers week. BIG GAME week.
Favre's kind of week, for nothing motivates him like playing when
the whole universe is watching his every move. Pressure, you see,
makes men like Favre croon.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the topic of how he's been playing lately.
Favre has tossed 11 interceptions in the Green Bay Packers' last
four games. It's a trend that has flummoxed the Titletown faithful,
a following accustomed to better things from him, but they should
know why he's pressing.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers are significantly flawed for the first time in three
seasons and if they want to maintain their hold on the NFC, they
need Favre to continue doing exactly what he's been doing, without
the picks. That is, playing like everything depends on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say he's forcing the ball but we look at it like he's
made these big plays before,'' said center Frank Winters, one of
Favre's closest friends. ``He's been trying too hard, but that's
Brett's game. He wants to make big plays and you can't fault him
for that because he's won a lot of games that way for us.''
</P>
<P>
   A cavalier attitude has been Favre's trademark throughout three
consecutive seasons that ended with his being named the NFL's Most
Valuable Player. He's a combustible concoction of confidence,
recklessness and God-given gifts. No quarterback plays like him and
none playing for elite teams face his current circumstances. More
than any other season, Favre is about all the Packers have going
offensively.
</P>
<P>
   His targets have been wounded. Derrick Mayes mangled his knee
and Robert Brooks has battled a back injury all year, one that has
limited him to 17 receptions. The only people Favre consistently
trusts are big-play threat Antonio Freeman and steady tight end
Mark Chmura.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers' running game offers even more evidence of Favre's
woes. With Pro Bowl running back Dorsey Levens recuperating from a
fractured fibula, the Packers are averaging 82.6 yards a game, good
for 29th in the league. That's more than enough information for
opposing defensive coordinators.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be all right,'' Favre said of the running game. ``If
it doesn't work, then I've got to make something happen. That's
just the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the way Favre always has seen it, although a few years
back the Packers had numerous weapons to convince him otherwise.
They elevated to Super Bowl champions two seasons ago with a
complete team.
</P>
<P>
   They had the game's best player in Favre. Their running game
demoralized opponents in the fourth quarter. Their defense
delivered turnovers by the bundle. And if injuries hit, some
reserve unknown could fill the gap adequately if not impressively.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Packers are more vulnerable because, like every other
team in the NFL, they lack sufficient depth to compensate for a
rash of misfortune. That leaves Favre to generate his magic, a
responsibility he relishes. He hasn't endured such adversity since
throwing a league-high 24 interceptions in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a standard that I won't say is hard to attain every
week, but I expect to play at a certain level,'' said Favre, who
threw two touchdowns and two interceptions in a 28-10 win over
Baltimore last week, a victory that broke the Packers' two-game
losing streak. ``When I don't, I tend to be pretty critical of
myself. My performance last week, to me, wasn't any different than
the last three weeks. The only thing was it was effective enough to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Packers will take it. There's no other option
besides Favre carrying the team at this point. At 5-2, Green Bay
trails a hot Minnesota Vikings team and faces a brutal stretch of
games in coming weeks. The Packers play Pittsburgh, the New York
Giants and the Vikings all on the road after the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   Favre has played badly enough that he should be concerned about
killing his team in those games. Instead, you sense that, given
what's on the line, he wouldn't want it any other way.

`TALK OF ANGELS': OUT OF AN IRISH FRYING PAN INTO THE SPANISH CIVIL
WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: The production notes are at end of review.)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is there a trend here? ``Talk of Angels'' is the third and
weakest movie to be released this year in which the central
character is a beautiful, charming, clever, wise young governess
who becomes romantically entangled with someone in her employer's
family.
</P>
<P>
   As for the angels in the title, the question of what these
celestial beings might have to do with the movie at hand is best
left unasked. It might have something to do with the fact that
``angel'' has become a Hollywood buzzword for high-minded schmaltz
and phony nobility.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that ``Talk of Angels,'' based on Kate O'Brien's
novel ``Mary Lavelle'' and directed by Nick Hamm, imagines itself
as the Spanish Civil War equivalent of ``Dr. Zhivago'' crossed with
``The Garden of the Finzi-Continis,'' with a dash of ``The
Leopard'' thrown in.
</P>
<P>
   The sets are lavish, the scenery and costumes sumptuous, the
atmosphere romantic and fraught with a sense of historic import. If
only the characters didn't talk in romance-novel cliches and the
history and politics weren't boiled down to a simple-minded case of
heroic young leftists standing up to a corrupt establishment; if
only the whole thing weren't so badly butchered in the cutting room
that crucial dramatic confrontations are strangely missing, the
movie might at least have worked as a sudsy, aromatic bubble bath.
</P>
<P>
   Yards and yards of plot are spun around the story of Mary
Lavelle (Polly Walker), a young Irish woman who leaves home in 1936
to go to Spain and work as a governess to three young girls in a
wealthy but troubled family. Haughtily ruling the Areavaga family
roost is Dona Consuelo (Marisa Paredes), an ominous matriarch who
is so devoted to the church that she allows the priest who teaches
the girls piano to fondle his favorite pupil while giving
instruction.
</P>
<P>
   When Mary observes this behavior and reports it to Dona
Consuelo's husband, Vicente (Franco Nero), a doctor and poet who
mopes around the property with a faraway look in his eye, the
priest is dismissed and Mary becomes the object of Dona Consuelo's
suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Mary's status further deteriorates when she is seen dancing in a
public square with her employers' handsome married son, Francisco
(Vincent Perez), a political radical who falls instantly in love
with her. She resists, of course, but you know how these things go.
</P>
<P>
   The lovers get to spend one perfect night together when a
lesbian and fellow Irish expatriate named Conlon (Frances
McDormand), who is hopelessly smitten with Mary, grits her teeth
and donates her premises for a tryst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk of Angels'' offers the pleasure of watching two pairs of
pretty eyes (Ms. Walker's and Perez's) locked in misty-eyed mutual
admiration. But neither Ms. Walker nor Perez is much of an actor.
You could do just as well by studying a sexy television commercial.
</P>
<P>
   The story is so clumsily told that ``Talk of Angels,'' which
opens Friday, relies on a thudding voice-over narration by Mary to
make sense of things. Her final words, ``And that has made all the
difference,'' are typical of the movie's overbearingly portentous
verbiage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk of Angels'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).
It has sexual situations. &QL;
</P>

market (think of them as jumbo compacts or junior midsize sedans).
The Grand Am fits neatly between the compact Sunfire _ a twin of
the Chevy Cavalier _ and the Grand Prix, which is at the large end
of the midsize segment. By James G. Cobb. With Graphic and Photo.
</P>
<P>
   CAR-SMART-GRAND-AM-GT (Undated) _ Like the weekend jogger who
plods in designer Spandex and $150 shoes, the Grand Am GT strikes
an athletic pose. The front and rear fascias are even more
aggressive than the SE's; there is a wide-open air dam so the Ram
Air system can breathe freely; thick ribs run up and down the
body-side cladding; low-profile tires clench 16-inch wheels, and
the exhaust rumbles a bit through four outlets. But like the
occasional runner who stumbles into a time trial, the GT proves
itself a poseur with more flash than dash. By James G. Cobb. With
Photo.

   CARS-JUNIOR-JAGUAR-ART-NYT (Birmingham) _ The cat is back, and
Ford wants the world to know it. By Richard Feast. With photo.
</P>
<P>
   CARS-FLAGSHIP-MERCEDES-ART-NYT (Stuttgart) _ The next S-Class,
the luxury flagship of Mercedes-Benz, will be 500 pounds lighter
and loaded with high technology. The imposing slab-sided styling of
the current car will give way to a striking, smoother design that
Mercedes says will be the most aerodynamic car on the market. The
new model, to go on sale in March as a 2000 model, is lower,
shorter and narrower, yet it has more usable interior room. By Jim
McCraw. With photo.
</P>
<P>
   AUTO-REVIEW-BOS (Undated) _ Robert A. Lutz is not your typical
auto executive _ and that has to be the understatement of the year
in this space. The former president and vice-chairman of Chrysler
is a man of contrasts, a denim-and-sneakers mind-set in
double-breasted demeanor, a cigar-loving, martini-drinking
vegetarian _ and the guy who engineered Chrysler's second
resurrection from the dead. By John R. White.
</P>
<P>
   AUTO-SALES-OUTLOOK-BLOOM (Detroit) _ U.S. car and truck sales
climbed 6.7 percent in October, led by a 21 percent gain at
Chrysler Corp. and General Motors Corp.'s first monthly increase
since it was crippled by strikes this summer. By Paul Gargaro.

 &HT;    Fall's the time to prepare vehicle for winter driving
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   October is an opportunity to take a breather between the
back-to-school/fall sports chaos and the pre-holiday madness that
presents itself right after Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good time to finish up those summer projects, rake
leaves, plant a few bulbs and make preparations for the rainy
season.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this seasonal pause is part of the reason the Car Care
Council has chosen October as National Car Care Month. Now is the
perfect time to pay a little attention to that member of the family
that lives in your driveway. You depend on that vehicle to get you
everywhere. It's a good idea to give it a thorough check before
winter's weather and busy pace gobble up your time and money.
</P>
<P>
   We're looking forward to shorter days, lower temperatures, wet
streets, and in some cases new emissions tests for older vehicles
that require them to be reasonably safe to drive.
</P>
<P>
   Here's some help to get your vehicle ready for the upcoming
season. In fact, how about turning this into a fun, family project
that will teach everybody the importance of keeping your vehicle
safe and well-maintained?
</P>
<P>
   Make a checklist. Be sure to put the date on it so you will have
a record of when it was done. Write down each individual item with
a ``good,'' ``bad'' and ``get repaired'' column and a space for a
check mark or comment.
</P>
<P>
   Assign everyone a task. Maybe the younger kids could be light
watchers or horn honkers while the older ones can check the tires
and keep score.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start with the lights. Do all of your exterior lights
work? Remember, some of the lights will work only when the ignition
key is in the ``on'' position.
</P>
<P>
   Headlights, high beams, marker lights, right turn, left turn,
emergency flashers. How is the headlight aim? When you are driving
at night, do they light the road well?
</P>
<P>
   Taillights, tag lights, stop lights (including the high-mount
stop light), right turn, left turn, emergency flashers, back-up
lights (key on, transmission in reverse).
</P>
<P>
   Is there an under-hood light or a trunk light? Be sure to check
them, too.
</P>
<P>
   Inside dome light, courtesy lights, glove box light, dash
illumination lights (with headlights on), high-beam indicator, turn
signal indicators.
</P>
<P>
   To check the red or amber warning lights, the ignition key needs
to be in the ``on'' or ``almost start'' position. Some of the
lights may come on and stay on, some may go out immediately, and
some may flash off and on. All of them should go out within a few
seconds after the engine is started or the vehicle is driven a few
feet. If they don't, put a big check mark in the ``get repaired''
column.
</P>
<P>
   Ready with the list? Oil, temperature, charge or ``bat,'' fluid
levels, check or service engine soon, brakes and anti-lock brakes
(separate lights) should cover the important ones. Are your
windshield wipers working right? Wet the windshield and try them at
all speeds. They should ``park'' at the bottom of the windshield
when you turn them off. If you haven't replaced the rubber blade
inserts within the past year, now is the time to do it, before you
need them on a dark, rainy night.
</P>
<P>
   Check the windshield washer operation, making sure the squirters
are aimed at the windshield. If the plastic reservoir is empty,
refill it with washer solvent, not plain water that can freeze and
ruin the whole system.
</P>
<P>
   As long as you're doing inside stuff, check the heater and
defroster operation. Start the engine and give it a chance to warm
up. While the engine is running, listen for any abnormal noises
coming from the engine compartment. No squealing, clicking,
clacking, knocking or howling? Good. Any of these noises warrant a
description in the ``get repaired'' column on the checklist.
</P>
<P>
   Back to the heater. Move the fan selector switch through all
speeds, low to high, and listen to the motor. No growling or
ticking noises allowed, and it should change speeds smoothly. Move
the heater selector lever or switch to each position. Does the air
change outlets as the selector is moved? Heat on floor, defrost air
directed to the windshield. Move the temperature selector from blue
to red. Does the air temperature change from cool to warm?
</P>
<P>
   Feel the carpet on the front passenger's side floor. Is it dry?
A wet carpet can be an indication of a problem with the heater
core. Turn on the rear window defroster. The back glass should get
warm at each of the lines. Be careful! It can go from warm to hot
in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Next week: What to look for outside the car.

``LIVING OUT LOUD'': YADA YADA AS A WAY OF GETTING ANOTHER LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: The production notes are at end of review).  
 (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a lonely, newly divorced New Yorker in ``Living Out Loud,''
Holly Hunter does lots of talking out loud _ and talking to
herself, too. She plays Judith Nelson, a woman who pours out her
heart while trying to get her life back on track.
</P>
<P>
   Judith's way of achieving instant intimacy with strangers is one
of the more literary conceits in this, the first feature directed
by the screenwriter Richard LaGravenese (``The Fisher King,'' ``The
Bridges of Madison County,'' ``The Mirror Has Two Faces'').
</P>
<P>
   The filmmaker has borrowed from Chekhov the soul-baring
introspection that can be so ineffable on the page or stage yet
becomes so damply sensitive and dramatically vague on screen.
</P>
<P>
   In directing, LaGravenese remains very much a writer. He
conceives lengthy scenes in which two characters sit talking over
wine or coffee and the camera plays tennis, traveling from one to
the other and back.
</P>
<P>
   Enlivening this are wild flights of fancy springing from
Judith's imagination, as when she is seen dancing at a model-filled
lesbian after-hours club, vamping catwalk style in what looks like
a Bob Fosse music video.
</P>
<P>
   Free-spirited as the film hopes to be, it can't easily reconcile
such flamboyant departures with an otherwise static pace.
</P>
<P>
   But music does provide one big saving grace: Queen Latifah,
sumptuously outfitted as Judith's favorite bosom-heaving cabaret
singer and stealing every scene she's in. The sometime rap star
transforms herself sensationally to play a glamorous nightclub
performer who helps to change Judith's life, delivering sultry
musical numbers along the way.
</P>
<P>
   The ``theatrical consultant to Queen Latifah'' listed in the
credits (Richard Lyons) certainly got his job done. She becomes the
film's most attention-getting figure _ and the one least likely to
talk a blue streak.
</P>
<P>
   While Judith's trips to the nightclub buoy her spirits, they
also pique the curiosity of Danny DeVito's Pat, the doorman at
Judith's gilded cage on Fifth Avenue. (Martin Donovan plays the
successful cardiologist who married Judith, a nurse, and later left
her stranded there.)
</P>
<P>
   Being lonely himself, Pat feels a growing affinity with the
elegant creature who keeps tripping in and out of the building
alone in her evening clothes. But the loosely Chekhovian ``Living
Out Loud'' is less about a romance between them than about the
indirect ways in which they change each other's lives.
</P>
<P>
   A chance encounter borrowed from ``The Kiss'' (and featuring
Elias Koteas) is meant to trigger this, but again the film counts
on more magic than it can conjure.
</P>
<P>
   DeVito does shine in what could have been a maudlin role,
turning Pat into a three-dimensional figure and singing ``They
Can't Take That Away From Me'' with brio on the nightclub's amateur
night.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hunter performs more stiffly at times, but she brings
intelligence, thwarted passion and obvious depth of feeling to
Judith's struggle with her past. A sophisticated New York City is
also a virtual character here.
</P>
<P>
   The production design (by Nelson Coates) and costumes (by
Jeffrey Kurland) suggest a world of possibilities for a woman
trying to reinvent her life. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Living Out Loud'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying
parent or adult guardian). It includes profanity, brief nudity and
a scene involving sensual massage. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LIVING OUT LOUD
</P>
<P>
   Written and directed by Richard LaGravenese; director of
photography, John Bailey; edited by Jon Gregory and Lynzee
Klingman; music by George Fenton; production designer, Nelson
Coates; produced by Danny DeVito, Michael Shamberg and Stacey Sher;
released by New Line Cinema. Running time: 102 minutes. This film
is rated R. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WITH: Holly Hunter (Judith), Danny DeVito (Pat), Queen Latifah
(Liz Bailey), Martin Donovan (Bob Nelson), Elias Koteas (the
Kisser) and Richard Schiff (Philly). &QL;

   ``OPERA'S DYNAMIC DUO.'' From W magazine. One color slide. Even
for La Scala, home to the world's most factious opera fans, the
booing suffered by soprano Renee Fleming and tenor Marcello
Giordani was remarkable. During the first act of ``Lucrezia
Borgia,'' Fleming sings a showy aria while the tenor lies sleeping.
From her first note, a group of men in the La Scala's nosebleed
seats began to boo her loudly. But Fleming finished her trills and
roused her partner for a duet _ only to discover that the conductor
had fainted. Talk about a disaster. Find out how two of opera's
shining stars survived this performance _ and how they intend to
scale the heights this fall _ in this profile from W magazine.

</P>
<P>
   RELIGION-MORMONS-COX _ With the recent establishment of a
regional office here, Atlanta became the only center of Mormon
hierarchy in North America outside Salt Lake City. We look at the
new officials and at the growth in the Southeast that caused the
Presidency to send them here. By Gale White.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGION-GOSPEL-COX _ It's no secret that contemporary gospel
music has grown in popularity. But at what price? By John Blake.
</P>
<P>
   STAPLES-COLUMN-HNS (Undated) _ The preacher was recounting the
story about God parting the Red Sea with a big gust of wind from
his nostrils when my daughter looked at me and asked, ``Mommy, is
that true?'' ``Then why doesn't God do those things now?'' she
wanted to know. By Gracie Bonds Staples.
</P>
<P>
   NEXT-POPE-HNS (Albany, N.Y.) _ The successor to Pope John Paul
II is likely to be multilingual, at ease on television and black,
experts say. But he's not likely to come from the United States.
That's the estimation of the Rev. Thomas J. Reese, a scholar who
edits the Jesuit magazine America and is author of the book
``Inside the Vatican.'' By Chris Sturgis.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGION-COLUMN-BOS (Undated) _ In darkness of a Louisiana
prison, a writer sees glimmers of redemption. By Diego Ribadeneira.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; PLACES AND DESTINATIONS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BULLFIGHTERS-BAR-COX (Madrid) _ The men began to gather in their
special section of the bar about 5 p.m. This bar, like the historic
hotel that embraces it, is dedicated to these men and their
profession. The men are toreros _ professional bull men. Here in
Madrid, the men gather in Bar Manolete in the Grand Hotel Reina
Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS-GHOST TOWNS-HNS (Somewhere in Texas) _ Driven by a desire
to visit slices of Texas history before they rot away, my father
and I have been chasing ghost towns for years. Using T. Lindsay
Baker's thorough ``Ghost Towns of Texas'' (University of Oklahoma
Press) as our guide, we've searched for the tiniest speck of former
life at these deserted, desolate sites, driving for hours to relish
what usually amounts to very little: a cemetery, an old sign, maybe
a decaying barn. More than a few times, we've found there simply
isn't anything left, not even the foundation of a building. By
Malcolm Mayhew.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-VANCOUVER-HNS (Vancouver) _ Stretching for several blocks
along the harbor from Canada Place to Maple Tree Square, Gastown
represents the oldest section of downtown Vancouver and is notable
for its late-Victorian architecture and an intriguing variety of
restaurants and shops. Its most riveting attraction is a timepiece
unlike any other in the world. By Harry Shattuck.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-SAN-ANTONIO-HNS (San Antonio) _ ``Taxi, please!'' Those
are words familiar to any experienced traveler. But in the Alamo
City, your request may elicit follow-up questions: ``Do you want to
travel by land or water? By car, boat, trolley or bicycle?'' By
Harry Shattuck.
</P>
<P>
   VEGAS-BELLAGIO-TEX (Las Vegas) _ In one sense, the Bellagio
resort looks like yet another monument to the town's characteristic
overindulgence and sense of one-upsmanship. Still, you can't help
but feel awed _ the $1.6 billion, 36-story, 3,025-room resort
towers over an 11-acre man-made lake; the whole look is patterned
after the village of Bellagio on Italy's Lake Como. By Todd Camp.
</P>
<P>
   SELLING VEGAS-TEX (Las Vegas) _ Selling Sin City has to be one
of the easiest and most difficult jobs in the world. Why easy? Las
Vegas has a built-in reputation _ crowded casinos, gaudy shows,
neon spectacle, giant hotel complexes, cheap all-you-can-eat
buffets. It's a tourist magnet. Why difficult? All of the above. By
Todd Camp.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-COLUMN-BOS (Undated) _ Nov. 6-8 is going to be a weekend
to remember on Cape Cod. Inns, bed-and-breakfasts, museum homes,
and private homes from Falmouth to Truro will be on view. By Jerry
Morris.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-NOTES-BOS (Undated) _ Every year or so a new marvel
materializes on the Las Vegas Strip. By Richard Carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-COLLINS-BOS (Mattapoisett, Mass.) _ Buzzards Bay seems a
logical location for salty immersion and the ritual last swim of
summer. By Bud Collins.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CONSUMER NEWS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BUSINESS-TRAVEL-NYT (Undated) _ Rebuilding at Kennedy Airport;
airline update; rating trans-Atlantic airlines. By Jane L. Levere.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-WEATHERWATCH-NYT (Undated) _ For vacationers, La Nina
previews are mixed. By John H. Cushman Jr.

   TRAVEL-COLUMN-HNS (Undated) _ I get hundreds of correspondences
each week, and every traveler has his or her unique perspective.
The most common request, though, involves ways to get a bargain.
Now, a new book explores ways to travel not just cheaply but free.
By Harry Shattuck.
</P>

Piorko.

`JOHN CARPENTER'S VAMPIRES': DAD WAS OUT FOR BLOOD, NOW SON'S A
REGULAR DRIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: The production notes are an end of review)  
 (af)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amid all the religious trappings and walking dead of ``John
Carpenter's Vampires,'' the real miracle is how its cast was able
to keep a collective straight face.
</P>
<P>
   A compendium of mumo jumbo and claptrp interrupted by vampire
hunts, gory deaths, flambeed fiends and a battle to save the world
from a better brand of vampire than Bram Stoker imagined,
``Vampires'' never manages to be either frightening or suspenseful.
</P>
<P>
   By its end, a world that should be saved from movies like this
has, at least, been saved from a new breed of evildoer.
</P>
<P>
   Ridiculous without being awful enough to be hilarious,
``Vampires'' is chock full of exhausted lines like: ``Let's go to
work,'' ``Suck it up,'' ``We were set up,'' ``End of the line''
and, if I'm not mistaken, ``Let's kill some vampires, padre.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of this simple-minded nonsense, directed by Carpenter
(``Halloween'') from a screenplay by Don Jakoby, is snarled by
James Woods in the adrenal role of Jacky the vampire slayer.
</P>
<P>
   He is Jack Crow, leader of a scruffy band of mercenary vampire
hunters and a fellow with a background a psychiatrist would pay for
the pleasure of treating.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that when Jack was a little boy, he discovered that
Daddy was a vampire. Daddy was attacking Mommy. Jack attacked
Daddy. Jack wound up an orphan.
</P>
<P>
   Jack was taken in by the Roman Catholic Church and reared to
become its vampire hunter. When ``John Carpenter's Vampires''
begins, Jack is leading an assault on an old house in the
Southwest, spearing the undead with arrows fired from a crossbow
while he is attached to a cable that enables a Jeep to haul the
vampires outside, where the sunlight combusts them into what Jack
calls ``crispy critters.''
</P>
<P>
   (Later in this film, whose cast includes Daniel Baldwin as
Jack's sidekick and Maximilian Schell as an unctuous cardinal,
Sheryl Lee as a punctured love object and Tim Guinee as a young
priest, Jack makes clear that he is dealing with real vampires, not
those movie fakes. So no bats, no garlic, no satin-lined coffins,
although the old wooden stake through the heart remains an
effective remedy.)
</P>
<P>
   But Jack's raid has not been a total success. He and his crew
have failed to find the master vampire, and that night, as they are
celebrating their deeds with whores and beer in a motel, the
master, Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith), attacks. And what's worse than
the carnage is the fact that Valek knows Jack's name.
</P>
<P>
   Jack, already a poster boy for paranoia where vampires are
concerned, takes this familiarity to mean he has been betrayed by
someone on the inside of his Vatican-financed operation, although
why a vampire with telepathic powers couldn't pick up Jack's name
from eavesdropping on the chitchat at the party is never made
clear.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the plot is off and running into an effort to finish off
Valek before he can lay his taloned hands on a 14th-century cross
that will enable him and his minions to be like most everybody
else: sleep nights, work days.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like more of a problem for a labor union than a hired
assassin.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Carpenter's Vampires'' is rated R (Under 17 requires
accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes gory violence,
burnings, nudity, jokes about sexual arousal and plenty of foul
language.
</P>

RUTH AND HER SISTER, EILEEN, ARE NO LONGER WITH US
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to Ruth McKenney and her sister, Eileen?
</P>
<P>
   _ A.W., Granbury, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Ruth McKenney Bransten, whose New Yorker short stories
inspired two film versions of ``My Sister Eileen'' and the play
``Wonderful Town,'' lived from 1911 to 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after Bransten's stories were collected for the book
``My Sister Eileen,'' Eileen McKenney West died in a car accident
near El Centro, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   West and her husband, the author Nathanael West, were killed in
a Dec. 22, 1940, crash while driving to the funeral of F. Scott
Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Sister Eileen'' took a comic look at the lives of two Ohio
sisters who moved to New York City to seek fame _ Ruth as a writer
and Eileen as an actor. Bransten also wrote the books ``Industrial
Valley'' in 1939 and ``The McKenneys Carry On'' in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I write to Olympic soccer player Mia Hamm?
</P>

<P>
   A: Write to Mariel Margaret ``Mia'' Hamm in care of U.S. Soccer
House, 1801 S. Prairie Ave., Chicago, IL 60616.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm, 26, was U.S. Soccer's female athlete of the year four
times in a row beginning in 1994. Since joining the national team
in 1987 at age 15, Hamm has scored more than 100 goals in
international matches.
</P>
<P>
   Another accolade: People magazine named Hamm one of the ``50
Most Beautiful People'' in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I order CDs by Floyd Cramer?
</P>
<P>
   _ J.C., Burleson, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Several Cramer collections have been released since 1995,
including ``Favorite Country Hits,'' ``Vol. 2 Piano Music,''
``Super Hits'' and ``Blue Skies.'' These should be available from
retail outlets or online music stores such as CDNow at
www.cdnow.com.
</P>
<P>
   The Vanguard/Ranwood record label is releasing ``Favorite
Country Hits Vol. II'' by Cramer for the Christmas season,
according to Billboard.

   MOSCOW _ Just when you thought the Clinton vs. Lewinsky ordeal
couldn't get any stranger, a Russian filmmaker announced Thursday
that he intends to make the Bill and Monica story.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the deep Russian economic crisis, film director
Alexander Sorokin, a former KGB psychiatrist, said he intends to
offer Monica Lewinsky $5 million to portray herself in the
otherwise all-Russian feature production to begin filming next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrating that America does not have a lock on the publicity
and exploitation chase of Monicagate, Sorokin emphasized that his
story will be sexually explicit, like the original. ``If Starr's
report contains such details, why should we be more modest?''
</P>
<P>
   But he says art is the essence of the tale: President Bill
Clinton's private parts, like Russian President Boris Yeltsin's
vodka glass, are ``the totems of our times, the signs that
characterize the end of the 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorokin, who turned to writing novels and making films after a
career with the former Soviet spy agency, would not disclose his
backers, who are willing to put up as much as $10 million, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he hinted that they were Clinton-loathing Russian
politicians. Thus the location of his news conference announcing
the film project.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no coincidence that we are gathered here at the state
Duma,'' the lower house of Russia's parliament which is dominated
by communists and nationalist parties.
</P>
<P>
   If Lewinsky passes on a career in Russian cinema, a local
actress will play her, Sorokin said. It is planned as a feature
film, but also may be marketed as a television mini-series, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Finding an audience for the film in Russia could be the biggest
challenge. Clinton is popular here, according to polls, and the
scandal has received relatively little attention in the Russian
press. Earlier this month, the infamous report from special
independent counsel Kenneth Starr, translated into Russian, went on
sale at $1 a copy with few takers.
</P>
<P>
   Sorokin remains confident: ``I think the film is doomed to
success.''

WHITNEY REORGANIZES AND EXPANDS ITS STAFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It did not take long for Maxwell L. Anderson, the new
director of the Whitney Museum of American Art, to start making his
mark. After less than 60 days on the job, Anderson has announced
changes in the museum's curatorial and management organizations
that will add more rigor to programming decisions, decentralize
decision-making and require hiring two curators and three senior
administrators.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting Thursday morning with employees, Anderson also
promised that the Whitney would by spring be open six days a week
instead of five, that it would soon devote two floors instead of
one to the display of the permanent collection and that it would
aggressively expand its educational publishing and merchandising
activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two ways to manage a museum,'' Anderson said in
telephone interview. ``There's the caped crusader method and
there's the '90s method, in which managers have to have more
responsibility and more accountability. I'm choosing the '90s
method.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new organization, curators have specific portfolios,
such as pre-World War II art, instead of operating free form,
without specialties. To oversee the museum's permanent collection,
Anderson appointed Eugenie Tsai as senior curator, replacing Adam
Weinberg, who is leaving to become director of the Addison Gallery
of American Art in Andover, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The moves, which are intended to address the Whitney's
reputation for being trendy and somewhat chaotic managerially, were
approved by trustees at a board retreat last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``This certainly made sense to the trustees,'' said Joel S.
Ehrenkrantz, the board's president. ``Max's vision is for the
Whitney to be the internationally acknowledged leader in 20th- and
21st-century American art, and the second floor is really important
to that. He said how can you be, without having the permanent
collection on display? And he said it was important to be open six
days like the other museums in the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after arriving at the Whitney from his post as director of
the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, Anderson called in David
Bradford, a Stanford University management professor who is also an
instructor at the Getty Institute for Museum Management, and began
holding discussions with employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The staff raised a series of issues such as how clear
management was, who was responsible for what and an overall lack of
clarity here,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   On the curatorial side, for example, Anderson said that the
free-form setup was hampering the museum's ambitions for its
permanent collection. ``If you asked me whom to call to donate a
painting, I couldn't answer,'' Anderson said. ``Externally, people
did not know. We're trying to be more transparent, more lucid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The changes are meant to consolidate our efforts on the
permanent collection, both in acquisitions and in our shows,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to announcing Ms. Tsai's new post, Anderson
appointed Barbara Haskell as curator of prewar art; Lisa Phillips,
curator, contemporary art; Chrissie Iles, curator, film and video;
Janie C. Lee, curator, drawings; David Kiehl, curator, prints. The
Whitney will hire curators for postwar art (defined as that between
1951 and 1988) and for photography.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said he wanted to continue the Whitney's traditional
interdisciplinary approach in programming, but that planning would
be more rigorous.
</P>
<P>
   When Anderson was hired, the board signaled that it wanted a
more scholarly approach to the Whitney's much-criticized
programming, and he has added a new vetting layer to exhibition
planning. Curators will now propose and discuss shows among
themselves, as they have in the past, but they will then recommend
a slate of exhibitions to a rotating committee of curators, headed
by Anderson, who will make the decisions. ``We will sharpen the
proposals and move into scheduling,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new plan for the Whitney's second floor may also assuage
some of its critics. Until last March, when the museum inaugurated
its first permanent collection galleries on the fifth floor, which
are filled with pre-World War II pieces, visitors never knew if art
from the permanent collection would be on display.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after the museum's millennial exhibition, ``The American
Century,'' comes down in 2000, the second floor will be given over
to an installation of postwar and contemporary pieces from the
permanent collection.
</P>
<P>
   On the operations side, Anderson will soon hire senior managers
to oversee operations, development and external affairs, and he is
creating committees of department heads to make operational
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Whitney moves to its six-day schedule, for example, a
committee _ not he _ will do research and decide whether the new
day should be Monday or Tuesday. And the external affairs manager,
along with the head of merchandising, will decide how to expand
sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want it to grow significantly,'' Anderson said, and he
expects more product licensing and sales at the wholesale level as
well electronically. The Whitney's bookstore and museum shop, now
two separate operations, will be consolidated in the museum's
lobby.
</P>
<P>
   There will also be new publishing and research partnerships with
scholars and universities.

ART REVIEW: HOW EVEN POLLOCK'S FAILURES ENHANCE HIS TRIUMPHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A thought occurred to me while I was standing before
the earliest drip paintings in the Jackson Pollock show that opens
Sunday at the Museum of Modern Art: they are now closer in time to
the reign of Queen Victoria or to the production of the Model T
than to us.
</P>
<P>
   The prudent response to the first full-blown Pollock
retrospective in 30 years is probably skepticism, Pollock having
provoked, pro and con, too much silly verbiage, more than any other
American artist, probably more than all other American artists
combined.
</P>
<P>
   I should therefore begin by ritually deflating the Pollock
balloon: pointing out how bad his early works are; mulling over
their tortured symbolism and clotted surfaces; stressing how brief
the breakthrough period was, and recapitulating how he burned out
and died drunk in a car wreck in 1956, at 44.
</P>
<P>
   But what can I say? The retrospective, a landmark, is nearly
perfect. Restraint is pointless. If you care about art you live for
exhibitions like this, in which an artist, against the heavy odds
of his own skewed talent and unhinged personality, pursued
something so wild, untested and mysterious that its full meaning
was unclear even to him, yet who briefly wrung from his peculiar
system of painting one variation after another.
</P>
<P>
   This is perhaps the biggest accomplishment of the retrospective
that Kirk Varnedoe has organized with Pepe Karmel: bringing
together so many different pictures from Pollock's glory years,
they prove how little the drip paintings conform to any single
description (starting with the word drip) and how much they demand
to be regarded closely, anew, one by one _ which is what
exhibitions are for. It's funny how an old-fashioned formalist
re-examination of the art can seem like a fresh approach after all
the psychobabble and Cold War conspiracy theorizing and pop social
analysis that has dominated Pollock studies for years.
</P>
<P>
   It's as if the open-ended, free-floating nature of Pollock's
art, which for many people has been a block to seeing it and a sign
of emptiness, has seemed like an opportunity to fill a void for
writers from Clement Greenberg on. Varnedoe in the show's catalog
neatly disassembles Greenberg's arguments about Pollock, pointing
out among other things how rarely Greenberg, the formalist,
actually described the work in formal terms.
</P>
<P>
   One reason he rarely did was no doubt that describing them is
very difficult. I jotted down the following list while walking
through the show: Pollock's paint is slathered, splashed, flicked,
smudged, scrawled, poured, marbled, applied with a brush, with a
stick, through a pinhole in a can, wet on wet or wet on dry.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to legend, a lot of the paint is carefully, slowly put
down. Karmel has pointed out, for instance, an X shape with a hook
in a corner of ``Autumn Rhythm,'' which looks serendipitous but was
done painstakingly over time. Pollock developed gestures, like
handwriting marks _ elbow-shapes, X's, commas _ which may derive
partly from the Surreal figures he drew and painted in the 1940s,
although it's a fool's game to try to attribute specific meanings
to them. What's important is that they allowed him a certain
freedom: working on the floor, it wasn't easy for him to see what
he was doing, but he knew from experience what these particular
shapes would look like when he moved the canvas to the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, repetition bred diversity. Pollock built on these
established forms or gestures, varying everything else. The
surfaces, for example, could be powdery (``Lavender Mist'') or
crusted like tar (``Lucifer''), smooth like hardened stone, thick
and tacky or thin and transparent. Lines could hang like moss on a
tree (``Cathedral''); they could resemble a bramble or a nest
(``No. 5, 1948''), or they might camouflage an image (``Galaxy'').
</P>
<P>
   They may also suggest the looping calligraphy of Chinese script
(``Enchanted Forest'') or simply be spun-sugar lines floating
against a lighter surface. Often, of course, they are impossibly
entangled, black and white with other colored marks, so you can't
distinguish what's on top from what's underneath. One of the most
delicate, elegant works in the exhibition is a drawing (``No. 14,
1948''), which recalls Islamic filigree.
</P>
<P>
   To paint it, Pollock seems to have dripped black enamel into wet
gesso so that the thicker lines, like sperm-shaped swirls, bleed at
their edges into gray shadows, while thin lines nearly evaporate.
</P>
<P>
   The above descriptions are intended to prove, first of all, that
none of the pat definitions suffice with Pollock. He was always
trying to stretch the parameters of the narrow agenda he set for
himself, and if he sometimes botched the results, which he did,
this was intrinsic to a process that consciously flirted with
incoherence: accidents, upon which the art depended, had to be held
in tension with acts of control. The exhibition is instructive
because you see some of the failures, which clarify his successes
by contrast.
</P>
<P>
   His biggest triumphs are, of course, the classic paintings from
1950: ``Autumn Rhythm,'' ``No. 32'' and ``One.'' They are hung
together here so you can scan them by swiveling your head 180
degrees. It's an amazing sight. Standing a few feet away from them,
I had the odd and slightly dizzying feeling of staring up into the
sky.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean that the works resembled constellations, an old
metaphor for Pollock's art. I mean that they provoked a
disorienting sensation. The art has no center, no point of focus.
Most Pollocks, contrary to the myth of permanent epic scale, are
easel size, but these, which are very large, compel you to be at a
distance from them to take in a whole image while at the same time
you want to nose up to their details.
</P>
<P>
   Pollock is simultaneously a big painter and a very fine one, and
the way we are forced to move back and forth in front of his works
recapitulates the ballet he performed while painting them.
</P>
<P>
   He was a dancer in notoriously confined quarters. Varnedoe has
included a full-size reproduction of Pollock's Long Island studio
in the show, which some people will think is hokey but should be
instructive for those who have never been there: it shows that the
studio was barely large enough to hold the big paintings. The
famous Hans Namuth photographs of Pollock at work illustrate how
cramped it was, too, although the real point is that Pollock's
pictures always appear to be gigantic, even when they aren't,
because they somehow seem to expand in space.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in art since then, not Pop or Minimalism or anything
else, is as radical and audacious. It doesn't matter that other
artists dripped paint before Pollock; they didn't make of it what
he did. To play C-E-G on a piano is not to compose a Mozart sonata.
Pollock's paintings remain the central story of modern art in the
second half of the century, above all because they gave permission
to all other artists to break the rules.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Did I mention that they can be astonishingly beautiful? They are
often black and white. We tend to picture Pollocks in black and
white, partly because we know them from black-and-white
reproductions and partly because we focus so much on his use of
line. But it's another of the show's revelations to demonstrate
that he was a determined colorist. ``Easter and the Totem,'' for
instance, handsomely mimics Matisse's palette. Drawings from the
1940s are brightly colored like Miro's ``Constellations.''
</P>
<P>
   And Pollock's first great painting, ``Mural,'' is shocking if
you haven't seen it before (it almost never leaves the University
of Iowa Museum of Art, which owns it) because it's so vivid. At 19
feet long, it's an enormous panorama of soft pink, yellow and
turquoise mixed with black, almost a Caribbean palette, which makes
the swarm of compressed whorling shapes (like dancing stick figures
in a swirl of tall grass) seem to shimmer. The colors project light
and warmth.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise the last great work in the show, ``Blue Poles,'' which
curiously is almost a reprise of ``Mural,'' with a similar
friezelike layout, is a thicket of the most delicate spidery webs
strung like nets across a gummy, impastoed underlayer encrusted by
Pollock with bits of junk like broken glass. Totemic shapes, the
blue poles, more or less regularize the image, the way yard markers
do a football field.
</P>
<P>
   The colors are so bright they're garish. Pollock was, I think,
purposely vulgar at times. In life and art, he seems to have swung
between vulgarity and prissiness. In ``Blue Poles,'' he combined
them. The picture turned me off initially, then I came around to
it. Good art threatens established taste but, by persuasion,
gradually changes it.
</P>
<P>
   I began to see the work through the prism of Rauschenberg and
Jim Dine and Frank Stella, for whom Pollock set the stage. In the
same way, Pollock's early art can be located and explained, up to a
point, in terms of his many predecessors: Picasso, Klee, Ernst,
Miro, Orozco, Siqueiros, Benton, Ryder and so on. But we should be
careful about making too much of these connections.
</P>
<P>
   Almost from the start, Pollock had powerful advocates who saw in
his early work not a hodgepodge of Surrealist tics and sub-Picasso
figuration but a new and distinctly American sensibility. Mondrian,
no less, admired ``Stenographic Figure,'' which looks to us merely
derivative. Pollock was recognized as America's most original
painter even before he became America's most original painter.
</P>
<P>
   I stress this fact because Pollock's originality was not like,
say, de Kooning's. De Kooning, whose art remained rooted in
European tradition, spawned imitators, but Pollock elaborated a way
of painting so particular to him that it was impossible to copy
without seeming to fake a Pollock. Artists learned from him about
things like gravity and spillage. They got the idea of working on
the floor, using industrial materials and becoming, in a way,
performers. His legacy in fact was much broader and more
significant than de Kooning's. But it was less direct.
</P>
<P>
   And this helps explain why 50 years after the fact, it's still
hard for many people to see what's original in Pollock. They
continue to see him as Jack the Dripper, American art's first media
celebrity, a bald James Dean in black denim, a glorified doodler.
</P>
<P>
   It's remarkable that at the end of the 20th century, pure
abstract painting, which he brought to a peak, remains the most
difficult art for many people to grasp because content is still
commonly mistaken for subject matter, as if a picture with no
recognizable images in it can't be about anything.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what is a Pollock about? The question troubled even him. In
the early  &QL; 
1950s, he gave up pouring paint and returned to doing something
like what he had done in the '40s: painting abstracted figures and
other tangible forms. The results aren't all bad, but they have the
odor of desperation and are painfully miscellaneous: the last room
in the exhibition looks like a group show, the works are so
dissimilar.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Tuttle, the artist, once described the best of Pollock
as archetypally American because the work appeared to have arisen,
as it were, from scratch, out of its own internal energy. American
art, the best of it, anyway, seemed somehow self-generated. It was
about invention. European art, Tuttle said, was concerned with what
had already been done.
</P>
<P>
   I know what he means. Pollock didn't come out of nowhere, but he
was a quintessential American because of his aspiration to make
something from what seemed like nothing. Having said more than he
knew with his drip paintings, he clearly didn't know what else to
say at the end of his life.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, he had already, of course, said more than enough.

FROM UFOS TO YOU-OUGHTA-KNOWS, NEW MEXICO HAS EVERYTHING UNDER THE
SUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANDELIER NATIONAL MONUMENT, N.M. _ Forget Mesa Verde in
Colorado. New Mexico's Bandelier, a national park preserving
ancient artifacts of the Anasazi Indians, is 36,000 acres of
absolute wonder.
</P>
<P>
   From the battered remnants of cliff dwellings to the prairie
dogs scrambling underfoot, Bandelier has to be unsurpassed as an
inexpensive stop for budget-minded families who want to combine
history with rugged outdoor fun. In his indispensable ``New Mexico
Handbook'' (Moon Travel Handbooks, $15.95), author Stephen Metzger
bluntly states, ``If you've got even a mild interest in history or
anthropology, you'd be crazy to pass (Bandelier) by.'' He's so
right.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot to New Mexico that's well worth visiting; Santa
Fe is fun, but it ought to be just one of many stops on a pleasant,
relatively inexpensive trip. A six- or seven-day car expedition is
just right for Texans who don't mind sweating a little for their
fun without blowing the kids' college funds. Bandelier is waiting,
and so are Roswell and Carlsbad and Los Alamos ...
</P>
<P>
   YOU'RE THERE IN SIX: It's an easy drive from Dallas-Fort Worth
to New Mexico. Take Interstate 20 West past Abilene to Big Spring,
where you'll turn north on U.S. 87 to Lamesa. (Even-numbered
highways run more or less west and east, while odd-numbered
thoroughfares go north and south. You already knew that, didn't
you?) At Lamesa, turn left on U.S. 180 through Seminole and over
the New Mexico state line. It's a six-hour drive, tops.
</P>
<P>
   You enter New Mexico via Hobbs, a town that looks better the
smaller it gets in your rearview mirror. But the landscape begins
to turn rugged, and in another 70 miles down U.S. 180 you get to
Carlsbad. Stop here for the night; most motels are in the $55-$70
range.
</P>
<P>
   After dinner, drive 30-45 minutes farther along 180 to Carlsbad
Caverns. Each evening, rangers usher visitors in to sit near the
cavern mouth. Dusk summons clouds of bats flying into the early
evening skies. You'll love it even if vampire movies make you
nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Your real New Mexico adventures should begin at about 8 a.m.
with an early-morning plunge into the Carlsbad Cavern depths.
Tickets are $6; you can walk all 750 feet down or take an elevator.
Walk. If you're lucky, one of the ubiquitous rangers will stroll
part of the way with you, pointing out the many subterranean
crawlspaces leading to caverns still too newly discovered to have
been fully explored.
</P>
<P>
   A minimum of three hours is necessary to take everything in.
Ride the elevator back up; your tired feet will thank you.
</P>
<P>
   Roswell is about a two-hour drive north from Carlsbad. U.S. 285
is undergoing extensive reconstruction. Delays are inevitable. And
be forewarned: few service stations are in between.
</P>
<P>
   Roswell, of course, is famous as the alleged site of a UFO crash
in 1947. For more details, ask any ``X-Files'' fanatic. The town
itself is amazingly unimpressive. Any aliens arriving here didn't
do it on purpose. But Main Street is a hilarious sight, with dozens
of shops vying to sell UFO stuff to gawking tourists. Several
buildings sport fake flying saucers ``crashing'' into their walls.
</P>
<P>
   The UFO Museum and Research Center doesn't charge admission,
though donations are welcome. Inside is low-budget kitsch. There
are testimonies to alien sightings and encounters, blurry snapshots
of things that might be spaceships (or perhaps smears on camera
lenses), and a gift shop selling fake driver's licenses for L.T.L.
Greenmen.
</P>
<P>
   What rescues Roswell from absolute travesty is the
tongue-in-cheek attitude of the locals. Yes, they want you to take
the $15 tour of the alleged crash site, but they'll wink as they
take your money.
</P>
<P>
   Roswell is a considerable distance from anywhere else. Once
you've bought that bumper sticker displaying the image of an alien
and the words, ``Just Visiting,'' gas up the car and swing west on
U.S. 380.
</P>
<P>
   For the next four to six hours, you will see some spectacular
scenery, much of it probably glimpsed on this two-lane back road as
you're stuck behind an elderly rancher propelling his '62 pickup
along at 25 mph. Pass him and you're right behind his clone. Relax
and enjoy yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Here, for the first time, the horizon really alters from dark
blue foothills and the light blue smudges of mountains into real
passes and crevices and looming peaks. You're aiming for Socorro
and Interstate 25, but savor Capitan, hometown of the ``real''
Smokey Bear and now his grave site; Carrizozo, ringed by Lincoln
National Forest; and Valley of Fires, a plain jammed with
coal-black rocks that seem like spillage from a giant's barbecue.
Make sure you shoot your Valley of Fires pictures from your car;
guidebooks note that rattlesnakes just love slithering under,
around and over the obsidian-colored stuff.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   HIGH AND HIGHER: The speed limit on New Mexico highways is 75
mph, but apparently most native drivers think the ``7'' is really a
``9.'' From San Antonio, blast on into Albuquerque, one of
America's funkiest college towns. Nestled at the foot of the Sandia
Mountains, Albuquerque has become famous for its October balloon
races, the Sandia Peak Tramway ($15 a pop to peer down at the tops
of the mountains) and an all-around relaxed atmosphere. But
Albuquerque, like Santa Fe, costs a lot more than, say, Carlsbad.
They're what the industry calls ``frequent'' tourist destinations;
even EconoLodges will set you back $70 a night.
</P>
<P>
   After you've bummed around Albuquerque, follow I-25 on to Santa
Fe, but don't stop there yet. Follow any one of several smaller
roads _ they're reasonably well-marked _ to Los Alamos, a unique
community perched atop the Pajarito Plateau in the Jemez Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Los Alamos, of course, is where they developed and built The
Bomb, and the Bradbury Science Museum (named for scientist Norris,
not writer Ray) does a bang-up job of telling that story. Admission
is free, but you'll enjoy yourself so much you'll feel obligated to
give a small donation. Los Alamos also has a few other museums and
small art centers, one or two places to eat and a handful of
medium-priced ($60-$80 a night) motels. Figure it will take a
morning or afternoon to enjoy the town.
</P>
<P>
   Then head to Bandelier. Wandering amid surprisingly intact
ruins, studying the creek and fields and waterfalls, you'll feel
somehow swept back 2,000 years to when the first Anasazi inhabited
the area. The cost to enter the park is $10 per car. You'll never
spend a better $10.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Bandelier can be explored by even the most sedentary,
but there are also opportunities for visitors to prove they are
nearly as rugged as the Anasazi must have been. The Frey Trail is a
rugged natural path straight up a rocky wall to the canyon rim. The
New Mexico air is a bit thin even down in the valley; following the
Frey all the way to the top will take a good 45 minutes and very
healthy lungs.
</P>
<P>
   There's also an elevated ceremonial cave, reached by clambering
140 difficult feet up a series of ladders. The park's informational
pamphlet warns ``climbing into the cave is not recommended for
those with heart or respiratory difficulties or a fear of
heights.'' They mean it. Do it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's time for the 45-minute drive back to Santa Fe. Just
about everyone who visits New Mexico stops here. But I suspect
there are really two Santa Fes _ one for the locals, and the
Plaza/central downtown section for the tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Fe's famed ``plaza area'' _ that multiblock area crammed
with shops, restaurants, museums and dozens of sidewalk artisans _
is, like the French Quarter in New Orleans, deliberately unique.
It's a theme park for spending money. Whether you want a
silver-trimmed saddle, a carved wooden pig with wings or turquoise
jewelry, it's for sale somewhere within walking distance. The
museums are interesting, and many of the old missions are well
worth a look. But shopping seems to be the order of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Proximity to the plaza determines motel room rates, and there
are several nice hotels adjacent to all the plaza action if you
don't mind spending $125-$200. Call ahead for reservations; at any
time of year, they can be tough to come by. Most travel guides
suggest staying at one of the ubiquitous motels along nearby
Cerrillos Road, where lodging can cost as little as $45 a night
with AAA or AARP discounts.
</P>
<P>
   A ZOOM WITH A VIEW: When it is time to head home, take
Interstate 25 out of Santa Fe toward Las Vegas (New Mexico, not
Nevada). You'll pass through gorgeous canyons and savor perhaps the
most spectacular scenery in the state. Then it's a 90-minute drive
south on U.S. 84 before you connect with Interstate 40, which takes
you east on across the Texas border. Once in Amarillo, swing
southeast on U.S. 287 all the way to Fort Worth. That road offers
absolutely nothing interesting to look at for the six hours or so
it takes to navigate between Amarillo and Fort Worth. But that will
give you plenty of time to fondly recall the great sights you just
enjoyed.

SUPREME COURT TO HEAR DEPORTATION CASE OF PALESTINIAN ACTIVISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Nov.1)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After an 11-year immigration battle, the Supreme
Court on Wednesday will hear Justice Department arguments that a
group of Palestinian activists with ties to a terrorist
organization should be deported.
</P>
<P>
   The case gives the high court its first look at provisions of a
1996 immigration law in which Congress barred immigrants who face
deportation from protesting their impending ouster in the nation's
federal district courts.
</P>
<P>
   The case will be watched closely by civil libertarians because
the immigrants say they were targeted for deportation as a result
of their association with the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine (PFLP).
</P>
<P>
   The high court will be asked to decide whether the 1996 law,
which was designed to reduce long delays in deportation, went too
far in curtailing access to federal trial courts in certain cases.
The Supreme Court's ruling could affect immigrants challenging
deportation in a range of situations.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Justice Department, before the Illegal
Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 was
passed, federal courts were generally barred from hearing
deportation challenges until all administrative routes were
exhausted. In his written arguments to the court, Solicitor General
Seth P. Waxman told the justices that the law simply strengthened
and made explicit those limits.
</P>
<P>
   The only exception the law grants is for final deportation
orders. In those cases, a U.S. court of appeals is empowered to
review the evidence. However, the appellate courts are restricted
to examining only the deportation process, not questions of
constitutional rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   This restriction, according to David Cole, a Georgetown
University law professor who will represent the activists before
the Supreme Court, means that his clients and other immigrants who
believe their constitutional rights have been violated will have no
right to a judicial investigation of their claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is do immigrants have the same basic rights as
citizens,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cole added that requiring immigrants to wait until a deportation
order has been issued _ which can take up to 10 years _ before
allowing them to bring their case to a court of appeals would
amount to taking away their freedom of speech during the
deportation process.
</P>
<P>
   ``While an immigrant is waiting for three or five or ten years
for the order to come through, he's not going say or do anything
that could jeopardize his case, and that includes keeping his
political views quiet,'' Cole said.
</P>
<P>
   The case before the court began in 1987 when the activists,
seven Palestinians and one Kenyan, were arrested in Los Angeles and
held for possible deportation on charges that they were raising
money and trying to recruit members for the PFLP.
</P>
<P>
   According to the State Department, the PFLP violently opposes
U.S. peace efforts in the Middle East and has been responsible for
numerous terrorist acts and the deaths of many Americans over the
past three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the PFLP's activities, the Palestinian activists were
charged with supporting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   But their lawyers noted that the PFLP is also involved in lawful
activities such as education, day care, health care and sponsorship
of publications. They said their clients had done nothing illegal
in the United States and were targeted for punishment because of
their political views.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, blocking the
deportation proceedings and saying that the First Amendment does
not permit ``guilt by association.''
</P>
<P>
   After the 1996 immigration law was passed, the appeals court
re-examined the case. It noted that the law did close the
courthouse door to most challenges to deportation. But it added
that the law should allow people to contest their deportations when
they are making constitutional claims such as free-speech rights.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Palestinians and Kenyan said that they were targeted
because of their political beliefs in violation of the First
Amendment, the 9th Circuit Court ruled that their challenge could
go forward.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration appealed the ruling, arguing that the
9th Circuit Court of Appeals and the federal district court that
examined the case had overstepped their authority by intervening in
the deportations. Waxman contended that because of the 1996
immigration law, those courts never should have taken up activists'
claims that their constitutional rights were violated.

   GPCGPC- ATLANTA _ Genuine Parts, which announced another
acquisition to boost its auto parts distribution business, aims to
make another larger acquisition by the end of the year. The
company's goal is to return to double-digit sales and earnings
growth. That last occurred four years ago. More acquisitions are on
the plate for next year, in all four segments of its distribution
business. The latest acquisition of an Atlanta-based company that
services large fleets is expected to add to the GPC's earnings by 1
cent to 2 cents a share next year. (Luke, Atlanta

   FBC-COACHS _ ATLANTA _ Georgia's 37-17 win over Florida last
year could become a watershed event in Steve Spurrier's
relationship with the Bulldogs. For on that day, Georgia coach Jim
Donnan showed the master of ball plays that he had a few tricks of
his own. Donnan's play-calling thoroughly confused Florida's
nationally-ranked defense and caught Spurrier's attention. Despite
losing to Tennessee this year, Spurrier now believes Donnan and the
Bulldogs will be his biggest challengers to future supremacy in the
SEC East. Donnan, for his part, admires Spurrier and calls him the
best offensive mind in the game. (Barnhart, Atlanta

   FBC-GAFOOT_ ATLANTA _ One of the keys for Georgia against
Florida will be the play of the Bulldogs' defense, especially the

 &HT;    INTERNET FIRMS SEE BELT-TIGHTENING AS IPO MARKET FADES
 &HT;    With TECH-AUSTERITY-DATA. Moving in (w) Washington and (f)
financial categories for release Saturday, Oct. 31.
 &HT;    By MARY BETH REGAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Last spring, when Internet entrepreneurs Ross
Garber and Greg Peters were planning to take Vignette Corp. public,
they had visions of raising an amazing $30 million overnight. Their
Austin, Texas, company, they hoped, would join the ranks of such
Internet blockbusters as Yahoo! and Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   But before the team could even plan a road show to advertise its
initial public offering (IPO) of stock, their Morgan Stanley
bankers brought sobering news: In only 45 days, comparable Internet
companies had lost as much as 50 percent of their valuations.
Institutional investors were balking at new offerings. In short,
the IPO window was slamming shut.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wrenching,'' recounted Garber. ``We were so close. But
in the end, we couldn't taint the company by taking it public in
these disastrous market conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vignette team has joined the legions of executives across
the country postponing or shelving plans to sell stock to the
public. In the third quarter of 1998, a record 71 IPO filings have
been withdrawn, according to Securities Data Co. Some prominent
Internet companies scratching or delaying IPOs include
barnesandnoble.com inc., Healtheon Corp., the globe.com inc.,
Internet America Inc. and CitySearch Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IPO market is dead,'' says Gary Craft, an electronic
commerce analyst with BancBoston, Robertson, Stephens in San
Francisco. ``Internet companies are holding up better than most,
but executives need to adjust their strategies and valuations to
meet the current market conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   For Internet entrepreneurs, the darlings of Wall Street since
1994, the coming months could be the testing period that will
separate solid cyber-concepts from fly-by-night Web ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a belt-tightening time,'' predicted Guy
Hoffman, chief executive officer of Deja News, an Austin Internet
company that plans to hold off on any public offering plans.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capital _ pools of private funds invested in companies _
will continue to flow for the next 18 months, but investors may be
more selective about backing new ventures if market conditions
don't improve, economists predict. Some analysts even predict
investors will see consolidation within the Internet industry, with
weaker companies being snapped up by cash-flush firms at bargain
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't be able to put up a Web site and get money
anymore,'' said Jesse Reyes, managing director of Venture
Economics, a New Jersey company that tracks venture capital trends.
``The strong companies will survive, but the competition for
venture money is going to get fiercer.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, venture capitalists pumped an estimated $13.1 billion
into private companies nationwide. Of that money, 78 percent went
into information technology firms, mostly to more established
companies. Today, there's still plenty of money, about $5.5 billion
waiting to be invested. Reyes said.
</P>
<P>
   Of that, about 25 percent, or nearly $1.5 billion, is slated for
early-stage startups. Nearly all early money _ called seed capital
_ has gone into the Internet sector in recent years because
investors are looking for astronomical returns.
</P>
<P>
   The online flea market, eBay, was the last Internet company out
of the blocks before the market soured. Its stock price soared 163
percent on the first day of trading. And since its September debut
at $18 per share, the company's stock price has quadrupled.
</P>
<P>
   But with the IPO market drying up, executives such as Vignette's
Garber will be returning to venture capitalists for more money.
That could make investors wary of financing new projects until the
companies can get a product to market with their existing
investments, said Doug Carlisle, general partner with Menlo
Ventures of Menlo Park, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``The venture guys have been making money hand over fist on
these companies,'' says Mark Saul, chief executive officer of
Austin-based Acuity Corp., an Internet software firm. ``But the
heady days are over. So you're likely to see the losers float up on
the beach and die.''
</P>
<P>
   For Saul, brought in from Silicon Valley to run Acuity last
year, it's time to generate revenue. The company sells software
that makes it possible for clients to operate online customer
service operations or e-commerce businesses on the Web. Last week,
it signed its biggest deal yet, a $1 million contract with Ascend
Communications Inc., of Alameda, Calif. Saul expects the company to
turn a profit on a cash basis by December. ``We're in a good
position to ride it out, `` he says.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies without proven products or revenue may have more
difficulty, investors say. One example is Healtheon Corp. of Santa
Clara, Calif. The company, backed by James Clark, a founder of
Netscape Communications Corp., plans to raise $40 million from
existing investors after dropping IPO plans last week. But
according to the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, it has lost $71.7 million since its inception in 1995
and expects continued losses through 1999 because the business
model is yet unproven.
</P>
<P>
   Computer industry veterans such as Jimmy Treybig, founder of
Tandem Computers Inc., who advises a number of young startups, say
Internet entrepreneurs would be well-served to focus on the
fundamentals. That means coming up with a solid product, putting
together a top-notch management team and having a strategy to
introduce the product into the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these Web deals have gotten overheated,'' Treybig
said. ``But it doesn't really matter what's happening with the
times. ... You have to identify why you have an advantage, put
together a good management team and have a strategy to win.''

 &HT;    INTERNET FIRMS SEE BELT-TIGHTENING AS IPO MARKET FADES
 &HT;    With TECH-AUSTERITY-DATA. Moving in (w) Washington and (f)
financial categories for release Saturday, Oct. 31.
 &HT;    By MARY BETH REGAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Last spring, when Internet entrepreneurs Ross
Garber and Greg Peters were planning to take Vignette Corp. public,
they had visions of raising an amazing $30 million overnight. Their
Austin, Texas, company, they hoped, would join the ranks of such
Internet blockbusters as Yahoo! and Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   But before the team could even plan a road show to advertise its
initial public offering (IPO) of stock, their Morgan Stanley
bankers brought sobering news: In only 45 days, comparable Internet
companies had lost as much as 50 percent of their valuations.
Institutional investors were balking at new offerings. In short,
the IPO window was slamming shut.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wrenching,'' recounted Garber. ``We were so close. But
in the end, we couldn't taint the company by taking it public in
these disastrous market conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vignette team has joined the legions of executives across
the country postponing or shelving plans to sell stock to the
public. In the third quarter of 1998, a record 71 IPO filings have
been withdrawn, according to Securities Data Co. Some prominent
Internet companies scratching or delaying IPOs include
barnesandnoble.com inc., Healtheon Corp., the globe.com inc.,
Internet America Inc. and CitySearch Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IPO market is dead,'' says Gary Craft, an electronic
commerce analyst with BancBoston, Robertson, Stephens in San
Francisco. ``Internet companies are holding up better than most,
but executives need to adjust their strategies and valuations to
meet the current market conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   For Internet entrepreneurs, the darlings of Wall Street since
1994, the coming months could be the testing period that will
separate solid cyber-concepts from fly-by-night Web ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a belt-tightening time,'' predicted Guy
Hoffman, chief executive officer of Deja News, an Austin Internet
company that plans to hold off on any public offering plans.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capital _ pools of private funds invested in companies _
will continue to flow for the next 18 months, but investors may be
more selective about backing new ventures if market conditions
don't improve, economists predict. Some analysts even predict
investors will see consolidation within the Internet industry, with
weaker companies being snapped up by cash-flush firms at bargain
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't be able to put up a Web site and get money
anymore,'' said Jesse Reyes, managing director of Venture
Economics, a New Jersey company that tracks venture capital trends.
``The strong companies will survive, but the competition for
venture money is going to get fiercer.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, venture capitalists pumped an estimated $13.1 billion
into private companies nationwide. Of that money, 78 percent went
into information technology firms, mostly to more established
companies. Today, there's still plenty of money, about $5.5 billion
waiting to be invested. Reyes said.
</P>
<P>
   Of that, about 25 percent, or nearly $1.5 billion, is slated for
early-stage startups. Nearly all early money _ called seed capital
_ has gone into the Internet sector in recent years because
investors are looking for astronomical returns.
</P>
<P>
   The online flea market, eBay, was the last Internet company out
of the blocks before the market soured. Its stock price soared 163
percent on the first day of trading. And since its September debut
at $18 per share, the company's stock price has quadrupled.
</P>
<P>
   But with the IPO market drying up, executives such as Vignette's
Garber will be returning to venture capitalists for more money.
That could make investors wary of financing new projects until the
companies can get a product to market with their existing
investments, said Doug Carlisle, general partner with Menlo
Ventures of Menlo Park, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``The venture guys have been making money hand over fist on
these companies,'' says Mark Saul, chief executive officer of
Austin-based Acuity Corp., an Internet software firm. ``But the
heady days are over. So you're likely to see the losers float up on
the beach and die.''
</P>

 &HT;    PRIVATE FIRMS POISED FOR FUTURE TAKEOVER IN SPACE
 &HT;    880&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
for release Saturday, Oct. 31.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Americans relive the past glories of a space
race through the return to orbit of astronaut legend John Glenn, a
different sort of race for space is quietly heating up.
</P>
<P>
   This time the competition is not between international
superpowers, but among a handful of scrappy startup U.S. companies
who are vying to build space planes and rockets that would fly so
cheaply that costly government vehicles would be left in the dust.
</P>
<P>
   Even as NASA continues to rely on its huge and complex shuttle
system, costing $400 million to $600 million per flight, these lean
and mean space entrepreneurs are developing small, reusable
vehicles that could haul satellites and other cargo into orbit at
bargain-basement rates.
</P>
<P>
   Far from seeking subsidies, these pioneering companies have
openly spurned a government role. With minimal staffing and capital
scraped together from adventurous investors, they aim for
technologies that could ferry a satellite into orbit for 1,000 per
pound or less. That compares with the current world average of at
least $7,000 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for these economy-sized space vehicles range from the
conventional to the exotic.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kistler Aerospace of Washington state, off to an early lead in
this private space race, is developing a two-stage rocket launcher
whose Russian-built engines would thrust into Earth orbit. Each of
the two stages would be equipped with parachutes and air bags so
they could be recovered and reused. Kistler already has a contract
with Loral Space &AMP; Communications for 10 flights beginning late
next year, for a total price of $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   _ Two companies are experimenting with horizontal flyers that
would take off and land on an airfield. A space plane designed by
Kelly Space &AMP; Technology of San Bernardino, Calif., would be towed
as a glider by a larger aircraft to a high altitude, where it would
ignite its rocket engine, propelling it into space. Kelly has won
an $89 million contract from Motorola to carry 20 satellites into
space. Another company, Pioneer Rocketplane, proposes to use a
conventional-type plane that would take off from the ground
equipped with rocket engines that would be fueled aloft with liquid
oxygen from a tanker. Pioneer plans to begin flight-testing in 2000
at its headquarters at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the most daring technological venture, California-based
Rotary Rocket has a team of fewer than a dozen designers and
technicians working on a small, one-person ``space helicopter''
that would take off and land vertically and be propelled by
rocket-driven rotary blades at its base.
</P>
<P>
   Which of these concepts will survive to produce profits is
uncertain, but the demand for more launchers to send private
communications satellites into orbit has grown so large that
reliable and cheap launches would appear to have a bright future.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has just cleared away some of the obstacles by passing
the Commercial Space Act, which for the first time allows private
companies to obtain federal licenses for reusable space vehicles.
The bill was introduced by Florida lawmakers, including Rep. Curt
Weldon, a Republican whose district includes Cape Canaveral; Sen.
Bob Graham, a Democrat, and Sen. Connie Mack, a Republican. It was
signed into law Wednesday by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The sponsors hope that the new law will be a booster for private
U.S. space launchers, which have already lost business to low-cost
competitors in France, China, Japan and India.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marketplace has demand,'' said Frank DiBello, managing
director of SpaceVest Funds, a venture capital firm that
specializes in space industries. ``There's a whole raft of small to
mid-sized satellites that are going to need vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   He warned that the private launch companies ``will not all
survive,'' but said companies that have ``a very down-to-earth set
of technologies'' for going to space, and that are able to cut
costs dramatically, could prosper as part of a general
commercialization of space.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, his firm estimates that private enterprise, including
telecommunications and broadcasting satellites as well as launch
companies, is already spending more than governments worldwide. The
global space business is now estimated at $90 billion, DiBello
said.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's administrator Daniel Goldin has told Congress that in the
next 10 years he expects the government to turn over low Earth
orbit operations to private businesses and focus the federal agency
on science and technology research.
</P>
<P>
   It is far from clear that this will lower NASA's federal
spending much below the current $13 billion per year, especially
with the construction of the international space station.
</P>
<P>
   But it would mean privatizing most of space transport, said Bob
Walker, a former Republican congressman from Pennsylvania who was
among the earliest proponents of privatizing space operations. ``By
the end of the first decade of the next century, you could well
have more commercial flights to space than you have government,
including manned flights,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Now president of the Wexler Group of lobbyists, Walker
represents Lockheed Martin, the aerospace giant that has its own
entry in the private space race, and the only one with federal
assistance. With a $1 billion award from NASA, the firm is
developing a reusable vehicle called the X-33 as a precursor to its
planned VentureStar, a single-stage commercial space vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   VentureStar would be about the size of the space shuttle, cost
as much as $6 billion, and take at least six more years to produce.
Even the smaller X-33 experiment has run into design problems that
have delayed its first test flights until late 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see whether or not the VentureStar concept has legs next
year when they begin flying the X-33,'' Walker said. Lockheed
Martin is currently seeking $760 million in federal loan guarantees
for VentureStar, assistance that some of the smaller firms oppose.
</P>
<P>
   Walker argued that government support for such risky projects is
necessary, but nonetheless expressed confidence about the prospects
for private space transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really do believe we are on the cusp of some breakthroughs
in some materials and some engine technology and several other
factors that will allow us to get a very, very viable vehicle early
in the next century, `` he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And by the latter part of that first decade, I fully intend to
be on one of those flights,'' he said.

   _ Two companies are experimenting with horizontal flyers that
would take off and land on an airfield. A space plane designed by
Kelly Space &AMP; Technology of San Bernardino, Calif., would be towed
as a glider by a larger aircraft to a high altitude, where it would
ignite its rocket engine, propelling it into space. Kelly has won
an $89 million contract from Motorola to carry 20 satellites into
space. Another company, Pioneer Rocketplane, proposes to use a
conventional-type plane that would take off from the ground
equipped with rocket engines that would be fueled aloft with liquid
oxygen from a tanker. Pioneer plans to begin flight-testing in 2000
at its headquarters at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the most daring technological venture, California-based
Rotary Rocket has a team of fewer than a dozen designers and
technicians working on a small, one-person ``space helicopter''
that would take off and land vertically and be propelled by
rocket-driven rotary blades at its base.
</P>
<P>
   Which of these concepts will survive to produce profits is
uncertain, but the demand for more launchers to send private
communications satellites into orbit has grown so large that
reliable and cheap launches would appear to have a bright future.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has just cleared away some of the obstacles by passing
the Commercial Space Act, which for the first time allows private
companies to obtain federal licenses for reusable space vehicles.
The bill was introduced by Florida lawmakers, including Rep. Curt
Weldon, a Republican whose district includes Cape Canaveral; Sen.
Bob Graham, a Democrat, and Sen. Connie Mack, a Republican. It was
signed into law Wednesday by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The sponsors hope that the new law will be a booster for private
U.S. space launchers, which have already lost business to low-cost
competitors in France, China, Japan and India.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marketplace has demand,'' said Frank DiBello, managing
director of SpaceVest Funds, a venture capital firm that
specializes in space industries. ``There's a whole raft of small to
mid-sized satellites that are going to need vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   He warned that the private launch companies ``will not all
survive,'' but said companies that have ``a very down-to-earth set
of technologies'' for going to space, and that are able to cut
costs dramatically, could prosper as part of a general
commercialization of space.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, his firm estimates that private enterprise, including
telecommunications and broadcasting satellites as well as launch
companies, is already spending more than governments worldwide. The
global space business is now estimated at $90 billion, DiBello
said.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's administrator Daniel Goldin has told Congress that in the
next 10 years he expects the government to turn over low Earth
orbit operations to private businesses and focus the federal agency
on science and technology research.
</P>
<P>
   It is far from clear that this will lower NASA's federal
spending much below the current $13 billion per year, especially
with the construction of the international space station.
</P>
<P>
   But it would mean privatizing most of space transport, said Bob
Walker, a former Republican congressman from Pennsylvania who was
among the earliest proponents of privatizing space operations. ``By
the end of the first decade of the next century, you could well
have more commercial flights to space than you have government,
including manned flights,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Now president of the Wexler Group of lobbyists, Walker
represents Lockheed Martin, the aerospace giant that has its own
entry in the private space race, and the only one with federal
assistance. With a $1 billion award from NASA, the firm is
developing a reusable vehicle called the X-33 as a precursor to its
planned VentureStar, a single-stage commercial space vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   VentureStar would be about the size of the space shuttle, cost
as much as $6 billion, and take at least six more years to produce.
Even the smaller X-33 experiment has run into design problems that
have delayed its first test flights until late 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see whether or not the VentureStar concept has legs next
year when they begin flying the X-33,'' Walker said. Lockheed
Martin is currently seeking $760 million in federal loan guarantees
for VentureStar, assistance that some of the smaller firms oppose.
</P>
<P>
   Walker argued that government support for such risky projects is
necessary, but nonetheless expressed confidence about the prospects
for private space transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really do believe we are on the cusp of some breakthroughs
in some materials and some engine technology and several other
factors that will allow us to get a very, very viable vehicle early
in the next century, `` he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And by the latter part of that first decade, I fully intend to
be on one of those flights,'' he said.

 &HT;    Alleged malpractice by military doctor still an open wound
 &HT;    (For release Sunday, Nov. 1. Photos available.)
 &HT;    By Jeff Nesmith
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Andre Williams was treated for a simple ear
infection at an Army clinic when he was 6 months old.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later he weighs 28 pounds. He can nearly speak nor
stand alone. His mother says that when he sees other kids running
and playing, he gets an excited look on his face, tries to stand
and topples over.
</P>
<P>
   The Army denies that medical malpractice at one of its clinics
caused Andre to be severely brain damaged and has refused to help
pay for his medical care. Case closed. A judge will never rule on
whether an Army doctor was negligent in allowing the ear infection
to spread to Andre's brain.
</P>
<P>
   Andre, his mother and his siblings lived in Germany, where his
father was stationed as a private first class in the Army, when the
alleged malpractice occurred in January 1995. Therefore, the
parents cannot sue the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   Had Andre been a resident of the United States, they could file
a lawsuit in federal court in his behalf. But a special law, the
Military Claims Act, denies U.S. military dependents the right to
sue the U.S. government if they were victims of alleged medical
malpractice while living abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, military claims officers review requests for
compensation of damages. Aside from an administrative review _ also
by the military _ their decisions cannot be appealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system is inherently unfair,'' said Richard Gasperini, a
Richmond, Va., lawyer whose $10 million claim in Andre's behalf was
denied by the Army. ``People like Andre Williams are at the mercy
of the same military service that is responsible for their
injuries. The assessment is not done in a truly due process
fashion, and Andre ends up with a big zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Following publication a year ago of a Dayton Daily News series
on military medicine, members of Congress and military health
officials discussed changing the law denying 240,000 civilian
dependents overseas the right to sue the government for medical
malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   These talks ended after lawyers for the Defense Department and
the Justice Department argued that the change would expose the
government to a flood of frivolous lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers contend that the prohibition against court appeals
for the overseas claims does not affect the amount of money
received by claimants.
</P>
<P>
   According to Defense Department statistics, claims submitted
under the Military Claims Act between 1994 and 1997 resulted in
average awards of $70,537 each. Claims submitted under the Federal
Tort Claims Act _ the law which governs domestic claims of military
medical malpractice _ resulted in average awards of $70,706 during
those years, the data indicate.
</P>
<P>
   Gasperini, former chief of the Army's tort litigation division
at the Pentagon, says the statistics are ``razzle-dazzle'' numbers
brewed by government officials intent on maintaining the status
quo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys who review and make decisions on the Military Claims
Act cases are the same people who are knocking heads with me every
day on claims I file under the Federal Tort Claims Act,'' he said.
``They claim they put on another hat when they review Military
Claims Act cases because they know there is no appeal. This is
absolute nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   Gasperini said a claims officer who agrees that malpractice
occurred in a Military Claims Act case ``has to do more work and
make a determination about the extent of damages. But if he just
denies it, it just goes away. And it doesn't come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Statistics are little comfort to Greg and Carol Williams,
Andre's parents.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over the catastrophic outcome of the child's medical
care revolves around the question of whether a female German
civilian physician, working for the Army as a contractor, had
adequately advised the baby's mother of what to do about the ear
infection that caused her to bring him to the Army clinic on Jan.
11, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Andre had been running a fever that day, crying and pulling at
his ear.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Williams said in a sworn statement that she awoke around
11 the previous night to find Andre running a fever of slightly
over 100 degrees. She gave him Tylenol and put cold towels on his
stomach and legs to cool him off.
</P>
<P>
   She said she watched him through the night. At 7:30 the next
morning, she called the U.S. Army clinic at Butzbach, Germany. Dr.
V.A. Valenta, the Army contract doctor, examined Andre shortly
after 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Experts paid by Gasperini to review Andre's medical record said
it reflected a brief examination, after which Dr. Valenta diagnosed
the child's illness as ``left otitis media,'' an infection inside
his left ear. She prescribed the antibiotic amoxicillin three times
a day for 10 days and Tylenol for fever.
</P>
<P>
   The next notation on the medical record is at the center of the
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The record shows that Mrs. Williams was told to bring Andre back
on Jan. 18, when he was scheduled for a six-month ``well baby''
visit _ ``or sooner, if necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Because an infection in the middle ear can easily spread to the
brain, treating physicians must take special care to make sure an
antibiotic-resistant strain of bacteria is not allowed to spread,
two physicians who reviewed the record at Gasperini's request later
said. Because of that, both said, Dr. Valenta should not have told
Carol Williams to bring Andre back ``if necessary,'' but to bring
him back if he did not improve within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where I think she (Dr. Valenta) fell below the standard of
care was not providing appropriate directions in returning if the
patient did not get better or seemed to get worse,'' said Dr.
William E. Feldman, a Norfolk, Va., pediatrician and former
instructor at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Had Andre been closely followed, doctors would have known that
the amoxicillin was not effective against the bacteria that had
invaded his ear and could have changed medications, said Feldman
and Dr. James G. Zimmerly of Boonsboro, Md.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had the accepted standard of practice been adhered to in this
case, I am of the firm opinion that the worsening illness would
have been detected in a timely manner and appropriate treatment
would have prevented all of the neurologic damage . . . `` wrote
Zimmerly, who is former chief of legal medicine at the military's
own Armed Forces Institute of Pathology.
</P>
<P>
   But Andre's worsening disease was not detected. The Tylenol kept
his fever down and while his mother said she worried at his
continuing lethargy, he did not seem to be getting any worse. By
the weekend, her concern was mounting. What she did not know was
that the amoxicillin-resistant bacteria that had infected his ear
was spreading to Andre's brain. Meanwhile, the Army clinic at
Butzbach was closed for the long Martin Luther King Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Jan. 16, the baby was obviously sick and around noon
he started salivating. His mother picked him up to comfort him and
he suddenly became rigid in her arms and began to violently twitch.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Williams was on maneuvers with his Army unit. Carol
Williams called the military police, and Andre was taken by
ambulance to a German hospital.
</P>
<P>
   At the hospital, ``they tried to give him an IV and they were
having a hard time with the medication they were giving him to stop
his seizure,'' she said. ``And he just kept on shaking, kept on
shaking.''
</P>
<P>
   After a few days, Carol Williams said, doctors told Greg and
Carol Williams that Andre's ear infection had spread to his brain
and caused a dreaded condition known as meningoencephalitis. He was
permanently brain-damaged.
</P>
<P>
   The Army Claims Service denied Gasperini's claim, ruling that
Dr. Valenta's instruction to bring Andre back to the hospital
``sooner, if necessary'' was sufficient to meet the standard of
care.
</P>
<P>
   ``A physician should reasonably expect that a parent who
observes that a child is not progressively improving will seek
further medical attention for that child,'' ruled Lt. Col. James P.
Gerstenlauer, chief of the Army Tort Claims Division, on Feb. 28,
1997. Gasperini requested a review of the decision by the Secretary
of the Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are blaming the mother for what happened,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, on Aug. 14, Col. Denise K. Vowell, acting
commanding officer of the claims service, wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``After careful consideration of the evidence, the Army's
designee has denied the appeal and disapproved the claim. Under the
provisions of Title 10, United States Code, Section 2735, this
action is final and conclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Williams was honorably discharged by the Army on Nov. 1,
1995, and moved his family to Flint, Mich. He has worked at several
jobs, most recently, he worked for the U.S. Postal Service, from
which he says he has been laid off.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Andre's medical care is being paid for by the Michigan
Medicaid program.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the couple filed the claim not to seek retribution
against the Army but to ensure that Andre's medical bills would be
covered.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could have stepped up and done what was right,'' he said.
``He can't walk. He can't sit up. He can't talk. But he's a happy
kid. He's an angel and he's a blessing to us.

 &HT;    Requirements still different for military doctors
 &HT;    By Russell Carollo and Jeff Nesmith
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, D.C. _ Top military officials acknowledge that
significant barriers continue to prevent military physicians from
meeting the same standards as their civilian counterparts, even as
Congress and the Department of Defense try to force state medical
boards to stop giving special treatment to doctors in the armed
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're troubled by it,'' said John F. Mazzuchi, deputy
assistant secretary of defense for clinical services. ``We don't
have a solution.''
</P>
<P>
   An examination by top military health officials disclosed that
as many as a dozen states have set up special licensing procedures
for military doctors that free them from meeting some of the same
requirements as civilian doctors. In some cases, Mazzuchi said, the
states exempted military doctors because of a desire to be
patriotic.
</P>
<P>
   The examination by the Office of Assistant Secretary of Defense
for Health Affairs came in response to a seven-part series
published in the Dayton Daily News a year ago. The series found
that the bulk of the safeguards protecting civilians from medical
malpractice do not exist in the military or, in many cases, for
their spouses and children.
</P>
<P>
   Although the military implemented a number of changes in
response to the series, the most significant problems highlighted
in the articles remain.
</P>
<P>
   Military doctors, the series disclosed, are virtually immune
from being sued by their patients, they are not required to have
malpractice insurance and they do not have to be licensed in the
states where they practice.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper also found that at least 77 doctors practiced in
the armed services with ``special'' licenses issued only to doctors
at military bases, Indian reservations, mental hospitals, prisons
and labs handling organs for transplants _ a problem the department
moved to correct.
</P>
<P>
   Following publication of the series, the Department of Defense
acknowledged that its medical system had serious problems, and top
military officials proposed changes to make the services' almost
600 hospitals and clinics safer.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzuchi, during an interview at the Pentagon, said the services
are now requiring that all military doctors pay the same licensing
fees and meet the same educational requirements as their civilian
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, President Clinton has signed into law a provision
passed by Congress last month that requires all military doctors to
have unrestricted licenses, the same requirement civilian doctors
must meet.
</P>
<P>
   And Mazzuchi said the military now requires doctors with the
special Oklahoma licenses to either obtain unrestricted state
medical licenses or face separation from the military. He said 18
of the ``Oklahoma doctors'' remain in the services: seven each in
the Army and Navy and four in the Air Force. The Department of
Defense has given the doctors until April 1999 to get unrestricted
licenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will accept no practice limitation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the changes appear to have tightened oversight of
doctors who practice in the military. However, about 1.7 million
active-duty military members and their dependents overseas are
still barred from collecting damages from medical malpractice
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   And none of the proposed changes by Congress or the military
will force doctors in the military to be licensed in states where
they practice or force military doctors to get malpractice
insurance. Civilian doctors with a history of problems can be
forced out of business because they can't get malpractice
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're putting a Band-Aid on a hemorrhage. That's what they're
doing,'' Jacksonville, Fla., attorney Donald Maciejewski, former
chairman of the Federal Tort Liability and Military Advocacy
Section of the Association of Trial Lawyers of America, said of the
military's reforms. ``Unless military physicians are held to the
same standard as civilian physicians and unless the United States
is held financially liable, nothing will change.''
</P>
<P>
   State medical licensing agencies have, to a large extent, geared
their monitoring efforts toward doctors who practice in states
where they are licensed, doctors who can be sued and doctors who
are required to have malpractice insurance. As a result, Mazzuchi
said, states will continue having difficulty monitoring military
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Some states ``do not consider (military doctors) part of the
state, but, therefore, really didn't pay a whole lot of
attention,'' Mazzuchi said.
</P>
<P>
   One solution would be to go to federal licensing, but Mazzuchi
said that under such a system the military would be accused of
policing its own doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News series revealed that the military controlled much
of the information about its doctors and often was reluctant to
share the information with civilian authorities, which license the
doctors and hire them when they leave the military.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzuchi acknowledged that the military has been underreporting
cases to the National Practitioner Data Bank, a computer database
of malpractice payments and disciplinary actions against doctors.
Medical boards review the records when making licensing decisions
and hospitals screen doctors through the database before allowing
them to treat patients.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the federal government created the database to track
the kind of doctors serving in the military: doctors who frequently
move from state to state, doctors whose mistakes might not be
caught by existing safeguards, and doctors who fell through the
cracks of the system of protections used by state medical boards.
But the services were given separate, less-restrictive rules for
reporting doctors, and even under those less-restrictive standards,
the military didn't report all the doctors it was supposed to.
</P>
<P>
   ``The services were very sluggish in reporting, and a lot of the
uniformed services were not reporting much of anybody,'' Mazzuchi
said. ``And this clearly was a violation of the spirit of the
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   To improve reporting, Mazzuchi said, the Pentagon asked a
civilian contractor to review all cases since January 1998 in which
the services recommended that a doctor not be reported even though
the government made a payment in a medical malpractice case.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new system, if the contractor concludes that the case
should be reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank, only the
surgeon general of the affected service can overrule the decision.
</P>
<P>
   However, a Daily News review of DOD reports to the database
since January shows military doctors still are less likely to be
reported than their civilian counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   From January through August of 1998, civilian doctors were
reported to the database for malpractice at more than twice the
rate of military doctors. Still, the disparity is significantly
less than in previous years.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the disparity in the reporting is due to the legal
protection afforded doctors in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Because lawsuits cannot be filed for acts of medical malpractice
against active-duty personnel, an undetermined number of lawsuits
that would have been reported are never filed against military
doctors. When civilian patients _ dependents, retirees and others _
do sue military doctors, they file their lawsuits in federal
courts, which require that the government, not the doctors, be
named as defendants.
</P>
<P>
   When the cases are settled, the military still doesn't report
the case unless it decides that the doctor violated the so-called
``standard of care'' and that the doctor, not the ``system,'' was
responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzuchi said the military will continue to refuse to report all
paid claims. He said a similar ``corporate shield'' protects
civilian doctors when settlements are made by an HMO or a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was only when corporate veil came out that we changed the
way we focused,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A regulation now under consideration for the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services, which oversees the database, seeks to
remove the corporate shield for civilian doctors. However, a top
official at that department said he is not convinced such a change
would raise the level of reporting in the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll believe it when I see it,'' said Tom Croft, director of
quality assurance for the Department of Health and Human Services
Board of Health Professionals. ``They (the military) have got eight
years of practice tradition here they have to overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Mazzuchi said the Daily News series pushed the military to
develop a better health care system, one that protects the rights
of both doctors and patients.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in March, hospitals were required to post report cards
in the hospitals and on the Internet. A sample report provided by
Mazzuchi showed that the patients were more satisfied and the staff
more qualified at Martin Army Community Hospital compared to the
average civilian hospital. The Army hospital, according to the
document provided by Mazzuchi, received an overall score of 98 out
of 100, compared to a civilian average of 92.
</P>
<P>
   The services also formed patient advisory groups at every
hospital, Mazzuchi said. The groups will be made up of mostly
enlisted personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did this not only to help address quality problems...We're
concerned about attitude, waiting time,'' Mazzuchi said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, and U.S. Rep. David Hobson,
R-Ohio, said the changes, which they helped implement, will improve
the quality of health care for military families.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am encouraged by the steps the military has taken as a
direct result of our congressional hearings and the media interest
in this issue,'' Hobson said. ``This was a top priority for me this
year, and if we save one military family the unnecessary trauma and
heartache of a poorly performed medical procedure it will have been
well worth the effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Hobson said the defense budget includes $5 million for the
development of identification tags containing a computer chip that
includes a service member's medical records. The Army proposed the
idea some time ago, Hobson said, but revived it in response to the
newspaper series, which reported problems with lost medical files.
</P>
<P>
   Both DeWine and Hobson agreed that more may have to be done.
</P>
<P>
   DeWine said he wants to wait on a report from a special Blue
Ribbon committee, which is due in December, before deciding on
additional changes. He said he would consider making the military
legally bound _ as civilians are _ to report to the National
Practitioner Data Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's an area we need to look at,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   DeWine also said he would consider giving military members the
right to sue the government in medical malpractice cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how you morally justify making people in the
military second-class citizens: not being able to file lawsuits
other citizens can file,'' DeWine said. ``We should look to protect
those in the military. They are the ones who protect us.''

</P>
<P>
   An examination by top military health officials disclosed that
as many as a dozen states have set up special licensing procedures
for military doctors that free them from meeting some of the same
requirements as civilian doctors. In some cases, Mazzuchi said, the
states exempted military doctors because of a desire to be
patriotic.
</P>
<P>
   The examination by the Office of Assistant Secretary of Defense
for Health Affairs came in response to a seven-part series
published in the Dayton Daily News a year ago. The series found
that the bulk of the safeguards protecting civilians from medical
malpractice do not exist in the military or, in many cases, for
their spouses and children.
</P>
<P>
   Although the military implemented a number of changes in
response to the series, the most significant problems highlighted
in the articles remain.
</P>
<P>
   Military doctors, the series disclosed, are virtually immune
from being sued by their patients, they are not required to have
malpractice insurance and they do not have to be licensed in the
states where they practice.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper also found that at least 77 doctors practiced in
the armed services with ``special'' licenses issued only to doctors
at military bases, Indian reservations, mental hospitals, prisons
and labs handling organs for transplants _ a problem the department
moved to correct.
</P>
<P>
   Following publication of the series, the Department of Defense
acknowledged that its medical system had serious problems, and top
military officials proposed changes to make the services' almost
600 hospitals and clinics safer.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzuchi, during an interview at the Pentagon, said the services
are now requiring that all military doctors pay the same licensing
fees and meet the same educational requirements as their civilian
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, President Clinton has signed into law a provision
passed by Congress last month that requires all military doctors to
have unrestricted licenses, the same requirement civilian doctors
must meet.
</P>
<P>
   And Mazzuchi said the military now requires doctors with the
special Oklahoma licenses to either obtain unrestricted state
medical licenses or face separation from the military. He said 18
of the ``Oklahoma doctors'' remain in the services: seven each in
the Army and Navy and four in the Air Force. The Department of
Defense has given the doctors until April 1999 to get unrestricted
licenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will accept no practice limitation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the changes appear to have tightened oversight of
doctors who practice in the military. However, about 1.7 million
active-duty military members and their dependents overseas are
still barred from collecting damages from medical malpractice
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   And none of the proposed changes by Congress or the military
will force doctors in the military to be licensed in states where
they practice or force military doctors to get malpractice
insurance. Civilian doctors with a history of problems can be
forced out of business because they can't get malpractice
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're putting a Band-Aid on a hemorrhage. That's what they're
doing,'' Jacksonville, Fla., attorney Donald Maciejewski, former
chairman of the Federal Tort Liability and Military Advocacy
Section of the Association of Trial Lawyers of America, said of the
military's reforms. ``Unless military physicians are held to the
same standard as civilian physicians and unless the United States
is held financially liable, nothing will change.''
</P>
<P>
   State medical licensing agencies have, to a large extent, geared
their monitoring efforts toward doctors who practice in states
where they are licensed, doctors who can be sued and doctors who
are required to have malpractice insurance. As a result, Mazzuchi
said, states will continue having difficulty monitoring military
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Some states ``do not consider (military doctors) part of the
state, but, therefore, really didn't pay a whole lot of
attention,'' Mazzuchi said.
</P>
<P>
   One solution would be to go to federal licensing, but Mazzuchi
said that under such a system the military would be accused of
policing its own doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News series revealed that the military controlled much
of the information about its doctors and often was reluctant to
share the information with civilian authorities, which license the
doctors and hire them when they leave the military.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzuchi acknowledged that the military has been underreporting
cases to the National Practitioner Data Bank, a computer database
of malpractice payments and disciplinary actions against doctors.
Medical boards review the records when making licensing decisions
and hospitals screen doctors through the database before allowing
them to treat patients.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the federal government created the database to track
the kind of doctors serving in the military: doctors who frequently
move from state to state, doctors whose mistakes might not be
caught by existing safeguards, and doctors who fell through the
cracks of the system of protections used by state medical boards.
But the services were given separate, less-restrictive rules for
reporting doctors, and even under those less-restrictive standards,
the military didn't report all the doctors it was supposed to.
</P>
<P>
   ``The services were very sluggish in reporting, and a lot of the
uniformed services were not reporting much of anybody,'' Mazzuchi
said. ``And this clearly was a violation of the spirit of the
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   To improve reporting, Mazzuchi said, the Pentagon asked a
civilian contractor to review all cases since January 1998 in which
the services recommended that a doctor not be reported even though
the government made a payment in a medical malpractice case.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new system, if the contractor concludes that the case
should be reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank, only the
surgeon general of the affected service can overrule the decision.
</P>
<P>
   However, a Daily News review of DOD reports to the database
since January shows military doctors still are less likely to be
reported than their civilian counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   From January through August of 1998, civilian doctors were
reported to the database for malpractice at more than twice the
rate of military doctors. Still, the disparity is significantly
less than in previous years.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the disparity in the reporting is due to the legal
protection afforded doctors in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Because lawsuits cannot be filed for acts of medical malpractice
against active-duty personnel, an undetermined number of lawsuits
that would have been reported are never filed against military
doctors. When civilian patients _ dependents, retirees and others _
do sue military doctors, they file their lawsuits in federal
courts, which require that the government, not the doctors, be
named as defendants.
</P>
<P>
   When the cases are settled, the military still doesn't report
the case unless it decides that the doctor violated the so-called
``standard of care'' and that the doctor, not the ``system,'' was
responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzuchi said the military will continue to refuse to report all
paid claims. He said a similar ``corporate shield'' protects
civilian doctors when settlements are made by an HMO or a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was only when corporate veil came out that we changed the
way we focused,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A regulation now under consideration for the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services, which oversees the database, seeks to
remove the corporate shield for civilian doctors. However, a top
official at that department said he is not convinced such a change
would raise the level of reporting in the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll believe it when I see it,'' said Tom Croft, director of
quality assurance for the Department of Health and Human Services
Board of Health Professionals. ``They (the military) have got eight
years of practice tradition here they have to overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Mazzuchi said the Daily News series pushed the military to
develop a better health care system, one that protects the rights
of both doctors and patients.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in March, hospitals were required to post report cards
in the hospitals and on the Internet. A sample report provided by
Mazzuchi showed that the patients were more satisfied and the staff
more qualified at Martin Army Community Hospital compared to the
average civilian hospital. The Army hospital, according to the
document provided by Mazzuchi, received an overall score of 98 out
of 100, compared to a civilian average of 92.
</P>
<P>
   The services also formed patient advisory groups at every
hospital, Mazzuchi said. The groups will be made up of mostly
enlisted personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did this not only to help address quality problems...We're
concerned about attitude, waiting time,'' Mazzuchi said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, and U.S. Rep. David Hobson,
R-Ohio, said the changes, which they helped implement, will improve
the quality of health care for military families.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am encouraged by the steps the military has taken as a
direct result of our congressional hearings and the media interest
in this issue,'' Hobson said. ``This was a top priority for me this
year, and if we save one military family the unnecessary trauma and
heartache of a poorly performed medical procedure it will have been
well worth the effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Hobson said the defense budget includes $5 million for the
development of identification tags containing a computer chip that
includes a service member's medical records. The Army proposed the
idea some time ago, Hobson said, but revived it in response to the
newspaper series, which reported problems with lost medical files.
</P>
<P>
   Both DeWine and Hobson agreed that more may have to be done.
</P>
<P>
   DeWine said he wants to wait on a report from a special Blue
Ribbon committee, which is due in December, before deciding on
additional changes. He said he would consider making the military
legally bound _ as civilians are _ to report to the National
Practitioner Data Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's an area we need to look at,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   DeWine also said he would consider giving military members the
right to sue the government in medical malpractice cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how you morally justify making people in the
military second-class citizens: not being able to file lawsuits
other citizens can file,'' DeWine said. ``We should look to protect
those in the military. They are the ones who protect us.

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD, Calif. _ Edward Zwick was startled the other morning
to pick up The New York Times and read the headline: ``U.S. Sees a
Brooklyn Connection to International Terror Network.''
</P>
<P>
   Zwick, director of ``The Siege,'' about a state of emergency in
New York after a murderous campaign by Brooklyn-based terrorists,
said: ``It was this strange reaction. What was described was
upsetting and difficult. But there is some secret thrill in having
gotten it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Arab-American groups say the $70 million film, which opens
Nov. 6, has not got it right. One of them, the American-Arab
Anti-Discrimination Committee, said last week that the film
perpetuated anti-Arab stereotypes and was ``insidious, dangerous
and incendiary.'' Zwick (above), a creator of the television series
``Thirtysomething'' and director of ``Glory,'' ``Legends of the
Fall'' and ``Courage Under Fire'' voiced surprise and unhappiness
at the comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret that the film should be understood so narrowly,'' the
46-year-old director said. ``What is defamatory to Arab-Americans
is a small fanatic minority who use the words of the Koran in the
name of violence. This film tries to sympathetically describe the
predicament of a group of American citizens whose genuine Islamic
beliefs become a source of prejudice and repression when terrorism
comes to these shores.''
</P>
<P>
   The film stars Denzel Washington as the head of a joint FBI-New
York City police terrorism task force; Annette Bening as a CIA
operative with ambiguous ties to some terrorists, and Bruce Willis
as a gung-ho Army general who succeeds in imposing military order
on the city and interning thousands of Muslim men in a style
reminiscent of the internment of Japanese-Americans in World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   The internment issue, in some ways, most fascinated Zwick,
although the film has plenty of action, including tanks rumbling
over the Brooklyn Bridge and along Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can do a lot in Times Square between midnight and 4 a.m.
on Sunday night, Monday morning,'' Zwick said.
</P>
<P>
   He was offered the project by the producer Lynda Obst and helped
revise it from the story of an FBI-CIA conflict over how to deal
with a terrorist nuclear threat to New York to a drama about the
Army moving onto the streets of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a story to tell about our reaction to events, the
effect of terrorism on the social fabric in terms of law
enforcement, government, the media and the military,'' he said
</P>
<P>
   Zwick said he wanted to deal with the question of what would
happen in a city like New York if terrorism was unleashed in the
way that London, Beirut, Paris, Jerusalem and Tel Aviv have endured
bombings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have in this country a very unhappy tradition of
overreacting to perceived threats, all in the name of defending
freedom,'' said Zwick, who wrote the script with Lawrence Wright
and Menno Meyjes.
</P>
<P>
   Zwick spoke intensely about the criticism of the film. ``I
didn't invent the world: I'm an artist presuming to look at the
world and write about what I see and what I fear,'' he said.
``Irrational violence and prejudice and stereotyping and repression
are sad truths. And not to talk about them, to shrink from them,
because they're hurtful or politically sensitive or politically
incorrect is to deny one of the most important things I'm trying to
do, which is provoke thought and dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Father of `Frankenstein'
</P>
<P>
   In May 1957, the 67-year-old director James Whale committed
suicide in his swimming pool at his house in the Pacific Palisades.
Whale, the British-born director of ``Frankenstein'' (1931) and
``Bride of Frankenstein'' (1935), had watched his career slide,
largely because of poor health.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had this series of strokes and everything that was
important to him was taken away _ he couldn't paint, he couldn't
read, he couldn't entertain and, what's more, he realized it was
going to get worse and all he faced was pain and old age,'' said
Bill Condon, who has written and directed a new film, ``Gods and
Monsters,'' a speculative account of the final weeks of Whale.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which opens Nov. 4 and has already garnered critical
applause, stars Ian McKellen as Whale and Brendan Fraser as a
gardener who becomes friendly with him in his final days. It also
features Lynn Redgrave as Whale's formidable housekeeper.
</P>
<P>
   Condon, 42, has written for various film publications and
directed some low-budget horror movies himself. For years, he said,
he has been a fan of the Frankenstein films.
</P>
<P>
   ``These films are as fresh today as when they were made and bear
his impact so strongly,'' Condon said. ``There's this combination
of macabre wit and wonderful style, and there's always this real
identification on his part with the outcast in society, the
outsider.''
</P>
<P>
   The film is adapted from a novel by Christopher Bram, ``Father
of Frankenstein,'' that was loosely based on Whale's life. The
filmmaker, who was one of Hollywood's most distinctive, but now
largely unknown, directors, was openly gay and had friendships with
many famous Hollywood figures, from director George Cukor to Boris
Karloff and Elsa Lancaster.
</P>
<P>
   As a relative unknown, Condon struggled to get the film made.
Clive Barker, the noted creator of horror films, agreed to be
executive producer, which helped. But the turning point for Condon
came when McKellen, one of the most acclaimed British actors,
signed on.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hadn't really heard of Whale, he had never seen the movies
but when he did he was delighted to discover how clever and camp
they were,'' Condon said.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Other actors will attach themselves to a project but
say, `Call me when you get the money.' Ian actually allowed himself
to be trotted out to meet investors when we were raising money.''
The film cost about $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   According to production notes, McKellen said he took the part
because he identified closely with the Whale character.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here was that most alluring of things for a British actor _ an
English part, set in Hollywood, surrounded by American actors,'' he
said. ``It had the added attraction for me of Whale's also being
gay and from the same part of England.''
</P>
<P>
   Condon believes that Whale's grim early life in northern England
and especially his years as a soldier in the trenches of World War
I led to the images that created the Frankenstein films.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medical advances in World War I allowed maimed men to survive,
and suddenly people were surrounded by grotesque figures, reminders
of this terrible war,'' Condon said. ``Whale himself spent two
years in the trenches and a long time in a POW camp. The monstrous
images so famous in his movies and his sense of ironic detachment
arose from his personal experiences in the war.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Mr. `Pleasantville'
</P>
<P>
   Gary Ross is 42, so he barely remembers the 1950s. But the
writer-director of ``Pleasantville,'' which was No. 1 at the box
office this week, has, in recent years, been consumed with the
straitlaced, Eisenhower, ``Father Knows Best'' era.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be an incredible longing for that era,'' said
Ross (above), who wrote ``Dave'' and co-authored ``Big.'' ``People
are nostalgic for something I didn't feel was real. They sanitized
this memory. They created a kind of perfection out of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The film is a kind of modern fairy tale in which twin siblings
from a broken '90s family find themselves trapped in a '50s
suburban sitcom utopia, filmed in black and white, where the
thermometer always reads 72, everyone is polite, sex doesn't exist
and basketballs always go in the hoop.
</P>
<P>
   ``My initial idea was to ask what would happen if there was a
place where there was no color, noise, doubt or uncertainty,'' Ross
said.
</P>
<P>
   Conflicts surface in the town of Pleasantville between those
daring to experience life's pleasures and absurdities _ marked by
the characters turning technicolor _ and those wanting to retain
the status quo, who remain in black and white. Ross said the
``repressed wholesomeness'' of an Ozzie and Harriet universe is
just as bankrupt, maybe even more so, than the turbulence of life
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day it's a movie that embraces ambiguity and
uncertainty _ and what's gratifying is to see people respond so
emotionally to it,'' Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which stars William Macy, Joan Allen, Tobey Maguire
and Reese Witherspoon, drew a mixed crowd of moviegoers last
weekend, leaning toward the older side.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch Goldman, New Line Cinema's marketing and distribution
chief, said 30 percent of the audience was 40 and over, although
the film drew a considerable younger crowd.

POLL SHOWS BOXER TAKING LEAD IN CALIFORNIA SENATE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Filed in ``a'' and ``p'' categories.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sen. Barbara Boxer has moved from the apparent
underdog to front-runner in her hard-fought race for re-election,
according to a poll released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The new Field Poll shows the Democratic incumbent taking a
9-percentage-point lead over state Treasurer Matt Fong. A similar
poll just three weeks ago showed Boxer trailing by 4 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts said the turnaround is largely a result of
Boxer's aggressive television advertising, which has sought to
portray her Republican challenger as an extremist on issues such as
the environment, abortion and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Fong spokesman Steve Schmidt said the new poll numbers were out
of step with other recent data showing the race was in a
statistical dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Barbara Boxer believes she's nine points ahead she should
take down her misleading, negative, distorted advertising,''
Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer was doing just the opposite _ releasing a new television
commercial Wednesday that combines elements of her other recent
negative ads.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-second spot targets Fong's opposition to a ban on assault
weapons and Saturday-night specials, his position on limiting
malpractice awards against health maintenance organizations and his
support for a nuclear waste dump in Ward Valley in the Mojave
Desert.
</P>
<P>
   While Fong has criticized Boxer's commercials as misleading,
they appear to be succeeding in defining his somewhat fuzzy image
among voters.
</P>
<P>
   The new poll showed Boxer ahead 51 percent to 42 percent among
likely voters, with 7 percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
   The poll was conducted Oct. 22-27 among 1,102 people of whom 678
were identified as likely voters. It has a margin of error of plus
or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The shift in support toward Boxer could have several causes:
President Clinton's apparent popularity after the signing of a new
Middle East peace accord, the president's subsequent trip to
California to campaign for Boxer and the senator's own swings
across the state coupled with her well-publicized news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   But in a state where commercials long ago replaced press tours
as the primary form of political communication, Boxer seems to be
leading for one major reason: money.
</P>
<P>
   In the past month, Boxer has outspent Fong 2-1 on commercials
aimed at undermining his carefully-crafted image as a moderate
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements have left Fong reeling and criticizing his
opponent's negative tactics. But with less cash on hand, Fong has
had to focus less on public events and more on private fund-raisers
aimed at rebuilding his campaign fund.
</P>
<P>
   It is important for him to raise money, said Bruce Cain, acting
director of the Institute for Governmental Studies at the
University of California at Berkeley. ``He's getting creamed with
TV ads. My guess is he feels he needs the money to try to respond
to the barrage of TV ads.''
</P>
<P>
   Fong has responded with a new 30-second spot featuring his
mother, March Fong Eu, who served for 20 years as California's
secretary of state. The commercial, which began running Tuesday,
attacks Boxer for running a negative campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the former chief elections officer, and a Democrat, I'm
disappointed Barbara Boxer has run a campaign full of lies and
distortion,'' Fong Eu says in the commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ``These attacks are not true. She should be ashamed,'' Fong Eu
said. ``Please reject Barbara Boxer's negative campaign and support
Matt Fong.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer spokesman Roy Behr, who derided the commercial as Fong's
``mommy ad,'' pointed out that Fong Eu shares many of Boxer's views
on such issues as abortion, gun control and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is understandable that a mother would come to the aid of
her son, but on the issues voters are looking at, she agrees with
Barbara Boxer, not Matt Fong,'' Behr said.

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sen. Barbara Boxer has moved from the apparent
underdog to front-runner in her hard-fought race for re-election,
according to a poll released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The new Field Poll shows the Democratic incumbent taking a
9-percentage-point lead over state Treasurer Matt Fong. A similar
poll just three weeks ago showed Boxer trailing by 4 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts said the turnaround is largely a result of
Boxer's aggressive television advertising, which has sought to
portray her Republican challenger as an extremist on issues such as
the environment, abortion and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Fong spokesman Steve Schmidt said the new poll numbers were out
of step with other recent data showing the race was in a
statistical dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Barbara Boxer believes she's nine points ahead she should
take down her misleading, negative, distorted advertising,''
Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer was doing just the opposite _ releasing a new television
commercial Wednesday that combines elements of her other recent
negative ads.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-second spot targets Fong's opposition to a ban on assault
weapons and Saturday-night specials, his position on limiting
malpractice awards against health maintenance organizations and his
support for a nuclear waste dump in Ward Valley in the Mojave
Desert.
</P>
<P>
   While Fong has criticized Boxer's commercials as misleading,
they appear to be succeeding in defining his somewhat fuzzy image
among voters.
</P>
<P>
   The new poll showed Boxer ahead 51 percent to 42 percent among
likely voters, with 7 percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
   The poll was conducted Oct. 22-27 among 1,102 people of whom 678
were identified as likely voters. It has a margin of error of plus
or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The shift in support toward Boxer could have several causes:
President Clinton's apparent popularity after the signing of a new
Middle East peace accord, the president's subsequent trip to
California to campaign for Boxer and the senator's own swings
across the state coupled with her well-publicized news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   But in a state where commercials long ago replaced press tours
as the primary form of political communication, Boxer seems to be
leading for one major reason: money.
</P>
<P>
   In the past month, Boxer has outspent Fong 2-1 on commercials
aimed at undermining his carefully-crafted image as a moderate
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements have left Fong reeling and criticizing his
opponent's negative tactics. But with less cash on hand, Fong has
had to focus less on public events and more on private fund-raisers
aimed at rebuilding his campaign fund.
</P>
<P>
   It is important for him to raise money, said Bruce Cain, acting
director of the Institute for Governmental Studies at the
University of California at Berkeley. ``He's getting creamed with
TV ads. My guess is he feels he needs the money to try to respond
to the barrage of TV ads.''
</P>
<P>
   Fong has responded with a new 30-second spot featuring his
mother, March Fong Eu, who served for 20 years as California's
secretary of state. The commercial, which began running Tuesday,
attacks Boxer for running a negative campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the former chief elections officer, and a Democrat, I'm
disappointed Barbara Boxer has run a campaign full of lies and
distortion,'' Fong Eu says in the commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ``These attacks are not true. She should be ashamed,'' Fong Eu
said. ``Please reject Barbara Boxer's negative campaign and support
Matt Fong.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer spokesman Roy Behr, who derided the commercial as Fong's
``mommy ad,'' pointed out that Fong Eu shares many of Boxer's views
on such issues as abortion, gun control and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is understandable that a mother would come to the aid of
her son, but on the issues voters are looking at, she agrees with
Barbara Boxer, not Matt Fong,'' Behr said.

   UNDATED _ This is about dreams and the human spirit. It is about
looking to the stars and wanting to touch them, rather than pull
them down. The sour-grapers call it a publicity stunt or a
political payback. So what? The defenders try to justify it as
science. Big deal. They all miss the point and the beauty of the
moment. On Thursday, John Glenn, the man who rode an Atlas rocket
into orbit on Feb. 20, 1962, restored our nation's pride and our
belief in heroes. He did it with the humility and the courage that
embody this country's ideals, once again reaching for the stars for
the sheer thrill of it. Glenn did this at age 77. He is two years
older than my father. Why do we need to debate and analyze? For one
day, after a far-to-long 36-year wait, this country stopped, just
as in 1962. We had a common uplifting bond _ if even for a few
fleeting minutes _ before returning to cell phones, faxes and

arithmetic of school vouchers given to me by advocates of a pilot
voucher program for Texas, I can't get it through my admittedly
thick skull how the majority of Texas schoolchildren will benefit

``Cool.'' Then, after about 10 minutes, the novelty wears off and
you realize that you have to put up with dialogue in this puzzler
about six strangers trapped in a mazelike prison made up of cubic

<P>
   NEW YORK _ For a place as wildly diverse as New York, the city's
major commercial theater can often seem considerably less so. Sure,
``The Beauty Queen of Leenane'' is an Irish play, and ``Art'' is
French. The list, and the world, seem pretty much to end right
there.
</P>
<P>
   But while Broadway's idea of exotic fare may be a West End
import, in neighborhoods throughout the city, smaller nonprofit
theaters are serving up a feast of original work, seldom-seen plays
and new translations from a wide variety of ethnic backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   On any given night, an intrepid theatergoer might encounter a
reading of new German plays, a modern romantic comedy performed in
Yiddish or a Bengali-language production of Arthur Miller's ``View
From the Bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   This weekend is no exception. Friday night, for example, at
Repertorio Espanol, on East 27th Street in Manhattan, audiences can
see one of the first American performances of ``She Looks White
(Parece Blanca)'' by Aberlardo Estorino, a Cuban playwright. It is
being performed by a company of eight Cuban actors allowed into the
United States through an exchange program between the theater and
the Cuban authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Across town Friday night, on West 22nd Street, the Irish
Repertory Theater is offering the first preview of ``The Shaughraun
(The Vagabond),'' a 19th-century comedy by Dion Boucicault
advertised as involving ``swashbuckling swordplay, lots of kissing
and a dog.''
</P>
<P>
   And uptown, on Theater Row, the Intar Center for the Hispanic
Arts just began a two-month festival of the works of Frederico
Garcia Lorca, considered Spain's greatest playwright. It includes a
pair of rarely produced works, ``The Shoemaker's Prodigious Wife,''
a 1929 farce, and ``As Five Years Pass,'' his Dali-inspired
experiment with Surrealism.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the fare has a political edge. On Sunday, the Jewish
Repertory opens its 25th season with a revival of ``Kuni-Leml,'' a
1984 musical based on an 1880 play about an arranged Hasidic
marriage and a young woman's rebellion against it. And at the New
Federal Theater, the city's oldest professional black company, the
current production is ``The Trial of One Short-Sighted Black Woman
vs. Mammy Louise and Safreeta Mae,'' a satire described by the
playwright, Marcia L. Leslie, as ``what Aunt Jemima would say if
she popped off the pancake box.''
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the city is home to more than 30 so-called ethnic
theater companies, a loose term for troupes that devote their
efforts to producing plays from and fostering appreciation for a
specific cultural heritage. They range from established veterans
like Repertorio Espanol and the Irish Repertory, both with annual
budgets of more than $1 million, to young experimental troupes like
the Slant Performance Group, a trio of Asian-American performers
whose rock-infused presentations include satirical show stoppers
like ``Secret Asian Man,'' and ``The Buddha Blues.''
</P>
<P>
   And unlike the Broadway and Off Broadway houses, these theaters
span the city, from Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, where troupes made up
of recent Russian immigrants are beginning to form, to the Bronx,
where longstanding Irish and Italian communities have their own
local companies.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at some of the groups that add spice to the city's
theatrical melting pot. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the home of hundreds of thousands of Dominicans, Cubans,
Puerto Ricans, Mexicans and other Latin Americans, the city has
encouraged a vibrant Hispanic theater scene, with older companies
like Intar, the Puerto Rican Traveling Theater and Repertorio
Espanol, all founded in the late 1960s, and smaller new troupes.
</P>
<P>
   The Repertorio, started in 1968, is perhaps the most active
ethnic theater in New York. Its resident actors sometimes perform
as many as five different shows in a week. Next weekend, they will
perform ``La Gringa,'' a play by Carmen Rivera, on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, it's ``Yerma,'' by Garcia Lorca, and ``She Looks
White,'' and then on Sunday, the Cuban play ``Strawberry and
Chocolate.'' All performances are in Spanish with simultaneous
English translation by an offstage actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to America feeling I had a duty to bring to life one of
the world's great bodies of work,'' said Rene Buch, the company's
Cuban-born artistic director. He added with a laugh, ``And I'm
still at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Buch, 70, also seems intent on exporting the company's work;
this year the troupe traveled to Havana to perform Eduardo
Machado's ``Broken Eggs.'' The actors were the first Americans to
appear onstage in Cuba in nearly 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at Intar, founded in 1966, Max Ferra, the artistic
director, has been organizing an ambitious program of performances
and lectures to commemorate the centennial of the birth of Garcia
Lorca, who was killed by Franco's soldiers in 1936. The festival
began on Wednesday and runs through Dec. 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's always talking about Lorca, Lorca, Lorca,'' Ferra
said. ``But it's funny: almost nobody's seen much of his work.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Puerto Rican Traveling Company, founded in 1967, will
not present a new show until the spring, the Pregones Theater,
established in 1979 in the South Bronx, will present ``San Miguel,
Amarra tu Perro!'' in late November.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the Thalia Spanish Theater in Sunnyside, Queens,
which performs in Spanish, as Repertorio does. The company's next
production is ``The Fanlights,'' by the Puerto Rican playwright
Rene Marques, which it will present with another Manhattan company,
Teatro Circulo. The play, dealing with three sisters (not
Chekhov's), opens on Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The younger troupes include the Teatro Experimental Blue Amigos,
which opens a trio of short plays next Friday. It will be
performing in the basement of the Ecuadorean community Center in
Long Island City. And on the Lower East Side, three Hispanic
companies _ La Tea, the Milagro Theater Company and Vaso de Leche
Productions _ perform at the Clemente Soto Velez Cultural Center,
housed in a turn-of-the-century schoolhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night you can catch two shows there, ``Cimarron II,'' a
collection of Afro-Caribbean scenes and songs presented by La Tea,
and ``Shophell,'' a mystery by the Puerto Rican playwright Jesse
Mojica produced by Vaso de Leche. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like the Hispanic troupes, Asian-American companies include
actors, writers and directors from a number of countries. Different
performance traditions influence each company, from the meditative
grace of Japan's Noh theater to the frenetic, balletic stick
fighting of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Pan Asian Repertory is the oldest of the companies, founded by
Tisha Chang in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Asian community was one of the last to regard the
theater as a respectable or legitimate profession,'' Ms. Chang
said. ``It's not so bad now, but 25 years ago it was a few very
brave people doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   Pan Asian's next show, ``Carry the Tiger to the Mountain,''
opens on Nov. 12. It tells the story of Vincent Chen, a Detroit
resident beaten to death by two unemployed auto workers in 1982.
The title comes from a move in tai-chi.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chang said the Chen case had special resonance in light of
the recent brutal slaying of Matthew Shepard, a gay University of
Wyoming student. ``It shows, unfortunately, how very relevant it
is,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There are also three young companies at work in the city: the
Slant Performance Group, the National Asian-American Theater
Company and Ma-Yi, a Filipino-American troupe.
</P>
<P>
   The National Asian-American Theater Company, which was started
in an East Village basement, emerged in July with a well-received
production of ``Falsettoland,'' an Asian take on William Finn's
musical of Jewish angst. The group's next show, in February, will
also be a revival, this time of a pair of little-performed Brecht
plays.
</P>
<P>
   Ma-Yi, too, is not producing till next spring, but Slant is
working on its new show, ``Hotel California,'' which deals with a
1977 incident in which hundreds of elderly Filipinos were evicted
from a low-income residential hotel in San Francisco. The show
opens on Nov. 19.
</P>
<P>
   The group, which mixes rock music, dance and comedy skits in its
performance, was started in 1995 by Wayland Quintero, Richard
Ebihara and Perry Yung and has since won critical praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slant must be incapable of dullness,'' D.J.R. Bruckner wrote
in The New York Times in 1996. ``No matter how much fun they poke
at other people, they laugh at themselves more.''
</P>
<P>
   New York has been flush with imported Irish theater, from
Broadway's ``Beauty Queen'' and Off Broadway's ``Night in
November'' to the agitprop vehicle ``Binlids,'' which just
completed a very noisy run at the Angel Orensanz Foundation in the
Lower East Side.
</P>
<P>
   But the city's own Irish theaters have also been active. The
Irish Repertory, celebrating its 10th year, has settled into the
theater it built on the site of a chemical factory on West 22nd
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Besides ``The Shraughraun,'' on the main stage this week, the
troupe will open ``Krapp's Last Tape'' by Samuel Beckett in the
60-seat basement studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are absolutely mad,'' said Charlotte Moore, the theater's
artistic director. ``Beckett in the basement and farce upstairs.
Can you imagine the crowd?''
</P>
<P>
   The Irish Arts Center has also been busy, producing ``Binlids''
downtown and ``Moonshine,'' by Jim Nolan, which closes Saturday at
its performance space on West 51st Street.
</P>
<P>
   Much lower-budget is the three-year-old Macalla Theater Company,
formed by Irish expatriates in Woodlawn, the Bronx, a longtime
Irish neighborhood. The group, which is presenting the play
``Paddywack'' through Nov. 16, makes its home in the basement of
the Korean-American Presbyterian Church on a quiet residential
street.
</P>
<P>
   While Macalla's goals are modest _ its mission statement
includes a desire to ``break the endless cycle of bar hopping'' in
the neighborhood _ it has touched a nerve. At a performance on
Saturday night, the audience applauded between scenes and lingered
long after to discuss the play, which deals with racism by and
against the Irish.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put it on at home, it's a bit old hat,'' said Eamonn
Dornan, the group's president, who was born in County Down. ``But
when you bring it to the Bronx, where each neighboring community is
a different ethnic group, it hits home.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Bronx company working in a traditional enclave is the
Belmont Italian-American Playhouse, on Arthur Avenue in the heart
of the borough's Little Italy. The group, founded in 1991,
concentrates on modern Italian-American writers and classic Italian
drama, including commedia dell'arte and works like ``La
Madragola,'' by Niccolo Machiavelli. Its next show, ``Rockaway
Boulevard,'' opens on Nov. 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to try to change some stereotypes,'' said Dante
Alberti, the artistic director. ``We wanted to show that there's
Italian characters other than just mafia hoods.''

<P>
   This election season in America is not like others. It is a
season of mists and fogs, haunted by the Halloween specters of
Kenneth Starr, Monica Lewinsky, Bill Clinton and Henry Hyde, the
chairman of the committee that must decide, in the next few months,
whether the president should be impeached or not.
</P>
<P>
   Mounds of tawdry evidence lie thickly in the gutters. From both
the White House and Congress comes the rattle of skeletons in
cupboards. The drooling wolves of the press lope through the murk
and every so often, as a pack, raise their muzzles to the moon and
howl.
</P>
<P>
   Such a scene, now richly topical, has been playing in America
for most of this year. Yet how it will play next week is a mystery.
On Nov. 3 Americans will go to the polls to elect the House of
Representatives and a third of the Senate. It is a process that is
both local and, at times, astonishingly national: where races are
sometimes decided on the strength of a highway or a waste site and,
at other times, by countrywide tides of hatred or disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Both in 1994 (the last Republican landslide) and in 1974 (the
Democratic landslide after Watergate) pundits and politicians alike
were surprised to see discontent with the White House translated
into routs in Congress. This year, at various exceptionally seamy
points in the saga of Bill and Monica, there have been predictions
that the same thing will happen again: the Republicans will bolster
their thin margin of seats in the Senate and their wafer-thin
margin in the House, while the Democrats will be slaughtered.
</P>
<P>
   But that is far from certain now, in this season of
inappropriate ghosts and legally-accurate ghouls.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the president and his woes, there are no issues
around to speak of. The economy is beginning to stumble, but not
yet so badly as to sour the general contentment; crime is falling;
the budget is balanced, more or less.
</P>
<P>
   Those issues that remain contentious -- Social Security reform,
the state of health care and the schools, campaign-finance reform
-- are hardly partisan, since neither party has worked out how to
tackle them or even seems to care much.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves two areas of voter interest: the very local, and
Lewinsky, Starr and all their works. This election, many pundits
assume, will therefore turn into a referendum on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Lewinsky affair has not been playing as expected. At
first, Republican candidates seized on it, while Democrats fled
from it and from the president in person. Then both sides thought
again. Overwhelmingly, their constituents were telling them that
they did not care. The scandal was all about sex; if Clinton lied,
so would anyone have done; Starr was vindictive, and the
Republicans in Congress were merely out to get the president.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Clinton was sleazy and untrustworthy; but voters had voted
for him, he was doing a fine job, and it was time to leave him
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, the scandal has been all but invisible on the
campaign trail. The Republicans have waited until now, the last
week of the campaign, to launch a $10-million attack on the
president's behavior. Even so, it is a strategy fraught with risk,
for every time the Republicans have seemed to be milking the
scandal politically, it has backfired on them.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, do they continue? Mostly because they cannot believe
that the scandal is not more of an issue, and that there is not
some deep vein of public disgust still to be discovered and
exploited. For the press, the pundits and many politicians, it
remains the chief subject in town.
</P>
<P>
   A great divide has opened up between the American people and
those who feel they should shape the way the American people think.
</P>
<P>
   Part of this stems from a more painful sense of betrayal among
those who thought they were close to the president. Some of it is
local to Washington: this town's pundits feel soiled by Clinton's
activities in a way that the ordinary voters of Cleveland or Dallas
do not. The press in particular -- best to be honest about it --
has a keen appetite for political upset, whereas the mass of the
country prefers a quiet life.
</P>
<P>
   But these groups, despite their failings, may also have a better
knowledge of how political power works in the finer details, and
how hard it is to govern a country without trust, or when
constantly distracted.
</P>
<P>
   This peculiar tension, immovable object and irresistible force,
is unlikely to change before Election Day. Yet much of that popular
feeling may fail to show up at the polls. Turnout as usual will be
abysmally low, at around 30-35 percent. The lower the turnout, the
better for the Republicans, since religious conservatives are the
most motivated to vote; but voters will most likely stick to old
habits, returning a legislature much like the previous one. Poll
after poll has shown that Congress is deeply unpopular for having
launched the impeachment inquiry. Yet faced with the men and women
who bring home the pork, voters almost always re-elect them.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, Clinton's poll ratings have been steadily high, even
rising, through this scandal; but, faced with the man who actually
lied to them, who shamed them and whose actions have proved
impossible to explain to their children, could Americans really be
moved to orchestrate a protest vote on his behalf? They are far
more likely to close the door on all these horrors, Clinton and
Starr and Hyde alike, refuse to venture out to vote, and continue
to block their ears to the howls of the press pack as it pads along
the street.

ARITHMETIC OF VOUCHERS NOT ADDING UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Blame it on my public school education, but it still doesn't add
up.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the painstaking explanations of the arithmetic of school
vouchers given to me by advocates of a pilot voucher program for
Texas, I can't get it through my admittedly thick skull how the
majority of Texas schoolchildren will benefit from subtracting
resources from the public schools to multiply private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I went through public schools before they started
teaching new math.
</P>
<P>
   Based upon the calculations of the voucher pushers, per-pupil
spending in the public schools would actually increase if tax
dollars were taken away from those schools to finance private
education.
</P>
<P>
   Their paradigm goes something like this:
</P>
<P>
   Take a school district with 1,000 students that has a budget of
$6 million and divide the 1,000 students into the $6 million, which
equals $6,000 per pupil.
</P>
<P>
   Subtract 100 students who opt for private schools, each taking a
voucher worth $4,500 (75 percent of the per-pupil cost) _ a total
of $450,000.
</P>
<P>
   Divide the remaining $5.5 million by the remaining 900 students,
and the resulting quotient is $6,166 per student.
</P>
<P>
   That hypothetical checks out arithmetically. But it doesn't pass
a reality check.
</P>
<P>
   The assumption is that everyone will win because the private
schools will get the support they need to be viable and the public
schools will have more money to spend on fewer students.
</P>
<P>
   Some important things, however, are left out of the equation.
Fewer students do not necessarily add up to reduced expenditures.
Certain fixed costs will remain, including maintenance and debt
service on capital improvements and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the inherent unfairness of taking disproportionate
amounts of locally raised property tax revenue _ money collected
for the purpose of supporting local public schools _ and
transferring it to the private sector. That would be taking
Robin-Hooding to another level of confiscation.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that are intangible perils. Private education would be
exalted as necessarily better than public education, and that would
trigger another exodus from the public schools _ a flight of the
best, brightest and most motivated.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of vouchers pooh-pooh that ``creaming'' objection to
vouchers. They argue that the best students and most motivated
parents already have exercised their educational choice by
enrolling in private schools or moving into communities and
neighborhoods with quality schools.
</P>
<P>
   That's a cynical argument. It suggests that there is not much
real brain power left in the inner cities. Nevertheless, voucher
supporters profess a mission to offer the ``at-risk'' students
there the opportunity to grow and develop in an atmosphere more
conducive to learning.
</P>
<P>
   They cite the successes of pilot voucher programs in such places
as Cleveland and Milwaukee as evidence of how inner-city children
can make significant academic gains by attending private schools.
</P>
<P>
   The voucher advocate's contention that competition will make the
public schools better would be easier to swallow if the competition
were self-generating. Instead, the Texas Legislature is being asked
to fork over tax dollars to support and create the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Although the vouchers advocates failed in the last session of
the Legislature, the issue will be back in 1999. The push will be
on again to establish pilot voucher programs in Austin, Dallas, El
Paso, Fort Worth, Houston and San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's a whale of a pilot program. These people are not
half-stepping. With their deceptive battle cry, ``Put the Children
First,'' they are intent upon giving parents and students of the
six largest urban school districts in Texas nothing less than the
choice to give up on public education.
</P>
<P>
   The ambitious Texas vouchers proposal adds up to a switchblade
pointed at the heart of public education in this state.

 NEW YORK: mafia hoods.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Ran Avni produced the Jewish Repertory Theater's first show
in 1974, the reaction was, well, mixed. ``People came and said it's
not Jewish, it's not repertory, and it's not theater,'' Avni said.
``Over the years, we got better.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, he said, the company focuses on ``plays that relate to
the Jewish experience,'' a wide mandate that allows for productions
as varied as Chekhov's ``Ivanov'' (with its beleaguered Jewish
heroine) and ``The Merchant of Venice'' (with its crude Jewish
villain).
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, the Jewish Rep opens ``Kuni-Leml,'' an
English-language musical adaptation of a play by Abraham Goldfadn
that apparently was an enormous hit in Kharkov, Russia, in 1880.
The piece was musicalized and became a hit for the Jewish Rep in
1984. (Talk about a long out-of-town run.)
</P>
<P>
   Goldfadn was one of the fathers of the Yiddish theater, which
had a large audience in the immigrant population of
turn-of-the-century New York. That heritage has faded; the only
remaining representative is the Folksbiene Yiddish Theater, now in
its 83rd year.
</P>
<P>
   But even the Folksbiene is changing. The theater's artistic
management turned over last summer, with Eleanor Reissa and Zalmen
Mlotek taking the reins. The next production, ``Zise Khaloymes,''
begins performances on Dec. 5, and though it is in Yiddish, it is a
considerable departure: an original, modern musical with a
multi-racial cast and musical help provided by Frank London of the
hipster klezmer group the Klezmatics. The show will also have
simultaneous English and Russian translations.
</P>
<P>
   Woodie King Jr., the founder of the New Federal Theater,
remembers when the black theater scene was so vibrant in New York
that the Black Theater Association, a trade group, had more than 60
dance and theater companies as members. ``Now, it's out of
business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The scarcity of black theater was a hot topic during last year's
much-ballyhooed debate at Town Hall between Robert Brustein, the
artistic director of the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge,
Mass., and August Wilson, the playwright. The debate touched on
everything from race-blind casting to segregation of black and
white theater companies.
</P>
<P>
   But while acclaimed troupes like the Negro Ensemble have folded,
the New Federal and several other black theaters remain. There's
the National Black Theater in Harlem, where a musical based on the
life of Tupac Shakur is playing, and the Billie Holiday Theater in
Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, which Thursday opened ``Rolling on
the TOBA,'' a musical about the black entertainment circuit in the
1920s and 30s.
</P>
<P>
   Farther afield are the Open Cage Theater in Mount Vernon, N.Y.,
where the actor Denzel Washington cut his teeth, and the Crossroads
Theater in New Brunswick, N.J., considered the nation's foremost
black theater company.
</P>
<P>
   The Open Cage has just moved into a new theater and will not
stage a new show until the spring, but Crossroads is presenting
Pearl Cleage's ``Blues For an Alabama Sky,'' which closes on
Sunday. The company's next show, ``It Ain't Nothing But the
Blues,'' a musical revue, begins on Nov. 18.
</P>
<P>
   While the Brustein-Wilson debate was generally considered a
disappointment, King says it has had some positive effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brought attention from foundations to the plight of black
theater,'' he said. ``They've opened up and are listening now.
That's all we've wanted, to be heard and seen.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   This election season in America is not like others. It is a
season of mists and fogs, haunted by the Halloween specters of
Kenneth Starr, Monica Lewinsky, Bill Clinton and Henry Hyde, the
chairman of the committee that must decide, in the next few months,
whether the president should be impeached or not.
</P>
<P>
   Mounds of tawdry evidence lie thickly in the gutters. From both
the White House and Congress comes the rattle of skeletons in
cupboards. The drooling wolves of the press lope through the murk
and every so often, as a pack, raise their muzzles to the moon and
howl.
</P>
<P>
   Such a scene, now richly topical, has been playing in America
for most of this year. Yet how it will play next week is a mystery.
On Nov. 3 Americans will go to the polls to elect the House of
Representatives and a third of the Senate. It is a process that is
both local and, at times, astonishingly national: where races are
sometimes decided on the strength of a highway or a waste site and,
at other times, by countrywide tides of hatred or disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Both in 1994 (the last Republican landslide) and in 1974 (the
Democratic landslide after Watergate) pundits and politicians alike
were surprised to see discontent with the White House translated
into routs in Congress. This year, at various exceptionally seamy
points in the saga of Bill and Monica, there have been predictions
that the same thing will happen again: the Republicans will bolster
their thin margin of seats in the Senate and their wafer-thin
margin in the House, while the Democrats will be slaughtered.
</P>
<P>
   But that is far from certain now, in this season of
inappropriate ghosts and legally-accurate ghouls.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the president and his woes, there are no issues
around to speak of. The economy is beginning to stumble, but not
yet so badly as to sour the general contentment; crime is falling;
the budget is balanced, more or less.
</P>
<P>
   Those issues that remain contentious -- Social Security reform,
the state of health care and the schools, campaign-finance reform
-- are hardly partisan, since neither party has worked out how to
tackle them or even seems to care much.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves two areas of voter interest: the very local, and
Lewinsky, Starr and all their works. This election, many pundits
assume, will therefore turn into a referendum on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Lewinsky affair has not been playing as expected. At
first, Republican candidates seized on it, while Democrats fled
from it and from the president in person. Then both sides thought
again. Overwhelmingly, their constituents were telling them that
they did not care. The scandal was all about sex; if Clinton lied,
so would anyone have done; Starr was vindictive, and the
Republicans in Congress were merely out to get the president.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Clinton was sleazy and untrustworthy; but voters had voted
for him, he was doing a fine job, and it was time to leave him
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, the scandal has been all but invisible on the
campaign trail. The Republicans have waited until now, the last
week of the campaign, to launch a $10-million attack on the
president's behavior. Even so, it is a strategy fraught with risk,
for every time the Republicans have seemed to be milking the
scandal politically, it has backfired on them.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, do they continue? Mostly because they cannot believe
that the scandal is not more of an issue, and that there is not
some deep vein of public disgust still to be discovered and
exploited. For the press, the pundits and many politicians, it
remains the chief subject in town.
</P>
<P>
   A great divide has opened up between the American people and
those who feel they should shape the way the American people think.
</P>
<P>
   Part of this stems from a more painful sense of betrayal among
those who thought they were close to the president. Some of it is
local to Washington: this town's pundits feel soiled by Clinton's
activities in a way that the ordinary voters of Cleveland or Dallas
do not. The press in particular -- best to be honest about it --

</P>

   But these groups, despite their failings, may also have a better
knowledge of how political power works in the finer details, and
how hard it is to govern a country without trust, or when
constantly distracted.
</P>

   This peculiar tension, immovable object and irresistible force,

GM'S NEW PICKUP CHALLENGES FORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Although it may not look it, the Chevrolet Silverado
is all new for '99. Replacing the C/K series, it's the pickup's
first significant revamping in 10 years, completely re-engineered
with upgraded engines, transmissions, steering, suspension,
interior, the lot.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Silverado is an exceptionally nice driving truck.
Handling, acceleration, comfort, build quality are all right up
there. It's the kind of pickup that explains succinctly why so many
people are abandoning their passenger cars for trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Stylistically, the body changes are subtle, looking not all that
different from the previous-generation C/K. Most significant is the
bigger, roomier cab, which includes larger windows and a restyled
dash. And in the extended-cab model, like the one I drove, there's
a real back seat that three regulation-size humans can occupy.
</P>
<P>
   Silverado, a longtime C/K label for its higher-end models, is
now the name for the whole line of pickups, a good move on Chevy's
part that better identifies and characterizes its trucks. GMC will
be selling the same pickup, with a few different contours, as the
Sierra.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors has a lot riding on the broad shoulders of the
Silverado. What's at stake is a run at the sales supremacy of the
Ford F-series pickup.
</P>
<P>
   GM has had enough of Ford being top dog on the sales charts year
after year for more than two decades, with the C/K pickup coming in
second each time.
</P>
<P>
   These are high stakes, too. In calendar year 1997, Ford F-series
trucks were the bestselling of any vehicle in the United States,
with about 750,000 of them chugging out of showrooms nationwide.
C/K was a distant second, with about 554,000 sold.
</P>
<P>
   Those are big, fat, serious num bers. And GM wants a bigger
piece of it.
</P>
<P>
   Silverado has the stuff to do it, as far as performance and
comfort go. But the decision to make the styling changes
evolutionary rather than revolutionary could come back to haunt
Chevy marketeers. Just take the booming success of the brawny Dodge
Ram, restyled a couple of years ago to look like a big hauler. It
brought Dodge trucks out of the cellar and onto the high road.
</P>
<P>
   Or Ford's muscular restyling of its F-series. People love the
look or hate the look, but Ford sells every one of these things
they can crank out. The Silverado, on the other hand, has a neutral
pleasantness that most people should approve of, but it's unlikely
to stir any passion in either direction.
</P>
<P>
   But no one should be dissatisfied with the driveability or
overall build quality of the Chevy. It's tight and rattle-free, due
to a stiffer frame and stronger body. It feels put together as well
as any German luxury car.
</P>
<P>
   The test truck came equipped with the Z71 off-road suspension
package, yet still provided a civilized ride on pavement. The firm
ride can be jouncy over bumps and heaves, but is never in any way
harsh or punishing to the people onboard. Cornering for this big
boy is smooth and balanced, even with the extra weight and
complexity of four-wheel drive.
</P>
<P>
   That drive system is one of the technological features that make
the Silverado stand out. As well as push-button engagement of
four-wheel-drive, including high and low range, the pickup came
equipped with optional AutoTrac, which leaves the truck in
rear-wheel drive until it detects wheel slippage, then engages the
front wheels as well.
</P>
<P>
   Exceptional stopping power is provided by four-wheel disc brakes
equipped with a standard anti-lock system. Power rack-and-pinion
steering is standard on two-wheel-drive models, though
four-wheel-drive trucks retain recirculating-ball steering for
added durability.
</P>
<P>
   There are five engine options, including three V-8s that share
architecture with the Corvette LT-1 engine. Each makes more power
than its C/K predecessor. There's also a 200-horse V-6, and a
6.5-liter turbo diesel that makes just 215 horsepower but a mighty
440 pound-feet of torque. Just the thing for those pulling chores,
like towing the Queen Mary.
</P>
<P>
   Our test truck had the middle level 5.3-liter V-8, which was
smooth and powerful, though not terribly impressive off the line.
Horsepower is up at the sacrifice of some low-end torque, proving
once again that there are no free rides.
</P>
<P>
   The tester had an 8,000-pound towing capacity behind its wide,
six-foot bed. It also had an optional four-speed automatic
transmission with a heavy-duty ``tow/haul'' feature for better
performance pulling heavy loads.
</P>
<P>
   A minor flaw in the body design is the three-door configuration
of the extended cab _ when the other makes are touting four-door
setups. This is no big deal, as far as I'm concerned, but the door
thing seems to be all the rage.
</P>
<P>
   At least with the new model, GM addressed a flaw in the old door
setup, providing an inside handle for back seat riders.
</P>
<P>
   The Silverado comes loaded with standard features, both in
convenience and advanced technology, and starts at about $15,355
for a base, two-wheel-drive model. Our test truck came heavily
optioned, pushing up the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Motor Trend has picked the Silverado as its Truck of the Year,
but that's kind of a no-brainer. It's a good machine that raises
the bar in truck sophistication, though it does nothing special in
the styling department. &QL;

 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Time flies. Remember you must die.
</P>
<P>
   It's a long way from being told to have a nice day, but those
words are carved in stone, a few steps from busy Tremont Street.
</P>
<P>
   The phrases are actually in Latin (``Fugit hora, memento
mori''), but their meaning is vividly clear by what appears beneath
them, a carving of Father Time with an hourglass and a skeleton
with an arrow, both reaching to snuff out a candle.
</P>
<P>
   The scene turns up a few times on the gravestones in King's
Chapel Burying Ground, Boston's oldest graveyard, which I recently
visited on a tour of historic graveyards in and around Boston.
</P>
<P>
   That may seem a spooky way to pass the time. But one can just as
easily argue that such places offer as rich an opportunity to
connect with the past as do famous houses or battlefields.
</P>
<P>
   As the scene at King's Chapel indicates, old graveyards can be
remarkable artistically, full of the cultural symbolism of an
earlier era, like the winged skulls on so many colonial headstones
or the delicately etched urns and weeping willows popular in the
early 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Gravestones have been the subject of academic treatises and even
guidebooks. Many years ago, on a whim, I picked up a small
paperback, ``New England Cemeteries,'' by Andrew Kull, which lists
scores of older graveyards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that if people take the time to look, they'll be
amazed what they can discover in a burying ground,'' said Laurel K.
Gabel, research coordinator for the Association for Gravestone
Studies, a nonprofit, membership organization that publishes a
scholarly journal on gravestones.
</P>
<P>
   She compared old burying grounds to outdoor museums,
repositories of folk art and sculpture, genealogical information,
even evidence of the language of earlier eras.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tell us a lot about our ancestors and the world they
lived in,'' Ms. Gabel said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   There is also an intimacy that comes from reading epitaphs of
early Americans, which can be ennobling, poignant or chilling.
</P>
<P>
   At Concord's Old Hill Burying Ground, there is inspiration in
the sturdy slate that marks the grave of Col. John Buttrick, who
led the colonial militiamen who engaged the British at the town's
North Bridge on April 19, 1775.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did he survive the Revolution, but, the stone declares,
``Having laid down the sword with honor, he resumed the plough with
industry; by the latter to maintain what the former had won.''
</P>
<P>
   Or one can be haunted by the memorial to the Rev. Charles T.
Torrey in Cambridge's Mount Auburn Cemetery. A Yale graduate, he
was arrested in Baltimore for helping slaves to freedom and died of
tuberculosis in the penitentiary in 1846. Engraved on a white
obelisk are some of his last words: ``It is better to die in prison
with the peace of God in our breasts than to live in freedom with a
polluted conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   I began my tour in Boston, where three old burying grounds lie
an easy walk from one another. On Tremont Street, near Boston
Common, is the site of both King's Chapel Burying Ground and the
Old Granary Burying Ground, which hummed with tourists the day I
visited.
</P>
<P>
   They were enticed most likely by its central location and the
all-star roster of patriots _ Paul Revere, John Hancock, Samuel
Adams _ interred there.
</P>
<P>
   Modern plaques lie among the gravestones, explaining how the
carvers first sketched the slates with chalk or ink, then cut them
with an awl or chisel.
</P>
<P>
   One plaque provides the name of a carver, Henry Christian Geyer,
who came from a family of fishermen and also made plaster of Paris
models of dogs, cats and royalty. (About 300 gravestone carvers who
worked before the year 1800 have been identified, said Ms. Gabel,
co-author of two books on the subject.)
</P>
<P>
   Historical information can also be found down the street in
King's Chapel Burying Ground, resting place of John Winthrop, first
governor of Massachusetts Bay Colony; Mary Chilton, the first woman
to step off the Mayflower, and William Dawes, who rode to warn
people of the British march to Concord on the same night as Revere.
</P>
<P>
   King's Chapel itself is a gray, stone building with Doric
columns. Begun as an Anglican church in 1717, it houses a
Unitarian-Universalist congregation. A sign inside says 30,000
sermons have been preached from its pulpit.
</P>
<P>
   Although I grew up in Boston's suburbs, there are parts of the
city I feel uncomfortable navigating without a map, such is the
configuration of the streets.
</P>
<P>
   I took one along to find Copp's Hill Burying Ground in the North
End, near Christ Church, more famously known as Old North.
</P>
<P>
   At Copp's Hill, I had the good fortune to encounter a highly
knowledgeable guide, dressed in period costume, meticulously acting
the part of a late-18th-century Bostonian. She gave her name as
Mistress Elizabeth de la Rue, spoke in detail about the burying
ground and guided a few of us among its more notable graves,
including that of the Rev. Cotton Mather, the Puritan minister and
scholar.
</P>
<P>
   Mistress Elizabeth never broke character, so it was only later
that I learned that although the name belonged to a real Bostonian
of that era, she is largely the creation of Donna La Rue, a
doctoral student at Boston University, who has been giving tours of
local burial grounds since 1991 (between July 4 and Labor Day
only), sponsored by the city's Parks and Recreation Department.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. La Rue said she had done research on burying grounds in
Boston, Cambridge and Salem, and values the older gravestones for
their combination of iconography and text.

<P>
   JERUSALEM -- Ominous cries of ``Bibi - traitor!'' heard at
demonstrations in Israel this week have rightly rattled the Shin
Bet security service. Nov. 4 will mark the third anniversary of the
assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, who was killed for launching the
peace process between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Now Benjamin Netanyahu, reluctantly and after two-and-a-half
years of feints and delays, has endorsed the principle of
land-for-peace that underlies the Oslo peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is my partner now,'' said Yasser Arafat last Sunday, ``like
Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres.''
</P>
<P>
   The stormy outpourings of the far right illustrate the change
that the prime minister has wrought in Israel's political
alignments. The terms right and left had long ceased to distinguish
adequately between the populist Likud and the largely middle-class
Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
   Now the overworked ornithology of hawk and dove may have to be
discarded too. To the settlers and their political hinterland,
Netanyahu has become more contemptible than the most cooing dove.
``I'd rather have Ehud Barak,'' says Yisrael Harel, a settler
ideologue, referring to Labor's leader. ``At least he talks
straight.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Barak is finding it difficult to talk straight. He is
torn between Labor's support for the Wye memorandum, which
Netanyahu and Arafat signed on Oct. 23, and the party's temptation
to make common cause with hardline coalition renegades in order to
topple the government.
</P>
<P>
   The polls show unambiguous public backing for the accord. So
Barak is offering a safety-net for the government in the Knesset
during the three-month implementation period. But, confusingly, he
still insists that Netanyahu is a national disaster and must go.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu is plainly uncomfortable, personally and politically,
with the new, centrist profile that the Wye agreement has conferred
on him. Although he needs middle-of-the-road support if he is to
retain the prime ministership, he cannot afford to lose too much of
the far right.
</P>
<P>
   The settlers and the Hasidic Lubavitch sect were his most ardent
campaigners in the 1996 election. Now they are planning to put up a
candidate of their own from among the coalition defectors. The
prime minister argues that he is the far right's best option: Labor
would have ceded far more than the 13.1 percent of the West Bank
that he signed away at Wye.
</P>
<P>
   But the disillusionment of true believers -- many on the far
right are religious extremists -- is not necessarily susceptible to
the logic of political expediency.
</P>
<P>
   In his effort to woo back would-be defectors, Netanyahu is
ducking and weaving for all he is worth. He postponed a scheduled
Thursday cabinet meeting that was to have debated the Wye
memorandum, on the ground that the Palestinians had not yet
conveyed to the Americans their ``security work plan'' to fight
terrorism (under the terms of the memorandum, they have until next
week to do so). There is no definitive map, yet, of the proposed
Israeli withdrawals because Netanyahu still wants to haggle with
the settlers over the precise lines.
</P>
<P>
   But President Bill Clinton's long days and nights at Wye
produced a detailed implementation program that the two sides will
be hard put to wriggle out of. Above all, the agreement provides
for the intimate and intrusive involvement of the CIA in monitoring
action against terrorism. An American-Palestinian committee will
meet every two weeks ``to review the steps being taken to eliminate
terrorist cells.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a trilateral high-ranking committee will meet ``not
less than bi-weekly to assess current threats, deal with any
impediments to effective security cooperation and coordination and
address the steps being taken to combat terror.''
</P>
<P>
   This makes America rather than Israel the arbiter of what
constitutes a terrorist threat and what measures are effective to
counter it. The Palestinians will need to convince American agents
on the ground that they are keeping Islamic fundamentalist groups
under tight control, despite the political discomfort this will
cause Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, America ``has agreed to assist'' the Palestinians in
confiscating illegal weapons; a trilateral committee will monitor
``cases of possible incitement''; and America will be ``briefed''
on which Palestinian policemen will serve in the Palestinian force.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also used the device of direct American involvement to
break an impasse over Netanyahu's demand that the Palestine
National Council, the unwieldy parliament-in-exile, should formally
revoke clauses in the 1964 Palestine National Covenant that call
for Israel's destruction. Members of the PNC are to be invited to a
grand assembly in Gaza, midway through the implementation period,
where they will be addressed by Clinton and ``reaffirm their
support for the peace process'' and for various previous
pronouncements nullifying the offensive clauses.
</P>
<P>
   It is not exactly what Netanyahu had wanted, but he apparently
could not reject Clinton's offer to make good, with his presence at
the convocation, for the constitutional imperfections in the
procedure. Arafat was reluctant to pledge a formal revocation by
the PNC, lest he failed to get the needed two-thirds majority.
</P>
<P>
   On another sticking-point at Wye, the size of the third
``further redeployment'' prescribed by the Oslo agreement, Clinton
and his team seem to have let the two sides agree to differ. The
Wye withdrawal comprises the first and second ``further
redeployments'' and, if or when they are completed, the Palestinian
Authority will be in civilian or military control of some 40
percent of the West Bank. The question of the third redeployment is
to be passed to a committee.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu says that the cabinet, when it eventually meets to
ratify the memorandum, will pass a resolution limiting the third
redeployment to just 1 percent of the territory. The Palestinians
reject that out of hand, which, under the wording of Wye, they are
entitled to do.
</P>
<P>
   If, in the weeks ahead, Netanyahu loses the political will that
led him to sign the Wye document, he will find plenty of pretexts
to stop implementation. Several people have already died from
terrorism, and there will be more.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction of the three signatories -- Clinton signed as a
witness -- will determine whether they meant what they signed.

   ``Especially the colonial ones are very confrontative and speak
to us about people's lives'' in a way that modern tombstones rarely
do, she said. ``They read like a book.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, I caught the subway to Cambridge. From Harvard
Square, it's a half-hour's walk to the Egyptian Revival gate of
Mount Auburn Cemetery, established in 1831, listed on the National
Register of Historic Places and fully prepared to welcome visitors
on foot or by car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Discover Mount Auburn,'' urged a pamphlet I picked up from a
rack inside the gate, along with a map that identified gravesites
and monuments, and through which I discovered the Torrey monument.
With its lushly planted grounds and small ponds, Mount Auburn is
the nation's first ``garden cemetery'' and a favorite among bird
watchers. I saw plenty of people who just seemed to be taking a
walk, including two women pushing strollers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word cemetery derives from the Greek and means sleeping
place.'' the pamphlet said. ``Its use in this country began with
Mount Auburn's founding.'' In that sense, it replaced the more
prosaic term burying ground.
</P>
<P>
   In place of the winged skulls in the older burying grounds,
there are at Mount Auburn obelisks, stone urns, broken columns and
Celtic crosses. Another difference is that a number of the older
graveyards are often linked to the Revolution, its veterans buried
therein, while Mount Auburn carries associations with the Civil
War.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Ward Howe, author of ``The Battle Hymn of the Republic,''
is buried there.
</P>
<P>
   And one can also find a monument of a brown stone framing a
piece of carved white marble, erected by Robert Gould Shaw, a
Boston merchant whose grandson (of the same name) commanded the
54th Massachusetts infantry, the African-American regiment pictured
in the 1989 movie ``Glory.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby a large stone sphinx commemorates the North's victory,
with the inscription ``American Union Preserved, African Slavery
Destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Another imposing structure, devoid of martial claims, sits above
a pond called Halcyon Lake in the cemetery's southwestern corner. A
circle of eight Corinthian columns on an elevated base mark the
tomb of Mary Baker Eddy, founder of Christian Science and one of
the most influential female figures in American religious history.
</P>
<P>
   A great concentration of the 19th-century's literary genius lies
about 20 miles away in Concord's Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, a rambling
spread near the town's center. On a rising ground called Authors'
Ridge are the graves of Henry David Thoreau, Nathaniel Hawthorne
and Louisa May Alcott, as well as a rough chunk of granite over the
resting place of Ralph Waldo Emerson.
</P>
<P>
   Emerson is flanked by his wife, Lidian; their son Waldo, who
died at age 5, and their daughter Ellen, whose epitaph notes that
although ``of a fine mind, she cared more for persons than for
books.''
</P>
<P>
   Personal statements of an earlier time can be found at the Old
Hill graveyard, overlooking Concord's center. On some 18th-century
headstones are carvings of tiny, impassive-faced figures standing
in arched doorways. Those, Ms. Gabel said, were the work of a local
carver and adorn the stones of women and children.
</P>
<P>
   One of those stones marks the resting place of Elizabeth Blood,
dead in 1775 at age 34. Whoever carved it came from the same
tradition as the person who put the Latin phrases on the
gravestones at King's Chapel.
</P>
<P>
   The epitaph states, in part: ``All you that passeth by, as you
are now, so once was I, as I am now, so must you be, prepare for
death and follow me.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words, Ms. La Rue said, are ``the most common couplet
found on stones'' of that period.
</P>
<P>
   And not easily forgotten, I might add.

   JERUSALEM -- Ominous cries of ``Bibi - traitor!'' heard at
demonstrations in Israel this week have rightly rattled the Shin
Bet security service. Nov. 4 will mark the third anniversary of the
assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, who was killed for launching the
peace process between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Now Benjamin Netanyahu, reluctantly and after two-and-a-half
years of feints and delays, has endorsed the principle of
land-for-peace that underlies the Oslo peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is my partner now,'' said Yasser Arafat last Sunday, ``like
Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres.''
</P>
<P>
   The stormy outpourings of the far right illustrate the change
that the prime minister has wrought in Israel's political
alignments. The terms right and left had long ceased to distinguish
adequately between the populist Likud and the largely middle-class
Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
   Now the overworked ornithology of hawk and dove may have to be
discarded too. To the settlers and their political hinterland,
Netanyahu has become more contemptible than the most cooing dove.
``I'd rather have Ehud Barak,'' says Yisrael Harel, a settler
ideologue, referring to Labor's leader. ``At least he talks
straight.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Barak is finding it difficult to talk straight. He is
torn between Labor's support for the Wye memorandum, which
Netanyahu and Arafat signed on Oct. 23, and the party's temptation
to make common cause with hardline coalition renegades in order to
topple the government.
</P>
<P>
   The polls show unambiguous public backing for the accord. So
Barak is offering a safety-net for the government in the Knesset
during the three-month implementation period. But, confusingly, he
still insists that Netanyahu is a national disaster and must go.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu is plainly uncomfortable, personally and politically,
with the new, centrist profile that the Wye agreement has conferred
on him. Although he needs middle-of-the-road support if he is to
retain the prime ministership, he cannot afford to lose too much of
the far right.
</P>
<P>
   The settlers and the Hasidic Lubavitch sect were his most ardent
campaigners in the 1996 election. Now they are planning to put up a
candidate of their own from among the coalition defectors. The
prime minister argues that he is the far right's best option: Labor
would have ceded far more than the 13.1 percent of the West Bank
that he signed away at Wye.
</P>
<P>
   But the disillusionment of true believers -- many on the far
right are religious extremists -- is not necessarily susceptible to
the logic of political expediency.
</P>
<P>
   In his effort to woo back would-be defectors, Netanyahu is
ducking and weaving for all he is worth. He postponed a scheduled
Thursday cabinet meeting that was to have debated the Wye
memorandum, on the ground that the Palestinians had not yet
conveyed to the Americans their ``security work plan'' to fight
terrorism (under the terms of the memorandum, they have until next
week to do so). There is no definitive map, yet, of the proposed
Israeli withdrawals because Netanyahu still wants to haggle with
the settlers over the precise lines.
</P>
<P>
   But President Bill Clinton's long days and nights at Wye
produced a detailed implementation program that the two sides will
be hard put to wriggle out of. Above all, the agreement provides
for the intimate and intrusive involvement of the CIA in monitoring
action against terrorism. An American-Palestinian committee will
meet every two weeks ``to review the steps being taken to eliminate
terrorist cells.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a trilateral high-ranking committee will meet ``not
less than bi-weekly to assess current threats, deal with any
impediments to effective security cooperation and coordination and
address the steps being taken to combat terror.''
</P>
<P>
   This makes America rather than Israel the arbiter of what
constitutes a terrorist threat and what measures are effective to
counter it. The Palestinians will need to convince American agents
on the ground that they are keeping Islamic fundamentalist groups
under tight control, despite the political discomfort this will
cause Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, America ``has agreed to assist'' the Palestinians in
confiscating illegal weapons; a trilateral committee will monitor
``cases of possible incitement''; and America will be ``briefed''
on which Palestinian policemen will serve in the Palestinian force.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also used the device of direct American involvement to
break an impasse over Netanyahu's demand that the Palestine
National Council, the unwieldy parliament-in-exile, should formally
revoke clauses in the 1964 Palestine National Covenant that call
for Israel's destruction. Members of the PNC are to be invited to a
grand assembly in Gaza, midway through the implementation period,
where they will be addressed by Clinton and ``reaffirm their
support for the peace process'' and for various previous
pronouncements nullifying the offensive clauses.
</P>
<P>
   It is not exactly what Netanyahu had wanted, but he apparently
could not reject Clinton's offer to make good, with his presence at
the convocation, for the constitutional imperfections in the
procedure. Arafat was reluctant to pledge a formal revocation by
the PNC, lest he failed to get the needed two-thirds majority.
</P>
<P>
   On another sticking-point at Wye, the size of the third
``further redeployment'' prescribed by the Oslo agreement, Clinton
and his team seem to have let the two sides agree to differ. The
Wye withdrawal comprises the first and second ``further
redeployments'' and, if or when they are completed, the Palestinian
Authority will be in civilian or military control of some 40
percent of the West Bank. The question of the third redeployment is
to be passed to a committee.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu says that the cabinet, when it eventually meets to
ratify the memorandum, will pass a resolution limiting the third
redeployment to just 1 percent of the territory. The Palestinians
reject that out of hand, which, under the wording of Wye, they are
entitled to do.
</P>
<P>
   If, in the weeks ahead, Netanyahu loses the political will that
led him to sign the Wye document, he will find plenty of pretexts
to stop implementation. Several people have already died from
terrorism, and there will be more.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction of the three signatories -- Clinton signed as a
witness -- will determine whether they meant what they signed.

A BIG MISTAKE

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The last-minute Republican television advertising
campaign trying to turn Tuesday's election into a mandate to
impeach President Clinton is a case of colossal overkill, likely to
produce a political backlash among independents and moderates.
</P>
<P>
   Such contemptible scandal-mongering is bound to snatch defeat
from the jaws of victory in marginal districts.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Republicans seemed positioned to win a net gain of up
to 10 House seats and maybe two or three Senate seats in vigorous,
well-funded campaigns focusing on local issues. But that modest
expectation has been disrupted by the party's sudden decision to
inject Clinton's lying and lechery overtly into the congressional
races.
</P>
<P>
   But not for the better, in terms of GOP prospects. The
commercials themselves will now be the issue, not Clinton's
conduct. They tend to confirm Democratic charges that the GOP is
unfairly partisan and more interested in discrediting the president
than governing. And they feed an image of cold-hearted
narrow-mindedness that periodically plagues the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are defying extensive polling data that indicate
a substantial majority of voters still approve of the job the
president is doing and do not want him to be impeached. Why rub
salt in his wounds when everybody already knows more about Clinton
than they want to know anyway?
</P>
<P>
   This election has not been a referendum on the president's moral
shortcomings. Recent polls showed that 52 percent of those surveyed
were not interested in sending an impeachment message to Congress
while the rest were divided evenly between signaling their support
or their opposition to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Voters resist nationalizing the election despite the fact that
the president's fate could be determined by a dramatic shift of
legislative power. Many more Republicans will mean that impeachment
is more likely. Many more Democrats will mean the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, this campaign has been about what midterm campaigns are
always about _ what have our elected officials done for us lately?
</P>
<P>
   Yet congressional GOP leaders are gambling that the televised
reminders of Clinton's misbehavior will pay off by getting the
party's core conservative supporters to the polls. It is a gamble
they need not and should not have taken.
</P>
<P>
   They ought to have had those supporters locked up long ago. It
is the other voters they should be worrying about, the ones who
might now feel motivated to retaliate against a party that is
piling on the president too eagerly.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich himself signed off on the new
strategy, having apparently learned nothing from the political
outrage provoked by his own earlier efforts to ratchet up the
impeachment issue. Last spring he began denouncing Clinton's
``crimes'' without waiting for any judicial disposition to confirm
his opinions and declared he would never again make a speech
without pounding Clinton on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   The prompt result was that Gingrich, never popular, sank in the
public opinion polls. He responded by muting his public rhetoric
for a time, abandoning his pledge to keep tongue-lashing Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Yet after congressional Republicans, with unseemly haste,
released the president's embarrassing videotaped grand jury
testimony denying that oral sex with Monica Lewinsky was sex,
Gingrich's approval ratings dropped even further, to a pitiful 18
percent. The voters have been trying to send a signal that enough
is enough. Strangely, Gingrich still doesn't get it.
</P>
<P>
   Guess who was among the first Republicans to applaud the new
advertising campaign? Gingrich's ideological buddy, right-wing Rep.
Bob Barr of Georgia, one of the last public figures to cling to the
conspiratorial notion that White House aide Vincent Foster was
murdered and who demanded Clinton's impeachment a year ago, before
anyone ever heard of Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Barr gleefully called the commercials ``refreshing,'' a strange
turn of phrase for such a bombs-away campaign. But Barr is so out
of tune with Americans who reject extremes of right and left that
his approval practically guarantees a counter-reaction.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans placed the ads in some 30 congressional
districts where Clinton is unpopular and where they figured on
maximum favorable impact. But free media _ repeated television and
newspaper stories _ spread the message nationwide, to districts in
which independents and moderates often prevail.
</P>
<P>
   This inflammatory outreach into unfriendly territory is not
good, if you are trying to use local elections to bring down a
popular president. In 1861, John Stuart Mill in ``Considerations of
Representative Government'' described conservatives as ``being by
law of their existence the stupidest party.''
</P>
<P>
   He had something there.

   SEATTLE -- The gurus of social trends keep on about Seattle: it
is the capital of camping hardware and computer software, of chic
coffee and anti-chic grunge.
</P>
<P>
   But this corner of America sets political trends almost as
frequently as social ones. The state of Washington, which Seattle
dominates, boasts the nation's first governor of Asian ancestry.
Its voters lead the country in sending women to the state
legislature. And its elections offer the clearest illustration in
America of the forces corroding party politics.
</P>
<P>
   One most striking agent of this corrosion is Linda Smith, a
small, fierce congresswoman who is now running for the Senate.
Smith comes from a union family, and toes the union line on trade
agreements: she is against them, even though Washington's big
companies (notably Boeing and Microsoft) depend on exports.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, moreover, refuses on principle to accept money from
corporate political action committees, declaring that she prefers
to represent the little guy; she seldom misses a chance to denounce
government subsidies to industry as ``corporate welfare.'' She is
especially hostile to the tobacco lobby; she is a passionate
human-rights campaigner; she is a critic of Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, she sounds a perfect Democrat. And yet she is
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, anyway: how long is anybody's guess. Until 15
years ago she was indeed a Democrat. But she is not only against
big business; she is against gun-control and abortion rights,
against taxes and regulation and government in general, and so in
1983 she became a Republican instead.
</P>
<P>
   Since then her party affiliation has not prevented her from
befriending Ross Perot, who invited her in 1996 to be his
presidential running mate; and some speculate that Smith may one
day grow contemptuous of Republicans and split from them.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that she already displays a contempt for her
party more profound than that of any splitter. She believes she can
mock its leadership and many of its policies, and remain part of it
all the same.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is not shy about her anti-Republican opinions; on the
contrary, she preens. One of her TV ads boasts that she has voted
against her fellow Republicans in Congress; another attacks her
opponent, Sen. Patty Murray, as a slavish follower of her party's
line. ``The party should not control you,'' she says, eyes burning.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just Smith's policies that clash with her party; her
tactics do too. Republican bigwigs did not want her to run for the
Senate, and they encouraged a pro-business free-trader to have a
go. Smith ran anyway, not only despite the party hierarchy but
actually against it. She called Sen. Mitch McConnell, chairman of
the Republican senatorial committee, ``one belligerent person who
likes the laundering of money.''
</P>
<P>
   When McConnell withheld campaign cash, Smith turned this snub
into a rallying cry for the network of supporters she calls
``Linda's army.'' ``Nobody's senator but yours,'' runs the Smith
campaign slogan. If she wins, it goes without saying that she will
not be the Republican Party's senator: a substantial chunk of
Linda's army consists of Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is extreme, admittedly. But a milder version of her
anti-party politics infuses Washington's other election campaigns.
In the state's hottest congressional race, for example, Jay Inslee
is running as a Democrat who is determined not to be associated
with the policies of fellow Democrats in Congress. Rick White, the
Republican, is equally determined to distance himself from the
Gingrichite politics that he once espoused.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates all over the state sense that party labels are a
burden. The culture of the countryside is set by
outdoorsmen-individualists; the culture of the suburbs is set by
cyber-individualists; around two-fifths of the state's voters
describe themselves as ``independent'' rather than Republicans or
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Is Washington's anti-party politics going to spread across the
country? In one sense, it spread long ago: party affiliation in
America has always been looser than in other democracies. Yet
something new is stirring. Few other states (with the notable
exception of Maine) have as many self-proclaimed independent voters
as Washington has, but many are seeing the share of independents
increase.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of television encourages voters to focus on candidates
rather than on their parties; the rise of lobbies encourages a
focus on single issues rather than multi-issue party manifestos;
the rise of referendums reinforces this single-issue trend. For all
these reasons, the relevance of party is fading, and Linda Smith
and her army may represent the shape of politics to come.
</P>
<P>
   And yet it is not certain. For one thing, Smith may lose her
election (the betting is cautiously against her). If this happens,
Republican bigwigs may crow that running against your own party is
a sure route to defeat.
</P>
<P>
   For another, there is a difference between anti-party
campaigning and anti-party behavior once in office. Washington's
candidates have long cast themselves as independents. But David
Olson, a political scientist at the University of Washington,
reckons that party affiliation is the single greatest determinant
of how the state's legislators vote on bills that come before them.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-party rhetoric is rather like the coffee fad in Washington:
everyone drinks what looks like strong stuff, but it is often
decaffeinated.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the struggle between party and anti-party will
doubtless come down to money. In the absence of campaign-finance
reform, national party committees will be able to raise ever-larger
pots of unregulated ``soft'' money, and use these to buy
candidates' respect.
</P>
<P>
   By announcing a monster ad campaign this week to remind voters
about Monica Lewinsky, the Republican Party has assured that it
will break all past spending records during this campaign. All of
which lends Smith's attack on the ``money-laundering'' Republican
leadership a truly national significance.
</P>
<P>
   The real fight in Washington is not Smith vs. Murray. It is
Smith vs. McConnell.

line. ``The party should not control you,'' she says, eyes burning.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just Smith's policies that clash with her party; her
tactics do too. Republican bigwigs did not want her to run for the
Senate, and they encouraged a pro-business free-trader to have a
go. Smith ran anyway, not only despite the party hierarchy but
actually against it. She called Sen. Mitch McConnell, chairman of
the Republican senatorial committee, ``one belligerent person who
likes the laundering of money.''
</P>
<P>
   When McConnell withheld campaign cash, Smith turned this snub
into a rallying cry for the network of supporters she calls
``Linda's army.'' ``Nobody's senator but yours,'' runs the Smith
campaign slogan. If she wins, it goes without saying that she will
not be the Republican Party's senator: a substantial chunk of
Linda's army consists of Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is extreme, admittedly. But a milder version of her
anti-party politics infuses Washington's other election campaigns.
In the state's hottest congressional race, for example, Jay Inslee
is running as a Democrat who is determined not to be associated
with the policies of fellow Democrats in Congress. Rick White, the
Republican, is equally determined to distance himself from the
Gingrichite politics that he once espoused.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates all over the state sense that party labels are a
burden. The culture of the countryside is set by
outdoorsmen-individualists; the culture of the suburbs is set by
cyber-individualists; around two-fifths of the state's voters
describe themselves as ``independent'' rather than Republicans or
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Is Washington's anti-party politics going to spread across the
country? In one sense, it spread long ago: party affiliation in
America has always been looser than in other democracies. Yet
something new is stirring. Few other states (with the notable
exception of Maine) have as many self-proclaimed independent voters
as Washington has, but many are seeing the share of independents
increase.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of television encourages voters to focus on candidates
rather than on their parties; the rise of lobbies encourages a
focus on single issues rather than multi-issue party manifestos;
the rise of referendums reinforces this single-issue trend. For all
these reasons, the relevance of party is fading, and Linda Smith
and her army may represent the shape of politics to come.
</P>
<P>
   And yet it is not certain. For one thing, Smith may lose her
election (the betting is cautiously against her). If this happens,
Republican bigwigs may crow that running against your own party is
a sure route to defeat.
</P>
<P>
   For another, there is a difference between anti-party
campaigning and anti-party behavior once in office. Washington's
candidates have long cast themselves as independents. But David
Olson, a political scientist at the University of Washington,
reckons that party affiliation is the single greatest determinant
of how the state's legislators vote on bills that come before them.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-party rhetoric is rather like the coffee fad in Washington:
everyone drinks what looks like strong stuff, but it is often
decaffeinated.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the struggle between party and anti-party will
doubtless come down to money. In the absence of campaign-finance
reform, national party committees will be able to raise ever-larger
pots of unregulated ``soft'' money, and use these to buy
candidates' respect.
</P>
<P>
   By announcing a monster ad campaign this week to remind voters
about Monica Lewinsky, the Republican Party has assured that it
will break all past spending records during this campaign. All of
which lends Smith's attack on the ``money-laundering'' Republican
leadership a truly national significance.
</P>
<P>
   The real fight in Washington is not Smith vs. Murray. It is
Smith vs. McConnell.

ANTIQUES: AN UNCELEBRITY AS FOLK ART FAN; WHERE THE BUYERS ARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Colo., Fla., N.Y., Va.)  (bl) 
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's clear that American folk art has come into its
own when it can attract collectors as diverse as Robert Redford,
Dustin Hoffman, Woody Allen, Ronald Lauder and David Teiger.
</P>
<P>
   David who?
</P>
<P>
   Teiger is a successful New Jersey management consultant who has
used his business acumen to assemble a collection that is the envy
of every folk art museum in the country. ``He has relentlessly
pursued the best of the best,'' said Nancy Druckman, the folk art
specialist at Sotheby's. ``His collection just shouts quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Teiger owns several of the icons in the field: the ``Miss
Liberty'' wood sculpture once owned by the late collector Bernard
Barenholtz which was sold for $71,500 at a Sotheby's auction in
January 1990; ``Captain Jinx,'' a beloved carving of a Civil War
soldier; the late Herbert Hemphill Jr.'s playful pine horse weather
vane; the elegant curlew that set an auction record in 1997 for a
piece of folk art sculpture, and the trumpeting ``Angel Gabriel''
weather vane, which was sold for $44,850 in March 1995 at the sale
of the Bill Holland collection at Sotheby's. The list goes on.
</P>
<P>
   Teiger was virtually unknown in the art field until this week,
when Harry N. Abrams published ``Spiritually Moving,'' a sumptuous
coffee-table book about his collection that was put together by the
graphic designer Tom Geismar and by Harvey Kahn, an expert in folk
art, with essays by Kahn and others. Though the book does not
mention Teiger's name, the secret leaked out and is sure to be a
topic of conversation this year at the Fall Antiques Show.
</P>
<P>
   The show, which runs from Nov. 19 through Nov. 22 at the 7th
Regiment Armory in Manhattan, is celebrating its 20th anniversary
with a benefit preview for the Museum of American Folk Art on Nov.
18.
</P>
<P>
   Teiger began his collection eight years ago, when he asked Kahn,
who is a New Jersey neighbor, to help him put one together. Teiger
already owned an important group of contemporary paintings and had
commissioned the perfect setting for his collection-to-be: a
cutting-edge house designed by Michael Rotondi and Clark Stevens of
Roto Architects of Los Angeles, since featured on the cover of
Architectural Digest.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn, a founding member of the Folk Art Society, had long
collected folk art and had 40 years of experience in the field, but
found it challenging to work with Teiger because his collecting
criteria was unique. Teiger would only buy an object if he found it
``spiritually moving.''
</P>
<P>
   Teiger explained in a telephone interview: ``I'm looking to be
inspired, motivated, titillated by art. I want to be surrounded by
objects that give me positive energy.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``Of course I want first-rate pieces. I look for
authenticity, integrity, original natural surface, and a strong
sense of color and texture. But the most important thing is that I
react in my gut.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Walters, a dealer and former curator at the Abby Aldrich
Rockefeller Folk Art Center in Williamsburg, Va., who contributed
an essay to ``Spiritually Moving,'' wrote that Teiger's
connoisseurship ``is tightly focused on esthetics alone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, historians, ethnologists, students of popular
culture, collectors and dealers have been engaged in a war over
semantics in an attempt to define and validate precisely who the
`folk' are and whether what they make should be called naive,
primitive, popular, vernacular, visionary or outsider art,'' he
wrote. ``This collection is about the art of appreciation, taking
objects out of one context and putting them in another.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Giampietro, a New York dealer who helped Teiger acquire
items, said: ``David Teiger is the first person who has come along
who has bought folk art as art. Most approach it from the
decorative standpoint. He treats it as an accepted great art.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Maresca, another veteran New York folk art dealer, called
Teiger ``one of the most discerning collectors I've ever met,''
adding, ``He has taken folk art to a level I never knew existed.''
</P>
<P>
   Where the Buyers Are
</P>
<P>
   ``Location is everything,'' said David Lester, the Florida-based
organizer of four antiques fairs.
</P>
<P>
   He should know. The founder of the three-year-old Palm Beach
International Fine Art &AMP; Antique Fair, is branching out. Thursday
he opened his first Beverly Hills International Art &AMP; Antique Fair.
Next summer he plans to inaugurate similar fairs in Aspen, Colo.,
and in the Hamptons.
</P>
<P>
   The Beverly Hills fair is being held at the intersection of
Wilshire and Santa Monica boulevards _ action central.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's within 5 to 10 minutes of all the major homes in Beverly
Hills and Bel Air,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He got permission to build a giant tent on the roof of a
2,000-car parking garage next to Robinsons-May department store.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to catch people where they are,'' Lester said. ``I
lived in L.A. for 20 years, and it's like Palm Beach. People won't
go any great distance to attend a fair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It cost $1 million to put up my tent,'' he continued. ``We
take the same tent everywhere. It's an elite movable shopping
center.''
</P>
<P>
   Some shopping center. About 30 of the 55 exhibitors are
European, including the London jewelers Asprey/Garrard; Peter Finer
of Warwickshire, England (antique arms and armor) and Bernard
Steinitz of Paris (important French antiques and period paneling).
The fine art dealers are selling Old Masters, Impressionists,
modern paintings, even Latin American art.
</P>
<P>
   Nine fine jewelers hope to attract the Hollywood glitterati.
</P>
<P>
   To this end, Lester assembled a Collectors Committee for the
fair that is chaired by Mario Buatta, the New York interior
designer who was in charge of New York's Winter Antiques Show for
17 years. The committee also includes renowned Los Angeles art
patrons like Iris Cantor, Caroline Ahmanson and Wallis Annenberg,
as well as collectors like Julian and Joanne Ganz Jr., and Jack and
Joan Quinn.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fair has to be dazzling and impressive so people feel it's
worth their time,'' Lester said. ``It has to be a cultural
experience with everything from Art Deco carpets to 18th-century
French boiseries. Fairs are entertainment. Ninety-five percent of
the attendees don't buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he pointed out, the 5 percent who do, buy a lot.
At his Palm Beach fair last January, he said, the dealers did $50
million worth of business in 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles may have several world-class museums now, but it
suffers from a dearth of good galleries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Second City syndrome,'' Lester said. ``When people
went to buy something major, they flew to New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem also is geography.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles is so spread out it would take a month to see 50
dealers,'' he said. ``At our fair, you can see them in three
hours.''

   JOHN GLENN BEGINS SHUTTLE MISSION
</P>
<P>
   GLENN _ The main story. Glenn's launch goes off without a hitch,
and the nation swoons. We'll have everything in this one from
Glenn's first words in orbit to what the control tower finally has
decided to say in place of ``Godspeed John Glenn.'' President
Clinton led the cast of VIPs that included nearly his entire
cabinet, two dozen members of Congress and the Senate, and Gov.
George Voinovich. We get reaction from the biggies. Despite the
obvious appeal of relating his first flight to
</P>
<P>
   this one, little about today's flawless countdown, crystal clear
sky and righht-on-schedule liftoff was reminiscent of the 1962
flight. The media crowd thickened as launch closed in, and the
VIPs, who trolled through to do interviews during the mundane wait
of the countdown dissappeared late in the morning to be bussed out
to special viewing sites along the nearby Banana River. But the
drama of liftoff represents only a fraction of the crew's work for
the day. Eight minutes after launch, when orbit is achieved, the
workday really begins as the orbiter is reconfigured for use as a
laboratory. (Montgomery, Dayton Daily News) 50 inches. WITH PHOTOS
ETA: 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   w/GLENN-MILLER _ John Glenn's closest friend, Lt. Gen. Tom
Miller, talks with us before and then after the launch. Miller, who
has known Glenn since the two graduated near the top of their class
in the Navy's flight school 50 years ago, saw Glenn for thhe crew's
final family and friend visit at the launch pad. Although cleared
family were allowed contact with the crew, Miller and his wife were
separated from Glenn by a ditch. ``I've never seen him in better
spirits. I think it's doggone wonderful.'' (Montgomery, Dayton
Daily News) 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   GLENN-MEDIA _ John Glenn's return to space prompted one of the
biggest news media
</P>
<P>
   turnouts in the history of manned space flight but he wasn't the
only reason the interest. (Gaffney, Dayton Daily News). 5 p.m. ETA
</P>
<P>
   GLENN-BRUCE _ Now that John Glenn is back in space, the question
naturally arises: is it worth it? Ask the men who flew with Glenn,
the original Mercury astronauts, and they'll tell you. ``In my
view, John's return to space has been a marvelous thing for the
country,'' said Scott Carpenter. ``It has been a marvelous thing
for the space program and NASA.'' (Bruce, Dayton Daily News) 14

plane crash on Ga. 400 Wednesday night. National Transportation
Safety Board officials will hold press conference at 5 p.m.;
highway is completely reopened. NTBS officials were today examining
air traffic control records at the Atlanta Air Control center. The
investigation is expected to take months. Fulton County police said
no criminal charges are anticipated. (Schrade, Atlanta

<P>
   w/PLANE-PILOT _ATLANTA _ Working to get interview with female
pilot, Laurie Ewald, 40, of Hoover, Ala., What went wrong? The

   PBP-CLINTON (DEVELOPING) _WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ What Clinton
said, did, ate and who he met while he was in Palm Beach. Whether
Hillary was with him. When he arrived and when he left. Did he say
anything about the space launch? (O'Meilia/Weis, Palm Beach Post)
</P>
<P>
   GA-CAMPAIGNADS _ATLANTA _ In campaign ads for lieutenant
governor, Mitch Skandalakis accuses his oppenent, Mark Taylor, of
being treated for drug treatment, which still plagues him. Taylor,
who has admitted using drugs in the early 1980s, sued for slander,
saying he's never been addicted and hasn't used drugs at all in
years. Is Skandalakis telling the truth, and does he have any
evidence to support the accusation? Does Taylor have any chance of
winning his lawsuit? How are the allegations and lawsuit playing
out in the race? First, Skandalakis _ who has a history of shooting
from the hip and getting sued for it _ won't tell us if he has
anything, but hasn't shown anything yet. Second, Taylor has no
chance of winning, since the courts protect speech in political
contests _ and it's unlikely he'll pursue it after the election.
Third, experts say it's only up to the voters to set limits on ugly
tactics and counter-spin. Mitch's campaign has been highly out of
line, some of them agree, but they've seen worse. Lawsuits such as
this are rare but not highly so; in fact, U.S. Rep. Richard
Gephardt was sued this week by his opponent in a similar case.
(Kroft/Eckstein, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   TRIPLE _ ATLANTA _ Familes of two Florida men slain in Atlanta
take a very small measure of comfort in believing that they are
helping police by answering questions about the men. Atlanta cops
have called the trucking company where both men worked and have
spoken with the widow of one victim and the girlfriend of another.
They have also asked questions of other relatives and expect to fly
to Orlando soon for more questions. (Bixler, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)

   NCRACE _ Headed into the final weekend before the election, Sen.
Lauch Faircloth is battling for his life, drawing some last minute
help from issue ad groups. (Foskett, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   TREE-CUTTER _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Two days before Christmas,
farmer Scott Brown telephoned Palm Beach County's environmental
resources office. This was no Yuletide courtesy call. ``I'm going
to start cutting the trees in an hour,'' Brown warned. He was
arrested, but acquitted. The judge ruled that Brown's tree-killing
wasn't criminal. In a memo released Wednesday, county officials
blame Raineri and Smith for failing to appear at the trial, the
State Attorney's Office for its handling of the case, and the judge
for refusing to allow evidence to be admitted at trial. ``It's a
travesty of justice,'' county Commission Chairman Burt Aaronson
said Wednesday. ``It gives people a license to do what they want
against code.'' Officials are waiting for Brown's next move. His
attorney, Mark Perry of Delray Beach, said Brown is contemplating
it. (Freeman, Palm Beach Post) MOVED

N.Y. CITY HALL: AN UNPRETENTIOUS MIRROR FOR THE METROPOLIS

Phillip Lopate, novelist and essayist, is the editor of ``Writing
New York'' (Library of America), a collection of writings about the
city. 
(bl) 
 By PHILLIP LOPATE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This city is too nearly infinite to have a center,
too hot-and-cold to locate its putative heart. But if one place can
claim a measure of overall symbolism for the metropolis, it is City
Hall and its adjoining park.
</P>
<P>
   City Hall itself is both grace note and anomaly, surrounded by
Park Row, which once housed the legendary newspapers of James
Gordon Bennett, Horace Greeley, Joseph Pulitzer and William
Randolph Hearst, and now plays host to hipper media like J&AMP;R
Music/Computer World; by that majestic cathedral-skyscraper, the
Woolworth Building, with its beige and taupe terra cotta cladding;
by the muscular Municipal Building, a McKim, Mead &AMP; White wedding
cake of Stalinist-architecture bulk, abutting the on-ramp to the
Brooklyn Bridge; by Ellen's Coffee Shop, a New York institution run
by an ex-Miss Subways, its walls covered with other Miss Subways
winners; and by the masses of civil service workers on lunch break,
shoppers frequenting bargain-discount outlets and former inmates
just bailed out of the nearby jail, all strolling up Chambers
Street.
</P>
<P>
   An 18th-century petit-palais built at the inception of the
19th-century (1803-1812), City Hall stubbornly offers up its
neoclassical charms, looking nobly trim, without an ounce of
imperial pomposity, its scale suggesting the perfect administrative
headquarters for a city of, say, 200,000. There is something comic
about the fact that this toylike structure, this doll house set
amid skyscrapers, still serves as the command post for the mayor
and City Council of contemporary New York.
</P>
<P>
   I remember the first time I saw City Hall. I was being honored
there, along with other sixth graders, for my composition on fire
prevention. At 12, what did I care about fire prevention? I was a
hack, like most early achievers, turning out facile prose to meet
my masters' needs. The call would come down from the Board of
Education for an essay competition on some civics topic _
brotherhood, the Four Freedoms _ and I would oblige, usually to no
avail.
</P>
<P>
   This time I got lucky. On a hot June day I sat on a folding
chair with the other district winners, all goody-goodies, and
listened to the fire commissioner's speech, and went up the City
Hall steps to receive my ``Little Hot Spot'' silver medal. Then (I
like to imagine) I looked up at the graceful relic and my heart
swelled with pride. But I know better.
</P>
<P>
   You step back today and think, ``My God, it's stood up well!''
However, this, you discover later, is not the original facade: age,
weather and chemical pollution had weakened the surface to such an
extent that, in the early 1950s, every stone, column, capital and
carving had to be duplicated in sturdier materials. An amazing
labor of love, testifying to the irreplaceable nature of this
building in New York's mythos.
</P>
<P>
   The interior is less restored, closer to its earlier character.
And it is the interior that is really the dazzling part, with its
flying marble staircases drawing the eye upward to the building's
cupola. Inside, all is curved, sinuous, coquettish, in contrast to
the exterior's bluff rectangularity, so that the effect is of
achieving the impossible: placing a round peg in a square hole.
</P>
<P>
   One tends to forget that New York is not so young; it is older
than Russia's St. Petersburg. But most of 17th- and 18th-century
Manhattan has been destroyed, by fire or the cost of real estate,
leaving City Hall as perhaps the island's oldest structure still
functioning as originally intended (i.e., not retired to museum
status).
</P>
<P>
   City Hall was supposed to anchor the northernmost point of New
York's development, which is why the building faces south. Today,
it seems to be perversely ignoring the majority of its constituents
as it eyes the narrow bunion of land, the original Dutch colony of
New Amsterdam, from which the city grew.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Irving, in his parodic ``History of New York''
(1809), related that the city's streets sprang willy-nilly from the
meanderings of grazing cows. Curiously, Irving wrote this at the
same time the new City Hall was being built. Its French style, its
symmetry and siting, marked the beginning of a more formal vision
of town planning, and augured the abandonment of the ``cow-path''
approach for the geometric grid structure that New York would
ultimately follow.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, around 1790, New York had lost its status as the young
nation's capital to Washington. In return, freed from the stodgy
atmosphere of national politics and bureaucracies, it would develop
a more intensely focused sense of identity: mercantile and
cultural, polyglot and speedy.
</P>
<P>
   The city fathers' choice of such a sophisticated architectural
contest entry (by Joseph Mangin, a French architect, in association
with the Scotsman John McComb Jr.) for their City Hall already
shows a certain awareness of, and confidence in, the destiny ahead.
</P>
<P>
   A century later, Henry James marveled in ``The American Scene''
(1907) that a citizen could still go anywhere inside this City
Hall, with an American confidence that ``the civic building is his
very own.'' He compared such ``penetration'' with the ``romantic
thrill'' of ``some assault of the dim seraglio, with the guards
bribed, the eunuchs drugged and one's life carried in one's hand.''
</P>
<P>
   These days one's approach to City Hall's interior mysteries
seems barred by the burly guard at the door and the threatening
metal detector, suggesting some erosions of democracy since James'
day. Yet the curious may still enter. A sign greets your eyes:
``Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani Congratulates the New York Yankees 1996
World Series Champions. Please Sign In Here.'' The trophies for
1996 and 1998 are both on display. This is tacky on several counts:
the mayor is trying to take credit for the success of one local
baseball team, which offends the delicate sensibilities of rival
Mets fans (like myself) and which introduces a gratuitous billboard
ugliness into a historical landmark of surpassing elegance. I
refuse to sign in (my big rebellion), I pay my respects to the
Governor's Room portrait gallery and leave.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 steps in front of City Hall retain their function as the
place where mayors are sworn in, ceremonial speeches made,
distinguished visitors receive the key to the city, heroes of the
fire and police departments are awarded medals and baseball heroes,
like the mayor's Yankees, are honored.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, political protests, uniformed union picketers,
garbage strikers, school decentralization battles, all came to rest
here. Although professed concern over terrorism has currently made
the steps off limits to such phenomena, City Hall Park remains a
flashpoint for such social struggles as last week's march against
police brutality _ or at least a symbolic stage from which to
launch appeals to the media.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The mayor holds his news conferences at City Hall; the City
Council, with its beautiful gallery for spectators, convenes here
as well, often putting forward a position at odds with the mayor's.
One cannot help thinking, however, in our age of global
interdependency, that some of this political posturing has become a
dumb show, since, in fact, no one is governing New York City, or
can.
</P>
<P>
   In spite _ or because? _ of my skepticism that the mayors of New
York are still in charge, I find these men ruling the city's
imagination like Shakespearean monarchs or buffoons. Just as I
divide my private adult life into eras ruled by this or that woman,
so I categorize the public arena of the last 40 years not by the
terms of U.S. presidents (they are too remote, too abstract) but
New York mayors: Vincent R. Impelliteri, Robert F. Wagner, John V.
Lindsay, Abraham D. Beame, Edward I. Koch. David N. Dinkins,
Rudolph W. Giuliani. These names have an indescribable savor; these
are my madeleines.
</P>
<P>
   Today I loiter on the City Hall steps and watch the lawyers in
gray suits and yellow ties, holding attache cases, conversing with
female colleagues in brown or black suits while their underlings
carry expandable folders crammed with affidavits, legal papers,
etc.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone climbing to the top step and imagining himself orating to
the citizenry would quickly have his fantasy undercut by noticing,
just beyond a shallow strip of pavement big enough for a modest
crowd, a parking lot for official cars.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the space in front of City Hall, once allotted
for civic congregation, has been chopped up and ceded to the powers
that be. It is only after you get beyond this offensively private
car lot, which bisects City Hall Park, that the feeling of public
space takes over again and you experience something like the
original ``commons'' that was intended for the park.
</P>
<P>
   It is a pleasure to see how amicably the park is used by so many
different types: office workers, vagrants, tourists, mothers with
strollers. The formula seems so simple: if you want people to sit
in a public space, all you need do, as urbanist William H. Whyte
sagely observed, is provide seats. City Hall Park has a plenitude
of benches. The trees help immensely in creating a comfortable
atmosphere. For public space to function as naturally and
successfully as City Hall Park, it takes a historical ``walking''
city, a tolerable climate and a habit of malingering.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese families cut through the park on their way to East
Broadway; a troop of black youngsters on a field trip pause in
their march and spread over several benches, Hasidic Jews hurry to
their destinations. Some Puerto Rican children are splashing
ecstatically at the fountain's edge. A middle-aged, overweight man
sits reading a tourist guide to the Greek Islands. On the next
bench, a drunk lies sprawled, sleeping it off.
</P>
<P>
   The flower beds have been nicely planted. Still, there is a
ragged, scruffy quality about this park. It is never immaculate;
the grass always has its share of wrappers, cellophane, coffee cup
lids _ a small price to pay for popularity. With the sounds of
sirens, car alarms, Broadway and Brooklyn Bridge traffic swirling
around, you can't call the park an ``oasis of tranquillity.'' It's
something else again: a feast of urbanism, without apology.
</P>
<P>
   I would be derelict in my duty as cicerone of City Hall Park if
I did not mention another, more notorious building in the park, not
far from the beloved landmark. This is the Old New York County
Courthouse, a handsome Victorian structure that took 20 years
(1858-1878) to build, and became the opportunity for enormous
graft, kickbacks and pocketing of public funds.
</P>
<P>
   The Tweed Ring, a political machine under the aegis of Boss
Tweed, was said to have made off with $10 million of the $14
million construction cost. The building is currently under
scaffolding restoration.
</P>
<P>
   Tweed himself is undergoing something of a rehabilitation by
revisionist historians who argue that the patronage system he
presided over, however nepotistic and corrupt, at least gave the
working class and new immigrants a leg up.
</P>
<P>
   So ``this imperfect triangle of City Hall Park'' (WPA Guide to
New York City, 1939) can be read as an allegory, embodying the
metropolis' three basic types of democratic expression: a formally
elected, representative democracy, as exemplified by the dignified
self-containment of City Hall itself; a more corrupt arrangement
(and what is more typically New York than corruption?) but more
approachable, direct access to power, in the symbolic presence of
Tweed's courthouse; and finally, the Whitmanesque democratic
spirit, characterized by pedestrian flow and the erotics of eye
contact in the expanse of City Hall Park where the people exercise
their sovereign prerogatives of leisure.

ART NOTES: REATTRIBUTING A MURILLO TO VELAZQUEZ; MARDEN DRAWINGS AT
THE WHITNEY; PORTUGAL'S CONTEMPORARY ART MUSEUM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Portugal, Spain, N.Y.)  (js) 
 BY CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is nothing auction houses like to crow about more than
discoveries. And this week it was Christie's turn, with its
announcement that the portrait ``St. Rufina'' was not by Murillo,
as it had been cataloged, but by Velazquez, the master who
epitomized the Golden Age in Spanish painting.
</P>
<P>
   The painting, to be offered for sale at Christie's in New York
on Jan. 29 by an unidentified collector, dates from 1632-34. It was
first recorded in the inventory of Velazquez's patron Don Luis de
Haro, the Sixth Marques del Carpio, who became prime minister to
King Philip IV of Spain in 1643.
</P>
<P>
   The inventory described the work as ``a painting of St. Rufina,
half-length, with a palm and some cups in her hands, original by
Diego Velazquez, three-quarters and a half in height and two-thirds
and two fingers in width.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Marques del Carpio died, the painting's whereabouts
were unknown until 1868, when it resurfaced in the collection of
the Earl of Dudley. In the earl's collection, the painting was
attributed to Murillo.
</P>
<P>
   The Earl's son sold the painting at Christie's in London in
1925, where it was cataloged as a Murillo. It was last seen at
auction in 1948, when it was sold at Parke-Bernet Galleries in New
York, also as a Murillo. Shortly after that auction, it was sold
privately to the collector, originally from South America, who is
selling it at Christie's.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's experts had a hunch that the portrait was by
Velazquez, and so before the auction house agreed to put it in its
sale, it began researching the painting. Researchers found a 1963
monograph that cited an 1802 copy of the Spanish inventory, which
had been lost. Then, the auction house took the picture to the
Prado to be studied alongside the museum's other paintings by
Velazquez. Based on those comparisons, Carmen Garrido, curator and
chief conservator at the Prado, declared the painting a Velazquez.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Crichton-Stuart, head of the old master paintings
department at Christie's in New York, said, ``The analysis is
entirely consistent with the artist's Madrid period and can be
compared to `The Sibyl,' a Velazquez that is in the Prado.'' He
continued: ``The subject of both paintings is set against a
neutral, light-colored ground. Both women have a similar headdress
and the hair in each painting has been painted with fluent strokes
of thinly applied oil paint. The cuffs in both paintings have the
same impasto.''
</P>
<P>
   Crichton-Stuart also believes the painting is a portrait rather
than an idealized face. Experts, he said, have suggested that the
woman may have been one of Velazquez's two daughters, Francisca and
Ignacia.
</P>
<P>
   The last great Velazquez came up at auction in 1970, when ``Juan
de Pareja'' sold at Christie's in London for $5 million. While
Christie's doesn't want to put a definitive estimate on how much
``St. Rufina'' could sell for, it predicted that the work could
bring in more than $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Building a Collection
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Only six weeks into his job and Maxwell Anderson, the
director of the Whitney Museum of American Art, wants to get out
the message that he's aggressive about acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want everyone to know we're active in the marketplace and a
better destination for gifts and bequests,'' he said. ``There's a
lot of competition out there and we're competing.''
</P>
<P>
   To prove his point, Anderson announced this week that the
Whitney had acquired 52 drawings by Brice Marden, spanning 30 years
of the Minimalist painter's career. The drawings are a combination
gift and purchase; the museum bought 11 and Marden gave the rest.
</P>
<P>
   The group consists of 18 large drawings and one of the artist's
complete workbooks with 34 pages of smaller drawings. The works
build on the two drawings by Marden already in the Whitney's
collection, making the Whitney the largest public repository of
Marden's work.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, Marden has used workbooks to record his
ideas. The newly acquired workbook was made in 1987-88 and includes
images he created while traveling in Greece and Finland, and during
time he spent that year in New York and Bucks County, Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Drawings have become a popular area of collecting, and Anderson
seems keen to capitalize on that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drawings are a function of so many artists of Brice's
generation,'' he said. ``They are a pivotal and key part of their
work. Drawings are no longer seen as a second-class area of
collecting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Whitney plans to exhibit its recent acquisitions in ``Brice
Marden Drawings: The Whitney Museum of American Art Collection,'' a
show from Nov. 20 through March 28.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Portuguese Museum
</P>
<P>
   Portugal is about to get its first museum of contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   The Serralves Museum of Contemporary Art is scheduled to open in
June in Oporto, Portugal's second largest city, about 200 miles
from Lisbon. The museum, which will cost $28 million to build, will
be designed by the Portuguese architect Alvaro Siza, and its
holdings will concentrate on the 1960s through the present.
</P>
<P>
   The museum will be owned and operated by the Serralves
Foundation, a nine-year-old partnership among the city government,
Portuguese businesses and benefactors. The foundation is housed in
the Casa de Serralves, an Art Deco house surrounded by a 44-acre
park of formal gardens in the heart of the city. The museum will be
built in the park.
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Todoli has been appointed the museum's director. He was
most recently the chief curator and artistic director of the
Valencia Institute of Modern Art in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't intend to explain art history,'' Todoli said. ``So
far we have a collection of Portuguese art and will be putting
together a collection of international art from the late 1960s
onward.'' Todoli said he had a five-year budget of $1 million a
year to make acquisitions, with 30 percent of the money coming from
the foundation, 20 percent from Oporto and 50 percent from the
Portuguese Ministry of Culture.
</P>
<P>
   Besides working on building a collection, Todoli is also
planning exhibitions, some of which will originate at the museum.
Others will be traveling exhibitions that stop in Oporto.

JOHN GLENN MADE US DREAM AGAIN. WE NEEDED TO. IT FELT GOOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL E. WAGNER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is about dreams and the human spirit. It is about looking
to the stars and wanting to touch them, rather than pull them down.
</P>
<P>
   The sour-grapers call it a publicity stunt or a political
payback. So what? The defenders try to justify it as science. Big
deal.
</P>
<P>
   They all miss the point and the beauty of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, John Glenn, the man who rode an Atlas rocket into
orbit on Feb. 20, 1962, restored our nation's pride and our belief
in heroes. He did it with the humility and the courage that embody
this country's ideals, once again reaching for the stars for the
sheer thrill of it.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn did this at age 77. He is two years older than my father.
</P>
<P>
   Why do we need to debate and analyze? For one day, after a
far-to-long 36-year wait, this country stopped, just as in 1962. We
had a common uplifting bond _ if even for a few fleeting minutes _
before returning to cell phones, faxes and pagers.
</P>
<P>
   We dreamed again. We needed to. It felt good.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was back to our earthbound lives of family, work, tawdry
dispatches from Washington, senseless military conflicts and
reliance on the technology Glenn's flight helped bring.
</P>
<P>
   Space Shuttle Discovery was going into low-Earth orbit with or
without Glenn aboard. He is retiring from the Senate after serving
Ohio for 24 years. Former Utah Sen. Jake Garn took a joy ride
aboard Discovery in 1985 and he did not have Glenn's credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Why NOT use one of the flights during NASA's 40th anniversary _
yes it has been 40 years _ to remind people of the pioneering
spirit our space program represents?
</P>
<P>
   Why CAN'T NASA stage a little publicity? As if no other
government agency doesn't?
</P>
<P>
   Why NOT give a man who had his career as an astronaut taken away
by a secret JFK presidential order because he was a ``national
hero'' who could not be risked a chance to show that age or
physical limitations are not a blinder to dreaming and to show how
far our technology has progressed?
</P>
<P>
   They will run experiments on Glenn, draw blood, check his bones
and urine. Bet they find out he's a remarkably fit 77-year-old.
They are also going to monitor his sleep. Well, OK, he got dropped
from the experiment testing the alleged sleep-inducing compound
melatonin.
</P>
<P>
   But how could they measure a dream?
</P>
<P>
   The most short-sighted argument against this flight is ``all
NASA has shown is that they can send John Glenn back into space 36
years later.''
</P>
<P>
   So all NASA has done is develop a launch vehicle so safe and
reliable, they can put a grandfather on board. Who else can do
that?
</P>
<P>
   Would a 77-year-old human have been strapped into the Friendship
7 capsule in 1962 atop a rocket that had a disturbing track record
of exploding?
</P>
<P>
   No. And therein lies NASA's blessing and curse.
</P>
<P>
   The agency in the last four decades has made the incredible seem
mundane through success.
</P>
<P>
   Over 40 years, there have been tragedies. The Jan. 27, 1967,
Apollo 1 launchpad fire that claimed Gus Grissom, Edward White II
and Roger Chaffee. The Jan. 28, 1986, Challenger disaster in which
Ellison Onizuka, Francis ``Dick'' Scobee, Judith Resnik, Gregory
Jarvis, Ronald McNair, Michael Smith and schoolteacher Christa
McAuliffe perished.
</P>
<P>
   The Challenger launch was not even carried live on the major
networks at that time, a testament to NASA's ability to generate no
publicity through competency. I designed and edited the front page
that day, then went home and cried.
</P>
<P>
   I do not recall such widespread cynical second-guessing and
condemnation prior to McAuliffe chasing her dream. But then, that
was before a horrific fireball in a clear blue Florida sky reminded
the average person just how dangerous the reach for the stars can
be.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Thursday, there have been 91 successful shuttle flights
carrying 239 people to the heavens. An often-forgotten statistic,
but each mission represents a rung in the ladder to the
international space station and a foothold to spring outward.
</P>
<P>
   But let astronauts walk on the moon, or struggle for life in a
crippled Apollo 13 craft, or stand on the end of a robotic arm and
grab a spinning satellite with a gloved hand while the Earth
circles below, or float free in space with a jetpack the only
lifeboat _ and we are slack-jawed.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures of stars being born brought to us by a repaired
Hubble Space Telescope, the images of comet fragments slamming into
Jupiter delivered by the Galileo probe, or the stark landscape
shots of the surface of Mars shot by the Sojourner rover and posted
on the Internet have only added to the wonder.
</P>
<P>
   I was at Johnson Space Center in Houston for the landing of the
first shuttle, commanded by John Young. In the room were hundreds
of journalists from all over the globe. A more cynical lot one
could not find. Almost to a person, we stood and cheered.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle program costs a pittance compared to the B-1 and B-2
bombers that sit idle in hangars or the cost of the savings and
loan bailout.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no other government endeavor, short of war, that
can capture the imagination of this country and the world like the
quest to fling off our earthly bonds and find our destiny.
</P>
<P>
   Even though I use a wheelchair, I applied for the since-canceled
journalist in space program because the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration inspires us to pursue what seems impossible.
</P>
<P>
   My grandpa and grandma, poor dirt farmers in Missouri who lived
in a house with no indoor plumbing, got out of bed on July 20,
1969, to watch a fuzzy black-and-white television transmit live
video as Neil Armstrong stepped onto the moon.
</P>
<P>
   The dream is in our soul.
</P>
<P>
   So to those who look to the stars and see something to drag
down, there is but one response.
</P>
<P>
   Godspeed, John Glenn.

CALCULATING TO THE NTH DEGREE

<TEXT>
<P>
   During the opening moments of ``Cube,'' when you encounter sets
that look like a circuit board designed by M.C. Escher and the
perspective-baffling camera angles, you think, ``Cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, after about 10 minutes, the novelty wears off and you
realize that you have to put up with dialogue in this puzzler about
six strangers trapped in a mazelike prison made up of cubic rooms.
It's not necessarily dumb dialogue _ although dumb dialogue might
have helped, because one of the drawbacks to ``Cube'' is how
seriously it takes itself.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, you'll look at the ceiling and the walls of the
theater and realize, ``Wait a minute _ I'M trapped in a rectangular
room with these people!'' And you probably couldn't be blamed for
seeking your own way out.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all its pretensions, ``Cube'' is perversely watchable;
in fact, it's perversely watchable BECAUSE of its pretensions,
which lend it an unintentional humor that leavens its forced
gravity. Despite its futuristic look, it has the feel of a 1960s
off-Broadway production of a rejected ``Twilight Zone'' script. It
wants to believe in its originality, but it borrows from everything
from Kafka to ``The Poseidon Adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it IS ``The Poseidon Adventure,'' rewritten by
mathematical obsessives _ ``The Pythagorean Adventure.'' Maurice
Dean Wint, as a gruff cop, takes the Gene Hackman role as ruthless
leader; Nicole de Boer, as a whiny math whiz, takes on the Carole
Lynley role as an annoying negativist. The only actor here who
doesn't have a Poseidon counterpart is Andrew Miller, who gives
such an irritating performance as an autistic savant, you can't
really identify with the innocence his character is supposed to
represent. You want him to stay trapped.
</P>
<P>
   The six strangers don't know why they're in the prison or who
put them there; they're not even sure what's waiting for them if
they get out. So they crawl from room to room, some of which have
some pretty cool horror-movie-style booby traps, and bicker over
the best way to escape. Numbers figure in _ BIG numbers. After this
and ``Pi,'' which was a far better movie about math-induced
paranoia, you have to wonder if all those C-pluses you received in
high school algebra were really such a bad thing.

HALLOWEEN ISN'T JUST A KIDS' HOLIDAY ANYMORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE COSTANTINOU  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Eyeglass stores are doing it, with contact
lenses of blood-red irises and eerie cat-eye designs.
</P>
<P>
   A wristwatch company is doing it, with grinning jack-o'-lanterns
on the timepiece faces, and bats and half moons on the bands.
</P>
<P>
   Lingerie shops are getting into the act, advertising wicked
corsets and Merry Widows for that saloon gal and dominatrix hidden
inside you.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that Halloween was the turf of candy shops and
costume stores. Not anymore. In recent years, businesses of every
variety _ no matter how unlikely _ are jumping on the broomstick.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? Even on Halloween, cash is green.
</P>
<P>
   Next to Christmas, no other holiday comes close in wild
spending. Businesses and retail industry experts think that more
money is spent celebrating Halloween than that legendary titan of
party days, New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   For businesses, Halloween is a $4 billion bonanza, and getting
bigger every year, said Scott Krugman, spokesman for the National
Retail Federation, an industry trade group.
</P>
<P>
   In the candy business, in which sales this year are expected to
top $1.7 billion, nothing even comes close to Halloween, said Susan
Smith, spokeswoman for the National Confectioners Association. Lay
out all the candy corn that's out there this season for
trick-or-treaters (and adult sweet-tooths), and the 5.3 billion
pieces can circle the moon twice, with some left over.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a kiddie holiday. But that's the thing. Halloween,
once the one true holiday for kids, is more and more becoming an
excuse for grown-ups to dress up in outlandish outfits and party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it's stopped being just a children's holiday,'' said
Margie Belrose, who in recent seasons has watched her costume
rental business in San Rafael, Calif., go batty. Her store, Belrose
Costume Shop, offers a selection of 3,000 outfits _ all of them for
adults.
</P>
<P>
   In a national survey by American Express this year, nearly half
the 1,000 consumers queried thought that Halloween is becoming as
much a holiday for adults as for kids. Nearly 60 percent said they
planned to spend up to 25 percent more money this year on Halloween
than last year. And 20 percent said they plan to wear a costume
this year, compared with 12 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   How did Halloween turn into such a big adult event?
</P>
<P>
   Theories abound. Perhaps Halloween has been especially big the
past two years because the holiday has fallen on a weekend night.
Or maybe baby boomers rediscovered the holiday when they went
trotting out with their kids for trick-or-treat.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Dundes, an anthropologist and folklorist at the University
of California at Berkeley, is at a loss to explain the Halloween
craze.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adults need to escape, too, as we become more and more
stressed,'' Dundes said in his most professorial tone.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, what the heck. ``It's a great excuse for a party,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With so much buildup and so much at stake, Halloween is not just
a holiday anymore. It's become a season.
</P>
<P>
   Parties are not just on Halloween night, but spread out over the
last two weekends of the month. Houses and storefronts are getting
decorated with lights, jack-o'-lanterns, scarecrows and ghosts.
This year, decorations began popping up in the first days of
October, barely giving the leaves a chance to fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are decorating their homes like they do at Christmas,''
said Rebecca Wade, the bookkeeper at McClelland's Two Rock Pumpkin
Farm in Petaluma, Calif., where more and more couples are visiting
for wagon rides around the farm. ``People are really getting into
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The price of a good old scary time has gone up with the
popularity. American Express reported that the consumers it
surveyed planned to spend an average of $81 this season for
everything from candy to costumes to entertainment.

FINDING TREATS BEYOND THE HITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As video schedules go, November's isn't particularly well
endowed. But beneath a few hits _ ``The Horse Whisperer'' (Nov.
10), ``Armageddon'' (Nov. 17), ``Dr. Dolittle'' (Nov. 24) _ lies an
engaging assortment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been studying how husbands irritate wives to the point
of whatever that point is just before a woman kills a man,'' Robert
Benchley says in ``The Trouble With Husbands'' (1940), a short film
starring the New Yorker humorist of the 20s and 30s.
</P>
<P>
   Nine Benchley films, about seven minutes apiece, make up
``Robert Benchley and the Knights of the Algonquin,'' to be
released by Kino on Nov. 10. Information: (800) 562-3330.
</P>
<P>
   On another tape, the scene moves to Barcelona in the early
1900s. ``Gaudi did not consider architecture as separate from
nature,'' the Japanese director Hiroshi Teshigahara once said of
the Catalan architect, the subject of his documentary ``Antonio
Gaudi.''
</P>
<P>
   Teshigahara's film, made in 1984, runs a searching eye over the
organic, boldly sculptured Gaudi facades and interiors that so
influenced Picasso, Miro and others, accompanied by an effectively
eerie score by Toru Takemitsu. The tape will be released Nov. 17 by
Milestone. Information: (800) 603-1104.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Liv Ullmann's ``Kristin Lavransdatter,'' about a
14th-century woman who decides to marry the man of her choice
rather than her father's. The film, available for the first time on
video, will be released by Home Vision on Nov. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles is another scene. A ``brutal, horrifying, awful,
delightful place,'' says James Ellroy, the down-and-dirty L.A.
hipster and crime writer in the 1992 documentary ``James Ellroy:
Demon Dog of American Crime Fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Made by an Austrian, Reinhard Jud a most American-feeling film
extends Ellroy every opportunity to carry on entertainingly about
his stark, gripping fiction, most recently made famous in the film
``L.A. Confidential,'' and possible future projects (a study of the
underside of the Kennedy administration, perhaps, or the Wisconsin
State Police).
</P>
<P>
   Ellroy books to date have been steeped in the pervasive and,
between outbreaks of spectacular violence, hidden corruption of Los
Angeles in the 40s and 50s. Toward the end of the documentary, he
expresses doubts that he could write crime fiction set in
contemporary times, especially in a city, he says, now ``so out of
hand it isn't even believable to me anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   In an odd way the film is also something of a travelogue, with
the writer hunched at the wheel of a gigantic vintage Cadillac
convertible maneuvering past the hot spots of his youth.
</P>
<P>
   At 39th and Norton is the lot, now somebody's neat yard, where
in 1947 a woman's body was discovered, cut in half. The Black
Dahlia murder case went unsolved and became an obsession of
Ellroy's and the subject of his first book.
</P>
<P>
   There are many other such sites on the Ellroy tour, among them
the spot where his mother's body was found, nude and with a
stocking wrapped around her neck. That crime was never solved,
either. The video will be released by First Run on Nov. 10. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `LES MISERABLES'
</P>
<P>
   By sticking to literary adaptation, Bille August's film performs
a truer service to Victor Hugo's novel than does the musical. This
is sturdy storytelling, with Liam Neeson (left) bringing physical
authority and profound decency to the role of Jean Valjean,
Geoffrey Rush as the driven Inspector Javert and Uma Thurman, with
a photogenic pallor and suffering exquisitely, as the sickly
Fantine.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Claire Danes comes of age as Cosette, Fantine's
daughter, in a tale, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times,
that ``unfolds in a comforting style, serious and intelligent.''
</P>
<P>
   1998. Columbia Tri-Star. $105.77. 131 minutes. Closed captioned.
PG-13. Release date: Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `GODZILLA'
</P>
<P>
   One problem with this lizard who wrecks New York is that he is
too big to fit properly on screen. In the face of such massiveness,
the scientist Niko Tatopoulos (Matthew Broderick) and his
ex-girlfriend Audrey (Maria Pitillo) can only mouth wooden dialogue
in pop-eyed wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Only when Godzilla lays 200 eggs in Madison Square Garden does
the film turn menacing, primarily because the voracious baby
lizards can chase humans around on a scale that imparts some degree
of believability.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, the film is ``so clumsily structured it feels as if it's
two movies stuck together with an absurd stomping finale glued onto
the end'' (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   1998. Columbia Tri-Star. $22.95. 138 minutes. Closed captioned.
PG-13. Release date: Tuesday. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `WILD MAN BLUES'
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Kopple's documentary follows Woody Allen, the jazz
musician, as he leads a band on tour through Europe. Allen himself
is led by his future wife, the assured Soon-Yi Previn, who
instructs him on everything from what to eat to how to swim in the
hotel pool.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a cranky, witty, aging man under the thumb of a young
(and, as he says, notorious) girlfriend. All the while, though, he
plays good jazz, generally enjoys himself despite an exhausting
schedule and gets off innumerable quips worthy of his films in a
piece of ``cinema verite at its most seductive'' (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   1997. New Line. $98.56. 105 minutes. Closed captioned. PG.
Release date: Tuesday. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `HABIT'
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty of blood and sex in Larry Fessenden's vampire
film, but it takes too much time to pull its plot together. At a
Halloween party, Sam ( Fessenden) meets a sexually aggressive young
woman (Meredith Snaider) who bites his lip, is never seen during
the daytime, shuns garlic and avoids questions about what she does
for a living.
</P>
<P>
   As their relationship continues, Sam finds himself losing more
blood, if drinking more beer. Eventually he escapes to his father's
apartment, where he has a showdown with the girl. Fessenden is his
own best actor, but, while ``Habit'' shows promise, ``it is more
dead than alive'' (Lawrence Van Gelder).
</P>
<P>
   1997. Fox Lorber. $89.98. 112 minutes. No rating. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other new titles of interest, some of which may have had a
theater release at one time or appeared on television. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `CATS'
</P>
<P>
   It's not the sort of thing that ordinarily gets to video before
being shown on television, but David Mallet's specially filmed
production of the longest-running show in Broadway history, to be
shown on Monday on PBS' ``Great Performances,'' is available on
cassette. Filmed in London, the show stars Elaine Paige (as
Grizabella) and John Mills. 1998. Polygram. $24.98. 115 minutes. No
rating.
</P>
<P>
   HORTON FOOTE'S `ALONE'
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with his screenplays of ``To Kill a Mockingbird'' and
``Tender Mercies,'' Horton Foote tells the story, directed by
Michael Lindsay-Hogg, of a gentle Texas widower (Hume Cronyn) who
lives alone with the memories of his wife on his struggling farm
and serves as patriarch to a clan that discreetly tries to push him
around. 1997. Fox Lorber. $89.98. 107 minutes. No rating.
</P>
<P>
   `CLARENCE DARROW'
</P>
<P>
   Directed by John Houseman in an adaptation of the 1974 Broadway
play by David W. Rintels, Henry Fonda stars as the controversial
defender, in 1924, of the thrill killers Nathan Leopold and Richard
Loeb and, a year later, the Darwinist John T. Scopes in the
``monkey trial.'' Kino. $24.99. 84 minutes. Information: (800)
562-3330.
</P>
<P>
   `THE LAST DANCE'
</P>
<P>
   In Christian Faber's film, set in the hothouse world of Broadway
``gypsy'' dancers, an aging dancer and lothario named Nick (Rick
Negron) faces the fact that at age 35 he's headed for retirement
and a mundane life in suburbia. 1998. Vanguard. $79.95. 87 minutes.
No rating. Information: (800) 218-7888.

WHEN DEMANDS CONSUME LEISURE TIME, THE RESULTS AREN'T PRETTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: News item: American workers rebel against mandatory
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   News item: Work- and home-based concierge services are a growth
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Hmm. Seems to be a relationship here.
</P>
<P>
   Time is eclipsing money as the most precious commodity for many
workers. Given a choice between working longer hours _ even at time
and a half _ and having more free time, some wage slaves are saying
no to more work.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors workers in Kansas City, Kan., last week took a
preliminary step toward a strike, partly because they say there are
too few workers forced into too much overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Days off. Evening hours at home. Two-day weekends. These are
luxuries in many seasonal and fast-pace industries. But even
40-hour-a-weekers are time-stressed. There's dinner on the run,
kids' activities, meetings, classes and 11 p.m. grocery store runs
so there will be milk in the fridge for breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder that Service Assist Inc., a home-based provider of
the kind of services you'd expect from a concierge in a fancy
hotel, is mushrooming.
</P>
<P>
   Service Assist grew out of an assisted-living center for senior
citizens in St. Louis. In March, it expanded to J.C. Nichols'
apartment properties in Kansas City, focusing on maid service, dry
cleaning and laundry shuttles, van rides for shopping and
appointments, and anything else that helped the mostly retired
tenants get on with the business of living.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, said regional manager Brandon Shedron, its client
base has evolved so half are ``working class'' people who need
home-oriented help and are willing to pay reasonable prices for it.
</P>
<P>
   The clamor from working stiffs fueled a similar start-up in the
lobby of a downtown Kansas City office building. Concierge Royale,
whose owners plan to open similar shops in other business centers
around the area, offers more than 150 different services to harried
workers.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking stuff as simple as renting a video for the baby
sitter to show the kids tonight. (It's ``simple,'' of course,
unless there's no time to squeeze it in.)
</P>
<P>
   One of the pioneers in nonhotel concierge service was Andersen
Consulting, which started offering help to travel-weary Chicago
employees in November 1993. The service expanded to its Kansas City
office in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen, which offers business and management consulting, found
its own people had a nagging complaint: too little time to take
care of their personal lives.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint wasn't solely that employees couldn't meet their
personal needs on workdays. It was that their ``leisure'' time was
consumed with errands and chores so days off were no break at all.
</P>
<P>
   Stressful time off slid into stressful workdays. And that was a
lousy recipe for health, productivity or harmony.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Lawrence, spokesman for the Society for Human Resource
Management, says there's an artful balance between mandating
overtime and making imprudent staff additions to meet boom-time
needs. If business heads south, it's much easier to eliminate
overtime than fire new hires.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the too-much overtime issue is ignored, it's clear that
many workers need exposure to that fine art of balancing. When time
demands from either work or home spill over into the other venue,
the outcome ain't pretty.

FINANCIAL GENIUS PRODUCES MANY DRY HOLES

<P>
   UNDATED: _ After managing to turn the college seed money into
$250 in only two years, the broker recommended we begin our long
climb back by investing that pitiful remnant in a Texas company
that drilled for oil.
</P>
<P>

gave up looking for oil altogether, and turned instead to renting
out its drilling rigs to other people who wanted to go broke
looking for their fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Every couple of years I would remember that stock certificate
lying in the safe-deposit box, and I would take a peek at the stock
market tables to see if I'd gotten rich yet.
</P>
<P>
   The stock went under $2. Then under $1.50. At one point, I seem
to recall, it sank below $1, and that, I believe, is when I stopped
waiting for our ship to come in.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, though _ for the last 17 or 18 years, now _ we have
received in the mail a handsome annual report. It is a richly
produced publication, with many pages of color, and many impressive
columns of numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Always there is a message from the president and chief executive
officer, telling of new strategies the company is pursuing that are
sure to lead to even greater success in the highly competitive
energy business.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know what that annual report costs. And I don't know
what the company president costs. But I suspect they are both
mighty expensive. And I always feel a little thrill of pride to be
a part-owner of an enterprise that is able to borrow the kind of
money needed to support such extravagances.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, the company changed its name. I don't
know if that was one of those revenue-enhancing strategies, or just
a way to elude creditors. Whichever, those swanky annual reports
kept coming.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last week, the mail brought a communication of a different
kind.
</P>
<P>
   It was a summary of a plan adopted by the company's directors,
which, according to the accompanying letter from the president,
will protect my interests in case the company and I become the
targets of a hostile takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Another sentence in the letter caught my eye.
</P>
<P>
   It said the plan, which has been filed with the SEC, will
provide assurance of stability to ``those who are critical to (the
company's) success.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, would anyone care to guess who those indispensable persons
are? I'm betting they're none less than the directors who wrote the
plan, and the president himself.
</P>
<P>
   Of course no ordinary mortal could deduce that from reading the
attached summary, which was written by lawyers and therefore,
naturally, is impenetrable.
</P>
<P>
   It charmed and amazed me, however, to imagine that there might
be great gangs of predatory corporate takeover artists, circling
and shouldering in hopes of gobbling up the prize of this
used-to-be drilling company in which I have a stake.
</P>
<P>
   So I thought I'd better take another look at the stock report,
after all.
</P>
<P>
   And wouldn't you know it, the shares of the company were up more
than 9.5 percent in a single day. That is, they'd gone up 12 1/2
cents _ meaning that after not quite two decades my $250 investment
is all the way up to $143.75.
</P>
<P>
   Leadership that can give a company and its investors stability
like that is worth anything it costs.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reports of funnel clouds and waterspouts filtered into the
National Weather Service at Houston on Thursday. Though fleeting
funnel clouds did not touch down and there were no reports of
damage from waterspouts, their presence was a visual clue that
increasingly humid air was invading from the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, showers and thunderstorms will develop across parts
of New Mexico, west and north Texas, and Oklahoma as humid Gulf air
is drawn inland and lifted by a potent, upper-level low-pressure
system over Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the showers and storms will migrate eastward over
Arkansas and western Tennessee, but they will weaken as they move
farther away from the support of the slower upper-level low over
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, scattered showers and a few thunderstorms will form
near the upper-level low over the mountains of Arizona, southern
Utah and southwestern Colorado, with snow falling only at the
highest elevations.
</P>
<P>
   To the east, broken areas of steady rain and snow will fall
along the Front Range of the Wyoming and northeast Colorado Rockies
as moist winds from the southeast developing ahead of the Arizona
low are forced to ascend the sloping terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Windy, damp and chilly weather will persist across northern New
England as a stationary low-pressure system over the Gulf of Maine
circulates Atlantic moisture inland. Inclement weather will persist
Saturday as a blocking high-pressure system over Hudson Bay
prevents weather systems over central Canada from dislodging the
low over the Gulf of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Long-Range Swells
</P>
<P>
   The stalled center of Tropical Storm Mitch hovered just inland
from the coast of Honduras late Thursday, continuing a relentless,
merciless assault of rain and wind on the Central American country.
Meanwhile, more than 700 miles away off the central Gulf Coast, an
ocean buoy detected large swells bearing down on southern Alabama,
prompting the National Weather Service to issue a coastal flood
watch for water that could spill onto roads along the immediate
coast. The swells were generated several days ago by Hurricane
Mitch as its powerful winds churned in the Caribbean Sea.

POLITICAL GROUPS GET MORE THAN $109,000 IN AMENDMENT 9 CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Political groups in Kansas City and St. Louis
have received more than $109,000 from the casino industry for
``voter education'' efforts aimed at getting Amendment 9 approved
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   That amount represents only a fraction of the $9.9 million that
Missourians for Fairness &AMP; Jobs has reported collecting to date _
almost entirely from riverboat casino companies, according to the
state Ethics Commission financial disclosure reports made public
this week.
</P>
<P>
   The largest private contribution to the group _ $2,000 _ came
from Gemaco, a Blue Springs playing-card maker with an
international customer list, including several Missouri casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Show Me The River Inc., an anti-gambling campaign committee
opposed to Amendment 9, reported raising $140,710 to date,
including $25,000 from Silver Dollar City Inc. and $20,000 from
Shoji Entertainments Inc. Both are Branson tourist attractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Branson and the lakes area is all based on family values and
family entertainment,'' said Chip Mason, a spokesman for Silver
Dollar City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gambling isn't in Branson, yet. But when we see legislation
that expands gambling, we are against that...We get concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   A Shoji spokesman said Wednesday that company officials had no
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Freedom Inc., a prominent African-American political club in
Kansas City, received one of the largest shares of the casino
industry's voter education fund _ $33,000.
</P>
<P>
   Don Poston, a spokesman for the casino group, said many of the
political clubs that received cash this year also worked in the
1994 statewide election to get slot machines legalized.
</P>
<P>
   The money, Poston said, is used to pay door-to-door and
polling-place workers to distribute literature, and some clubs also
provide Election Day transportation to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get out the vote,'' Poston said. ``The more
participation we have, the better chance we've got.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does look like a lot of money,'' Poston said of the
committee's war chest. ``But it takes a lot of money, since we have
to pay for everything to get our message out to 3.5 million voters
in the state.''
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit decided late last year, the Missouri Supreme Court
handed down a strict and literal interpretation of the state
constitution's language that allowed ``games of chance,'' including
slot machines and roulette, only aboard vessels moored ``upon the
Mississippi and Missouri rivers.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling overturned a state law passed in 1994 that permitted
riverboats to be moored up to 1,000 feet off river.
</P>
<P>
   Amendment 9, put on the ballot by a casino petition, would
nullify the court's ruling and retroactively legalize ``boats in
moats.''
</P>
<P>
   Affected casinos include Harrah's Entertainment Inc. vessels in
North Kansas City and Maryland Heights, Station Casino's two boats
in Kansas City, the Flamingo Hilton Casino in Kansas City, the St.
Jo Frontier Casino in St. Joseph and the Players Island twin
casinos that operate in partnership with Harrah's in Maryland
Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Other groups getting casino donations included the Committee for
County Progress (Jackson County), $20,000; 4th Ward Democratic
Club, Kansas City, $1,000; Old Northeast New Democrats Club,
$1,500; Allied Democratic Club, Kansas City, $1,500; Westport Land
Democratic Club, Kansas City, $1,000; and Sni-A-Bar Democratic
Club, Blue Springs, $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   In the St. Louis area, 14 political clubs and organizations
received contributions ranging from $600 to $42,000.
</P>
<P>
   The casino group reported spending $7.9 million through Oct. 22
for such things as consultants, campaign managers, polling firms,
lawyers, printers, postage, telephone banks, television ads and
salaries for 10 full-time staffers.
</P>
<P>
   Of the casino committee's total of $9.9 million, Harrah's and
Station Casino contributed $8.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Other key contributors to the anti-gambling group Show Me The
River included:
</P>
<P>
   CNS Corp., Kansas City, $20,000. The company is affiliated with
Ozark National Life Insurance, and Chief Executive Officer Charles
N. Sharpe is active in the gambling-opposition movement.
</P>
<P>
   Third Baptist Church of St. Louis, $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints,
Independence, $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   John Warren Kindt, of Illinois, a national gambling critic,
researcher and author, $100.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's largest expenditure, $95,000, went into the
production of a radio commercial that began running recently.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Steve Taylor said the group was working this week to
also mount a television ad campaign.

`THE STORY OF AMERICAN FREEDOM': IN LIBERTY WE TRUST _ AN ETHOS
EVOLVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(lb) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1792, fearing the emergence of a monarchical presidency,
Congress directed that the new American nation's first coins
display not the head of the president but ``an impression
emblematic of liberty, with an inscription of the word Liberty''
stamped upon them.
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, when Thomas Jefferson effected the Louisiana
Purchase, he referred to the enlarged country as ``the Empire of
Liberty.'' And three generations after that, at the height of the
Civil War, Abraham Lincoln said of both sides: ``We all declare for
Liberty, but in using the same word we do not all mean the same
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Freedom has always been the American religion, but, as Lincoln
said, the concept has meant different things at different times to
different groups.
</P>
<P>
   The competing definitions are closely described in the new book
by Eric Foner, a Columbia University historian. ``The Story of
American Freedom'' is a retelling of American history, from the
Revolutionary War to the Reagan revolution, organized around the
concept of freedom, its meaning and the way that meaning has been
manipulated, argued and transformed.
</P>
<P>
   The history of freedom, Foner writes, is ``a tale of debates,
disagreements and struggles rather than a set of timeless
categories or an evolutionary narrative toward a preordained
goal.''
</P>
<P>
   That statement is no doubt true and worth remembering as one
reads Foner's well-informed and scrupulously balanced book. And yet
there is something dutiful rather than inspired about Foner's
writing and his approach, which, despite the author's claim to have
taken a fresh look at American history, comes across as a bit
familiar.
</P>
<P>
   It seems rather obvious, for example, that a history including
the Civil War, Reconstruction, Jim Crow, and the denial until after
World War I of the vote to women, never reflected liberty as an
immutable principle.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, and despite a certain blandness in the writing _
freedom as a matter of ``divergent connotations and applications,''
for example _ and despite the abstractness of his approach, Foner
has written an instructive book on the spirit of American political
life.
</P>
<P>
   Foner examines each major period of American history, isolating
the concept of freedom that prevailed at the time, demonstrating
how the concept was either challenged or reinforced.
</P>
<P>
   He treats the Revolutionary War, for example, as a seminal
episode that did far more than simply win independence for the
colonies and create a nonmonarchical republic. The roots of
American freedom lay in the former mother country, but ``its
emergence as a new and distinct ideology grew out of the struggle
for independence and the creation of a nation-state that defined
itself, in James Madison's words, as the `workshop of liberty to
the Civilized World.'''
</P>
<P>
   The great national hypocrisy was slavery and, after slavery, the
institutionalized racism that persisted until after the first half
of the 20th century. Foner shows what seems extraordinary now, that
the debate over slavery was to a degree a contest between alternate
concepts of freedom, one stressing the rights of all to be free and
the other the supposed normal hierarchy of human society in which
some were naturally subordinate to others.
</P>
<P>
   Foner's examples of the effect that slavery had on American
practices and vocabulary are among the book's most fascinating
passages. ``The contrast between liberty and slavery provided a
rhetoric through which those outside the boundaries of American
freedom could challenge their exclusion and, in so doing, transform
the meaning of freedom itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as, in Foner's interpretation, the Revolution established
freedom as the national ideology, the Union's victory in the Civil
War ``consolidated the northern understanding of freedom as the
national norm.''
</P>
<P>
   The Civil War also fostered the image of a powerful government
as the ultimate guarantor of freedom, and this suggests a tension
in American history as old as the nation, the tension between
governmental power as a threat and as the guardian of the
oppressed.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent national debates over the concentration of capital,
for example, echoed the earlier competing conceptions of freedom,
whether it meant unrestricted economic activity or something close
to its opposite, controls on private property to prevent the
economic enslavement of labor.
</P>
<P>
   Foner traces the development of the concept of civil liberties
to court cases involving free speech early in this century. He
argues that the New Deal finally recognized economic security as
``a political condition of personal freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   In the postwar world, Foner argues, freedom became associated
with material prosperity, an association made clear in Richard
Nixon's famous ``kitchen debate'' with the Soviet leader, Nikita
Khrushchev. ``In the 1950s,'' Foner writes, ``freedom became fully
identified with consumer capitalism, or, as it was now universally
known, `free enterprise.'''
</P>
<P>
   Foner ends on a note of description rather than analysis. He
shows how freedom was, in his view, expanded by the cultural
revolution of the 1960s, but also how a different concept of
freedom _ based, again, on economic freedom and the fear of big
government _ came to prevail when Ronald Reagan become president.
</P>
<P>
   The two final chapters, in which Foner covers this ground, are
rapid-fire summaries of recent American history, from the '60s
notion of freedom as an erotically charged challenge to authority
to the Reagan-era concept of freedom based on smaller government
and free enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Foner is nothing if not comprehensive here, as in the rest of
his book, but these final chapters, which involve violently
contested visions of American freedom, seem strangely bloodless as
well as familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Reading ``The Story of American Freedom,'' one is grateful for
Foner's clarity and knowledge even while wishing that he had been
conceptually bolder and more outspoken about his passions and less
dutifully respectful of so many points of view, including those he
clearly does not agree with.

SOON WE'LL GET `SPACE WEATHER FORECASTS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATT CAMPBELL  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: On the weather front, we can expect severe sun flares
and ion storms with a high probability of heavy meteor showers.
</P>
<P>
   That's the real ``space weather forecast'' in our future, and
we'll soon get used to bulletins like it as the government begins
reporting cosmic conditions, just as the National Weather Service
warns of cold fronts.
</P>
<P>
   The Space Environment Center in Boulder, Colo., announced this
week that it would begin issuing bulletins, watches and warnings in
the same format as its sister agency, the weather service.
</P>
<P>
   They would not be ``take cover'' warnings, but they could be
invaluable to modern life. Everything dependent upon satellites or
electromagnetic waves is vulnerable to space weather. That means
navigation, defense, radio and television, telephones and
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Flares shoot out from the sun like giant blowtorches and send
shock waves of ions to Earth, disrupting communication systems. In
addition, tiny meteors slam into satellites like high-speed
bullets, damaging or destroying them.
</P>
<P>
   Solar flares come in 11-year sunspot cycles, and we are
approaching a maximum period in the year 2000. Scientists expect
this peak to be more intense than usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``When these space storms hit, there's a chance for satellites
to be affected, cell phones and computers to be knocked out and
electrical power blackouts,'' said Gary Heckman, senior space
weather forecaster.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1989 _ in the last solar maximum _ about 6 million
people in Quebec were without electricity for nine hours because
the power grid was fried by solar radiation.
</P>
<P>
   The world has changed since then. Use of the Internet, cellular
phones and pagers has grown exponentially.
</P>
<P>
   With warning of solar flares, utilities and companies that rely
on satellite communications can plan ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many satellites up there nowadays, a company may
be able to hop from a vulnerable one to another one and re-route
its traffic,'' said Stephanie Kenitzer of the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Key tools for space weather forecasters are two satellites
locked by gravity into stationary positions between the Earth and
the sun. They are about four times farther out from Earth than the
moon.
</P>
<P>
   One operated by NASA and the European Space Agency monitors
activity on the sun and can give us a two- to three-day alert of
flareups.
</P>
<P>
   The other receives the ion shock wave 30 to 60 minutes before it
hits Earth, giving us verification and emergency warning. That
satellite is a temporary research project, but the Space
Environment Center believes its forecasts will justify a permanent
one.
</P>
<P>
   Meteors are another space ``weather'' hazard. The Leonids meteor
shower, which comes from the direction of the constellation Leo in
mid-November, is expected to be severe this year and next year.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone with satellites, including the Pentagon, is bracing for
the hit from Nov. 16 to 18. NASA will deflect the Hubble Space
Telescope to protect the lens.
</P>
<P>
   The new space weather forecasts will be issued regularly on the
government's weather wire and the National Weather Service's
dedicated radio band. They also can be found on the Internet at
{www.sec.noaa.gov}.
</P>
<P>
   Through those outlets the forecasts probably will begin showing
up in television weather segments, when relevant.
</P>
<P>
   Consequences of space weather can be benign and even beautiful.
Peaks in the solar flare cycle, for example, create geomagnetic
storms that intensify the aurora borealis, or northern Lights. As
we approach 2000 the aurora will be visible farther south, perhaps
as far as the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   But space is not just a light show. Scientists are busy mapping
the trajectories of asteroids and comets that could collide with
Earth, leading to extinction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our backyard has gotten much bigger,'' said George Gale, a
philosophy professor specializing in cosmology at the University of
Missouri-Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   And now there's the outer space forecast, which was announced
the same week that John Glenn was to return to space for the first
time in 36 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turns out the universe is a lot more important to us than
we thought,'' said Gale, suggesting the global economy as an
analogy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be the village economy was important, then the city
economy, and now when someone in Japan hiccups loudly enough we
feel it,'' he said. ``Also now, if a comet in the orbit of Pluto
does something strange, we've got to worry about it.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Probably the first thing to know about the English
violinist Nigel Kennedy is that having returned to the classical
concert stage after a five-year self-imposed exile, during which he
worked almost exclusively on rock projects, he is no longer using
his first name.
</P>
<P>
   In the tradition of Madonna, Prince (in his pre-glyph days) and
the British pianist Solomon, he is now listed on concert programs
and recordings simply as Kennedy. At the end of his program note
for a recent Elgar recording, he added: ``P.S. I've changed my name
because I never liked the name Nigel. Cheers!''
</P>
<P>
   The second thing to know, though, is that he doesn't really mind
being called Nigel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose it was partially a contemptuous thing to do, to rile
the British critics,'' Kennedy said during a recent stopover in New
York, just before starting a tour that includes a run of
performances with the New York Philharmonic and a recital at Avery
Fisher Hall this weekend. Wearing a torn and faded Disney T-shirt,
a frayed leather jacket, nondescript work pants and two-tone hair
(brown and blonde), Kennedy, who is 41, sat on the lawn in Central
Park and reflected on the fallout from this minor provocation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amused that certain people were calling me arrogant for
calling myself only one name,'' he said, ``but they never
questioned their own arrogance in telling me how I should call
myself. But I don't care what people call me.''
</P>
<P>
   And there you have a defining glimpse of the artist formerly
known as Nigel. A product of both the Yehudi Menuhin School and the
Juilliard School, he built his career by producing a sound that can
be either ear-catchingly bracing or uncommonly beautiful and by
giving performances that are sometimes illuminating and sometimes
wayward but which consistently bear the imprint of a willful,
original interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   No one could accuse him of being risk averse. When he recorded
Vivaldi's ``Four Seasons'' in 1987, he added some extremely
idiosyncratic touches, among them a wildly modernist violin overlay
in the slow movement of the ``Autumn'' Concerto, and cadenzas
linking several movements. Critical brickbats notwithstanding, the
recording sold more than a million copies.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Kennedy has made a game of thumbing his nose at the
classical music world. He gave up wearing concert dress, preferring
punk fashion and a variety of trendy haircuts.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing his last performance in New York, in 1992, Bernard
Holland of The New York Times wrote, ``With his coonskin-cap
haircut, patched jacket, flowing scarf, running shoes and amazing
parti-colored socks, Kennedy moved among the tail-coated members of
the New York Philharmonic like a myna bird among penguins.''
</P>
<P>
   In England, he has been known to wave the colors of his favorite
soccer team, Aston Villa, during performances.
</P>
<P>
   But baiting critics is only one of his joys. He also likes to
keep everyone around him guessing what he'll do next. Arriving at
his hotel for a midafternoon interview, for example, a visitor
encountered delegations from Columbia Artists (his managers), EMI
(his record label) and the Philharmonic, all waiting in the lobby
because Kennedy had decided to shower at the time of his
appointments. Eventually, he bounded out of an elevator,
aggressively cheerful but firm about seemingly arbitrary ground
rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``I no longer do posed shots,'' he told a photographer, meaning
he had no intention of being photographed with his violin; he had
no problem, however, posing with a hot dog he bought from a street
vendor. He rebuffed a manager's invitation to dinner, suggesting a
phone call instead, and was unfazed by the fact that his idea of
being interviewed in Central Park _ he said he had cabin fever _
threw the emissaries from the business world into mild disarray,
since they had planned further meetings with him later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh well, you'll find us,'' he said, and wandered out to
Seventh Avenue. His nattily dressed entourage trailed along in the
hope of fixing his location, using their cellular telephones to
leave messages about their own whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   Because Kennedy is eminently marketable and sells lots of
records, no one is about to tell him to behave differently. And
there would be no point in trying; his five-year hiatus, from 1992
to 1997, was his response to efforts by his managers and record
label to persuade him to play the classical music game more
conventionally.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, they wanted him to focus on classical projects
and soft-pedal his interest in rock and jazz. But Kennedy, who grew
up in Brighton and now lives near Bristol, has always been drawn to
popular music.
</P>
<P>
   As a 14-year-old student at the Menuhin School, he spent his
weekends playing jazz with Stephane Grappelli, and soon after he
went to Juilliard at 16, he was sitting with Stan Getz. The day he
made his first recital album, in 1984, he also recorded a
collection of standards.
</P>
<P>
   On one of his albums, works by Bartok and Ellington sit side by
side. And since the late 80s, he has played on recordings by Kate
Bush, Paul McCartney, Talk Talk and the Stranglers and has made two
jazz-fusion albums of his own material, ``Let Loose'' and
``Kafka.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I said I was leaving classical music,'' he said, ``it was
an exaggeration, a way to get people around me to understand that I
was going to have another side to my musical life and that it was
going to be a big part of it. And I had to believe that myself. At
the time I was on the verge of making `Kafka.' If that album hadn't
seemed satisfactory to me, I would have carried on and made another
one, and then another after that until I had made something I could
stand on. So it was a kind of indefinite period that I was going to
be away from classical music, or at least the public performance of
it. Because I carried on playing Bach and other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's programs for this weekend suggest that he may have
found the balance he wants. With the Philharmonic, he is playing
the Elgar Violin Concerto, a work he has recorded twice.
</P>
<P>
   The first recording, with Vernon Handley conducting, established
Kennedy as a young violinist to watch when it was released in 1984.
The second, conducted by Sir Simon Rattle and released last year,
was his return to classical recording, and it has a breadth and
fluidity that the earlier account lacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't consciously trying to do anything differently,'' he
said. ``But I think music is a voyage of self-discovery and also
discovery of other people _ namely, the composers. You don't want
to play the same way many times. Even within a couple of weeks, it
doesn't have to be the same, and after 12 years you hope you have
new enlightenment. My first recording _ I think it was a decent
album but a little too close to the textbook in nature. Now I think
I'm more attracted to the emotional moments in the music.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's recital at Avery Fisher fills out the picture. Half of
his program is devoted to demanding unaccompanied works by Bach and
Bartok. The program's centerpiece, though, is Kennedy's tribute to
Jimi Hendrix, a chamber work he is calling ``Concerto in Suite
Form.'' The work is based on five Jimi Hendrix songs _ ``1983 ...
(A Merman I Should Turn to Be),'' ``Third Stone From the Sun,''
``Drifting,'' ``Little Wing'' and ``Purple Haze'' _ and ``Hey
Joe,'' the Billy Roberts song that Hendrix recorded as his first
single.
</P>
<P>
   ``I relate to Jimi Hendrix's material very strongly,'' Kennedy
explained, ``because he had such big ears for so many different
types of music. You can hear germs of jazz harmony,
rhythm-and-blues, even a Celtic feeling in the melody structure.
What I've done is deconstructed his compositions and put them
together in a totally different type of way. I've written out the
parts for the other players, and I'm out there on a free mission,
so to speak, in the same way that Jimi had lots of well-sorted-out
rhythms going on that enabled him to be free. But that's probably
where the similarity ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The melodic and harmonic structures will be recognizable, but
it will be very much an acoustic feel _ although it's funny,
because by using the bow down at the bridge of the violin you can
get all those feedback kind of sounds that Jimi used to get. But
you can do it in the quietest, most personal moments. It's almost
the inverse of the way Jimi used feedback to heighten everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy has tackled Hendrix before. In 1993, he contributed a
high-energy reading of ``Fire'' to ``Stone Free'' (Reprise), a
tribute album that also includes performances by the Cure, Eric
Clapton, the Spin Doctors, Living Colour and the Pretenders.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is about to record the ``Concerto in Suite Form,'' and he
said the recording was likely to differ from the version he is
playing live. In concert, he will use only his 1735 Guarneri; in
the studio, he will also use an electric violin and is talking
about adding elements influenced by current English bands he likes,
most notably Portishead, Massive Attack and Radiohead.
</P>
<P>
   ``His recording plans are a little mysterious,'' said Roger
Evans, a spokesman for EMI who ended up in Kennedy's parade to
Central Park. ``He's talking about making an album that will be
called `Klassic Kennedy' _ classic with a K _ which I guess will
have the Hendrix on it, but I don't know what else. He isn't
telling us much. I hope I don't read about it in the paper first.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, when asked about his recording plans, was hardly
tight-lipped. ``Klassic Kennedy'' _ he plans to change the name _
is to be an album of short classical works that he has arranged for
violin and orchestra. The Hendrix project is something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hendrix isn't going to be on EMI,'' he said. ``They think
it is, but it isn't, because I'm contractually free, and I'm
irritated after 10 years of trying to get them to adequately
represent my music outside the classical arena. Not so much the
American office but the English office has been on the verge of
obstructing it. They put out `Let Loose,' which was fine, and
`Kafka.' But I really didn't find the same enthusiasm for it as if
I had done `Vivaldi 2' or something. Because I've sold a few copies
of classical music _ mainly things like the `Four Seasons' _ they
see me as an immature artist doing frivolous projects that gets in
the way of what they might have as a preconceived marketing formula
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's view of the pop world is not much more sanguine. Just
as his nonconformist antics have made him a lightning rod in the
classical press, his incursions into pop have drawn attacks from
that side of the business.
</P>
<P>
   The irreverent rock magazine Q skewered him mercilessly a few
years ago, and John Peel, the influential BBC disk jockey, spoke
dismissively of his rock efforts.

   ``The music business is format orientated, largely for the
convenience of the record companies that are trying to sell it,''
Kennedy said with a diplomatic calmness when reminded of these
slights. ``And in pop, they get just as upset as they do on the
classical side when someone tries to rock the boat. Someone like
John Peel has done great things for music in Britain, but
nevertheless, he does tend only to be into bands that sulk and come
in dressed in black. So I'm viewed as classical, and somehow that's
threatening. Anyone who does what I do and tries to come into their
world is going to get flak.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most surprising thing about Kennedy is that beneath
his distaste for the music business and beyond his provocative
responses to it, he is really an old-fashioned Romantic. That comes
through the broad coloristic palette and luminous phrasing of his
second Elgar Concerto recording.
</P>
<P>
   And it is clearer still on his latest disk, a collection of
works by Fritz Kreisler in which he confounds the listener's
expectations by playing such chestnuts as ``Liebeslied'' and
``Tamborin Chinois'' with warmth and suppleness while stripping
away the interpretive treacle that has accrued to them over the
decades. And whenever the conversation turns to the music that
moves him, he drops his guard entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``This `Klassic Kennedy' album, for want of a better title,'' he
said, ``is the kind of music I've never really done on record
before. It's not virtuoso fodder, which I really don't relate to,
but more melodic stuff, which I really love. Things like Satie and
Chopin, maybe `The Flight of the Bumblebee,' and some Sarasate,
where Gypsy music meets the violin. That's what fills my heart well
enough to represent it with true passion. I'm looking for things
that have something more than the pyrotechnique quick route to
impressing people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kreisler is similar in a way. Sometimes I think people
represent Kreisler's short works as virtuoso showpieces too easily.
I'm not interested in them from that vantage point. I just love the
timeless quality of the music, the golden spirit which comes
through, and I hope that in my own way I've captured some of that
essence. My goal was not to copy the way Kreisler played them or
recreate what he did, in the same way that when I'm interpreting
Hendrix, I don't care what solo he played. I'm playing them my own
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's program with the New York Philharmonic includes
Elgar's Violin Concerto, completed in 1910. This deeply personal
work, full of nostalgic themes and impassioned bursts of both solo
and orchestral writing, is the kind of music in which Kennedy
excels. His fondness for Elgar is matched by that of Leonard
Slatkin, who is conducting these performances.
</P>
<P>
   The program also includes Haydn's Symphony No. 99 and Barber's
``Capricorn'' Concerto, with three players from the Philharmonic's
ranks _ Joseph Robinson, the principal oboist; Sandra Church, the
associate principal flutist, and Philip Smith, the co-principal
trumpeter _ playing the solo lines.
</P>
<P>
   Friday at 2 p.m., Saturday at 8 p.m. and Tuesday at 7:30 p.m.,
Avery Fisher Hall, Centercharge, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $14 to
$73.
</P>
<P>
   In his recital, Kennedy will play the Bach Adagio and Fugue from
Sonata No. 3 in C (BWV 1005) and Bartok's four-movement Sonata for
Solo Violin. The real curiosity, though, is the New York premiere
of Kennedy's own ``Concerto in Suite Form,'' a work based on Jimi
Hendrix songs and scored for solo violin, double bass, cello, bass
flute, oboe, two guitars and a vocalist who also plays African
percussion instruments. Sunday at 7 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall,
Centercharge, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $20 to $40.

 &HT;     MARTHA STEWART'S HALLOWEEN: REALLY SCARY 
 &HT;     By DIANE WHITE 
 &HT;     c.1998 The Boston Globe 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Tuesday's ``Martha Stewart Living'' Martha confessed that
she's one of those people who goes ``all out'' on Halloween. No
kidding. When doesn't she?
</P>
<P>
   Martha, true to form, was showing how she constructed a
jack-o'-lantern snake _ ``an interesting and terrifying
decoration'' _ to adorn her Halloween doorstep using nothing more
than 34 pumpkins in assorted sizes, a utility saw, an exacto knife,
a power drill with a borer attachment and three sets of sturdy
outdoor holiday lights. Oh, and a tool called a Pumpkin Eater, a
plastic scraper specifically designed for hollowing out pumpkins.
</P>
<P>
   It was the sort of simple project anyone might undertake if she
had nothing better to do than go out and buy 34 pumpkins, lug them
home, scrape out their insides and bore them full of holes. But why
34 pumpkins? Why not 35 or 36? Or 66? For that matter, why not 104?
It's just one of the many mysteries of Martha. Maybe it has
something to do with the expense of acquiring all those pumpkins,
although money seldom seems to be a consideration in Martha's
world, and why should it be? But she may figure that her viewers
would balk at buying more than 34. Those who have to buy them, that
is, those who haven't grown their own from last year's seeds, the
Martha Stewart way.
</P>
<P>
   I know some of you are thinking: There she goes again. Will she
never stop picking on Martha? Inevitably a reader or two will,
after reading this, write or call to accuse me of being insanely
jealous of Martha. If only it were that simple. I don't begrudge
Martha an iota of her success, because she's earned it. But 34
pumpkins? Is this, as Martha might say, a good thing?
</P>
<P>
   Lately, in the interest of my editor's sanity, I have resisted
the urge to write about Martha. I keep an eye on her though. It's
almost impossible not to. She's everywhere. There have been
occasions when I have been tempted to comment, for instance when
she advised her viewers how to arrange their outdoor woodpiles in
aesthetically appealing patterns. That was unbelievable. But it was
the pumpkins that drove me to this.
</P>
<P>
   There's something about pumpkins that seems to inspire Martha to
creative flights. In autumns past she's used them as soup bowls and
tureens, as cooking vessels, as vases, as doorstops, among other
things. This year, in the October issue of her magazine Martha
provides instructions for readers who wish to make preppy-looking
monogrammed pumpkins that might have rolled right out of a Talbot's
catalog, if Talbot's sold vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   But Martha's ultimate jack-o'-lantern challenge this year is
carving the Colonial Revival cameo pumpkins pictured on the cover
of the same issue. (``The mantel is the perfect place for two
glorious silhouette profiles fixed in a gaze.'') These are
18th-century-style profile silhouettes executed in squash, the kind
of thing anyone with an advanced degree in fine arts could knock
off in an evening or two.
</P>
<P>
   Attempting either the monograms or the cameos requires eight
tools, among them a linoleum cutter, a melon baller and a sabre
saw. Those of us who still attack the Halloween pumpkin with a
kitchen knife and our hands may well feel unworthy, unimaginative
and inadequate just reading the instructions for creating these
Martha-style jack-o'-lantern. Which may be the point.
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible Martha is putting us on with some of these
incredibly elaborate projects? Could the pumpkin snake, for
instance, be her idea of a joke? Is she sitting down there in
Westport, Conn. (``The Martha Stewart State'') at her fabulous
Turkey Hill estate chortling at the thought of her faithful
acolytes reaming out pumpkins by the dozen? I'd like to think so.
It's the only way I can bear it.

   &UR; USE YOUR DRAGON BREATH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By DAVID GRIMES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Since I last wrote about feng shui (literally ``Bride of
Chucky'') earlier this year, I have been besieged (one letter) by
requests for a follow-up.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, as you probably don't recall, I appointed myself
official feng shui consultant for the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, a
building that couldn't have worse feng shui if a poltergeist
suddenly took up residence in its computer system. (Many employees
claim that one already has.)
</P>
<P>
   Feng shui, of course, is the traditional Chinese scam _ excuse
me, art _ of fiddling with one's living (or work) space so that all
is balanced, leading to happiness, health and wealth for feng shui
consultants like myself and, possibly, you, too.
</P>
<P>
   I argued, unsuccessfully, that the Herald-Tribune's feng shui
would be dramatically improved if management were relocated in our
cramped, dim, airless cubicles and the employees took over the
swank executive offices overlooking the McDonald's parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken me some time (three weeks probation) to recover
from that setback, but I'm now ready to impose my will (for a fat
fee, of course) on another feng shui-infested area, namely lawns
and gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Assisting me in this undertaking is a new book by feng shui guru
Lillian Too titled ``The Complete Illustrated Guide to Feng Shui
for Gardens'' (Element, $24.95.).
</P>
<P>
   Lawns and gardens are infested with feng shui, both of the good
and bad variety, Too said. The problem, of course, is knowing which
one you're dealing with, which is where the book comes in handy.
</P>
<P>
   According to the author, ``Identifying and dealing with poison
arrows that are present in the environment are an essential part of
feng shui practice.''
</P>
<P>
   While you may think that your lawn and garden is poison-arrow
free, there are a lot more out there than you might think.
</P>
<P>
   A poison arrow, Too says, is anything that is sharp, pointed,
straight or triangular, or that appears hostile or threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Using that definition, that might include a crack in your
driveway, sand spurs, a ``trespassers will be shot'' sign, your
neighbor's pit bull, or, simply, your neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Poison arrows are bad because they're made of Shar Chi or
``killing breath,'' which is to say pure negative energy.
</P>
<P>
   The reason your lawn and garden is full of weeds and fire ant
hills is not because you're a lazy, good-for-nothing slob who would
rather lie on the sofa, drinking beer and watching senior golf on
TV than risk heat stroke in the great outdoors; it's because
neighbors _ possibly people you've never even met _ are peppering
you with Shar Chi-tipped arrows faster than you can say ``Cupid
this!''
</P>
<P>
   What you need to do, Too says, is blast the Shar Chi negative
energy back from whence it came with the help of your own feng shui
``cannon'' (available through Sears, $49.99).
</P>
<P>
   If you're afraid of guns or simply worry that aiming a feng shui
cannon at your neighbor's pool deck will simply make matters worse,
you might want to begin collecting Sheng Chi, or green
dragonbreath.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Shar Chi, which travels in straight, lethal lines, Sheng
Chi meanders all over the place, and wherever it accumulates, good
things happen.
</P>
<P>
   Good sources of Shar Chi are bright flowers, goldfish ponds
(presumably one in which the goldfish are not floating belly-up),
turtles, children and dogs.
</P>
<P>
   The thinking here, apparently, is that if you acquire all these
sources of Shar Chi you will be much too exhausted and/or broke to
notice whether someone is shooting poison arrows at you or not.
</P>
<P>
   Either that or it will lead to a Green Dragon's Breath war
between yourself and your neighbors, the resolution of which,
needless to say, will require the intervention of a high-priced
feng shui consultant such as myself.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BILL'S WORLD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Stability in Kosovo,'' says Mr. Clinton, ``depends upon a
durable political settlement.'' In Washington, too.
</P>
<P>
   A new national study shows viewers of local TV get most of their
political information from commercials. That's like relying on your
kid for information on why his grades are so bad.
</P>
<P>
   New figures show orders for big-ticket durable goods are higher
than economists expected. Are rich people stocking up on cars for
the winter?
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft court case continues. From what we can tell, it's
in the ``Connect: Looking up host'' stage.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reports that the highway death rate was at
``an all-time low last year.'' But we'd guess it was lower before
there were cars.
</P>
<P>
   Aunt Ilse from Oelwein says her least favorite proposal for
saving Social Security is to make senior citizens trick-or-treat
for money to live on.
</P>
<P>
   A group of historians says impeaching Mr. Clinton is a bad idea
that could leave the presidency ``permanently disfigured and
diminished.'' But not impeaching him might do the same.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Election Commission says Republicans have raised
much more money than Democrats have this year. Given the GOP hope
to get rid of Mr. Clinton, should we call this difference a
dismissal gap?
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole election still hangs in the balance,'' says the
president. And will unless someone can convince a few voters to
settle things Tuesday.

suddenly took up residence in its computer system. (Many employees
claim that one already has.)
</P>
<P>
   Feng shui, of course, is the traditional Chinese scam _ excuse
me, art _ of fiddling with one's living (or work) space so that all
is balanced, leading to happiness, health and wealth for feng shui
consultants like myself and, possibly, you, too.
</P>
<P>
   I argued, unsuccessfully, that the Herald-Tribune's feng shui
would be dramatically improved if management were relocated in our
cramped, dim, airless cubicles and the employees took over the
swank executive offices overlooking the McDonald's parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken me some time (three weeks probation) to recover
from that setback, but I'm now ready to impose my will (for a fat
fee, of course) on another feng shui-infested area, namely lawns
and gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Assisting me in this undertaking is a new book by feng shui guru
Lillian Too titled ``The Complete Illustrated Guide to Feng Shui
for Gardens'' (Element, $24.95.).
</P>
<P>
   Lawns and gardens are infested with feng shui, both of the good
and bad variety, Too said. The problem, of course, is knowing which
one you're dealing with, which is where the book comes in handy.
</P>
<P>
   According to the author, ``Identifying and dealing with poison
arrows that are present in the environment are an essential part of
feng shui practice.''
</P>
<P>
   While you may think that your lawn and garden is poison-arrow
free, there are a lot more out there than you might think.
</P>
<P>
   A poison arrow, Too says, is anything that is sharp, pointed,
straight or triangular, or that appears hostile or threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Using that definition, that might include a crack in your
driveway, sand spurs, a ``trespassers will be shot'' sign, your
neighbor's pit bull, or, simply, your neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Poison arrows are bad because they're made of Shar Chi or
``killing breath,'' which is to say pure negative energy.
</P>
<P>
   The reason your lawn and garden is full of weeds and fire ant
hills is not because you're a lazy, good-for-nothing slob who would
rather lie on the sofa, drinking beer and watching senior golf on
TV than risk heat stroke in the great outdoors; it's because
neighbors _ possibly people you've never even met _ are peppering
you with Shar Chi-tipped arrows faster than you can say ``Cupid
this!''
</P>
<P>
   What you need to do, Too says, is blast the Shar Chi negative
energy back from whence it came with the help of your own feng shui
``cannon'' (available through Sears, $49.99).
</P>
<P>
   If you're afraid of guns or simply worry that aiming a feng shui
cannon at your neighbor's pool deck will simply make matters worse,
you might want to begin collecting Sheng Chi, or green
dragonbreath.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Shar Chi, which travels in straight, lethal lines, Sheng
Chi meanders all over the place, and wherever it accumulates, good
things happen.
</P>
<P>
   Good sources of Shar Chi are bright flowers, goldfish ponds
(presumably one in which the goldfish are not floating belly-up),
turtles, children and dogs.
</P>
<P>
   The thinking here, apparently, is that if you acquire all these
sources of Shar Chi you will be much too exhausted and/or broke to
notice whether someone is shooting poison arrows at you or not.
</P>
<P>
   Either that or it will lead to a Green Dragon's Breath war
between yourself and your neighbors, the resolution of which,
needless to say, will require the intervention of a high-priced
feng shui consultant such as myself.

`OPRAH WINFREY PRESENTS: DAVID AND LISA': DULL TALE OF MENTAL
ILLNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(bl) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oprah Winfrey has played a big part in the emergence of our
tell-all culture, not with a lurid approach, but with a
truth-will-set-you-free attitude. From revelations of her own
sexually abused girlhood to the stream of guests who work toward
emotional health by confessing their problems on television, ``The
Oprah Winfrey Show'' has become a favorite site for talking cures.
</P>
<P>
   So it makes sense that the latest film in her ``Oprah Winfrey
Presents'' series is ``David and Lisa,'' a remake of the 1962 film
about two emotionally disturbed teen-agers who meet at an
institution and form a tentative, healing friendship. This new
version literally brings mental illness into the light.
</P>
<P>
   The original ``David and Lisa'' was shot in black-and-white so
extreme that it looked gothic. And though the film was a
sympathetic attempt to demystify mental illness, the melodramatic
music sounded like it belonged in a movie about institutional
horrors, like ``The Snake Pit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oprah Winfrey Presents: David and Lisa'' takes place in the
California sun. The institution where the teen-agers live is filled
with windows that let crystal light shine through. It shines
especially brightly in the immense office of the school's head, who
is played by Sidney Poitier and so deserves nothing less.
</P>
<P>
   But the visual openness is the only dramatic change in this dull
film, which turns out to be disappointingly like the old one. Such
a faithful rendering seems senseless because time has robbed the
story of its daring. Or maybe ``David and Lisa,'' with its
simplistic message about the healing touch of friendship, was
always waiting for the psychobabble '90s to catch up to it.
</P>
<P>
   The key to this film's approach comes in Ms. Winfrey's
introduction. ``Like David, sometimes we can get consumed by fears
and anxieties,'' she says, explaining why she wanted to produce
this story.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of his psychiatrist, David arrives at ``a place
where he can begin to feel and trust again.'' Like an extension of
the ``Oprah Winfrey Show,'' this is television as therapy.
</P>
<P>
   But David has more serious problems than what might be labeled
intimacy issues. ``Touch can kill,'' he yells, recoiling in terror
when he arrives at the school and another student accidentally
brushes his hand while trying to help with his luggage. His fear of
being touched physically seems an impossibly blunt '90s addition,
but it was there in the original, too.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas Haas does not glamorize David, with his lank hair,
buttoned-up shirts and gaunt, haunted face. David is so obsessed
with order and time that he spends his days making precise drawings
of the inner mechanisms of clocks.
</P>
<P>
   If David keeps everything in, Lisa (Brittany Murphy) lets
everything out. She swirls in circles and speaks in rhymes. ``Nag,
nag, dirty hag,'' she taunts her social worker, Maggie (Debi
Mazar). She is a shy, pretty girl, with a childlike innocence and
blooming sexuality that the film hints at.
</P>
<P>
   Individually, the actors inhabit David and Lisa convincingly,
yet together they fail to make the emotional connection on which
the entire story depends. Lloyd Kramer's direction is neither
mawkish nor tough; it is simply pedestrian.
</P>
<P>
   Poitier is used for his iconic presence here. He can exude
authority simply by standing, sitting or walking into a room, and
often that's what he's called on to do. At other times he is
saddled with the film's most babbly aphorisms, including, ``If you
don't feel in love with life, you are more dead than alive.''
</P>
<P>
   The film barely acknowledges the changes that have taken place
in the study of psychology in the last three decades. In one of the
rare instances when it does, the hyperintelligent David says Lisa
is ``disassociative'' and sneers at the idea that she might have
been diagnosed as schizophrenic. (In 1962, schizophrenia was
precisely the proud diagnosis David offered.)
</P>
<P>
   Poitier's character says he prefers simple language. ``People
have feelings,'' he tells David, who has just said he prefers
clocks to humans.
</P>
<P>
   As disappointing as ``David and Lisa'' is, it would be too bad
if it became ammunition in the growing Oprah backlash. The two
previous television films she produced, ``Before Women Had Wings''
and ``The Wedding,'' were among the most intelligent and finely
wrought network films of the past two years. Producing and starring
in ``Beloved'' was a serious artistic move and Oprah's Book Club is
an inspired idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``David and Lisa'' comes from the Oprah Winfrey who joins with
her audience in group therapy, which is not one of her better
roles.

 &HT;     MARTHA STEWART'S HALLOWEEN: REALLY SCARY 
 &HT;     By DIANE WHITE 
 &HT;     c.1998 The Boston Globe 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Tuesday's ``Martha Stewart Living'' Martha confessed that
she's one of those people who goes ``all out'' on Halloween. No
kidding. When doesn't she?
</P>
<P>
   Martha, true to form, was showing how she constructed a
jack-o'-lantern snake _ ``an interesting and terrifying
decoration'' _ to adorn her Halloween doorstep using nothing more
than 34 pumpkins in assorted sizes, a utility saw, an exacto knife,
a power drill with a borer attachment and three sets of sturdy
outdoor holiday lights. Oh, and a tool called a Pumpkin Eater, a
plastic scraper specifically designed for hollowing out pumpkins.
</P>
<P>
   It was the sort of simple project anyone might undertake if she
had nothing better to do than go out and buy 34 pumpkins, lug them
home, scrape out their insides and bore them full of holes. But why
34 pumpkins? Why not 35 or 36? Or 66? For that matter, why not 104?
It's just one of the many mysteries of Martha. Maybe it has
something to do with the expense of acquiring all those pumpkins,
although money seldom seems to be a consideration in Martha's
world, and why should it be? But she may figure that her viewers
would balk at buying more than 34. Those who have to buy them, that
is, those who haven't grown their own from last year's seeds, the
Martha Stewart way.
</P>
<P>
   I know some of you are thinking: There she goes again. Will she
never stop picking on Martha? Inevitably a reader or two will,
after reading this, write or call to accuse me of being insanely
jealous of Martha. If only it were that simple. I don't begrudge
Martha an iota of her success, because she's earned it. But 34
pumpkins? Is this, as Martha might say, a good thing?
</P>
<P>
   Lately, in the interest of my editor's sanity, I have resisted
the urge to write about Martha. I keep an eye on her though. It's
almost impossible not to. She's everywhere. There have been
occasions when I have been tempted to comment, for instance when
she advised her viewers how to arrange their outdoor woodpiles in
aesthetically appealing patterns. That was unbelievable. But it was
the pumpkins that drove me to this.
</P>
<P>
   There's something about pumpkins that seems to inspire Martha to
creative flights. In autumns past she's used them as soup bowls and
tureens, as cooking vessels, as vases, as doorstops, among other
things. This year, in the October issue of her magazine Martha
provides instructions for readers who wish to make preppy-looking
monogrammed pumpkins that might have rolled right out of a Talbot's
catalog, if Talbot's sold vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   But Martha's ultimate jack-o'-lantern challenge this year is
carving the Colonial Revival cameo pumpkins pictured on the cover
of the same issue. (``The mantel is the perfect place for two
glorious silhouette profiles fixed in a gaze.'') These are
18th-century-style profile silhouettes executed in squash, the kind
of thing anyone with an advanced degree in fine arts could knock
off in an evening or two.
</P>
<P>
   Attempting either the monograms or the cameos requires eight
tools, among them a linoleum cutter, a melon baller and a sabre
saw. Those of us who still attack the Halloween pumpkin with a
kitchen knife and our hands may well feel unworthy, unimaginative
and inadequate just reading the instructions for creating these
Martha-style jack-o'-lantern. Which may be the point.
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible Martha is putting us on with some of these
incredibly elaborate projects? Could the pumpkin snake, for
instance, be her idea of a joke? Is she sitting down there in
Westport, Conn. (``The Martha Stewart State'') at her fabulous
Turkey Hill estate chortling at the thought of her faithful
acolytes reaming out pumpkins by the dozen? I'd like to think so.
It's the only way I can bear it.

   Since I last wrote about feng shui (literally ``Bride of
Chucky'') earlier this year, I have been besieged (one letter) by
requests for a follow-up.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, as you probably don't recall, I appointed myself

kidding. When doesn't she?
</P>
<P>
   Martha, true to form, was showing how she constructed a
jack-o'-lantern snake _ ``an interesting and terrifying
decoration'' _ to adorn her Halloween doorstep using nothing more
than 34 pumpkins in assorted sizes, a utility saw, an exacto knife,
a power drill with a borer attachment and three sets of sturdy
outdoor holiday lights. Oh, and a tool called a Pumpkin Eater, a
plastic scraper specifically designed for hollowing out pumpkins.
</P>
<P>
   It was the sort of simple project anyone might undertake if she
had nothing better to do than go out and buy 34 pumpkins, lug them
home, scrape out their insides and bore them full of holes. But why
34 pumpkins? Why not 35 or 36? Or 66? For that matter, why not 104?
It's just one of the many mysteries of Martha. Maybe it has
something to do with the expense of acquiring all those pumpkins,
although money seldom seems to be a consideration in Martha's
world, and why should it be? But she may figure that her viewers
would balk at buying more than 34. Those who have to buy them, that
is, those who haven't grown their own from last year's seeds, the
Martha Stewart way.
</P>
<P>
   I know some of you are thinking: There she goes again. Will she
never stop picking on Martha? Inevitably a reader or two will,
after reading this, write or call to accuse me of being insanely
jealous of Martha. If only it were that simple. I don't begrudge
Martha an iota of her success, because she's earned it. But 34
pumpkins? Is this, as Martha might say, a good thing?
</P>
<P>
   Lately, in the interest of my editor's sanity, I have resisted
the urge to write about Martha. I keep an eye on her though. It's
almost impossible not to. She's everywhere. There have been
occasions when I have been tempted to comment, for instance when
she advised her viewers how to arrange their outdoor woodpiles in
aesthetically appealing patterns. That was unbelievable. But it was
the pumpkins that drove me to this.
</P>
<P>
   There's something about pumpkins that seems to inspire Martha to
creative flights. In autumns past she's used them as soup bowls and
tureens, as cooking vessels, as vases, as doorstops, among other
things. This year, in the October issue of her magazine Martha
provides instructions for readers who wish to make preppy-looking
monogrammed pumpkins that might have rolled right out of a Talbot's
catalog, if Talbot's sold vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   But Martha's ultimate jack-o'-lantern challenge this year is
carving the Colonial Revival cameo pumpkins pictured on the cover
of the same issue. (``The mantel is the perfect place for two
glorious silhouette profiles fixed in a gaze.'') These are
18th-century-style profile silhouettes executed in squash, the kind
of thing anyone with an advanced degree in fine arts could knock
off in an evening or two.
</P>
<P>
   Attempting either the monograms or the cameos requires eight
tools, among them a linoleum cutter, a melon baller and a sabre
saw. Those of us who still attack the Halloween pumpkin with a
kitchen knife and our hands may well feel unworthy, unimaginative
and inadequate just reading the instructions for creating these
Martha-style jack-o'-lantern. Which may be the point.
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible Martha is putting us on with some of these
incredibly elaborate projects? Could the pumpkin snake, for
instance, be her idea of a joke? Is she sitting down there in
Westport, Conn. (``The Martha Stewart State'') at her fabulous
Turkey Hill estate chortling at the thought of her faithful
acolytes reaming out pumpkins by the dozen? I'd like to think so.
It's the only way I can bear it.

   &UR; USE YOUR DRAGON BREATH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By DAVID GRIMES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Since I last wrote about feng shui (literally ``Bride of
Chucky'') earlier this year, I have been besieged (one letter) by
requests for a follow-up.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, as you probably don't recall, I appointed myself
official feng shui consultant for the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, a
building that couldn't have worse feng shui if a poltergeist
suddenly took up residence in its computer system. (Many employees
claim that one already has.)
</P>
<P>
   Feng shui, of course, is the traditional Chinese scam _ excuse
me, art _ of fiddling with one's living (or work) space so that all
is balanced, leading to happiness, health and wealth for feng shui
consultants like myself and, possibly, you, too.
</P>
<P>
   I argued, unsuccessfully, that the Herald-Tribune's feng shui
would be dramatically improved if management were relocated in our
cramped, dim, airless cubicles and the employees took over the
swank executive offices overlooking the McDonald's parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken me some time (three weeks probation) to recover
from that setback, but I'm now ready to impose my will (for a fat
fee, of course) on another feng shui-infested area, namely lawns
and gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Assisting me in this undertaking is a new book by feng shui guru
Lillian Too titled ``The Complete Illustrated Guide to Feng Shui
for Gardens'' (Element, $24.95.).
</P>
<P>
   Lawns and gardens are infested with feng shui, both of the good
and bad variety, Too said. The problem, of course, is knowing which
one you're dealing with, which is where the book comes in handy.
</P>
<P>
   According to the author, ``Identifying and dealing with poison
arrows that are present in the environment are an essential part of
feng shui practice.''
</P>
<P>
   While you may think that your lawn and garden is poison-arrow
free, there are a lot more out there than you might think.
</P>
<P>
   A poison arrow, Too says, is anything that is sharp, pointed,
straight or triangular, or that appears hostile or threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Using that definition, that might include a crack in your
driveway, sand spurs, a ``trespassers will be shot'' sign, your
neighbor's pit bull, or, simply, your neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Poison arrows are bad because they're made of Shar Chi or
``killing breath,'' which is to say pure negative energy.
</P>
<P>
   The reason your lawn and garden is full of weeds and fire ant
hills is not because you're a lazy, good-for-nothing slob who would
rather lie on the sofa, drinking beer and watching senior golf on
TV than risk heat stroke in the great outdoors; it's because
neighbors _ possibly people you've never even met _ are peppering
you with Shar Chi-tipped arrows faster than you can say ``Cupid
this!''
</P>
<P>
   What you need to do, Too says, is blast the Shar Chi negative
energy back from whence it came with the help of your own feng shui
``cannon'' (available through Sears, $49.99).
</P>
<P>
   If you're afraid of guns or simply worry that aiming a feng shui
cannon at your neighbor's pool deck will simply make matters worse,
you might want to begin collecting Sheng Chi, or green
dragonbreath.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Shar Chi, which travels in straight, lethal lines, Sheng
Chi meanders all over the place, and wherever it accumulates, good
things happen.
</P>
<P>
   Good sources of Shar Chi are bright flowers, goldfish ponds
(presumably one in which the goldfish are not floating belly-up),
turtles, children and dogs.
</P>
<P>
   The thinking here, apparently, is that if you acquire all these
sources of Shar Chi you will be much too exhausted and/or broke to
notice whether someone is shooting poison arrows at you or not.
</P>
<P>
   Either that or it will lead to a Green Dragon's Breath war
between yourself and your neighbors, the resolution of which,
needless to say, will require the intervention of a high-priced
feng shui consultant such as myself.
</P>

   &UR; BILL'S WORLD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Stability in Kosovo,'' says Mr. Clinton, ``depends upon a
durable political settlement.'' In Washington, too.
</P>
<P>
   A new national study shows viewers of local TV get most of their
political information from commercials. That's like relying on your
kid for information on why his grades are so bad.
</P>
<P>
   New figures show orders for big-ticket durable goods are higher
than economists expected. Are rich people stocking up on cars for
the winter?
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft court case continues. From what we can tell, it's
in the ``Connect: Looking up host'' stage.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reports that the highway death rate was at
``an all-time low last year.'' But we'd guess it was lower before
there were cars.
</P>
<P>
   Aunt Ilse from Oelwein says her least favorite proposal for
saving Social Security is to make senior citizens trick-or-treat
for money to live on.
</P>
<P>
   A group of historians says impeaching Mr. Clinton is a bad idea
that could leave the presidency ``permanently disfigured and
diminished.'' But not impeaching him might do the same.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Election Commission says Republicans have raised
much more money than Democrats have this year. Given the GOP hope
to get rid of Mr. Clinton, should we call this difference a
dismissal gap?
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole election still hangs in the balance,'' says the
president. And will unless someone can convince a few voters to
settle things Tuesday.

   Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or
noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York
City. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `ANTZ,' starring the voices of Woody Allen and Sharon Stone.
Directed by Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson (PG, 83 minutes). Computer
animation has advanced to the point where it can make a cute
romantic couple out of Allen and Ms. Stone. This and other surreal
tricks are shown off in a funny, ingeniously animated insect
picture that often reaches the anthropomorphic cleverness of ``Toy
Story'' and shows off Allen's sharpest comic timing with
one-liners. But ``Antz'' winds up overplotted in bizarrely
grandiose ways, with the threat of genocide invoked for a jarring
change of pace. Must every child-friendly adventure film, even one
with considerable potential to delight grown-ups, boil down to a
struggle for world domination? Surely a threat of bug spray in the
picnic basket would have done the trick. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `APT PUPIL,' directed by Bryan Singer. Starring Ian McKellen and
Brad Renfro (R, 100 minutes). Adapted from the Stephen King novella
collection that seems to have been written under a lucky star (it
also yielded ``Stand by Me'' and ``The Shawshank Redemption''),
this is a handsomely made film by the director of ``The Usual
Suspects,'' with some of the same misanthropic chill. But the
deftness with which Singer stages a war of nerves between an aged
Nazi and a cruelly inquisitive high school boy is more impressive
than the story itself, which loses much of its novelty as it goes
along. (Eventually, somebody is killed in a basement with a
shovel.) McKellen, who can also be seen playing a deeper role in
``Gods and Monsters,'' brings all his ingenuity to playing the
shrewd old war criminal, but there's nobody here to like. (Janet
Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `BELOVED,' starring Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover, Thandie Newton
and Kimberley Elise. Directed by Jonathan Demme (R, 172 minutes). A
transfixing, deeply felt adaptation of Toni Morrison's novel, with
all the complexity (and occasional opacity) that entails. Taking on
the most enticing yet daunting job of literary adaptation since
``The English Patient,'' Jonathan Demme succeeds in bringing the
novel's pulse to the screen. Though it begins too slowly and
literally, this daring effort escalates into a gripping,
imaginative film that mixes memories of slavery with the occult and
that isn't quite like any other. Its linchpin, Ms. Winfrey, is more
often a person acting than an intuitive actress. But she plays her
character, a onetime slave literally haunted by her past, with
enough presence to hold the film together. The other major
performances are extraordinary, especially Ms. Newton's in the
bizarre title role. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `THE CELEBRATION,' directed by Thomas Vinterberg (R, 100
minutes). Working under a set of self-imposed restrictions that are
meant to return filmmaking to a fundamental honesty, this Danish
director shows off dazzling ingenuity. The story of a family
reunion that becomes a black-tie, psyche-bashing blowout is told
with a hand-held camera, without any special lighting or props or
sound, and the effect is invigorating rather than austere.
Imaginative angles, nimble editing and fluid, agile camera work
keep the film spinning as a large Danish cast makes the festivities
seem utterly real. The central drama is Shakespeare for the
tell-all age, as a patriarch is haunted by past sins and vengeful
children. ``It is quite a job being toastmaster tonight,'' says one
partygoer, putting it mildly. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `THE CRUISE,' starring Timothy (Speed) Levitch. Directed and
produced by Bennett Miller (not rated; 76 minutes). Levitch, the
loquacious subject of Miller's fascinating documentary, is a
Manhattan tour-bus guide who happens also to be a sidewalk
philosopher, improvisatory poet and walking encyclopedia of New
York City history. More than anything, he is a free spirit.
Although he can be irritating at times, Levitch is a true original,
an erudite, intellectual version of a classic motor-mouthed New
York cabby. As he interweaves his personal story between spiels
about New York City landmarks, the city (beautifully photographed
in black and white) seems to come as alive as the man who is
describing it. (Stephen Holden)
</P>
<P>
   `EVEREST,' directed by David Brashears with Greg MacGillivray
(not rated; 45 minutes). If life in New York City doesn't provide
enough in the way of thrills, those in search of a vicarious
near-death experience can make their way to the Sony Imax Theater
at Lincoln Square (1998 Broadway, at 68th Street) for a go at
``Everest.'' There, images of the world's highest mountain _ 29,028
feet _ find a frame worthy of the peak's spectacular, lethal
beauty: the eight-story-high, 100-foot-wide screen. This account
focuses mainly on the efforts of three people to scale the peak in
1996 despite yawning chasms of ever shifting ice, thundering
avalanches, the perils of air so thin that it addles the brain and
sudden, blinding storms. While this expedition was on the mountain,
as many articles and books were later to relate, other teams made
their way into the so-called death zone, at 25,000 feet, where a
violent storm overtook them. Eight people perished in the worst
single disaster on the mountain. ``Everest'' makes it possible for
armchair adventurers to share the risks and glory of the team's
climb toward heaven. (Lawrence Van Gelder)
</P>
<P>
   `HAPPINESS,' starring Jane Adams and Dylan Baker. Directed by
Todd Solondz (not rated; 135 minutes). In a much bigger film than
his ``Welcome to the Doll House,'' this audacious, deadpan
filmmaker explores loneliness in his murderously funny fashion.
Outrageous touches _ none more so than its title _ come easily to
``Happiness,'' and so do the dark secrets that would surely have
brought it an NC-17 rating. No point in cataloging this film's
perverse details: What emerges most clearly is a ruthless yet
tender portrait of suburban characters seeking romance, captured
with enough acid precision to make this a ``Bob and Carol and Ted
and Alice'' for totally dysfunctional times. Ms. Adams plays the
dartboard in a three-sister family with hilarious tremulousness.
Baker's gutsy portrayal of a bland-seeming pederast who is also a
respected doctor and a loving father is impossible to forget.
(Janet Maslin)

<P>
   `HOLY MAN,' starring Eddie Murphy, Jeff Goldblum and Kelly
Preston. Directed by Stephen Herek (PG, 113 minutes). For all the
funny possibilities of Murphy's transforming himself into a bald,
beatific sage, this comedy doesn't know what to do with him.
Especially when it drags him into a spoof of home-shopping sales
pitches on television, the barn-size target that achieves satire so
nicely by itself. After enjoying Murphy's guru shtick at first, the
film reduces him to a mere catalyst in the cubic zirconium between
Goldblum and Ms. Preston, as two slick television executives.
Dopey, smutty double-entendres don't make it any funnier. (Janet
Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL,' directed by and starring Roberto Benigni
(PG-13, 122 minutes). Italy's most antic funnyman dares to find
humor and tenderness in the midst of the Holocaust, and his risk
pays off. This Cannes prize-winner is as stubbornly entertaining as
its central character, a Jewish waiter named Guido who jokes his
way through the nightmare for the sake of his loved ones. Daring
also to combine an opening hour of romance and pranks with a more
somber second act, Benigni avoids all traces of the maudlin and
effectively creates a situation in which comedy is courage. In this
unpretentious, enormously likable film, he shines as a father whose
fibs and hilarious buffoonery know no bounds, and no fear. (Janet
Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `LOLITA,' starring Jeremy Irons and Dominique Swain. Directed by
Adrian Lyne (R, 137 minutes). At last, Lyne's fine, deeply felt
adaptation of Nabokov's diabolical masterpiece can be seen in the
large-screen format it truly deserves. Why go out? Because the
detail and texture of this lavishly produced film shine
theatrically in ways that weren't possible on Showtime, and because
the film's mostly unalloyed subtlety (except in its opening and
closing sections) rewards a closer view. Lyne's direction is the
best work of his career. Irons' splendid performance conveys a
tragicomic blend of ardor and conscience, while Ms. Swain plays the
title role as a startlingly unpredictable adult-child hybrid. For a
culture so dangerously obsessed with youth and beauty, this
haunting ``Lolita'' is a fascinating sign of its times. (Janet
Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `THE MIGHTY,' starring Elden Hensen, Kieran Culkin and Sharon
Stone. Directed by Peter Chelsom (PG-13, 107 minutes). Though the
young adult novel ``Freak the Mighty'' has been renamed for a more
inspirational effect on screen, it remains mostly a story for the
age group that would find ``freak'' the most enticing word in the
title. Two young actors play appealing misfits who form a fanciful,
symbiotic bond full of Arthurian daydreams. Ms. Stone, in
just-folks mufti, plays one boy's down-to-earth mom as earnestly as
she can. Extraneous melodrama features Gillian Anderson, Meat Loaf
and James Gandolfini. The director of ``Hear My Song'' and ``Funny
Bones'' makes his first American film without quite as much
beguiling whimsy as those earlier films displayed. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `NEXT STOP WONDERLAND,' starring Hope Davis and Alan Gelfant.
Directed by Brad Anderson (R, 111 minutes). Will Erin (Ms. Davis),
an attractive, introspective night-shift nurse, and Alan (
Gelfant), a plumber and aspiring marine biologist who was obviously
meant for her, collide on the streets of Boston and live happily
ever after? The setup of this romantic comedy about dating in the
'90s may seem cliched, but the witty, beautifully acted and edited
film refreshes the genre with the acuteness of Anderson's
observations about people and middle-class urban life in general.
Ms. Davis creates a wonderfully complex portrait of an idealistic
introvert coping with loneliness, disappointment and pressures from
all sides, including (in the movie's funniest scenes) some ardently
self-centered suitors who answer a personal ad. A rich Brazilian
bossa-nova score gives the movie the mood of bittersweet longing.
(Stephen Holden)
</P>
<P>
   `ONE TRUE THING,' starring Meryl Streep, Renee Zellweger and
William Hurt. Directed by Carl Franklin (PG-13, 120 minutes). This
film adaptation of the novel by Anna Quindlen _ a former columnist
for The New York Times _ about an ambitious New York journalist
forced to move back in with her parents to care for her dying
mother strikes a sad and universal chord. And Ms. Streep and Ms.
Zellweger are beautifully matched as a mother and daughter who
achieve a grown-up understanding during this anguished time. But
the movie treads the line between soap opera and serious drama and
has far too many cute and sentimental touches. Its structure _ the
story is told in flashbacks that make the mother's death a kind of
whodunit (she dies from an overdose of morphine) _ also cheapens
the movie without ruining it. (Stephen Holden)
</P>
<P>
   `PECKER,' starring Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci. Directed
by John Waters (R, 87 minutes). Waters, the Trash King of
Baltimore, does his best to puncture New York art-world pretensions
in a film whose biggest joke is its title, though plenty of winking
smaller jokes are here, too. ``Flavor of Month Causes Tizzy in Art
World'' reads a headline summarizing the career of the title
character, a Baltimore shutterbug who just won't quit snapping
friends and neighbors. In the film, fame and fortune threaten
Pecker's trashy esthetic and gross-out chic. Waters' own style
hasn't had to sacrifice these at all. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `PLEASANTVILLE,' starring Tobey Maguire, Reese Witherspoon, Joan
Allen, William Macy and Jeff Daniels. Directed by Gary Ross (PG-13,
116 minutes). This cleverly executed fantasy, with a
back-to-the-future trip into the small-town, squeaky-clean paradise
of a 1950s television show, tends toward the black-and-white,
visually and otherwise. The missionary zeal with which teen-agers
from the '90s try to awaken benighted '50s types from their slumber
is an attitude that wears thin. But in the meantime there are witty
tricks integrating color into black-and-white images, and nice
little touches abound. The cast is both poignant and amusing, with
Ms. Allen especially touching as a pre-feminist housewife who's the
prime recipient of '90s hindsight. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `PRACTICAL MAGIC,' starring Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman.
Directed by Griffin Dunne (PG-13, 105 minutes). A new look for
Halloween: super-cute. In a bouncy, bubble-brained movie with the
look of a shelter magazine, it's Barbie Joins a Coven time as the
stars shake long flossy hair and play witch sisters. They flounce
through a story (based on Alice Hoffman's fanciful novel) in which
magic is for dealing with menfolk, and brooms look all too cozily
at home. Fatuous and retrograde as this is, it's also guilty fun,
especially when Dianne Wiest and Stockard Channing are on hand to
play the senior witches of this family. Aidan Quinn plays clean-cut
Right without casting a spell. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `RONIN,' starring Robert De Niro, Jean Reno, Stellan Skarsgaard,
Natascha McElhone and Jonathan Pryce. Directed by John
Frankenheimer (R, 121 minutes). Directing like a world-weary
Hitchcock with a taste for the breathless car chase, Frankenheimer
propels this tale of intrigue through its tightly plotted paces so
expertly that he even makes an action hero of De Niro. European in
both its brooding tone and beautiful French settings, this story of
double-dealing mercenaries in pursuit of a metal suitcase features
a tough, expert cast and some sensational action sequences.
Frankenheimer directs them in fast, efficient, no-frills fashion
because no extra frills are needed. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `SAVING PRIVATE RYAN,' starring Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Tom
Sizemore, Jeremy Davies and Edward Burns. Directed by Steven
Spielberg (R, 168 minutes). Spielberg's soberly magnificent new
film is the finest war movie of our time. Turning back the clock to
restore passion and meaning to the genre, he works in a spirit of
urgent communication to look at war as if it has not been looked at
before. Tour-de-force battle scenes are frank without
sensationalism, and the same great storyteller who made you believe
there was an extraterrestrial hiding in the closet has made this an
irresistibly vibrant, gripping tale. Hanks continues to astonish
with admirable modesty, and the rest of the casting is comparably
inspired. As he did with ``Schindler's List,'' Spielberg has made a
landmark film of devastating power. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `SOLDIER,' starring Kurt Russell, Jason Scott Lee and Connie
Nielsen. Directed by Paul Anderson. (R, 99 minutes). Playing a
grim, futuristic human killing machine named Todd who becomes
obsolete when a new, better model of soldier is introduced, Russell
has little to do but glare and mouth a few robotic phrases in this
dreary science-fiction adventure film. When Todd is dumped on a
planet whose inhabitants are a bunch of hardy, peaceable refugees
from a crashed spaceship, ``Soldier'' becomes as mushy and
preposterous as ``The Postman.'' The last third is devoted to
tedious battle sequences as Todd disposes of the new breed of
soldiers and faces off with their glowering leader ( Lee). (Stephen
Holden)
</P>
<P>
   `A SOLDIER'S DAUGHTER NEVER CRIES,' starring Leelee Sobieski,
Kris Kristofferson and Barbara Hershey. Directed by James Ivory (R,
120 minutes). Working without a classic at hand, the Merchant-Ivory
team adapts a novel by Kaylie Jones, James Jones' daughter, into a
colorful panorama weakened by autobiographical sprawl. With no real
narrative shapeliness and a loosely anecdotal pace, it vividly
recalls the coming of age of a sensitive young woman who (though
well played by 14-year-old Ms. Sobieski) remains a more slender,
peripheral figure than the film's ambitions require. Moving from
Paris to America, it succeeds more at evoking detail and atmosphere
than in finding the heart of her story. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `T-REX: BACK TO THE CRETACEOUS,' starring Peter Horton and Liz
Stauber. Directed by Brett Leonard (not rated; 45 minutes).
Passions for the prehistoric that remain unsated after the two
``Jurassic Park'' films are likely to be requited by this latest
Imax 3-D film. Drooling and menacing, the monsters of the Mesozoic
are on the march again in this brief, enjoyable dip into
paleontology, teen-age adventure and parent-child relationships.
Seen in 3-D and set against the lush ferns, moss and ancient trees
of the Olympic rain forest in the state of Washington, these
creatures seem marvelously lifelike. Better yet, ``T-Rex,''
directed by Leonard and written by Andrew Gellis and Jeanne
Rosenberg, doesn't rest on its technological splendors. Its
time-tripping story takes the viewer to a paleontological dig,
raises unanswered scientific questions and introduces some of the
major figures in the history of the subject. To be sure, seeing
``T-Rex'' won't qualify anyone for a doctorate in paleontology, and
an intriguing subplot that hints at a troubled family background
for its teen-age heroine is left unresolved; but the film is the
sort likely to whet active young minds to know more about the past.
At Sony Theaters Lincoln Square, 1998 Broadway, at 68th Street.

   `THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY,' starring Cameron Diaz, Ben
Stiller and Matt Dillon. Directed by Peter and Bobby Farrelly (R,
119 minutes). Sometimes Western civilization declines in
deliriously funny style. Hence this proudly obnoxious comedy is a
hoot in every sense, deserving a smidgen of disapproval and a whole
lot of helpless laughter. Set in motion by a prom, a crush and a
cruel, cruel zipper, this paean to low humor works ridiculously
well because it never stoops to being mean-spirited or (despite all
appearances) authentically inane. The principal cast is bright and
appealing, with Ms. Diaz at her most beautiful and blithe. Do note
that this film strives hard for something to offend everyone, and
that a tolerance for zit jokes is unfortunately required. (Janet
Maslin)

<P>
   `WHAT DREAMS MAY COME,' starring Robin Williams, Cuba Gooding
Jr. and Annabella Sciorra. Directed by Vincent Ward (R, 106
minutes). If the Gothic-romantic special effects in this turgid pop
fable set in the afterlife are some of the trippiest ever devised
for a serious drama, this sudsy fantasy about married soul mates
who meet after death never comes emotionally alive. Williams is at
his fake-sincere worst as the world's most devoted husband who dies
in a car crash and goes to heaven. Ms. Sciorra is simply blank as
the wife who commits suicide and must be rescued from hell.
Gooding, glaringly miscast, plays Williams' angelic guide. (Stephen
Holden).

NFL MATCHUPS: WEEK 9  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BYE WEEK: Bears, Chargers.
</P>
<P>
   GAME OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins (5-2) at Bills (4-3)
</P>
<P>
   Key stat: 3 of last 4 decided by 7 points or less.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The Doug Flutie bandwagon is so full that people are
falling off the back. It's like the NFL has never seen a mobile
quarterback before. Oh, the league has, over a decade ago, and it
was, well, Flutie, before he was banished to the Canadian Football
League. Flutie is 11-5 as an NFL starter and his quick feet and
improvisation has made him a formidable quarterback. But the
Dolphins have something many other teams don't: a fast defense.
When Flutie starts all that scrambling, he'll have five Dolphins in
his face. Miami wins because its defense, which allows a league-low
11.3 points a game, shuts down the little man.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins, 14-9.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY 1 P.M. GAMES
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals (3-4) at Lions (2-5)
</P>
<P>
   Key stat: Bobby Ross, 2-0 against Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: It turns out Arizona defensive tackle Eric Swann has
been playing with a sore knee all season, and while teammates say
they appreciate his bravery, it was hurting the team because his
play hasn't been up to snuff. But even a hobbled Swann, no matter
what Cardinals players maintain, is better than half of the
defensive linemen in the league. Without him helping to clog up the
middle, Barry Sanders runs wild.
</P>
<P>
   Lions, 21-14.
</P>
<P>
   Broncos (7-0) at Bengals (2-5)
</P>
<P>
   Key stat: Elway, 99.6 rating.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Denver is just one big, fat steamroller, and no team
can stop them _ except the Bengals. Yes, the Broncos have the best
running back in football right now in Terrell Davis (1,001 yards),
they top the conference in possession time with an astounding 32
minutes and 33 seconds and they average 6.58 yards on first down.
They look unbeatable. But Denver sounds a little too full of
themselves. They are talking about an undefeated season and the
Bengals are an afterthought. Quarterback Neil O'Donnell has not
been intercepted in his past 172 attempts, wide receiver Carl
Pickens has two 100-yard games against Denver and defensive end
Clyde Simmons has six sacks against the Broncos, the most against
any AFC team. This is the upset of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Bengals, 30-28.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguars (5-2) at Ravens (2-5)
</P>
<P>
   Key stat: Rod Woodson, 4 interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The Ravens face their third straight playoff team from
last year _ Pittsburgh, Green Bay and now Jacksonville. This is
Baltimore's last chance to get something started, or the playoffs
become a dream. Jacksonville Coach Tom Coughlin is 5-0 against Ted
Marchibroda, the Ravens' coach. He can't keep beating Marchibroda
forever. Jim Harbaugh gets the start and that will help steady the
ship.
</P>
<P>
   Ravens, 24-10.
</P>
<P>
   Vikings (7-0) at Buccaneers (3-4)
</P>
<P>
   Key stat: Vikings' offense, 380.9 yards a game.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Only five teams have reached the 8-0 mark since the
NFL went to the 16-game schedule in 1978 and like the Broncos, the
Vikings look unstoppable. But unlike the Broncos, the Vikings won't
lose this week. Lost in the fireworks that is Air Minnesota is the
fact that the Vikings' defense has held up pretty well this year.
Minnesota leads the conference with a plus-seven turnover ratio and
the league with 13 interceptions (they had 12 all of last season).
Trent Dilfer is a deer lost in the headlights.
</P>
<P>
   Vikings, 21-0.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots (4-3) at Colts (1-6)
</P>
<P>
   Key stat: Bledsoe, 8-2 vs. Colts.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: In his last four games against the Colts, New England
quarterback Drew Bledsoe has a 111.4 rating with nine touchdowns
and no interceptions. So with the Colts owning one of the worst
defenses in the league giving up 363 yards a game, he should have
another field day. It's a good thing Indianapolis came along on the
schedule for the Patriots because they have been struggling. One
piece of good news for the Colts: Peyton Manning is quickly
becoming a good quarterback. He picked apart San Francisco two
weeks ago and because he's playing well the Colts will only lose by
two touchdowns instead of three.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots, 38-24.
</P>
<P>
   Saints (4-3) at Panthers (0-7)
</P>
<P>
   Key stat: Panthers, -6 on takeaways.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The Saints are winning for one reasons: they have
played a lot of bad teams. The latest sorry bunch on their schedule
are the winless Panthers, a team that is one of the most
injury-plagued in the league this year. Defensive coordinator Zaven
Yaralian has done a wonderful job with the Saints. His defense
constantly puts pressure on quarterbacks and the Saints have a sack
in 56 straight games (NFL record is 60 by Washington) and 11
interceptions. Meanwhile, the Panthers are simply cursed. You know
the season is going south when Jason Peter, the team's No. 1 draft
pick, breaks his hand punching a teammate in the head during a
fight. Of course, the teammate was wearing a helmet.
</P>
<P>
   Saints, 17-12.
</P>
<P>
   Giants (3-4) at Redskins (0-7)
</P>
<P>
   Key stat: Turner, 2-6-1 against Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Giants' coach Jim Fassel has done a great job of
keeping the team from fracturing into a million pieces during the
early season struggles. But if the Giants make the playoffs, he
should send a bouquet to his defensive coordinator, John Fox.
Because of his schemes and energy, the Giants have 30 sacks, second
in the NFL behind the 49ers (31). The team's front four have 22
sacks, more than or equal to 21 teams. The Redskins continue their
revolving quarterbacks. In the hot seat this week: Trent Green. He
gets sacked at least three times.
</P>
<P>
   Giants, 24-14.
</P>
<P>
   Rams (2-3) at Falcons (5-2)
</P>
<P>
   Key stat: Tony Martin, 502 yards receiving.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Falcons quarterback Chris Chandler has been practicing
this week, which is good news for Atlanta. The Steve DeBerg story
was nice, but it is unrealistic to ask a 44-year-old quarterback to
play professional football. No reason to think the Falcons won't
lose this game because they beat up on the weak teams in the league
and the Rams are on the verge of falling apart. Atlanta wins big
and the clock is ticking on Rams Coach Dick Vermeil, who some in
the league are beginning to think will leave the game after this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons, 35-13.
</P>
<P>
   Oilers (3-4) at Steelers (5-2)
</P>
<P>
   Key stat: Cowher, 32-13 vs. AFC Central
</P>
<P>
   Comments: All you hear in Pittsburgh is that the Steelers can't
score. All teams wish they had Pittsburgh's problems because for
all their headaches they still have five wins. The key to
Pittsburgh is running back Jerome Bettis, who has 532 yards on 129
carries. He has been slowed by a knee injury but is finally
healthy. He'll have a big game.
</P>
<P>
   Steelers, 21-17.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY 4 P.M. GAMES
</P>
<P>
   Jets (4-3) at Chiefs (4-3)
</P>
<P>
   Key stat: Derrick Thomas, 7 sacks.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The bad news for the Jets was what happened to the
Chiefs against Pittsburgh on Monday night. Kansas City played so
poorly, it's hard to imagine the Chiefs playing that bad again at
home. In walks the Jets into a bear trap. But I like the Jets here,
simply because the Chiefs are overrated and the Jets have a special
feel about them. The Jets aren't the kind of team that is
intimidated by playing in front of a hostile crowd, either.
Besides, if the Steelers can score 20 points, the Jets can score
more.
</P>
<P>
   Jets, 31-21.
</P>
<P>
   49ers (6-1) at Packers (5-2)
</P>
<P>
   Key stat: Packers winners of last 4 against 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Steve Young leads the NFL in attempts (270),
completions (165), yards (2,249), and touchdown passes (20). But
many of those stats have come against opponents like New Orleans,
Indianapolis and St. Louis. And the Packers love beating up on the
49ers. Quarterback Brett Favre has struggled in recent weeks but
has a career 114 rating against San Francisco. He'll straighten out
his game this Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Packers, 35-30.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Raiders (5-2) at Seahawks (4-3)
</P>
<P>
   Key stats: Raiders defense, 249.6 yards a game.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Oakland is the surprise team of the year and much of
the credit goes to defensive coordinator Willie Shaw. The Raiders
have the top-ranked defense in terms of yards allowed per game when
just last year they were the worst in that category. If the Raiders
continue to lead the league, they would be the only team since the
merger to go from worst to first. The Seahawks have solid offensive
weapons, but they're too helter-skelter to win.
</P>
<P>
   Raiders, 21-18.
</P>
<P>
   MONDAY NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys (4-3) at Eagles (1-6)
</P>
<P>
   Key stats: Cowboys, 7-2 after bye weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Philadelphia always seems to play Dallas tough, no
matter the circumstances. The Eagles are struggling and they have
never been worse under Ray Rhodes, but somehow he'll have his
players ready. Under Rhodes, the Eagles are 6-3 after bye weeks and
Cowboys' quarterback Troy Aikman has thrown 15 interceptions and
has been sacked 42 times by the Eagles, his highest such numbers
against any team. Meanwhile, look for quarterback Rodney Peete to
have a solid game. One intangible factor: the rowdy Veterans
Stadium crowd which loves to gives the Cowboys a hard time.
</P>
<P>
   Eagles, 12-10.

LOSSES WIPE OUT DEUTSCHE BANK'S 3RD-QUARTER PROFIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Deutsche Bank AG, Germany's biggest bank,
said Thursday that huge trading losses in the securities of
emerging markets, primarily Russia, had virtually obliterated its
third-quarter profit.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank said its net income for the quarter that ended on
Sept. 30 plunged 83.5 percent, to 147 million marks, or $89
million, compared with 890 million marks, or $539 million, in the
quarter a year earlier. Operating profit fell 95 percent, to 69
million marks, or $42 million, down from 1.3 billion marks, or $787
million. The bank had a big one-time gain from a special dividend
on Daimler-Benz stock, of which Deutsche Bank holds 21.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The bank, which is based in Frankfurt, said that trading
activities had earned a record 2.5 billion marks in the first half
of the year only to run up a loss of 224 million marks, or $136
million, in the third quarter. In addition, the bank set aside 300
million marks, or $182 million, for bad Russian loans.
</P>
<P>
   Though analysts had known that Russian problems would take a
huge bite out of Deutsche Bank profits, the results were even worse
than the two-thirds drop they had expected and did little to
relieve the gloom that hovers over large banks in both Europe and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's two other big international banks, Dresdner Bank and
Commerzbank, are expected to post big declines in profit when they
report their results next week. Bankers Trust, the New York
financial group that has been reported to be a takeover target of
Deutsche Bank, reported an even bigger loss, $350 million, from
securities trading in the third quarter. UBS and Credit Suisse of
Switzerland have acknowledged losing hundreds of millions of
dollars in Russia, and most analysts expect more losses to come.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank's stock, which like many other money-center banks
has lost nearly half its value in the last few months, rose 2.2
marks Thursday, to 102.95 a share. Analysts said the market
reaction showed that most investors had expected a steep decline in
profits and were not shocked by the latest numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The real question is whether profits will sink in the bank's
basic lines of business because of a sustained decline in world
economic growth and in the global security markets.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank has been trying to cut costs to bring its overall
returns closer to the norm of U.S. banks, but some analysts worry
that those efforts may not be enough if an economic downturn begins
to eat away at revenue from interest income, investment banking or
asset management.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the problems, Deutsche Bank has avoided some of the
spectacular problems that have beset other banks. UBS, and to a
lesser extent Credit Suisse and Dresdner, all lost money through
investments in Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund in
Greenwich, Conn., that had to be rescued with a $3.5 billion
bailout from creditor banks. Deutsche Bank has said that it has no
exposure to Long-Term Credit, though it joined the bailout in the
interest of averting a broader financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank and the other German banks have also been more
cautious than others about risks from Russian loans. Though the
German banks are the world's biggest lenders to Russia, most of
those loans are guaranteed by the German government, and the banks
have covered about half of the remaining risk through previous
loan-loss provisions.
</P>
<P>
   That does not resolve all the problems, however. Mark Hoge,
banking analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in London, said
Thursday that Deutsche Bank and other German banks remained
threatened by a general downturn in the financial markets _ a move
that would probably reduce interest income, investment banking
commissions and revenue from asset-management activities like
mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Though Deutsche Bank has vowed to cut costs enough to bolster
profits, its costs in the most recent quarter climbed by 6 percent.
In the event of a continued downturn, some analysts say that the
bank is likely to fall short of its promises even if it does
achieve its targets on cost-cutting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The targets that these banks had were based on the belief that
the income they had last year will be sustainable next year,'' Hoge
said. ``My concern is that we are at the beginning of a point where
income will be under pressure for a long time.''

SINGAPORE'S ECONOMY SHOWS EFFECT OF ASIAN TURMOIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Singapore, one of Asia's most resilient economies,
has succumbed to the region's economic turmoil. Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong said Thursday that the city-state's economy contracted in
the third quarter by an estimated 1.5 percent. It was the first
quarter of reduced output recorded in Singapore since the
mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Goh attributed the downturn to external pressures: Singapore's
exports to its Asian neighbors have plummeted, and there has been a
global downturn in the electronics industry, one of Singapore's
linchpins. ``Every now and then, a people is faced with a crucial
test,'' Goh said in a speech to labor leaders Thursday. ``We are
now faced with such a test.''
</P>
<P>
   Most economists had predicted that Singapore would not escape
the effects of the economic crisis, which has struck Thailand,
South Korea, Indonesia and even Hong Kong, among others. In
particular, they noted that Singapore was situated between two
sickly economies, those of Indonesia and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   With the contraction expected to continue this quarter,
Singapore seems likely to fall into a recession, which is defined
as two consecutive quarters of negative economic output. But most
analysts predicted that Singapore would eke out slight positive
growth for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the decline in output, unemployment is rising in
Singapore. The government said the jobless rate reached 4.5 percent
in September, compared with 2.3 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Thursday's bad news, analysts have generally praised
Singapore's handling of the Asian crisis. It allowed its currency,
the Singapore dollar, to decline in value in line with currencies
in nearby countries. And unlike Hong Kong, where authorities have
tried to prop up the real-estate and stock markets, Singapore has
allowed both markets to fall.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Singapore had also moved to liberalize its
financial markets, unlike Malaysia, which imposed Draconian capital
controls.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, Goh acknowledged that Singapore would have to take
more bitter medicine to rebound from the slump. Among other things,
he said, it needed to reduce the cost of business by cutting wages.
</P>
<P>
   Political experts said Singapore must also pay attention to
simmering unrest in Malaysia and Indonesia. While Singapore is
politically stable, it has been the target of hostile words from
both the Indonesian president, B.J. Habibie, and the Malaysian
prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad.

CLINTON JOINS THRONG AT LAUNCH OF GLENN, DISCOVERY ASTRONAUTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ An excited President Clinton joined a
nostalgic America Thursday in watching pioneer astronaut John Glenn
return to orbit aboard the space shuttle Discovery.
</P>
<P>
   But in a mark of the changing times since Glenn's Cold War
adventure 36 years ago, Clinton embraced continued U.S. financial
support to Russia, America's former space nemesis, to keep it as a
partner in building the space station.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like a kid at his first Christmas,'' Clinton said.
``I'm very excited about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was the first president to watch a launch since Richard
Nixon came here for the liftoff of Apollo 12 in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, who once
longed to become an astronaut, the president stood atop NASA's
launch control center roof with binoculars to watch the thunderous
blastoff that propelled Glenn and his six crewmates into space.
</P>
<P>
   The deafening roar of the rockets and the trembling sound waves
left the Clintons speechless for a minute after the launch. They
then joined the crowds in cheering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely thrilled,'' the president said. ``Amazing,'' added
the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   For Glenn, 77 and retiring as the Democratic senator from Ohio,
the trip comes more than three decades after he became the first
man to orbit the Earth during the space race with the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The president said Glenn, who he called a friend and a hero, had
``earned this chance'' for a second spaceflight. Clinton said he
had no role in the decision to make Glenn a member of the crew.
</P>
<P>
   During a CNN interview, Clinton said he supports continued
subsidies to Russia which, because of its financial problems,
cannot meet the timeline for completing construction of space
station parts. Russia is one of 15 nations helping the United
States construct the $40 billion orbiting space laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were required now to help the Russians during this
difficult period _ which will not last forever _ so that they could
continue to participate, I would be in favor of that,'' Clinton
said. ``I think it's very important that we have the Europeans, the
Japanese, the Canadians and the Russians in the space station
venture.''
</P>
<P>
   NASA has asked for $150 million annually for four years to help
the beleaguered Russian space program. However, Rep. James
Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., chairman of the House Space Committee, has
said will urge Congress next year to halt all subsidies to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Sensenbrenner introduced legislation this month to stop payments
to Russia and to cap the U.S. costs of the station to $21.9
billion. NASA recently raised its estimate of space station costs
to $21.7 billion from $17 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton brought several members of Congress along on Air Force
One to watch the flight, including Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee,
D-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Lee said tears came to her eyes as the shuttle lifted
off, partly because the flight had revitalized public interest in
the space program.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a picture perfect launch that fully captured the
importance of the American space program in all its glory,'' the
congresswoman said. ``The intellect, the can-do spirit of the
employees and the astronauts is all reflected in the ability to
overcome adversity and reach ultimate success.''
</P>
<P>
   After Discovery was safely aloft, Hillary Clinton said watching
the liftoff was ``an experience of a lifetime'' and she recalled
how as a youth she applied to NASA but was told women were not
accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot tell you how overwhelmed with emotion I am,'' she
told the 300 members of the launch staff at the traditional
post-liftoff lunch of beans and cornbread.
</P>
<P>
   ``As many times as I've seen a launch on television or even on a
big IMAX screen in some theater it cannot compare to the real
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exactly what is best about our country. It couldn't
happen anywhere else in the world,'' the first lady said. ``There
were voices who said we don't need to do this. And those are the
same voices that would have told Columbus `stay home, there's
nothing on the other side of all that water.' We need to keep that
spirit of adventure alive. That is part of what makes us Americans,
that is part of what we are about.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, the president and first lady flew to Palm Beach where
they appeared at a pair of fund-raisers for Democratic candidates. &QL;

YELTSIN TO APPOINT PANEL ON CONSTITUTION CHANGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ As President Boris Yeltsin prepares to fly to a Black
Sea resort on Friday on an extended sick leave, a Kremlin spokesman
said Thursday that he would soon appoint a panel of legal experts
to review changes to the Russian Constitution, including the
creation of a post for a vice president and successor.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, 67, has already stepped back from the day-to-day
business of running the country _ a fact officially confirmed this
week by the Kremlin after his latest bout of ``nervous
exhaustion.'' Now, according to his chief spokesman, Dmitri
Yakushkin, he will have the time ``to plan other things,'' in
particular his handover of power in 2000, when his term ends.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing Yeltsin to a long-distance runner on his last lap,
Yakushkin said the constitutional review was only indirectly
related to his health. ``The only connection is that Yeltsin does
not get any younger with each year, and a minor cold, given his
health, has much more serious consequences,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A team of doctors ruled Thursday that Yeltsin, who has spent the
last two days at a medical center outside Moscow, is fit to fly on
Friday to Sochi, a Russian resort where he will spend a two-week
vacation, the Kremlin announced Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   According to Yakushkin, the legal panel, made up of about 10
lawyers to be named next month, will sort through proposed
constitutional amendments that have been floated publicly as
opposition leaders press to reduce Yeltsin's political powers, and
even oust him.
</P>
<P>
   According to a poll made public on Thursday by the Public
Opinion foundation, a polling group, 75 percent of 1,500 Russians
questioned said they would favor Yeltsin's impeachment, a process
that has already begun in Parliament, even though its chances of
being completed are very slight.
</P>
<P>
   Yakushkin said Yeltsin _ whose final approval is needed for
constitutional amendments _ would not consider any changes that
would diminish the considerable powers of the presidency, or cede
its authority to a parliamentary majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing will be approved that makes the system of power more
fragile,'' Yakushkin said in an interview, ``only that which will
strengthen it.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said the issue of a vice presidency _ a post stricken
from the 1993 Constitution after Yeltsin's last vice president
tried to lead a mutiny against him _ will be on the agenda,
answering a surge of questions that have been raised about the
current line of succession.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed council will review this and other proposals, and
submit its own recommendations, Yakushkin said. The timing, he
said, will depend on ``the intensity of the public discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the current Constitution, in the event of the death or
disability of a president, the job passes to the prime minister,
who then must hold special elections within three months. A vice
president _ if a provision to create the job were inserted into the
Constitution _ would succeed a president until the end of the
regular four-year term.
</P>
<P>
   Changing the Constitution is an arduous business, involving the
approval of three-fourths of Parliament's upper house, and
two-thirds of its lower house. A constitutional assembly can also
be called. A top Kremlin aide, Oleg Sysuyev, told a Russian
newspaper this week that Yeltsin would favor such a gathering, but
not if it is made up of current members of Parliament's
Communist-dominated lower house, as his opposition has proposed.
</P>
<P>
   Given the intensity of Russia's political debate and the urgency
of its economic crisis, some analysts say they doubt that there
will be time for such a leisurely procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they suggest that a proposal for constitutional
revision will amount, in fact, to an opening for political
negotiations over Yeltsin's succession _ either before his terms
ends or after. Few political analysts expect that the president
will retire early, except for reasons of health.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The issue is not the law _ it rarely is in Russia,'' said Otto
Latsis, a political analyst for the newspaper New Izvestia. ``It is
about specific people.''
</P>
<P>
   As Yeltsin's health has wavered from bad to worse in recent
weeks, the political jockeying to succeed him has stepped up, with
top contenders, like Mayor Yuri Luzhkov of Moscow, joining the
chorus calling on him to resign.
</P>
<P>
   But except perhaps for Luzhkov, early presidential elections, in
Russia's current condition, are seen as a risk by many political
leaders who have instead chosen to consolidate their support for
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov as Russia's surrogate president.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov, who took Yeltsin's place this week at a European Union
summit meeting in Austria after doctors ordered the president to
stay home, has already assumed many presidential functions, and is
expected to continue to substitute for Yeltsin abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews this week, Sysuyev said the president would no
longer be as involved as he once was in the daily operation of
government. The president, Sysuyev told a television interviewer on
Monday, will no longer demand to know ``about every ruble of wage
arrears.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Yeltsin's main function will be to serve as the
guarantor of Russia's integrity, and of the freedoms of its
citizens. ``Maybe this two-week vacation will help the president to
think about the newly formed situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yakushkin said Thursday that the president can now distance
himself from government, because for the first time in his seven
years in office, he has a prime minister who enjoys the support of
a majority in Parliament's cantankerous lower house.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this situation, and given the experience of the years
behind him, there will not be any intrusion, not only in technical
details but in day-to-day economic decision,'' Yakushkin said. ``He
won't intrude in any way, which was not the case before.
</P>
<P>
   According to his spokesman, the public pressure on Yeltsin has
taken its toll. ``He is very tired, and it can be felt,'' Yakushkin
said. ``There is some emotional stress, coming from all directions,
what he reads in the press, the attacks against him.''

 &HT;    AT THE MICROSOFT TRIAL THE LONG WAIT FOR GATES GOES ON
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Microsoft antitrust trial ended its second week
Thursday without returning to the much-anticipated videotaped
testimony of Bill Gates, fueling accusations that the software
giant was trying to delay what they expect will be a harmful
appearance from its chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft defense team continued its meticulous
cross-examination of witnesses called by the Justice Department,
which has missed at least four self-imposed deadlines to present
substantial portions of Gates's pretrial deposition. Only two of
the 24 to 28 listed witnesses in the case have testified so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are they filibustering?'' a reporter asked David Boies, the
government's chief trial lawyer, as he strode toward the courtroom
for the start of afternoon session.
</P>
<P>
   ``What other reason would there be for it?'' Boies replied.
</P>
<P>
   But Boies was more circumspect when the same query was posed
before the microphones on the courthouse steps. Pointing at white
marble Senate chamber, where legislation is sometimes talked to
death, he said he would not answer the question ``this close to
Capitol Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   During Thursday's lunch break, Boies said the Gates tape would
run that afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   And, indeed, it took Boies only 35 minutes to question David
Colburn, a vice president of America Online Inc. who had negotiated
the company's Internet browser deal with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   In its cross-examination, Microsoft sought to show that in a
1996 business proposal, AOL and Netscape Communications Corp.,
maker of a leading Internet browser, planned illegal collusion to
avoid competing with each other.
</P>
<P>
   But the fastidious questioning of Colburn by Microsoft lawyer
John Warden pushed the clock to within an hour of quitting time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have a happy Halloween,'' U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson said, dismissing the lawyers until next week. The
government has already scheduled another witness, Apple Computer
executive Avie Tevanian, when the trial resumes on Monday, and
court is recessed Tuesday for Election Day, thus further setting
back the timetable for Gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there have been any delaying tactics by
Microsoft,'' said Rick Rule, a former assistant attorney general
for antitrust who is serving as a consultant to Microsoft in the
case. ``Every one of John (Warden's) questions have been on
point,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers did show some of Gates's testimony on the
trial's opening day, sparking speculation that his testimony would
not serve Microsoft's cause well. The lawyers say Gates is highly
combative before the camera, while repeatedly being unable to
recall key events in the landmark case. Boies noted that ordinarily
a chief executive officer testifies in defense of his company in
major antitrust cases.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly seven hours of the 20-hour Gates deposition is due to be
aired to court as time and witness schedules permit. The first
segment is a mixture of two hours chosen by the government and an
hour chosen by Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The defense sought in vain to have Gates' testimony, taken in a
three-day deposition last August, counted against the government's
allotment.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and 20 states have charged Microsoft with
violating the nation's antitrust laws by competing unfairly against
Netscape, among others, in the market for Internet browsers.

MURRAY LEAD NARROWS IN WASHINGTON SENATE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Washington Sen. Patty Murray's lead over GOP
challenger Rep. Linda Smith has narrowed to 8 percentage points,
according to a new statewide poll.
</P>
<P>
   Murray's lead dropped from 13 percentage points in a similar
poll three weeks ago. It reflects Smith picking up strength in
rural areas, while Murray maintains a strong lead in the
Seattle-Tacoma area.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time Smith has narrowed the gap, she has seen a
sharp increase in the percentage of voters that hold negative
feelings about her. More people react negatively to her than the
incumbent Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smith will do well in rural parts of the state, and in Eastern
Washington, but Murray's lead among women and among Seattle-Tacoma
voters is overwhelming,'' said Del Ali, senior vice president of
Mason-Dixon Political/Media Research, which conducted the poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would need an all-time low turnout among Democratic voters
for Smith to have a chance,'' Ali said.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 801 voters by Mason-Dixon showed Murray at 49
percent of the vote, with Smith at 41 percent and 10 percent
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   The poll of likely voters was taken on Monday and Tuesday. The
margin of error is plus or minus 3.5 percent. The survey was taken
for the Post-Intelligencer and Seattle TV station KOMO 4 News.
</P>
<P>
   In Mason-Dixon's last poll, Murray held a 51-38 advantage.
Smith's gains were mainly in Republican-leaning areas east of the
Cascades.
</P>
<P>
   The poll found that 46 percent of voters have a favorable view
of Murray and 30 percent view her negatively, a figure that hasn't
changed in the past three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's favorable rating has climbed from 38 to 41 percent. But
as more people have come to know the Republican challenger, those
holding a negative view of Smith have climbed from 28 to 36
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is more of a polarizing figure,'' Tim Hibbitts, an
independent Portland-based pollster, said of Smith, a two-term
congresswoman from southwest Washington who is outspokenly
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   The survey's latest figures are close to those in Murray's own
tracking polls, said Rex Carney, spokesman for the senator.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Murray and Gov. Gary Locke will spend Sunday on a
bus tour of northwest Washington, where the race is close. They
will ride buses from Vancouver, Wash., to Seattle on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore will join the tour for rallies in
Olympia, Tacoma, Federal Way and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our primary goal now is to turn out Democratic voters, to
remind them what is at stake in this election,'' Carney said.
</P>
<P>
   While her campaign staff had nothing to say Wednesday about the
new poll showing the race narrowing, Smith has been voicing
absolute confidence on the campaign trail that she will win.
</P>
<P>
   She has predicted that Washington ``will go down in history''
and shock Washington, D.C., by electing a senator who has refused
political action committee donations.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Bader, a leading Republican consultant, said the latest
poll signals ``a real weakness'' and lack of enthusiasm for Murray
that her support is under 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately this race is fought in the suburbs among moderate
independent voters,'' Bader said.
</P>
<P>
   A wide difference of opinion between the sexes is apparent in
Washington's Senate race, only the third such contest in American
history to have women as both major party nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Murray enjoys a lead of 54 percent to 36 percent among women
voters. Smith runs narrowly ahead, 46 percent to 44 percent, among
men. The survey included 401 women and 400 men.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest of the election seems to be shaking out the way
Republican and Democratic races usually do statewide, but I am
surprised by the magnitude of the gender gap. I have not seen it
this pronounced before,'' said Rollin Fatland, a moderate
Republican strategist.
</P>
<P>
   Voters interviewed in the poll seemed to home in on differing
positions the candidates take on several issues.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is a longtime foe of abortion, opposing the termination of
pregnancies in cases of rape or incest. Murray argues that the
decision should be left ``to the woman, her doctor and her faith,''
even in the case of a late-term abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Stewart of Kirkland, a retired Boeing secretary, is
backing Murray. ``Linda Smith is against abortion and I feel that's
a woman's right and between her and her doctor,'' she said. ``I
think Linda Smith is too far right for my comfort.''
</P>
<P>
   Paula Lydon, a Chehalis housewife, cites Murray's support for
abortion rights as part of the reason she is inclined to vote for
Smith. ``Murray is a bit too liberal,'' Lydon said. ``I agree with
Smith on partial-birth abortion and infanticide.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollster Ali said Smith's race to catch Murray could be
daunting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smith has to do something she has failed to do _ she's got to
really raise Murray's unfavorables,'' he said. ``And if you haven't
done it a week before the election, unless there's a bomb you are
going to throw, you aren't going to move people.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of thing could turn the tide? Two what-ifs, which
I'm not seeing right now _ an anti-Clinton tide and a strong GOP
surge.''
</P>
<P>
   Hibbitts, in Portland, noted the fervor of followers that Smith
calls ``Linda's Army,'' adding: ``The one thing that gives Smith
hope is a very poor turnout next Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cathy Allen, a Democratic consultant in Seattle, predicted
that working women _ the Democrats' strongest constituency _ will
be drawn to the polls by hotly contested initiatives to ban
affirmative action and late-term abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The closeness of the election makes the issue of voter turnout
critical.
</P>
<P>
   The Mason-Dixon poll asked people across the state whether, if
the election were held today, they would vote for the Democratic or
the Republican candidate for the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a near dead-heat, with 45 percent saying the
Democrat, 44 percent the Republican, and 11 percent not sure.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats held a 50 percent to 38 percent lead in the
Seattle-Tacoma area. Republicans were running well ahead in Central
and Eastern Washington. But the two sides were neck-and-neck in
southwest and northwest Washington, scene of hotly contested House
races.
</P>
<P>
   Once more, the gender gap was a chasm. By 53 to 39 percent, with
8 percent undecided, male voters said they would support a
Republican. Women lined up behind the Democrats 51-35 percent, with
14 percent unsure.

IN HONG KONG, GURKHA BODYGUARDS ARE STATUS SYMBOL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ When tycoons step out of their Rolls-Royces here
these days, they are often quickly surrounded by a phalanx of
compact but fierce-looking bodyguards. These are Gurkhas, and while
they come from the uplands of Nepal, they are deeply embedded in
Hong Kong's history.
</P>
<P>
   For half a century, Gurkha soldiers served in the British army
here, gaining fame for their skill as fighters. But when Britain
handed Hong Kong over to China last year, the Gurkhas suddenly
found themselves relieved of duty _ colonial relics as
superannuated as the governor's ostrich-plumed hat.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after two spectacular kidnappings of local tycoons, the
Gurkhas have reinvented themselves as the protectors of choice for
Hong Kong's frightened rich. Fearing a wave of copycat abductions,
business people are hiring Gurkhas by the dozens to protect
themselves and their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a situation where highly trained men with military
backgrounds are taking children to and from school every day,''
said Stephen Vickers, a former commander of the Criminal
Intelligence Bureau of the Hong Kong Police. He has handled 28
kidnappings in nearly two decades on the force.
</P>
<P>
   Like so much else in Hong Kong, personal security has turned
into a status-driven business, with a well-defined hierarchy of
products and services. In the world of surveillance cameras,
bulletproof limousines, and big guys with padded jackets, having
your own Gurkha is the ultimate status symbol.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of the Hong Kong thing about showing off your
wealth,'' said Nigel Collett, a retired British army officer who
commanded a Gurkha garrison in Brunei and now runs a company that
places Gurkhas as bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   Collett is quick to add that the demand for Gurkhas has grown in
the last two years for serious reasons: With a more porous border
between Hong Kong and the rest of China, gangsters who operate on
both sides of the fence have become increasingly brazen in their
targeting of wealthy people here.
</P>
<P>
   The vulnerability of the tycoons has been dramatized by the case
of Cheung Tze-keung, 44, a Hong Kong man who is being tried in the
nearby Chinese city of Guangzhou for allegedly abducting members of
two powerful Hong Kong families and extorting more than $200
million in ransom.
</P>
<P>
   Cheung goes by the nickname Big Spender, and his testimony at
the trial over the last two weeks has only burnished his
extravagant reputation. After kidnapping Victor Li, the eldest son
of the tycoon Li Ka-shing, Cheung said he negotiated a $133 million
ransom with the father _ camping out at the Li family home as the
elder Li cobbled together the cash.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of his other kidnapping victim, the billionaire
property developer Walter Kwok, the negotiation took longer because
Kwok's brothers haggled over the terms of the ransom, getting it
down to $77 million.
</P>
<P>
   Cheung and 35 members of his gang were eventually arrested by
the police in Guangdong province. Because the families did not
report the crimes to the Hong Kong Police, the Chinese asserted
jurisdiction over the case. Testimony in trial ended Thursday, and
a verdict could come within a week. Cheung faces the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Although Li and Kwok were released unharmed, the kidnappings
have spooked other wealthy Hong Kong business people. Neither man
was traveling with a bodyguard at the time he was kidnapped, and
Cheung boasted that he was able to track their movements with
uncanny precision.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could put ideas in bad people's minds,'' said Paul Yung,
a former bodyguard for Hong Kong's last colonial governor,
Christopher Patten. Yung now handles security for a prominent local
financier, Dickson Poon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so easy,'' he added. ``There is so much money to be
made. It's worth taking a risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Security experts said wealthy Hong Kongers practice bad habits
that make them easy prey _ frequenting the same clubs, restaurants
and race tracks. ``Hong Kong is really a goldfish bowl,'' Vickers
said. ``Everybody knows everybody else's business, and they all go
to the same places.''
</P>
<P>
   This is where the Gurkhas come in. Known for their loyalty and
discretion, they are unlikely to gossip about habits or whereabouts
of their employers. Although many Gurkhas speak English, almost
none speak Cantonese. And Yung said they were less susceptible to
bribery than Chinese bodyguards.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Indeed, the Nepalese guards who protect Poon declined to discuss
their lives or work, even in the most general terms.
</P>
<P>
   Gurkhas are not a perfect deterrent to the security threat. Yung
noted that their background and military training were better
suited to jungle warfare than urban terrorism. Gurkhas trace their
roots as British soldiers to the British-Nepalese war of 1812, when
they impressed Britain by holding off a British invasion. The
Gurkhas later served alongside British troops in India and
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   Gurkhas also do not come cheap. A seasoned bodyguard with
military training earns nearly $40,000 a year. This may not seem
like much, except that fretful tycoons typically hire three guards
for each member of the family. For a family of four, that adds up
to $480,000 _ not counting the armor-plated BMW.
</P>
<P>
   Not every rich Hong Kong family employs Gurkhas. While Victor Li
and his father now use them, the Kwok family has hired Chinese
bodyguards, who are supervised by a retired Hong Kong police
commander.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for many of Hong Kong's elite, Gurkhas are the gold
standard. Poon, a flamboyant merchant best known in the United
States for trying to buy Barney's department store, employs a
contingent of a dozen Gurkhas _ a security detail that befits a
head of state more than a retailer.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent society wedding here, Collett recalled, so many
tycoons arrived with their distinctive sturdy guards that a local
newspaper joked that the Gurkhas outnumbered the guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were all showing off their Gurkhas,'' he said, shaking
his head. ``A Hong Kong person could probably do the job just as
well.''

JOB GROWTH PACE SEEN SLOWING IN MASSACHUSETTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Retransmitting for Mass. clients)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Economists predict that the pace of job growth in
Massachusetts would slow dramatically next year, as the economy is
taxed by a contraction in manufacturing that spreads to other
sectors.
</P>
<P>
   Recession is not forecast for the state, which during the 1990s
has enjoyed its longest economic expansion ever, regional
economists concluded at their semiannual gathering yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard DeKaser, the director of the New England Economic
Project, believes job growth would slow next year by more than
half, to less than 1 percent annually by the end of 1999. That's
compared with current annual job growth of more than 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The slowing experience in Massachusetts since the beginning of
the year has been markedly sharper than that experienced
nationally,'' DeKaser said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the global economy has been in turmoil for more than a
year, its potential impact domestically has confounded economists
who see few signs of recession yet, but who fear the worst.
</P>
<P>
   The report on the state of New England's economy cites tangible
signs that events overseas are beginning to hit home:
</P>
<P>
   _Consumer confidence, though still high in Massachusetts, has
dropped sharply since January.
</P>
<P>
   _Initial applications for unemployment insurance have risen at a
faster pace in Massachusetts in recent weeks than they have
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   _Help wanted advertising in Massachusetts is down, while US
classified advertising has held at peak levels.
</P>
<P>
   _Every state in New England is expected to experience a slowdown
in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of Massachusetts' malaise is a contraction in
manufacturing, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   After a torrid pace of export growth through the end of 1997,
economists said manufacturers built extra inventory. That produced
an ``overhang'' when demand for their products declined due to the
recession in Asia and strengthening in the US dollar, which made US
products more expensive for consumers in emerging economies.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, manufacturers reliant on overseas markets to sell
their products, whether razor blades made by Gillette Co., or
semiconductor equipment made by Teradyne Inc., have shrunk
operations or announced layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Economic weakness ``is highly concentrated'' in manufacturing,
said DeKaser, though he has not seen any ``significant'' signs yet
that the slowdown has spread to the broader economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next six to nine months are going to be critical'' in
determining how the economy will fare, said Alan Clayton-Matthews,
an assistant professor of public policy at the University of
Massachusetts at Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, consumer confidence withstood shocks from a volatile
stock market and some layoffs or hiring freezes in key industries,
such as semiconductors and financial services. Mass Insight, a
Cambridge organization which publishes a consumer confidence index
for Massachusetts, said the index is down sharply from its January
peak of 130. It was 116 in October, down from 122 in July.
</P>
<P>
   A drop in the index shows consumers are receiving signals from
the economy that ``are causing them to worry about the future,''
Mass Insight said in its quarterly report. If the stock market
drops or corporate profits decline, a retrenchment by consumers
would be the single biggest dampener on economic growth, economists
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knows how deep the worldwide crisis will be nor how
long it will last,'' Clayton-Matthews said. ``That uncertainty can
make business planners delay projects and make consumers delay
spending.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the New England Economic Project report said service
industries, the state's biggest engine of economic growth, have not
shown signs of slowing, Mark Zandi, chief economist for Regional
Financial Associates in Westchester, Pa., said financial services
are ``vital'' to Massachusetts' &UR;  &LR; economic future.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market, which is down from its July peak but up for
the full year, has buoyed consumer confidence. The financial
industry is also an important employer. Money management firms, for
example, employ just 1 percent of the state's workers, but those
workers' high earnings make up 3 percent of total incomes
statewide, according to one estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Zandi forecast that US economic growth would be ``much slower''
in 1999, due to lower corporate profits, a decline in stock prices
and a tightening of credit. ``We haven't seen those effects yet,''
he said. But, ``these are driving forces at work.'' Growth slowed
in 1998 to 1.5 percent, compared with 3.5 percent in 1997, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts economy earlier this year might have avoided a
sharp slowdown when world economic turmoil was limited to Asia,
Zandi said. Massachusetts is less dependent on exports than the
country as a whole. Merchandise exports are less than 1 precent of
gross domestic product in Massachusetts, compared with 2.5 percent
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   However, the state has become more vulnerable as troubles have
spread beyond Asia, to other important trading partners such as
Canada, Mexico and Latin America. ``That becomes a problem for
Boston's and Massachusetts' economy,'' Zandi said.

IMPEACHMENT STAND COULD HURT REPUBLICANS: POLL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The possible impeachment of President Clinton is an
issue that could backfire against Republicans in Tuesday's
election, according to a new statewide poll.
</P>
<P>
   In the survey of 801 likely voters, 52 percent of those polled _
and 64 percent of women _ gave Clinton ``excellent'' or ``good''
marks on his performance as president. Another 20 percent rated
Clinton's performance as fair, and 28 percent as poor.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's approval rating is down slightly from a survey three
weeks ago, and the president's standing is much lower among men
than women.
</P>
<P>
   But the poll also showed, among both sexes, that a
pro-impeachment stand is more likely to hurt than help a Senate or
House candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, by Mason-Dixon Political/Media Research, asked whether
citizens were more likely or less likely to vote for a candidate
who supports Clinton's impeachment, or if the issue would have no
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-six percent said it would make no difference, but 34
percent said they would be more inclined to vote against a
candidate backing impeachment, and 18 percent said they were more
likely to vote for someone advocating Clinton's removal.
</P>
<P>
   The poll of likely voters was taken on Monday and Tuesday. The
margin of error is plus or minus 3.5 percent. The survey was taken
for the Post-Intelligencer and KOMO 4 News.
</P>
<P>
   Del Ali, senior vice president of Mason-Dixon, termed it ``an
amazing result'' that so many of those surveyed said they would be
less likely to vote for a candidate who would vote for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The findings comes as Republicans gear up a $10 million
nationwide TV campaign designed to remind voters of Clinton's
problems and the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (campaign) may be the all-time dumbest thing I've ever
seen,'' Ali said. ``It tells me someone at the Republican National
Committee isn't looking at state by state polling numbers. ... Such
a strategy could work in Idaho and Utah, but for the most part I
can't understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   The GOP's Senate candidate, Rep. Linda Smith, has said she would
vote to impeach if the House of Representatives makes a decision on
the issue before the 105th Congress adjourns.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Constitution, a House majority can pass a bill of
impeachment against the president. The charges then go to the
Senate for a formal trial. A two-thirds vote is required to remove
the president.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews Wednesday, a number of people polled by
Mason-Dixon indicated that Clinton's conduct, and the prolonged
investigation of the president, is having an influence on how they
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton is doing just fine, and the economy is in a good
position compared to what it has been. The man's private life is
separate from his professional life,'' said Stacey Jasmer, a clerk
from Airway Heights near Spokane.
</P>
<P>
   Louise Winter of Maple Valley, who works for a health insurer,
said, however, that Clinton's problems have made her ``more firm''
in the decision to ``vote conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the best thing for this country is for President
Clinton to be removed from office so this country can move
forward,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Bader, a top Republican strategist working for GOP Rep.
Rick White, seemed skeptical about the GOP's new anti-Clinton
advertising campaign and described it as ``a bit of a gamble.''
White has seen his Democratic challenger, Jay Inslee, invigorate
his campaign with a TV ad that called for an end to the impeachment
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The ad campaign also was questioned by Tim Hibbitts, an
independent Portland-based pollster who is tracking an Oregon House
race that is as close as Washington's White-Inslee contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty clear the Republicans have gotten their fingers
burned by nosing around (impeachment) and finding themselves on the
wrong side of public opinion,'' he said.

`VAMPIRES' DELIVERS THE BLOOD, GORE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 3 Stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For his latest release, ``Vampires,'' veteran
fantasy-film director John Carpenter set out to cross a horror
movie with ``The Wild Bunch.'' He's succeeded in a goofy, purposely
offensive kind of way. It's hardly a great film _ and certainly no
classic of either the fright or the western genres _ but taken in
the properly twisted spirit, it's smart and nasty Halloween fun.
</P>
<P>
   Filmed in none-too-fussy wide-screen against beautiful New
Mexico landscapes, the picture charts the declining fortunes of a
medium-tech, low-brow band of modern vampire hunters. Led by the
obsessive, brutal and totally out-of-control Jack Crow (James Woods
at his most entertainingly irritating) and the stolid, marginally
more sensitive Tony Montoya (Daniel Baldwin), they bust up
rancheros full of bloodsuckers with state-of-the-art crossbows and
power winches that haul the goons out into disintegrating sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   While celebrating a recent nest-cleaning at a motel
beer-and-hookers blast, however, most of the team is eviscerated by
a supervampire named Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith). With only the aid
of an untrained Vatican envoy, Father Adam (Tim Guinee), and a
bitten prostitute, Katrina (Sheryl Lee), who hasn't quite turned
into one of Valek's minions yet, Crow and Montoya must take on a
small army of the undead before it becomes too powerful to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Emphasizing grotesque effects, sadistic action, misogyny and
Woods' incomparably foul mouth, Carpenter has a high old time
hurling tough-guy movie cliches at the wall and seeing which ones
make the biggest splat. He also gets the ultimate kinky romance
going between Montoya and Katrina amid all the carnage and mad
machismo, as well as an interesting, blood-brotherly dynamic
percolating among the three main guys.
</P>
<P>
   Those little niceties aside, though, ``Vampires'' just wants to
get down and dirty and turn the screen into one big graveyard
smash. It could've had higher aspirations, of course, but it
probably wouldn't have achieved them as well.

`VAMPIRES' BRINGS OUT THE WORST QUALITIES IN HUMAN NATURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the first major excursion into the endlessly popular vampire
genre by the well-regarded director of such horror classics as
``Halloween,'' ``The Fog'' and ``They Live,'' John Carpenter's
``Vampires'' promised to be something special.
</P>
<P>
   But, surprisingly, it's barely a horror movie at all. And it has
none of the conventions of the vampire genre: the prickly suspense,
the smoldering undertone of kinky sexuality, the flashing fangs and
delicious midnight mood.
</P>
<P>
   Like last August's vampire epic, ``Blade'' (which has roughly
the same plot), this one is essentially a combat movie, a
destruct-athon that has more to do with the empty-headed propaganda
movies of World War II than the traditions of the ``Dracula''
cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Its hero is Jack Crow (James Woods), a tough, no-nonsense
vampire slayer who was orphaned by the creatures years ago and is
now employed by the Vatican to ``clean out'' nests of them, mostly
in the remote spaces of the American Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Jack's chief nemesis is Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith), a
``master'' or super-vampire who, 600 years ago, started the
phenomenon of vampirism and is now looking for a certain black
cross that, if possessed, will allow him to walk around in the
daylight.
</P>
<P>
   In the process of stopping him, Jack has to kill as many of
Valek's followers as he can. So the movie is a series of
search-and-destroy missions: finding the creatures, gunning them to
the ground, impaling them, cutting off their heads, dragging them
into the sunlight, etc.
</P>
<P>
   What the movie communicates is the joy of killing. It delights,
for instance, in having Jack dismember the hand of a vampire with
five shots of his .45, or showing his lieutenant (Daniel Baldwin)
slug and impale a female vampire (``take that, bitch!''), or
mesmerizing us with the sheer visual spectacle of vampires
exploding into flame.
</P>
<P>
   In one scene, Jack and his crew take the skulls of nine vampires
they have just killed and attach them to the hood of their jeep, as
ornaments _ just like some of our boys did in Vietnam and Korea.
Jack even calls the creatures ``Goons,'' which often comes out
sounding like ``Gooks.''
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, we're talking about vampires here. They're not human.
They only look human. They're an ethnic group that must be
exterminated.
</P>
<P>
   So the genocide is politically correct. It's even OK to enjoy it
as much as Jack does, to revel in the swaggering macho brutality
with which the justifiable homicide is carried out.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in Carpenter's vision, the extermination of this
despised demographic group is not only great fun, it's irresistibly
sexy. At one key point in the bloodbath, Jack taunts his Catholic
priest companion: ``Did that (killing) give you a woody
(erection)?'' he asks with a knowing grin. Of course, it did.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem with this vision is the ease with which it can
be extended to other ethnic groups. After all, the way Jack feels
about vampires is exactly the way Hitler felt about the Jews. The
way Hindus in the Punjab feel about Muslims. The Hutus about Tutsis
in Rwanda. The Tamils about the Sinhalese in Sri Lanka. The Serbs
about the Albanians in Kosovo. Wyoming rednecks about gays.
</P>
<P>
   So it's not much of a stretch to see the vampires as a metaphor
for anyone we might consider ``them,'' not ``us,'' and to see the
movie as a celebration of the joys of ethnic cleansing. And since
Carpenter is such a competent filmmaker, his movie is incredibly
effective: It turns us into happy war criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's possible I am misreading the movie and
Carpenter's intentions. Perhaps ``Jack Crow'' is a sly allusion to
``Jim Crow,'' and maybe Carpenter is actually trying to give a
subtle demonstration of how _ given a proper enemy _ there's a Nazi
in each of us just waiting to get out.
</P>
<P>
   But if that's his intention, ``Vampires'' fails even more
miserably. There's no hint of a tongue-in-cheek or a subtle
between-the-lines message. The only possible conclusion is that,
more than any major Hollywood film of the '90s, this one is trying
to appeal to the absolute worst in its audience.
</P>

WOODS, BALDWIN ADMIT `VAMPIRES' IS STRANGE VEIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES &UR;  &LR; _ In ``John Carpenter's Vampires,'' James Woods and
Daniel Baldwin head a team of Vatican-sanctioned vampire hunters
who tear up the New Mexico countryside in their pursuit of (and
flights from) the undead.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bloody, profane, self-joshing horror/action/comedy from
the man responsible for such genre classics as the original
``Halloween,'' ``The Fog,'' ``Escape From New York'' and
``Starman.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it's not the kind of project you associate with either Woods
_ the 51-year-old, multi-Emmy-winning and Oscar-nominated actor
known for his intense and unsettling performances in ``Salvador,''
``Citizen Cohn,'' ``Ghosts of Mississippi,'' among many others _ or
the 37-year-old Baldwin, the serious character actor from the
famous movie-star clan and ex-cast member of TV's acclaimed
``Homicide: Life on the Street'' series.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe that's why Woods' belligerent, brutal Jack Crow and
Baldwin's secretive, conflicted Tony Montoya make such an
interesting pair of stake-wielding stalkers; they're played by real
actors, guys who can't help trying to make them, and their
relationship, at least as interesting as the bloodbaths they wade
through.
</P>
<P>
   Woods and Baldwin discussed the joys and fears of this
particular, every-day-was-Halloween job with the Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   DAILY NEWS: You're both well-respected actors. Why do a gory
vampire movie at this point in your careers? &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; JAMES WOODS: It's absolutely a flick, and that's why I wanted
to do it. I have five serious movies coming up: ``The General's
Daughter'' with John Travolta; Clint Eastwood's ``True Crime'';
``Another Day in Paradise,'' which is about heroin addicts; ``The
Virgin Suicides,'' based on a book-award winner; and I'm about to
do Oliver Stone's next movie.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not against the law, just because I have a shelf full
of gold at home, to take a vampire movie and try to do something
interesting with it. I did David Cronenberg's ``Videodrome'' at a
time when he made movies about people's heads blowing up, and it's
now become, unequivocally, a science-fiction classic.
</P>
<P>
   I've wanted to do a horror movie all my life, and I've always
wanted to do a western. Well, I'm really too kind of urban, in my
mentality, to do a western. But this really is a western; I get to
play Bill Holden or John Wayne, but in a way that's entertaining.
And I get to do it with John Carpenter, who is, horror-meister and
all that, in the purest cinematic sense an auteur.
</P>
<P>
   DANIEL BALDWIN: When the script came to my house, I saw the
title ``Vampires,'' said ``Are you kidding me?'' and threw it
aside. I'd never seen a vampire film that I liked _ never _ and I
didn't think there would be challenges for me from an acting
standpoint.
</P>
<P>
   But when I finally did read it, it turned out to be a pretty
cool story. Now, keep in mind, I don't think this is going to be
nominated for Best Screenplay. But at the same time, how many times
have you seen a vampire movie where there was any story? Certainly,
my character, Montoya, has a most interesting arc of development.
All in all, I was very surprised by the amount of acting I got to
do and the stuff I was able to bring to the table for this film.
</P>
<P>
   DN: Was there a standout acting challenge for either of you
guys?
</P>
<P>
   WOODS: There was a scene where a whole motel was supposed to
blow up, and I asked John, ``Do we have the money for this? I mean,
that's a big CGI effect, gonna take a lot of computer work.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``No, it's not. We're going to put 100 barrels of
gasoline in the motel with explosive charges in them. You're going
to walk out and when you're about 30 feet out, we're going to blow
up the motel.''
</P>
<P>
   I said, ``Uh-huh. Let me just get this straight: What am I
supposed to do?''
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``Well, one, try not to die. And if you live, be a man
and don't flinch, OK?''
</P>
<P>
   What's great when you watch it is, I don't flinch, I'm proud to
say. However, you'll notice that my hair blows forward. it was
weird, it was fun. but i was really glad when it was over.
</P>
<P>
   BALDWIN: Well, Montoya's the love interest in this movie, with
Sheryl Lee's character. But in a very bizarre way! It's not
consummated, shall we say, in the traditional manner.
</P>
<P>
   DN: Horrific as it is, you all seem to be having a pretty good
time in ``Vampires.'' Was making it as much fun as it looks?
</P>
<P>
   WOODS: Well, the strip clubs in Santa Fe were fabulous. I
couldn't get Dan and John out of them! I'd say, ``Guys, there's a
nice Georgia O'Keeffe exhibit down the road. Please, be like me and
watch PBS.''
</P>
<P>
   No, we had a really good time. The work was hardly acting. Most
of the stuff that people ask me about in the movie was completely
ad-libbed. We were just fooling around and John kept the camera
running.
</P>
<P>
   DN: Daniel, is Woods as much of a wild man as he wants us all to
think he is?
</P>
<P>
   BALDWIN: I didn't always know if he was approachable. I'd look
at some scenes we were doing and think, Ooh, don't go near Woods
today.
</P>
<P>
   James is one of these actors that needs controversy around him.
He would, you know, come out of his trailer and complain that his
oatmeal wasn't warm enough and he was going to be on a plane if the
air conditioning wasn't fixed by the time he got back from lunch.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know where that comes from. He's a pretty nice guy, and
I've spent a lot of time with him now. When we weren't working, we
played a lot of golf together _ where I consistently took his per
diem, which was a lot of fun.
</P>
<P>
   DN: Do you consider yourself hard to deal with, James? I know
you have a genius-level IQ, and a lot of times smart people are
thought of as difficult.
</P>
<P>
   WOODS: Well, my IQ was up there before I became an actor, but
the intellectual acid rain of living in Hollywood has eaten it
away.
</P>
<P>
   My attitude always is, I'll give a director every idea I've got.
I'll just try a bunch of great stuff, a bunch of weird stuff and,
maybe, a bunch of really bad stuff, and let them decide which is
which. If they don't like it, we won't do it. They could be wrong,
but I don't care, we're not going to waste time about it.
</P>
<P>
   DN: Daniel, you had a terrible cocaine overdose at the Plaza
Hotel last February. How are you now?
</P>
<P>
   BALDWIN: I'm OK, I have seven months of sobriety back.
</P>
<P>
   This is something that I did. Unfortunately, I have a disease
that I don't want anybody to feel sorry for me for. But I claim
responsibility for it.
</P>
<P>
   Let me put it in other terms. If it came out that I had cancer,
and family and friends and fans were worried about me, and I
decided to go golfing instead of getting chemo treatment one
weekend, and then the next weekend I decided to go skiing, and it
added up and the tumor almost killed me, you'd be like, ``Gee, I
really feel bad for the guy, but what an idiot!''
</P>
<P>
   I was in remission for my disease by attending AA meetings and
seeing my psychiatrist and doing the work necessary to maintain my
sobriety. I got complacent. I am to blame for what happened to me,
and I will never let that happen again.
</P>
<P>
   DN: You're looking mighty fit and healthy, James. What's your
secret?
</P>
<P>
   WOODS: I've just started smoking again after five years, and I'm
so happy! People ask, ``How do you feel? Did you get depressed?'' I
say, ``Get depressed? This is so much fun, why didn't I do this
five years ago?''

JORDI SAVALL: UPDATING THE MUSIC OF SPANISH MONARCHS

 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wednesday night's concert at Alice Tully Hall was
given by Jordi Savall and his big band: the players on viols,
guitar, percussion, assorted wind instruments and keyboards of his
group Hesperion XX together with the six singers of his La Capella
Reial de Catalunya. And they kicked up quite a storm.
</P>
<P>
   Nominally the program was devoted to Spanish music during the
time of Philip II, who died 400 years ago, but there were pieces
from well before this solemn monarch was born _ from the era when
his great-grandparents, Ferdinand and Isabella, were reconquering
Granada from the Moors _ and there were others that spilled over
well into the 17th century. Historical boundaries were not too
important. This was music being made now, music that took off from
incomplete sources and was projected with great vim and polish.
</P>
<P>
   Different blendings of voices and instruments were used with
cheerful exuberance. A piece by Bartomeu Carceres became a
Christmas rap song, with the singers taking turns at the verses,
separated by instrumental solos that suggested jazz was born in
16th-century Madrid. Probably flamenco started there too, for a
couple of numbers had strong syncopations endorsed by Pedro Estevan
on castanets.
</P>
<P>
   Often the players would partly improvise, as it seemed, a segue.
In the case of Francisco Correa de Arrauxo's hymn honoring the
Immaculate Conception, the instrumental meditation, led by Savall
on a small viol, was considerably longer than the original music,
and none the worse for that.
</P>
<P>
   Other crucial performers included the soprano Montserrat
Figueras, whose voice sounds like a sideways seductive smile, and
Carlos Mena, a confident countertenor. Performances mattered more
than repertory, but a few pieces stood out, notably a suavely
somber madrigal by Francisco Guerrero, the major composer who was
almost exactly Philip's contemporary, and a song by Juan del Enzina
from soon after the victory in Granada.
</P>
<P>
   This piece could teach us something in terms of its sympathy for
an ethnic-religious enemy. It is a lament placed in the mouth of
the last king of Granada and pays respect to the Moorish culture,
which surely contributed to its haunting melody. It is a small
musical equivalent of the tiled courtyards and dribbling fountains
of the Real Alcazar in Seville.

 &HT;    Talking with ... Barbara Kingsolver
 &HT;    By Carolyn Nizzi Warmbold
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barbara Kingsolver hearkened to past experiences in creating her
new novel, ``The Poisonwood Bible'' (HarperCollins, $26), which is
set partly in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The book focuses on the Price family, who set out from
Bethlehem, Ga., in 1959 to serve for a year as unsanctioned,
evangelical Baptist missionaries in a Congo village. The story is
told not by Nathan Price, who bullies his wife and four daughters,
but by the five female family members over several decades.
</P>
<P>
   As the daughter of public health workers _ ``different in every
way from the parents I created for the narrators of this tale'' _
Kingsolver spent time in the Congo as a child. In a recent phone
interview from her Tucson, Ariz., home, the author, born in 1955,
recalled her family's stay in a remote village in the early '60s
when former dictator Mobutu Sese Seko was coming to power (after
the novel's political events). ``It was my first experience with
another world,'' she said, ``and it permanently altered notions of
my own culture. ... It formed my idea of right
</P>
<P>
   and wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Kingsolver spent five years outlining and writing the novel.
``It was an enormous project and scary,'' she said. ``I was afraid
I wouldn't be able to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The author has always been interested in cultural differ-
</P>
<P>
   ences. ``It's easy to settle into a particular culture and to
feel right about your place at the table,'' she said. ``There's
nothing like a visit to an extremely different culture to unsettle
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kingsolver grew up in Kentucky but spent a lot of time in
Georgia, hiking and visiting Atlanta, so it made sense to use North
Georgia as the family's starting point. Besides, she wanted her
characters to come from the segregated South of the 1950s and to
``carry those ideas about race into Africa with very interesting
results.'' And finally, she wanted some of the Prices to return
home and to come of age as Atlanta and the nation did. The city's
rich civil rights history is important in the course of the novel,
as is its Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Talking with ... Nanci Kincaid
</P>
<P>
   By Don O'Briant
</P>
<P>
   c. 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   If anyone is qualified to write a novel about college football
and its impact on Southern women, it's Nanci Kincaid. A former
homecoming queen at Virginia Tech, Kincaid quit school at 19,
married the quarterback and devoted her life to being a college
football coach's wife.
</P>
<P>
   Now divorced and married to another coach, Dick Tomey of the
University of Arizona Wildcats, Kincaid has written a novel with a
title that would make a cheerleader blush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Balls'' (Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill, $21.95) is the story
of a Southern college football coach's fall from grace. Kincaid
used multiple female narrators because, she says, ``I love the way
women's language and lives blur together. One woman's story is not
necessarily every woman's story, but the way women talk their way
to the truth is pretty universal.''
</P>
<P>
   A central element in Kincaid's novel is the challenge to the
``Sleeping Beauty'' myth. ``In the fairy tale it is the kiss of the
prince that wakes the woman and brings her to life. But, of course,
in real life it is the kiss of the prince that puts the woman to
sleep. The byproduct of wifedom and motherhood can be a sort of
mild anesthesia that prevents you from feeling much pain because
you are too busy making sure those around you feel no pain. And,
particularly in the Southern culture, a woman's beauty can be
directly dependent upon her ability to stay asleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking with ... John Holman
</P>
<P>
   By Don O'Briant
</P>
<P>
   c. 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   For some writers, moving from short stories to novels is like
attempting a marathon after training for the 100-meter sprint. John
Holman, an associate professor at Georgia State University, knows
the feeling. After writing ``Squabble and Other Stories,'' an
acclaimed collection of short fiction in
</P>
<P>
   1990, Holman has just published his first novel, ``Luminous
Mysteries'' (Harcourt Brace, $22).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about developing a longer attention span,'' says
Holman, who grew up reading Vladimir Nabokov and studied with
author Frederick Barthelme while earning his doctorate at the
University of Southern Mississippi. ``Universities are geared to
teach the short story as a form, but publishers think the public
would rather read or
</P>
<P>
   buy novels.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Luminous Mysteries'' is the story of a group of Southerners
who are essentially orphans. The characters are Grim Power; his
older sister, Rita; her daughter Camaro (one of four children in
the family named after cars); and their friends Belly Man, Lonnie
and Butter. All struggle to make connections and hold onto their
dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are mostly African-Americans in the contemporary
South,'' says Holman, 47. ``I'm writing about the kind of people I
grew up with in Durham County, N.C. I'm not trying to make a
different kind of Southern literature.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking with ... Russ Rymer
</P>
<P>
   By Don O'Briant
</P>
<P>
   c. 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 20 years ago, Atlanta native Russ Rymer was researching
an article on the coastal islands for Brown's Guide to Georgia when
he saw a sign advertising a place that was not on his map.
Intrigued, he followed the road to American Beach, a
once-prosperous black community on the coast of northeast Florida
that was slowly dying.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like a lost civilization,'' says Rymer, 46, who
lives now in Los Angeles. ``I kept trying to interest Brown's Guide
and the Atlantic magazine in a story about the town, but there were
no takers.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, as a senior editor for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution's
Sunday magazine in the early 1980s, Rymer kept going back to do
interviews. ``It wasn't until about five years ago that I got a
book contract and moved to Florida to work on the story. Even at
that point, it was almost entirely closed up. It had a little
business district that had thrived until integration lured the
customer base away to other places.''
</P>
<P>
   In the process of doing research for ``American Beach: A Saga of
Race, Wealth and Memory'' (HarperCollins, $24, November), Rymer
came across two other subjects that tied in with the story. One was
the murder of Dennis Wilson, an unarmed black motorist killed by
white police in a Florida resort town. The other was the success of
Zora Neale Hurston's hometown of Eatonville, which thrives in the
shadow of Disney's planned community, Celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilson's murder was not just about racism and hatred, it was
how everyone's life is being changed by economics,'' Rymer says.
``The book is the story of how whole societies are created and then
destroyed, and the rift between morality and money. Eatonville is
an optimistic version of American Beach. It's succeeded in using
its history to save itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking with ... Ann Waldron
</P>
<P>
   By Carolyn Nizzi Warmbold
</P>
<P>
   c. 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   It is sheer hell,'' Ann Waldron says when asked what it's like
to write a biography of a resolutely reluctant subject. ``I will
never do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Waldron spent five years researching and writing ``Eudora: A
Writer's Life'' (Doubleday, $25.95), due out Nov. 10. Again and
again, Waldron would track down a Welty friend and request an
interview. Almost without fail, the friend would check with the
legendary writer and then call Waldron to report that Welty had
said, ``I'd rather you didn't talk to her.''
</P>
<P>
   In a phone interview from her Princeton, N.J., home, Waldron
says the book left her exhausted, but she's glad she persevered.
``I'm proud of myself,'' she says. ``I worked hard and didn't get
bitter and start picking at her.''
</P>
<P>
   Waldron, an Alabama native who was a reporter for The Atlanta
Constitution (1945-47) in addition to papers in Tampa, St.
Petersburg and Houston, wrote the life stories of two Southerners
in ``Hodding Carter: The Reconstruction of a Racist'' (1993) and
``Close Connections: Caroline Gordon and the Southern Renaissance''
(1987) and thought Welty was a natural next subject. ``I always
loved her work and think her writing is just the best,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   While she was still working on the Carter book, Waldron wrote to
Welty but never got a response. So she drove to Welty's house in
Jackson, Miss., and rang the doorbell. Welty ``complimented my
Caroline Gordon biography and said, `You caught her pulse,'''
Waldron says. But Welty went on to say she didn't want anybody to
write her biography.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Waldron occasionally repeated the visits and the request.
``I was a Southerner, and I still have my accent and I thought
people would melt when I went down South. They didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Waldron found much of her Welty material
</P>
<P>
   at the Mississippi archives and tracked down letter collections
at Duke University, the University of North Carolina and Boston
University. A few people connected to Welty's early life provided
information. But mostly there were refusals, which frustrated
Waldron, who says she was looking not for any ``terrible, guilty
secrets,'' but rather ordinary information.
</P>
<P>
   And after all, Waldron points out, Welty is ``a public figure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to expect to be written about.''
</P>
<P>
   First look: `The Kidnapping of Aaron Greene'
</P>
<P>
   On the morning that he would be kidnapped, Aaron Greene left his
umbrella at home.
</P>
<P>
   His mother had warned of rain. It was in the forecast, she had
said in her small, fretting voice. She had urged him to wear his
raincoat and take his umbrella, but he had forgotten the umbrella
in the rush of leaving, and now he thought of the five blocks he
would have to walk from the Omni Station to the Century National
Bank, and of the morning crowd that would push against him in its
hurried dash through the fine mist of the rain that had begun
during the train ride from Decatur. ... The morning crowd was there
each day at the Decatur train station, and at each stop on the ride
into the city _ at East Lake, Candler Park, Inman Park, King
Memorial _ it invaded the train, pressing into the aisles, hovering
over filled seats, their hands curled around ceiling handrails like
somnolent birds. In the city, the train emptied stop-by-stop and
the morning crowd flowed out onto the
</P>
<P>
   sidewalks and divided itself into thin streams at crossing
lights. ...
</P>
<P>
   In the rain, the morning crowd was always more violent.
</P>
<P>
   -- From ``The Kidnapping of Aaron Greene'' by Terry Kay (Morrow,
$25, December)
</P>
<P>
   First look: An excerpt from `Eudora: A Writer's Life'
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, January 25, 1996, a cold, wet day, I drove from New
Orleans to Jackson, Mississippi, dumped my luggage in the apartment
I had arranged to rent for a short term, and then went straight to
the Old Capitol building in downtown Jackson, next door to the
Mississippi Department of Archives and History, where Eudora
Welty's papers are kept.
</P>
<P>
   I had worked with her papers before and would work there again,
but on that day I wanted to go to the Old Capitol first.
</P>
<P>
   Eudora Welty was to receive the Legion d'Honneur from the
government of France, and I wanted to see it. ... I headed upstairs
to the gallery and found a seat in the second row. Below me, I
could see the reserved seats on the main floor of the House
chamber. We would be watching, I saw from the printed program, the
award ceremony at three o'clock, when the Honorable Gerard
Blanchot, consul general of France, would present the Legion
d'Honneur to Eudora Welty. It was only two twenty-five, and the
gallery was almost completely filled.
</P>
<P>
   The House chamber was well cared for and imposing, like all the
well-coifed, white-haired ladies it held. This was the room where
Andrew Jackson once spoke and where the members of the Mississippi
Legislature voted to secede from the Union in 1861. Tall windows
were hung with red draperies adorned with gold fringe. Two Ionic
columns, their scrolls covered with gold leaf, flanked the back
wall on each side of the Speaker's rostrum. Brass vases of magnolia
leaves _ the magnolia is Mississippi's state flower _ stood on the
rostrum. An American flag and a Mississippi flag hung on staffs.
</P>
<P>
   The floodlights set up for the television cameras were so bright
that people sitting near the rostrum had to shade their eyes.
Besides the white-haired ladies, there was a critical mass of
younger women, equally well turned out, and a few men.
</P>
<P>
   I recognized one of Eudora Welty's sisters-in-law, who came with
her nurse and sat near the front. Eudora, escorted by the writer
Richard Ford, a native of Jackson and her literary executor,
entered and sat down. She was eighty-six years old, and her body
was bent with osteoporosis, but her white hair was beautifully
done. She wore a dress boldly printed in black and white, with a
long matching scarf that hung from one shoulder. Eudora is truly
admired and loved in Jackson, the town where she was born and grew
up and has lived all her adult life. She has been a good citizen,
happy to help with many worthy causes, leading an apparently
blameless life. She has written four collections of short stories
and five novels, but her most recent novel, the Pulitzer
Prize-winning ``The Optimist's Daughter,'' appeared in 1972, and
she has not published a new short story since 1966. Her memoir,
glowing with remembered happiness, was a best-seller in 1984. She
had been honored in this room before _ in 1973 on Eudora Welty Day,
and again in 1987 when she was named a Chevalier de l'Ordre des
Arts et des Lettres by the French government. Her friends had
turned out in amazing, heartwarming numbers for these events, just

of course does not mean that he was very liberal), pre-

and then other notables.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting up in the gallery, looking down at the invited guests, I
realized that there before my eyes were a great many of the people
I wanted so badly to interview for this biography. That is the fate
of the unauthorized biographer: to be the uninvited guest.
</P>
<P>
   I had been working on a biography of Eudora Welty for two and a
half years and had had to deal with the refusal of her closest
friends to talk to me. They all knew that she did not want a
biography written. I like to think she did not want a biography
written by anybody, and I refused to take her feelings about the
matter personally. But when I used great ingenuity and persistence
in tracking down one of her friends from another era who lived in a
faraway place, the old friend would usually call Eudora. ``I'd
rather you didn't talk to her,'' Eudora always said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather you didn't talk to her.'' These were the only words
she had to say, for Eudora Welty is genuinely loved _ no, adored,
in Jackson and in fact everywhere. She has proved herself a loyal
and generous friend and relative. No wonder she has inspired
unstinting devotion.

housed the Cosmos Club. Atlanta was big on private dining clubs in

 &HT;    COLUMN: Literary Landscapes
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Place is what Eudora Welty once called ``the crossroads of
circumstance,'' the soil from which fiction draws its
particularity. It is one of fiction's ``lesser angels,'' content to
occupy the background while character and plot, among other things,
pass before us like the big floats of the parade.
</P>
<P>
   But it is an essential background nonetheless. Remove it and a
story can only ask us to suspend belief, like a fairy tale or
something out of science fiction. From the start, Welty wrote, the
novel ``has been bound up in the local, the `real,' the present,
the ordinary day-to-day of human experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The everyday, the here and now. Yet if anything has
characterized much Southern fiction, it's been the remote if not
the long removed. One of the most popular novels in years, Charles
Frazier's ``Cold Mountain,'' is set during the Civil War, and
although some who are native to the North Carolina mountains might
recognize familiar flora and fauna, no one would find in it the
``ordinary day-to-day of human experience.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be, indeed probably is, a better novel because it evokes
another time and place, not a world with which we are already too
familiar. Rather than a transcription of today, it is a fable in
which the passing moment can be forgotten and the larger concerns
of the hour _ love and death _ fully considered.
</P>
<P>
   Not every novel, of course, can _ or should _ carry a dateline
that says Eternity. There's something to be said for novels as
simply entertainments. In the stories of writers as accomplished as
Bobbie Ann Mason and Lee Smith, characters go to strip malls, eat
sandwiches made from white bread and Velveeta cheese and make
vigils to Graceland. To the extent that local color gives a story a
certain verisimilitude, they serve their purpose.
</P>
<P>
   But even then, these writers aren't attempting to portray the
contemporary South _ urban and suburban, middle-class and
Republican _ so much as a South that exists on the fringe. Theirs
is a South not fully mainstreamed, only a generation removed from
the hills and fields. In lesser writers, what one critic called
``hick chic'' is taken to be representative of Southern mores and
Southern life _ an instance of caricature being mistaken for the
thing itself.
</P>
<P>
   Other writers make no concession to country charms or a pastoral
past. Tim McLaurin of North Carolina and Larry Brown of Mississippi
both write of men whose money and luck have run out, and sometimes
their women with them. The realism in their novels and short
stories is the kind that comes from having grown up on the outside
and the wrong side.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also a realism that is as much rural as it is
Southern. Indeed, most of Brown's stories could be set just as
easily in southern Ohio, Indiana or Illinois, where peeling paint
and pickups driven by men with a three-day growth are more typical
than anywhere in Cobb County or
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The countrified South evoked in fiction may well be one that
some remember, but seldom is it one that most people can claim to
know. It's as if there were a cultural time lag between what we
read and where we live.
</P>
<P>
   Larry McMurtry addressed this issue once in an encyclical of
sorts on what might apologetically be called the state of letters
in his native Texas. It was a remarkable document, fiercely
intelligent, unsparing and hardly imaginable anywhere else. The
gist of his criticism was that in one of the most populous states
in the country, one with three metropolitan cities larger than 1
million people, Texas writers still slavered to a rural-cowboy
myth:
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only are there few readable city books, but many of the
country books are filled with explicit anti-urbanism. Writer after
writer strains to reaffirm his or her rural credentials. ... Why
are there still cows to be milked and chickens to be fed in every
other Texas book that comes along? When is enough going to be
enough?'' Texas, he said, had more than its share of bucolics.
``What we need is a Balzac, a Dickens, even a Dreiser?''
</P>
<P>
   He himself, a few years earlier, had set one of his most
affecting novels, ``Terms of Endearment,'' in Houston. Despite
that, no modern writer has so successfully resisted his own advice.
When McMurtry's article appeared in the pages of The Texas Observer
in the early '80s, ``The Last Picture Show'' and ``Horseman, Pass
By'' (the movie version settled for the more prosaic, less literary
``Hud'') were more than 10 years behind him. He had moved on, to
paraphrase the title of another of his books, writing novels set
not only in Houston but also Washington and Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   And then _ four years after his call for an end to the myth of
the cowboy _ came ``Lonesome Dove.'' Set aside the fact that its
very purpose was to expose the myth for what it was. It lodged
itself in the imagination, winning McMurtry the Pulitzer Prize and
establishing itself as a Western idyll. Never before had the time
and place we romantically call the Old West been rendered so
lyrically, so permanently alive.
</P>
<P>
   It could not have been done by fidelity to geography alone. If
place, as Welty wrote, is one of the lesser angels ``that watch
benignly over the racing hand of fiction,'' it knows its
subordinate role. While ``character, plot, symbolic meaning, and so
on, are doing a good deal of wingbeating about her chair,'' another
_ feeling _ ``soars highest of them all.''
</P>
<P>
   If it is through place ``that we put out roots, wherever birth,
chance, fate or our traveling selves set us down,'' the
particularity we take from it is useless without the artist's
feeling for something that transcends the everyday. The local stays
local if something larger cannot be seen in it. ``Whatever our
theme in writing,'' as Welty wrote, ``it is old and tried. Whatever
our place, it has been visited by the stranger; it will not be new
again. It is only the vision that can be new, but that is enough.''

 &HT;    Looking for Atlanta
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Tom Wolfe visited Atlanta to research ``A Man in Full,''
his novel about race relations and real estate developers, he
practically salivated over the prime literary territory he
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand why there aren't 20 novels set in
Atlanta,'' he told his friend Mary Rose Taylor at a gathering at
the Margaret Mitchell House.
</P>
<P>
   Others have wondered the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Anne Rivers Siddons' ``Peachtree Road,''
several mystery novels, and, of course, ``Gone With the Wind,''
Atlanta has been largely ignored by the literati.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with Tom Wolfe,'' says St. Simons Island resident and
former Atlantan Tina Mc-
</P>
<P>
   Elroy Ansa, author of ``The Hand I Fan With'' and other novels
about middle-class African-Americans. ``I find contemporary Atlanta
an interesting place, especially the music and entertainment scene.
And it astounds me that no civil rights novels have been written
about the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, Taylor says, Atlanta writers have too much emotional
baggage to write objectively about their hometown. ``Maybe it is
going to take an outsider to capture a true picture of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom has no chip on his shoulder,'' she says. ``There's no
bitterness in the man, like some writers have. If Pat Conroy writes
a sequel to `Gone With the Wind,' as some have reported, he will
have his own baggage. He both loves and hates the South.''
</P>
<P>
   Authors such as Siddons and Terry Kay have set novels in
Atlanta, but they and others are frustrated by what they consider
the city's lack of identity _ a definite handicap for novelists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta has a fabulous energy,'' says Siddons, who is moving
to Charleston in November, ``but it doesn't seem to have the
resonance, the layers of a great city. When I wrote `Peachtree
Road,' it was set in the period between the '40s and '70s. The city
was a whole different place then. For me, I can't think of anything
I would want to write about the city except the families who have
lived through the changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to convey the sense of Atlanta in a novel is ``like
trying to write about an amoeba,'' says Kay, a former Atlantan who
now lives near Athens. Although his December novel, ``The
Kidnapping of Aaron Greene,'' is set in Atlanta, Kay admits being
frustrated with the impermanence of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Street names have been changed since I worked at The Atlanta
Journal in the '60s, and some of the buildings are no longer there.
... Most people outside of Atlanta who read an Atlanta book think
of it as the city that was burned in `Gone With the Wind.' That's
the
</P>
<P>
   image they have, of it not being built, but being burned.
Atlanta is a city that is continually destroying itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Walburn, Atlanta magazine's editor in chief, echoes Kay's
opinion. ``There's no feeling of permanence. To have a great novel,
there has to be something that prevails over a long period of time.
There's no sense of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta crime novelist Robert Coram has an even harsher view of
the city as a literary setting. ``I've done four books located in
Atlanta, all cop novels, which is the best way to show the city's
rancid nature. Other cities have been the locale for serious
novels, but those cities have more substance than Atlanta. Writing
a serious book about Atlanta is like writing about the hole in a
doughnut.''
</P>
<P>
   In the '70s, Bill Diehl set his thriller ``Sharky's Machine'' in
Atlanta, but since then he has relocated to St. Simons Island and
shifted his fiction to other locales. ``Atlanta has changed
radically in the last 10 years. ... I don't want to knock the city
because I consider it my second home, but if you set a book in
Atlanta now, in two years it wouldn't be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Why Atlanta has not enjoyed the literary cachet of cities such
as New Orleans, New York or Chicago may be as simple as pure
chance, says Michael Pearson, the Virginia author of ``Imagined
Places,'' a tour of America's literary landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the luck of the draw,'' Pearson says. ``Writers write
what they know. For Mark Twain, it was Hannibal, Mo., for Faulkner
it was Oxford and for Joyce it was Dublin. For whatever reason,
Atlanta doesn't seem to have drawn as many writers as other cities.
I think Atlanta's a beautiful city, but maybe not one that offers
the complexity that attracts certain writers. But if Faulkner had
been born in Atlanta, he would have written about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe's novel portrays multiple aspects of Atlanta, from
Buckhead to Bankhead, but other authors have found the only way to
digest the city is in small bites. Mystery writer Kathy Hogan
Trocheck admits that at first she was intimidated by the idea of
writing about Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was too sprawling, too unknowable, and that being
a non-native, I didn't have the credentials to tackle it with
confidence,'' says Trocheck, who lives in Avondale Estates. ``Then,
when I created (the character) Callahan Garrity, I knew she lived
in Candler Park, near Little Five Points, which I knew something
about. Before I knew it, I was nibbling at the edges of Atlanta,
neighborhood by neighborhood. Buckhead, Ansley Park, Inman Park,
Midtown, pieces of Cobb County, Oakland Cemetery, the old downtown
Rich's and Roswell.''
</P>
<P>
   With ``Midnight Clear,'' the seventh in the Callahan Garrity
series, Trocheck goes into Clayton County, Jonesboro, Stewart
Avenue and a deserted amusement park called Funtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I got into writing about the geography of Atlanta, I
found it impossible to separate out politics, race, religion, class
and the thing always present in my mind _ the clash of New and Old
South,'' Trocheck says. ``My books are always character driven, but
as Callahan, who is a native Southerner and a native Atlantan,
reveals herself to me, she has slowly revealed a lot about Atlanta
that I guess I must have unconsciously absorbed in the nearly 20
years I've lived here.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Willard, another Atlanta crime novelist, views the city
from an even narrower focus. His debut novel, ``Down on Ponce,'' is
set on the lower end of Ponce de Leon Avenue, a diverse area
anchored by the Majestic, an all-night diner that attracts
characters of all social levels. It is a street rarely frequented
by tourists, Willard says, and therein lies the problem of the
city's image.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, people come here and visit strip malls and suburbs,
and they go away thinking Atlanta is a city of strip malls and
suburbs. Atlanta has an overlay of this very complex racial
history. When you consider the relationships between the population
who have been here and the immigrant population, you have an
incredibly complex social milieu. Atlanta is a place where you
could deal metaphorically with a lot of issues, such as our
evolving cultural identity.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's what Wolfe purports to do in his novel. Whether he
succeeds will be determined when ``A Man in Full'' hits bookstores
Nov. 10, giving Atlantans a chance to judge for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Coram, for one, is anxious to see how deeply Wolfe digs beneath
the surface of Atlanta. ``I wonder if the real guts of the city
have been taken out and stirred and something significant derived,
or he pulled out obvious cosmetic markers and used them as
signposts. If so, people who don't know Atlanta may think he has
captured the soul of the city. And perhaps he has. Sometimes
outsiders do it best.''

 &HT;    COLUMN: Long-forgotten political report a gripping read
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When old friends come out with a new book, it's reason for great
jubilation. Two of my longtime friends collaborated on a book about
Georgia politics, which is a subject dear to my heart, back in the
late 1940s when things at the Capitol were colorful and sometimes
shocking.
</P>
<P>
   That was the period, you remember, when we had a double governor
hiatus _ Ellis Arnall going out of office, Herman Talmadge elected
in the middle of the night with dubious write-in votes to take the
place of his dying father, and M.E. Thompson, our first lieutenant
governor, waiting in the wing for the Supreme Court to act.
</P>
<P>
   Two then-young Georgians, James A. Mackay, a House member from
DeKalb County and later congressman, and Calvin Kytle, an Atlanta
writer, went about the state to try to solve the riddle of
Georgia's fearsomely fascinating politics.
</P>
<P>
   They interviewed political leaders and observers in all 159
counties and presented their report to the fact-seeking
organizations that sent them forth, and it lay in a file until this
year. The University of Georgia Press has brought that report out
in a book called ``Who Runs Georgia?''
</P>
<P>
   I am not sure I know who runs Georgia today, but I read that
book with great admiration for the authors and, I hate to say it,
but pure pleasure in renewing acquaintance with some past rogues
and scoundrels.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't know all the people Calvin and Jamie interviewed, but I
knew some, and I was impressed by the candor with which they spoke
of things such as the necessity for a white primary, the purity of
the disgraceful county unit system and, in many cases, their ease
with demagoguery.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin, who lives in Chapel Hill, N.C., after retiring from his
own Seven Locks Press in Maryland, is coming to town to join Jamie
in a series of panel discussions, parties and autographings.
</P>
<P>
   Emory University is the center of much of this _ out of
admiration for the book, which has been nominated for some
prestigious awards, and because it's a kind of homecoming for the
authors. Jamie was graduated from Emory in 1940, Calvin in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin and Elizabeth Larisey, later married, were among my first
friends in Atlanta. I covered the federal beat, which then
consisted of courts, the military and agencies of all kinds,
including the alphabet agencies of the Roosevelt administration.
They were on the staff of Boisfeulet Jones, who headed the National
Youth Administration with offices in the old Ten Forsyth Street
building.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, Calvin has written many books, as has Liz.
Her ``Willie Mae'' is one of the best I have ever read, and her
book on cats one of the most beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie first drew my admiration when he went to bat for Miss
Loretto Chappell, who headed the children's division of the Welfare
Department and drew the ire of a South Georgia legislator when he
saw among the books on her shelves ``Mein Kampf.'' He wanted her
fired for what she read, although I am certain he had never read
anything at all himself. Jamie rose to her defense, and after a
hearing before the House, she was cleared and returned to her job.
I began to pay attention to the funny and eloquent liberal
gentleman from DeKalb. He and his family have remained friends.
</P>
<P>
   One of the places to see these authors and discuss ``Who Runs
Georgia?'' then and now will be the DeKalb County Courthouse 10
a.m.-3 p.m. Nov. 10. They will autograph at Final Touch bookstore
across from the courthouse starting at 5 p.m. Nov. 10.

 &HT;    `Kane's' innovative brilliance still glitters
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   So what's the big deal about ``Citizen Kane?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, if you've never seen this American classic, directed by
Orson Welles when he was 25 years old, now's your chance to check
it out on the big screen and understand why it ranks No. 1 on
international best-film lists.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after the flaming head in ``The Wizard of Oz'' told
Dorothy to pay no attention to the man behind the curtain, Welles
essentially took the opposite tack. Tracing the life of media
magnate Charles Foster Kane (played by Welles), this
mock-biography-mystery wastes no opportunity to both expose and
celebrate the artificiality of the film medium.
</P>
<P>
   Welles (with cinematographer Gregg Toland) shot scenes in deep
focus, architecturally carving out space and creating symbolic
meaning by the placement of his actors onscreen. You'd be
hard-pressed to find a single shot in the movie that doesn't have
some innovative touch, including snappy editing and trick shots.
(You have to love that over-the-roof-and-through-the-skylight
entrance into the nightclub, where a reporter interviews Kane's
faded second wife, Susan.)
</P>
<P>
   The film also exploits established genre moods, whether it's the
spooky, haunted-house introduction to Xanadu; the two-hanky
melodrama of the confrontation between Kane's first wife and his
mistress; or the pitch-perfect ``News on the March'' parody that
brings us up to speed on the life (and death) of Kane at the film's
start.
</P>
<P>
   While the snazzy camera work constantly reminds you that this is
a movie you're watching, the script is doing the same thing.
Credited to Welles and Herman J. Mankiewicz, it deconstructs
familiar notions of the Hollywood ``hero.'' Our protagonist is a
man who dies alone, a bloated wreck whose last word, ``Rosebud,''
spins the movie forward in its quest to uncover who this
magnificent failure (or failed magnificent) was.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's big irony, of course, is that the reporters never
find out who or what Rosebud was. But we the viewers do.
</P>
<P>
   There's one final irony layered on top of that one: Even with
that puzzle solved, we can't quite explain the enigma of Charles
Foster Kane. The movie remains a mixture of showmanship and
elusiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Citizen Kane'' gained its initial notoriety because of the
character's similarities to newspaper magnate William Randolph
Hearst, down to small details (``rosebud'' was supposedly the
nickname Hearst gave a part of actress girlfriend Marion Davies'
anatomy). The movie innovatively toys with the fine line between
fiction and fact. In this, and in Kane's manipulation of his media
empire, the movie seem weirdly prophetic now, when lines between
public and private life are blurred and tabloid mentality reigns.
Let's just say Charlie Kane would have seen Monica Lewinsky as a
godsend.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing ``Citizen Kane'' lacks is emotional power. For
all its technical brilliance, it remains the work of a 25-year-old.
It has the showy shallowness of someone who hasn't lived life yet.
Co-writer Mankiewicz, who was almost 20 years older than Welles,
probably gave the script its birth-to-death scope. But Welles, who
at that point had suffered none of the reversals that would mark
the rest of his life, didn't have the experience to give the movie
what would have made it perfect: a heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Citizen Kane''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Starring Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten. Directed by Welles.
</P>
<P>

TED HUGHES, BRITAIN'S POET LAUREATE, ONCE MARRIED TO SYLVIA PLATH,
68
</HEADLINE>
   (js) 
 BY SARAH LYALL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Ted Hughes, Britain's poet laureate, who was known as
much for his doomed marriage to the American poet Sylvia Plath as
for his powerful, evocative poetry, replete with symbolism and
bursting with dark images of the Devon countryside in which he
lived, died at home on Wednesday, his British publisher said. He
was 68.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes had been suffering from cancer for about 18 months but
had told only his closest friends and had never discussed details
of his illness, said Matthew Evans, the chairman of Faber and
Faber, Hughes' publisher. ``He felt that being ill was, for him,
very private,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   It was his illness, and his sense that time was running out,
that persuaded Hughes to publish his last work, ``Birthday
Letters,'' a collection of poems about his tempestuous, fragile
relationship with Plath, who committed suicide soon after the two
separated in 1963. After a silence of 35 years, in which Hughes had
steadfastly refused to discuss Plath publicly or to respond to
charges _ leveled in her own work and by her legions of admirers _
that his callousness had led to her death, Hughes' decision to
finally speak out was extraordinary. The book became an
international bestseller, rare for a book of poetry, and was a
personal turning point for Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a piece of work he wanted to get out before he died,''
Evans said in an interview. ``He regarded it as being of personal
importance. It was the nearest thing to an autobiography.''
</P>
<P>
   The book, which drew a sometimes loving picture of a brilliant
but emotionally unstable woman with a passion for suicide that
seemed hard-wired into her very being, was widely praised,
particularly in Britain. Friends of Hughes saw it as a complete
vindication of a man who had lived for decades in the shadow of his
far more famous wife, taking on a guilt that should not have been
his.
</P>
<P>
   But the book did not end the discussion over the strange,
terrible time surrounding Plath's death, already described by her
in her own remarkable poems and journals, jagged cries of pain that
seemed to lay the blame for her troubles squarely on Hughes'
shoulders. Many Plath scholars said that Hughes had asked too much
of his American wife: forcing her to live, without emotional
support, in a cold and dark country even as her mind began to
unravel, and abandoning her and their two small children at a time
when she was clearly crying out for help.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the truth, Hughes, by then ill with the disease that
would kill him, got the last word in the 35-year discussion.
Although he never talked about the poems publicly, saying that he
wanted his work to speak for itself, friends said he felt satisfied
with what ``Birthday Letters'' had accomplished. ``The publication
was a very important moment for him,'' Evans told the Press
Association here. ``He was putting another side, and there was a
great deal of understanding after that book was published.''

 &HT;    A simple request, complex repercussions
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Shadrach'' is the other fall film about the fallout from our
nation's slave heritage. It's the one without the megastar TV talk
show host.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the title role in this modest, graceful picture is
played by John Franklin Sawyer, an 84-year-old retired postal
worker with no previous acting experience.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean the movie is bereft of stars _ try Harvey
Keitel and Andie MacDowell. They play Vernon and Trixie Dabney.
Around 100 years ago, the Dabneys were the most prosperous
plantation owners in the Tidewater region of Virginia. Now _
``now'' being the Depression summer of 1935 _ they are what was
then commonly called ``poor white trash,'' living with their seven
children on a parcel of land straight out of ``Tobacco Road.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where Shadrach, a 99-year-old former slave, ends up after
walking 600 miles from Alabama. He wants to die and be buried on
``Dabney land,'' meaning the remnants of the plantation where Vern
now keeps his moonshine still.
</P>
<P>
   It seems a simple enough request, but it's complicated by racial
prejudice, by a county law forbidding burial on private property
and by Vern's limited finances.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's events are filtered through the eyes of 10-year-old
Paul (Scott Terra), who prefers the ramshackle, free-and-easy
Dabneys to his own stiffly middle-class home, where his ill
mother's cough gets worse every day. Left with the Dabneys while
his parents go to a funeral in Baltimore, he shares their journey
with Shadrach.
</P>
<P>
   The film is based on a William Styron short story written in the
late 1970s and is directed by Styron's daughter, Susanna. She
demonstrates a feeling for people and place that would do her daddy
proud. And she doesn't try to reshape his story into a more
``timely'' apologia for the rancid residue of our country's slave
past. Rather, she concentrates on what was important to her father:
a young boy's (read, Styron's) introduction to the harsh realities
of prejudice, poverty and death.
</P>
<P>
   The plot is hardly the point; it goes exactly where you think it
will. But it does so with an unassuming decency that's refreshing.
Styron takes her time setting up her characters, contrasting the
crystal-and-china dinners at Paul's home with the tethered goat and
junked cars that fill the Dabneys' yard. Keitel's Southern accent
comes and goes, but he nails that stolid, jut-jawed stance of the
disenfranchised Southerner. And his emotional choices rarely
falter. Andie MacDowell is every bit as good as his wife, one of
those soft, slattern-sexy women who always have a beer in their
hand and look as if they've just had sex.
</P>
<P>
   As for Sawyer, his role is almost entirely symbolic (the film's
unsolved weakness). But he has a beautiful face and a comforting
presence; starlets have made entire careers out of less.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's other flaw is a bad choice of narrator. Martin Sheen
reads Styron's prose with an irritating self-awareness, full of
Southern Gothic curlicues. It creates a needlessly dishonest note
in an otherwise scrupulously honest effort.
</P>
<P>
   But overall, Styron gets a lot right. We see a movie theater
with its all-black balcony and all-white main floor, all laughing
together but not allowed to sit together. And it's hard to come up
with a better image of the ugly stupidity of racism than a barely
standing outhouse in the middle of nowhere that still ``proudly''
bears the sign ``Whites Only.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Shadrach''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Harvey Keitel and Andie MacDowell. Directed by Susanna
Styron. Rated PG-13 for language and brief
</P>
<P>
   sexuality. 1 hour, 28 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A well-acted, refreshingly decent small film.

 &HT;    Jokes lose their bite in `Vampires'
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Carpenter's movies are a lot like his career. They show
loads of early promise, then lose steam.
</P>
<P>
   Since he hit it big 20 years ago with the slasher phenom
``Halloween,'' Carpenter's work has been erratic. His films almost
invariably offer something interesting, whether it's the
transformational title character in ``The Thing'' or the demented
comic-book heroics of ``Escape From New York.'' But, unlike
``Halloween,'' which transcended genre by creating its own, his
other films have a B-movie consciousness that's ultimately more
limiting than liberating.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is a very high-flown way of saying that ``John
Carpenter's Vampires'' starts out great and ends up limp. Jack Crow
(James Woods) is a professional vampire-slayer employed by the
Vatican. His entire life has been about stalking _ and staking _
the undead. (In this movie, impalings and sunlight are what work;
crosses and garlic are a waste of time.)
</P>
<P>
   Jack meets his match when he takes on Valek (Thomas Ian
Griffith), a 600-year-old bloodsucker who, according to Jack's
boss, Cardinal Alba (Maximilian Schell), may be the very first
vampire, i.e., the source of the original virus. (Yes, there are
AIDS overtones, plus some explicit links between vampirism and
sex.)
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter quickly and effectively establishes a tone that's both
gruesome and comic. Crow and his team of vampire killers may be in
an unorthodox line of work, but Carpenter presents them as an
amusing mixture of the tornado-chasers in ``Twister'' and a bunch
of Terminix guys. They find a nest and obliterate the inhabitants.
Only they don't use insecticide.
</P>
<P>
   But Carpenter is like a talented but sloppy chef. He tosses in
whatever's at hand, without thinking through how all these
disparate elements will work together. Thus, while Woods' deadpan
tough guy is initially amusing (he calls to mind Tommy Lee Jones in
``Men in Black''), he becomes much less so as the gore, guts and
schoolboy wisecracks accumulate.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he's far more watchable than either of his co-stars.
Daniel Baldwin, who plays Crow's right-hand man, projects little
more than a sad self-awareness that's he's not only less attractive
than his brothers, but also less talented and less successful. Even
worse is Sheryl Lee, whose 15 minutes of ``Twin Peaks'' fame are
long over. Cast as a hooker bitten by Valek, she spends most of the
movie either tied up or twitching uncontrollably. She's looks
distressingly comfortable either way.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Carpenter's Vampires''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Starring James Woods. Directed by John Carpenter. Rated R for
nudity, language, violence and vampire sex. At metro theaters. 1
hour, 47 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: The vampires suck, and so does the movie.

 &HT;    `The Temptations' is good, but shouldn't be presented as a
Hallmark card
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is it just my imagination, or is NBC's sappy musical biography
``The Temptations'' a ball of confusion?
</P>
<P>
   This two-part movie (9 p.m. EST Sunday and Monday) recounts the
doo rag-to-riches history of the Motown masters who recorded
enduring soul classics such as ``Ain't Too Proud to Beg,'' ``Im
Losing You'' and ``How I Wish That It Would Rain.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on a book by founder Otis Williams, the movie is an homage
to the angelic vocals, drop-dead outfits and elegantly precise
dance routines that made the Temps the smooth rulers of '60s R&AMP;B.
</P>
<P>
   But, uh-oh, a quick check of the credits reveals it was produced
by squeaky-clean Hallmark Entertainment, the same company that
grinds out those treacly holiday TV specials every year.
</P>
<P>
   So while the movie trudges dutifully through the drugs, alcohol,
violence and typical show biz excesses that eventually consumed the
original Temptations, their tragedies get the rubber-glove
treatment and feel sanitized. It's like a Kwanzaa card created by
the Osmond Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Although 19 singers have passed through the Temptations'
revolving door in 40 years, the movie wisely spotlights only those
responsible for their distinctive look and sound.
</P>
<P>
   Newcomer Charles Malik Whitfield stars and narrates from the
perspective of Williams, the Temptations' heart and sole survivor
of the original group. DB Woodside plays Williams' best friend,
sad-eyed baritone Melvin Franklin, while Terron Brooks portrays
silky falsetto Eddie Kendricks.
</P>
<P>
   Mimicking the Temptations is a tough assignment and the cast is
earnest, but not memorable. The only standout performance comes
from sexy veteran actor Leon (that's it, just Leon), who co-stars
as David Ruffin. Looking like a king cobra with glasses, he's a
dead ringer for the late, great tenor, who couldn't resist his own
inner temptations.
</P>
<P>
   As for the story, it's tritely familiar: Detroit sidewalk
troubadours calling themselves ``Otis Williams and the Distants''
get discovered in the 1950s, get rich, get mad at each other, split
up, then reunite for a tear-jerking finale.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few scenes manage to hit any high notes, including one in
which the group is trying to concoct a new moniker before
auditioning for Motown honcho Berry Gordy, and a montage in the
second episode that shows them in various stages of career meltdown
set to the tune of ``Papa Was a Rolling Stone.''
</P>
<P>
   But pity the fool who watches ``The Temptations'' for pacing,
plot or production values.
</P>
<P>
   This movie is for anyone who has ever wrecked the harmony to
``My Girl'' while singing in the shower or threw out the back
dancing to ``Psychedelic Shack'' at a house party.
</P>
<P>
   If you're tired of crotch-grabbing vulgarians on MTV whose
lyrics carry parental advisories, just listening to the
Temptations' standards in this loving-but-lopsided tribute will
probably keep you goose bumpy for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C for the movie, B+ for the music

 &HT;    Very civilized infidelity, French style
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The French, they are different. If you find that a cause for
celebration more than suspicion, then ``La Separation'' may well be
your movie. Think of it as a Gallic ``Kramer vs. Kramer.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierre (Daniel Auteuil) and Anne (Isabelle Huppert) seem to have
an ideal life. They've been together a while (though unmarried),
and their toddler son, Loulou, is the focus of their contentment.
But that focus shifts when Anne, after a birthday party, casually
announces, ``I fell in love with someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as casually, Pierre absorbs her words, and life goes on. Or
so it seems. Continuing to share a home, Anne and Pierre tiptoe
through a minefield of unresolved emotion. She can't help glowing,
reveling in the dual attention of two lovers. Pierre, meanwhile,
endures the agony of jealousy, waiting up nights for her return or
semi-intentionally antagonizing her by taking Loulou out for an
afternoon without letting Anne know.
</P>
<P>
   It's all very civilized, except for the inevitable eruptions of
anger; the actors are terrific. For Francophiles, the film's
Parisian textures may offer pleasure enough. For other viewers, it
may feel emotionally stingy, slightly too impressed by its own
bittersweet air.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't help that the sphinxlike Huppert has played so many
morally ambiguous roles, from Flaubert's Emma Bovary to the
self-serving women of ``Story of Women'' and ``Entre Nous.'' She
carries so much cinematic baggage that it's impossible to react to
her Anne simply as a woman rather than as the sum of Huppert's
other screen portrayals.
</P>
<P>
   ``La Separation''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Daniel Auteuil and Isabelle Huppert. Directed by
Christian Vincent. Unrated. 1 hour, 28 minutes. At Lefont Garden
Hills.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A very civilized, very French look at infidelity
and its aftermath.

 LONDON: was published.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ted Hughes was born on Aug. 17, 1930, in Mytholmyrod, a small
mill town in West Yorkshire. When he was 7, his family moved to
Mexborough, a coal mining town to the south, and his father gave up
his old profession of making portable wooden buildings and bought a
newspaper store.
</P>
<P>
   After attending the local elementary school, Hughes served for
two years in the Royal Air Force and then went to Pembroke College,
Cambridge. He was a great success, celebrated as a clever, handsome
student with great personal magnetism and an aura of brooding
mystery that made him particularly attractive to women. Hughes took
a number of jobs to support his writing, including working as a
film script reader for Rank, and later as a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   He met Plath, an American studying at Cambridge, at a party
there in 1956. The attraction was instantaneous. Plath wrote in her
journal: ``That big, dark, hunky boy, the only one there huge
enough for me, who had been hunching around over women, and whose
name I had asked the minute I came into the room, but no one told
me, came over and was looking hard into my eyes and it was Ted
Hughes.''
</P>
<P>
   The two got married just four months later, and the next year,
Hughes published his first volume of poems, ``Hawk in the Rain,'' a
sometimes savage and violent dissection of the natural world, to
great critical acclaim. Though Plath found herself living in the
shadow of her increasingly well-known husband, the two made up a
celebrated literary couple, traveling often and living briefly in
the United States. Their life together in England was less
successful. Plath found the Devon countryside, which her husband
loved, cold, bleak and uninviting. When they moved back to an
unheated, uncomfortable flat before one of Britain's bitterest
winters in half a century, she fared no better. Plath became
distraught, irrational and suicidal, and in 1963, soon after Hughes
left her for his married lover, a fellow poet named Assia Wevill,
Plath put her head in the oven and gassed herself.
</P>
<P>
   Plath's suicide had far-reaching and unexpected consequences. It
drew a blaze of attention to her work, much of which had been
written in a burst of despairing, frenzied creativity in the last
months of her life. She became a feminist icon, celebrated as a
passionately creative woman stifled by the confines of motherhood
and by a husband who betrayed her.
</P>
<P>
   It also put terrible pressure on Hughes, who was vilified by
many for what they saw as his complicity in Plath's death. (It
didn't help that, five years later, Assia Wevill killed herself and
the two-year-old daughter she had had with Hughes, using gas, as
Plath had.) And, as executor of his late wife's estate, Hughes
found himself caught in a thicket of conflicting interests. With
each new volume by Plath that he published _ her journals, her
``Collected Poems,'' which won a posthumous Pulitzer Prize in 1982,
and various volumes of poetry _ he was accused of artfully omitting
parts he found awkward, of acting more like a censor than an
executor. And when he admitted that he destroyed the last volume of
Plath's journals, saying that he didn't want the couple's children
to see them, he unleashed a barrage of criticism that never abated.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, Plath's posthumous fame threatened to
completely overshadow Hughes' own career, particularly in the
United States. Stymied by how fiercely he protected Plath's work _
he often refused to allow the use of quotations from her letters
and poems _ Plath's biographers invariably cast him as the villain
in her life story. When he tried to read his own poetry in public,
his readings were disrupted by pro-Plath protesters who accused him
of murder. Plath's gravestone, which bore her married name, was
repeatedly defaced, the ``Hughes'' chipped off.
</P>
<P>
   But Hughes, who married his second wife, Carol, 29 years ago,
threw himself into his own writing, even as he became increasingly
wary of intrusions into his private life. He produced dozens of
books of poetry and prose, writing for both adults and children.
</P>
<P>
   His poetry has an earthy, lyrical, often violent quality about
it, and often means more than meets the eye. Hughes' poetry, the
critic Tom Paulin once wrote, is to be allowed ``insights into the
secret imaginative life of the nation,'' insights which ``get
obscured by the prying attention that is given to his relationship
with Sylvia Plath.'' Speaking to the Press Association here on
Thursday, the poet Andrew Motion, a longtime friend of Hughes, said
he presented ``a vision of England which managed to bring the whole
of the history and traditional past into play with a present that
his recognizably modern.'' Motion continued: ``On the face of it,
his poems are about animals, nature and wildlife, but careful
reading allows us to see them as a metaphorical or allegorical way
of reconciling past and present.''
</P>
<P>
   The poems in ``Birthday Letters,'' Hughes' often heartbreaking
account of his relationship with Plath, were written much more
simplistically, as straightforward narratives that act almost like
prose. When the book was published, the poet's legion of friends,
who knew him as a loyal and generous friend who was almost bigger
than life, with his imposing physical presence, his strong,
eagle-like face, his enormous, bushy eyebrows and his thatch of
thick unruly hair, said that he had finally succeeded in exorcising
the ghosts of the past.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Hughes was made Britain's Poet Laureate, a prestigious
but rather strange job that pays 70 pounds and a case of wine a
year, and requires the incumbent to write stately poems on solemn
occasions like the Queen Mother's 90th birthday and the death of
the Princess of Wales. He was awarded an Order of the British
Empire in 1977. He won numerous awards for his work over the years,
most recently winning the Whitbread Book of the Year prize in 1997
for ``Tales From Ovid.'' Earlier this month, Hughes became just one
of the 24 holders of an Order of Merit in Britain (new ones are
awarded only when holders of the title die). His acceptance of the
honor, in Buckingham Palace two weeks ago, was his last public
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife and by his two children with Plath,
Frieda and Nicholas.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in 1993, five years before ``Birthday Letters''
was published, Hughes mused about using writing to understand the
past, in language that turned out to be startling prescient. ``It
means the world becomes yours,'' he said. ``If you don't do it, it
drifts away and takes a whole piece of yourself with it, like an
amputation. To attack it and attack it and get it under control _
it's like taking possession of your life, isn't it?''

MCCAIN (Undated) - With his re-election virtually guaranteed, Sen.
John McCain is focusing on building a national fund-raising network
that could provide the backbone for a presidential bid. McCain has
tapped GOP donors from Orange County to New York, raising nearly
$1.5 million from out-of-state contributors who include Microsoft
chairman Bill Gates, real estate tycoon Donald Trump, Time-Warner
vice chairman Ted Turner and the heads of Revlon, CBS and NBC.
Out-of-state contributors constitute about 51 percent of McCain's
individual donor base; another $1.4 million comes from Arizona
supporters. It's a politically potent donor portfolio, but experts
said that if McCain does decide to seek the GOP presidential
nomination, he'll have to work a lot harder. By MICHAEL MURPHY.
Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
ILLEGAL WEDDING (Undated) - Edie Steving and Vern Kildow, both in
their seventies, are getting married. They've known each other
since childhood; he gave her her first kiss at age 14. They each
married someone else, and both spouses died after 50 years of
marriage. What makes this marriage a little different is that Edie
and Vern are first cousins. They say they've checked the laws and
believe the marriage is legal. Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley
says it's against the law in Arizona, but he won't prosecute
because of their age. By KARINA BLAND. Story will move in the ``A''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
LEIBOWITZ-GLENN (Undated) - In the days before liftoff, the days
before I get it, America's latest spectacle impresses me not at
all. Certain catchwords _ space, pioneer, hero, hero, hero _ echo
culturewide. I practice selective deafness, then fight the hype
with a mantra: John Glenn is no hero. By DAVID LEIBOWITZ. Story
will move in the ``K'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
AUTO-REVIEW (Undated) - Although it may not look it, the Chevrolet
Silverado is all new for '99. Replacing the C/K series, it's the
pickup's first significant revamping in 10 years, completely
re-engineered with upgraded engines, transmissions, steering,
suspension, interior, the lot. The result: Silverado is an
exceptionally nice driving truck. Handling, acceleration, comfort,
build quality are all right up there. It's the kind of pickup that
explains succinctly why so many people are abandoning their
passenger cars for trucks. By BOB GOLFEN. Story moved in the ``L''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
FANTASY-FOOTBALL (Undated) - Eight weeks into the NFL season, and
most fantasy owners are thinking just one thing. Where are Mr.
Peabody and the Way Back Machine? With them, we could travel back
to the day of the fantasy draft and correct those little
oversights, like picking Pittsburgh quarterback Kordell Stewart in
the first round, or taking Oakland's Jeff George ahead of San
Francisco's Steve Young. I'm not going even going to mention Jake
Plummer. Oops. By BILL MULLER. Story will move in the ``S''

 By MARC BLOOM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's an overcast, dreary day at Van Cortlandt Park in
the North Bronx, but I'm inspired by a sense of adventure and
nostalgia as I prepare to tackle the running trails that I feared
in my youth.
</P>
<P>
   As I limber up at the start of the 2.5-mile course used every
fall by thousands of high school cross-country racers, I gaze at
the woods in the distance. The trees hide the notorious hills that
tore at my legs in the early '60s while my coach implored me to run
faster with the command, ``C'mon, Bloom, blossom!''
</P>
<P>
   Usually I wilted. But now, cresting 50, I'm not searching for
fast times or such high-charged venues as Sunday's New York
Marathon. Instead, I'm looking for soft footing and a change of
scenery. Like most runners, I've collected too many miles in my
legs on concrete roads, making me susceptible to muscle soreness
and injury. And my familiar running paths have grown tedious. To
give my training a spark, I've returned to my Van Cortlandt roots
for what has become running's newest trend: trail running.
</P>
<P>
   Trail running is done on any lengthy path with a soft surface
like dirt, grass or gravel. If the path is wooded, all the better.
Even in an urban running landscape, trails abound, but you'll
probably have to leave Manhattan. Prospect Park in Brooklyn and
Forest Park in Woodhaven, Queens, have excellent wooded pathways,
as do suburban sites like Bethpage State Park on Long Island, and
Garret Mountain Reservation in West Paterson, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Central Park? Sorry, it's all pavement, except for the crunchy
cinder Reservoir loop and the bridle path, which you'll have to
share with horses and what they leave behind.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing the slippery nature of dirt trails, and the
acquisitive nature of running baby boomers, shoe companies like
Nike, Adidas and New Balance are promoting new lines of
trail-running shoes this year. These heavy-duty models offer better
traction than standard shoes and are, in some cases, water
resistant. They tend to have the clunky feel of cross-trainers.
</P>
<P>
   This day, I'm sticking with my regular training shoes, which
have good treads, and wearing a windbreaker to guard against rain.
So far, everything has gone my way. I made the 65-mile drive from
central New Jersey, over the George Washington Bridge, up the Henry
Hudson Parkway and to the foot of the park in a snappy 75 minutes.
And I got a choice parking spot on upper Broadway, which borders
the park just past 242nd Street, the end of the subway line that we
took from Sheepshead Bay High School in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The park's 1,146 acres, bought in the late 1600s by the Van
Cortlandts, a wealthy Dutch family, are a magnet for runners of all
levels and inclinations. They range from casual joggers to
marathoners to the high school teams that come from all parts of
the Northeast and as faraway as California to compete. Years before
he won three New York City marathons, Alberto Salazar came down
from the Boston area to run high-school events at Van Cortlandt. On
a fall Saturday, school buses clog Broadway, and you may have to
trek up near the Fieldston School or Manhattan College to find a
parking spot.
</P>
<P>
   For on-site guidance and camaraderie, one may speak with the Van
Cortlandt Park Track Club, which celebrated its 20th anniversary
last year. The club, 100 strong, holds weekly group runs.
Nonmembers are welcome, and all paces are accommodated. None of the
park's hubbub is evident as I click my runner's watch, leave the
start line and set out across the opening flats toward the hilly
trails. Barely a soul is around; just a guy hitting golf balls. I
treasure the simple beauty of Van Cortlandt and its history as a
running mecca. To me, the course is steeped in antiquity, a running
museum preserving tradition.
</P>
<P>
   And then, reaching the Cowpath into the hills, I see it, the new
and controversial symbol of the modern age: a coating of gravel
mixed in with the dirt, completed last year by the Parks
Department. The path is now smoother and safer. Rocks and boulders
have been removed. Runners won't trip or sprain or break an ankle.
While the trail is no less authentic, purists bark that their turf
has been gentrified.
</P>
<P>
   I prefer the more secure surface, which still gives under foot.
And the hills are still there. I pass the left-hand turnoff to the
infamous, searing Cemetery Hill, where the Van Cortlandts are
buried. Unless you're feeling cocky, don't take this turn; it's
part of the five-mile course used by college runners. I proceed
straight on the high-school route, hitting the first hill, a short
but steep incline about a mile out.
</P>
<P>
   I can recall, at this juncture, bunches of teammates cheering,
but I'm alone, except for evidence of four-footed runners. In the
1970s, a territorial dispute flared between horseback riders from
the Van Cortlandt stables and the runners. They made a tenuous
peace, but in certain spots I still have to watch where I plant my
feet.
</P>
<P>
   I make a sharp right across a bridge to the secluded Back Woods.
I'm humming along, as if the lead had been taken out of my legs.
The path is six to eight feet wide, with periodic wooden planks set
like railroad ties for added traction. A birdwatcher passes by,
then a young runner going much faster than I, then a pair of
walkers. I feel safe, but I would advise women to run in groups.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The hills don't seem as torturous as they once did. Everything
about the course seems smaller, more manageable. Maybe it's my slow
pace. I'm having a ball running through the woods. I notice the
familiar graffiti cheers painted on trees to urge on the runners.
You can't stray from the prescribed route. Arrows mark the course,
as do new tortoise-and-hare symbols.
</P>
<P>
   One handwritten tree sign reads, ``I can.'' You bet.
</P>
<P>
   I reach the narrow crossroad marking the end of the uphills and
start of the downhills. As a youth, I would envision this juncture,
pleading for it to come. I steady myself on the sharp descents,
taking stutter steps to maintain balance. Soon, I hit Roller Derby
Turn, a sweeping half-mooner now fortified with a stronger,
protective fence to catch the reckless.
</P>
<P>
   My pace picks up, and I'm clear of the woods and onto a brief
concrete stretch, where in competition you can hear the chorus of
spiked shoes clicking against the ground. I remember an aching
slowness to the beat as drained runners fought fatigue with the
race almost over.
</P>
<P>
   I head back over the bridge and down a final descent to the
homestretch. Be careful of the fork in the road. Bear right for the
college course as well as the 5-kilometer (3.1-mile) finish. Go
left for the 2.5-mile high school windup.
</P>
<P>
   I swing left, into the light of the broad expanse of fields,
covered on weekends with a tapestry of soccer, football and rugby
games. Once, rugby players, not known for their diplomacy,
prevented a college championship race from getting under way by
refusing to halt their game. A running official in a three-piece
suit negotiated a peaceful settlement with the mud-encrusted men,
and the race went on.
</P>
<P>
   The homestretch is about a quarter-mile, but in the throes of a
race could seem endless. Teammates on the sidelines would scream
for me to push, push, push. I would try; but with my fight gone,
I'd just pray for that finish line to appear. Now it's a lark. I
stride the final yards to the end in a blissful sweat. I check my
watch: just over 22 minutes. I wonder: If I'd gone all out, could I
have beaten my best high school time of 17 and change?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe some other time. I jog a cool down, past the same guy
swatting golf balls, to make the run an even half-hour. I stop at
my car to get a water bottle and an orange and walk over to a
tortoise-and-hare statue, part of the site refurbishment. An
inscription on the statue reads, ``Slow and steady wins the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Devouring the orange, just as I did after high-school races, I
realize how much I've missed these wonderful old trails, and I feel
that my running, after all these years, is ready to blossom.
</P>

 &HT;    BUENOS AIRES TALKS: HEAT, A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE
 &HT;    With WARMING-PROS, WARMING-CONS, WARMING-INDUSTRIES and
WARMING-DATA. For release Saturday, Oct. 31.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although global satellite data indicate 1998 is the
Earth's hottest year since records have been kept, negotiators who
resume world climate change talks Monday in Buenos Aires,
Argentina, will be less concerned with heat than with a rock and
hard place.
</P>
<P>
   The rock is the determination by developing countries,
especially India and China, to hang on to provisions in last year's
Kyoto Protocol that cut them a break in scheduling reductions in
the gases thought to be causing the Earth to heat up.
</P>
<P>
   And the hard place is the U.S. Senate, which has served nearly
unanimous notice that the protocol won't win ratification unless
changes are made to require ``meaningful participation'' by those
same countries.
</P>
<P>
   Without ratification by the United States, by far the world's
largest producer of the so-called ``greenhouse gases,'' a worldwide
treaty to get control of the climate is unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   The Buenos Aires meeting is known formally as the ``Fourth
Session of the Conference of Parties is to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change.'' The third session, held
last year in Kyoto, Japan, produced the Kyoto Protocol.
</P>
<P>
   Although next week's meeting is being described as a
``fill-in-the-spaces'' session to flesh out the Kyoto agreement,
the United States now takes the position that developing countries
must increase their participation in the emission reductions.
</P>
<P>
   With the two sides apparently digging in on the question of
whether the developing world should be held to rigid schedules for
greenhouse gas reduction, even some environmentalists wondered on
the eve of the Buenos Aires talks if the Kyoto process is not dead
in the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadly, the past 12 months have turned the Kyoto conference
into a kind of high-water mark, from which the climate negotiations
have steadily retreated in the past year,'' said Christopher
Flavin, senior vice president of the Worldwatch Institute, an
environmental and natural resources research group.
</P>
<P>
   ``By creatively papering over wide differences between various
countries, the Kyoto negotiators may have crafted an agreement that
is barely workable in the best of circumstances, and in the current
political climate could lead to paralysis.''
</P>
<P>
   Television commercials purchased by labor and industry groups
headed by the American Petroleum Institute have featured scissors
clipping Mexico, China, India and other countries out of a map to
emphasize as unfair the Kyoto agreement to require greater and
faster reductions in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by
developed countries.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the protocol point out that on a per-capita bases,
residents of industrial countries such as the United States and
Germany use many times as much fossil fuel, the source of more than
900 billion tons of carbon dioxide that has been added to the
atmosphere this century, as citizens of countries like India or
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``These talks are made all the more important by the
accumulation of data reconfirming the threat and the extreme
weather events of the last year,'' said Daniel Lashof, a climate
scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council. He cited the
``unprecedented wildfires in Florida in June and the brutal heat
wave in Texas during July.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics of the protocol point out that no scientist can
connect those events _ or floods in China that displaced an
estimated 56 million people, fires in the Amazon basin or Mexican
fires that sent smoke over much of Texas and as far north as
Chicago _ to a global warming trend.
</P>
<P>
   Without firmer scientific evidence, the Kyoto protocol is an
unfair agreement that will cost Americans jobs, income and economic
output for questionable reasons, they say.
</P>
<P>
   A report issued last week by the United Mine Workers of America
argued that as now written, the protocol will result in the loss of
between 1.3 million and 1.7 million jobs by 2005 and reduce gross
domestic product by a cumulative $1.5 trillion by 2012.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., a supporter of action against
climate change, said last week that a solution, or at least part of
a solution, to the standoff may lie with the more developed
countries in the developing world, such as Argentina, the host
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look for the statement (Argentine) President (Carlos) Menem
makes to the conference,'' Lieberman said, adding that meaningful
action by such countries could at least defuse much of the
unfairness criticism.

 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ America Online Inc., the nation's largest online
service, and SBC Communications Inc., the second biggest telephone
operating company, on Thursday challenged the planned merger of
AT&AMP;T Corp. and TCI Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Both challengers, eager to make sure they are allowed to sell
their services over TCI's coaxial cables, asked the Federal
Communications Commission to permit the merger only under certain
conditions. They want the FCC to apply the same regulations for
cable TV that now apply to telephone companies.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC currently requires that phone companies, or common
carriers, allow consumers to have access to any Internet provider
they choose. This allows the 25 million U.S. Internet subscribers
with telephone connections to select from among numerous providers
such as AOL, Erols, Mindspring and BowieNet.
</P>
<P>
   However, cable TV operators aren't subject to that FCC
requirement. As a result, an estimated 300,000 consumers who gain
access to the Internet through cable TV hook-ups are forced to use
their cable company's preferred Internet provider _ usually Time
Warner's Road Runner or At Home, which is partly owned by TCI.
</P>
<P>
   SBC, based in San Antonio, complained that the planned merger
would present ``significant threats to competition'' unless the FCC
intervenes. SBC wants to be able to provide its voice and data
services over the merged AT&AMP;T-TCI combine.
</P>
<P>
   AOL, headquartered at Dulles, Va., also urged the FCC to require
AT&AMP;T to allow any competitor to provide Internet access over TCI's
cables.
</P>
<P>
   When the TCI merger was announced June 24, AT&AMP;T officials said
the combination would allow customers one-stop shopping _ Internet
access, e-mail, local and long distance telephone services, high
speed data transmission _ all through cable TV hookups and all
itemized on one monthly bill at a low cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``TCI will give AT&AMP;T a path into almost one-third of all
American homes, but more than that it will give us the ability to
exploit the convergence of the TV, PC, and the telephone to create
a whole new generation of communications, information and
entertainment services,'' said C. Michael Armstrong, AT&AMP;T's
chairman and CEO.
</P>
<P>
   TCI, of Engelwood, Colo., is the nation's second largest cable
TV provider, supplying service to approximately 14 million homes in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T and TCI have said that they would permit competitors access
to its cables, but AOL and SBC are seeking government guarantees.
The emergence of cable and wireless communications companies
offering access to the Internet _ circumventing traditional phone
circuits _ poses a threat to AOL's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   If the AT&AMP;T-TCI merger is approved by federal regulators without
guarantees that would allow AOL and others to provide Internet
services over TCI's coaxial cables, AOL officials believe they may
lose marketshare and consumers may lose choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``What AOL is seeking here is government assurances that it will
have access,''said Gary Arlen, president of Arlen Communications, a
telecommunications consulting firm in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC's deadline for comments on the proposed merger was
Thursday. The commission might not decide on the merits of the
merger until next spring. In addition, the Justice Department is
examining the merger for anti-trust implications.
</P>
<P>
   FCC Chairman William Kennard has expressed his hope that the
merger would open up local telephone markets to competition by
allowing AT&AMP;T to provide phone service, data transmission and
Internet access over the same cables that provide movies and
television shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see if AT&AMP;T is committed to investing in advanced
facilities and competing head-to-head with local phone companies to
provide high-speed voice and data to the home,'' Kennard said.
``That's what makes this deal thinkable.''
</P>
<P>
   The merger would only be approved ``if there are tangible
consumer benefits,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd Peterson, a telecommunications analyst with the
Boston-based Yankee Group, said there would be such benefits,
including competition in local phone markets, which are dominated
by the so-called baby Bells.
</P>
<P>
   A main goal of the landmark Telecommunications Act of 1996 was
increased competition in local markets.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, said Boyd, AT&AMP;T's merger would allow the company to
reach at least 14 million households wired by TCI and say, ``Look,
you don't have to deal with your local phone company anymore. You
can deal with us and get a whole package of services that you get
today and we'll do it better and cheaper.''
</P>
<P>
   At the local level, cable TV franchise authorities are worried
that the merger of a phone company and a cable company might create
regulatory confusion as an increasing number of services other than
video are provided over cables.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the concerns, said Susan Littlefield, the cable
regulatory administrator for the city of St. Louis, the emerging
consensus from local governments is that the merger is a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost every franchise authority I have talked with, both big
and small, believes that the merger will give cable systems more
capital to upgrade,'' she said, adding that AT&AMP;T is expected to
improve TCI's checkered customer service reputation.

AOL, SBC CHALLENGE MERGER OF COMMUNICATIONS GIANTS AT&AMP;T AND TCI

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ America Online Inc., the nation's largest online
service, and SBC Communications Inc., the second biggest telephone
operating company, on Thursday challenged the planned merger of
AT&AMP;T Corp. and TCI Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Both challengers, eager to make sure they are allowed to sell
their services over TCI's coaxial cables, asked the Federal
Communications Commission to permit the merger only under certain
conditions. They want the FCC to apply the same regulations for
cable TV that now apply to telephone companies.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC currently requires that phone companies, or common
carriers, allow consumers to have access to any Internet provider
they choose. This allows the 25 million U.S. Internet subscribers
with telephone connections to select from among numerous providers
such as AOL, Erols, Mindspring and BowieNet.
</P>
<P>
   However, cable TV operators aren't subject to that FCC
requirement. As a result, an estimated 300,000 consumers who gain
access to the Internet through cable TV hook-ups are forced to use
their cable company's preferred Internet provider _ usually Time

CROWDS SEND PRAYERS INTO HEAVENS WITH HERO GLENN, DISCOVERY
ASTRONAUTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATTI MUCK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TITUSVILLE, Fla. _ There were goosebumps, teary eyes and
pounding hearts, crossed fingers, breaths held and finally,
prayers.
</P>
<P>
   Well-wishers and tourists, young and old, gathered on roadsides
and beaches by the thousands Thursday to watch the shuttle
Discovery push skyward with U.S. hero John Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   For miles up and down Florida's east coast, it became one big
party and one big parking lot as people took off time from school,
work and life's routine to be a part of the biggest launch to hit
Cape Canaveral in years.
</P>
<P>
   On a crowded seawall, spectators counted down, ``Five, four,
three, two, one,'' before an avalanche of cheers, clapping and
emotion swept along the Indian River, a prime viewing site several
miles from the Cape Canaveral area launch pad. Every head craned to
watch the shuttle disappear in a blaze of smoke and fire.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Troxell's eyes filled with tears as her daughters, ages 7
and 10, watched their first space shuttle launch with her and their
dad, Mike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is important, being part of history,'' said the
36-year-old store manager from Boca Raton. Like others watching the
sky, Troxell's thoughts focused on 77-year-old Glenn and his return
to space. Glenn was the first American to orbit the Earth in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope his health is good, and I hope he's up to this. I wish
him good luck. I wonder what he's feeling right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Her oldest daughter, Katie, plainly put into words what everyone
was thinking as the rocket shed its boosters and climbed into outer
space.
</P>
<P>
   ``No problems. Cool!'' Katie commented after admitting to being
a little frightened and a little impatient during a brief launch
delay. ``It looks like a star.''
</P>
<P>
   Right behind her, Orlando salesman Michael Shorb, 29, figured he
knew what Glenn was thinking, and he quoted what the retiring U.S.
senator might say as he soared into space: ``I told you I'd be
back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great, awesome!'' Shorb said as his family packed up to
face the traffic along U.S. 1 in Titusville. ``It made you feel
pretty patriotic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was fabulous,'' said Patrick Simeone, 79, of
Stuart, Fla. The retired construction worker said the tension
leading up to launch ``was enough to drive me to drinking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wished I was him,'' he said of Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got goosebumps all over my body,'' said Shannon Haagsma, 33,
a production assistant for a Christian television network. ``We
were all in awe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking, `Please make it keep going, please make it
keep going,' '' said her brother, Mark Haagsma, 30, a mortgage
broker. Referring to the shuttle Challenger explosion in 1986, a
topic on many spectators' minds, Haagsma said there would be no way
to explain a similar tragedy to his 5 1/2-year-old nephew,
Dominick, who shot off a model rocket while waiting for the real
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel this is the beginning of the new space program,'' said
Saratoga, N.Y., resident Mark Elliott, 33, a sales representative
for a technical furniture manufacturer. He and his wife, JoAnn,
brought their 7-year-old son to watch the launch from the banks of
the Indian River, about eight miles as the crow flies from the
launch site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought this was the perfect opportunity to really see an
event of a lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   His son, Matthew, wore a T-shirt emblazoned with the Green
Knights, a Marine emblem, in honor of Glenn. He was excited to see
the launch, but also looking to the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to seeing the astronauts go to Mars, then
Jupiter, then Saturn,'' the boy said.
</P>
<P>
   Ben and Laura Miller of New Port Richey , Fla., began their day
with a hot air balloon ride then drove across the state to watch
the launch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gee, I hope everything goes well,'' said Ben Miller, 40, a
wheelwright. ``It would tear my heart out if it didn't.
Everything's so perfect right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple watched as five airplanes spelled out ``Godspeed John
Glenn'' in the blue skies over Titusville.
</P>
<P>
   At the T-shirt and souvenir stands along U.S. 1 in Brevard
County, sales were brisk as excitement grew in the hours leading up
to the launch. Holland visitor Pascal Kwakman, 22, an intern at The
Bond Hotel in St. Petersburg, said his boss told him to ``go, this
is the chance of a lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   To watch the launch was one of his wishes. ``Like every little
boy, I wanted to be an astronaut,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And although he said ``sending an old man up there'' was an
American publicity stunt, ``It was one of the nicest publicity
stunts I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the U.S. Postal Service got into the act, setting up a tent
in a parking lot to sell the recently released Space Discovery
commemorative stamps and provide a free cancellation stamp with the
shuttle outline reading ``John Glenn Returns to Space.'' People
stood in line to get the stamp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only place it's being done,'' said Titusville
Postmaster Ed Link . ``It's a real unique thing, and we'll offer
this for 30 days.''
</P>
<P>
   With a crowd estimate ranging from 250,000 to 400,000 in the
coastal cities leading into Cape Canaveral, locals couldn't resist
a chance to earn a buck. Parking spots were selling from $10 to $20
and higher for recreational vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Some Titusville High School students got an excused absence on
launch day to sell parking spaces. Their goal: to raise $10,000 to
get their gym air-conditioned. And even though launches are as
common to them as yawns in science class, they realized the
significance of this launch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad to see an elderly person go up there to do something
active,'' said Brian Conboy, 16, a sophomore. ``I'll be 77 some
day, and I hope I'm in that good a shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the coast, Max Serakas, 12, of Stuart, Fla., watched the
launch with his father and two grandfathers. The expert model
rocket launcher has seen many rockets blast off, but Glenn's return
to space was a reason to take off school.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a space hero,'' Serakas said. ``I think about the
possibility of me going up someday.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Mick Buffum dozed off behind the wheel at about 2:30 a.m.
on April 4, his 1994 Chevrolet Cavalier drifted off the right side
of the road, ran up a cable used to brace a utility pole and
flipped onto its right side. Buffum, stunned and confused,
unbuckled his seat belt and promptly fell down into the passenger
side of the car. He could not figure out how to get out.
</P>
<P>
   He was alone on a quiet country road outside Marilla, N.Y., near
Buffalo. But suddenly, an Erie County emergency dispatcher was
talking to him over the car's cell phone, even though Buffum had
not even thought to place the call. ``I go, `The car's on its
side,' and he goes, `I know,' '' Buffum said, recalling the
conversation. ``I said, `I can't get the door open,' and he said,
`Can you roll the window down?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Buffum, who followed the unseen dispatcher's advice and escaped
from his wrecked car, had just provided a real-world crash test of
an experimental system that advocates say could save lives in rural
areas like his, on the outskirts of Buffalo, where drivers whose
cars leave the road sometimes die of injuries or exposure before
anyone finds them. In a federally sponsored experiment, Buffum's
car was one of about 600 equipped with a cellular phone and a
receiver for the global positioning system. Such receivers are now
common in car navigation systems.
</P>
<P>
   The phone and the GPS receiver _ which fixes its location to
within a few yards by receiving signals from a network of
satellites _ along with three crash sensors, had been wired
together by Calspan Operations, a transportation technology company
based in Buffalo. The system was set up to dial 911 in case of an
accident; thus the dispatcher knew where the car was and at what
angle it had come to rest. The dispatcher sent emergency vehicles,
knowing from the conversation with Buffum that there was only one
victim and that he was not severely hurt; in other circumstances,
the dispatcher might have sent out several ambulances.
</P>
<P>
   Buffum, of South Wales, N.Y., who works in a machine shop at a
plant that makes aerospace parts, was impressed. He sent Calspan a
letter thanking the company and apologizing ``for any swear words''
that the cell phone might have captured.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials are impressed, too. ``It shows what
intelligent transportation systems can do for you,'' said Mortimer
Downey, the deputy secretary of transportation. But it is too early
to say what final form such systems might take, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buffum would have survived without the Automated Collision
Notification system, but others could have been saved by it,
experts say. ``How many times have you read about somebody who went
off the road, and hopefully two days later they wake up?'' Downey
said, adding that if they did not wake up, they might not be found.
</P>
<P>
   Erie County Sheriff Patrick Gallivan described the system as
being ``like Dick Tracy with the telephone on his wrist.'' He said
that almost every winter, someone skidded off a road and
disappeared into a snowbank or down a hill and died before the car
was discovered. And often if someone with a cell phone discovers an
accident on a rural road, the person calls for help from the scene,
but does not know precisely where the scene is. ``It's just a
matter of time,'' he said, before equipment like the kind that
helped Buffum is standard on new cars.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment is operated by the National Highway
Transportation Safety Administration, along with Cellular One, the
phone company; Datumtech Corp., a supplier of automotive electronic
equipment, three Erie County agencies and Calspan, a unit of
Veridian Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment parallels a commercial offering by General Motors
called Onstar. That system, now in place in about 30,000 vehicles,
costs about $1,300 to install, plus a charge of $12.50 a month on
most GM models. If the air bag deploys, the system calls a central
number in the Detroit area, and a dispatcher there will come on the
phone and ask if help is required. If the dispatcher cannot get an
answer from the occupants of the car, the dispatcher calls the
local police.
</P>
<P>
   While Onstar is marketed as a safety device, it is also
available in nonemergencies, for help with road directions, or for
finding the nearest service station or restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The Calspan system could eventually be expanded, experts say, to
integrate it with car registration data. The dispatcher might then
know who the owner of the car was, and possibly even who the driver
was, even if he or she was unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   The Calspan system has another feature, a crash recorder a
little like the ``black boxes'' that keep track of events leading
up to an airplane crash. It notes how hard the car had accelerated
up or down, left or right and forward or back.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dietrich Jehle, director of emergency services at the Erie
County Medical Center, said the system would be used to match crash
types with injury types, and find out what kinds of crashes were
most likely to cause serious injury or death. That could help
dispatchers send the right level of help in an emergency, he said,
and eventually be fed back to automobile companies to design safer
cars.
</P>
<P>
   Another researcher, Anthony Billetteri, co-director of
transportation injury research at the University of Buffalo, said
the plan was to develop data on ``the signature of a crash that is
likely to produce those kinds of injuries that require dramatic and
immediate assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some very serious crashes, people walk away from,'' he said.
``Some very minor crashes kill people. There's not a lot of
correlation between crash severity and injury severity.''

together by Calspan Operations, a transportation technology company
based in Buffalo. The system was set up to dial 911 in case of an
accident; thus the dispatcher knew where the car was and at what
angle it had come to rest. The dispatcher sent emergency vehicles,
knowing from the conversation with Buffum that there was only one
victim and that he was not severely hurt; in other circumstances,
the dispatcher might have sent out several ambulances.
</P>
<P>
   Buffum, of South Wales, N.Y., who works in a machine shop at a
plant that makes aerospace parts, was impressed. He sent Calspan a
letter thanking the company and apologizing ``for any swear words''
that the cell phone might have captured.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials are impressed, too. ``It shows what
intelligent transportation systems can do for you,'' said Mortimer
Downey, the deputy secretary of transportation. But it is too early
to say what final form such systems might take, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buffum would have survived without the Automated Collision
Notification system, but others could have been saved by it,
experts say. ``How many times have you read about somebody who went
off the road, and hopefully two days later they wake up?'' Downey
said, adding that if they did not wake up, they might not be found.
</P>
<P>
   Erie County Sheriff Patrick Gallivan described the system as
being ``like Dick Tracy with the telephone on his wrist.'' He said
that almost every winter, someone skidded off a road and
disappeared into a snowbank or down a hill and died before the car
was discovered. And often if someone with a cell phone discovers an
accident on a rural road, the person calls for help from the scene,
but does not know precisely where the scene is. ``It's just a
matter of time,'' he said, before equipment like the kind that
helped Buffum is standard on new cars.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment is operated by the National Highway
Transportation Safety Administration, along with Cellular One, the
phone company; Datumtech Corp., a supplier of automotive electronic
equipment, three Erie County agencies and Calspan, a unit of
Veridian Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment parallels a commercial offering by General Motors
called Onstar. That system, now in place in about 30,000 vehicles,
costs about $1,300 to install, plus a charge of $12.50 a month on
most GM models. If the air bag deploys, the system calls a central
number in the Detroit area, and a dispatcher there will come on the
phone and ask if help is required. If the dispatcher cannot get an
answer from the occupants of the car, the dispatcher calls the
local police.
</P>
<P>
   While Onstar is marketed as a safety device, it is also
available in nonemergencies, for help with road directions, or for
finding the nearest service station or restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The Calspan system could eventually be expanded, experts say, to
integrate it with car registration data. The dispatcher might then
know who the owner of the car was, and possibly even who the driver
was, even if he or she was unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   The Calspan system has another feature, a crash recorder a
little like the ``black boxes'' that keep track of events leading
up to an airplane crash. It notes how hard the car had accelerated
up or down, left or right and forward or back.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dietrich Jehle, director of emergency services at the Erie
County Medical Center, said the system would be used to match crash
types with injury types, and find out what kinds of crashes were
most likely to cause serious injury or death. That could help
dispatchers send the right level of help in an emergency, he said,
and eventually be fed back to automobile companies to design safer
cars.
</P>
<P>
   Another researcher, Anthony Billetteri, co-director of
transportation injury research at the University of Buffalo, said
the plan was to develop data on ``the signature of a crash that is
likely to produce those kinds of injuries that require dramatic and
immediate assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some very serious crashes, people walk away from,'' he said.
``Some very minor crashes kill people. There's not a lot of
correlation between crash severity and injury severity.''

     THE WAR THAT DIDN'T END ALL WARS
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sixty years ago today, the broadcast of  &UR; Orson Welles &LR; ' radio
drama ``The War of the Worlds'' caused an American panic. Many
terrified listeners believed the country had been invaded by
Martians.  &UR; Jerry Nachman &LR; 's new book, ``Raised on Radio''
(Pantheon; $28.50), describes some of the hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times said it received 875 phone calls inquiring
whether the invasion had been real and ``at least a score of adults
required medical treatment for shock and hysteria.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Associated Press bureaus were beset with terrorized callers,''
writes Nachman. ``Sobbing women called the Providence Journal with
eyewitness accounts, and a woman in Boston told the Globe she
`could see the fire' set by the Martians.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the major casualty of the misperception was a broken
arm suffered by a woman who fell while running, a serious finger of
blame was pointed at the medium. Welles apologized the next day,
saying, ``I had every hope that the people would be excited as they
would be at a melodrama. But radio is new, and we're learning about
the effect it has on people. We learned a terrible lesson last
night.''

</P>
<P>
   ``The president and I locked eyes,'' she wrote of her first
introduction, ``and he took my hand in both of his, guiding me
closer to him. His hands were softer than I expected. His eyes were
intense and intimate. I could barely concentrate, but I didn't
blink.''
</P>
<P>
   She muttered something about not being able to breathe. ``He
smiled and laughed, still not letting go of my hand, and now
holding my elbow with his left hand underneath the huge sleeve of
my kimono, me wondering where my dad had gone. Somehow the
president flipped me around for a photograph with me between
himself and Hillary, all of our arms wrapped around one another.''
</P>
<P>
   At a White House reception the next day, ``the president looked
over in my direction, did a double take, smiled and made a motion
with his hand for me to come to him.'' An aide whispered in her ear
to stand still, that the president would come to her. A few seconds
later, he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``He remembered me. He hugged me, a bear hug I would expect from
someone leaving the country, not saying hello for a second time.
... `I hope you'll come and visit us in California,' he said.''
</P>
<P>
   Four months later, in another receiving line, he was
``distracted and unfocused,'' his testimony to  &UR; Kenneth Starr &LR;  days
away.

ON STAGE AND OFF: `FOOTLOOSE' SHOWS VIGOR; UNUSUAL EQUITY MOVE;
ENOUGH IS TOO MUCH; WHAT AN ENDING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ All along, ``Footloose'' bore the signs of a
potential ``Carrie''-sized disaster. First, the tryout run in
Washington was a critical bust, and then when the show got to New
York the set didn't fit into the theater. Dancers were injured, an
actor was replaced, and even the poster design _ a giant pink F _
seemed ominous.
</P>
<P>
   But despite this and generally dismissive newspaper reviews, the
musical has shown surprising vigor since opening on Oct. 22. As of
Wednesday, the show's weekly gross was more than $525,000, with
average daily wraps, or box-office receipts, running just under
$100,000, the producers say. (The show's weekly running cost is an
estimated $350,000.)
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, the largest wrap was Oct. 23, the day most of the
worst reviews ran, when sales topped $120,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're doing fantastic, better than most expected,'' said
Ronald Lee, president of Group Sales Box Office, a ticket sales
service. ``It's encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the buzz, to be sure, has been manufactured. The
producers have already spent nearly $1 million to market
``Footloose,'' most of it on radio and television advertisements.
New radio spots with snippets of what good reviews the show had hit
the air just hours after the opening.
</P>
<P>
   Producers are wasting no time exporting their product. The
show's touring company, which was cast before the Broadway run
opened, will begin rehearsals in two weeks, with an opening in
Cleveland planned for mid-December.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket sales on the road also indicate that ``Footloose'' may
have some commercial legs; about 80 percent of tickets have been
sold for performances in Cincinnati and Green Bay, Wis., the
producers say, where single tickets are being bought directly by
curious customers rather than through subscriptions.
</P>
<P>
   The production, which cost $6.5 million, has deep pockets; its
main producer is Dodger Endemol Theatricals, known for salvaging
such critical pariahs as ``Titanic'' with advertising and
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even the producers say it is far too early to handicap
the show's staying power on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's premature to speculate,'' said Michael David, one
producer, picking his words carefully. ``But I'm very optimistic at
this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Unusual Equity Move
</P>
<P>
   The decision last week by Actors Equity to extend its agreement
with the producers of ``The Beauty Queen of Leenane'' to allow the
Irish actress Anna Manahan to stay in the cast through March, was a
good example of the politics _ and economics _ at play on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   The union has final say on how long foreign actors can perform
in the United States, a contentious issue that promises to surface
several times this season as British imports arrive on Broadway.
Alan Eisenberg, the executive director of the union, called the
extension _ the show's third _ ``very unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said Ms. Manahan's presence was needed to keep the show
open and to preserve the eight Equity jobs for the play's other
actors, understudies and stage managers. ``We want to keep the show
running,'' he said. ``The critics close enough of them anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Manahan plays the toadish mother. The other three Irish cast
members will leave ``Beauty Queen'' early next year. In their
place, Kate Burton is expected to play the beleaguered daughter
Maureen, Stevie Ray Dallimore will take the role of Pato, her
suitor, and Chris Carley the part of Pato's dim-witted brother.
</P>
<P>
   Enough Is Too Much
</P>
<P>
   It seemed like a swell idea. About two weeks ago, Mandy Patinkin
was approached by an elderly woman after a performance of
``Mamaloshen,'' his concert of Yiddish folk songs at the Belasco
Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``This little old lady looked at me, after I sang my guts out,
and said, `So, you don't think you could give me a little more than
an hour?' '' Patinkin recalled.
</P>
<P>
   So last Thursday he took off his formal wear, his usual costume
for the show; put on a pair of tennis shoes, and added an extra
half-hour English-language encore, singing such show-stoppers as
``Trouble in River City'' and ``Bring Them Home,'' from ``Les
Miserables.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd loved it, and so did Patinkin, who has performed for
some half-full houses. ``I could just feel they needed a little
more,'' said Patinkin, who had previously performed the show in a
smaller space downtown. ``Downtown, we did enough for everybody,
but it seems up here everybody wants a slice of pizza to go with
the meal.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the fare may have been delicious, it wasn't easy to
make. And on Wednesday, after his matinee and a week's worth of
``impromptu'' encores, Patinkin announced that he was dumping the
idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It adds an extra three-and-a-half hours of singing a week,''
he said. ``That's exhausting.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Patinkin said he might revive the practice before his run
is over on Nov. 7. ``If I walk out with my gym shoes,'' he said,
``I'm doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   What an Ending
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Spalding Gray fell asleep during a performance. And he
couldn't be happier about it.
</P>
<P>
   Gray, you see, has been fine-tuning ``Morning, Noon and Night,''
a new monologue that, as the title suggests, takes places over the
course of a day in the life of the writer.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, during a run of the show on Long Island, Gray
found what he believes will be the ending of his piece: slumber.
</P>
<P>
   ``I closed my eyes, put my head down, the lights went out,'' he
said. ``I finished the arc.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason for Gray's fatigue is familiar to parents everywhere.
After 20 years of performing monologues on everything from the
Vietnam War to skiing, Gray has taken on fatherhood as a subject,
riffing on his experiences raising a toddler, a kindergartner and a
daughter bordering adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the funnier lines is at the end when I say, `Oh
my God, I'm totally wrecked and I haven't gone to work,' '' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he's resting now. For the next eight weeks, he will
perform the piece on Monday nights at Performance Space 122 in the
East Village. The show is billed as a work in progress, which for
Gray means recording each performance and later listening to the
audience reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The audience is teaching me what's funny,'' he said. ``They
make me self-conscious in a good way.''

<P>
   NEW CONCORD, Ohio _ At this spot, John Glenn was first airborne,
on a crazy, wooden bridge over the Baltimore &AMP; Ohio Railroad
tracks. It is a blind, one-lane bridge, so steeply arched that a
driver cannot see if a car is coming from the other direction. The
Lindbergh-obsessed young man known as Bud Glenn loved to drive fast
over the bridge in the 1930s, whistling as he drove.
</P>
<P>
   The old bridge is still here, as is most everything else in the
hometown of whistling John Herschel Glenn Jr. The oil fields and
strip mines are mostly gone from the surrounding hills of
southeastern Ohio, but the town of 2,200 has not changed much in
the 36 years since his last flight. A cup of coffee with breakfast
at Johnson's restaurant, across from his father's old plumbing
shop, is just 35 cents.
</P>
<P>
   But quietly something has changed, or has been lost, said
teen-agers and adults who exulted as they watched the Discovery
launching at John Glenn High School and his alma mater, Muskingum
College. They wondered whether New Concord, or any American town,
is still a good place to launch John Glenn's brand of heroism: a
mixture of Scotch-Irish Presbyterian decency, a daredevil's
courage, and Depression-era Midwestern gumption.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 1930s generation developed resourcefulness,'' said Dr.
Lorle Porter, a retired professor of history at Muskingum. ``John
Glenn tells a story with a catch in his throat _ and I've heard
that catch only a few times _ of hearing his parents in the next
room saying that they might lose the house that month. You work
harder the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   As Tom Wolfe wrote in ``The Right Stuff,'' sitting on top of an
enormous Roman candle requires courage. ``Heroism involves
self-sacrifice,'' Porter said just before the launching. ``The
selfish can't sacrifice. In a depression, if you don't sacrifice
for your family, you can't survive.''
</P>
<P>
   John Glenn's father, known as Herschel, was mostly deaf from
injuries in World War I. To help out at home, young Glenn sold
rhubarb all over town from the family garden. The Glenn family's
white-shingled bungalow sat next to the National Road, where an
earlier generation of pioneers passed in Conestoga wagons. Bud was
a lifeguard. And he washed autos, taking out a plucky classified
ad: ``Kars Kleaned Kwickly and Kompletely, 50 cents.''
</P>
<P>
   The history books record the young John Glenn as a praying
Presbyterian with his mother's Sunday school values, piously trying
to talk his fellow Mercury astronauts out of drinking and
carousing. People in New Concord knew him first as a freckle-faced,
red-haired hellion. His only surviving high school teacher, Ellis
Duitch, 95, tells of the time Bud let the skunk loose in the church
basement, so a girls' choir group would let out early.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's first love was flight. Growing up 132 miles east of the
Wright brothers' old bicycle shop in Dayton, he glued together
model airplanes. On Thursday he carried with him into space a piece
of fabric from a 1903 Wright plane.
</P>
<P>
   When the chance came for civilian flying lessons, Glenn and four
of his college buddies jumped at it. They drove two hours each way,
in a Ford woody station wagon over a bad road, to a tiny airfield
at New Philadelphia, Ohio. His flight instructor, Wally Spotts, now
83, loves to tease Glenn about his first orbital flight: ``I asked
him what was wrong that it took him three times around the field to
get that thing down.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's other love was Annie Castor, whom he met in a playpen.
He might have left New Concord earlier, but she was a year older
and had enrolled at Muskingum. In their youth, two of the college's
buildings stood half-finished, robbed of construction money when
the banks collapsed in 1929. John and Annie would have seen those
skeletons every time they walked to the lake on campus.
</P>
<P>
   New Concord celebrated the time when the ambitious Marine Corps
aviator shot down three MiGs in the last week of the Korean War,
and when he carried off his idea of a record-setting jet flight
from Los Angeles to New York. Church bells tolled when he lifted
off on Friendship 7, and the postflight parade brought 50,000
people to town.
</P>
<P>
   Before Thursday's launching, the town was a bit giddy, but also
on edge. The deadly Challenger was the only space shuttle launching
that most residents had seen. An all-night prayer vigil was
well-attended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a disaster plan on my desk if it doesn't make it,''
said Gary Lucas, principal of the high school. He was ready to
bring in counselors for the high school students, who were
preschoolers when Christa McAuliffe, a teacher, and six others died
in the Challenger disaster, in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The students marveled at Glenn's grit. With times easier today,
and families more distended, the students said it might be harder
for a young John Glenn to make it into space.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was brought up to believe that you can do anything you put
your mind to,'' said Elizabeth Hirschfeld of Bellevue, Ohio, a
Muskingum freshman. ``Not as many people are brought up that way
today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And not as many parents are as involved with their children as
before,'' added another freshman, Megan Carr, from Norwalk, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Grit will be the theme of a planned John Glenn Museum. Its home
in perhaps five years could be the Glenn family bungalow, which
would be moved again to Main Street. Not only space trinkets and
political memorabilia would be on display, but also reminders of
striving in the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may seem silly, but I'd like to see a boy's bedroom full
of model airplanes,'' said Porter. ``We'll sell rhubarb jam.''
</P>
<P>
   Just around the corner is the old wooden bridge, with a posted
limit of 5 mph. It is tempting to go at least 8. And to whistle.

   KFAR DAROM, Gaza Strip _ A jeep carrying Israeli soldiers
intercepted a Palestinian suicide bomber as he was about to ram a
car packed with explosives into a school bus carrying children from
this Jewish settlement Thursday. The jeep absorbed the explosion,
which killed one soldier and wounded three others; the bomber also
died.
</P>
<P>
   In the politically charged aftermath of the peace accord signing
last week, the attack was seen as the first real test of both
Israeli and Palestinian resolve to abide by the agreement, which
exchanges land in the West Bank for promises of a Palestinian
crackdown on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat issued a quick and unusually
fierce condemnation of the attack and then placed under house
arrest Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual leader of the Islamic
fundamentalist group Hamas. In Gaza City, Palestinian officers also
began rounding up other leaders of Hamas, which is believed to have
been responsible for the attack, and by midnight they had arrested
more than 100 people.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faced
heightened pressure to scuttle the deal from its right-wing
opponents, but gave no public indication that the attack would
alter his commitment. Israeli television, however, reported that
Netanyahu, in a private conversation with Arafat, warned the
Palestinian leader that continued terrorist acts would jeopardize
the accord, which is to take effect Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu has delayed presenting the peace agreement to his
Cabinet for ratification, awaiting a security work plan from the
Palestinians. Thursday, a senior Palestinian official, Hassan
Asfour, said the Palestinians would submit the blueprint to the
United States on Monday, but he asserted that ``it is impossible to
put a complete end to such operations.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Palestinian-controlled Gaza Strip, Jewish settlers live
defiantly amid the sand dunes in isolated compounds. Their red
brick sidewalks, green lawns and rainbow-hued playgrounds resemble
Phoenix condominium complexes, but for the anti-tank walls that
surround them and the donkeys that amble outside the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Since the withdrawal of Israeli troops from most of Gaza several
years ago, the settlement children travel to and from school in
armored convoys, with Israeli army jeeps leading and following
their bulletproof buses.
</P>
<P>
   As 40 elementary school children journeyed to class Thursday
morning, an Opel approached them from a dirt road in the bush
surrounding a Palestinian refugee camp. The car, entering the
opposite lane, headed directly for the school bus. The lead escort
jeep moved to block the bus, colliding with the Opel and bearing
the major impact of the explosion.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I was on a typical trip, behind the jeep, and then, a boom,
fire, smoke and flames,'' said Yehuda Shaltriel, the bus driver.
``First thing I did was to stop the bus because the jeep had
overturned. I opened the front door to let the smoke out. The kids
were shouting, crying, `Mommy! Daddy!' Sure, they were shook up.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the gates of the Kfar Darom settlement, windows rattled
with the force of the explosion, and parents who had just placed
their children on the bus later said they knew precisely what had
happened. One frantic father ran almost a mile to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here are very shocked,'' said Shella Shorshan, whose
two children had missed the bus because she overslept. ``If the
attack had been successful, our lives would have been shattered. It
was a miracle what happened to our kids, although clearly we have
mixed feelings because a soldier had to give his life.''
</P>
<P>
   The soldier, Sgt. Alexei Nikov, was a 19-year-old immigrant from
the former Soviet Union who was riding in the rear of the jeep. He
came to Israel two years ago on his own as part of a program that
inducts immigrants directly into the army. His family followed last
year, and lives in Haifa. His funeral is scheduled for Friday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One of the three wounded soldiers was listed in serious
condition at Soroka Hospital in Beersheba on Thursday night, and
another was recovering from leg fractures in the orthopedic ward
there. The third had been released.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli security officials have traced the Opel, which was
packed with an estimated 150 pounds of explosives, to a Palestinian
who lives in the Han Yunis refugee camp. They said the mastermind
of the attack was Mohammed Dief, a Hamas terrorist who tops the
Israelis' list of wanted fugitives.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the explosion, Israeli and Palestinian
troops worked side by side in the dunes of the southern Gaza Strip,
evacuating the schoolchildren, rushing the soldiers to hospitals
and collecting evidence from the sand-swept road. Top Israeli and
Palestinian military officials visited the grisly scene _ a
charred, mangled wreck of a car, an overturned, blackened shell of
a jeep and the remains of the bomber, which were scattered and
covered by blankets.
</P>
<P>
   It is an area that is under joint security control, and it was a
picture of collaboration under the palm trees. There was even
hugging between Israeli and Palestinian officers. Maj. Gen. Yom Tov
Samia, an Israeli, pronounced the cooperating forces to be ``in a
good mood working together,'' and Gen. Abdelrazak Mujaida, a
Palestinian, echoed the sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   In a counterpoint to the cooperation, other Israeli and
Palestinian forces not far away engaged in a shootout that stemmed
from the Israeli hunt for accomplices of the bomber. One of the
Palestinian suspects was shot and wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli army chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz,
attributed the suicide bombing to Hamas, and the Israeli radio
reported that Hamas had claimed responsibility in an anonymous
call.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my assessment that the Hamas is making an effort to
carry out terror attacks in the stage between the signing of the
agreement and its implementation,'' Mofaz said. ``Today we stopped
a harsh disaster and paid a price. I hope that, in the future, the
Palestinian Authority will do what it's responsible for under the
agreement, so that such attacks don't come out of its territory.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on the Israeli radio, Yassin denied knowledge of
the attack but also asserted defensively: ``Today's action was
aimed at soldiers, not kids. How do we know the aim was to hurt
kids?''
</P>
<P>
   When Yassin, who uses a wheelchair and wears a long white robe,
was put under house arrest, Palestinian officials said it was for
``speaking out against Palestinian national interests.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday night the officials also cut Yassin's telephone
lines after he gave an interview critical of the Palestinian
Authority to an Arabic satellite television program based in Qatar,
his son said.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli intelligence experts predicted that Palestinians would
take to the streets in Gaza to protest the arrest of the sheik, who
has been a nettlesome voice of opposition to Arafat since his
release from an Israeli prison in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arafat has a clear interest to demonstrate toward Hamas
determination in his war against terror, and he can't give them a
stronger signal than to place Ahmed Yassin under house arrest,''
said Carmi Gilon, former head of the Israeli General Security
Services. ``But Palestinian public opinion will not let this go by
in silence.''
</P>
<P>
   After the explosion, the children continued on to school in
their bus. The settlers sent psychologists to draw them out of
their shock. Later, one 10-year-old girl complained to her mother
that the psychologists were trying too hard to reassure them that
everything was fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is not fine,'' she said tearfully. ``Mom, we saw
the bus, how it burned. Gabi, his whole face was covered with
blood.'' Gabi was the first name of one of their security escorts.
</P>
<P>
   When the stretch bus returned to the compound after school,
parents ran to greet their children, who tumbled off the bus into
their arms. One man led the children in song and dance, celebrating
``the miracle.'' Many mothers pressed their children to their
hearts and cried.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got our kids back as a gift,'' said Yamima Ayubi, mother of
five.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1970s, the Labor Party placed Jewish settlements in
Gaza as a strategic measure, to guard against invasion from Sinai.
After the peace treaty with Egypt, the strategic importance of the
settlements was considered by many to have vanished, and some
Israelis favored evacuating the settlers as part of the peace
accord with the Palestinians. Netanyahu's policy, however, has been
to reinforce the settlements' existence.
</P>
<P>
   Relieved but infuriated Thursday, the Kfar Darom settlers, 45
families who operate a produce-packing plant, said they would react
by digging in deeper, literally. One woman pointed to water pipes
and said that they would soon be installed, and that new houses
would be built, despite the growing threat from their Palestinian
neighbors and what they perceive to be the Israeli Army's
unwillingness to protect them aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, there's going to be a war,'' said Yigal
Kirshenzaft, chairman of the Gaza settlers' association. ``It's
just a matter of time.''

FAMILIES OF CHILEAN VICTIMS DESPAIR AS BRITAIN RULES THAT PINOCHET
MAY LEAVE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD KRAUSS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ Thirteen days ago they thrilled to the news
that Gen. Augusto Pinochet had been arrested in London on a Spanish
warrant accusing him of committing genocide during his 17-year rule
of Chile.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday they reverted to despair on hearing that the
British High Court had ruled that Pinochet had diplomatic immunity
and that he could be released to return to Chile unpunished.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone could just manage to make Pinochet confess, maybe I
could find my brother's resting place,'' said Miriam Tamayo, 43, as
a single tear rolled down her cheek. ``I just want to put a flower
by his grave.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tamayo's brother was one of 94 Chileans named in the Spanish
warrant who disappeared from neighboring countries, where they had
fled after Pinochet seized power. Even now, Ms. Tamayo and other
relatives of the disappeared meet every Tuesday afternoon, sharing
their pictures, the scraps of information they have meticulously
assembled, and their rage.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Humberto Campos, 48, was stripped of his command as a
captain in the Chilean army after the disappearance of his brother
Jose in 1981. ``I will feel content only when Pinochet finally
faces justice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Their hopes were raised when Pinochet, 82, who ruled Chile as a
dictator from 1973 to 1990, was arrested on a warrant issued by
Judge Baltasar Garzon Real, the Spanish judge who has accused him
of coordinating a plan to find and eliminate scores of Chilean,
Argentine and Spanish citizens who had fled from Chile to
neighboring countries after the 1973 military coup. Garzon's
investigation is the most thorough look so far at that plan, called
Operation Condor, one of the most closely held secrets of the
Pinochet regime.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Condor has already been disclosed by a Chilean
commission that in 1991 documented the disappearances of more than
3,000 Chileans but did not name the officers responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Garzon is focusing on a relatively small number of victims
listed in the Chilean commission's report _ those who lost their
lives in what he describes as a shadowy international criminal
conspiracy in which the security forces of Argentina, Bolivia and
perhaps Paraguay also took part.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mystery that breaks the heart,'' said Ana Maria
Saguate, who has wondered why anyone would have gone to so much
trouble to hunt down her father in Buenos Aires. ``We don't know
what he was charged with. He deserved a lawyer, a judge and his
family to help him just like Pinochet does in London.''
</P>
<P>
   The Case of Jorge Saguate Herrera
</P>
<P>
   The case of Jorge Saguate Herrera is perhaps the most mystifying
of those included in Garzon's warrant. At 51, he had recently
retired as a bookkeeper in the Chilean Air Force's traffic control
office and was living in Argentina, when he was shoved into the
trunk of an unmarked car by Argentine security agents and never
seen again.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Saguate was targeted because he never tried to hide his
disgust with the Pinochet coup as he continued to work a couple of
years for the air force. Maybe he was targeted because he had
hidden two leftist Spanish nuns in his house from the police before
he finally retired and left Chile with his family in May 1975. Or
maybe it was because, as a refugee in Buenos Aires, he lent money
and gave other help to Chilean exiles.
</P>
<P>
   As Saguate's widow, Hilda, 73, told the story, Saguate was
house-sitting for a Chilean friend, Jose Luis Nell, who was living
in Buenos Aires but had taken a trip to Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
   Nell was arrested in Paraguay. A few days later, Argentine
security forces raided his house in Buenos Aires, where they found
Saguate. They also found a list of Chilean political prisoners in
one of Saguate's jackets. The police then seized him, and he was
never heard from again.
</P>
<P>
   What little his family does know comes from a witness of the
raid who fled the house and told the Saguates what he had seen. No
one knows why the Argentine security forces would have let the
witness go, and Saguate's family believes he may have worked for
Chilean intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as her husband disappeared and the family left Argentina
for Norway, their Chilean lawyer used his power of attorney to sell
their house in Santiago and pocketed the money. With jobs hard to
come by in Chile, especially for former political exiles, three of
Hilda's five children have remained in Norway.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than 20 years,'' Hilda said, crying, ``that's a long time
to live with this. For all I know, my husband is still alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few days, Hilda and two of her daughters have been
waiting to see what will happen to Pinochet in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really painful for us,'' said Patricia Saguate, 40,
when the family heard that the British court agreed with the
Chilean government that General Pinochet had diplomatic immunity.
``It means that future dictators who commit genocides that will
kill many more like our father will go unpunished.''

<P>
   The Case of Luis Enrique Elgueta Diaz
</P>
<P>
   Laura Elgueta Diaz, 40, was taken completely by surprise.
Sitting at her desk in a press office of the Chilean foreign
ministry and scanning news about the Pinochet case on the Internet
the other day, she read that Garzon's warrant included the case of
her brother Luis Enrique Elgueta Diaz.
</P>
<P>
   She immediately called her mother, Ruth, a 69-year-old
nutritionist, and they shared tears of joy.
</P>
<P>
   Luis was a guitarist who sang in a folk band that accompanied
President Salvador Allende Gossens when he toured the country
before the coup that toppled the Socialist government in 1973. His
family described him as a gentle idealist, who immediately took
responsibility for getting a woman pregnant by marrying her.
</P>
<P>
   Luis fled the country after the coup, but returned in June 1975
thinking that the military would soon return to the barracks. He
took up music studies at the University of Chile while working
clandestinely for the Movement of the Revolutionary Left, or MIR, a
Marxist group that espoused the tactics of Che Guevara.
</P>
<P>
   Luis' family members say they still wonder what he did for the
MIR and whether he ever broke the law _ questions they hope might
be answered if Pinochet is ever tried. They said he was expelled
from the university for his activism. And after several of his MIR
comrades disappeared, he decided to leave for Argentina. But before
he left, they said, Luis gave a friend named Sergio the phone
number where he could be found in Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Sergio was picked up by the Chilean secret police,
according to Garzon's warrant. Four weeks after that, Luis
disappeared from his apartment in Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Luis' family, who also lived for a time in Argentina
in exile, have investigated the case and added many details to
Garzon's warrant. They said that witnesses living in Luis' building
reported that a group of 15 to 20 men, some in Argentine military
uniforms, broke into Luis' apartment at 2 a.m. on July 27, 1976.
Luis was seen resisting the Argentine soldiers, kicking and
screaming as they tossed him and a friend into a blue Ford Falcon.
The Garzon summons said Luis was handed over to the Chilean secret
police in Buenos Aires, and never seen again.
</P>
<P>
   For the next two years, Luis' mother said, she knocked on the
doors of Argentine police and military offices in a vain attempt to
find answers. But the family eventually moved to Mexico after Laura
was picked up for several hours by Argentine security agents,
nearly raped, and warned by a man she said had a strong Chilean
accent to give up her search for her brother.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth said she went on believing that her son was still alive for
10 years, until some friends in Mexico took her to see a fortune
teller. ``He told me `You have a problem, a family member who
disappeared _ I don't see him now because he is below a lot of
water,''' she recalled, nearly losing her composure in a flush of
tears. ``I then figured, considering how tortured people suffer, it
was better that he be dead.''
</P>
<P>
   But now the family must endure another crisis. When Laura heard
about the British court decision yesterday, she said, ``I called my
parents and they were crying. I was so disgusted I left work and
went home depressed. Perhaps we expected too much.''
</P>
<P>
   The Case of Luis Gonzalo Munoz Velasquez
</P>
<P>
   Time feels frozen in the little house where Edith Munoz
Velasquez, a 54-year-old kindergarten teacher, lives on the
outskirts of Santiago. A photograph of Allende, the Socialist
president overthrown by Pinochet in 1973, hangs on the wall among
memorabilia of the Socialist struggle. And then, of course, hang
pictures of her younger brother, Luis, along with two other men who
disappeared with him 22 years ago in the Argentine city of Mendoza.
</P>
<P>
   Trained as an accountant, Luis was an avid soccer player. He had
been a prominent leader of the Chilean Socialist Party's youth
organization, and was beginning to campaign as a candidate for the
City Council of the town of San Bernardo.
</P>
<P>
   Luis remained in Chile after the coup, collecting food to take
to jails holding political prisoners. After several family members,
all Socialist Party activists, were arrested for questioning, he
left Argentina in September 1975 for Mendoza. There he did various
jobs, but concentrated his efforts on helping resettle Chilean
political refugees, according to family members.
</P>
<P>
   As Edith told the story, Luis and his two Chilean friends in
Mendoza felt threatened by early 1976 after they noticed they were
being followed by men they did not know. On April 2, they visited
the office of a local human rights group asking for shelter. They
were told to go back the next day. When they did, the three were
kidnapped only a block away from the human rights office, leading
Edith to believe someone in the organization had tipped off Chilean
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   The Garzon warrant said that they were picked up by ``joint
forces of the Argentine Federal Police and Chilean secret police
agents,'' then taken overland across the Chilean border a few weeks
later. Edith says her brother Alex happened to be standing a block
away from Luis when he was picked up, witnessed the kidnapping, and
told her Argentine sailors took part in the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Luis' parents, Maria and Federico, a retired military officer,
spent the last years of their lives in exile in Winnipeg, Canada,
dedicated to finding their missing son. Federico flew back to Chile
with a local Canadian politician to seek answers. Maria went to the
Winnipeg airport repeatedly, a picture of Luis in hand, to ask
incoming Chilean refugees and tourists if they had seen him. And
she always said that when she died she would haunt Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   Maria would put her grandchildren on her lap to tell them
stories about their uncle, and how they should dedicate their lives
to his ideals. Today, several belong to the Socialist Party youth
organization and joined in demonstrations against Pinochet when he
entered the Senate as an unelected member seven months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Edith and her brother Hernan said they know Luis must be dead,
but they want to find his remains and give him a proper burial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before they died, our parents said that one day they wanted to
lie in peace next to Luis,'' Edith said. ``I never lose hope that
Pinochet will someday face justice. God sometimes takes his time.''

U.S. WINS SUPPORT IN CHOICE OF OIL-PIPELINE ROUTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Leaders of countries around the Caspian Sea
declared Thursday that they want to export their new-found oil
along a pipeline route favored by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Competition for the pipeline is reaching a peak as oil companies
prepare to announce which route they favor. They may make their
choice as early as next month.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Russia and Iran have each proposed routes
that would favor their political and economic interests. The choice
could have long-term strategic implications in the Caspian region
and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's declaration, regional leaders ``strongly confirmed
their determination'' to see the pipeline built on the U.S.-backed
route.
</P>
<P>
   President Heydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan said he and his
counterparts had signed ``a declaration of historic importance.''
He predicted that the pipeline would be ``the most shining peace
project of the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   But because oil companies and not governments will pay for
whichever pipeline is built, the declaration was largely symbolic.
It increased political pressure on oil executives but did nothing
visible to lessen the costs of what they consider an excessively
expensive option.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Aliyev at Thursday's signing were the presidents of
Georgia, Turkey, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. There was one surprise
absentee, President Saparmurad Niyazov of Turkmenistan, who has at
times proved a prickly partner for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson flew to Ankara, Turkey's
capital, on Thursday to witness signing of the declaration and drum
up last-minute support for the U.S.-backed route.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson was the latest in a stream of Clinton administration
officials who have passed through the region in recent days. They
are pressing for a route that would run from Baku, the Azerbaijani
capital, to the Turkish port of Ceyhan on the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hard work remains to be done to build this pipeline, and today
the presidents committed to doing it,'' Richardson said. ``From
today, we are no longer talking about whether we will have a
pipeline from Baku to Ceyhan. We are talking about how.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson won a modest breakthrough Thursday on an issue that
had threatened to spread discord in the region. He emerged with an
agreement by Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan to submit their sensitive
border dispute to his mediation. The two countries disagree over
ownership of potentially rich tracts under the Caspian.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said that under the plan agreed to Thursday, which was
not publicly announced, Richardson would seek to offer a solution
to the border dispute within four months. Neither side would be
required to accept his solution, but there would be considerable
pressure for both to do so.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials are urging Turkey to offer the oil companies
inducements to build along the Baku-Ceyhan route. They say Turkey
has begun to do so.

THE WORLD QUAKES ONCE AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ The deep, primeval rumble that shook
the Kennedy Space Center and propelled John H. Glenn Jr. into space
again also shook the world.
</P>
<P>
   On the power of seven million pounds of thrust and countless
millions of prayers, Glenn returned to the fathomless and seemingly
changeless expanse of space. But one of the reasons so many were
watching with so much captivation is that the earth he is orbiting
again has changed so utterly in the 36 years since he last slipped
gravity's jealous grasp.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists and astronomers _ philosophers whose tools are the
telescope and the computer _ tell us that when we look into space
we look back in time. So it was Thursday. Even if the NASA
technicians and the aerospace engineers and the payload specialists
describe Glenn's journey as a miracle of space travel, its
significance is as a marvel of time travel.
</P>
<P>
   The week that preceded the launch was something of an American
retrospective, a national film festival of the New Frontier, a
poignant reminder of how far we have come from the frightening
chill of the Cold War and the brave pioneers of Project Mercury _
and of how far we have strayed from the innocent idealism of the
John Kennedy years.
</P>
<P>
   When President Kennedy launched the nation on its trajectory to
the moon, he knew intuitively that the passengers would not be
individual astronauts, but ``an entire nation.'' That nation
watched Thursday because Glenn is the oldest space traveler ever
and space travel is humankind's oldest dream. But that was only
part of it.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that the second voyage of John Glenn was more a
voyage of discovery than the first.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the reflection of the steely efficiency of the space
shuttle Discovery, with its reusable, detachable lightweight
boosters, its five onboard computers, its 7,800 sensors, its 2,312
cockpit display components and its interior compartment roomy
enough to permit the crew a free range of movement, do we fully see
how primitive was Friendship 7, the capsule that Glenn rode into
space in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the casual comportment of the seven crew members, more
techies than test pilots and all smiles and waves in their orange
jumpsuits, do we fully understand the courage of the original seven
astronauts, those avatars of duct tape and duty who bet their lives
and the nation's honor on a spacecraft that, from today's
perspective, has all the technological sophistication of the vacuum
tubes that used to be inside televisions and all the retro feel of
another technological marvel with the engine in the rear, the old
Volkswagen bug.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the fuzzy film clips of the Mercury era, with the
astronauts soaring into the heavens on Redstone and Atlas boosters
to the soundtrack of crises in Berlin and Cuba, desegregation
battles in Louisiana and Mississippi, tension in the Indian
subcontinent, and superpower nuclear testing on Christmas Island
and in the Arctic do we fully understand the risks of the early
1960s and the fragile tissue that somehow separated world peace
from world war.
</P>
<P>
   Only at the elbow of a new century, when space travel may become
routine and not a novelist's reverie, do we fully appreciate how
1962 was a turning point, bringing a symbolic end to World War II
(with the hanging of Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem)
and bringing a symbolic beginning to a freer America (with the
dispatch of federal troops to permit James Meredith to attend the
University of Mississippi), a more frightening world (with the
missile crisis in Cuba), a more unruly society (with the founding
of the Students for a Democratic Society) and a more broadly based
popular culture (with the debut of Johnny Carson on ``The Tonight
Show'').
</P>
<P>
   Amid all of that came the first orbital mission of John Glenn.
It made America proud, it made space flight seem possible, it made
Glenn a hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a hero to all of us,'' said former Senator Jake Garn, a
Utah Republican who joined the Senate along with Glenn in 1975 and
then flew 109 orbits in space in April 1995. ``He had watched
rocket after rocket _ the crudest technology _ blow up. And then he
dared to fly himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Charles Lindbergh, Glenn still managed to fly, alone, above
the world with a breezy innocence, achieving the unforgettable and
then living to see it rendered routine. Like Lindbergh, linked
forever to the Spirit of St. Louis and Le Bourget airport, Glenn is
linked forever to Friendship 7 and Cape Canaveral.
</P>
<P>
   The voyage of Discovery will change none of that.
</P>
<P>
   The generation that grew up with John Glenn may go through
history forever in blue jeans, but Glenn will sail through history
forever in the silver of Project Mercury.
</P>
<P>
   This flight _ a ``High Flight,'' as the Canadian pilot and poet
John Gillespie Magee Jr. might put it _ is a reprise, the first
flight was an adventure. This flight is a joyride of national
nostalgia, the first flight was a mission of national security.
This time Glenn is a passenger, the first time he was a pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   And yet we watched. We felt the almost unbearable tension as the
countdown stopped, started, stopped and started again. We heard the
eerie silence as the giant spacecraft lifted from its pad. We
watched the fire of the boosters, almost blinding to the eye, as
the full force of the rockets kicked in. We watched the smoke
linger in the air, hanging above the Atlantic like streamers.
</P>
<P>
   We watched with a mix of pride, fascination and fear that
seemed, to those old enough to recall it, much the same as what we
felt on Feb. 20, 1962.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know what captivated so many,'' Mercury
astronaut Scott Carpenter said of the early days of space flight in
a brief conversation in a Cape Canaveral parking lot the other
afternoon. ``But whatever it was, it seemed to work.''
</P>
<P>
   President Kennedy said that Americans would go to space and to
the moon because that task would ``organize and measure the best of
our skills.'' John Glenn of New Concord, Ohio, went into space
again Thursday afternoon, and the entire nation watched,
prayerfully, breathlessly, because deep in our subconscious we
still want to believe that the very idea of a mission itself _ the
journey as much as the return _ organizes and measures the best of
ourselves.

BBN-OMALLEY (Los Angeles) _ Former Dodgers president Peter O'Malley
announces that he will leave the organization at the end of the

FBC-USC (Los Angeles) _ It's been the Trojans' Achilles' heel the
last few seasons and it will be the area under attack in Saturday's
game against Washington. USC's offensive line has not lived up to
the tradition established by such players as Ron Yary, Anthony

CANDIDATES FIND VIRTUE IN POLITICAL MATURITY

   WASHINGTON _ Paul Ryan is proud of the years he spent on Capitol
Hill as a congressional aide, but he believes the time has come to
hold the front-office job himself. At 28, the Republican from
Janesville, Wis., is running for an open House seat.
</P>
<P>
   His opponent in this swing district is Democrat Lydia
Spottswood, a 47-year-old former nurse, a wife, and a mother who is
trying to make Ryan's youth an issue by citing ``life experiences''
she says make her the better candidate to understand people's
concerns about education and health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our opponent would like this contest to come down to a
referendum on age,'' said John Murray, Ryan's campaign manager.
``Paul says that you don't have to be old to have valuable
experience and be eminently qualified.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan isn't alone. In California's Silicon Valley, Charles Ball,
a fresh-faced Republican, was branded ``young and inexperienced''
in a recent debate by Representative Ellen Tauscher, 47, the
first-term Democrat Ball is trying to unseat. Ball, a military
analyst at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratories, may be
inexperienced politically, but young? He's 36.
</P>
<P>
   At one time baby boomers thought it was a vice to trust anyone
over 30. Now, in what may be one of the truly unexpected legacies
of President Clinton's affair with Monica S. Lewinsky, candidates
are finding a new virtue in political maturity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely a year that favors older candidates,'' said
Mark Campbell, a Republican consultant. ``Clinton has given MTV
candidates a bad name. Voters are looking for candidates who are
smarter, and behave better, than they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Rothenberg, a political analyst who tracks congressional
races, said that even though Ryan in Wisconsin is ``obsessed with
politics,'' the fact that he ``looks like the junior high school
president'' may not help.
</P>
<P>
   Young politicians haven't always had such trouble on the
campaign trail. The big freshman classes in 1994 and 1996 included
quite a few young, successful congressional candidates, including
20-something Democrats Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island and Harold
Ford Jr. of Tennessee. And the 1994 Republican Revolution had
plenty of fresh recruits, Jon Christensen of Nebraska and Joe
Scarborough of Florida, both 31, among them.
</P>
<P>
   This year, candidates under 35 face obstacles beyond the Clinton
factor. An unusually small number of retirements from Congress
means there are few open seats where an energetic but underfinanced
newcomer might have a chance. And it is no secret that both
political parties try to steer novices into local contests and away
from national races where they might sap the strength and war
chests of more promising, experienced candidates.
</P>
<P>
   It's a different story, of course, if a young candidate has the
appeal of a famous name or the deep pockets of a family fortune.
The brightest young stars in House races this season also are
political offspring.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Casey, 32, son of former Pennsylvania Governor Bob
Casey, is running as a Democrat in Scranton; Marjorie McKeithen,
32, granddaughter of a former Louisiana governor and daughter of
the current secretary of state, is challenging a Republican
incumbent in Baton Rouge. Molly Bordonaro, 30, who comes from a
prominent Oregon political family, is seeking an open seat in
Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless young people have seen it up close and personal, it may
take them a while to figure out that politics is the way they want
to spend their lives,'' said Olivia Morgan, a spokeswoman for the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. ``It's not like it's
something you go to graduate school to study.''
</P>
<P>
   Young people like Ryan, who chart a course from legislative aide
to chief of a Senate staff to congressman, are the exceptions in
Generation X. According to ``The Fourth Turning,'' a book by Neil
Howe and William Strauss that explores generational change, the
most recently enfranchised Americans _ those born between 1961 and
1980 _ ``politically lean toward pragmatism and nonaffiliation and
would rather volunteer than vote.''
</P>
<P>
   That is borne out by a University of California at Los Angeles
study of recent freshmen that shows only about 6 percent even
contemplate a government career. The number was three times higher
30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Gans, director of the Committee for the Study of the
American Electorate, a nonprofit group, said that is not
surprising, given that today's young people have been raised in
homes where the majority of parents don't vote. In addition, the
attitude of young voters toward government has been shaped by a
generation of politicians who rail against Washington, and every
signal in the culture tells them to get what's theirs, not save the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Gans estimates that 35 to 40 percent of all voters will turn out
Tuesday on Election Day, but fewer than 15 percent of voters ages
18 to 24 will cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last few months have packed in every reason young
Americans have to despise politics, the yelling, the name-calling,
the mudslinging, and dishonest commercials,'' said Michele
Mitchell, the 28-year-old author of ``A New Kind of Party Animal,''
a book about politics and the youth culture. ``They will shrug off
the midterm elections with a `whatever,' or vote for a protest
candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Corey Post is 28 and the publisher of Generation Next, a monthly
newspaper aimed at people 18 to 30 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aura of Camelot around the White House is certainly gone,
and it took with it any emotional high young people get from
supporting a candidate,'' Post said.
</P>
<P>
   While both political parties are making huge efforts to get
voters to the polls next week, they acknowledge that few resources
are aimed at the young. Even Rock the Vote, the hip, MTV-sponsored
group that registered 500,000 young people in 1996, has moved on to
community activism.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Alfano, 31, is the oldest partner in a political consulting
firm that specializes in giving GOP baby-boomer candidates advice
on how to use the Internet, music, and video to connect to younger
voters. She says it is ``a shame'' that the president's behavior
has been such a turnoff to young candidates and voters alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people were just starting to like politics and really
wanted to believe in a hip candidate like Bill Clinton,'' Alfano
said. ``The damage he did was to slap back this whole generational
tide, and that makes me angry.''

FOUR MEDIA SHARES SOAR ON GOOD NEWS

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Stock of post-production specialist Four Media
Co., which recently hit an all-time low, jumped 60 percent Thursday
following a better-than-expected earnings report.
</P>
<P>
   Shares gained $2.25 to $6 after the company reported profits of
$1.15 million, or 10 cents a share, for the fourth quarter ended
Aug. 2, more than double earnings of $427,000 in the 1997 period.
Revenues surged 50 percent to $34.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   That beat Wall Street's average estimate of 8 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Volume hit 1.42 million shares, 37 times the average volume
during the past six months, and the stock's heaviest trading day
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Until Thursday's rebound, the stock's share price had lost more
than half its value since the market crested in mid-July. ``I've
always maintained that this is a company that should be trading in
the low teens,'' said analyst Stewart Halpern of ING Barings Furman
Selz. ``I think it's been hurt because the investment community has
had a nasty experience with other post-production stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Burbank, Calif.-based Four Media went public at $10 in February
1997 with the goal of becoming Hollywood's leader in one-stop
production services such as editing, mixing, language translation
and conversion to overseas technical standards. It has been
aggressively buying rivals such as film-editing specialist MSCL for
$68 million, Pacific Ocean Post for $27 million and Video Symphony
for $5.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Halpern said Four Media's management has demonstrated a
consistent ability to increase profits while digesting acquisitions
in an industry where the demand for its services should continue to
grow. ``Its fundamentals and execution are very solid,'' he said.

BUSH PREDICTS LANDSLIDE VICTORY IN TEXAS 

</HEADLINE>

and ARMANDO VILLAFRANCA 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL PASO, Texas _ Hoping to win a statewide landslide re-election
victory next Tuesday, Gov. George W. Bush predicted Thursday he
will become the first Republican gubernatorial candidate to carry
predominantly Democratic El Paso County.
</P>
<P>
   At least one local poll in the county gave weight to Bush's
prediction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm not supposed to make predictions, but I'm beginning
to feel something going on in El Paso County,'' Bush told a crowd
of about 600 Hispanic and Anglo supporters at his campaign
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a feeling when they flash up on the TV screen, it's
going to say George W. Bush won this county.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 11 Republican statewide candidates have won El Paso County
in the past 20 years, and almost every one of them went on to
landslide victories statewide. Such a victory for Bush would
strengthen his position for a potential presidential race in 2000
by showing he can bring in independent and Hispanic votes.
</P>
<P>
   In elections during this decade, El Paso has been won by
Democratic Gov. Ann Richards for re-election in 1994 and Bill
Clinton for president in 1992 and 1996 even though they lost the
state to their Republican opponents. U.S. Sens. Phil Gramm and Kay
Bailey Hutchison, both Republicans, carried the county in lopsided
races.
</P>
<P>
   A poll conducted for The El Paso Times that will be published
Sunday is expected to show Bush well positioned to win the county,
but the newspaper declined to release the poll results.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not true,'' Mauro said while campaigning in East
Texas. ``I'm going to win El Paso and I don't comment on rumors.''
He cited polls showing the governor's race in El Paso County
tightening over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush's numbers have been dropping and will continue their
downward slide,'' Mauro said.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro campaigned in Texarkana, Longview, Tyler, Nacogdoches,
Lufkin, Port Arthur and Beaumont on Thursday, concentrating on East
Texas after stumping in West and South Texas earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   A poll by the El Paso Times last year showed Bush leading Mauro
70 percent to 17 percent, and the lead had declined to 50 percent
to 35 percent by this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro was hoping to benefit from two controversial issues in the
El Paso area: the planned placement of a nuclear waste dump in
Sierra Blanca and the Tigua Indians' battle with Bush to keep open
their Speaking Rock casino.
</P>
<P>
   But the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission decided
last week not to place the dump in Sierra Blanca _ giving Bush the
chance Thursday to declare the dump ``muerto'' _ and the casino
issue will be decided in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Bush's strength in El Paso comes from his project to win
40 percent of the Hispanic vote in Texas. Bush got 24 percent in
1994, and GOP attorney general candidate Roy Barrera Jr. received
the most Hispanic votes by a Republican in Texas in 1986 when he
got 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the Hispanic vote ``es muy importante para mi (is very
important for me).''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he has tried to earn the support of Hispanic voters on
issues such as education, where he has pushed a program he calls
English-plus. The program recognizes that some bilingual education
programs work, but that children need to learn English.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hispanic population shares many of the conservative values
that I share. And it's important that I put a compassionate face on
those values so they can say, `Hey, here's a person who
understands,' '' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody loves to label everybody in politics, so I'm going
to label myself: I'm a compassionate conservative,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush received about 15 percent of the black vote in 1994, but he
declined to predict whether he will improve that percentage this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough vote for a fellow like me to win,'' Bush said.
``The Republican label.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauro toured traditionally Democratic East Texas and criticized
Bush for being inconsistent in his handling of death penalty cases.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro complained that Bush sought clemency for convicted serial
killer Henry Lee Lucas out of political convenience while saying he
did not want to interfere with the Board of Pardons and Paroles in
the case of Karla Faye Tucker, who was executed this year for a
drug-crazed ax murder despite pleas for clemency from death-penalty
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush should not have gone on the front page of every
newspaper in the state and suggested to his pardons and parole
board that they look for clemency for Henry Lee Lucas; and when the
pardons and parole board recommended clemency, he should have said
no,`` Mauro said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush this year commuted Lucas' death sentence of life in prison
after the Board of Pardons and Parole recommended clemency. Lucas
had recanted hundreds of murder confessions, including the one for
which he was sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too often we have said we're going to support juries'
decisions in Texas, why change for a serial criminal?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush responded: ``I would worry if I were a Texan about somebody
who plays politics with the death penalty,'' without specifically
accusing Mauro of doing that.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro also said he would have granted clemency for Irineo
Montoya-Tristan, a Mexican national convicted for the 1986 murder
of a Port Isabel man. Mexico protested that Texas had denied
Montoya's right to contact his consulate under a U.S. treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Montoya's execution in 1997 generated public outcry in Mexico
because many believed Montoya, who did not speak English, signed a
confession that was written for him in English.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mauro's position in the Lucas and Montoya cases
contradicted each other, the land commissioner said Montoya's case
was different because it involved international law and threatened
to erode relations between Texas and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about it and it's something I believe in. I think
the future of Texas is tied to having a great relationship with
Mexico,'' Mauro said. ``It's something I feel strongly about.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ignored our treaty with Mexico, executed a Mexican national
and let off Henry Lee Lucas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he upheld the laws of Texas in the Montoya case after
Montoya had been tried, convicted and had his state and federal
appeals run out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no treaty that says Texas cannot exercise the death
penalty for anybody in our state so long as they've been given
equal protection under the law,'' Bush said. &QL;

AS ANTI-CLINTON AD CAMPAIGN EXPANDS, DEMOCRATS AIR REBUTTALS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hardly retreating from their attack on President
Clinton's moral behavior, the Republicans have prepared a fourth
anti-Clinton campaign commercial, the toughest yet, that presents
his turnabout apology to the nation last summer as ``legal mumbo
jumbo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember when he looked us in the eye?'' asks the commercial,
tailored to get out the anti-Clinton vote in selected Southern
Republican districts.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Democrats, insisting they can capitalize
on any Republican broadcast blitz, unveiled rebuttal commercials
including a radio ad that begins with the Republicans' tag line
about the president's sex-and-mendacity scandal: ``What did you
tell your kids?''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic ad has one actress playing a mother asking that
question and another instantly responding with a shift of the
subject to education: ``What do you say when they ask why they go
to school in temporary trailers?'' Similar questions about Social
Security and health care follow with the conclusion that
Republicans are more ``obsessed with getting rid of the president''
than serving their constituents.
</P>
<P>
   The clash of commercials over the president's threatened
impeachment is something of a shadow boxing contest since the two
parties, while garnering drumbeat media attention with them here in
the campaign homestretch, are not offering precise details on how
heavy an investment these messages will actually receive beyond the
Beltway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Upwards of a million dollars,'' estimated Democratic National
Committee chairman Steve Grossman, saying he was still trying to
raise that amount Thursday to put the new ads on the air before the
Tuesday election. The Republicans have declined to say how big a
part the scandal ads are playing in their ongoing $10-million drive
to retain control of the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats unveiled two TV commercials at a press conference
that rang with denunciations of their favorite target in past
attack ads, Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich. The commercials
invoke such bread-and-butter issues as Social Security with the
narration concluding: ``Republicans _ so intent on attacking the
president they've forgotten about us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, who have the larger war chest, insist that the
Democrats barely have money for a token TV response and that, in
any case, the most fruitful television air time before Election Day
is already booked. House Democratic Minority Leader Dick Gephardt
was on the phone Thursday soliciting funds to mount the rebuttal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tells you what they're really up to when they have to close
this election with the agenda of Ken Starr,'' said Gephardt at the
Democrats' satellite news conference, aiming in particular at
Starr, the independent counsel who has recommended impeachment of
the president.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt and Grossman accused the Republicans of a desperate
gambit in the scandal ads, one of which questions whether voters
should ``reward'' the president on Election Day.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another replays Clinton's finger-wagging denial of sexual
misconduct in the Oval Office, seven months before he reversed
himself.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Republican ad features the president's admission in
August that he misled the nation but still should be judged
``legally correct'' in his denial under civil court oath of a
sexual affair. The Republican ad also underlines praise from
Grossman for Clinton's ``moral leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not us saying this, it's them,'' emphasized Mary
Crawford, communications director of the Republican Congressional
Campaign Committee. The ad is pegged to the argument that a
Republican majority continues to be needed in Congress as a check
on the president. ``Without the balance Republicans provide just
where would Bill Clinton and Democrats take us?'' the ad asks.
</P>
<P>
   The new Democratic ads respond: ``Will 1999 be a year of
investigation or a year of progress?'' At the unveiling, Grossman
accused the Republicans of presiding over a ``legislative killing
field'' for the past year, then putting ``their real cards on the
table'' with the scandal ads. ``The agenda of the American people
has been held hostage by the Republicans' investigative strategy,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another set of last-minute campaign ads was released by People
for the American Way, a pro-Democratic independent group. ``Yes,
the president let us down,'' one ad concedes, stressing, ``Now it's
time to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   The new ads are notable for repeatedly presenting Starr, the
independent counsel, as the problem. ``Are they gonna listen to us
or Ken Starr?'' asks an actress portraying a mother. Another ad,
entitled ``Had Enough,'' urges voters: ``Don't stay home. Send Ken
Starr home.''

part the scandal ads are playing in their ongoing $10-million drive
to retain control of the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats unveiled two TV commercials at a press conference
that rang with denunciations of their favorite target in past
attack ads, Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich. The commercials
invoke such bread-and-butter issues as Social Security with the
narration concluding: ``Republicans _ so intent on attacking the
president they've forgotten about us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, who have the larger war chest, insist that the
Democrats barely have money for a token TV response and that, in
any case, the most fruitful television air time before Election Day
is already booked. House Democratic Minority Leader Dick Gephardt
was on the phone Thursday soliciting funds to mount the rebuttal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tells you what they're really up to when they have to close
this election with the agenda of Ken Starr,'' said Gephardt at the
Democrats' satellite news conference, aiming in particular at
Starr, the independent counsel who has recommended impeachment of
the president.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt and Grossman accused the Republicans of a desperate
gambit in the scandal ads, one of which questions whether voters
should ``reward'' the president on Election Day.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another replays Clinton's finger-wagging denial of sexual
misconduct in the Oval Office, seven months before he reversed
himself.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Republican ad features the president's admission in
August that he misled the nation but still should be judged
``legally correct'' in his denial under civil court oath of a
sexual affair. The Republican ad also underlines praise from
Grossman for Clinton's ``moral leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not us saying this, it's them,'' emphasized Mary
Crawford, communications director of the Republican Congressional
Campaign Committee. The ad is pegged to the argument that a
Republican majority continues to be needed in Congress as a check
on the president. ``Without the balance Republicans provide just
where would Bill Clinton and Democrats take us?'' the ad asks.
</P>
<P>
   The new Democratic ads respond: ``Will 1999 be a year of
investigation or a year of progress?'' At the unveiling, Grossman
accused the Republicans of presiding over a ``legislative killing
field'' for the past year, then putting ``their real cards on the
table'' with the scandal ads. ``The agenda of the American people
has been held hostage by the Republicans' investigative strategy,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another set of last-minute campaign ads was released by People
for the American Way, a pro-Democratic independent group. ``Yes,
the president let us down,'' one ad concedes, stressing, ``Now it's
time to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   The new ads are notable for repeatedly presenting Starr, the
independent counsel, as the problem. ``Are they gonna listen to us
or Ken Starr?'' asks an actress portraying a mother. Another ad,
entitled ``Had Enough,'' urges voters: ``Don't stay home. Send Ken
Starr home.''

   NEW YORK _ It was the first taste of a voyage to space for
dozens of students at Public School 87 on the Upper West Side of
Manhattan, where two fifth-grade classes and a first-grade class
gathered in front of a television Thursday to watch John Glenn
blast into space for the second time.
</P>
<P>
   There was some fidgeting as the kids _ who didn't get quite the
same charge out of Walter Cronkite that adults of a certain age do
_ waited for the anchors to stop talking and the countdown to
begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just pretend it's a Yankees game,'' one boy remarked.
</P>
<P>
   Across the New York area Thursday, students took a break from
their computer screens and books to catch a glimpse of Glenn's
second launch into space. Of course, in this age of technology,
there was nowhere near the excitement of 36 years ago when Glenn
first took off.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, few schools took special notice of the occasion, except
for a handful driven by teachers and administrators who were there
the first time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a college student at the time,'' said Harvey Sherer,
principal of Public School 102 in Elmhurst, Queens. ``I was 20
years old. I absolutely remember John Glenn orbiting the earth and
Walter Cronkite reporting on it. I even remember that I was sitting
in a student lounge at City College.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherer, whose school was recently awarded the John Glenn Award
by the American Association of School Administrators for being a
leader in technology, said students gathered in the auditorium to
watch the launch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's launch serves as an inspiration in and of itself
because they've been studying and writing letters to him,'' Sherer
said. ``This makes it even larger. It motivates them them to learn
about flight and to see a 77-year-old former astronaut go again
makes them look at their own grandparents in a different way.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of grandparents, Samuel Haile, a fifth-grade student at
Public School 87, knew Glenn was old. But how old? ``Like, he's
sort of like a little bit older than Bill Clinton,'' Samuel said.
``When he was younger, it was probably easier for him. But he's
gonna survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Dangling from the ceiling of the classroom where the students
were gathered at were personal history mobiles made of magazine
clippings and drawings that spoke to the preoccupations of youth
today _ Beastie Boys, Michael Jordan, baseball and aliens, but no
astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Plaut, the principal, turned the sound off on the
television as the children waited for the launch and tried to calm
them with a little history lesson. He talked about how he himself
had watched the first moon launch, on a black and white TV. He
evoked Sputnik and the race for space.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a president of the U.S. who really made a commitment
to the country that before the end of the 20th century, we were
going to have a man on the moon,'' he said. ``Does anybody know who
that was?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kennedy,'' a boy cried out.
</P>
<P>
   Evoking Columbus, he then asked about the first explorer on the
moon. ``Neil Armstrong,'' a girl replied.
</P>
<P>
   As the digital clock on the TV screen ticked off 50 seconds, a
teacher restored the sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shhhh'' filled the room as the final countdown began. Carried
away by the suspense of it all, the children began shouting out the
waning seconds, drowning the voice on screen. As the shuttle lifted
off, they cheered and pumped their fists. It could, after all, have
been a Yankees game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to learn more about John Glenn,'' Samuel said, when it
was over. ``He's brave.''

LEADER OF MILITANT ISLAMIC GROUP ARRESTED AFTER BOMB ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT   AND ALIZA MARCUS   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUSH KATIF JUNCTION, Gaza Strip _ In a direct challenge to the
militant Islamic group Hamas, Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat placed the group's spiritual leader, Sheik Ahmed
Yassin, under house arrest Thursday, hours after a suicide bomber
rammed his car into an Israeli military convoy escorting a
schoolbus.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli soldier was killed in the attack and seven others
were injured, but none of the Israeli children on the bus was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's reponse to the attack is a sign that he is ready to
fufill a promise to crack down on Islamic militants who have vowed
to destroy the peace process. He vehemently condemned the bombing,
and he promised to arrest the masterminds and ``try them for
deliberately harming the Palestinians' national interests.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrest of Yassin, the ailing religious figure who has
symbolized the armed struggle against Israel, is also certain to
unleash Arafat's staunchest political enemies.
</P>
<P>
   It could also leave open the possibility of direct clashes
between the Palestinian Authority police and the armed wing of
Hamas which is certain to protect its revered leader.
</P>
<P>
   Just after the morning bombing, Hamas claimed responsibility for
the attack in a telephone call to Israel Radio. ``It's a revolution
until victory,'' the caller said, suggesting the attacks would
continue.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu began
warning Arafat that he would have to dramatically step up his fight
against terrorism if he wanted the land-for-security deal to
proceed as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   On a dirt road in a squalid neighborhood of Gaza Thursday at
dusk, Palestinian police dressed in military fatigues cordoned off
the area around Yassin's modest home of cinder-block and corrugated
tin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sheik Ahmed Yassin is under house arrest for security
reasons,'' the Palestinian security services said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian police searched and questioned passers-by, while
dozens of suspected Hamas activists were rounded up, according to
Israeli and Palestinian radio reports. One of the Hamas leaders
detained for questioning, Mohammed Zahar, was interviewed by the
Boston Globe Wednesday. During the interview he vowed that Hamas
would continue its struggle and specifically target the Israeli
military.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Arafat's increasing pressure on Hamas, Zahar said,
``Arafat is losing the support of the people and his actions will
do nothing to stop Hamas' struggle against Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   The 7:30 a.m. suicide attack occured on a road that cuts through
the Palestinian controlled area of Gaza and leads to the junction
of Gush Katif, the largest Jewish settlement in Gaza. The blast
injured seven people, including three Palestinian girls who live
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The 40 Israeli children on the bus, ranging in age from 6 to 14,
were unharmed. An Israeli commander said the military jeep had
swerved to keep the car away from the children.
</P>
<P>
   After an agreement between Arafat and Netanyahu was brokered
through nine days of dogged diplomacy last week by President
Clinton, the 12-week West Bank troop pullback is scheduled to begin
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu faces intense pressure from the Israeli far right and
settlers to call off the deal. They have threatened to use their
political clout to topple his fragile coalition government.
</P>
<P>
   And this attack, two weeks after a grenade attack in a crowded
bus station and three days after the shooting of a settler, makes
it harder for Netanyahu to fend off hard-line criticism and to
honor the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure that in the beginning, (Israel's leaders) believed
these agreements would bring peace, even if I never believed it.
But now it has been put to the test, and it is not successful,''
said Shella Shorshom, an Israeli woman and mother of three children
who lives in the Jewish settlement of Kfar Darom in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   The children on the schoolbus targeted by the suicide bomber all
came from this settlement of lush gardens and red-roofed houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had dozens of small coffins lined up here now, would
Prime Minister Netanyahu and the defense minister have understood
this better?'' asked Shorshom, who said her husband was slain seven
years ago by Palestinian militants when Gaza was still under full
Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
   The 6,000 Jewish settlers who live in the small settlements
scattered throughout Gaza, most of which is under
Palestinian-self-rule, are no strangers to attacks. Three years
ago, an Islamic militant rammed a van full of explosives into an
Israeli bus near Kfar Darom. Eight people were killed, including a
20-year-old Jewish student from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things aren't new. There was and there will be more
</P>
<P>
   attacks,'' said Yossi Hadad, a 30-year-old father of four
children. ``And they said this will be an agreement for peace, but
we could have had a situation where every family in Kfar Darom had
one child dead.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Palestinian military official said that the Palestinian
Authority would do everything it could to track down the people
behind the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't good, and it's not good for us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has in the past arrested lower-level figures of Hamas and
his security forces moved quickly to arrest the two suspects in the
killing of Israeli settler Danny Vargas in the West bank city of
Hebron earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   But he has never has taken on Yassin, who is widely considered
to pose the greatest threat to Arafat politically. In fact, Arafat
has frequently gone out of his way to appear friendly with Yassin
whose network of schools, clinics, and religious insitutions
provide a much-needed safety net for the desperately poor in Gaza
and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Wheelchair-bound and blind in one eye, &UR;  &LR; Yassin was released from
an Israeli prison last year in exchange for the freedom of two
Israeli Mossad agents who were caught in a bungled assassination
attempt on another Hamas leader in Amman, Jordan. The frail Yassin
had already served eight years of a life term for ordering the
killings of Israeli soldiers and Palestinians accused of
collaborating with the Israelis.

FOR PAYLOAD SPECIALIST NO. 2, NINE DAYS OF HARD WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   All of the world's media attention on Thursday's launch was
focused squarely on the lowest-ranking crew member, John Glenn,
Payload Specialist No. 2. But now that Glenn and his crewmates have
left all the hoopla and adulation safely 340 miles below them, they
can focus on what Glenn has said all along is the chief purpose of
the mission: An intensive nine days of hard work on real science.
</P>
<P>
   And much of their work will be aimed at helping astronauts
function better in the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's upcoming missions that will expose them to space
for longer and longer periods: The soon-to-be-assembled
International Space Station, and eventual missions to Mars.
</P>
<P>
   While some have questioned the value of having Glenn, 77, as a
single subject to test the effects of weightlessness on an older
astronaut, nobody questions the overall importance of the wide
array of scientific research he and the other six Discovery
astronauts will be carrying out.
</P>
<P>
   And even though Glenn represents just a single case of how a
stint in space will affect an older person, his reactions could
provide important clues that could set the direction for future,
more detailed research, said Laurence Young, Apollo professor at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Department of Aeronautics
and Astronautics and lead scientist for one of the shuttle
experiments.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a very important area of research is on how the
sense of balance deteriorates with age, just as it tends to
deteriorate during space flight even for young astronauts. It's
possible that by combining the two cases in a single individual,
this mission could yield some clues that point the way for future
research, Young said Thursday in a telephone interview from Cape
Canaveral.
</P>
<P>
   Young takes a keen interest in the effects of space travel on
aging because he was selected as an astronaut in 1991, and although
he never ended up flying a mission, at the time he was the oldest
person ever to begin astronaut training. At 56, he was just a few
months older than Story Musgrave, America's most experienced
astronaut, who until Thursday held the record for being the oldest
person to fly in space (he was 61 during his last flight).
</P>
<P>
   Young's research could someday become a life-or-death matter for
astronauts having to deal with an emergency landing, or help
astronauts arriving on Mars after six months in space to move fast
without falling over. And the same research could also be important
in helping older people on Earth deal with one of their most
pervasive medical problems.
</P>
<P>
   Loss of balance is ``the second-largest cause of
hospitalizations for people over 65,'' said Young, who is also the
director of the National Space Biomedical Research Institute. The
loss of balance causes 50 percent of the falls older people
experience, which can often lead to hip fractures from which many
older people never fully recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kind of rehabilitation'' to overcome the deterioration of
the sense of balance ``that's good for the astronauts should be
good for the elderly,'' Young said. Research on such measures, he
said, is in its infancy, but Glenn's flight could help to provide
clues for future research.
</P>
<P>
   This research on the effects of zero-gravity flight on the human
body and its relationship to normal aging is just one part of the
crew's multifaceted scientific work during this busy nine days
aloft. The crew also will be testing new devices for the Hubble
space telescope, studying the radiation environment in space, and
testing the growth of crystals and the processing of antibiotics _
among dozens of other tests.
</P>
<P>
   One experiment that could be of great value for future
astronauts is a laptop computer that will play the role of an
artificial scientist. Called ``P.I. in a Box'' (using the acronym
for principal investigator, or the scientist in charge of an
experiment), the computer will act as an onboard surrogate for the
researcher who designed one of the experiments.
</P>
<P>
   As Glenn and other astronauts wire themselves up each night to
monitor their brainwaves, eye movements, heartbeat, and muscle
movements while they sleep, the computer will monitor the various
devices they attach to themselves to make sure everything is
working properly. Since the crew is normally not in communication
with the ground during this pre-sleep period, a whole night's sleep
research could be lost if they failed to attach an electrode just
right.
</P>
<P>
   But by having the computer monitor the process, Glenn and his
crewmates can get instant feedback.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as close as you can get to having the researcher on
board,'' said Young. And when the space station becomes fully
operational, with dozens of different experiments running at once,
that capability could become essential.
</P>
<P>
   It could take the place of scientists like him, Young said.
``Not that I wouldn't want to go,'' he said, ``but I'm not old
enough yet.''

PALESTINIAN SUICIDE BOMBER KILLS HIMSELF, SOLDIER IN ATTACK ON
SCHOOL BUS 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   GUSH KATIF, Gaza Strip _ A Palestinian suicide bomber, aiming
for a bus full of Israeli schoolchildren, Thursday blew himself up
outside a Jewish settlement here, killing one soldier and wounding
seven other people.
</P>
<P>
   None of the children was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, Palestinian police placed Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the
spiritual leader of the militant Islamic organization Hamas, under
house arrest after the group took responsibility for the bombing.
The Palestinians also arrested about 15 Hamas members and called in
four other leaders of the organization for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing, the first suicide attack in Israel in months, came
six days after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat signed a new peace agreement. It's
implementation is scheduled to begin next week.
</P>
<P>
   According to the army, the attack occurred about 7:30 a.m. as
two jeeps full of soldiers were escorting a school bus carrying
about 40 children of Jewish settlers into an Israeli-controlled
part of the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   When a car tried to drive alongside the bus, the lead jeep
maneuvered in between, and in doing so, took the brunt of the
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   One soldier, identified as Alexei Neykov, 19, was killed, and
three other soldiers were wounded. Three Palestinian girls were
injured when the roof of a nearby farm shack collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the soldiers hadn't (moved in between the bus), there could
have been a situation where in every house there would have been a
dead child,'' said Yossi Hadad, whose 6-year-old daughter, Cheli,
was riding in a minivan behind the school bus.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat's response to Thursday's attack would be a
``test'' of the Palestinian commitment to fight terror as agreed in
the new accord negotiated at the Wye River conference center in
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him that the test will be the absolute enlistment of
the Palestinian Authority against terrorists,'' Netanyahu said.
``He told me he had just emerged from a meeting with his security
chiefs and had given them instructions in that spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (he) meets (his) obligation, we will carry out ours,''
Netanyahu said. ``I hope they will meet the test successfully.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis pledged to hand over an additional 13 percent of
the West Bank in return for specific Palestinian steps to combat
terrorism. The accord sparked violent protests by settlers and
their supporters, the apparent tit-for-tat killings in the West
Bank of a settler and a Palestinian.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat condemned Thursday's attack and said that the
perpetrators would be tried for ``deliberately harming the
Palestinians' national interests.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will exert all effort to disclose who stood behind this
terrorist act which was directed against the schoolchildren,''
Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing made Netanyahu's task of convincing his hard-line
coalition partners to back the Wye agreement a notch more
difficult, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, he returned to Israel to find widespread opposition
to the deal from several members of his Cabinet and Likud Party.
Protests were held at his red-carpet welcoming ceremony and across
the West Bank. One coalition member, the National Religious Party,
withdrew its support for the prime minister and worked with the
opposition Labor Party to write a proposed law that would bring
about new elections.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu has postponed a Cabinet vote to ratify the Wye
agreement but Thursday's attack did not appear to disrupt the
timetable for implementation of the deal. He fell short of
suggesting that the attack would delay implementation, set to begin
on Nov. 2.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton suggested the bombing should
not deter peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the important thing is they all made commitments to do
certain things on a certain timetable, and no one should step off
of that,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Hamas has threatened to block any Palestinian-Israeli peace, and
it has launched suicide attacks that have killed dozens of
Israelis. Its attacks have paralyzed peace negotiations and helped
pave the way for Netanyahu's election.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's attack suggested that Hamas' military wing may be
more active and organized that previously thought, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Recent attacks carried out by the group have been limited to
individual stabbings and grenade throwing, a possible sign that the
militants were failing to carry out larger operations.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Thursday's attack, the Palestinian Authority
arrested 15 suspected Hamas members from Khan Younis, the
Palestinian town closest to the Gush Katif settlement where
Thursday's bombing occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the Palestinians put Sheikh Yassin, the group's
61-year-old wheelchair-bound founder, under house arrest. Yassin
denied knowledge of the bombing, but a caller to Israel Radio,
claiming to be from Hamas, said the organization was responsible
for what he termed a ``wonderful operation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a revolution until victory,'' the caller said.
</P>
<P>
   The development was a surprising move by Arafat because he has
seemed to bend over backwards to avoid a confrontation with Yassin,
a rival for the leadership of the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli police said they had not yet identified the bomber,
whose charred body was found near the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon, dozens of Israeli soldiers, investigators and
bomb experts milled around the burned-out remains of the school
bus. Palestinians living in aluminum shacks nearby passed by on
donkey carts. Most of the children had been taken home or to
school.
</P>
<P>
   David Giber, a 14-year-old who had been on the bus, said he was
more angry than scared after the bombing happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palestinians are not holding to their part of the
agreement,'' he said, riding his bike through the nearby settlement
of Ganei Tal.
</P>
<P>
   Yossi Hadad, whose daughter was in the minivan behind the bus,
said he heard the explosion and ran to the scene to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``My girl, she saw the (bus) driver with blood on his face and
she was upset and crying,'' he said. ``I took her, and we went and
ate some ice cream, and then I took her to the zoo. Then I took her
to school.''
</P>
<P>
   Hadad, echoing many of the 5,000 settlers here, said he did not
foresee an end to violence, even if peace agreements were
implemented.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were things like this before the agreement,'' he said.
``There will be again.''

ARCHIMEDES TEXT SOLD FOR $2 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (lb) 
 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A scorched and moldy volume of thousand-year-old pages _ the
oldest surviving copy of important mathematical works of Archimedes
_ was sold at auction Thursday for $2 million, double the expected
price.
</P>
<P>
   The winning bid, at Christie's of New York City, was made by
Simon Finch, a London book dealer, who said he was acting on behalf
of an unidentified private American collector. The seller was
identified only as a French family that acquired the volume in the
early 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   The volume includes copies of two of Archimedes' greatest works:
``Method of Mechanical Theorems,'' which includes ideas startlingly
reminiscent of modern calculus, and ``On Floating Bodies,'' which
puts forth his laws of flotation.
</P>
<P>
   They are in palimpsest form: that is, the original inked copy of
Archimedes' texts, written by a 10th-century scribe, was washed off
by Byzantine monks in the 13th century so that the expensive vellum
on which it was written could be reused. The Archimedes text was
made almost illegible by the washing and then covered by the later
religious text.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's commissioned experts to examine a few pages of the
manuscript, illuminating them with ultraviolet light and using
computer programs to enhance the Archimedes text. The project was
strikingly successful. Mathematicians believe that the improved
text may reveal unsuspected nuances in Archimedes' scientific
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   The new owner of the palimpsest (pronounced PAL-imp-sest) will
pay $2,202,500, including commissions and taxes, and may soon face
a lawsuit from the Greek Orthodox patriarch of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, Simos Dimas, a New York lawyer representing the
patriarch, sought an injunction in U.S. District Court to block the
auction and lay claim to the volume, on grounds that it was stolen
some time after World War I. The judge denied the motion, and
Christie's announced that ``our consigner has clear title to sell
the manuscript.''
</P>
<P>
   Dimas, who attended the auction, said his legal challenge would
continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under New York law, stolen property cannot be sold, even if
the seller himself is not the thief,'' he said. ``This palimpsest
is part of the patrimony of the patriarchate.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Rorres, a professor of mathematics at Drexel University,
in Philadelphia, and an Archimedes scholar who attended the
auction, expressed disappointment with the sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the worst possible outcome,'' Rorres said. ``It means
that this priceless work may once again disappear into obscurity,
cut off from scholars who could mine its riches.''
</P>
<P>
   But Felix de Maraz Oyens, a Christie's expert on ancient
manuscripts, offered some consolation. De Maraz Oyens, who knows
the identity of both the seller and the buyer, predicted that
scholars would be given access to the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The buyer told me he would allow such access,'' he said. ``I
cannot tell you who it is, except to say that it is not Bill
Gates.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft Corp., has bought several
valuable manuscripts, including the Leicester Codex, a notebook of
Leonardo da Vinci.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Archimedes, the greatest mathematical genius of antiquity, is
particularly admired by modern mathematicians for having devised a
method that prefigured the invention of calculus for computing
relationships between geometrical objects.
</P>
<P>
   His laws of flotation dictate the design of ships and define the
concept of specific gravity.
</P>
<P>
   Archimedes was slain by a Roman soldier during the sack of
Syracuse in 212 B.C. Isaac Newton invented modern calculus some 19
centuries later, presumably drawing from Archimedes' ideas.

 &HT;    Lt. gov. hopeful makes opponent's drug problem an ad issue
 &HT;    By Jay Croft and Sandra Eckstein
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The most controversial image in Campaign '98 looms
over the lieutenant governor's race with wider-ranging effects and
implications than ever intended.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than convincing voters that his Democratic opponent, Mark
Taylor, has a drug problem, ads by Republican Mitch Skandalakis
have taken on a life of their own as an issue that could help
decide the race.
</P>
<P>
   A TV spot includes the sign of Ridgeview Institute, a well-known
drug rehab center, and a later scene shows a shadowy figure of
Taylor's build walking down a nondescript hall. A voice says: ``We
all wish ... those problems had been cured,'' a reference to
Taylor's admission that he used cocaine and marijuana in the early
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor and many observers say the commercial strongly implies
the state senator was treated for addiction and still uses drugs,
all of which Taylor denies.
</P>
<P>
   Skandalakis has offered nothing to back up his accusations,
though when asked point-blank in a forum last week if he thought
Taylor was still using drugs, he responded: ``Yes, I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor has sued him for slander in Fulton County Superior Court,
seeking $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Legally, nothing will be decided in the lawsuit until after
Tuesday's election. But politically, Skandalakis' ad and Taylor's
response raise questions not only about both men, but about the
nature of campaigning and how down-and-dirty voters are willing to
let candidates get, particularly Skandalakis.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's drug use is just one volley of Skandalakis' largely
negative campaign tactics. In another TV ad, he calls Atlanta Mayor
Bill Campbell ``an incompetent boob,'' and he has tied Taylor to
Atlanta's black political and gay communities. He's also settled
two other slander suits, including another filed during a political
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really pushes the envelope as to what's acceptable,'' said
Michael Binford, a campaign and elections expert at Georgia State
University. ``I don't know how you break the envelope with
political ads. I don't know that you can. You finally stop when you
realize that you don't win elections that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Skandalakis, normally one of the most accessible elected
officials in the area, has grown uncharacteristically quiet about
substantiating his implied claim about Taylor since being sued.
</P>
<P>
   At least a half dozen requests made to his campaign office and
his attorney, Robert Proctor, Tuesday and Wednesday to discuss the
issue went unanswered. When confronted about it at a news
conference Wednesday, Skandalakis said he wanted to discuss it, but
later his staff said that at the urging of Proctor he could not
discuss the issue because of Taylor's pending lawsuit. Fred Davis,
the California media consultant for Skandalakis, said the campaign
was contacted by a very credible source, who said they could
provide proof that Taylor continued to have a drug problem. He said
the decision was made to draw up the television commercial, and the
source was supposed to provide the proof in two or three days.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I know, that ad is dead accurate,'' Davis said.
``Someone very credible came to them with the implication they
could provide a document, then that person got cold feet and didn't
provide it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Davis said, the commercial was ready to go and
with the election only a few weeks away there was little time or
money to do another ad to replace it. Davis points out that the ad
never says Taylor has a drug problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just shows the sign through some trees and a guy who looks
like him (Taylor) in a hospital setting,'' Davis said. ``If you
assume it means that, you must know his history.''
</P>
<P>
   But Davis admits Skandalakis is now between a rock and a hard
place, having run the ad before getting verification.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's very sorry he ran the ad,'' Davis said. ``I don't
think he's sorry because it's wrong, but because he ran it before
he got verification.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally, Skandalakis, 40, of Sandy Springs, is one of the most
accessible elected officials in the area. He also is often
criticized as a politician who shoots from the hip and sometimes
shoots off his mouth. He has referred to Martin Luther King III,
whom he defeated in the 1994 race to become Fulton County
Commission chairman, as ``a momma's boy'' and to Taylor as ``a big,
fat, spoiled baby.'' He has called various county employees
``idiot,'' ``dolt'' and ``pencil-neck geek.''
</P>
<P>
   He prides himself on his ability to stir things up. So does
Proctor, a longtime friend and ally who most recently interceded in
Fulton's property tax collections by convincing a court that the
county did not set the millage rate properly so the county now must
collect 1998 taxes using the 1997 property values and millage rate.
</P>
<P>
   Skandalakis settled the earlier libel suits out of court.
</P>
<P>
   The first suit was filed in 1991 by the company that conducted
property revaluations for Fulton County. Skandalakis, at the fore
of a taxpayer revolt against the revaluations, accused the company
of charging Fulton for work done in another county and of buying
used equipment while charging the county for new gear. In the
settlement, which did not disclose if damages were paid,
Skandalakis said he had no evidence of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1995, Skandalakis and three others settled a lawsuit
by County Commissioner Gordon Joyner over an election flier that
depicted Joyner with exaggerated features including thicker lips
and an Afro.
</P>
<P>
   Skandalakis was not originally named in that lawsuit, but was
added after he admitted he paid for the flier. He also was fined by
the state ethics commission for surpassing the legal limit for
campaign contributions, because the flier cost more than $18,000,
and the limit is $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Skandalakis has been fined three times by the state ethics board
for campaign violations, mostly for failing to fill out campaign
disclosures properly.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Taylor sued Skandalakis over the drug allegations,
which the South Georgian said ``are character assassination'' that
go ``beyond the realm of politics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mitch Skandalakis' ad does not have a grain of truth to it,''
added Taylor, who has produced a letter from Ridgeview, where
Skandalakis claims Taylor spent time in December 1997. The letter
says the hospital can find no record of Taylor ever receiving
treatment there.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital attorney Dan Reinhardt said the hospital, at Taylor's
written request, searched for anyone with Taylor's name, Social
Security number or birthday, and found no one. Reinhardt said he
did not know if it was possible for Taylor to be admitted under
another name, but Taylor swears he has never been in a rehab
center.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, 41, admits he used cocaine and marijuana in the early
'80s, but insists there has been no drug use since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a member of the General Assembly, I have taken a drug test
every two years since 1990, and they've all been negative,'' said
Taylor, a 11-year state senator from Albany.
</P>
<P>
   His staff produced his most recent drug test, taken Oct. 7, that
shows Taylor had no drugs in his system. ``I used drugs when I was
young and childish, and I was blessed that I was never arrested or
addicted.''
</P>
<P>
   The drug issue arose when papers from Taylor's 1988 divorce were
mailed to a newspaper earlier this year. Shortly after he got
custody of their son in January, Robin Virginia Coble Taylor filed
a motion for visitation, claiming she was having problems seeing
the teen.
</P>
<P>
   The petition also alleges that Taylor was not properly
supervising the boy, ``which has resulted in the deterioration of
his grades at school and his detrimental exposure to alcohol, drugs
and sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said he will submit a written medical disclosure form to
``any rehab hospital anywhere in the galaxy'' if Skandalakis or the
press request it to prove he hasn't been treated for drug
addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Virginia Coble Taylor, declined to discuss Taylor or their
divorce. Her attorney, Pamela Tremayne, said Taylor's ex-wife is
looking out for the best interest of the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say Taylor is unlikely to win his lawsuit and
predict he will dismiss it after the election, although Taylor
insists he will not.
</P>
<P>
   Courts have made it clear they should not be ``judging the
veracity of campaign charges,'' said political analyst Larry Sabato
of the University of Virginia. ``The Supreme Court has said that
some forms of speech are critical to the functioning of a healthy
democracy, and political speech is clearly one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Suits like Taylor's are unusual but not unheard of. This week,
U.S. Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri was sued by his underdog
opponent, William J. Federer, over ads challenging Federer's
record. In Maryland's 1994 Republican primary, Senate candidate
Ruthann Aron sued her opponent after he said she was ``convicted''
and ``guilty'' in a previous lawsuit that had, in fact, been
settled. A jury rejected her claim that rival Bill Brock committed
slander.
</P>
<P>
   Voters steadily say they don't like negative campaigning, even
when most of it is about a campaigner's public record and based, at
least in some measure, on a verifiable fact.
</P>
<P>
   Skandalakis may be testing voters' patience by going after
Taylor's personal life and offering nothing as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand why Taylor would be upset,'' Binford said.
``But is it libel or likely to be proven in a court of law?
Probably not.''
</P>
<P>
   To win his lawsuit, Taylor must prove that Skandalakis knew his
ad was false or acted recklessly, a tougher standard than the mere
negligence private citizens must prove. A long suit would be costly
_ and would open Taylor to potentially embarrassing questions in
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have lived less than a saintly life, it's probably not
a good idea to bring a libel suit,'' said William Lee, a professor
of communications law at the University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   But experts say Taylor's lawsuit has helped him politically. It
has lead some to question the integrity of Skandalakis' ad, making
it an issue for voters _ moreso than the courts _ to decide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only way to judge,'' Sabato said. ``The limits are
enforced by voters on election day. Let's see what happens on
Tuesday.

 &HT;    Discovery shuttles kids' experiment into space
 &HT;    By Chris Reinolds
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Alex Standridge, age 7 1/2, sat on the edge of her
seat and fidgeted anxiously as her (cq) scientific experiment
blasted into space Thursday along with legendary astronaut John
Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the chalk already broke and the crayons melted,'' Alex
said after the space shuttle Discovery launched at 2:19 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Alex and her classmates gathered at Dowell Elementary in Cobb
County to watch the shuttle transport their experiments. The class
is among eight in the nation whose experiments were chosen to fly
aboard the nine-day shuttle mission as part of the space agency's
student education program.

   The students' experiment, which NASA has dubbed ``Effects of
Microgravity on an Object's Physical Characteristics,'' will fly in
a container in the shuttle's cargo bay. Inside the container are 20
vials containing a variety of everyday items: chewing gum, popcorn,
bread, stickers, paper clips, chalk, crayons and bubble wrap. The
students will examine the objects back on earth to see if there are
any changes.
</P>
<P>
   Dowell's experiment was selected by NASA after first-grade
teacher Andrea Apple submitted her class' proposal over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Apple was at the launch Thursday sitting in VIP bleachers. She
called her students just before the shuttle fired up its main
engines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so proud of you guys,'' Apple said over the school's
intercom. ``I was just thinking about you and wanted to call.''
</P>
<P>
   During her call Apple and several teachers in the school gulped
back tears. But the students remained transfixed to the big screen
television.
</P>
<P>
   Although Apple has moved to teach at Cobb's Nickajack Elementary
and last year's first-grades have split up into different
second-grade classes, they all came together to view the launch.
</P>
<P>
   The children squealed and cheered, and then grew quiet as the
shuttle arced toward the east.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it doesn't blow up,'' one little boy said. ``Make it,
make it, make it,'' another little girl whispered.
</P>
<P>
   After the craft disappeared from sight, the second-graders
relaxed and started to cheer again.
</P>
<P>
   Principal Cheryl Hungerford said there were no words to describe
her feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is history and they get to live it,'' Hungerford said.

 &HT;    Thousands tailgate, cheer shuttle into blue yonder
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ Hot dogs sizzled on the grill, vendors
hawked T-shirts and space Beanie Babies, kids cavorted in the sun
and anxious shutterbugs gripped lenses and tripods, waiting for
history to repeat itself.
</P>
<P>
   And when John Glenn roared into space for his second mission in
36 years, thousands of spectators roared, too, cheering as a
gleaming white space shuttle Discovery thundered into a perfect
blue sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was awesome,'' said Luther Aubrey, 38, who watched the
historic mission from one of the causeways crossing the Banana
River a few miles south of the Kennedy Space Center. ``Look at that
ball of fire. That's some horsepower, there, buddy.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's return to space brought back a touch of bygone glory to
Florida's Space Coast, which in the 1960s drew the nation's
breathless attention with every launch.
</P>
<P>
   Officials expected as many as 250,000 spectators for the
mission, at least double the number normally drawn to a shuttle
launch. Firm figures on the actual turnout weren't readily
available, but cars and motor homes packed nearly every inch of
road shoulder near the spots that afford open views of the launch
pad.
</P>
<P>
   Lamar Hamill, manager of Cherokee County near Atlanta, was
attending a conference in Orlando and extended his stay one day to
see history being made.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a tailgate party before a Braves game with all these
people here,'' he said, stretching out with hundreds of others on
the slope of a bridge embankment that made a perfect grandstand.
``It's better than watching Mickey Mouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of boats moored in the Indian and Banana rivers, while
thousands more spectators jammed the white sand beaches of Cape
Canaveral and Cocoa Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen one before and it's the greatest experience,''
said Rhysa Russo, who left her home in nearby Lakeland early
Thursday to get a good viewing spot. ``I've never seen anything
like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the spectators were on previously planned Florida
vacations and simply added the shuttle launch to their itineraries.
But others made a special trip just to see the 77-year-old Glenn's
much-ballyhooed return mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came because he's old,'' said Maria Christina Salveston, a
native of Colombia who now lives near Miami. ``Some people think
when they get old they have no hope and no future, but he's showing
us that the life you have you must live it full up to the last
second you have.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitch and Gail Nowicki of Hawaii were in the middle of a
months-long family tour of the mainland United States and brought
their three young children to see the lift-off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's perfect timing,'' said Gail Nowicki. ``In Hawaii, they
don't get much American history, and now they can see it with their
own eyes. In Hawaii, you never think you'll get to see anything
like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the Georgians who journeyed to the launch were about 60
students from Brentwood High School in Sandersville. One of them,
Lauren Ray, 14, chatted by cell phone with her father, who was
watching the liftoff on television back in Sandersville.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of families arrived Wednesday night, camping in tents and
recreational vehicles. Some waited through the morning Thursday,
skeptical that the launch would come off without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took them four White Russians, but they talked me into
it,'' said Ralph Bowser, 54, of Clearwater, who set up his
motorhome near the Banana River as a base for a group of friends.
``The last time I came to one of these we waited a day and a night
and it never went off.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, Bowser wasn't disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Anxious spectators had to endure only a 20-minute delay. When
the countdown resumed, the crowd shouted as one, yelling out the
last numbers to lift-off.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching zero, they cheered mightily as white clouds of smoke
billowed from the distant launchpad and Discovery nosed skyward
atop a plume of flame.
</P>
<P>
   The cheering stopped as the space ship hurtled upward. As the
seconds ticked away, there was mostly silence, a hush expectancy
perhaps mindful of the terrible explosion that destroyed the
shuttle Challenger in 1986 about 90 seconds into flight when the
booster separation went awry.
</P>
<P>
   But on this day Discovery climbed steadily, trailing a dense
column of white smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, its rumbling shock wave of sound boomed across the
river, leaving more than a few gasping at the power of the space
machine.
</P>
<P>
   And then one or two yelled that they could see the boosters, two
silvery specks far above, dropping away from a fast-departing fiery
dot.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd cheered again, this time almost in relief, with one
man letting out a rebel yell.
</P>
<P>
   ``There they go!'' whooped Luther Aubrey. ``There they go!

 &HT;    Good news of Glenn flight showcased well on TV
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Television knows the right stuff. Not just that
``amalgam of stamina, guts, fast neural synapses and old-fashioned
hell-raising'' that was Tom Wolfe's shorthand for the character of
the original Mercury 7 astronauts in his 1979 best-seller.
</P>
<P>
   No, the TV coverage of John Glenn's return to space Thursday
afternoon had stuff that was even more righteous, a gee-whiz
genuine news story without ambivalence or ambiguity, one in which
anchors didn't have to squirm as they presented R-rated details of
presidential sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, there's something to cheer for,'' said NBC anchor Tom
Brokaw about an hour before lift-off. ``There's kind of unalloyed
good news here. Everyone can feel good about this mission and John
Glenn.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not mention the contrast between this story and the story
the media have been obsessing over all year, nor did he have to.
Television got it, and instinctively, we got it as well.
</P>
<P>
   And TV got something else, as well _ that this was an occasion
to bring out the veterans. Most notably, this meant Walter
Cronkite, who turns 82 in five days, co-anchoring the launch for
CNN with Miles O'Brien. But the veterans' day parade wasn't limited
to the return of Uncle Walter to Cape Canaveral.
</P>
<P>
   Of the seven original Mercury astronauts, three are dead, one
was returning to space, and the other three were all live on TV.
ABC had Wally Schirra, NBC had Scott Carpenter (who said
``Godspeed, John Glenn'' at Glenn's first launch in 1962, and said
it again Thursday), and CBS had Gordon Cooper. In addition, there
were such blast-offs from the past as former NASA director Chris
Kraft on ABC, Apollo astonaut Jim Lovell on Fox News Channel, and
moon-walker Buzz Aldrin on CNN. CNN even set up a remote to
interview Chuck Yeager, the test pilot who was the granddaddy of
the original right stuff, according to Tom Wolfe.
</P>
<P>
   Even many of the hundreds of thousands who gathered on the
Florida coast to watch the space shuttle Discovery take off were of
an age that TV normally ignores. ``It's like Woodstock, except for
old people,'' ABC's Peter Jennings said of the throng, and not with
disrespect.
</P>
<P>
   It was a day of wattles, wrinkles, liver spots and tapping into
decades and decades of cumulative experience. Not a lot of pretty
faces, just a lot of knowledge and wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to CNN's O'Brien, who had the toughest job in TV
news on Thursday. Not only did O'Brien have to share the spotlight
with Cronkite, an icon of both journalism and coverage of U.S.
space exploration, but he was replacing John Holliman, the CNN
space reporter who was supposed to have been calling Thursday's
lift-off, but who was killed in a car crash last month. Not only
did CNN dedicate its coverage Thursday to Holliman (who was
enormously popular around the CNN newsroom), but President Clinton,
in a live interview on CNN, praised Holliman.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, O'Brien had to be CNN's traffic cop, moving
coverage along and segueing to commercial breaks. But even cutting
O'Brien plenty of slack for the no-win position he was in, there
was no excuse for how often he interrupted Cronkite or stepped on
his lines. The worst case came when Cronkite was interviewing
Clinton live, and O'Brien jumped in to announce that NASA was
putting the countdown on hold _ a hold that was scheduled, not a
problem, and that CNN had been telling viewers over and over was
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien had done his homework (boy, had he done his homework),
but he doesn't have Holliman's affable ease. It's not that he's
some young pup who was in over his head. But sitting next to
Cronkite, who was as sharp as ever, he made it at times painfully
clear that Thursday was that time when the old dogs had their day.

 &HT;    N.C. senator plays Clinton card on hard-charging Democrat
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, N.C. _ Back in July when polls had him leading his
Democratic opponent by 10 points, Sen. Lauch Faircloth (R-N.C.)
hardly mentioned President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with polls showing his Senate race a dead heat, the
70-year-old hog farmer has turned his flagging re-election campaign
against Democrat John Edwards into a referendum on the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a Bill Clinton clone,'' Faircloth said of Edwards here
in the heart of North Carolina tobacco country. ``He says one
thing, he does something else. He stretches the truth to the
breaking point.''
</P>
<P>
   Faircloth's rhetoric on the stump is being amplified on the
airwaves with three hard-hitting television spots that tar Edwards
and Clinton as ``two tobacco-taxing liberals North Carolina can't
afford.''
</P>
<P>
   While several House candidates around the country are attempting
to use Clinton against their opponents, and the Republican Party
this week targeted some anti-Clinton ads in more than two dozen
House districts, Faircloth is taking the anti-Clinton message to
new heights and is the only statewide candidate making the
president such a prominent issue.
</P>
<P>
   Faircloth's TV ads don't mention Monica Lewinsky, but selected
radio ads playing in rural areas are making the president's
personal conduct his theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election is about trust, honor and integrity,'' says one
spot playing here in eastern Carolina, where Democrats outnumber
Republicans. ``Character does count.''
</P>
<P>
   Faircloth, whose anti-Clinton message emerged after he hired a
new consultant two weeks ago, said Edwards made Clinton an issue by
inviting him to raise money for him in Raleigh in July, prior to
his admission that he lied about his relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said he probably wouldn't have invited Clinton down
after that disclosure, but, ``at the time, it was the right thing
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's popularity here is certainly mixed,'' said
Edwards, a 45-year-old Raleigh trial lawyer making his first run
for public office. ``The difference is that people here know that I
am a political outsider. I have many issues where I clearly
disagree with the president. I have made that very clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Observers here are divided on how well Faircloth's Clinton
gambit will work. Republican consultant Paul Shumaker said Clinton
remains immensely unpopular in the Tarheel State even though
Clinton's approval ratings elsewhere are at record highs.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel like he's embarrassed us and brought shame to the
country,'' Shumaker said.
</P>
<P>
   But Thad Beyle, a University of North Carolina political
scientist, said Clinton is old news among scandal-weary voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some evidence out there that people are tired of all
this,'' Beyle said. The liberal tag, used repeatedly in North
Carolina politics and elsewhere in the South for more than a
decade, may also be beginning to lose some of its impact, Beyle
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a red flag to some people who still hate liberals,'' he
said. ``But I think they were going to vote Republican anyhow. ...
I don't think it has the same punch.''
</P>
<P>
   A new poll broadcast Thursday shows Faircloth leading Edwards
44-43 percent, with Faircloth down one point since a similar poll
was taken two weeks ago. The figures are within the poll's margin
of error.
</P>
<P>
   In the closing days of the fall campaign, North Carolina has
emerged as one of the key races around the country. Republicans are
trying to obtain a filibuster-proof majority of 60 in the Senate,
but that formula depends on holding seats in North Carolina and New
York, another state where the GOP incumbent, Alfonse D'Amato, is in
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans from around the country _ Bob and Elizabeth Dole,
former Education Secretary Bill Bennett and Sen. Mitch McConnell
(R-Ky.) _ have swept through North Carolina in the past week to
turn the race for Faircloth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The job of the president ... is to stand for first and
foremost the integrity of the system itself,'' said Bennett, whose
brother is the president's lawyer, at a student rally Thursday.
``This president has failed. People all over this country must
register their principled discontent.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, whose telegenic looks are eerily similar to Robert
Kennedy's, has waged a surprisingly effective campaign against the
older, more experienced Faircloth, a one-time Democrat who switched
parties in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Striking a populist pose, Edwards has refused all contributions
from political action committees and is funding his campaign out of
his own pocket, injecting $1.1 million of his own money since Oct.
15.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards has run only one negative ad against Faircloth, but he
appears to be benefiting from nearly $1.5 million in soft-money
``issue ads'' being aired on his behalf by the state Democratic
Party with financial support from the national party.
</P>
<P>
   The latest ad criticized Faircloth for proposing to weaken clean
water laws and reminds voters that Faircloth's farms were fined for
discharging 80,000 gallons of sweet potato sludge into an eastern
Carolina river, killing more than 6,000 fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a little negative for my taste, but I don't have
anything to do with them,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the party's ads, Edwards appears to be benefiting from
the perception that Faircloth has waged the nastier campaign,
according to voters interviewed here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strategy of Edwards was to let the party do the negative
stuff and let John Edwards act holier than thou,'' said Richard
Hudson, spokesman for the state Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   In the final days, both candidates have targeted voters in
Charlotte, the Research Triangle around Raleigh-Durham and eastern
North Carolina. Observers say the race may turn on the so-called
``Jessecrats'' of the east, traditionally Democratic voters who
tend to vote for Republicans such as Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) at
the federal level.
</P>
<P>
   Faircloth has called on Helms twice in the past week to help
turn out his supporters, most recently here in Smithfield on
Wednesday. Surrounded by bales of bright-yellow tobacco at the
country's largest volume tobacco warehouse, Helms invoked the state
sacred cow and warned Edwards would be ``obligated'' to support
another effort to raise cigarette taxes if elected.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards brought his campaign to Faircloth's doorstep Thursday,
rallying with Democratic Gov. Jim Hunt in Clinton, Faircloth's
hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come Tuesday, we are going to have a resounding rejecting of
the tired, old, hateful politics of the past,'' Edwards told a
boisterous rally of 500 Democrats. ``We can make people believe
again.

 &HT;    Lab tests for clues in triple killing complete
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Police should know definitively whether the
same gun was used in the Atlanta Hilton &AMP; Towers triple homicide
and a slaying at a Days Inn in College Park. The state crime lab
has completed all forensics tests and sent the results on to local
police, a Georgia Bureau of Investigation spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   GBI spokesman John Bankhead said all evidence taken from the
Hilton and ``from other places'' was sent to the GBI's crime lab,
finished as quickly as possible and returned to Atlanta police.
Police have said they are looking at connections between the two
crimes and have said that the guns used in both cases were the same
caliber.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is top priority,'' Bankhead said. We've expedited the
processing of all evidence pertaining to the Atlanta case and also
evidence collected from any other case that might have a connection
to the Atlanta case. That includes ballistics.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerrold Shropshire, 50, of Altamonte Springs, Fla.; Ronald
Gutkowski, 51, of Leesburg, Fla.; and Phillip Dover, 31, of
Gainesville were found shot in the head inside room 2414 on Oct.
18.
</P>
<P>
   Three days earlier, 19-year-old Ladaris Hawkins was found shot
in the face at a Days Inn on Old National Highway in College
Park.All of the victims were in their underwear. Three of the four
victims' wallets and keys were taken and there was no forced entry
in either hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb police spokesman Robert Quigley has also said that they are
working with Atlanta to determine whether a robbery in the
Northwest Atlanta Hilton is related to the Atlanta homicides, but
he declined to give any additional details.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta police refused to say, however, whether the handguns
matched. They also would not say what happened to the Atlanta
Falcons football tickets that the men had planned to use on the
Sunday they were shot, nor would they explain why they cannot
pinpoint what time a hotel surveillance tape was taken.
</P>
<P>
   The police have released two video shots of a man they say is a
possible witness and Atlanta Police Maj. Mickey Lloyd said Thursday
that the second tape released was shot after midnight on the day of
the shooting. The tape released last week, showing the same man
getting on an elevator in the hotel with Dover, was taken at 2:10
a.m., shortly before the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton spokeswoman Jeanne Datz said Dover had bought a sandwich
at the Hotel's Cafe Express, a 24-hour snack bar, before getting
onto the elevator with the stranger. Datz did not know whether the
stranger had purchased anything at the cafe or where in the hotel
the stranger had met Dover, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   Datz said hotel employees are still baffled by the incident.
``They are doing the best job they can and they're holding their
heads up high, but they're very frustrated because none of them can
remember seeing Dover or the stranger. They wish they did because
they want to help the police.''
</P>
<P>
   Datz said the housekeeper who found the three victims has not
been able to return to work since the shootings. ``It's my
understanding she's doing well,'' Datz said. ``We've offered her
counseling and she accepted it. We told her we would do everything
in our power to help her get back on her feet.''

 &HT;    Global economic woes take toll on AGCO
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ AGCO, which reported a sharp drop in third-quarter
profits, said global economic turmoil is forcing the Duluth,
Ga.-based farm equipment maket to cut 1,400 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   AGCO said it expects to record a nonrecurring charge of $35
million to $40 million in the fourth quarter as it reduces its
worldwide workforce by 12 percent. The company employs 11,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry is impacted by the financial crises in Asia and
Russia that have created major surpluses of commodity products and
therefore caused commodity prices to drop, reducing farm income,
which is the driving force behind farm equipment purchases,'' said
Robert J. Ratliff, chairman and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Plummeting grain prices have ended a spending spree by farmers
that helped farm equipment companies post record earnings in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   Robert F. McCarthy, an analyst with ABN AMRO, a Chicago
investment banking firm, forecast ``a very tough going for AGCO for
the next several quarters,'' given the outlook for world
agricultural commodities.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Ratliff said he sees ``no early resolution'' of
those problems this year or next. ``We do hope there will be a
return to the normal market by 2000,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Financial Officer Patrick Shannon said the company now
expects net income to drop by about 50 percent for the year,
excluding non-recurring charges.
</P>
<P>
   Net income for the third quarter ended Sept. 30 was $17.9
million, or 30 cents a share, compared with $47.3 million, or 75
cents a share, excluding non-recurring charges recorded in 1997 of
$4.9 million, or 5 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue was $665.7 million, compared with $759.5 million for the
third quarter a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   AGCO had forewarned on Oct. 7 that its third quarter results
would be weak, so Thursday's per-share results were in line with
analysts' revised expectations of 30 cents a share, as surveyed by
First Call.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said last month it would reduce operating
expenses and cut back production schedules and earlier this month
said 1998 production of tractors and combines would be 13 percent
below last year's levels.
</P>
<P>
   AGCO said the layoffs will be concentrated in its manufacturing
operations in North America, South America and Europe. The cutbacks
will hit all of AGCO's U.S. plants _ in Coldwater, Ohio,
Independence, Mo., and Lockney, Texas. The company has no Georgia
plants.
</P>
<P>
   No plants will close, Ratliff said. But he said there will be
``some terminations'' at AGCO's corporate headquarters at River
Green Parkway and Peachtree Industrial Boulevard in Duluth, which
employs 225 workers. ``I do not have an exact number yet, but
expect it to be minimal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The number will depend on how many employees accept early
retirement offers by year's end, Ratliff said. So far 64 employees
that have been offered early retirement in North America have
accepted, he said, many of them in Duluth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel reasonably comfortable that the actions we're taking
will permit the company to continue in a profitable manner and when
industry demand resumes some growth, we will be positioned to enjoy
that growth,'' Ratliff said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said AGCO is acting now to ``size the company to a
smaller global market.''
</P>
<P>
   AGCO makes tractors, combines and other farm equipment that it
sells through 8,500 independent dealers in 140 countries under such
brands names as Allis, Massey Ferguson, Glencoe and Willmar.
</P>
<P>
   Ratliff said AGCO's bright spots are Germany, where the company
aquired the Fendt tractor company in 1997, and that he is
``cautiously optimistic'' about South America, if further
International Monetary Fund assistance boosts recovery for a key
AGCO market.
</P>
<P>
   AGCO said North American third quarter sales declined 2 percent,
on a unit basis, with a decrease of about 20 percent during
September alone. Western European sales were off 11 percent and
South America was down 6 percent. There was a 28 percent in other
parts of the world, where AGCO's presence is minimal.
</P>
<P>
   AGCO said it expects North American industry sales to drop 15 to
20 percent next year from 1998 levels, Western Europe and South
America to decline 5-10 percent and the rest of the world to be
flat or down 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For the nine months, AGCO's net income was $82.9 million, or
$1.35 a share, compared with $129 million, or $2.09 a share,
excluding non-recurring charges. Revenue was $2.18 billion,
compared with $2.34 billion.
</P>
<P>
   AGCO's shares have fallen further than those of its two bigger
rivals, Deere and Case. One reason is both also have strong
construction equipment divisions. And Deere is putting considerable
resources into
</P>
<P>
   building up its consumer products division.
</P>
<P>
   Still, all of the major farm equipment makers' stock is down
considerably: AGCO is down 68 percent year-to-date; Case is down 64
percent; New Holland is down 51 percent; and Deere is down 39
percent.

 &HT;    Genuine Parts shops for growth, acquisition
 &HT;    By Robert Luke
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Genuine Parts _ seeking a return to double-digit sales
and earnings growth _ Thursday announced yet another in a string of
acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   More are on the way in all four of its distribution businesses,
said Jerry Nix, senior vice president of finance.
</P>
<P>
   Genuine Parts, with annual sales of more than $6 billion, said
it agreed in principle to acquire Atlanta-based Johnson Industries,
a privately held distributor of auto supplies with annual revenue
of $120 million and 350 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson Industries serves new-car dealers and owners of large
fleets, such as Federal Express.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly hope to have at least one more acquisition
between now and the end of the year,'' Nix said. It probably will
be in the auto parts distribution business. But it will be larger,
said Nix, who declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase of Johnson Industries, expected to be completed by
Dec. 31, will boost earnings by a penny to 2 cents a share in 1999,
Nix estimated.
</P>
<P>
   ``In effect, we are buying market share,'' Nix said. ``We also
think we can improve their position and better penetrate the
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Genuine Parts plans to pay $25 million to $50 million in cash
and stock for Johnson Industries. A portion of the purchase price
will be paid at closing. The rest will be determined by whether the
acquired company meets earnings targets in 1999 and 2000, Nix said.
</P>
<P>
   Genuine Parts' growth has slowed lately. Already a distributor
of auto and industrial parts and office products, it acquired a
distributor of electrical and electronic components earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to get back to double-digit sales and profit
growth,'' Nix said. ``These are strategic moves to allow us to get
back to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Best known for its NAPA Auto Parts stores, Genuine Parts last
posted double-digit growth in 1994, when profits rose 12 percent
from a year earlier on an 11 percent increase in sales.
</P>
<P>
   In trading Thursday, Genuine Parts' shares slipped 12 1/2 cents
to $30.68 3/4.

SAVE SOCIAL SECURITY? FROM WHAT? 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Nov. 1) 
(af) 
 By FRED BROCK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the new Congress convenes early next year, one of the major
issues it will tackle _ after it tears itself away from Bill and
Monica _ will be Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   We may end up wishing that it had stuck with Bill and Monica.
So-called reform of the Social Security system is looking more and
more like a solution in search of a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians talk crisis and issue dire warnings about the
graying of America and the threat of generational warfare.
Journalists toss off phrases like ``looming insolvency.'' There is
little wonder that a survey this year showed that 68 percent of
Americans think that ``fixing'' Social Security is very important.
</P>
<P>
   But even under the most gloomy economic growth forecast, the
system is rock-solid for the next 30 years or so _ and, with some
minimal changes, for 40 years after that.
</P>
<P>
   Even if economic growth over the next 75 years slows to half the
annual average of 3.5 percent over the past 75 years, the Social
Security system will do just fine, in the view of Mark Weisbrot,
research director of the Preamble Center, a nonpartisan Washington
policy institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing we could do to protect Social
Security right now is to leave it alone,'' said Weisbrot, co-author
of ``Social Security: The Phony Crisis,'' scheduled to be published
next year by the University of Chicago Press.
</P>
<P>
   So why all the fuss? Think hidden agendas. On all sides.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street would love to get its hands on at least some of the
billions of dollars in the Social Security trust fund. And many
ultra-conservative Republicans want to privatize the system fully.
</P>
<P>
   But knowing that the idea won't fly politically, they are
pushing for partial privatization, in which individuals would
invest a portion of their contributions in the stock market, all in
the name of rescuing the system.
</P>
<P>
   The concept has picked up support across the political spectrum.
Several variations are under consideration, including one modeled
after individual retirement accounts; it would give Americans broad
discretion over how they invested their money.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market, however, has been reminding people lately that
it can go down as well as up. And Weisbrot pointed out that the
declines can be long-term: between 1968 and 1978, for example, the
market lost 45 percent of its value.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the next Congress is almost certain to consider
partial privatization. But when it does, it should also consider
safeguards to protect novice investors from dangers like account
churning by commission-driven brokers.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has been exhorting Congress to use the budget
surplus to ``save'' Social Security. He has thus scored political
points for the Democrats as the great protectors of Social
Security. But Republicans aren't about to cry foul and say the
system doesn't need saving. If they do, there goes their argument
for privatization.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a kind of gentlemen's agreement here in Washington,
I'm afraid, not to point out the basic fact that we don't really
need to be talking about Social Security,'' Weisbrot said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest smoke screens in the debate is the idea that
the Social Security ``crisis'' will cause generational conflicts.
The argument conjures up images of old people with canes and
walkers, barricaded in retirement villages, fighting off hordes of
Generation-X'ers.
</P>
<P>
   But as Knight A. Kiplinger writes in ``World Boom Ahead''
(Kiplinger Books), the graying of America will be very gradual. It
may be true that by 2020, about 53 million people, or 16 percent of
the population, will be over 65, compared with the current 35
million, or 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Kiplinger says that isn't the whole picture. Because of
general population growth, the number of young people will be
growing, too, and the the nation's median age in 2020 will be equal
to the median age of Florida's population today: 38. The current
national median is 35. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Generation-X'ers didn't spring full-grown from the
mind of Tommy Hilfiger. They have parents and grandparents, too,
and they want them to have a secure retirement. And Generation X
will eventually retire. A poll of 18- to 34-year-olds last summer
by the 2030 Center, which studies economic issues affecting young
people, showed broad support for the future of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   So here's a modest proposal. Since whatever problems Social
Security may have are a very long way off, let's have a 10-year
test of privatization _ with congressional pensions.
</P>
<P>
   Let Congress pass a law linking representatives' and senators'
pensions to the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index. And maybe when
Congress debates health care, it should force its members into
HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Both moves would, to borrow from Dr. Samuel Johnson, an 18th
century literary figure, focus their minds wonderfully.

 &HT;    Deal with AT&AMP;T ignites shares of Norcross firm
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investors eagerly embraced Antec Corp. on Thursday, propelling
shares of the Norcross company up 43 percent after the announcement
of a major deal with AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   News of the pact _ potentially worth $900 million _ sent Antec
stock up $5.25 to close at $17.375 as nearly 5 million shares
changed hands, more than 13 times its normal volume.
</P>
<P>
   Initially worth $50 million, the deal calls for AT&AMP;T to buy
equipment that allows upgraded cable television lines to carry
phone conversations to 2 million homes. The equipment will come
from Antec and Suwanee-based Arris Interactive, which is jointly
owned by Antec and Nortel, a $1.5 billion-a-year, Canadian-based
telecommunications company.
</P>
<P>
   The AT&AMP;T deal calls for the equipment to be connected in up to 2
million homes by Tele-Communications Inc., the huge cable company
recently purchased by AT&AMP;T. But if the business goes well _ if
consumers are hungry to have an alternative to their local phone
company _ then AT&AMP;T has an option to buy more equipment.
</P>
<P>
   That arrangement _ and the next few years _ will test the notion
that cable companies can compete profitably by providing telephone,
computer and television service. Betting that they can, AT&AMP;T is
plunking down $46 billion to purchase TCI.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, once the owner of virtually all the phone lines in
America, shed local service in its 1984 breakup and prospered
selling long-distance. But with deregulation in the mid-1990s,
competition was permitted in all markets and AT&AMP;T was bedeviled by
its lack of local lines. After abandoning efforts to build its own
network or resell someone else's service, AT&AMP;T is gambling that
cable can be its connection.
</P>
<P>
   But also tied to that success is the fate of Antec _ where
expectations are high and executives elated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we are way out ahead right now,'' said John Egan,
Antec chairman and chief executive. ``This is a business whose time
has come.''
</P>
<P>
   Two-way cable lines pass by about 20 percent of U.S. homes,
according to Paul Kagan Associates, a research and consulting firm.
Anticipation about further growth is fueled by the entry of AT&AMP;T,
one of the world's best-known brand names, into that cable market.
Adding to the potential impact, AT&AMP;T is forging deals with other
cable companies that would give it access to 60 percent of U.S.
homes, according to Kagan.
</P>
<P>
   And growth in cable should mean business for Antec.
</P>
<P>
   Egan compared the entry of cable companies into phone markets to
the first forays of MCI into the long-distance market, once an AT&AMP;T
fiefdom. ``The sky is the limit as to how large this can get over
the next several years.''
</P>
<P>
   Antec has kept a relatively low profile, despite reaching more
than $529 million in revenue during the past year. The company
moved its headquarters from suburban Chicago to Norcross in July.
About 300 of its 2,800 employees are here.
</P>
<P>
   Antec was founded as a distributor 41 years ago. Only in recent
years did it began developing the technology. Antec went public in
1993, and become a key player making the equipment for cable
companies.
</P>
<P>
   TCI owns 21 percent of Antec and has bought its equipment
before.
</P>
<P>
   Antec has also made deals to sell equipment to Time Warner and
Cablevision. Before AT&AMP;T, its largest customer was Cox
Communications, which is majority-owned by the company that owns
the Journal-Constitution. Antec also has international business
that includes Argentina, Austria, Japan and China.
</P>
<P>
   Antec's competitors include much-larger neighbor
Scientific-Atlanta. However, Antec's product line does not include
satellite and cable modems.
</P>
<P>
   The Antec Corp. arrangement with Arris Interactive calls for
Arris, which has 200 employees, to provide research and
development. Antec's role is to sell the equipment in the United
States, while Nortel is mostly responsible for overseas sales.
</P>
<P>
   Antec's technology uses what are known as hybrid fiber-coaxial
lines that can carry voice, data and video.
</P>
<P>
   The company's equipment can let a cable company compete for
local phone service _ even if the customer isn't buying cable
service.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Antec says the technology will let a cable company add
lines to a home electronically, an advantage over phone companies
that must send technicians to install new lines.
</P>
<P>
   Egan said the biggest obstacle to Antec's success could come
from a slowdown in cable company upgrades of their older cable _
which can only transmit signals to the home _ to the new, which can
carry signals in both directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``How you make it, how you build it, how you install it,'' Egan
said. ``These are not technical challenges. These are logistical
and operational challenges.

U.S. APPROVES DRUG TO HELP PREVENT BREAST CANCER IN WOMEN AT RISK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The government approved use of the drug tamoxifen
Thursday to help prevent or delay the development of breast cancer
in healthy women who have a very high risk of getting the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturer, Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, said it would
distribute computer disks, developed with the National Cancer
Institute, to doctors to help them assign precise scores on a risk
table to individual women. The scores would then be used to help a
doctor and patient decide whether to prescribe the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Zeneca said it would immediately start promoting the drug among
doctors and then conduct a large advertising campaign aimed
directly at women early next year. The company said it would run
advertisements in widely circulated magazines and newspapers and
might run commercials on television and radio as well.
</P>
<P>
   The computer disk includes a series of questions to assess a
woman's risk of developing breast cancer. Older women, women with a
family history of breast cancer, women first menstruated before the
age of 12 and women who first became pregnant after the age of 30
are at increased risk, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   For women with one or more of these factors, doctors may
conclude that the benefits of tamoxifen outweigh the possible side
effects, which include blood clots in the lungs or major veins and
cancer of the lining of the uterus, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The medication has been used for more than 20 years to treat
breast cancer. But Thursday the Food and Drug Administration
approved a new use, to reduce the incidence of breast cancer.
Federal officials said it was apparently the first anti-cancer drug
to be approved for people who do not have the disease.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Studies by the National Cancer Institute found that for women at
high risk of getting breast cancer tamoxifen reduced the chances of
getting it by 44 percent, though it does not eliminate the risk,
and the long-term effects of taking the drug are not yet known.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Friedman, the acting commissioner of food and drugs,
said, ``FDA strongly advises women and their doctors to carefully
weigh the benefits and risks of tamoxifen before patients use the
drug.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeneca declined to estimate the size of the prospective new
market for tamoxifen. But Mary Lynn Carver, a spokeswoman for the
company, said that ``29 million women are at increased risk for
breast cancer and should discuss their risk with their doctors and
determine if tamoxifen therapy is appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   The drug costs $80 to $100 a month, Ms. Carver said. The
recommended course of therapy lasts five years, but the protective
effects appear to last five years after a woman stops taking the
drug, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Zeneca sells tamoxifen under the name Nolvadex. The company,
based in Wilmington, Del., is a subsidiary of Zeneca Group PLC, an
$8.6 billion bioscience company based in London.
</P>
<P>
   A business analyst who follows the pharmaceutical industry said
he estimates that sales will increase 20 to 30 percent. ``The
safety profile is not perfect for a product that would be used on a
large patient base or for a long time,'' said the analyst, Sergio
Traversa, of Mehta Partners. Ms. Carver, the Zeneca spokeswoman,
said that sales of tamoxifen in the United States totaled $320
million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Eli Lilly &AMP; Co. is also aiming at the breast-cancer prevention
market and Traversa noted that the company is studying the
anti-cancer properties of its drug Evista, which seems to have
fewer side effects.
</P>
<P>
   The computer disk Zeneca will distribute to doctors calculates a
score for each patient, based on the woman's answers to various
questions. Zeneca says a woman with a score of 1.67 or greater
should talk to her doctor about her breast-cancer risk and the use
of tamoxifen.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carver gave these hypothetical examples of how the
risk-assessment system works:
</P>
<P>
   _ A 45-year-old Hispanic woman, who had her first menstrual
period at the age of 12 and and her first child at the age of 38.
Her mother died of breast cancer, and her sister is being treated
for the disease. The woman has a risk score of 2.4 and should
therefore consider taking the drug.
</P>
<P>
   _ A 40-year-old white woman, who had her first menstrual period
at the age of 12 and has not had any children. Her mother and
sister have had breast cancer, and a breast biopsy found that the
woman had abnormal non-cancerous cells. The woman has a risk score
of 5.9 and should therefore discuss the possibility of taking
tamoxifen with her doctor.
</P>
<P>
   _ A 35-year-old black woman, who was 15 when she had her first
menstrual period and was 20 when she had her first child. No close
relatives have had breast cancer. She herself has had two breast
biopsies that found abnormal non-cancerous cells. Her score is 1.1,
so she is not a candidate to use the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Pearson, executive director of the National Women's
Health Network, a women's health advocacy group, said healthy women
should be cautious about using the drug approved Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a premature approval,'' she asserted. ``There's no way
to know yet whether tamoxifen can truly prevent breast cancer or
merely delay it.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ms. Pearson said she worried that heavy advertising
could lead to overuse of the drug. Women, she said, may
underestimate the danger of ``serious, even fatal complications.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists do not know exactly how tamoxifen works, but they
have a good idea of one possible mechanism. Estrogen, a hormone, is
believed to stimulate the growth of cancer cells, and tamoxifen is
believed to block the action of natural estrogens in breast tissue,
thus inhibiting the growth of breast cancer cells.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials and Zeneca executives sounded a similar note
in describing the significance of Thursday's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said,
``Today's action provides an important new option for some women at
heightened risk of breast cancer,'' the second leading cause of
cancer death among American women.
</P>
<P>
   Zeneca Pharmaceuticals president Robert Black said: ``For the
millions of women who are at high risk of developing breast cancer,
there is now something they can do to reduce the risk of developing
the disease. It's a new option, a choice, that many women will have
available to them as they discuss their health with their
doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinical trials of tamoxifen were halted 14 months early, in
March of this year, after scientists found that the drug sharply
reduced the incidence of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman of the FDA said that the risk of uterine cancer for
women taking tamoxifen was about three times the risk for women in
the general population not taking it. Zeneca said that such cancer
occurred in 20 to 30 women among every 10,000 treated with
tamoxifen in a year. By contrast, it said, current data indicate
that there are 7 cases of such cancer each year for every 10,000
healthy women in the general population.
</P>
<P>
   The large-scale test of tamoxifen involved 13,388 women at
high-risk of breast cancer. Half took the drug and 85 of them
developed breast cancer; half took a placebo and 154 of them
developed breast cancer.

COLBERT RETURNS HEALTHY
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This time, Jim Colbert comes back as a double
survivor.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen months ago, he was ``staring down the elephant,''
wondering if surgery would be enough to stem the prostate cancer
that had been suddenly, frighteningly discovered during a routine
checkup.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, in the Transamerica Championship at Napa, Colbert
was back in the winner's circle on the Senior PGA Tour, completing
a comeback that had earned the two-time money leader everything
significant to him except a victory during the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Colbert, 57, enters today's Pacific Bell Senior Classic
(formerly Ralphs Senior Classic) at Wilshire Country Club ranked
seventh in 1998 tour earnings with $1,066,541. He is content with
his game, his health and what he now sees as his mission: to preach
the wisdom and necessity of regular checkups for prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to catch it early,'' Colbert said, ``because then
they can deal with it effectively. If you get it in the later
stages, you have to deal with it the rest of your life.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a message he shares spreading with fellow prostate-cancer
survivor Arnold Palmer, who also will play at Wilshire this week
and preceded Colbert's traumatic experience by nearly six months in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arnold is the one who openly came out and spoke about prostate
cancer and really has been instrumental in bringing the subject out
of the closet,'' Colbert said.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Tour player Bob Murphy credits Colbert and Palmer not
just for their awareness efforts but for helping raise
prostate-cancer research funding through a program matching
donations to birdies by tour players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something needed to be done,'' Murphy said Wednesday at
Wilshire. ``They've raised a lot of money for cancer but not
prostate cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Colbert can be a relentless opponent on the golf course _ he
chased down current senior standard-setter Hale Irwin in the
stretch runs of successive seasons to snatch Player of the Year
honors from Irwin in 1995 and again in '96.
</P>
<P>
   But Colbert is equally serious in his pitch for awareness of a
disease that claimed 40,000 lives last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're 40 and over and a male,'' he said. ``get that PSA
(prostate-specific antigen) test. It's just a little blood out of
your arm. It can save your life.''
</P>
<P>
   As passionate as Colbert is in support of prostate-cancer
awareness, the one-time Kansas State football player remains
passionate about golf, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kick is to play well as long as you can,'' said Colbert,
who has 19 victories and $8.1 million in career earnings on the
senior tour after earning $1.5 million and winning eight times on
the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   He seems to have a knack for playing well at Wilshire, where Gil
Morgan is the two-time defending tournament champion but where
Colbert as easily could be bidding for a fourth consecutive title
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Colbert finished second by a stroke in '95 and '96 at Wilshire
during his successful runs that overtook Irwin, then led the
tournament by three strokes last year _ four months after his
cancer surgery _ only to tire in the final round and fade to finish
fifth, seven strokes back.
</P>
<P>
   He had the fire if not the finish in those years, but with all
he's been through in the past 16 months, have Colbert's goals and
priorities changed?
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm supposed to say yes,'' he said. ``But the answer is
no. I've always liked being a golf pro. If I ever want to change
anything, I just want to be a little better.''
</P>

AS ANTI-CLINTON AD CAMPAIGN EXPANDS, DEMOCRATS AIR REBUTTALS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hardly retreating from their attack on President
Clinton's moral behavior, the Republicans have prepared a fourth
anti-Clinton campaign commercial, the toughest yet, that presents
his turnabout apology to the nation last summer as ``legal mumbo
jumbo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember when he looked us in the eye?'' asks the commercial,
tailored to get out the anti-Clinton vote in selected Southern
Republican districts.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Democrats, insisting they can capitalize
on any Republican broadcast blitz, unveiled rebuttal commercials
including a radio ad that begins with the Republicans' tag line
about the president's sex-and-mendacity scandal: ``What did you
tell your kids?''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic ad has one actress playing a mother asking that
question and another instantly responding with a shift of the
subject to education: ``What do you say when they ask why they go
to school in temporary trailers?'' Similar questions about Social
Security and health care follow with the conclusion that
Republicans are more ``obsessed with getting rid of the president''
than serving their constituents.
</P>
<P>
   The clash of commercials over the president's threatened
impeachment is something of a shadow boxing contest since the two
parties, while garnering drumbeat media attention with them here in
the campaign homestretch, are not offering precise details on how
heavy an investment these messages will actually receive beyond the
Beltway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Upwards of a million dollars,'' estimated Democratic National
Committee chairman Steve Grossman, saying he was still trying to
raise that amount Thursday to put the new ads on the air before the
Tuesday election. The Republicans have declined to say how big a
part the scandal ads are playing in their ongoing $10-million drive
to retain control of the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats unveiled two TV commercials at a press conference
that rang with denunciations of their favorite target in past
attack ads, Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich. The commercials
invoke such bread-and-butter issues as Social Security with the
narration concluding: ``Republicans _ so intent on attacking the
president they've forgotten about us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, who have the larger war chest, insist that the
Democrats barely have money for a token TV response and that, in
any case, the most fruitful television air time before Election Day
is already booked. House Democratic Minority Leader Dick Gephardt
was on the phone Thursday soliciting funds to mount the rebuttal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tells you what they're really up to when they have to close
this election with the agenda of Ken Starr,'' said Gephardt at the
Democrats' satellite news conference, aiming in particular at
Starr, the independent counsel who has recommended impeachment of
the president.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt and Grossman accused the Republicans of a desperate
gambit in the scandal ads, one of which questions whether voters
should ``reward'' the president on Election Day.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another replays Clinton's finger-wagging denial of sexual
misconduct in the Oval Office, seven months before he reversed
himself.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Republican ad features the president's admission in
August that he misled the nation but still should be judged
``legally correct'' in his denial under civil court oath of a
sexual affair. The Republican ad also underlines praise from
Grossman for Clinton's ``moral leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not us saying this, it's them,'' emphasized Mary
Crawford, communications director of the National Republican
Congressional Committee. The ad is pegged to the argument that a
Republican majority continues to be needed in Congress as a check
on the president. ``Without the balance Republicans provide just
where would Bill Clinton and Democrats take us?'' the ad asks.
</P>
<P>
   The new Democratic ads respond: ``Will 1999 be a year of
investigation or a year of progress?'' At the unveiling, Grossman
accused the Republicans of presiding over a ``legislative killing
field'' for the past year, then putting ``their real cards on the
table'' with the scandal ads. ``The agenda of the American people
has been held hostage by the Republicans' investigative strategy,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another set of last-minute campaign ads was released by People
for the American Way, a pro-Democratic independent group. ``Yes,
the president let us down,'' one ad concedes, stressing, ``Now it's
time to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   The new ads are notable for repeatedly presenting Starr, the
independent counsel, as the problem. ``Are they gonna listen to us
or Ken Starr?'' asks an actress portraying a mother. Another ad,
entitled ``Had Enough,'' urges voters: ``Don't stay home. Send Ken
Starr home.''

COMMENTARY: MORE MIDEAST MYTHS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By A.M. ROSENTHAL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The three major products of the Mideast are Arab oil, Israeli
technology and political myths cooked up by both sides _ some
entirely homemade, others a compote of foreign and domestic
ingredients.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They travel well. One appeared in the New York senatorial
campaign _ the one about how the Gulf war was useless for the
United States and should not have been fought. The other is new _
Benjamin Netanyahu reversed himself at Wye and got nothing worth
having. It is selling in America and Israel.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 12, 1991, Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., voted ``no'' to
authorizing American force against Saddam Hussein. On Oct. 18,
1998, Schumer, running for senator, said that the Bush
administration had had no clear plan on how to deal with Saddam and
that since Iraq was still menacing the United States ``had proved''
his vote correct. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Schumer had not concentrated on Bush planning failures
but on protesting that sending troops would end chances of a
peaceful diplomatic settlement with Saddam. Of everything said in
the D'Amato-Schumer campaign, Schumer's voting rationale interests
me most _ for present and future significance.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The United States threw away fruits of victory, but if it had
not first defeated Iraq by military force, Saddam would years ago
have taught Schumer what menace meant.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Iraq would have thousands more biological and chemical weapons,
plus a nuclear-loaded missile arsenal big enough to be a deterrent
against both the United States and what remained of Israel after
Saddam's advertised incineration campaign.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Saddam fights inspection imposed by the war because it has
uncovered much of his concealed stockpiles. He itches to get back
to restocking death against Israel, and parading America as a
slovenly appeaser.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ``useless war'' is not an academic argument. History is
being rewritten at the United Nations right now, aimed at freeing
Saddam from sanctions and effective inspection. I am sure Schumer
had no desire for its company, but he and the Saddam-appeasement
claque say America should not have fought the war that so far has
prevented Iraq from becoming a great power in nuclear, chemical and
biological weaponry. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Washington falters and stalls, but it is still a barrier against
releasing Saddam from restrictions, weakened as they are. If enough
senators believe the war was useless, that barrier will collapse.
Schumer has a few days to explain himself further.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wye: The myth grows that Netanyahu reversed his prime
ministerial promises not to give up any land. Many Americans and
Israelis have been shouting at him so loud that they can't hear
what he says.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He gave up land almost as soon as he took office. He fulfilled
Labor's commitment to give up the revered city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu said he would carry out Labor's written land promises
to the Palestinians, but not its hints and nudges. He said what he
wanted _ a peace that he could tell Israelis was based on as much
security as any peace with Palestinians could offer: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Everything nailed down in writing in advance. A specific
timetable of reciprocity _ so much of the agreed new 13 percent
withdrawal for so much confirmed action against terrorism, racial
filth, Hamas and Islamic Jihad strongholds.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most important,'' said an Israeli official. ``We
told Arafat if there are final negotiations we will give him only 1
percent more. He knows we mean it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Arafat is asking for a total of 95 percent,'' I said. ``You
mean, Israel offers l percent more, for 41 percent, and he
agrees?''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he says, ``or no settlement. Washington agrees that
only we will decide the withdrawal.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this the same agreement that the same U.S. administration
made and broke after Israel turned over Hebron?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he says.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I contain enthusiasm. But I think, Netanyahu is fulfilling his
word to Israelis to consider only a peace plan that would be secure
if Arafat did carry out his promises. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What happens when Arafat dies and fundamentalists take over
Palestine, Jordan and Saudi Arabia?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I hear that they are training to be gentle, democratic
fundamentalists. I'll check it out.

   It being Halloween, let us salute Winnie Judd, trunk murderess.
She died the other day in Phoenix, age 93. The Times obituary laid
her out in grand style, with a full account of her 15 minutes of
grisly fame back in long-ago 1931.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving in Los Angeles by train from Phoenix, she had two
trunks unloaded, one of which, an observant porter told the law,
seemed to be bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   Examination disclosed one trunk packed with the complete body of
a 32-year-old woman; the other, with the body of a 24-year-old
woman ``neatly cut into three pieces,'' the Times obituary
explained, ``to make it easier to pack.''
</P>
<P>
   You can tell this was back in the Stone Age. Americans not only
traveled by train, they also carried heavy luggage with them.
Nowadays Mrs. Judd would ship everything by UPS.
</P>
<P>
   The details of the trial are humdrum. Winnie, as the tabloids
called her, claimed self-defense; the prosecution called it a
cold-blooded act of murderous jealousy.
</P>
<P>
   Convicted, she was sentenced to be hanged, then excused from the
gallows on grounds of insanity. After seven escapes from mental
institutions, she was set free in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody during her trial seems to have been terribly curious
about who had performed the dismembering work, though it was said
to be of professional quality beyond Mrs. Judd's skills.
</P>
<P>
   Crime has declined since Mrs. Judd's day. The murders that
fascinated the tabloids, and much of the nation, during the 1930s
and '40s had a more amateurish, homespun quality than we are now
accustomed to.
</P>
<P>
   Murder nowadays seems like an industrial production as savage as
a corporate downsizing. Killers for international drug cartels wipe
out entire families _ men, women, children _ on orders from above.
</P>
<P>
   Organized mobs use professional hit men who dispose of the
results of their skills by having them ground up in industrial
machinery and used for highway paving.
</P>
<P>
   Modern murders rarely rate more than two days in the news before
being shrugged off by the public. We are stuffed by a steady diet
of murder as both news and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with our industrial-style murderers, killers of the
Prohibition and Depression years were mom-and-pop operators. The
small-scale human messes they made kept the public fascinated.
</P>
<P>
   Their murders were rich with the human-interest angles that are
catnip for the press.
</P>
<P>
   The Lindbergh kidnap-murder case of the 1930s may have been the
century's most absorbing crime story. The country was absorbed in
it from the moment Americans learned that Lindbergh's son had been
stolen to the night Bruno Richard Hauptmann went to the electric
chair.
</P>
<P>
   Hauptmann was the quintessential mom-and-pop criminal, a working
stiff desperate for money. He still has defenders who argue that he
was unfairly convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Histories of the age between the world wars are full of bungled
mom-and-pop murders that made it a golden age for the tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   One of the juicier was the Hall-Mills case of the 1920s. The
dead were a society clergyman and a lady of the choir. The trial
featured a female farmer whose work among barnyard animals led the
tabloids to christen her ``the pig woman.'' The papers kept the
story alive for five years, but no one was ever convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Prohibition violence, industrial-scale murder was so
rare that the entire country was shocked in 1929 when Al Capone's
thugs killed seven of ``Bugs'' Moran's men in a Chicago garage.
</P>
<P>
   It was considered such a prodigiously monstrous act that it
became famous across the country as ``the St. Valentine's Day
Massacre.'' Seven wouldn't be a very impressive score for today's
drug-industry killers.
</P>
<P>
   Winnie Judd's attempt to pull off a double murder seems
ridiculously amateurish today. Americans have no patience with
amateurs anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The day when a weekend athlete put on a cheap pair of U.S. Keds
sneakers and some old corduroy pants to play tennis with a Sears
Roebuck racket are as gone as train travel with trunks.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, the sorriest weekend athlete in the land would rather
die than be less correctly dressed, less expensively equipped with
sport gear than Tiger Woods or Pete Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   Winnie, using her silly trunks instead of state-of-the-art
road-paving machinery, now seems an amateurish embarrassment to
American murder.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ He is not on a nostalgia trip, but sometimes his feet
just take him in that direction. Suddenly Alberto Salazar is at the
south end of Central Park, and there is a right turn just before
Columbus Circle. There was an autumn afternoon in 1982 when Salazar
made a right turn on the dirt, and annihilated a brave Mexican
runner who had been with him for nearly 26 miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a long time ago,'' Salazar said Thursday, still whippet
thin, but no longer running marathons. ``The emotion just isn't
there. Seven or eight years ago, it would get in my blood, just
going there.''
</P>
<P>
   That race in 1982 was the last time an American won the New York
Marathon. It was the epitome of his competitive style, the way he
won four of his first seven marathons. In 1981 he had set a world
record of 2 hours 8 minutes 13 seconds (on a course later found to
be 148 meters short), and in 1982 he was dogged by Rodolfo Gomez of
Mexico, who had the reputation for speed at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two theories about marathons,'' Salazar said
Thursday. ``One is that your best is your best. The other theory is
that what you do affects the other runner.''
</P>
<P>
   He is a proud man, with the blood of Roman, Spanish, Basque and
French soldiers and pioneers. His father took the family out of
Cuba when his old companion, Fidel Castro, swerved too far to the
left. Centuries of adventure caused Alberto to take it personally
when another runner stayed with him too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Gomez would be quicker in the final 200 yards,'' he
said. ``I could not afford to let it come to that. I wanted to test
him, to see if his legs were fresh. I mean, obviously, whose legs
are going to be fresh at the end of a marathon? Perhaps his slow
muscles would be tired, but maybe he had not used up his
fast-twitch muscles.''
</P>
<P>
   As clinically deliberate as a bullfighter, Salazar worked on
Gomez. He made a short run; Gomez ran with him. He slowed down,
Gomez slowed down. He made another short run; Gomez stayed with
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came down Central Park South, and suddenly I was 5-6-7
yards in front of him,'' Salazar recalled. ``I knew he was
softening. I said, `Next time he'll expect me to come back, but I
won't.'''
</P>
<P>
   Salazar said he had the heart of an amateur, ``a purity that
came of necessity. You lived like a starving artist.'' Then Fred
Lebow showed him there was money to be made _ ``a pleasant
surprise, the end of the rainbow,'' he said with a slight nod to
his dead friend.
</P>
<P>
   His dominance was over by the 1984 Summer Games, and no American
runner has ever replaced him. He says the sport has not been
``marketed'' the way team sports are, but he understands, from his
two sons, Tony, 16, and Alex, 14, that baseball and soccer are fun.
The father is laying artificial turf in the family back yard in
Portland, Ore., so the two promising players can practice their
skills, but it galls him that good young athletes will not work
hard at running, do not grasp the primitive joy of outrunning
somebody.
</P>
<P>
   ``Athletes from third-world countries are willing to take
steroids and human-growth hormones because their people are
starving,'' Salazar said. ``I can't say, `I'm not going to do it
even if it would save Grandma's life.' There's no way you can
compete without them. It's worth 45 seconds in the 10-kilometers
and 2 minutes in the marathon. And athletes are getting medical
advice. They do it for a certain number of years, and then they
stop. There is no huge evidence that it's killing people.''
</P>
<P>
   Salazar said he never had to make that compromise, his hard work
and his zeal were enough for his time. He came back in 1993 to win
the 54-mile Comrades race in South Africa, was taking Prozac at the
time ``because I was irritable, not clinically depressed.'' He
insisted the only edge from the drug was ``I wasn't irritable
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Salazar stepped in a hole while training and
set off a one-man epidemic of injuries that required surgery. He is
just now starting to do double-digit miles, and would like to break
the world record for the ultramarathon, but he cannot bring himself
to run a marathon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many expectations,'' he said. ``What would be the sense in
people being disappointed if you finished 15th or 20th?''
</P>
<P>
   A foreigner will win on Sunday, by which time Salazar will be
back in Oregon, but he must come east every year, to do some
business for Nike, and take a jog on that patch of dirt where he
and American marathon running made their last stand.  &QL;

WAGES TURN HOT FOR WORKERS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By SYLVIA NASAR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite signs that the labor market has cooled a bit since
spring, the pay of workers is rising faster than it has in years.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's employment cost index _ a broad gauge of
compensation trends and one of the most closely watched yardsticks
of inflationary pressures _ rose a surprisingly strong 1 percent
this summer, the Labor Department reported Thursday. Though
increases in benefit costs remained subdued, wages and salaries
spurted 1.2 percent in the three months that ended on Sept. 30, the
fastest rate since the summer of 1990, at the end of the long,
strong 1980's economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Wages and salaries have risen 4.3 percent in the last year,
substantially more than the 3.6 gain in the previous year. For
workers, that means some of the best real gains in take-home pay in
years. ``It's a workers' paradise with no inflation and lots of
cheap imports,'' said Ed Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Bank
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Workers in financial services, from bankers to mortgage brokers,
are getting the biggest raises. Thanks partly to the boom in
mortgage refinancing, their pay has shot up 8 percent in the last
year. But the pickup in pay is widespread, especially in the
service sector, in contrast to a year ago when fat Wall Street
bonuses temporarily increased the compensation figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing is a fairly broad-based increase in the rate
of growth of compensation,'' said the commissioner of the Bureau of
Labor Statistics, Katherine Abraham.
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, the good news for workers has not translated
into higher inflation, which has been running between 1 percent and
1.5 percent this year. And it may not, Yardeni and others pointed
out, because wages will not necessarily keep climbing this fast for
long.
</P>
<P>
   By and large, companies have not passed along labor cost
increases by raising prices; instead, they have bolstered
productivity and accepted thinner profit margins. And Yardeni,
among others, predicts that slower growth in coming months may well
ease the pressure on wages.
</P>
<P>
   Investors seemed to share this sanguine view Thursday, shrugging
off the fresh evidence of a pickup in wage inflation and bidding up
the prices of bonds and stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, despite economic crises in Asia and Latin America,
plummeting exports and manufacturing job losses in the United
States, the labor market has not loosened as much as might be
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Help-wanted advertising has slipped, the Conference Board
reported, but it remains strong. In October, more consumers
reported that jobs were harder to find _ 16 percent compared with
4.3 percent in September _ but nearly three times as many said that
jobs were abundant. And initial jobless claims, which had jumped
two weeks in a row, are back down near a 10-year low, the Labor
Department said.
</P>
<P>
   Probably most important, the unemployment rate remains nearly a
full percentage point below the level of three years ago _ 4.6
percent versus 5.5 percent _ when wage and benefit inflation
accelerated.
</P>
<P>
   David Levine, economist at Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co., said:
``It's widely believed that the old link between the unemployment
rate and price inflation has been broken. But the link between
unemployment and wage inflation is still solid.''

APARTHEID PANEL RELEASES FINDINGS THAT CAST WIDE BLAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRETORIA _ For the first time in the history of South Africa, an
official organ of the state has declared that apartheid was a
``crime against humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite heavy opposition from nearly all major political
parties, South Africa's government-appointed Truth and
Reconciliation Commission Thursday released the results of its
inquiry in the nation's violent past, and it found individuals and
organizations on both sides of the apartheid conflict guilty of
gross human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the commission chairman, handed the
final report to President Nelson Mandela in a colorful ceremony
Thursday. Tutu said the report is ``a way, an indispensable way to
healing. We will have looked the beast in the eye. We will have com
to terms with our horrendous past and it will no longer keep us
hostage.''
</P>
<P>
   While it offers few surprises, the release of the document
triggered sharp political debate. In a move that ``devastated''
Tutu hours before the scheduled release, the ruling African
National Congress launched a last-minute attempt in court to block
it.
</P>
<P>
   The bid was made in consultation with Deputy President Thabo
Mbeki, the man tapped to succeed Mandela. It reflected the ANC
objection to findings that it committed gross violations of human
rights in the course of its struggle against the apartheid state.
</P>
<P>
   The attempt ended in embarrassment for the ANC after a Cape Town
judge dismissed by mid-morning its contention that the commission
ignored the ANC's right to air its objections prior to publication
of the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The integrity of the commission has been enhanced by this,''
said Alex Boraine, its deputy chairman, after the ruling. ``It is a
victory for truth. The ANC made a very bad decision. Thabo Mbeki
appeared before the commission for three days and conceded that the
ANC, in the course of the struggle, committed gross human rights
violations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Truth and Reconciliation Commission studied abuses committed
both inside and outside the country by the state and liberation
movements alike during a 34-year period beginning in 1960, when
police killed 69 unarmed people during a protest in the township of
Sharpeville, to 1994, when Mandela was inaugurated president.
</P>
<P>
   After its 2 1/2-year tenure, the TRC has now closed all of its
operations except its amnesty committee, which will continue
hearing applications well into next year.
</P>
<P>
   The panel found former President P. W. Botha responsible for a
wide range of human-rights abuses. It condemned Winnie
Madikizela-Mandela, Nelson Mandela's former wife, for a plethora of
abductions, assaults, and killings committed by youths under her
influence.
</P>
<P>
   It concluded that a ``third force'' _ ``a network of security
and ex-security force operatives'' acted with right-wing elements
and the Inkatha Freedom Party to destabilize the country prior to
the 1994 nationla elections.
</P>
<P>
   Among other findings:
</P>
<P>
   _Senior members of the apartheid government, including the
president, Cabinet members, and police commissioners, foresaw
``that the use of words such as 'take out,' 'wipe out,'
'eradicate,' and 'eliminate' would result in the killing of
political opponents'' and that ``through their use of militant
rhetoric they created a climate where violations of human rights
were possible.''
</P>
<P>
   _The liberation movements, including the ANC, the IFP, and the
Pan Africanist Congress were all guilty of human rights abuses.
``The ANC routinely used torture to extract information and
confession from those being held in camps, particularly in the
period 1979-89.''
</P>
<P>
   _Children and women suffered special abuses at the hands of the
apartheid state. ``Black children and youth were demonized as the
'enemy' by the security forces ... thus facilitating and
legitimating the use of violence and force against them.'' Women in
detention were subjected to ``forms of sexual abuse, threats
against family and children ... and humiliation around biological
functions such as menstruation and childbirth.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission pins responsibility on some prominent people who
have successfully eluded accountability for years. It blames Botha,
the last hard-line apartheid president, and his lieutenants _ such
as Defense Minister Magnus Malan, Law and Order Minister Adriaan
Vlok, and Police Commissioner Johan van der Merwe _ for ordering
and implementing assassinations, massacres in neighboring
countries, and acts of sabotage.
</P>
<P>
   The commission was forced at the last moment, however, to
withhold its conclusions about F. W. de Klerk, the last apartheid
president, who objected to being found ``an accessory after the
fact'' to state-sanctioned bombings of two downtown office
buildings in Johannesburg in the late 1980s. A court will hear the
dispute next March.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Botha, de Klerk nor Mandikizela-Mandela has applied for
amnesty. Evidence amassed by the TRC against anyone who has not
applied for amnesty may be turned over the authorities for possible
criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Many critics of the TRC question the depth of the report. It is
based on testimony from 21,400 victims and amnesty applications
from 7,124 perpetrators seeking indemnity for full disclosure of
their acts. Still, commission members acknowledge that the report
amounts to ``flashlights on the worst issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Lacking both time and resources, the TRC's ability to
investigate fully the period in its mandate was limited. Testimony
from 95 percent of the victims was not properly probed, according
to one member of the investigations unit, but subjected instead to
a loose process of corroboration.
</P>
<P>
   The TRC also made little headway in penetrating the protective
shell of the security forces. The Security Branch of the police,
for example, was comprised of 15 divisions, each then redivided
into as many as 20 smaller units. Yet the commission was only able
to focus on a narrow range of departments within two of the 15
divisions, according to investigator Piers Pigou.
</P>
<P>
   Some 85 percent of the 7,124 amnesty applications came from
prisoners, many of whom were unaware that they were entitled to
legal representation. The amnesty committee members rejected about
5,000 of those applications without hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the TRC was the first truth commission in history to
investigate the roles of elements of a society after a period of
bloodshed. It found widespread complicity during apartheid among
the media, the judiciary, the health-care industry and the
religious community.
</P>
<P>
   But it held no inquiry into the role of parliament and neglected
entire areas of violence such as the ``train killings,'' in which
more than 500 people were murdered in internecine black violence in
the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The commission was also hampered in its investigations by the
deliberate destruction of state documents by the presidential
cabinet, the National Intelligence Service, the Security Branch of
the police, and the Defense Forces _ especially in the early 1990s,
when majority rule finally seemed inevitable. The commission found
cabinet directives issued as late as 1993 ordering such destruction
across all government departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are asking whether we were able to look at each and
every violation, then the answer is no,'' said Dumisa Ntsebiza,
head of the TRC investigations unit. ``But I think we have done the
report and our investigations in such a way that we should draw out
what appear major dominant themes: assassinations, state-ordered
operations, the high level of authorization, institutions,
cross-border raids, and internal abuses.''

<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ John Glenn, an astronaut again at 77,
returned to orbit Thursday in the space shuttle Discovery for a
rendezvous with the memory of a time when exploits of early
astronauts held the world in thrall and for a long-awaited encore
in the role of durable hero as the oldest traveler in outer space.
</P>
<P>
   At 2:19 p.m., after two suspenseful delays, the shuttle's two
rockets and three engines ignited in flames and billowing vapors
and lifted the seven-member crew, including Glenn, the retiring
Democratic senator from Ohio, into an orbit some 345 miles above
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Liftoff of Discovery with a crew of six astronaut heroes and
one American legend,'' intoned Lisa Malone, the countdown
commentator, at the moment the shuttle rose into a cloudless blue
sky.
</P>
<P>
   Although Glenn's flight had been criticized in many quarters as
a publicity stunt and political payoff with little scientific
value, an estimated 250,000 visitors to the Kennedy Space Center
and surrounding communities, one of the biggest crowds to see a
shuttle departure, followed Discovery's ascent, all the way to a
vanishing point of light more than five minutes after liftoff.
President Clinton and Mrs. Clinton watched from the roof of the
Launch Control Center. He was the first incumbent president to see
a space launching here since Richard Nixon watched the takeoff of
Apollo 12 in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on CNN before the liftoff, Clinton pointed out
that this flight _ the last mission before NASA begins launching
the International Space Station _ marked the end of an era. ``So
John Glenn began this first phase of our space program, and he's
ending it just before we start on the space station,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after Discovery reached orbit, Lt. Col. Curtis
Brown, the commander, looked over at Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let the record show, John has a smile on his face and it goes
from ear to ear,'' the colonel said. ``We haven't been able to
remove it yet.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first radio communication with Mission Control, Glenn was
ebullient. ``To do a trite old phrase, zero-G and I feel fine,'' he
said, paraphrasing himself from 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Looking down on the Hawaiian islands, Glenn said: ``Today is
beautiful and great. I just can't even describe it.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 36 years ago, on Feb. 20, 1962, Glenn, then 40,
rocketed aloft here to become the first American to orbit the
planet. Alone, squeezed into a tiny Mercury capsule, he made all of
three orbits of Earth lasting five hours. Now he was riding the
relatively commodious Discovery, with 70 times the room of the
Mercury capsule, on a mission planned to last nine days.
</P>
<P>
   Two younger astronauts, Brown and Lt. Col. Steven Lindsey of the
Air Force, were at the controls. From his passenger seat in the
compartment below the flight deck, Glenn felt the bump at liftoff
and the increasing vibration and noise of the first two minutes of
surging rocket power, 20 times the thrust of the Atlas rocket that
first put him in orbit.
</P>
<P>
   When the two solid-rocket boosters were jettisoned after a
little more than two minutes, he felt a sharper jolt and might have
caught sight of a flash of light in the tiny compartment window.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, it was a more comfortable ascent this time. At
most, the rocket power exerted on Glenn's body was about three
times the normal force of gravity at sea level. This was nothing
crushing, certainly nothing like the ``G'' forces from the Atlas,
which reached eight times normal levels. As the three shuttle
hydrogen engines burned, Glenn could begin to relax to the steady
whirring of turbines and fans.
</P>
<P>
   Eight and a half minutes after ignition, he and the other
Discovery astronauts had reached orbit and, unbuckling their
straps, experienced the floating sensation of weightlessness. On
his Friendship 7 flight in 1962, Glenn never got the chance to
unbuckle and had no place to stretch out. For the rest of the day,
the crew moved slowly about Discovery, opening the cargo-bay doors
and activating the systems and scientific instruments in the
pressurized Spacehab module in the cargo bay where the astronauts
are to conduct many of their medical, biological and
materials-processing experiments during the mission.
</P>
<P>
   Generally overlooked in the avid attention on Glenn is the
multinational crew, including a Japanese and a Spanish astronaut.
The crew is to get busy on Friday with dozens of astronomy
observations, tests of hardware for the Hubble Space Telescope, and
experiments concerning the effects of a low-gravity environment on
living organisms and human physiology.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the scientific work will be handled by Dr. Stephen
Robinson, an engineer; Pedro Duque, an aeronautical engineer who is
representing the European Space Agency, and Dr. Chiaki Mukai, a
Japanese physician and medical researcher. Glenn's primary duty
will be to act as a test subject for investigations of
physiological changes from space flight that appear to parallel
similar changes in aging humans. His attending physician for many
tests will be Dr. Scott Parazynski.
</P>
<P>
   Such studies point up one of the sharpest contrasts between this
flight and Glenn's first. ``Back then, the issue was not successful
experiments but survival,'' Glenn said in a recent magazine
interview. ``Doctors weren't sure whether humans could take eight
G's going up and coming down. As test pilots, our job was to find
out what we could do and couldn't do. Did our eyeballs change
shape? Would inner-ear fluid move differently? Could we even
swallow?''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the Discovery was operating normally, but
engineers said they were investigating the apparent loss of a
small, insulated aluminum panel near the tail. A videotape of the
launching showed the panel dropping off two seconds after
main-engine ignition. The panel appeared to be the cover over a
stowed parachute, which is deployed at landing to slow the shuttle
on the runway.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Donald McMonagle, a shuttle official at
the Kennedy center, said the incident was not expected to pose any
additional risk or cause any change in mission plans. The shuttle
could land without the ``drogue chute,'' which was added to the
shuttles for extra braking force only after more than 50 safe
landings without chutes. And the problem presented ``no hazard to
operations of the vehicle in orbit,'' the official said.

 &HT;    Glenn's return to space is `marvelous,' Mercury astronauts say
 &HT;    By Jeff Bruce
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ He longed for the day he would again
float in the weightlessness of space, and now his dream has come
true.
</P>
<P>
   John Glenn's historic return to orbit not only fulfills a
lifelong ambition for him, it should be a cause for celebration for
all of us. Just ask the men who flew with him, the original Mercury
astronauts, and they'll tell you.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my view, John's return to space has been a marvelous thing
for the country,'' said Scott Carpenter. ``It has been a marvelous
thing for the space program and NASA.''
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter was Glenn's backup when the Ohio native blasted into
space on Feb. 20, 1962, becoming the first American to orbit the
planet. It was Carpenter who uttered those immortal words,
``Godspeed, John Glenn.'' He reprised that benediction just before
Thursday's liftoff:
</P>
<P>
   ``Good luck, have a safe flight, and ... once again, Godspeed,
John Glenn.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitching a ride on Discovery has generated criticism of Glenn
and NASA in some quarters, but Carpenter was unapologetic:
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you try to do something new in any scientific field,
you find naysayers. They are an occupational hazard to people who
want to do forward-looking work.''
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter described Glenn's mission aboard STS 95 as ``an honest
search for new truths in the scientific discipline of human
physiology.''
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter and fellow Mercury astronauts Gordon Cooper and Wally
Schirra were seen often in the days leading up to Glenn's launch.
They hosted a reception and press conference at the Astronaut Hall
of Fame on Wednesday where they unabashedly praised Glenn. And they
offered TV commentary Thursday at the launch site. Carpenter teamed
up with NBC. Cooper, who flew the last Mercury capsule to orbit the
Earth, was on hand for CBS. And Wally Schirra, the quipster of the
original seven, helped out ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Schirra, the only astronaut to fly in the Mercury, Gemini and
Apollo programs, said he has no desire to go back into space. ``I
don't need the flight time _ I've been there, done that.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who wonder why Glenn, at 77, would be placing himself
in harm's way again, Schirra had a ready answer: ``I, too, would do
my utmost to leave that crazy U.S. Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn ended up a senator when his astronaut career was cut short
by President Kennedy. JFK couldn't abide Glenn returning to space
for fear America might lose a hero in a space disaster. Back in
those early days of the space program, the rockets that sent
astronauts into the great beyond were far less reliable than the
Shuttle's.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's dangerous. Is it worth it?
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter cut to the chase:
</P>
<P>
   ``We are expendable in the pursuit of high purpose, and John
feels that way, too. The benefits are worth the risks.''
</P>
<P>
   And, let's face it, it's a dream of a lifetime realized.
</P>
<P>
   Said Cooper of Glenn's return to space: ``He's going to have a
lot more fun this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Carpenter: ``I think this is a great opportunity for the
country to revitalize its interest in the space program. John will
bring back some good new information, so everybody wins from this
flight.''
</P>
<P>
   Including John Glenn, who, Carpenter said, ``is going to have
the time of his life.''

 &HT;    Glenn's hometown fans, friends both excited and proud
 &HT;    By Tom Beyerlein
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW CONCORD, Ohio _ Last month, former Dayton minister Kenneth
Kettlewell slipped a 33rd Degree Masonic ring onto the finger of
his one-time schoolmate, U.S. Senator John Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   That ring may have gone into space with Glenn on Thursday,
Kettlewell said as he watched the televised blastoff of the Space
Shuttle Discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Like people young and old throughout Glenn's hometown,
Kettlewell and his wife, Jean, watched with excitement, pride and
some anxiety as the 77-year-old astronaut once again made history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm typical New Concord,'' said Kettlewell, 73, who attended
New Concord High School _ now John Glenn High _ with Glenn in the
late 1930s and served as pastor of Corinth Presbyterian Church in
Dayton's Belmont neighborhood from 1950-59. ``You meet very few
people who think he shouldn't be doing what he's doing today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why does he do it? I think he does it because he's John Glenn.
I don't think it's ego. It's in his character to want to
contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems like most folks in New Concord feel a sense of kinship
with Glenn whether they've met him or not, but Kettlewell has an
acquaintance with Glenn and his wife, Annie, dating to childhood,
and their paths have crossed several times over the years. Glenn
wrote a paragraph about Kettlewell that appeared on the back cover
of the now retired minister's 1989 book, Your Ethical Compass.
Kettlewell, a dyed-in-the-wool Republican, contributed to Democrat
Glenn's failed 1984 presidential campaign because ``New Concord
blood is thicker than Republican water.''
</P>
<P>
   And like many in this town of 2,000 east of Zanesville,
Kettlewell has followed Glenn's exploits for decades. He drove to
New Concord from his home in Akron to join 50,000 others in
welcoming Glenn home after the historic Friendship 7 flight in
which Glenn became the first American to orbit the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think part of the attraction of John Glenn is the small town
values he represents,'' Kettlewell said. ``Honesty, hard work,
humor, fervent patriotism, love of family _ I think there's a
hunger for that.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said Glenn's example shows that older people can
continue to live vital lives. ``He demonstrates we're called to
live as long as we live.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, students at Glenn's alma mater, Muskingum College,
watched the televised event and the entire student body of 800
crowded into the gym at John Glenn High School to watch the launch
on a giant TV screen. Students cheered as Discovery blasted off,
and again when the booster rockets separated from the spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so great,'' said Tiffany LaFever, an 18-year-old John
Glenn High senior. ``I had goosebumps.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had chills,'' said senior Janet Heil, 17. ``I thought
everybody was going to cry. I'll remember it forever.''

 CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.: official said. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A more detailed analysis of the problem is expected to be made
on Friday, McMonagle said.
</P>
<P>
   The day of Glenn's second launching broke warm and clear, with
no signs of technical trouble on Discovery at Pad 39-B. Before his
first mission, Glenn had to wait out 10 weather or mechanical
postponements between December and Feb. 20 before he finally lifted
off.
</P>
<P>
   The countdown on Thursday proceeded smoothly toward a scheduled
2 p.m. liftoff. At a pause at T-minus-9 minutes, Scott Carpenter,
the astronaut who was Glenn's backup pilot in 1962, had some
parting words echoing his famous farewell to the Mercury flight,
which was ``Godspeed, John Glenn.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the crew, Carpenter said, ``At this point in the
count, it seems appropriate to say to the crew, good luck, have a
safe flight, and to say once again, ``Godspeed, John Glenn.''
</P>
<P>
   But Discovery was not going anywhere yet. Some alarms sounded in
the cockpit and were recorded at Mission Control in Houston. The
countdown was halted while engineers considered possible problems
with pressures in the crew module, and soon established that there
was nothing to fear. Then at T-minus-5 minutes, the count was
interrupted again as one private airplane and then another were
spotted flying into restricted airspace near the Kennedy launching
area.
</P>
<P>
   The liftoff seemed trouble-free, until the examination of video
recordings revealed the piece of metal that seemed to break loose
and hit the nozzle of the shuttle's center engine. Investigators
were trying to find out if it was indeed the parachute panel that
fell off. It is a piece of waffle-shaped aluminum 18 inches wide,
22 inches long and 1.7 inches thick.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important maneuvers of the mission is to come on
the fourth day. The Discovery astronauts plan to release a small
satellite called Spartan for two days of observations of the sun's
corona, or outer atmosphere, and its effects on the space
environment throughout the solar system. The satellite is to be
retrieved before the shuttle returns to Earth. The landing is
scheduled for Nov. 7 here at the Kennedy center.
</P>
<P>
   The mission is the 92nd by a shuttle since the reusable craft
were introduced in 1981. And it is the 121st American flight of
astronauts since John Glenn made history with his first flight.
Shortly after 7 p. m., Glenn passed his old space flight record of
five minutes under five hours, and he had eight days ahead of him
on the return flight he had longed to take ever since February
1962.

AMID TENSION, PANEL ISSUES REPORT ON APARTHEID-ERA CRIMES 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also SAFRICA-TEXT)

<P>
   PRETORIA, South Africa _ Far from being the salve for South
Africa's wounds that some had hoped it would be, the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission's final report on this country's brutal
past was released Thursday in the bitter atmosphere of court
challenges and political bickering.
</P>
<P>
   After more than two years of hearings into apartheid-era
atrocities, the commission was finally able to hand over 3,500
pages of its final report Thursday, but not before a last minute
bid by President Nelson Mandela's party to block its release.
</P>
<P>
   At the solemn ceremony in Pretoria on Thursday, dozens of chairs
were empty, in part because every political party in the country
was boycotting the event, each critical of the commission's
findings.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the apartheid government institutionalized
violence in its fight against racial equality, using security
forces to carry out abductions and killings, both within South
Africa and beyond. The government then systematically covered up
its actions, the report concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The report also criticized almost every group involved in the
liberation struggle, including the now-ruling African National
Congress, which it found was responsible for murder and torture,
including the deaths of innocent civilians in bombings and other
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving the report, Mandela thanked the commission but
offered what was far from a ringing endorsement of its work. He
said he accepted the report ``as it is'' with ``all its
imperfections.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us will have reservations about aspects of what is
contained in these five volumes,'' he said
</P>
<P>
   If Mandela was pained, the chairman of the commission,
Archbishop Desmond Tutu, was clearly outraged at the ANC's
last-minute maneuvering, which was widely seen as an attempt to
intimidate the commission into withholding its findings implicating
the party.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tutu, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his non-violent
resistance to apartheid, found himself in a court battle with the
very people whose cause he had shared, the ANC.
</P>
<P>
   During much of the ceremony, the tension was palpable between
Tutu and Mandela. At the end of the ceremony, however, the two men
_ old friends _ danced together as a chorus began its final hymn.
</P>
<P>
   After the event Tutu acknowledged that he had met with Mandela
just before the ceremony and was feeling ``very low.'' But
afterwards, he said, he felt better. He declined to give any more
details.
</P>
<P>
   The commission was created as a way for this country to come to
grips with its bloody past without resorting to expensive and
politically divisive trials. It was supposed to aid in the healing
process by offering amnesties to those who confessed all and by
setting down for the record a true version of historical events.
</P>
<P>
   The work was supposed to have taken no more than 2 years and
should have ended long ago. There were delays in getting the
commission started and several extension have been needed. The
result is that the commission is finishing its work long after the
euphoria of a peaceful transition has worn thin. Instead, the
report is landing just as the country is gearing up for what
promises to be a vicious and combative election year.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few days, the commission appears to have been caught
in a whirlwind of political maneuvering as leaks about the contents
of the report surfaced and many of those criticized took turns
calling the 17-member panel incompetent and destructive.
</P>
<P>
   Former President F.W. de Klerk went further, taking the
commission to court to challenge a finding that he had been an
accessory after the fact because, the report charged, he knew who
was involved in two bombings in he late 1980s but failed to report
his knowledge to police. De Klerk said he only became aware of the
participation of Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok and Police
Commissioner Johan van de Merwe long after the fact and after the
two men had said they would apply for amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   Facing his challenge, the Truth Commission decided to withhold
its findings about de Klerk until the matter was settled by the
courts. The section in the report that contained the findings on de
Klerk, 62, who shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Mandela in 1993
for his role in South Africa's peaceful transition to a multiracial
democracy, was blacked out.
</P>
<P>
   The report, based on more than 160 hearings, thousands of
statements and amnesty applications and the commission's own
investigations, says that from late 1970s to early 1990s, the white
supremacist government assassinated political opponents and covered
up the killings. The commission named former President P.W. Botha,
who is 82 and who has refused to appear before the commission, as
one of the people accountable for the killings, torture and
abduction that characterized the final years of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   It says that he specifically ordered the bombings of a church
headquarters and a union building in the late 1980s. And taking on
one of the most hotly debated issues in the testimony of former
officials, the report flatly dismissed claims by party members who
said that words like ``eliminate'' and ``neutralize'' were used,
but did not mean murder.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the apartheid state drew no distinction between
those fighting to overthrow it and those who befriended its foes,
adding: ``All were lumped together as one target _ a single
category of persons to be killed.''
</P>
<P>
   It said the state security forces were supported by South
Africa's second-largest black party, the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom
Party, led by Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, whose members targeted
the ANC and its anti-apartheid allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commission finds that a network of security and
ex-security force operatives, often acting in conjunction with
right-wing elements and/or sections of Inkatha, fomented,
initiated, facilitated and engaged in violence which resulted in
gross violations of human rights, including random and targeted
killings.''
</P>
<P>
   The report concludes that the apartheid state waged its battle
against democracy inside and outside South Africa, abducting
opponents from neighboring countries, killing rivals abroad and
mounting major military operations across South African borders.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the report also took the ANC to task on several issues. It
found the party was morally and politically responsible for
killings of civilians during military operations, for killings and
maimings in its landmine campaign and for the murders of suspected
informers. It also found the party accountable for the killing of
76 members of the Inkatha Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
   The report was particularly critical of Mandela's former wife,
Winnie Madizikela-Mandela, finding that she and her bodyguards had
participated in or were responsible for numerous assaults and
murders. The report blames the ANC for failing to do anything to
stop her reign of terror in Soweto in the late 1980s, when she was
one of the ANC's most visible members.
</P>
<P>
   Commission officials said they were taken aback by the ANC's
virulent attacks on their findings because, they said, they were no
different than what ANC representatives had acknowledged during
their own testimony to the commission last year.
</P>
<P>
   The ANC announced late Wednesday that it would go to court early
Thursday to block the release of the Commission's report because,
officials claimed, they had not been given a chance to respond.
Commission officials said the ANC had been given three chances
since August to respond, but had missed every deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Awaiting the court's verdict, Tutu seemed beside himself over
the ANC's actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am devastated that we are now unable to go ahead with the
handover of the report,'' he told reporters who had gathered at 6
a.m. to receive early copies. ``I did not struggle against tyranny
just to see it replaced by another tyranny. I will fight against
tyranny with every fiber of my being.''
</P>
<P>
   By late morning a Cape Town judge had ruled against the ANC and
the ceremony went ahead. Tutu and Mandela met minutes before the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   In his own statement, Tutu urged South Africans to accept the
report. ``Some have sought to discredit it preemptively,'' he said.
``Even if they were to succeed, what is that to the point? It won't
change the fact that they killed Stanza Bobape, they bombed Khotso
House, they tortured their own people in their camps in Tanzania,
in Angola, they necklaced people,'' referring to a form of
execution involving rubber tires set ablaze.

   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ They both came to witness John Glenn's
launch into a brilliant Florida sky _ the former U.S. senator who
knows exactly what space travel is like, and the woman aviator who
says she would give her life to experience it.
</P>
<P>
   Jake Garn of Utah was a passenger on a shuttle flight in April
1985 during that brief window before the Challenger accident when
NASA was flying civilians.
</P>
<P>
   It was a joyful experience for Garn, despite a nasty bout of
space sickness, and he clearly loves talking about it.
</P>
<P>
   Jerrie Cobb, on the other hand, has spent the last 35 years
mourning a lost opportunity for space flight.
</P>
<P>
   She was one of 13 women pilots who underwent the same testing
and training given the original Mercury Seven astronauts. But the
13 were ultimately rejected for spaceflight because they were not
military test pilots _ a career off limits to women in those days.
</P>
<P>
   Garn, 67, jokes about asking for another flight when he heard
Glenn was going up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called (NASA administrator) Dan Goldin and told him I wanted
to go back because I have all that baseline data. He said, `You're
not old enough, Jake.' ``
</P>
<P>
   But Cobb, also 67, isn't joking when she says it's her turn,
now. She has a lot of people on her side, including first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton and former Apollo astronaut Buzz Aldrin.
</P>
<P>
   She wrangled a meeting with Goldin, but she says he told her
they have plenty of astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that disappointment, she seemed just as excited about
Glenn's launch as Garn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was here when he first went up,'' Cobb said. ``I'm not
bitter or anything. I'm glad John's getting to go again. I'd feel
the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Safe flight, go with God,'' she said, as though Glenn could
hear her.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio senator's return to space drew scores of celebrities to
the Kennedy Space Center _ actors like Tom Hanks and Leonardo
DiCaprio, baseball great Ted Williams, who flew with Glenn in
Korea, and recording artists Jimmy Buffett and Garth Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton headed an impressive political contingent that
included dozens of members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Glenn's family and the astronaut corps, including the
three other surviving Mercury men, who were most in demand.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's wife, Annie, their children and grandchildren all were
at KSC to watch the launch. Back in 1962, Annie and the children
watched Glenn's first launch on television. She called Thursday's
liftoff ``wonderful'' and planned to fly to Houston Friday to wait
out the rest of the mission.
</P>
<P>
   The hoopla and huge crush of media at the Kennedy Space Center
only served to confirm Mercury astronaut Wally Schirra's suspicions
that NASA arranged Glenn's flight strictly for public relations
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it obvious?'' Schirra asked. ``With all these people, it
isn't science they're interested in.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Noriega, who is scheduled to fly a mission in December
1999, thinks that's just fine. If Glenn generates extra publicity
then maybe people will get a good look at what NASA really does, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And besides, Noriega clearly has a case of hero worship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unbelievable feeling,'' Noriega said. ``I was three
years old when he launched the first time. He's a hero to me. Now,
he's John. His office is down the hall from me.''
</P>
<P>
   Garn wasn't any less exuberant ``I can remember when he was
first selected how jealous I was of the original seven
astronauts,'' Garn said. ``He's one of my heroes, and he and I were
literally sworn in to the Senate side by side.''
</P>
<P>
   Garn recalled that after his own flight in 1985, he returned to
the Senate in time for an important vote and got a special greeting
from Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``John came down from the well and gave me a big bear hug,''
Garn said. ``What people didn't hear was, he said, ``You son of a
gun, you got 109 orbits and I only got three.''
</P>
<P>
   He also took some of the same criticism Glenn has received since
being selected for this flight _ charges that it was no more than a
joy ride, and others were more deserving.
</P>
<P>
   He last talked to Glenn a few months ago, Garn said, but he did
offer one suggestion: ``The only advice I had was ... John, relax
and enjoy the view,'' Garn said.
</P>
<P>
   Garn said he had no qualms about the 77-year-old Glenn making
the flight, noting that the pull of gravity during liftoff was much
less severe than that experienced by a pilot flying an F-16.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the concern about John's age ... it's a very comfortable
environment,'' Garn said of the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Astronaut Winston Scott, who has flown two missions and is
scheduled for a third, said he doesn't presume a longer career with
NASA because of Glenn's flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we can look at John Glenn's flight and glean
that we're all cleared to fly into our late 70s,'' he laughed.
``But it's not a surprise to any of us that a 77-year-old can
function up there. He'll do fine.'' &QL;

   BOSTON _ Time flies. Remember you must die.
</P>
<P>
   It's a long way from being told to have a nice day, but those
words are carved in stone, a few steps from busy Tremont Street.
</P>
<P>
   The phrases are actually in Latin (``Fugit hora, memento
mori''), but their meaning is vividly clear by what appears beneath
them, a carving of Father Time with an hourglass and a skeleton
with an arrow, both reaching to snuff out a candle.
</P>
<P>
   The scene turns up a few times on the gravestones in King's
Chapel Burying Ground, Boston's oldest graveyard, which I recently
visited on a tour of historic graveyards in and around Boston.
</P>
<P>
   That may seem a spooky way to pass the time. But one can just as
easily argue that such places offer as rich an opportunity to
connect with the past as do famous houses or battlefields.
</P>
<P>
   As the scene at King's Chapel indicates, old graveyards can be
remarkable artistically, full of the cultural symbolism of an
earlier era, like the winged skulls on so many colonial headstones
or the delicately etched urns and weeping willows popular in the
early 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Gravestones have been the subject of academic treatises and even
guidebooks. Many years ago, on a whim, I picked up a small
paperback, ``New England Cemeteries,'' by Andrew Kull, which lists
scores of older graveyards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that if people take the time to look, they'll be
amazed what they can discover in a burying ground,'' said Laurel K.
Gabel, research coordinator for the Association for Gravestone
Studies, a nonprofit, membership organization that publishes a
scholarly journal on gravestones.
</P>
<P>
   She compared old burying grounds to outdoor museums,
repositories of folk art and sculpture, genealogical information,
even evidence of the language of earlier eras.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tell us a lot about our ancestors and the world they
lived in,'' Ms. Gabel said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   There is also an intimacy that comes from reading epitaphs of
early Americans, which can be ennobling, poignant or chilling.
</P>
<P>
   At Concord's Old Hill Burying Ground, there is inspiration in
the sturdy slate that marks the grave of Col. John Buttrick, who
led the colonial militiamen who engaged the British at the town's
North Bridge on April 19, 1775.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did he survive the Revolution, but, the stone declares,
``Having laid down the sword with honor, he resumed the plough with
industry; by the latter to maintain what the former had won.''
</P>
<P>
   Or one can be haunted by the memorial to the Rev. Charles T.
Torrey in Cambridge's Mount Auburn Cemetery. A Yale graduate, he
was arrested in Baltimore for helping slaves to freedom and died of
tuberculosis in the penitentiary in 1846. Engraved on a white
obelisk are some of his last words: ``It is better to die in prison
with the peace of God in our breasts than to live in freedom with a
polluted conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   I began my tour in Boston, where three old burying grounds lie
an easy walk from one another. On Tremont Street, near Boston
Common, is the site of both King's Chapel Burying Ground and the
Old Granary Burying Ground, which hummed with tourists the day I
visited.
</P>
<P>
   They were enticed most likely by its central location and the
all-star roster of patriots _ Paul Revere, John Hancock, Samuel
Adams _ interred there.
</P>
<P>
   Modern plaques lie among the gravestones, explaining how the
carvers first sketched the slates with chalk or ink, then cut them
with an awl or chisel.
</P>
<P>
   One plaque provides the name of a carver, Henry Christian Geyer,
who came from a family of fishermen and also made plaster of Paris
models of dogs, cats and royalty. (About 300 gravestone carvers who
worked before the year 1800 have been identified, said Ms. Gabel,
co-author of two books on the subject.)
</P>
<P>
   Historical information can also be found down the street in
King's Chapel Burying Ground, resting place of John Winthrop, first
governor of Massachusetts Bay Colony; Mary Chilton, the first woman
to step off the Mayflower, and William Dawes, who rode to warn
people of the British march to Concord on the same night as Revere.
</P>
<P>
   King's Chapel itself is a gray, stone building with Doric
columns. Begun as an Anglican church in 1717, it houses a
Unitarian-Universalist congregation. A sign inside says 30,000
sermons have been preached from its pulpit.
</P>
<P>
   Although I grew up in Boston's suburbs, there are parts of the
city I feel uncomfortable navigating without a map, such is the
configuration of the streets.
</P>
<P>
   I took one along to find Copp's Hill Burying Ground in the North
End, near Christ Church, more famously known as Old North.
</P>
<P>
   At Copp's Hill, I had the good fortune to encounter a highly
knowledgeable guide, dressed in period costume, meticulously acting
the part of a late-18th-century Bostonian. She gave her name as
Mistress Elizabeth de la Rue, spoke in detail about the burying
ground and guided a few of us among its more notable graves,
including that of the Rev. Cotton Mather, the Puritan minister and
scholar.
</P>
<P>
   Mistress Elizabeth never broke character, so it was only later
that I learned that although the name belonged to a real Bostonian
of that era, she is largely the creation of Donna La Rue, a
doctoral student at Boston University, who has been giving tours of
local burial grounds since 1991 (between July 4 and Labor Day
only), sponsored by the city's Parks and Recreation Department.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. La Rue said she had done research on burying grounds in
Boston, Cambridge and Salem, and values the older gravestones for
their combination of iconography and text.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially the colonial ones are very confrontative and speak
to us about people's lives'' in a way that modern tombstones rarely
do, she said. ``They read like a book.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, I caught the subway to Cambridge. From Harvard
Square, it's a half-hour's walk to the Egyptian Revival gate of
Mount Auburn Cemetery, established in 1831, listed on the National
Register of Historic Places and fully prepared to welcome visitors
on foot or by car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Discover Mount Auburn,'' urged a pamphlet I picked up from a
rack inside the gate, along with a map that identified gravesites
and monuments, and through which I discovered the Torrey monument.
With its lushly planted grounds and small ponds, Mount Auburn is
the nation's first ``garden cemetery'' and a favorite among bird
watchers. I saw plenty of people who just seemed to be taking a
walk, including two women pushing strollers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word cemetery derives from the Greek and means sleeping
place.'' the pamphlet said. ``Its use in this country began with
Mount Auburn's founding.'' In that sense, it replaced the more
prosaic term burying ground.
</P>
<P>
   In place of the winged skulls in the older burying grounds,
there are at Mount Auburn obelisks, stone urns, broken columns and
Celtic crosses. Another difference is that a number of the older
graveyards are often linked to the Revolution, its veterans buried
therein, while Mount Auburn carries associations with the Civil
War.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Ward Howe, author of ``The Battle Hymn of the Republic,''
is buried there.
</P>
<P>
   And one can also find a monument of a brown stone framing a
piece of carved white marble, erected by Robert Gould Shaw, a
Boston merchant whose grandson (of the same name) commanded the
54th Massachusetts infantry, the African-American regiment pictured
in the 1989 movie ``Glory.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby a large stone sphinx commemorates the North's victory,
with the inscription ``American Union Preserved, African Slavery
Destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Another imposing structure, devoid of martial claims, sits above
a pond called Halcyon Lake in the cemetery's southwestern corner. A
circle of eight Corinthian columns on an elevated base mark the
tomb of Mary Baker Eddy, founder of Christian Science and one of
the most influential female figures in American religious history.
</P>
<P>
   A great concentration of the 19th-century's literary genius lies
about 20 miles away in Concord's Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, a rambling
spread near the town's center. On a rising ground called Authors'
Ridge are the graves of Henry David Thoreau, Nathaniel Hawthorne
and Louisa May Alcott, as well as a rough chunk of granite over the
resting place of Ralph Waldo Emerson.
</P>
<P>
   Emerson is flanked by his wife, Lidian; their son Waldo, who
died at age 5, and their daughter Ellen, whose epitaph notes that
although ``of a fine mind, she cared more for persons than for
books.''
</P>
<P>
   Personal statements of an earlier time can be found at the Old
Hill graveyard, overlooking Concord's center. On some 18th-century
headstones are carvings of tiny, impassive-faced figures standing
in arched doorways. Those, Ms. Gabel said, were the work of a local
carver and adorn the stones of women and children.
</P>
<P>
   One of those stones marks the resting place of Elizabeth Blood,
dead in 1775 at age 34. Whoever carved it came from the same
tradition as the person who put the Latin phrases on the
gravestones at King's Chapel.
</P>
<P>
   The epitaph states, in part: ``All you that passeth by, as you
are now, so once was I, as I am now, so must you be, prepare for
death and follow me.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words, Ms. La Rue said, are ``the most common couplet
found on stones'' of that period.
</P>
<P>
   And not easily forgotten, I might add.
</P>
<P>

BUMPY WEEK NEXT HAZARD FOR RUSTY STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the road to the Stanley Cup, don't forget to enjoy the
scenery.
</P>
<P>
   And when we last left the Stars, Bryan (No Mas) Marchment was on
his knees and turning both cheeks. A couple of slaps from the
gloved hand of Grant Marshall failed to bring a manly response by
Mr. Most Hated.
</P>
<P>
   That strange scene has thus far been the highlight of the trip.
But if you ask tour guide Ken Hitchcock _ and even if you don't ask
_ he will explain his problem with the whole deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me,'' the Stars coach said yesterday, ``we will be
hearing again from Mr. Marchment. He will have a response, but he's
going to pick his time and his place to strike back. Marchment
knows the right time to do it. Our guys have to be aware and also
prepared to take advantage of whatever he has in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Road hazard alert: The Stars have a game Wednesday in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   But of immediate concern for Hitchcock is that Marshall's
slapping a docile Marchment happened nearly a week ago. The Stars
have been parked since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our overall game \Ragainst San Jose\S was very sound, the best
it's been thus far,'' Hitchcock said. ``I don't like it when an
older team like ours has to shut down for this long. We had things
rolling, then we have to stop, now we have to get back up to speed
in a hurry. I wish we'd had a game earlier this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock, of course, is paid to sweat this kind of small stuff,
but all along he's been a stickler about the Stars' paying
attention to even October details. Do it now, do it next month and
keep doing it until, well June _ so says Hitch.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of June, somebody named Detroit is at Reunion on
Saturday night, but Hitchcock barely gave it a passing mention
yesterday. That's because Anaheim is a Reunion visitor tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be truthful: Three weeks ago when the season started, I
watched a couple of Detroit games on TV,'' Hitchcock said. ``Since
then I haven't spent more than five minutes watching any game
except us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that the season is under way, all that really matters
anymore is Dallas. We have to pay attention to our game and our
objectives on an opponent-by-opponent basis. That's what they are
doing in Detroit, and that's why Detroit is where it is in this
league.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Stars have accomplished thus far is the expected.
Because of an abundance of October home games, anything other than
this successful start (5-1-1) would have been unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock is known as a hard coach to please, but for now his
complaints are at a minimum. The one loss was in Chicago, with an
ugly collapse involved, but Hitchcock believes that game became a
positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say I'm disappointed about anything, at least thus
far,'' he said. ``The expectations over this team are based on the
previous season and the addition of Hull \RBrett\S. But what I keep
stressing is you can never take for granted team chemistry carrying
over from one season to the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chemistry changes because the mind-set of players change,
based on what their individual situation might be. The free
agent-to-be has his goals. The player who wants to impress
management, hoping for a larger role on the team, has his goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Only once the season starts, added Hitchcock, does the flow of
team chemistry begin to develop. ``It can't be assumed it will go
the right way,'' he said. ``But with what's been seen up to now,
we've got a positive working in chemistry.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of us figured Hitchcock privately enjoyed his team's bad
showing in Chicago two weeks ago, simply because it gave him
something to scream about. With an elite team, a coach has to pick
his spots, and Chicago provided the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``My immediate reaction after that game was to question how we
would respond to it in practice,'' he said. ``And that's what was
very encouraging. This team wanted to get back to work on our
five-on-five play, which had probably been something taken for
granted since it was so good last season.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock would never say so, but the Stars' main objective
between now and April is to avoid injuries, boredom and maybe Mr.
Marchment. With the Red Wings in town this weekend, boredom won't
be a concern.
</P>
<P>
   And for comic relief, there's always the treasured snapshots of
Marchment turning both cheeks.

 &HT;    Flawless liftoff marks Glenn's return to space
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Scott Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ Sen. John Glenn made his thunderous
return to space Thursday on a day commanded by wonder and undercut
by a technical flaw that space flight engineers were evaluating as
Glenn circled the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle roared flawlessly from its beachfront pad at the
Kennedy Space Center to the words ``liftoff of Discovery with a
crew of six astronauts and one legend.'' But soon afterward, NASA
officials saw on video replay that a small metal panel dropped off
the tail end of the shuttle just as engines fired.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers believe it was the door that covers the shuttle's drag
parachute, used for landing. Engineers said the exposed parachute,
still packed in its well at the base of the tail, should cause no
problems upon reentry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no hazard to the vehicle in orbit,'' said Donald R.
McMonagle, manager of launch integration for the shuttle. ``Our
preliminary analysis is, we're OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Engineers are planning to meet this morning to decide if any
action should be taken to address the situation.
</P>
<P>
   But if it had been Glenn's wish to fly in space just as he did
36 years ago, he may have come closer than he ever expected.
</P>
<P>
   When Glenn became the first American to orbit the earth in 1962,
his reentry became a moment of intense drama when a faulty switch
sent a false signal that the capsule heat shield had slipped loose.
Although this shuttle's small door is not the equivalent of the
Mercury capsule's crucial heat shield, the glitch in an otherwise
radiant day for NASA crews was clearly reminiscent.
</P>
<P>
   Postcard-like weather combined with the presence of President
Clinton heading a fleet of VIPs to give the science mission launch
a feel of historic proportion. The day-to-day job of launching
rockets into the heavens came clear, in all the public attention,
as the extraordinary business it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is very, very proud of you today,'' President Clinton
told NASA engineers at the launch control center, where he watched
the launch with First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Discovery is loaded with six other astronauts and 83 science
experiments, including several that will focus on Glenn and the way
his aged body reacts to space. Glenn has fought a public relations
battle throughout his eight-month training to get attention for the
masses of science in his nine-day flight, but he lost that battle
again on launch day. It was the obvious history being made _ the
thrill of a 77-year-old space hero from another era, returning to
service to the realm that made him an international figure _ that
energized the day and the people who watched.
</P>
<P>
   The crowds at the launch were filled with the men of NASA's
glory years, from moonwalker Buzz Aldrin, to the three other
surviving Mercury astronauts who flew when Glenn did. And if
anybody dared to miss the historic point, about three hours into
the mission Glenn radioed in an observation he made famous during
his first flight. At 5:30 p.m., America again heard Glenn in orbit
say, ``Zero G and I feel fine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is PS 2 and they got me sprung out of the middeck for a
little while,'' said, Glenn, referring to his low rank and worse
seating assignment during the launch. ``We're just going by Hawaii
and that is absolutely gorgeous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger that,'' mission control responded. ``Glad you are
enjoying the show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Enjoying the show is right,'' Glenn said, ``boy this is
beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, Commander Curt Brown piped up: ``Let the record show that
John has a smiling face and it goes from one ear to the other one,
and we haven't been able to remove it yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's wife Annie watched the liftoff from the roof of the
massive vehicle assembly building about three miles from the pad,
and a spokesman said she thought it was ``wonderful'' to watch. She
was joined by daughter Lyn, 51, and son David, 53, who also brought
his wife and two teenaged sons. The family was not available for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   But the absence of the Glenn family did nothing to dull the
excitement of the afternoon. For days it has been clear that launch
conditions would be perfect, building anticipation for the moment
when Glenn again would leave the earth for space.
</P>
<P>
   Then twice in the closing minutes, the countdown clock froze.
First for a minor technical hiccup, then with five minutes to go,
liftoff was delayed for about 15 minutes when two private planes,
apparently jockeying for better viewing position, crossed into
controlled air space.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a little exercise there at the end,'' said Ralph Loe,
launch director, ``by a couple of nuisance problems really that
made us sweat a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   But the sight of the shuttle riding a thick stream of fire,
traveling at 1,715 mph just a minute after leaving the pad, drew
grateful applause and nearly involuntary calls of excitement from
jaded reporters and awe-struck visitors alike. ``C'mon! Go! Go!''
people yelled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised, I couldn't keep quiet,'' said Andrew Chaikin,
author of the book A Man on the Moon, which is a detailed recount
of the Apollo program. ``I tried, but I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't the only one caught off guard the emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Muskingum College junior Maria Rittenhouse covered the launch
for the college radio and TV stations where she is news director
back in Ohio. Muskingum is Glenn's almamater, and a large
contingent from the school came to Florida for the launch.
Rittenhouse planned to give moment-by-moment descriptions of
Discovery's ascent _ and failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cried. I could not put what I felt into words,'' she said,
wiping away fresh tears. ``I thought I could prepare myself. I
thought it would be a launch like you see on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't. The shuttle's white plume towered over the launch
complex as the ship itself became a point in the sky, a star. The
sound of five rocket engines wrent the air, enveloping the press
center grandstand in a drumroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was earth-shattering,'' Rittenhouse said. ``It touched my
brain, my soul. It was hard to be a journalist.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio Gov. George Voinovich called it ``awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got tears in my eyes,'' he said. ``It's unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   The crew suited up at about 10 a.m. in a room decorated with
signs taped above the seats of each astronaut, except Glenn. The
signs celebrated the ``Curt Brown Parkway,'' or ``Steve Lindsey
Parkway,'' in an obvious attempt to needle Glenn, for whom a
section of NASA Road 1 in Houston was temporarily renamed the
``John Glenn Parkway.''
</P>
<P>
   By 11:40 a.m. Glenn was on the gantry platform 195 feet in the
air, at the entrance to the shuttle itself. It was from this same
spot, last month, that he used a telephone on the gantry and shared
a laugh with his wife Annie while he waited is turn to load into
the shuttle during a countdown test.
</P>
<P>
   And then at 2:29 p.m., mission control barked from the metal
loudspeakers, ``John Glenn is in orbit for the second time in his
life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bit more emotional than I expected,'' said Jack
Sparks, Glenn's senate spokesman who has worked with him for 10
years. ``You're excited, you're scared, but you're also proud, very
proud.''
</P>
<P>
   And if you're John Glenn, you're almost unbearably happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``First report is great,'' Glenn said from the shuttle. ``I
don't know what happens on down the line, but today is beautiful
and great and Hawaii is just... I just can't even describe it.''

FELINES, NOTHING MORE THAN FELINES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's the week of the cats.
</P>
<P>
   Two excellent straight-to-video productions involving felines
made their way into stores this week. ``The Lion King II: Simba's
Pride'' (Disney) is a worthy successor to the original, while
``Cats'' (Polygram), a full-length re-creation of the production
staged for film, brings the magic of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical
home.
</P>
<P>
   Since it would be next to impossible to capture the roar ``The
Lion King'' made at the box office and with critics, Disney quite
wisely aimed a bit lower and came up with a winner. ``Simba's
Pride'' is a charming and entertaining tale of grrl power,
revolving around Kiara, Simba's rebellious daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Gone is wicked Uncle Scar; so there's a new villain, Zira, an
evil lioness.
</P>
<P>
   There are also five delightful new songs and one recycled from
the Broadway musical, with ``Upendi,'' which is sung by Ladysmith
Black Mambazo, the best.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the voices are the same, with Matthew Broderick
reprising Simba and Moira Kelly as Nala.
</P>
<P>
   Their daughter, Kiara (voiced as a youngster by Michelle Horn,
then later by Neve Campbell) is strong-willed like her father.
Simba wants Kiara to stay within the family territory, but knowing
she may wander, he sends Timon the meerkat and Pumbaa the wart hog
(Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella) to follow her and, of course,
provide some humor.
</P>
<P>
   Kiara soon runs afoul of a band of outcasts led by Zira (voiced
by Suzanne Pleshette with a perpetual growl). Kiara is rescued by
Kovu (Jason Marsden), who has been chosen as Scar's heir and was
sent by Zira to spy on Simba.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Romeo and Juliet'' fashion, the offspring of sworn enemies
fall in love, which creates a moral dilemma for Simba.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lion King II'' ends on a positive note, one of forgiveness _
sort of a bigger Circle of Life. Along the way, though, it still
manages to be quite entertaining, which is something to remember
when your kids pop it into the VCR for the 100th time. And while it
doesn't match the original in animation or inspiration (and how
many features could?), there has been a lot of thought and care
taken with this sequel, and ``The Lion King II: Simba's Pride''
captures the spirit of its forefather.
</P>
<P>
   To make ``Cats,'' which was produced by Webber, London's Adelphi
was stripped and overhauled, creating more space and freedom for
the filmmakers. The result is a wonderful combination _ giving
``Cats'' the feel of a film while retaining the immediacy of the
stage.
</P>
<P>
   Based on 14 poems from T.S. Eliot's ``Old Possum's Book of
Practical Cats,'' the musical first opened in London in 1981. The
version has a number of ``Cats'' veterans in the cast. Most notably
Elaine Paige, who created the role of Grizabella on the London
stage and performed the showstopper ``Memory.''
</P>
<P>
   A non-``Cats'' veteran, stage and film actor Sir John Mills was
recruited to play Gus the Theater Cat.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by David Mallet (``Lord of the Dance''), ``Cats'' also
adds afew special effects to the mix, but they never interfere with
the essential things that make it fun _ the singing and dancing.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to sniff out this lively and colorful video first,
``Cats'' will air 8 p.m. Monday on KCET (Channel 28).

<TEXT>
<P>
   As Republicans and Democrats compete for advantage in the dash
toward Election Day, Americans view Republicans as more ethical but
say Democrats can better tackle the pivotal issues of education,
health care and the future of Medicare and Social Security, the
latest New York Times/CBS News Poll shows.
</P>
<P>
   And nearly seven out of 10 said that the drama that has
dominated the news throughout the year _ the White House sex
scandal _ would not affect how they voted in congressional races.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that the outcome of Tuesday's
congressional elections could shift significantly, depending on
which party can best get _ maybe even goad _ its supporters to the
polls. If turnout is average for a midterm election, for example,
neither side has a particular edge in the popular vote. But the
poll showed that Republicans' prospects would surge if, as some
analysts predict, turnout is unusually low.
</P>
<P>
   The poll helps explain why House Republicans decided
unexpectedly late this week to inject the scandal into the closing
debate with a multimillion-dollar advertising blitz. It also
explains why Democrats fired back with a commercial of their own
that emphasizes issues _ and the need to move beyond the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   At the close of a seemingly mercurial election season, featuring
a stormy and late session of Congress, Democrats and Republicans
are playing to their strengths: The poll found that one issue on
which Republicans have a decided advantage over Democrats _ 41
percent to 24 percent _ is the question of who has higher moral
standards.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, people expressed far greater confidence in
Democrats on a host of consequential issues. Fifty-one percent
voiced confidence that Democrats could improve education; only 30
percent said that of Republicans. And 57 percent said Democrats
were more likely to improve the health-care system; only 24 percent
said that of Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most striking, in what may be a sign of peril for
Republicans well beyond next week's election, the survey found that
the party has lost its edge on the issue of tax cuts, long a
centerpiece of Republican campaigns. While many candidates are
still hammering away about taxes this year, the poll found that the
public no longer associates Republicans, any more than Democrats,
with reducing taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Also encouraging for Democrats, the survey found a wide public
view that President Clinton is doing a good job _ a belief that has
prevailed despite the reverberations since January about his affair
with Monica Lewinsky. Sixty-five percent of Americans give Clinton
a high job-approval rating; the same proportion approve of his
handling of foreign policy. And 74 percent approve of how he is
handling the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The nationwide telephone poll of 1,118 adults was conducted
Monday through Wednesday. It has a margin of sampling error of
three percentage points in either direction.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike presidential campaigns, when the public's interest
escalates closer to Election Day, the poll found no such movement
this year. That may be because, as is often the case in midterm
campaigns, there do not seem to be any galvanizing issues.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, despite the broad perceptions of the parties, many
House, Senate and gubernatorial contests will turn on local issues,
strengths and weaknesses of individual candidates, and the potency
and force of local advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters are all over the map,'' said Fred Yang, a Democratic
pollster. ``There's no roiling issues. And there aren't any roiling
themes.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Fabrizio, a Republican pollster, said, ``Neither side has
really had a rallying cry.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a far different, and certainly calmer, environment from
what prevailed at this point four years ago, when voters were
furious about the doomed Clinton health-care plan and uncertain
about the economic picture.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, barely half of Americans rated the national
economy as good; now the figure is more than 80 percent. Then, more
than 70 percent disapproved of the way Congress handled its job;
that figure is now 49 percent. In the subsequent elections of 1994,
voters ousted Democrats from control of the House for the first
time in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, incumbents in both parties can take solace in the
fact that the public is far less restless than in past elections.
Half the respondents said that their own representative deserved
re-election. And 65 percent disagreed with the notion that
government would work better if all new people were elected this
year. In November 1994, 54 percent disagreed with that idea; in
June 1992, 49 percent disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   While no national poll can anticipate what will happen in
specific states and congressional districts on Election Day, the
survey found that neither Democrats nor Republicans are enjoying
any significant advantage. More than anything else, the outcome may
be tied to turnout.
</P>
<P>
   If turnout remains relatively steady for a midterm election _ at
about 39 percent of the voting-age population _ the poll shows a
vote of 48 percent for Republicans and 43 percent for Democrats.
But that difference is within the margin of error of plus or minus
five percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   If turnout is unusually high, about 47 percent, the vote would
be 45 percent for Republicans and 44 percent for Democrats. But
Republicans would have their biggest advantage if the fewest people
go to the polls. If turnout is only 31 percent, 51 percent of
voters say they would support Republican candidates while 41
percent would back Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also underscored why even some Republicans fear that
the commercials capitalizing on Clinton's troubles could backfire.
The public continues to view the impeachment inquiry in Congress as
having more to do with attempts at political gain by Republicans
than a sincere investigation of serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of Americans view the House Judiciary Committee's
handling of the matter negatively; most expressed little faith that
the hearings would be conducted fairly. The public is three times
more likely to blame Republicans than Democrats for that
partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   More than two-thirds of the public said Clinton's actions were
not consequential enough to warrant his being impeached and removed
from office. A plurality want the matter dropped entirely. Nearly
three-quarters of Americans say it would be better for the country
if Clinton finished his term rather than resigned, a seven-point
increase from a poll conducted two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Though a plurality chose Republicans over Democrats on the
question of who has higher moral standards, neither party is viewed
as putting forward candidates who are more honest. But 47 percent
say Republicans are seen as better able to uphold traditional
family values, compared with 31 percent for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats are viewed as more likely to understand the needs
and problems of American families by a margin of 50 percent to 28
percent. On issue after issue, Democrats have an advantage over
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, 53 percent of those polled said Democrats were
more likely to make the right decisions about Medicare; only 28
percent said that of Republicans. Fifty-two percent said Democrats
would make the right decisions about Social Security; for
Republicans the figure was 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   People also said, by a margin of 44 percent to 33 percent, that
the Democratic Party had better ideas than the Republican Party for
leading the country into the 21st century.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Upholding a pattern that has persisted for years, even though
people are relatively satisfied with their own representatives,
voters registered harsher evaluations of Congress as a whole.
Nearly two-thirds said that most members of Congress had not done a
good enough job to deserve re-election.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, most Americans give low marks to the current
session of Congress. A majority said Congress accomplished less in
1997 and 1998 than lawmakers do in a typical two-year period.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether their own representative cared more about their
needs or those of special interest groups, 45 percent said their
needs and 39 percent cited interest groups. But asked about
Congress in general, 64 percent said most representatives were more
interested in doing the work of special interest groups than in
addressing the concerns of voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're sitting on their thumb, twirling in circles,'' one
poll respondent, Emmajean Dry, 59, of Dallas, said in a follow-up
interview. Lambasting the Republican-controlled Congress, Ms. Dry,
who plans to vote for Democrats next week, added, ``Congress has
done nothing except try to get rid of Clinton _ and ruin the
Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   William Selby, 32, a Republican respondent to the poll who
installs garage doors in Maryland, said he was not dissatisfied
with Congress. ``Congress is doing well, doing what they were
elected to do,'' he said. ``Impeachment hearings is what they
should be doing by law.'' But, he said of the scandal, ``They could
probably be doing more if they didn't have the presidential
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The public was divided over whether the country needs a
Republican Congress to keep a check on a Democratic president.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that Speaker Newt Gingrich's already low
favorability rating has dipped to its lowest levels since January
1997, when he was embroiled in an ethics case. His favorability
rating now stands at 18 percent; his unfavorability rating is 43
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the Judiciary Committee, is
still unknown to most Americans even though he is presiding over
the impeachment inquiry. Sixty-two percent of Americans said they
do not know enough about him to register an opinion.
</P>
<P>
   In a year when as many as two-thirds of Americans are expected
to stay clear of the polls on Election Day, the survey found that
those people stand out in several ways from those who do vote. For
instance, the nonvoters are younger and less educated, have lower
incomes, and tend to prefer Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-three percent of the nonvoters have not attended college,
while only 43 percent of expected voters have not attended college.
Forty percent of nonvoters have family incomes of under $30,000 a
year, compared with 24 percent of expected voters. And 32 percent
of nonvoters are under the age of 30, compared with 13 percent of
the voters.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to whom they prefer for Congress, 49 percent of
the nonvoters said Democrats and 27 percent said Republicans. Those
who were expected to vote were evenly divided.
</P>
<P>
   Even people who say they plan to vote expressed dismay with the
state of American politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I disagree with all the negativism,'' said Mathew Feldman, 65,
a Democrat from Maryland. ``It has turned me off to a degree. I
wish it focused on what individuals can and will do, not just
knocking down the other person. There is a lot of money being
wasted on all campaigns.''

IN HIGH-PROFILE MURDER TRIAL, DEFENSE MAKES RISKY ADMISSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Del. _ It had been a riveting story from the start:
A wealthy and well-connected lawyer who was charged with killing
his girlfriend, who happened to work for the governor of Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   But this week, as the trial of the lawyer, Thomas Capano, began,
the tale grew so unpredictable that the case has become a
preoccupation not only in close-knit Delaware but also across the
Middle Atlantic States.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, in his opening statement to the jury, Capano's lawyer,
Joseph Oteri, said Capano had lied to everyone for 28 months when
he said he had nothing to do with the disappearance of the
governor's secretary, Anne Marie Fahey. Instead, the defense lawyer
acknowledged that Capano had, in fact, dumped Ms. Fahey's lifeless
body from a boat into the Atlantic Ocean on June 28, 1996. The body
has not been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   In one risky move, Oteri changed the trial for the prosecutors
and drew new attention to a case that has brought unusual scrutiny
to Wilmington's elite.
</P>
<P>
   ``People thought they could anticipate what the trial would
be,'' said Judith Ritter, a professor at Widener University School
of Law here. ``But now it's a big mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   The mystery now is what happened. Oteri only added to the
intrigue with his explanation. He said Ms. Fahey, 30, died as a
result of an ``outrageous, horrible, tragic accident,'' which he
did not describe. He told the jurors that a witness other than
Capano would testify about how Ms. Fahey died. He did not name the
witness.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everyone here has been drawn into the case. Even sports
call-in shows on the radio have been deluged with opinions on the
trial. The courthouse in downtown Wilmington is surrounded by
television trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers say Oteri's strategy of admitting some damaging
assertions is a common but hazardous one. The goal, they say, is to
try to win an acquittal by taking the sting out of inflammatory
accusations. Lawyers using the approach argue that, just because a
defendant committed some wrongs, that does not make him guilty of
more serious crimes, like murder.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Brafman, a prominent New York trial lawyer, said he
called the approach ``taking the case away from the government,''
because prosecutors were often unable to adjust quickly enough
after defendants made last-minute concessions.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Ohlbaum, a professor of criminal law at Temple University
School of Law in Philadelphia, said, ``Strategically, I assume it
became a forgone conclusion among the defense lawyers that there
was no way to beat the government's account on the disposal of the
body.''
</P>
<P>
   Capano, the oldest son in one of Delaware's wealthiest real
estate families, faced an unusual problem: two of his brothers and
a former mistress are cooperating with prosecutors. One of the
brothers, Gerard Capano, is expected to testify that he helped
Capano dispose of a body. Gerard Capano has told prosecutors he
does not know whose body his brother sent off into the Atlantic.
But he said he saw a human foot slip below the waves.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors obtained that testimony after an extraordinary
public standoff with the Capano family for 16 months. Over that
time, investigators seemed unable to challenge Thomas Capano's
insistence that he knew nothing about what happened to Ms. Fahey
after they had dinner together at a Philadelphia restaurant the
night she disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last fall, federal agents raided Gerard Capano's home.
They found a small amount of drugs. They did not charge him but,
instead, won an agreement that he would testify about what he knew
about the case.
</P>
<P>
   A second brother, Louis Capano Jr., is expected to testify that
Thomas discarded a sofa and a rug that might have been stained with
blood. The former mistress is expected to testify that she bought a
.22-caliber gun that she gave to Thomas Capano about a month before
Ms. Fahey vanished.
</P>
<P>
   But the only eyewitness testimony the defense had to contend
with seemed to be that of Gerard Capano. Professor Ritter said the
admission that Capano disposed of Ms. Fahey's body seemed to be an
all-or-nothing bet. To try to win an acquittal, she said, Capano
was running the risk that if he was found guilty, jurors might be
so repelled by his callousness that they could impose the death
penalty instead of a sentence that would spare his life.
Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   For prosecutors, the admission about the disposal of Ms. Fahey's
body has changed little in the trial so far. Legal experts say the
prosecutors must still go about the routine tasks of proving that
there was a murder and why Capano would have had a motive, the
means and opportunity to commit it.
</P>
<P>
   So, in a cavernous courtroom here every day this week, jurors
have heard the story of the secret affair of Capano, now 49, who
was married with four daughters, and Ms. Fahey, the unmarried
appointments secretary to Gov. Thomas Carper. The prosecutors say
Capano's motive was that Ms. Fahey was trying to break up with him.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors were told about the evolution of the affair. Ms.
Fahey had a history of insecurity, the jurors heard, and was
subject to manipulation by an older man. She was from a
hardscrabble background. Capano was able to shower her with gifts.
Although a pretty woman with brown hair, Ms. Fahey doubted her
appeal. She was anorexic and, though she was 5 feet 10 inches tall,
she sometimes weighed only 125 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   For 10 months before she died, there had been a new man in her
life, Michael Scanlan, now 34, a banker. From the witness stand,
Scanlan told the jurors he had known nothing about the relationship
between Capano and Ms. Fahey. Their own relationship, he testified,
was not sexual. Scanlan told the jurors he had learned of Ms.
Fahey's affair after she died.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had also learned that Capano had bought her a
big-screen television and an espresso maker and even offered to buy
her a sports car. Scanlan testified that his gifts were things like
sweat shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fahey's sister, Kathleen Fahey-Hosey, took the stand next.
She, too, she said, had known nothing about her sister's romance
with Capano.
</P>
<P>
   But in Ms. Fahey's empty apartment her family had found a diary.
In it was an entry from 1996, two months before she disappeared.
Ms. Fahey-Hosey read it to the jurors. It described the breakup
with the married man: ``I have finally brought closure to Tom
Capano. What a controlling, manipulative, insecure, jealous
maniac.''

CELINE, SPICE GIRLS ARE ALL RIGHT BY HIM
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Somebody asked me the other day if I had any
musical ``guilty pleasures.''
</P>
<P>
   I guess they were expecting a secret affection for Celine Dion
or disco or something. But, personally, and maybe it's because I've
always been extremely broad-minded about music, I honestly don't
have any guilty pleasures.
</P>
<P>
   For real.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing to feel guilty about. Asked to name favorite
records, Average White Band's brilliant 1974 self-titled slice of
Atlantic Records r&AMP;b springs immediately to mind.
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead and laugh.
</P>
<P>
   I also love Ashford &AMP; Simpson's long out-of-print ``I Wanna Be
Selfish,'' an album of pure soul genius.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Fela Kuti, Lee Perry, the Crusaders, Chet Baker, Esther
Phillips, Bud Powell, the Faces, the Sex Pistols.
</P>
<P>
   A ton of reggae and African music. Country from Merle Haggard,
the Louvin Brothers, Speedy West &AMP; Jimmy Bryant, Hank Williams.
Gospel sung by Dorothy Love Coates or Mahalia Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Be-bop, free jazz, the film scores of Nino Rota, Gang of Four,
even Herb Alpert &AMP; the Tijuana Brass. Folk, blues, classical,
opera, spoken word. Humble Pie's ``Rockin' the Fillmore.'' Peter
Frampton's beautiful solo debut.
</P>
<P>
   Guilt doesn't come into it. I guess if I dug something
completely mediocre, like AC/DC or Third Eye Blind, Lenny Kravitz
or anything by Puff Daddy or Master P, that would be an entirely
different matter.
</P>
<P>
   So, when I answered, ``You might think it's a guilty pleasure,
but to me, lots of '70s disco music, such as Chic or some of Donna
Summer's singles or stuff by Evelyn `Champagne' King is fantastic
music,'' the response was a bovine snort of derision.
</P>
<P>
   It was the giggle of somebody trapped in the straightjacket of
what she listened to in high school. Or whatever KROQ is trumpeting
this week.
</P>
<P>
   There was a similar response when I gave Dion a good review on
these pages after seeing her perform a highly entertaining,
well-paced and perfectly choreographed show at the Forum last week.
</P>
<P>
   When I went to see Dion, I knew what I was getting into. I
wasn't expecting the second coming of Ornette Coleman. I didn't
think I'd hear some wild improvisations on an Eastern-influenced
theme by John Coltrane.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't Jeff Beck I thought I'd be seeing on guitar backing
her up.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, I went to see Celine Dion the same way I approached the
Spice Girls at the same venue months earlier, knowing it would be a
highly professional, even enjoyable confection designed for the
masses that love her.
</P>
<P>
   Did I feel guilty about having a good time? Not a chance. &QL;

 By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Through a rare glimpse inside the human brain, a team of
American and Swedish scientists reported Thursday that they have
discovered the generation of brain cells in adult humans for the
first time, opening an important area of investigation into
possible new treatments for such debilitating neurological
disorders as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and stroke.
</P>
<P>
   The finding is one of a series of recent discoveries that have
overturned years of conventional wisdom about the human brain:
that, after birth, once brain cells died off they could never be
replaced. In one such finding last spring, scientists reported
substantial new cell growth in the brains of developing children
under age six.
</P>
<P>
   Now with the discovery in adults that cells are continually
dividing and producing mature new cells, the potential arises that
this regeneration may be used to mend a brain damaged by disease,
or to treat a disease caused by a damaged brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The door has been opened,'' said Dr. Fred Gage, the team
leader, at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla,
Calif, where the research was conducted in conjunction with
Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Sweden. It will be published in
the November issue of the journal Nature Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Gage cautioned that much more research is needed to learn
whether new cell creation can be put to work. But, he said, ``the
new research should prove interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   The new growth was discovered in the hippocampus, a center of
learning and memory in the brain. Dr. Bruce McEwen, a
neurobiologist at Rockefeller University in New York, called the
discovery an ``exciting development _ the isolation of a specific
part of the human brain where you actually caught a glimpse of new
cells being produced.'' McEwen and Dr. Elizabeth Gould of Princeton
University published findings last March on the discovery of
neurogenesis, as brain cell growth is called, in adult marmoset
monkeys. Gage and others had previously recorded it in rodents.
</P>
<P>
   The new study was done in post-mortem brain tissue taken in
autopsies on five cancer patients at Sahlgrenska Hospital. In a
range of between three weeks and two years before their deaths, the
patients _ ages 55 to 70, in both early and advanced stages of the
disease _ were given injections of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), a
chemical marker, or tracer to help determine later what was
happening in the hippocampus. This chemical-tracing technique is
now often used in cancer patients to determine whether malignant
tumors are proliferating, which prompted the Gage team to use it to
search for healthy cell production.
</P>
<P>
   After the patients died, the researchers used advanced imaging
techniques to find the markers, and confirmed that undeveloped
primitive cells were in fact dividing and continuing to divide, and
were producing new mature neurons as well. They also found
indications that this process continues until death. It is not
clear whether these primitive progenitor cells are actually stem
cells, which have a powerful capacity in the formative stages of
brain development for generating neurons that have a wide variety
of functions, or whether their capacity is more limited.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Greenough, a neuroscientist at the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, called the Gage team's work ``
incredibly clever.'' ``It provided science its first real
retroactive look at a live human brain in the process of creating
new cells,'' he said. ``And because of the presence of the
bromodeoxyuridine markers in the DNA, the conclusions are
absolutely credible.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   McEwen, like Gage, pointed out that future projects will have to
determine the precise functions of these new mature brain cells. In
general, neurons play a wide range of roles in directing the
operations of the body and the mind. Scientists still do not know
when they are produced, why they are produced or how long they can
survive.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional thinking that humans could not grow new brain
cells was based on the lack scientific evidence: no one would
choose to cut open the brain of a living person to prove it. But 30
years ago, a Purdue University neurobiologist, Dr. Joseph Altman,
first reported cell birth in the hippocampus of adult rats. Because
of the strength of the thinking of the day his work was ignored.
Then in the '80s Dr. Fernando Nottlebohm at Rockefeller found that,
in the brains of adult birds that learned new songs to attract new
mates, new cells were being created. When he tried to push the
notion that the adult brain in animals and humans could potentially
form new neurons, colleagues dismissed the notion as borderline
fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 1990s, with one animal study following another, the
race was to determine why the adult human brain could not perform
as effectively in this manner as those of rats, mice, tree shrews
and monkeys.
</P>
<P>
   Before his collaboration with the Swedes, Gage and his group
found that if they enhanced the living environments of the mice _
by giving them more space, more toys and fellow mice to play with _
the mice produced more new brain cells and performed better in a
series of behavioral tests.
</P>
<P>
   This, Gage and others said in interviews Thursday, indicates
that there may be a way to manipulate the new cell growth in humans
as well and make some difference in their physiology and brain
function. ``We have to try to determine whether we might be able to
have some positive control over how the human brain cells divide,''
said Gage. ``Once you know the chemicals and modulators that
control division, you can imagine that under disease or trauma
conditions you might be able to control with beneficial results.''
</P>
<P>
   The scientists emphasized that the hippocampus is one small area
of the cerebral cortex where a vast number of brain functions
occur. But it is the area where cell loss occurs in Alzheimer's
patients, so its importance is real. Why this disease, and other
neurological disorders, would occur despite the creation of new
neurons replacing the old is one of the many questions now to be
investigated.
</P>
<P>
   An editorial in Nature Medicine said the discovery ``opens the
possibility of autologous repair and regeneration'' in the brain.
It noted that Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea and
Alzheimer's disease all share a gradual loss of certain categories
of neurons, and that ``these losses might reflect not only the
insult that causes the neurons to die, but a failure of an
otherwise expected regeneration that ordinarily repairs the loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Last spring William Shankle, a neurologist at the University of
California, Irvine, reported in the Journal of Theoretical Biology
on his analysis of hundreds of autopsies studied in Boston by J.L.
Conel in the 1940s and 1950s: Shankle said the studies indicated
tremendous growth in the number of cells in a child's brain from
birth to age 6: adding some 400 billion. To him, that phenomenon,
coupled with the Gage study, indicates that new cell growth may
well be found in other areas of the adult brain outside of the
hippocampus.
</P>
<P>
   Shankle said experimentation might now begin with attempts to
use the newly created hippocampus cells in treating asphyxia,
caused by oxygen deprivation to hippocampus brain cells in drowning
or smoke-inhalation victims or to treat some forms of memory loss.
</P>
<P>
   Gage added: ``What may be as important as a new use for
therapeutic medicine may be a whole new way of thinking about how
healthy humans may respond or be made to respond to interactions
with our environment and improve or alter our contact with it.''

AFGHAN WHIGS LOSE THE GUILT ON `1965' DISC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Never one to make excuses for his libido, Afghan
Whigs singer Greg Dulli says about the group's straight-no-chaser
new disc that ``guilt takes a back seat to lust on this album.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Dulli's primary topic is the battle of the sexes. He's
just as comfortable playing the part of conqueror as he is the
conquered.
</P>
<P>
   Also to be expected is the Whigs' tendency to temper their
twisted rock 'n' roll with lashings of r&AMP;b attitude and groove. The
quartet's just-released ``1965'' (Columbia) sounds like the Rolling
Stones might if Mick Jagger and Keith Richards had grown up in
Cincinnati in the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``1965'' is the ideal follow-up to ``Gentlemen,'' the Afghan
Whigs' bleak 1993 breakthrough, even though there was one
full-length album and three extended singles between the two
titles.
</P>
<P>
   It's also the first Whigs record where Dulli has truly focused
on his voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was done screaming, and a lot of the screaming that went on
in the past had to do with my (romantic) situation,'' Dulli said
from his Cincinnati home. ``I was doing a bit of primal screaming,
I guess. See, I didn't start out as a singer. I was a drummer
first, but I became a vocalist by default. It took me awhile to
learn. I just got tired of shredding my vocal cords. And with this
record I wanted to find a more friendly environment for my voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Dulli found that environment in New Orleans, where the band went
to record its first album for Columbia. Back in 1990, the Whigs
became the first non-Pacific Northwest act signed to respected
indie Sub Pop in the years before Nirvana.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Dulli and company _ guitarist Rick McCollum, bassist
John Curley and new drummer Michael Horrigan _ cut two albums for
Elektra, the tortured, angst-ridden ``Gentlemen'' and the festival
of self-loathing called ``Black Love'' in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the magic this time really lies in the mix,'' Dulli
said. ``And I was done wallowing lyrically. I wanted a new subject
to write about.''
</P>
<P>
   He wanted a new subject because, as Dulli puts it, many of the
songs on ``Gentlemen'' and ``Black Love'' were inspired by ``one
particular girl who was driving me crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Whigs also collaborated with some unusual characters down
south. The Big Easy's legendary singer-songwriter Alex Chilton adds
some background vocals to ``Crazy,'' while ``John the Baptist'' is
buoyed by a horn section led by the Re-Birth Brass Band's Roderick
Paulin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't listen to rock 'n' roll until I was a teen-ager,''
Dulli explained. ``It was mostly soul, blues and country music.
When I got into junior high, that's when my friends turned me on to
Zeppelin and AC/DC. The Stones are my spiritual forefathers. But
soul and r&AMP;b _ that's what I still listen to today.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Whigs have been known to pull out an admittedly
bent cover of the Supremes' ``My World Is Empty Without You'' as an
encore.
</P>
<P>
   Dulli, who once penned a song called ``Fairfax &AMP; Fountain,''
site of a celeb-filled daily 12-step meeting, lived in Los Angeles
while the band was signed to Elektra. At one point, he even worked
at the Rhino Records store in Westwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't for that smoking ban, I'd live there today,'' he
says. ``What drove me out of town, though, was the driving. I'm too
antsy to sit in the car that long.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the label has high hopes that ``1965'' will break the
Whigs out of cult status, Dulli isn't optimistic about the state of
radio these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most unimaginative I've heard it be in a long, long
time,'' the singer said. ``It's heartbreaking because I grew up on
radio. My radio and my dog were my best friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I'll take elevator music over that junk.''

GLENN LIFTS OFF AGAIN AFTER 36 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ John Glenn went back to the beyond
Thursday, completing a 36-year struggle to escape gravity.
</P>
<P>
   A figure of history, politics, and the pantheon of heroes, the
77-year-old astronaut-senator blasted into the cosmos aboard the
space shuttle Discovery shortly before 2:20 p.m. from John F.
Kennedy Space Center.
</P>
<P>
   The spaceship carrying Glenn and six crewmates heralded its rise
with a ground-shaking drumbeat of its booster rockets, a stunning
white-orange light and a billowing, twisting column of white smoke.
Discovery then pierced a clear blue sky amid a frenzy of excitement
long denied to the US space program.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, some 30
members of Congress, a corps of celebrities and VIPs, Glenn's
family, and as many as 1 million onlookers basked and gasped in the
glory of the launch. Millions more interrupted their routines to
watch live on television, just as they did Feb. 20, 1962, when
Glenn won the nation's heart as the first American to orbit Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Three minutes after liftoff and 50 miles high, Glenn officially
became the oldest person ever in space, besting the previous record
by 16 years. Five-and-a-half minutes later, the shuttle having sped
far from viewing range, Glenn was back where he had yearned to be:
in orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours and 10 minutes into the flight, from 342 miles over
Hawaii, Glenn made his first contact with the world below, telling
ground controllers in Houston the view was ``absolutely gorgeous.''
Unlike the cramped capsule of his first flight, the larger shuttle
cabin allowed Glenn to float free.
</P>
<P>
   Then, quoting a comment he made 36 years earlier about
weightlessness, he said: ``Zero-G, and I feel fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Shuttle commander Curtis L. Brown then chimed in: ``Let the
record show that John has a smile on his face, and it goes from one
ear to the other one.''
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying Glenn and Brown on the nine-day voyage are pilot
Steven W. Lindsey; mission specialists Stephen K. Robinson, Scott
E. Parazynski and Pedro Duque of Spain; and payload specialist
Chiaki Mukai of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Though it appeared flawless to most observers, Thursday's launch
was delayed by 20 minutes because of two small glitches _ other
aircraft in the vicinity and a false alarm about a vent in the crew
cabin.
</P>
<P>
   NASA also reported what it described as a minor mechanical
failure: the door to the parachute that slows the shuttle during
landings was blown off during liftoff. The parachute did not appear
to be damaged, and even if it were, the shuttle can land safely
without it. As a result, NASA officials said the lost door posed no
threat to the mission or the crew.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what else Glenn's Discovery flight accomplishes, the
crush of publicity made children dream of space again. It also
offered a dramatic case for the enduring value of older Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the shuttle has proven the wisdom of reusing spacecraft
rather than discarding them after a single mission, sending a
septuagenarian to space has driven home a parallel point about
finding productive new roles for the elderly. And so, just as when
a 40-year-old Marine colonel squeezed into the Project Mercury
spaceship he named Friendship 7, Glenn Thursday carried aloft the
hopes and dreams of several generations.
</P>
<P>
   Bearing the title of Payload Specialist No. 2 _ his least
glamorous label in a half-century of wartime combat, pioneering
space flight and political achievement _ Glenn will be a human
guinea pig for studies on the similarities between the physical
effects of aging and weightlessness.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was only the second sitting president to witness a space
launch; Richard Nixon was first when he watched Apollo 11 in 1969.
After Thursday's launch, Clinton congratulated NASA and the crew
and called it ``a great day for America, a great day for our senior
citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Laughing, Clinton took issue with NASA Administrator Dan Goldin,
who thanked the president for having the courage to personally
watch a shuttle launch. ``We had confidence in you,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   NASA had tried during the months before the launch to play down
Glenn's role and focus on the entire crew and the scientific
mission. But at the very end, the space agency gave up any
remaining pretense about the public focus on an event that drew
more than 3,000 journalists, as opposed to 50 or so at other recent
launches.
</P>
<P>
   As the countdown entered its final stages, NASA flight announcer
Lisa Malone intoned, ``Less than one minute away from the historic
return of John Glenn to space.'' A few minutes earlier, Glenn's
Project Mercury colleague Scott Carpenter abandoned his plan to
wish the crew ``Godspeed, Discovery'' _ an updated echo of his 1962
message, ``Godspeed, John Glenn.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Carpenter said: ``It seems appropriate at this point to
say good luck, have a safe flight, and to say once again, Godspeed,
John Glenn.''
</P>
<P>
   The crew's mission _ the 123rd US spaceflight with humans
aboard, the 92nd shuttle mission, and the 25th flight by Discovery
_ will cover more than 3 million miles and will end with a
scheduled Nov. 7 touchdown here.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the tragic 1986 Challenger flight with Concord, N.H.,
school teacher Christa McAuliffe was so much attention paid to a
shuttle launch. Crowds packed area parks and lined beaches to watch
the liftoff. NASA, meanwhile, struggled to accommodate a VIP list
that stretched 22 pages.
</P>
<P>
   The justification for Glenn's inclusion on the flight was that
his senior citizen status would be an invaluable resource for 10
studies on topics including loss of muscle mass and bone density,
disrupted sleep patterns, a depressed immune system, and loss of
balance. All those ailments are the scourge of both space travelers
and the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Glenn's work _ which will include processing blood and
urine samples from his crewmates _ there are 73 other experiments
and the scheduled release of the Spartan-201 satellite, which will
spend two days studying the sun before being retrieved and brought
home aboard the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   It is far more complicated, though no more ambitious, than the
Friendship 7 flight, which also originated at Cape Canaveral.
Though it made space history, for Glenn it was an achingly brief,
4-hour-55-minute jaunt during which the lone astronaut was strapped
tightly to a chair. The ship completed three Earth orbits before
splashing down 800 miles southeast of Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
   The space center was renamed just days after Kennedy's
assassination to honor the president who in 1961 dared the nation
to put men on the moon. Glenn's orbital flight came just nine
months after Kennedy's challenge, and Kennedy flew here to pin a
medal to Glenn's chest.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn never made it to the moon, however, as Kennedy feared the
political fallout of putting a national hero at risk of a second
flight; just 10 months before Glenn's first flight, an unmanned
Atlas-Mercury rocket was destroyed when its guidance system failed.
</P>
<P>
   Just as politics played a role in one of the biggest
disappointments of Glenn's life, so too did political
considerations appear to win him a ticket back to space. Though
Clinton, NASA and Glenn denied it, the inclusion of Glenn on a
shuttle mission was viewed by some as payback to a partisan ally.
</P>
<P>
   The flight also has weighty political implications for NASA, a
perennial supplicant on Capitol Hill. Tops on the agency's wish
list is continued financial support for a multibillion-dollar,
US-Russian space station. However, Glenn himself won't be on hand
to help the space agency; he will leave the Senate in January after
four terms.
</P>
<P>
   Numerically, almost every comparison between Glenn's two space
flights favors Discovery. The shuttle schedule calls for a mission
length 42 times as long, and 42 times as far, as the 1962 mission;
Discovery is slated to complete 144 orbits, or 48 times as many as
Glenn's first trip; and the crew will float free of gravity in a
compartment 64 times the size of Friendship 7.
</P>
<P>
   And while 10 postponements dogged the launch of that early
rocket, Discovery lifted off on its first try, if a few minutes
late.

<P>
   As Republicans and Democrats compete for advantage in the dash
toward Election Day, Americans view Republicans as more ethical but
say Democrats can better tackle the pivotal issues of education,
health care and the future of Medicare and Social Security, the
latest New York Times/CBS News Poll shows.
</P>
<P>
   And nearly seven out of 10 said that the drama that has
dominated the news throughout the year _ the White House sex
scandal _ would not affect how they voted in congressional races.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that the outcome of Tuesday's
congressional elections could shift significantly, depending on
which party can best get _ maybe even goad _ its supporters to the
polls. If turnout is average for a midterm election, for example,
neither side has a particular edge in the popular vote. But the
poll showed that Republicans' prospects would surge if, as some
analysts predict, turnout is unusually low.
</P>
<P>
   The poll helps explain why House Republicans decided
unexpectedly late this week to inject the scandal into the closing
debate with a multimillion-dollar advertising blitz. It also
explains why Democrats fired back with a commercial of their own
that emphasizes issues _ and the need to move beyond the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   At the close of a seemingly mercurial election season, featuring
a stormy and late session of Congress, Democrats and Republicans
are playing to their strengths: The poll found that one issue on
which Republicans have a decided advantage over Democrats _ 41
percent to 24 percent _ is the question of who has higher moral
standards.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, people expressed far greater confidence in
Democrats on a host of consequential issues. Fifty-one percent
voiced confidence that Democrats could improve education; only 30
percent said that of Republicans. And 57 percent said Democrats
were more likely to improve the health-care system; only 24 percent
said that of Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most striking, in what may be a sign of peril for
Republicans well beyond next week's election, the survey found that
the party has lost its edge on the issue of tax cuts, long a
centerpiece of Republican campaigns. While many candidates are
still hammering away about taxes this year, the poll found that the
public no longer associates Republicans, any more than Democrats,
with reducing taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Also encouraging for Democrats, the survey found a wide public
view that President Clinton is doing a good job _ a belief that has
prevailed despite the reverberations since January about his affair
with Monica Lewinsky. Sixty-five percent of Americans give Clinton
a high job-approval rating; the same proportion approve of his
handling of foreign policy. And 74 percent approve of how he is
handling the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The nationwide telephone poll of 1,118 adults was conducted
Monday through Wednesday. It has a margin of sampling error of
three percentage points in either direction.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike presidential campaigns, when the public's interest
escalates closer to Election Day, the poll found no such movement
this year. That may be because, as is often the case in midterm
campaigns, there do not seem to be any galvanizing issues.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, despite the broad perceptions of the parties, many
House, Senate and gubernatorial contests will turn on local issues,
strengths and weaknesses of individual candidates, and the potency
and force of local advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters are all over the map,'' said Fred Yang, a Democratic
pollster. ``There's no roiling issues. And there aren't any roiling
themes.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Fabrizio, a Republican pollster, said, ``Neither side has
really had a rallying cry.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a far different, and certainly calmer, environment from
what prevailed at this point four years ago, when voters were
furious about the doomed Clinton health-care plan and uncertain
about the economic picture.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, barely half of Americans rated the national
economy as good; now the figure is more than 80 percent. Then, more
than 70 percent disapproved of the way Congress handled its job;
that figure is now 49 percent. In the subsequent elections of 1994,
voters ousted Democrats from control of the House for the first
time in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, incumbents in both parties can take solace in the
fact that the public is far less restless than in past elections.
Half the respondents said that their own representative deserved
re-election. And 65 percent disagreed with the notion that
government would work better if all new people were elected this
year. In November 1994, 54 percent disagreed with that idea; in
June 1992, 49 percent disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   While no national poll can anticipate what will happen in
specific states and congressional districts on Election Day, the
survey found that neither Democrats nor Republicans are enjoying
any significant advantage. More than anything else, the outcome may
be tied to turnout.
</P>
<P>
   If turnout remains relatively steady for a midterm election _ at
about 39 percent of the voting-age population _ the poll shows a
vote of 48 percent for Republicans and 43 percent for Democrats.
But that difference is within the margin of error of plus or minus
five percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   If turnout is unusually high, about 47 percent, the vote would
be 45 percent for Republicans and 44 percent for Democrats. But
Republicans would have their biggest advantage if the fewest people
go to the polls. If turnout is only 31 percent, 51 percent of
voters say they would support Republican candidates while 41
percent would back Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also underscored why even some Republicans fear that
the commercials capitalizing on Clinton's troubles could backfire.
The public continues to view the impeachment inquiry in Congress as
having more to do with attempts at political gain by Republicans
than a sincere investigation of serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of Americans view the House Judiciary Committee's
handling of the matter negatively; most expressed little faith that
the hearings would be conducted fairly. The public is three times
more likely to blame Republicans than Democrats for that
partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   More than two-thirds of the public said Clinton's actions were
not consequential enough to warrant his being impeached and removed
from office. A plurality want the matter dropped entirely. Nearly
three-quarters of Americans say it would be better for the country
if Clinton finished his term rather than resigned, a seven-point
increase from a poll conducted two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Though a plurality chose Republicans over Democrats on the
question of who has higher moral standards, neither party is viewed
as putting forward candidates who are more honest. But 47 percent
say Republicans are seen as better able to uphold traditional
family values, compared with 31 percent for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats are viewed as more likely to understand the needs
and problems of American families by a margin of 50 percent to 28
percent. On issue after issue, Democrats have an advantage over
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, 53 percent of those polled said Democrats were
more likely to make the right decisions about Medicare; only 28
percent said that of Republicans. Fifty-two percent said Democrats
would make the right decisions about Social Security; for
Republicans the figure was 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   People also said, by a margin of 44 percent to 33 percent, that
the Democratic Party had better ideas than the Republican Party for
leading the country into the 21st century.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Upholding a pattern that has persisted for years, even though
people are relatively satisfied with their own representatives,
voters registered harsher evaluations of Congress as a whole.
Nearly two-thirds said that most members of Congress had not done a
good enough job to deserve re-election.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, most Americans give low marks to the current
session of Congress. A majority said Congress accomplished less in
1997 and 1998 than lawmakers do in a typical two-year period.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether their own representative cared more about their
needs or those of special interest groups, 45 percent said their
needs and 39 percent cited interest groups. But asked about
Congress in general, 64 percent said most representatives were more
interested in doing the work of special interest groups than in
addressing the concerns of voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're sitting on their thumb, twirling in circles,'' one
poll respondent, Emmajean Dry, 59, of Dallas, said in a follow-up
interview. Lambasting the Republican-controlled Congress, Ms. Dry,
who plans to vote for Democrats next week, added, ``Congress has
done nothing except try to get rid of Clinton _ and ruin the
Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   William Selby, 32, a Republican respondent to the poll who
installs garage doors in Maryland, said he was not dissatisfied
with Congress. ``Congress is doing well, doing what they were
elected to do,'' he said. ``Impeachment hearings is what they
should be doing by law.'' But, he said of the scandal, ``They could
probably be doing more if they didn't have the presidential
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The public was divided over whether the country needs a
Republican Congress to keep a check on a Democratic president.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that Speaker Newt Gingrich's already low
favorability rating has dipped to its lowest levels since January
1997, when he was embroiled in an ethics case. His favorability
rating now stands at 18 percent; his unfavorability rating is 43
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the Judiciary Committee, is
still unknown to most Americans even though he is presiding over
the impeachment inquiry. Sixty-two percent of Americans said they
do not know enough about him to register an opinion.
</P>
<P>
   In a year when as many as two-thirds of Americans are expected
to stay clear of the polls on Election Day, the survey found that
those people stand out in several ways from those who do vote. For
instance, the nonvoters are younger and less educated, have lower
incomes, and tend to prefer Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-three percent of the nonvoters have not attended college,
while only 43 percent of expected voters have not attended college.
Forty percent of nonvoters have family incomes of under $30,000 a
year, compared with 24 percent of expected voters. And 32 percent
of nonvoters are under the age of 30, compared with 13 percent of
the voters.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to whom they prefer for Congress, 49 percent of
the nonvoters said Democrats and 27 percent said Republicans. Those
who were expected to vote were evenly divided.
</P>
<P>
   Even people who say they plan to vote expressed dismay with the
state of American politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I disagree with all the negativism,'' said Mathew Feldman, 65,
a Democrat from Maryland. ``It has turned me off to a degree. I
wish it focused on what individuals can and will do, not just
knocking down the other person. There is a lot of money being
wasted on all campaigns.''

WORDS OF PRETORIA REPORT: `EXTRAJUDICIAL KILLING' 
</HEADLINE>
   (with SAFRICA-TRUTH)  
 (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRETORIA, South Africa _ Following are excerpts from the final
report issued by South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission
on Thursday:
</P>
<P>
   PRIMARY FINDING
</P>
<P>
   On the basis of the evidence available to it, the primary
finding of the Commission is that:
</P>
<P>
   The predominant portion of gross violations of human rights was
committed by the former state through its security and
law-enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the South African state in the period from the late
1970's to early 1990's became involved in activities of a criminal
nature when, amongst other things, it knowingly planned, undertook,
condoned and covered up the commission of unlawful acts, including
the extrajudicial killing of political opponents and others, inside
and outside South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In pursuit of these unlawful activities, the state acted in
collusion with certain other political groupings, most notably the
Inkatha Freedom Party (I.F.P.). . . .
</P>
<P>
   Certain members of the State Security Council (the state
President, Minister of Defense, Minister of Law and Order, and
heads of security forces) did foresee that the use of words such as
``take out,'' ``wipe out,'' ``eradicate,'' and ``eliminate'' would
result in the killing of political opponents. They are therefore
responsible for deliberate planning which caused gross violations
of human rights.
</P>
<P>
   P.W. BOTHA
</P>
<P>
   During the period that he presided as head of state (1978-1989)
according to submissions made to and findings made by the
Commission, gross violations of human rights and other unlawful
acts were perpetrated on a wide scale by members of the South
African Defense Force, including:
</P>
<P>
   The deliberate unlawful killing and attempted killing of persons
opposed to the policies of the Government, within and outside South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The widespread use of torture and other forms of severe ill
treatment against such persons.
</P>
<P>
   The forcible abduction of such persons where were resident in
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   Covert logistical and financial assistance to organizations
opposed to the ideology of the A.N.C. and other liberation
movements. . . .
</P>
<P>
   INKATHA
</P>
<P>
   The Commission finds that in 1986, the South African Defense
Forces (S.A.D.F.) conspired with Inkatha to provide the latter with
a covert, offensive paramilitary unit (or ``hit squad'') to be
deployed illegally against persons and organizations perceived to
be opposed to both the South African Government and Inkatha. The
S.A.D.F. provided training, financial and logistical management and
behind the scenes supervision of the trainees, who were trained by
the Special Forces unit of the S.A.D.F. in the Caprivi Strip. The
Commission finds furthermore that the deployment of the
paramilitary unit in KwaZulu led to gross violations of human
rights, including killing, attempted killing and severe ill
treatment. The Commission finds the following people, among others,
accountable for such violations: Mr. P. W. Botha, Gen. Magnus
Malan, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The A.N.C.
</P>
<P>
   While it was A.N.C. policy that the loss of civilian life should
be ``avoided,'' there were instances where members of its security
forces perpetrated gross violations of human rights in that the
distinction between military and civilian targets was blurred in
certain armed actions, such as the 1983 Church Street bombing of
the South African Air Force headquarters. . . . In the course of
the armed struggle, the A.N.C., through its security forces,
undertook military operations which, though intended for military
or security force targets, sometimes went awry for a variety of
reasons, including poor intelligence and reconnaissance. The
consequences in these cases, such as the Magoo's Bar and Durban
Esplanade bombings, were gross violations of human rights in
respect of the injuries to and loss of lives of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals who defected to the state and became informers
and/or members who became state witnesses in political trials . . .
were often labeled by the A.N.C. as collaborators and regarded as
legitimate targets to be killed. The commission does not condone
the legitimization of such individuals as military targets and
finds that the extrajudicial killings of such individuals
constituted gross violations of human rights.
</P>
<P>
   The commission finds that, in the 1980's in particular, a number
of gross violations were perpetrated not by direct members of the
A.N.C. or those operating under its formal command, but by
civilians who saw themselves as A.N.C. supporters. In this regard,
the Commission finds that the A.N.C. is morally and politically
accountable for creating a climate in which such supporters
believed their actions to be legitimate and carried out within the
broad parameters of a ``people's war'' as enunciated by the A.N.C.
</P>
<P>
   A.N.C. CAMPS
</P>
<P>
   The Commission finds that suspected ``agents'' were routinely
subjected to torture and other forms of severe ill treatment and
that there were cases of such individuals being charged and
convicted by tribunals without proper regard to due process,
sentenced to death and executed.
</P>
<P>
   WINNIE MADIKIZELA-MANDELA
</P>
<P>
   The Commission finds that Ms. Madikizela-Mandela was central to
the establishment and formation of the Mandela United Football
Club, which later developed into a private vigilante unit.
</P>
<P>
   It is the Commission's view that Ms. Madikizela-Mandela was
aware of the criminal activity and the disquiet it caused in the
community, but chose deliberately not to address the problems
emanating from the football club.
</P>
<P>
   The Commission finds that those who opposed Ms.
Madikizela-Mandela and the Mandela United Football Club, or
dissented from them, were branded as informers and killed. The
Commission finds that Ms. Madikizela-Mandela . . . is accountable,
politically and morally for the gross violations of human rights
committed by the Mandela United Football Club.
</P>
<P>
   The Commission finds further that Mrs. Madikizela-Mandela
herself was responsible for committing such gross violations of
human rights. . . .
</P>
<P>
   BUSINESS
</P>
<P>
   Business was central to the economy that sustained the South
African state during the apartheid years. Certain businesses,
especially the mining industry, were involved in helping design and
implement apartheid policies. The white agriculture industry
benefited from its privileged access to land.

   R.E.M./``Up'' (Warner Bros.)
</P>
<P>
   With burbling guitars, drum loops, reverb-laden vocals, sonic
layering and stream-of-consciousness lyrics that make even less
sense than usual, you might suppose upon first listen that R.E.M.
had finally gone off the deep end. Newly shorn of its longtime
drummer, the enigmatic band utilizes '90s trickery and technology
for inspiration while relying on Michael Stipe's warm, instantly
recognizable voice to anchor things. The gambit works especially
well on ``Daysleeper,'' the subliminal `` Airportman'' and the more
conventional ``Lotus,'' while the Brian Wilson homage ``At My Most
Beautiful'' gets lovelier with each spin. More mood-oriented than
song-oriented, ``Up'' could carry R.E.M. fans expecting ``Shiny
Happy People'' in the completely opposite direction. That's one
reason the disc won't wear out its welcome for a long time. 3 stars

   VARIOUS/``Sabrina the Teenage Witch _ The Album'' (Geffen)
</P>
<P>
   This ABC-TV series spinoff offers a nicely varied selection of
energetic hits from some of pop's brightest young stars. Among the
teenybopping tastiest are a new mix of the Backstreet Boys' ``Hey
Mr. DJ (Keep Playin' This Song),'' 'N Sync's ``Giddy Up,'' the
debut of the Spice Girls' ``Walk of Life,'' Pure Sugar's cover of
the Waitresses' chestnut ``I Know What Boys Like,'' and sweet
moments from the Cardigans, Robyn and Ben Folds Five. Melissa Joan
Hart, who plays Sabrina on the series and plugs the album today on
``Donny &AMP; Marie,'' has fun with Blondie's new-wave hit ``One Way or
Another.'' 2 1/2 stars

   BOOKER T. &AMP; THE MGS/``Time Is Tight'' (Stax)
</P>
<P>
   This biracial Memphis outfit drew the blueprint for Southern
soul as the house band at Stax Records in the '60s, backing
everyone from Albert King to Otis Redding. The quartet _ known for
the enduring instrumental hits ``Green Onions,'' ``Soul-Limbo'' and
``Time Is Tight'' _ was as much about what notes were left out as
played. Feel and groove were always paramount. The near-telepathic
interplay between guitarist Steve Cropper and the MGs' late, great
drummer Al Jackson Jr. shines throughout this well-packaged,
recommended triple-disc set. Seamless, classic sounds. 4 stars

   SYL JOHNSON/``Bridge to a Legacy'' (Antone's)
</P>
<P>
   Though his roots run deep in Chicago, Johnson is a Southern soul
singer at heart, not least of all because his greatest albums were
cut in the '70s for producer Willie Mitchell's revered Hi label.
This self-produced effort finds Johnson in fine form, whether
sharing the spotlight for a tune with kid guitar star Jonny Lang,
dueting with daughter Syleena, or leading the charge on such
gleaming, horn-driven standouts as ``Who's Still in Love'' and
``They Can't See Your Good Side.'' 3 stars

   The latest Fugee to drop a solo disc, Pras Michel is selling
records because of the hooky title track, which owes its life to a
Bee Gees sample and was first exposed on the ``Bullworth''
soundtrack. While the beats and grooves here are generally OK,
co-producer Pras is no freestyler, and his rapping skills pale next
to guests like Canibus and Mack 10. Making matters worse, he
includes 12 excruciating minutes of ham-fisted bad comedy _ you
guessed it: answering-machine skits, hip-hop's most tired cliche. 2

Notorious B.I.G., r&AMP;b singer Evans is hip-hop's most famous widow;
that's her on the Puff Daddy/Police smash ``I'll Be Missing You.''
Now comes her long-awaited sophomore effort, and everything about
it screams ``show me the money.'' This is a record designed to rake
it in, from the large number of second-rate, overproduced,
chablis-sipping ballads like ``Lately I'' and ``Caramel Kisses'' to
cliche-ridden lyrics that aim to milk the media-fueled story.

   This consistently enjoyable and completely unexpected left-field
delight from producer/writer/singer Gregg Alexander is a nifty
slice of blue-eyed rock 'n' soul that owes more than a little to
Prefab Sprout's overlooked smart-pop masterpiece ``Two Wheels
Good.'' Using a brace of newcomers and session vets like
percussionist Lenny Castro and keyboardist Greg Phillinganes,
Alexander offers irreverent lyrics and instantly likable melodies
on winners such as radio fave ``You Get What You Give'' and the
witty ``I Hope I Didn't Just Give Away the Ending.'' 3 1/2 stars

   Here's a double-disc live set that catches Aerosmith covering
material from the course of its quarter-century career. Taken from
tours in 1993-94 and 1997-98, the album will appeal to longtime
fans of the mainstream rockers, especially with such down 'n' dirty
workouts as ``Monkey on My Back'' and the early ``Mama Kin'' on
display. The prom crowd, too, will get a lift from energized
readings of power ballads ``Sweet Emotion'' and ``Dream On.'' 2 1/2

   Lately known more for remixes than its own fine material, this
clever Brit soul-pop trio throws in touches of Bacharach, Beach
Boys and Dusty Springfield as well as the latest club rhythms on
its first new disc since '94. Seductive, classy sounds, topped off
by the winsome Astrud Gilberto-like vocals of Sarah Cracknell, from
a trio that basically created the likes of Mono, Morcheeba and Air.

   This Tibetan thrush first showed her admirable set of pipes for
the world in the recent ``Seven Years in Tibet'' movie. Now Real
World has smartly paired her with brilliant Belgian producer Hector
Zazou (whose own star-studded albums ``Sahara Blue'' and ``Songs
From Cold Seas'' explore a wonderful range of world pop forms) for
an eminently satisfying musical mating. Normally heard a capella,
Lhamo's voice is as clear and cool as glacial ice, as quiet and
lonely as a shepherd in a mountainside meadow. But Zazou surrounds
her with crack Western instrumentalists in a cross-pollination that
can leave one as lightheaded as climbing a mountain pass at the top
of the world. 3 1/2 stars

   IRVING, Texas _ Fifteen seconds before John Glenn went up, up,
up, the high-definition television signal at an Irving Circuit City
store went down, down, down.
</P>
<P>
   The 56-inch Panasonic HDTV set, which will cost close to $10,000
when it goes on the market, went dark. Groans rose from the crowd
of 200, followed by chuckles.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a blunder,'' laughed Roy Farris, a 60-year-old retiree
from Irving. ``What a blunder.''
</P>
<P>
   Good thing those analog televisions _ the ones that the
superclear and vibrant HDTV is supposed to replace in a few years _
are still around. They came through in a pinch Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech set blanked out when someone pushed the record
button on a digital VCR, which was not properly set up and killed
the picture, said Alan Thacker, a technician for the electronics
store.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a matter of getting the bugs worked out,'' Thacker
said.
</P>
<P>
   But what Irving resident Mary Jane O'Brien did get to see amazed
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's fabulous,'' she said of the clarity. ``It's like being
there.''
</P>
<P>
   At least the Irving viewers got to see something. At Circuit
City in north Dallas, technical problems prohibited any gawking at
HDTV whatsoever, Thacker said.
</P>
<P>
   A Circuit City in Fort Worth was the only one in the Metroplex
where the broadcast went off without a hitch during the event,
sponsored by a TV station and the electronics retail chain.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Muscari, the creative services director for WFAA-TV, said
the glitches are part of ushering in a new technology. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like live TV,'' he said. ``You always run the risk of
things not working.''

GLENN MISSION SPAWNS ONE BIG PARTY IN FLORIDA

   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ John Glenn's private campaign to fly into
space again became a public celebration Thursday, generating cheers
of joy and relief at Kennedy Space Center, mobbed viewing areas and
raucous beach barbecues.
</P>
<P>
   As Glenn and his six crewmates roared into space aboard the
shuttle Discovery, about the only things remaining private were
their thoughts. Every movement, every word and every nuance related
to the mission was reported to a public ready for good news in a
time of scandal and economic uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Days before the launching, a party atmosphere was building as
guests and visitors filtered into the area. All week, at
receptions, barbecues and restaurant dinner parties, former
astronauts and old friends of Glenn have been holding court with
tales of the old days.
</P>
<P>
   ``John's return to space has been a marvelous thing for the
country and a marvelous thing for NASA,'' declared Scott Carpenter,
who with Glenn was one of the original seven Mercury astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the same reception at the Astronaut Hall of Fame
here Wednesday, Gordon Cooper, another Mercury astronaut, noted
that Glenn was in space for only five hours on his first fight.
``Now he will have time to enjoy it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The news media, represented by thousands of reporters,
cameramen, producers, editors and technicians, brought the liftoff
to hundreds of millions around the world. And hundreds of
thousands, who wanted to see for themselves, crowded nearby
shorelines and beaches, jockeying for the best points from which to
see the flaming rocket rise to their applause and cheers.
</P>
<P>
   The tourism department for Brevard County, which includes the
space center and nearby communities such as Cocoa Beach and Merritt
Island, estimated beforehand that more than 300,000 people would
flood into the area for the flight. Judging from local traffic
congestion and mobbed viewing areas, it appeared they all came.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses welcomed the attention and the influx of millions of
dollars after a disappointing summer, when wildfires in the region
kept tourists away. Many promoted a carnival atmosphere, scheduling
outdoor concerts and other events and hanging American flags along
coastal Route A1A, the main artery through Cocoa Beach. Ron Jon's,
a giant, pink emporium offering surfer gear and beachwear that is a
landmark on the strip, celebrated the flight Wednesday night with a
half-hour fireworks display. The fireworks had originally been
scheduled for July 4, but were canceled because of the fires and
dry conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Some visitors in campers and recreational vehicles arrived days
early to stake out prime viewing spots along area causeways and
beaches. At dawn Thursday morning, many more began filling in the
remaining spots, some sporting homemade signs hawking souvenirs
ranging from commemorative T-shirts to model rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Also appearing in great numbers were celebrities like Leonardo
DiCaprio, business leaders and politicians, led by President
Clinton and Hillary Clinton, and several Cabinet members.
Congressmen came by the score to cheer a colleague, including
fellow Sens. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.; Ted Stevens, R-Alaska; John
Warner, R-Va.; Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.; Bill Frist, R-Tenn.; Michael
Dewine, R-Ohio; Bob Graham, D-Fla., and Rod Grams, R-Minn. NASA had
so many invited guests, and many others who invited themselves,
that it had to expand its normal VIP area to several sites.
</P>
<P>
   The news media not only reported the story, but also were part
of it. Walter Cronkite came out of retirement to do commentary for
Cable News Network, and snagged an exclusive interview with Clinton
to show that he still could. When not doing interviews, Cronkite
was giving them, reminiscing for a new generation on how he covered
the space program from Mercury to Apollo.
</P>
<P>
   NASA received 4,000 applications for press credentials for this
mission, numbers not seen since the days of Apollo or the
beginnings of the space shuttle programs. For average shuttle
missions, about 700 usually ask for accreditation and between 300
and 350 show up, said NASA spokesman Bruce Buckingham.
</P>
<P>
   This time, there were few no-shows. The Kennedy Center press
site was so cluttered with satellite transmitter trucks, trailers,
vans and recreation vehicles that NASA had to ask some reporters to
leave their cars at remote lots and be bused to the center,
something that hasn't happened in years.
</P>
<P>
   After the successful launching of Discovery, the celebration
started again at local hotels and homes, in crowded restaurants,
and in the clubs and bars lining Cocoa Beach. Thirty-six years
later, John Glenn had made it.

</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Monday, Oct. 26,
about the cancellation of a trip by President Boris N. Yeltsin
because of health problems referred incorrectly to a statement by
his spokesman, Dmitri Yakushkin. Mr. Yakushkin said he had been
asked by the President to answer reporters' questions about Mr.
Yeltsin's health; he did not say Mr. Yeltsin intended to meet
journalists soon to discuss it.

`KATE &AMP; ALLIE' KID GROWS INTO A STAGE ACTOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ He looks innocent, all right, but watch out. That
blissful expression in Fred Koehler's eyes signals it's time for
his midmorning smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``No toxins in my cigarettes,'' Koehler says, smiling
mischievously as he lights up. ``Very oxymoronic.''
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute: Wasn't it only yesterday we were watching this
guy play Jane Curtin's prepubescent son Chip on ``Kate &AMP; Allie,''
the CBS sitcom that ran from March 1984 to September 1989?
</P>
<P>
   Now Koehler sits in the outdoor courtyard of Westwood's Geffen
Playhouse, a sharp, friendly 23-year-old savoring his next move in
what's suddenly become a very hot stage career.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, barely a year out of college, Koehler was singled
out by The New York Times for his portrayal of a young slacker in
Sharman Macdonald's comedy-drama ``When I Was a Girl, I Used to
Scream and Shout.'' Though Koehler's part was the play's smallest,
reviewer Peter Marks described him as ``a natural'' and praised his
``canny, effortlessly honest performance.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, there'll be no chance whatsoever of overlooking
Koehler. He's the title character in ``The Cripple of Inishmaan,''
Anglo-Irish playwright Martin McDonagh's black comedy about what
happens to a small Irish village when an American filmmaker arrives
there in 1934 to shoot a docudrama about the locals' seafaring
lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler plays the clever, disabled young man universally known
as Cripple Billy, who shares his neighbors' dreams of escaping
their bleak, impoverished existence and striking out for Hollywood.
While handicapped characters often are typecast as martyrs, Koehler
says that's not the case with Cripple Billy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think as an actor the thing is not to play (him) sympathetic
or even pathetic. He's capable of cruelty. He's the one (the
audience) is sort of rooting for, I would guess, but at the same
time he's not the type of character who would just stand on a box
of Wheaties being great while the other characters are bad. He's
not a victim. I think he's manipulative, but in a great way.''
</P>
<P>
   Riding a tsunami of expectations generated by McDonagh's
previous hit, ``The Beauty Queen of Leenane,'' ``Cripple'' was
greeted in New York last spring by some fairly scathing reviews.
(Since the opening, the 28-year-old McDonagh has stopped doing
interviews, at least temporarily, telling a Geffen representative
that his New York experience with the press had ``bored me
senseless.'')
</P>
<P>
   Koehler arrived at the Geffen well-versed in his role, which
he'd understudied for the New York production. Although director
Joe Dowling hadn't seen Koehler act before, an audition convinced
him he'd found ``exactly the right man for the job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very skilled actor, and there's also a kind of
wonderful, innocent sweetness in his look,'' says Dowling, an
Irishman who became artistic director of Minneapolis' renowned
Guthrie Theatre in 1995. ``But as soon as you meet him, behind
those eyes you also can see this wonderfully fun and beguiling
quality in him.''
</P>
<P>
   Unquestionably, Koehler looks the part. Wearing a baggy brown
sweater, work pants and heavy boots, with a faint reddish-brown
beard and a complexion that clearly hasn't spent the summer hanging
at Santa Monica Beach, he almost could be a steerage passenger
fresh off an ocean liner from County Cork.
</P>
<P>
   A somewhat unexpected confluence of events brought Koehler to
this pass. He admits he wasn't much interested in theater when he
entered Carnegie Mellon University to study drama. The first play
he ever saw was Andrew Lloyd Webber's ``Starlight Express.'' He
exited the theater thinking, ``I never want to do this. I didn't
want to be on Roller Blades, and I didn't want to be singing, and I
didn't want to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager, he'd been much more drawn to movies like ``A
Clockwork Orange,'' ``Taxi Driver'' and ``The Indian Runner.'' It
was only in college that he developed an equal passion for Sam
Shepard and David Mamet.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went to college, I was clueless about theater,'' he
says. ``Had never read a play. The difference between Neil Simon
and Shakespeare wasn't that great to me. It was ridiculous. I had
no idea how to project my voice, and I hadn't learned how to use my
body. I never would've been able to do this part (Cripple Billy) if
I hadn't gone to school.''
</P>
<P>
   Koehler also credits his ``Kate &AMP; Allie'' apprenticeship with
conditioning him for his new career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there are two better teachers you can have than
Jane Curtin and Susan Saint James,'' he says. ``I feel really lucky
about the experience. I never had any crazy child-actor syndrome.
Me doing `Kate &AMP; Allie' was almost like playing Little League. I
started it when I was 7 and ended it when I was 14. And by that
time, it was such a part of everyday scheduling. Be on the set by
10 and home for lunch by 1. It was nothing grander than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Chip, with his single mom and surrogate mom, Cripple Billy
has grown up in a matriarchy, dominated by his two devoted aunts.
Koehler can relate to that dynamic: He and his three older sisters
were raised in Jackson Heights, Queens, by their own single-parent
mom. Koehler says he hasn't seen his father since he left the
family when Fred was 4 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gone off and done his thing, and I've done gone off and
done mine, and I feel extremely lucky for it.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Koehler says, served as both parents, taking him
outside as a youngster to throw a football ``and demanding that I
catch it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Koehler, Dowling and the rest of the Geffen's production
team are hoping to pick up the ball and run with a play that failed
to score big in its previous outing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you get hype about something _ and I believe `Beauty
Queen' opened a couple months before `Cripple' did, and from what I
heard was a magnificent play _ when it opened with all the hoopla,
I think everybody's waiting for the sophomore jinx,'' Koehler says.
``If you're an NBA rookie and you score 20 points a game,
everybody's going to expect a slump the next season.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, the smart money may be on the sophomore with
the smiling eyes.

STOCKS GAIN AT BRISK PACE WITH PROFITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Blue-chip stocks on Thursday paced a brisk advance in
which the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 123.06 points _ its
best gain in two weeks _ to a level closer to its record peak of
mid-July than to its low of late August.
</P>
<P>
   More reports of surprisingly good or at least satisfactory
profits seemed to propel the rise, along with better feeling about
the Japanese banking system and what seemed to some a growing
likelihood that Election Day would bring no significant shift in
the American political landscape.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, mutual funds were said to be active as they
approached the end of October, the time for determining annual
capital-gains pay-outs to shareholders, a process that typically
involves shedding fallen stocks and reinvesting in winners.
</P>
<P>
   Investors shrugged off fresh government reports of a tight labor
market and doubts about whether Brazil's proposed fiscal package
would ultimately restore the country's financial credibility.
Brazil's chief stock index slumped 4.22 percent Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow rose 1.47 percent, to 8,495.03. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index rose even more than the Dow, with which it shares
key issues, posting a gain of 17.84 points, or 1.67 percent, to
1,085.93.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index and the Russell 2000 index of small
companies, which have lately been the pace setters as many
investors hunted bargains among smaller companies, gained 1.13
percent and 0.8 percent, respectively. Since Oct. 8, the S&AMP;P 500
has climbed 13.2 percent, Nasdaq is up 23.8 percent and the Russell
2000 has risen 20.7 percent. The S&AMP;P 500 and Nasdaq have returned
to double-digit gains for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The markets are responding to earnings,'' said Kevin Parke,
chief equity officer at MFS Investment Management in Boston.
``You've had pretty good earnings reports over the past eight days
after a month of disappointments.''
</P>
<P>
   Stocks of health-maintenance organizations and drug companies
were particular standouts in a day of widespread gains that even
included a few cyclicals, such as Alcoa, which climbed 3, to 77{.
</P>
<P>
   Wellpoint Health jumped 9 11/16, to 71 15/16, and Humana rose
1}, to 18 1/8 after reporting buoyant profits, while Oxford Health
Plans, which is scheduled to report Friday, surged 2 5/16, to 11\.
</P>
<P>
   Merck rose 3 15/16, to 135 15/16, making the biggest
contribution to the Dow, while Lilly advanced 2 15/16, to 80\,
American Home Products 2 13/16, to 49 7/16, and Pfizer 2 1/16, to
107}.
</P>
<P>
   And the American depository receipts of Zeneca Group rose 1 5/8,
to 38{ after the Food and Drug Administration announced it had
approved the company's drug for reducing the incidence of breast
cancer in women at high risk for the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks were another bright spot. Merrill Lynch led the
brokers, surging 4 7/16, to 56 9/16 after trading as low as 35}
three weeks earlier, while Morgan Stanley climbed 3 5/16, to 62
13/16.
</P>
<P>
   Among banks, J.P. Morgan, the second-biggest contributor to the
blue-chip average, rose 3 3/8, to 94{, while BankAmerica was up 2\,
to 57 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   ``Financial Armageddon isn't happening,'' said Joseph
Battipaglia, chief investment strategist at Gruntal &AMP; Co., who
called the 950-point rise from the Dow's Aug. 31 low a ``relief''
rally and predicted that prices would now be driven by corporate
fundamentals and drive the average past its record 9,337.97 by the
end of the year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Oil stocks benefited Thursday from a decline in gasoline
inventories, which a Merrill Lynch analyst said would likely mean
further improvement in profit margins from refining that have
emerged this month.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon rose 2\, to 72 11/16, Mobil climbed 2, to 74 7/8, and
Chevron was up 1 3/8, to 79 7/8.
</P>
<P>
   IBM advanced 2 9/16, to a record 148}, while Wal-Mart Stores
rose smartly for a second straight day, by 2 5/8 to 67 7/16 as an
official projected a strong holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com, the online bookseller, jumped 9 7/16, to 126{, after
reporting a smaller-than-expected loss and much stronger sales for
the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   New highs outnumbered new lows by 36 to 33 on the New York Stock
Exchange as 1,886 issues gained while 1,173 fell. Volume was 699.49
million, compared with 677.59 million on Wednesday.

CUBA CHARGES 4 SUSPECTS IN BOMB ATTACKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Four Central Americans are being held in Cuba and have
been charged with taking part in a bombing campaign that began last
year, the Cuban government announced Thursday. It contended that a
Cuban exile who boasted of organizing the attacks had recruited the
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Ministry said in Havana that one Salvadoran and
three Guatemalans were intercepted trying to smuggle explosives
into the island earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   All four, the note maintained, were deployed by Luis Posada
Carriles, a shadowy exile whom the Communist government of Fidel
Castro regards as its most relentless enemy.
</P>
<P>
   During five months last year, bombs exploded at nearly 1 dozen
hotels, restaurants and discotheques in Havana and at the resort of
Varadero. An Italian tourist was killed.
</P>
<P>
   In tape-recorded interviews with The New York Times in June,
Posada acknowledged organizing and directing the bomb campaign,
saying he wanted to hurt Cuba's tourism industry, which is Havana's
largest source of foreign exchange.

DAMAGE TO BRAIN LINKED TO HEAVY USE OF ECSTASY DRUG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By ERICA GOODE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The illicit drug known as ecstasy may cause long-lasting nerve
cell damage in the brains of heavy users, according to a report
published Thursday by scientists at Johns Hopkins University.
</P>
<P>
   The study compared the brain scans of 14 men and women who
reported having used the drug from 70 to 400 times with the scans
of control subjects who said they had never used it. The heavy
users of ecstasy, formally known as MDMA, showed a significant
decrease in brain cells responsible for reabsorbing serotonin, a
messenger chemical involved in mood, appetite, pain perception,
sexual drive and memory.
</P>
<P>
   People who take ecstasy on a recreational basis ``are
unwittingly putting themselves at risk,'' the scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   The research team, led by Dr. George Ricaurte, a neurologist,
developed a novel technique for tracking the cells, called
serotonin transporters, using positron emission tomography, or PET
scanning.
</P>
<P>
   Transporter cells are embedded in nerve cell membranes at the
tips of thin projecting fibers called axons. The reduction in
serotonin transporters in heavy users, Ricaurte said, is an
indication that serotonin nerve endings, where the transmitter is
released, have been damaged.
</P>
<P>
   It is still unknown whether people who have used ecstasy less
frequently _ taking it a few times over the course of years, for
example _ incur similar damage. Nor is it clear what if any effects
the nerve damage caused by heavy use might have on behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But Ricaurte said his team found early indications that MDMA had
some effects on memory. People who have taken ecstasy say that it
makes them feel closer to other people and puts them more in touch
with their emotions. One psychotherapist described it as
``penicillin for the soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Ecstasy is a hybrid of the stimulant methamphetamine and the
hallucinogen mescaline. It was synthesized more than 80 years ago
as an appetite suppressant, and became popular as a street drug in
the 1970s and early '80s. The compound was banned in 1985 by the
Drug Enforcement Administration after truck drivers began using it
as a stimulant.
</P>
<P>
   Ecstasy still has a following in the all-night club scene and is
valued by some psychotherapists, who say it helps break down
psychological barriers.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published in the medical journal Lancet, lends
support to earlier work by the Johns Hopkins team, which found
evidence of damage to serotonin nerve endings in primates and other
animals given doses of ecstasy equivalent to those taken by some
humans, when differences in body mass and other factors are taken
into account, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Subjects in the study were screened to make sure they had not
used other drugs, like marijuana, cocaine and barbiturates, that
could affect the results in the period immediately before the
study.
</P>
<P>
   The study's results leave open the question of whether the
damage from MDMA is reversible in humans. In studies in baboons,
brain alterations triggered by ecstasy were still present a year
after the animals were given the drug.
</P>
<P>
   The study offers ``a warning that this kind of drug use can
produce long-lasting abnormalities in the brain,'' said Dr. John
Mann, a Columbia University psychiatrist and chief of neuroscience
at the New York State Psychiatric Institute. ``People take a lot of
stuff that affects their brains thinking that it's harmless, and it
might not be.''

 &HT;    No clues found to explain plane's fatal fall
 &HT;    WITH PLANE-PILOT
 &HT;    By Brad Schrade and Scott Marshall
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With darkness setting in, pilot Laurie Ewald was 5,000
above metro Atlanta when things began to go horribly wrong.
Aviation investigators today will begin dissecting the engine of
Ewald's Piper Lance plane to try to determine why her flight ended
in a fiery crash on Ga. 400 that killed a man in his car.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators could find nothing Thursday in their initial
examination of the mangled, charred wreckage of the single-engine
plane to indicate why it went down during Wednesday's rush hour,
said Preston Hicks, an investigator with the National
Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   Srinivas Alugupalli, 31, of Atlanta, was killed when Ewald's
plane fell from the sky, sliding into his Mazda 626 in a fiery
explosion. He was driving south.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks listened Thursday to the tape of Ewald's final minutes of
the flight. At 6:17 p.m. she calmly radioed Atlanta air traffic
controllers with a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Her oil pressure was dropping and she was losing engine power.
The plane crashed seven minutes later as Ewald was trying to reach
DeKalb-Peachtree Airport for an emergency landing.
</P>
<P>
   ``She indicated she didn't want to land on the interstate
highway,'' Hicks said. ``But it was dark at that time and she was
having difficulty seeing a safer place to land the airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewald, 40, of Hoover, Ala., was recovering from burns to her
hands, arms and upper body Thursday at Grady Memorial Hospital. She
was in satisfactory condition, a spokeswoman said. Hicks hopes to
talk to her today.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board will try to reconstruct
the incident, looking at such details as weather, air-traffic
control data and the plane's final movements, before concluding
what caused the crash. The investigation could take six to seven
months.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators will also look at the maintenance history of the
plane owned by Air Carriers, a Bessemer, Ala. based, air cargo
company. Records show the plane, a 1976 Piper Lance and owned by
Air Carriers Inc., had two ``service difficulty reports'' since
1993.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, a pilot aboard the plane reported low power after a
sudden loud bang shortly after takeoff and then returned safely to
an airport despite having reduced power and ``rough'' engine
performance. The crankshaft was broken, records show.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, a crack was found in the nose-gear of the plane.
Investigators have not concluded whether the maintenance history
contributed to the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Air Carriers has been involved in 10 previous accidents or
incidents since 1994, according to Federal Aviation Administration
records.
</P>
<P>
   Ewald was en route from Bessemer, Ala., to Gainesville to
deliver interoffice mail and financial documents. Her cargo, some
of which was burned, were taken by police for safekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   Ewald was flying north when the problems started. She turned the
plane around in hopes of landing at Peachtree-DeKalb. Her plane
didn't have the power to make it.
</P>
<P>
   It clipped a red Jeep Cherokee, but did not injure its driver.
Then it hit Alugupalli's four-door car beneath the Roberts Drive
overpass, causing an explosion. Investigators discovered his
identity by using a vehicle-identification number on the car, which
was left a paintless, burned-out hulk. Ewald emerged under her own
power from what was left of her plane and into the arms of
bystanders to wait for paramedics.
</P>
<P>
   When Ewald told the man at the control center the plane was
losing altitude and unable to regain enough power, he quickly
called a military C-130 airplane on a routine training mission,
flown by Col. Bill Kane, commander of the air wing at Dobbins Air
Reserve Base.
</P>
<P>
   The C-130 crew, sent to observe the smaller plane's landing or
crash area to direct rescuers, watched from an altitude of about
2,000 feet as Ewald touched down onto Ga. 400 and then scooted
beneath the Roberts Drive overpass and into the collision with the
two cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a circle for a little bit, then, back to our
training,'' Kane said. ``I would certainly express deep condolences
to the person who lost his life on the ground, and I certainly wish
the pilot Godspeed in her recovery.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone
interviews conducted Monday through Wednesday with 1,118 adults
throughout the United States. Of these, 942 said they were
registered to vote.
</P>
<P>
   The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected
by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active
residential exchanges across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a
complete telephone number, thus permitting access to both listed
and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was
designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the
survey.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been weighted to take account of household size
and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for
variations in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race,
age and education.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such
samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in
either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out
all American adults.
</P>
<P>
   For smaller subgroups the potential sampling error is larger.
For example, for 572 ``likely voters'' it is plus or minus four
percentage points. For 400 ``more likely voters'' it is plus or
minus five. Registered voters were categorized as likely (or more
likely) according to their stated intention to vote next week,
their expressed interest in the campaign, and their reported voting
behavior in past elections.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of
conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources
of error into the poll. Variations in wording of questions or in
the order of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat
different results.

   A WORLD CLIMATE GROWING GRADUALLY AND STEADILY WARMER
</P>
<P>
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has compiled a
record of global mean temperatures since the mid-1860s, when the
widespread use of coal and oil, fossil fuels that produce the
greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, was beginning to accelerate with the
Industrial Revolution. These statistics suggest that the Earth has
warmed by about one degree Fahrenheit during that time. Scientists
say the buildup could cause it to warm by several more degrees
during the next century if emissions of greenhouse gases are not
curtailed.

CATALINA ISLAND BUILDS NEW FOOTBALL TRADITIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DALZIEL  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AVALON, Calif. _ Avalon High School sits tucked away in the
hills of this cozy town, just a golf-cart ride from where visitors
frequent shops and restaurants along the Santa Catalina Island
wharf.
</P>
<P>
   Next to the school, wedged between two mountains, is the
football field _ it spreads across a baseball diamond and is only
80 yards long and 40 yards wide.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Avalon football coach Earl Schrader stood in the end
zone during practice, watching his players go through offensive and
defensive plays in the unusually hot and humid October sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what?'' Schrader said. ``They never had football
here. Nothing at all. I was shocked. I couldn't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Football, though, has finally found its way to the island,
located about 26 miles southwest from the port of San Pedro. The
sport is relatively new for the 20 players who have spent most of
their lives in this secluded haven.
</P>
<P>
   Avalon played just five games in the sport's debut last season.
This year, the school joined the Liberty League and scheduled nine
games against better opposition, including a home game Nov. 7 with
Montclair Prep.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids on the island grew up not playing football,'' Avalon
principal Matt Saldana said. ``The only exposure to it has been
watching it on television. A majority of the kids on the team will
have played in a football game before they have physically seen
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Schrader owns a real estate agency in this resort town,
populated by about 3,500 whose primary means of transportation are
motorized golf carts. The 46-year old was the driving force in
bringing football to Avalon High, starting a youth flag-football
program in 1992 and a tackle program in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Saldana moved to Avalon after becoming the
principal, and the two decided to launch a football program for the
high school. When a scrimmage with Long Beach Wilson's freshman
team drew nearly 500 in 1996, Saldana and Schrader were convinced
football was here to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Avalon's football program was built with financial support from
the Long Beach Unified School District, local businesses and
personal donations. ``A lot of people talked about bringing
football here, but it wasn't huge,'' Saldana said. ``It was an easy
decision to make because it's good for the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lancers have taken their lumps this year. Injuries cut the
roster to 17 players, many of whom play both ways, and the team is
winless through its first five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're outsized in every game,'' Schrader said. ``But they just
play tough. We may be small and slow, but we're in shape.''
</P>
<P>
   The slow start hasn't ruined the players' attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of fun out there,'' said first-year
quarterback/free safety Chris Arnold, a senior whose skinny,
6-foot-2, tan frame, no shirt and wavy brown hair makes him look
more surfer than football player. ``I just love it.''
</P>
<P>
   So do the parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really great,'' said Maria Hall, whose son Shawn is an
offensive lineman. ``Sometimes I get worried because he comes home
all bruised up. But I'm glad Shawn's involved.''
</P>
<P>
   George Key of Palos Verdes Estates shows support for the team
because his grandson, Ben Eroen, is a quarterback and safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come to all the games,'' Key said. ``The kids are enjoying
this, and Earl is doing a good job. It's good to have football here
and I think the community is interested and it should grow.''
</P>
<P>
   The student body has also caught football fever. Every Friday
before a Saturday afternoon home game, students and cheerleaders
decorate golf carts in in the school's blue and gold colors and
drive up and down the wharf, honking their horns to publicize the
game. The parade is greeted by both shocked stares and enthusiastic
cheers from onlookers. The cheerleaders perform a routine in the
middle of the wharf, then it's one more time up and down the wharf
and back to campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great,'' Saldana said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Avalon is also getting praise from opposing football coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what,'' said coach Darin Parson, after his
Cabrillo High team beat Avalon 27-9, ``I'm very impressed with the
way Avalon played. They are super-tough and gave us a lot of
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation for Avalon's football program was set this
season, and Schrader hinted the Lancers might soon move to
eight-man football. He knows, given time, the island community will
establish a football tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel it's going to take about five years to really
develop,'' he said. ``Once we get the kids' brothers through here
and they see what to expect, it will just take off from there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's improved 100 percent compared to last year in terms of
attitude and commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because these 20 pioneers are serious about football, no
matter how little experience they have. Eroen, a junior and one of
the team &UR;  &LR; leaders despite having &UR;  &LR; played only a year of tackle
football, summed it up best.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might be creating a losing tradition now,'' he said. ``But
we are having fun. We don't think about losing anymore. We are
smaller than all the other teams, and we get physically beat every
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm so proud of this team. We want to do this. We want to
play football.''

   BROWNSVILLE, Texas _ A federal jury Thursday apparently
acquitted a Rio Grande Valley man of conspiring and threatening to
use biological weapons against President Clinton and other
officials, but deliberations continued on the fate of two other
defendants.
</P>
<P>
   After eight hours of deliberations, U.S. District Judge Hilda
Tagle accepted the jury's partial verdict as to Oliver Dean Emigh,
a 63-year-old appliance repairman. She immediately sealed the
verdict and ordered the jury to continue deliberating the fate of
Emigh's co-defendants, Johnie Wise, 72, and Jack Abbott Grebe Jr.,
43.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors were sent home late Thursday night and will resume
deliberations Friday.
</P>
<P>
   While the judge did not announce the verdict on Emigh, she
released him from custody Thursday evening. Defense attorneys and
Wise and Grebe congratulated Emigh, who broke into a gigantic
smile. Emigh also shook prosecutors' hands and they congratulated
him.
</P>
<P>
   Emigh, who has been jailed along with his co-defendants since
their July 1 arrests, declined to comment on the verdict, saying
only, ``I'm trying to get over this whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The three men, who have ties to the Republic of Texas separatist
movement, were arrested by FBI agents who had secretly taped their
conversations with an informant. Prosecutors contend FBI agents
aborted a bizarre plot by the men to further their anti-government
cause by threatening to infect Clinton, federal and state officials
and their families with biological agents such as rabies, botulism
and the HIV virus. The men allegedly planned to use a modified
cigarette lighter to propel a cactus thorn dipped in the biological
poisons.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Mervyn Mosbaker told the jury in final
arguments Wednesday that the evidence was overwhelming that the
three engaged in a ``sinister, nefarious scheme to kill people.''
</P>
<P>
   FBI informant John L. Cain, had testified in the two-week trial
that Grebe and Wise approached him and laid out their plot. The
most damaging government evidence was a black-and-white FBI
surveillance video taken in Cain's trailer home on June 26. In it,
Wise and Grebe could be seen sipping homemade wine and instructing
Cain to send e-mail threats to Clinton, Attorney General Janet Reno
and a host of other federal and state officials.
</P>
<P>
   While federal prosecutors said Cain was merely doing the
defendants' bidding, defense attorneys excoriated the self-employed
computer consultant who they insist entrapped the trio in order to
collect $18,000 in payments from the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys portrayed their clients as harmless retirees
who liked to sit around, drink home brew and exercise their right
to criticize the government.
</P>
<P>
   Felix Recio, who defended Emigh, told the jury to recall Cain's
video-taped efforts to move the plot along, and compared the
informant to a movie director. ``If this was a movie, the billboard
would be Cecil B. DeCain directs Grumpy Old Men, Part Three.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Herink, who is Grebe's attorney, ridiculed the weapon system
the government claimed the men would use. The device was only
referred to the tape recordings, but Cain told the jury Wise
planned to use a modified cigarette lighter to propel a cactus
thorn dipped in homemade poison or viral agents.
</P>
<P>
   Herink said it was ``scary'' the way the government assembled a
case against men who had neither the training nor the intent to
harm anyone with biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about people sitting around drinking beer and shooting
the breeze. Think about someone wearing a secret tape recorder,''
Herink told jurors, suggesting that innocent conversations could be
taken out of context. ``Is this the way we want the FBI and the
government to spend their time, fabricating cases?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can take John Cain and his deceiving, lying testimony and
you can kick it out of this case, and when you do, the government
has absolutely, positively nothing.'' said Keith Uhles, who
defended Wise.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutor Mosbaker countered that there was plenty of
evidence, including a lengthy ``Declaration of War'' authored by
Emigh and a follow-up e-mail threat he said was produced by Grebe.
He said that besides threatening federal officials, the defendants
were willing to infect a Brownsville judge because they didn't like
the way she treated Republic of Texas members in her court.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was reason enought to infect her with the rabies virus,
with a cactus needle, and watch her die like a dog,'' Mosbacker
said, his voice rising in anger. ``That's the kind of people we're
dealing with, people who will go to that extent to make a political
statement.'' &QL;

   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ Hitching a rhetorical ride on John
Glenn's inspiring voyage into space, President Clinton Thursday bid
the 77-year-old senator a safe journey and extolled the earthbound
benefits of America's space program.
</P>
<P>
   The president declared Thursday's launching of the space shuttle
Discovery ``a great day for America, a great day for our senior
citizens.'' He said he was ``absolutely thrilled'' by the spectacle
of the liftoff _ the first witnessed by an American president since
1969 _ and described himself as ``like a kid at his first
Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who was accompanied to the Kennedy Space Center by
Hillary Rodham Clinton, the first lady, said he had nothing to do
with the decision to allow Glenn to take to the heavens 36 years
after his first orbital flight. ``I think the American people
should know that the decision to send him was made strictly by the
book,'' Clinton said. ``I had no role in it.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said that Glenn deserved the return trip. ``And, goodness
knows, for a lifetime of service to us in the air and on the
ground, he's earned this chance,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has significantly refocused NASA since taking
office in 1993 by challenging it to do more with less money, said
the principal benefits of space exploration were discoveries with
commercial applications on Earth. He cited advances in science,
medicine and the environment made possible by experiments in space.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the shimmering rocket bearing Glenn and six other
astronauts lifted off, Clinton used the occasion to try to boost
voter participation in Tuesday's midterm election. Political
analysts believe that turnout will determine Democratic prospects
in elections for Congress and many statehouses.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a question from Walter Cronkite, who was narrating
the launching for CNN, Clinton said he wanted to avoid politics, at
least until attending two political fund-raisers for Florida
Democrats Thursday night in Palm Beach. But he called the space
flight a triumph of American democracy and said, ``So if you feel
patriotic when you see John Glenn and the others go up in space
today, then keep that patriotic feeling until next Tuesday and go
and vote for the candidate and the programs and the issues of your
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was the first president to attend a space launching
since President Nixon and his wife, Pat, watched the liftoff of
Apollo 12 in November 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Discovery's launching with Clinton and the first lady
from the roof of the Launch Control Center were Col. Robert Cabana
of the Marine Corps, who will command the first U.S. mission of the
international space center program, and Lt. Col. Eileen Collins,
the Air Force officer who is scheduled to become the first woman to
command a space shuttle mission next March.
</P>
<P>
   The launching also was seen by 27 senators, 13 House members and
dozens of other dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary, said the Clintons
were ``absolutely speechless'' for a minute and a half after
watching Discovery ride a ribbon of fire into space.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night in Palm Springs, Clinton spoke at a reception for
Rep. Peter Deutsch that was expected to raise $200,000, then
appeared at a dinner expected to yield $300,000 for Lt. Gov. Buddy
MacKay, a candidate for governor.

 &HT;    Media turnout for Discovery mission may be a record high
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. _ John Glenn's nostalgia-rich return
to space on Thursday prompted possibly the biggest news media
turnout in the history of manned space flight.
</P>
<P>
   About 4,000 news people pre-registered for press credentials
here, and NASA spokesman Bruce Buckingham estimated 3,000 news
people were on the scene by the time Discovery lifted off. TV
trucks and trailers turned the press site's parking lot and part of
a once-grassy field into a high-tech mobile home park.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Apollo 11's launch in 1969 generated 3,497 press
requests, with 2,700 actually covering the launch. The biggest
turnout on record was the first space shuttle launch in 1981, which
drew 2,707 reporters, photographers and support crews, according to
the space agency.
</P>
<P>
   But the 77-year-old space pioneer was not the only reason for
the intense interest by the news media. With Tuesday's election
looming, the press site was awash in politicians, and even
President Clinton flew in to watch Glenn rocket back into orbit.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 Spanish news people covered the launch _ not Glenn's,
but that of Mission Specialist Pedro Duque, who became the first
Spanish citizen to fly in space. Duque is an astronaut for the
European Space Agency, of which Spain is a member.
</P>
<P>
   With Thursday's launch, Duque became to Spain what Glenn was to
the United States when he made his first flight in 1962, said
Consuelo Ortega, a reporter for the national TV service Tele 5 in
Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very important. He's a hero,'' she said. Besides Spanish
reporters in U.S. bureaus, about 20 came from Spain to cover the
launch, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Shoko Yamamoto, a spokeswoman for the National Space Development
Agency of Japan, said her nation has a heightened interest in the
flight because payload specialist Chiaki Mukai, a medical doctor,
is Japan's first female astronaut. This is her second space flight.
</P>
<P>
   The international nature of this mission spurred the French news
service Agence France-Presse to send its Washington, D.C.-based
science correspondent Guy Clavel to the launch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't come here regularly,'' he said. ``This is exceptional.
The main story is of course Glenn, because he's a unique man. It's
a unique situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn is the overwhelming reason for the intense American news
coverage, from CNN to Lester Gingold, 76-year-old publisher of The
Best Times, a magazine for ``active mature Memphians'' in
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Gingold said his interest stemmed from ``the fact that a
77-year-old man can go into space and I can vicariously go with
him, and what I believe is the important scientific research in the
field of aging'' that Glenn is to do.
</P>
<P>
   Space launches aren't new to science journalist Andrew Chaikin,
author of A Man on the Moon, a history of the Apollo program.
Chaikin said he watched the last moon mission, Apollo 17, blast off
in December 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, he thought this mission was worth witnessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be here for the history of it,'' he said.

 &HT;    On this side of heaven, Glenn's buddy couldn't be happier for
him
 &HT;    By Scott Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ Sen. John Glenn's old war buddy, the
retired Marine general, did no better than anyone in resisting the
emotional power of watching Glenn realize a lifelong dream of
returning to space.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Tom Miller, who had to watch Glenn's first ``space
shot'' on a television set, saw this liftoff from a VIP site for
astronaut friends just a few miles from the pad. While others
cheered and clapped, Miller said he didn't breathe a word as the
rockets fired and the shuttle rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I uttered a sound, because I was so intent on
watching,'' said Miller, who lives in Arlington, Va. ``I was just
listening to every pop of the engine, listening for anything
different. But I probably had a tear or two.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller met Glenn in flight school 50 years ago, and since then
the two have remained close friends. While in Florida, Miller is
staying on the boat he and his wife co-own with the Glenns. It's
named Seniram, which is Marines spelled backwards. Miller saw Glenn
the evening before the launch in a special visit that kept
astronauts and friends separated by a ditch to avoid the chance of
infecting the shuttle flyers just as they head into space.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen him in better spirits,'' Miller said. ``I
think it's so doggone wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   The Millers and the Glenn family went to dinner after the
launch, marking a reunion of sorts for the two clans. Over the
years, the two families became close and their children played
together because Tom Miller and John Glenn were stationed near one
another over and over. Eventually, they both landed jobs in
Washington and bought side-by-side lots in the suburb of Arlington.
It was from this Arlington house that Mrs. Glenn and the children,
then teenagers, now adults, watched the Mercury flight on
televisions in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, the Glenns moved, but the Millers stayed. The
kids hadn't been in touch in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be real nice,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller has seen several shuttle launches, but he's never felt
this kind of satisfaction for one. He was with Glenn in the
earliest days of the Mercury astronaut program when NASA chose to
fly Alan Shepard instead of Glenn first, and through to the last
Mercury days when Glenn became the only one of the original seven
not to get a second space flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't be happier the way everything went,'' he said.
``He's back and I just feel so happy for him. He's in living heaven
right now.''

 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Brazil is the bailout of the month, and Stanley
Fischer, the closest thing the world economy has to a battlefield
medic, is a blur of cell-phone calls and urgent e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   From the hushed executive floor of the International Monetary
Fund, where he reigns as the No. 2 official, from his car and from
the airplanes he is always rushing to catch, Fischer has been
engaged in a constant negotiation with Brazilian Finance Minister
Pedro Malan. They have tangled over just how to cut the Brazilian
budget, raise taxes and deal with an overvalued currency even as
they are united in their determination that Brazil's unpredictable
and sometimes recalcitrant Congress buy the deal the government
made public this week.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Fischer has been involved in an equally complex
byplay with U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, who is
trying to persuade the IMF to contribute more to Brazil's cause _
to have a better shot at stabilizing the country and to assurethat
the United States will have to put up less money of its own. The
IMF will contribute at least $15 billion and the United States is
expected to throw in between $3 and $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   As Fischer, a 55-year-old former professor of economics from
MIT, performs this political and economic highwire act, he is,
typically, keeping his own counsel.
</P>
<P>
   But hovering over his every calculation is the knowledge that
the IMF cannot afford another failure. Another Russia or another
Indonesia would be a disaster, not just for the IMF but for the
world economy, too. If what he delicately calls the ``Brazil
stabilization plan'' fails to stabilize Brazil, once again the
institution that was designed to bring order to the world economy
will be accused of fueling the disorder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I know we've become everyone's favorite whipping boy,''
Fischer, whose formal title is first deputy managing director of
the IMF, mused one summer afternoon, when Moscow's troubles
dominated the day and Brazil's were still germinating. ``But
remember that in most cases governments call us in only after they
discover they are in a mess, usually because they didn't do things
they needed to do long ago. If the problems were easy to solve,
they'd do it themselves. And it's our job to convince people to do
things that we believe, and they probably know, are good for them.
Even if those things are politically unpopular _ and they usually
are.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Fischer coaxes along crisis-wracked politicians from
Brasilia to Moscow to Seoul, he is also fighting a rearguard action
against the traditions of the IMF, and against the institution's
legions of critics.
</P>
<P>
   He is trying to reinvigorate a tradition-bound, often
narrow-minded bureaucracy that has never quite adjusted to a world
of 24-hour markets and has proven astoundingly ill-prepared for the
challenge of designing economic plans that will fit the political
realities of the countries where the IMF is sent in as the lender
of last resort.
</P>
<P>
   But while he tries to change the fund from the inside he is also
defending it against outsiders _ other economists, members of
Congress, even ostensible colleagues across the street at the IMF's
sister institution, the World Bank. Few of the critics agree with
each other about what the fund should have done differently. But
each is certain that it has been wrongheaded, insensitive, beholden
to big bankers and prone to make its patients sicker.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer is lucky: Most of the public heat for the IMF's
prescriptions are directed at his boss, managing director Michel
Camdessus, who spends much of his time dealing with presidents and
prime ministers.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to the hard bargaining, negotiating the
programs countries promise to carry out in return for the IMF's
help, it is Fischer who signs off on the details. He cuts the deals
over how much countries must rein in their spending, how they will
arrange to collect extra taxes, what kind of pet projects they must
kill, and how they should attack crony capitalism and corruption.
Just how much power he holds is a matter of debate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Finance ministers around the world claim that Fischer is the
first button on their speed-dialers. This summer, as the IMF team
was working out the final details of what turned out to be a
doomed-from-the-start deal with Russia, Fischer conducted the final
talks from a cell phone as he stood atop a sand dune on Martha's
Vineyard, Mass., where he was on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like a bad scene out of `Lawrence of Arabia,''' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF's critics insist that Fischer's power is overstated. To
them, he seems to mostly do the bidding of the United States. He
was put in his job four years ago, chiefly because of U.S.
influence, suggested for the job by Summers, who clearly sought a
like-minded economist for the post.
</P>
<P>
   But as the United States, the largest power in the fund,
intercedes in the biggest bailouts, there is also some tension in
the relationship. ``It's fair to say,'' one senior U.S. official
noted this summer, as tempers rose over how to deal with the
financial collapse of Russia, ``that Stan is getting a little tired
of us.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Others say that Fischer struggles to work within the confines of
Camdessus' IMF. ``A complete French bureaucracy,'' one official at
the neighboring World Bank calls it. Fischer has tried to
invigorate that bureaucracy, pushing its staff, long accustomed to
leisurely reviews of the state of national economies, to stay more
on top of developments. They drew the line, though, at wearing
beepers.
</P>
<P>
   He has tried to convince the IMF to monitor markets and
political developments around the clock _ much as the U.S. Treasury
does _ rather than simply lock all the doors of its headquarters at
nights and on weekends. According to IMF lore, at least one
desperate Asian finance minister, in the midst of a currency
crisis, found himself explaining his problems to a security guard,
who was the only person at the IMF to answer the phone at night. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Fischer has also directly taken on the IMF's critics, most
recently in an unusual essay in The Economist, explaining the
rationale behind the fund's more controversial bailouts. In
speeches he has even admitted to occasional self-doubts about
whether the fund's approach was always right, sentiments rarely
heard from Camdessus. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way I know how to do this job is to read the
criticisms, many of them by my former colleagues, and then ask the
question `Are these guys right?''' Fischer said recently. ``If the
answer is yes, you adjust.''
</P>
<P>
   The adjustments have been particularly visible in Indonesia,
where, stung by the criticism that it was punishing 100 million
desperately poor people to pay for the sins of a handful of
extraordinarily rich bankers, the fund is now relaxing the
austerity measures to allow the government to spend more on food
subsidies and dropping its demands that the food distribution
monopoly be broken up.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the harshest critics of the IMF's approach give
credit to Fischer for changing course _ at least a few degrees _
once he recognized that the fund's traditional remedies were
failing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't escape blame for some of the fund's blunders,'' says
a longtime friend, Allen Sinai, the chief economist of Primark
Decision Economics. ``But he is more flexible, more balanced, more
able to walk a delicate line between the IMF's principles and what
will actually work politically than anyone I've ever seen over
there.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fischer is the first to defend the IMF's orthodoxy over the last
16 months of turmoil. The best way to get a country back on its
feet, he says, is to put a stop to wild government overspending and
to pump up interest rates to prevent currency devaluations.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer says that the passage of time is proving that his
formulas can work. ``When we were called into Korea they were
essentially out of resources,'' he said. ``Now, in Korea and
Thailand, stabilization of the currencies has clearly succeeded. We
expected that if the currencies stabilized, interest rates would
come back down. And that's exactly what has happened. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did we focus so much on stabilizing the currencies?'' he
asked rhetorically. ``Because if you do not, you get a takeoff of
inflation.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Within the IMF pantheon, Thailand and South Korea are emerging
as success stories. Even there, however, Fischer cannot escape the
critics who argue that those same high interest rates choked off
growth and fostered unnecessarily severe recessions.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Jeffrey Sachs, the Harvard professor and a strong
critic of the IMF, contended that the fund was about to make the
same mistake again in Brazil. ``The budget cuts and those high
interest rates are going to send Brazil into a very deep
recession,'' he said. Sachs advocates letting the Brazilian
currency float, a path Fischer has rejected as too likely to
encourage a price spiral.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer's closest friend in economics, Rudiger Dornbusch, who
wrote a textbook with him, has offered an alternative. Brazil
should adopt a currency board, which would require the country to
keep huge foreign reserves on hand to fix the real, the Brazilian
currency, against the dollar. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is no surprise that Fischer is attuned first and foremost to
the dangers of hyperinflation. He made his name in academia, and
his debut as a global economic player, fighting it. But it was a
circuitous path that began in Northern Rhodesia _ now Zambia _
where his father, a merchant, was an immigrant from Latvia and his
mother an immigrant from Lithuania. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A British education in Rhodesia led him to the London School of
Economics, then the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he
earned his Ph.D., before going on to the University of Chicago at
the end of Milton Friedman's era. ``At MIT you did the mathematical
work,'' he said, ``and at Chicago you asked the question of how
this applies to the real world.''
</P>
<P>
   Summers dates his first encounters with Fischer as a student of
his at MIT. ``I think I was auditing, so he didn't have to grade
me,'' Summers said, recalling that ``he was a first-rate
macroeconomic theorist who stayed first rate as his interests
became more applied and policy-oriented.''
</P>
<P>
   Fischer was pushed into that transition by George Schultz, the
secretary of state during most of the Reagan administration. In the
mid-1980s, Schultz was trying to figure out how to halt
hyperinflation in Israel. With the analytical help of Fischer and
Herbert Stein, a former chairman of the President's Council of
Economic Advisers, Schultz did to Israel what the IMF does to many
countries today: He presented a painful plan for straightening out
the economy, with the promise that aid could follow. ``Stan did a
remarkable job with it,'' Schultz remembered a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   That dip into public policy hooked Fischer forever. He went to
the World Bank as chief economist and, after returning to MIT for
several years, moved to the IMF &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But today even Schultz has parted ways with Fischer by leading a
drive to abolish the IMF. (He stopped short of repeating that call
a few weeks ago, however, when he was on a panel with Fischer.)  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the current occupant of Fischer's old job at the
World Bank, Joseph Stiglitz, has been among the IMF's fiercest
critics. Stiglitz complains that the fund has ignored the social
impact of its austerity programs and has pushed countries to open
their markets too quickly. Far more gently _ at least in public _
World Bank president James Wolfensohn has joined in the carping.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that this conflict has surfaced, and at times
it has made things difficult,'' Fischer said. ``But the fact is
that we have adjusted as the situation has changed, and as the
crisis got worse than we expected.''
</P>
<P>
   The justification for the coming Brazil package _ more than $30
billion in all _ is finally to get a step ahead of the crisis, to
inject money and reforms before the country's reserves are depleted
and its last investors have fled. Fischer, though, is seared by the
experience in Russia, and wants to gauge how sincere the Brazilians
are about carrying through on their belt-tightening before he sends
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Stan learned in Russia,'' one of his colleagues said,
``is that you can look pretty foolish if you mail the check and
then the legislature rejects the reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fischer seems to hint in his speeches these days that the
IMF may have little choice: If it can't stop the global economic
contagion soon, it is unclear where or when it will stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have to deal with a crisis in Latin America,'' he said
a week ago, ``and most of all, in Brazil. It is a difficult time,
but not impossible by any means.''

TWO ADMIRING TEDS AMONG THRONG WITNESSING HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ Ted Williams got to know John Glenn as a
fellow Marine in Korea. Edward M. Kennedy got to know him as a
fellow senator in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Both Boston Teds came here Thursday to pay tribute to the fellow
they didn't know: John Glenn, pioneer in space.
</P>
<P>
   Williams and Kennedy, both witnessing their first space launch,
joined the festivities and a crowd estimated as large as 1 million
people to see Glenn achieve a dream he had nursed through the
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers included President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton;
huge delegations from Washington and Glenn's home state of Ohio;
families who camped in nearby parks; and Florida schoolchildren
given permission to play hooky.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the earthbound stars like actors Leonardo
DiCaprio and Bruce Willis, heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield,
and singer Jimmy Buffett, who was on hand to cover the event for
Rolling Stone. There also were media stars including Walter
Cronkite, the former voice of CBS who was working Thursday for CNN,
as well as NBC's Tom Brokaw and Katie Couric, and Dan Rather of
CBS. Almost anyone who ever slipped into a NASA flight suit was
also on hand, many doing TV commentary, including Project Mercury
originals Scott Carpenter, Gordon Cooper and Walter Schirra.
</P>
<P>
   Few went as far back with Glenn as Williams, who said he first
met Glenn during the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never admired anybody more than John Glenn,'' said Williams,
wearing a red cap with the insignia VMF-311, signifying the Marine
squadron in which he served as a wingman and Glenn served as a
fighter pilot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's terrific in every way. He is a sensational American
hero,'' added Williams, who made the 100-mile trip with his son,
John Henry.
</P>
<P>
   For Kennedy, it was not only his first launch, it also was his
first trip to the space center named for his slain brother John. He
brought along his wife Vicki, niece Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg,
her daughter Rose, and his stepchildren Caroline and Curran.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts senator said Glenn, a Senate colleague since
1974 and a friend for nearly as long, personified the vibrant older
American, ``still striving, still seeking, never giving in, always
going farther.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy downplayed reports that his brother John quashed Glenn's
earlier dreams of a return to space out of fear that an accident
involving a national hero would carry too high a political price.
But then he added, ``It wouldn't have been an unnatural feeling for
President Kennedy to have had for someone so important to
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the gated confines of the Kennedy Space Center, crowds
leapt for joy, pumped their fists and cheered ``Go, go, go!'' at
the site of the shuttle rising over the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like Woodstock, but for old people,'' said Don
Luetski, 71, of Deerpoint, Mich. ``And,'' he added, ``without all
that rock music.''
</P>
<P>
   At Riverside Presbyterian Church, where Glenn worshiped as a
Project Mercury astronaut 36 years ago, sometimes lingering after
services to autograph Bibles, the staff closed shop and walked to
the nearby beach to watch him fly.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Pelzman returned to the same spot on Cocoa Beach where as
an 8-year-old she watched Glenn's first launch in 1962. This time,
she brought her 9-year-old son, Mikel. ``I just wanted him to share
what was a real special time in my life,'' said Pelzman, carrying a
small American flag like the one she had waved at Glenn's inaugural
flight.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Morgan, mayor of Cocoa Beach, used to run errands for
astronauts and their families as a young Rockwell North American
executive in 1962. He said the launch reminded him of old times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran into (astronaut) Wally Schirra at Alma's last night,''
Morgan said of a local restaurant. ``The astronauts used to like
that place because it only had candlelight. They could meet someone
for dinner without having to worry about being bothered.''

INDONESIAN ARMY PULLBACK IN EAST TIMOR DISPUTED BY LEAKED REPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Opponents of Indonesia's control over the
disputed territory of East Timor said Thursday that documents
leaked from the Indonesian Ministry of Defense show that the army
is not drawing down its forces in the territory as the government
has reported.
</P>
<P>
   The documents date from August, and the situation might have
changed since then. Indonesia's foreign minister, Ali Alatas, has
said several times in recent weeks that Indonesia stood by its
pledge to keep combat forces out of the territory.
</P>
<P>
   But the documents show a total of more than 12,000 Indonesian
troops assigned to East Timor, twice the number of soldiers that
Indonesia says are based there.
</P>
<P>
   They also show that the Indonesian army, known by its Indonesian
acronym Abri, counts among its numbers the members of pro-Jakarta
local youth groups, militias and public officials with ties to the
army. In the past the Indonesian government has always described
these groups as spontaneous organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The military documents put the number of people in these groups
at 9,000, bringing the total military presence to more than 21,000.
</P>
<P>
   A series of Indonesian army tables and charts were made
available to The New York Times by the East Timor Action Network, a
group that supports independence for the territory. Human rights
groups say they believe the documents are authentic. The East Timor
Action Network plans to make the documents public on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975, a year after the former
Portuguese colony was abandoned by Lisbon. The documents cover a
period of nine months that ended in August of this year, when a new
Indonesian government announced that it had withdrawn more than
1,000 combat troops, and said that only about 6,000 defense forces
remained. None of the leaked documents track how figures may have
changed since then.
</P>
<P>
   Alatas, the foreign minister, is taking part in discussions with
the Portuguese under U.N. auspices over the future of East Timor,
which Lisbon and Jakarta agree should be given a large measure of
autonomy. The political opening provided by President B.J. Habibie,
who took over after the fall of President Suharto in May, has
resulted in rising tensions in the territory, and with them reports
of new Indonesian military movements.
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Jones, executive director of Human Rights Watch Asia,
said in an interview in New York on Thursday that an increased
atmosphere of openness since May has emboldened independence forces
among the territory's 800,000 people, where calls for a referendum
on the region's future are heard more often.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is saying that it is going to give wide-ranging
autonomy to East Timor,'' Ms. Jones said in New York. ``But at the
same time it is beginning to use the term autonomy as synonymous
with pro-integration, because autonomy means that you accept
Indonesian sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The resistance and pro-independence forces in East Timor are
not only making themselves much more visible than ever before but
also challenging that concept of autonomy much more openly than
ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So what used to be the clash between the pro-integration and
anti-integration forces has become widespread tension as a result
of differences over support for a referendum _ which is clearly the
popular option _ and support for autonomy, which is clearly the
government position,'' Ms. Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a State Department official said that the United
States has not been able to confirm reports that more Indonesian
troops are going to East Timor, but that it has also not been able
to verify how many were withdrawn in the summer. ``How you count
people makes a big difference,'' the official said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   George Aditjondro, an Indonesian human rights activist who
teaches the sociology of corruption at Newcastle University in
Australia, where he has documented the wealth of the Suharto
family, said on Thursday that he is certain that ``the documents
came from Cilangkap, Indonesia's Pentagon,'' and that they are very
revealing because of how they count people.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tell us that the number of soldiers in the field is
nearly twice the number officially mentioned,'' he said in a
telephone interview from Chicago, where he is attending a
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second thing is that maybe these are the first documents
that put the paramilitary units, the counterinsurgency units, on
Abri's payroll,'' Aditjondro said. ``The government previously
called them spontaneous youth groups wanting to defend the
integration of East Timor.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the documents show that ``the presence of the
Indonesian state in East Timor is heavily militarized.''

BRAZILIAN ECONOMIC PLAN ENCOUNTERS SOME NAYSAYERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BRAZIL-FISCHER) 
(bl) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASILIA, Brazil _ The government's $23.5 billion austerity
package intended to reduce the budget deficit next year, crucial
for securing International Monetary Fund credit and restoring
Brazil's fiscal credibility, moved to Congress here Thursday, where
reaction foreshadowed bitter political wrangling to come.
</P>
<P>
   While most legislators embraced the need for the savings, they
contested the formula that the government announced Wednesday,
which relies on tax increases and pension payments from workers to
meet more than half the promised amount. The program also does not
include a currency devaluation, which could stimulate growth and
tax receipts but also increase inflation and force smaller Latin
American countries to devalue as well.
</P>
<P>
   For four hours Thursday, Finance Minister Pedro Malan and
Central Bank president Gustavo Franco fielded questions and
criticism from senators, many belonging to President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso's party or to allied parties in the governing
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Investors appeared wary of government promises, and Brazil's
benchmark stock index closed down 4.2 percent on a day on which
most other Latin American markets rose. Paulo Mallman, an economist
with Bic Banco in Sao Paulo, predicted that the government would
deliver its promised savings, but added that negotiations toward
reaching that would be ``slower and more tortured'' than initially
thought.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Gleizer, chief of emerging markets research for Latin
America at CSFB-Garantia Bank in Sao Paulo, agreed. ``The market is
extremely nervous,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The austerity plan represents Brazil's long-awaited answer to
the battering its finances have taken on world markets since Russia
defaulted on some debts in August, arousing fear that a Brazilian
collapse could cripple other Latin American economies and hurt the
United States, which depends on Latin America to buy more than 20
percent of its exports.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The IMF has been working out a standby loan for Brazil, which is
expected to combine at least $30 billion from the fund and other
lending agencies, as well as a direct contribution from the United
States and other big industrial nations.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's spending cuts are essential to convince the IMF that
the government is serious about austerity, while another element of
the plan _ a timetable for confronting structural economic changes
_ is meant to show that Brazil will use the help to find permanent
solutions to bring public spending in line with revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Because the IMF and Brazil have a history of confrontation and
disappointment in the 1980s, Malan and other officials are playing
down the IMF's importance domestically. Instead, officials are
selling the austerity plan as the only route to restore Brazil's
standing in world markets, and so bring down interest rates that
are choking business.
</P>
<P>
   As a team of Brazilian officials prepared to visit IMF
headquarters in Washington, Malan told Congress, ``Why should the
rest of the world have faith in us if we don't demonstrate faith in
our own ability to identify problems and not only announce
solutions, but carry them out?''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Brazil reacted to the financial collapse in Thailand
by announcing a series of 51 measures to raise $18 billion. Though
Congress passed the measures in record time, the government adopted
only tax increases, and abandoned spending cuts, worsening Brazil's
position when crisis set in again this year.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jeferson Peres, of Cardoso's Brazilian Social Democracy
Party, assailed the administration Thursday, asking, ``Were there
grave mistakes in our economic policy that we made?'' He said the
country's future appeared now to hinge on an IMF endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   The cornerstones of the current austerity package include the
near-doubling of a tax on all checks and financial transactions, to
0.38 percent from 0.20 percent, and the impounding by the national
government of 40 percent of taxes earmarked for states and
municipalities until 2006.
</P>
<P>
   The program also cuts into the interests of Brazil's highly
protected civil service, increasing employees' pension
contributions and calling on retired workers collecting more than
$1,000 a month to pay as much as 20 percent of their benefits back
into the system.
</P>
<P>
   The measures that promised to draw the most resistance appeared
to be the pension changes, and by day's end, many Brazilian
politicians suggested that one of the taxes on financial
transactions was likely to rise less than requested.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition governors gathered at a private club here to chart
their strategy to defeat the extension of the impounding of local
tax revenue, which was to have expired in 1999, and another
proposal that would force states to limit payments to active and
retired civil servants to 60 percent of the budget.
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Paulo da Silva, leader of the biggest union, the Central
Labor Union, called the measures recessionary and said they would
``deepen the country's crisis.'' He pledged that workers would
protest from Nov. 3 to Dec. 10, roughly when Congress is expected
to debate the pension changes.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jader Barbalho, of the government-allied Brazilian
Democratic Movement Party, said that ``in a democracy, nobody has
the monopoly on truth,'' adding that his party would be open to
alternative suggestions for savings, whether they came from the
governing coalition or the opposition.

MARKET PLACE: CBS STOCK RISES ON ENCOURAGING NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fixing CBS Corp. will not be easy. But investors in
the company that owns the storied television network appear to have
faith that Mel Karmazin, the newly chosen chairman and chief
executive, has the ability to do it.
</P>
<P>
   CBS shares jumped 10.3 percent Thursday to $28, the highest
level in six weeks, in the aftermath of the company's announcement
Wednesday that Karmazin, who had been president, would take over as
chairman and chief executive when Michael H. Jordan retires Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Although Karmazin's elevation to the top job wasn't a surprise,
the speed at which he got there was, considering he arrived at CBS
less than two years ago, when CBS acquired his radio broadcasting
company, and considering that Jordan hadn't been expected to retire
for another three years, when he will turn 65.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the rise in the stock at least partly reflected
investor relief that any doubts had now been eliminated about a
successor to Jordan, who led Westinghouse Electric Corp.'s
transformation from industrial conglomerate to media giant with the
purchase of CBS four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Karmazin, 55, is known as an aggressive cost cutter who already
has made his mark on CBS. There also have been rumors that he might
sell the television network, which like some other major networks
has been losing money.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said they did not think a sale was likely, but that did
not preclude a spinoff of the radio station operations. CBS said
Aug. 27 that it planned to sell 20 percent of its radio and
billboard business to the public in a spinoff that would be called
Infinity Broadcasting, the name of the radio company Karmazin sold
to CBS for $3.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am willing to bet on Mel and I think there will be further
restructuring including eventually the complete separation of TV
and radio,'' said Dennis Leibowitz, who follows CBS for Donaldson,
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. ``And Mel has been someone the market is willing
to bet on.''
</P>
<P>
   The impact of Karmazin's management of the company was evident
in CBS' third-quarter earnings, which were announced Thursday and
came in better than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Net losses at the television and radio company fell to $43
million, from $162 million a year earlier. The loss included a $68
million charge to streamline television operations. Revenues for
the entire company jumped 23 percent to $1.58 billion. And earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, an important
measurement of a media company's performance, was a record $268
million, up 25.2 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
   At its radio stations, revenues were up 42 percent to $534
million. That performance was enhanced by the acquisition of
American Radio, which CBS acquired in June of this year.
</P>
<P>
   At the television division, excluding the one-time charge, cash
flow rose 22 percent to $158 million.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in CBS stock still leaves it considerably below its
52-week high of $36.675, reached April 8. But Karmazin's promotion,
coupled with the earnings results Thursday, left analysts more
optimistic than they had been.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``There is a belief that with Mel as chief executive officer,
the network will get to profitability quicker than it would have
otherwise,'' said one analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity.
``I don't think the company is finished making cutbacks, and things
happen faster when Mel is running the show. He is not political; he
just gets things done.''
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts said they believed the pending sale of 20
percent of the radio and billboard business in a stock offering
would enhance the parent company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the radio operations will trade well, and as a result
the market will look at what is left inside CBS and see value,''
one analyst said. ``CBS will still own 80 percent of the radio
operations. If the market values Infinity well, then CBS will trade
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of Wall Street's thinking about media companies these days
has to do with how it sees companies positioned for a recession.
Radio is more dependent on local advertising than on national
advertising, and is expected to hold up well in an economic
slowdown, which is viewed as increasingly likely.
</P>
<P>
   CBS also benefited from political advertising in the quarter,
and Karmazin's costly $4 billion purchase of the rights to
broadcast professional football on Sundays is generating some
payoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Ratings for adults 18 to 49, particularly males, have improved
in prime time. CBS is also challenging NBC for leadership among
total viewers in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is optimistic about Karmazin's ability to turn
around the network, which is now in second place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is much more complicated to run a television network than a
radio company,'' said one media-industry expert, who did not want
to be named. ``You have more constituencies and more problems, and
they are harder to solve. Mel is good at selling and at cost
cutting, but cost cutting can antagonize people and indirectly make
new problems.''

   Work has always been a problem for television.
</P>
<P>
   Remember ``Ozzie and Harriet''? Harriet Nelson was the classic
stay-at-home mom, but nobody ever quite knew what her husband did
for a living.
</P>
<P>
   Situation comedies sometimes filled the void by giving their
stars an easy-to-portray career: being on TV. Recall, if you're old
enough, the ``Jack Benny Show,'' or ``Burns and Allen.''
</P>
<P>
   When TV has depicted more conventional occupations, it has often
chosen the exciting. Police officers, lawyers and physicians litter
the bluish-gray landscape of television history. And while here and
there a psychotherapist or a barkeeper turns up, there are
relatively few CPAs or dentists.
</P>
<P>
   But the new TV season has brought a turning, however slight,
away from the high-profile professions that have been especially
prominent in the '90s in favor of a more workaday world and some
acknowledgments that most people hold regular jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In new shows like ``Jesse'' (about a barmaid who aspires to be a
nurse), ``The King of Queens'' (a deliveryman), ``Southie'' (about
blue-collar Boston) and ``Trinity'' (blue-collar New York), life
has taken a decidedly working-class turn.
</P>
<P>
   Audrey Steele, who ought to know, calls it a minitrend. Ms.
Steele, a senior vice president at Zenith Media Services Inc.,
which buys air time for advertisers, has watched the pilot and
second episode of every new show this fall and has lived to tell
the tale.
</P>
<P>
   She says this year's spate of blue-collar programs is a
departure from shows in which affluent and glamorous characters
live in great places and have few worries about money _ finances
weren't much of a problem in ``Seinfeld,'' for instance.
</P>
<P>
   But in one sense, she says, the trend in the new shows is not
all that new. For despite all the cowboys, doctors and cops,
television has a parallel tradition of showing working men and
women that dates from ``The Honeymooners,'' with its bus driver and
sewer worker and their homemaker wives, and runs through ``All in
the Family,'' ``Sanford and Son,'' ``Taxi,'' ``Married with
Children,'' ``Roseanne'' and even ``The Simpsons.''
</P>
<P>
   But the timing of the proletarian upsurge is interesting.
Television is downshifting as the economy threatens to do likewise.
And as a tinge of blue creeps into TV's collars, a dose of blue is
coloring its characters' situations and their psychology.
</P>
<P>
   New shows like ``Maggie Winters'' and ``Encore! Encore!'' are
built around people who have returned home in defeat from the wider
world.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that television, with its antenna forever riveted to
the Zeitgeist, has detected a kind of prosperity fatigue, a sense
that we're all a little worn out by success, a little worried that
it can't possibly last? Could the direction of the current TV
season, planned months ago, be an early symptom of the economy's
Asian flu?
</P>
<P>
   I am aware of no study of television's effectiveness at this
sort of prognostication, but there is a logic to the idea of TV as
economic indicator. Whether television reflects consumer thinking
or directs it can be argued long and hard, but, whether it's mirror
or lamp, we know it is created by executives striving mightily to
produce programming that is of its time.
</P>
<P>
   Think of your set as an electronic version of a woolly
caterpillar, portending a hard winter.
</P>
<P>
   The new crop of shows includes some focusing on owners as well
as on workers. For connoisseurs of TV culture, the hands-down
winner in this genre has got to be ``Wind on Water,'' with Bo Derek
as the matriarch of a Hawaiian cattle ranch. (``Interesting work if
you can get it,'' Ms. Steele says.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the sniping of critics who see no redeeming value in the
show, it does deal frankly with such important business themes as
cash flow, diversification and corporate succession. In need of
money to support the struggling cattle operation, for instance,
Derek's on-screen sons diversify away from agriculture by competing
on the ``extreme sports'' circuit.
</P>
<P>
   And you thought things were tough in your line of work.

GETTING READY FOR THE SACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Protecting the quarterback is USC's primary goal
against Washington, but in this case, keeping the quarterback
healthy might be more realistic than preventing sacks.
</P>
<P>
   Just listen to what California quarterback Justin Vedder said
after surviving 13 sacks against the Huskies' blitzkrieg attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``That team was out to kill me, to get me out of the game,''
Vedder said. ``There was no doubt about it. They said that to me a
couple times while I was on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   At least with the Trojans, the Huskies would have to knock two
quarterbacks out of the game to significantly diminish the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Seriously, the collision between Washington's swarming defense
and the Trojans' sometimes shaky offensive line figures to be the
key matchup Saturday in a game both teams must win to keep their
bowl hopes alive.
</P>
<P>
   USC ranks ninth in the Pacific-10 Conference _ ahead of only the
aforementioned Cal _ in sacks allowed, with 24 in eight games.
Washington, with it's ``get the quarterback at any cost''
philosophy, leads the conference with 43 sacks in seven games.
Whoever wins this battle should win the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can hold in (the pocket) long enough, you'll make some
plays,'' USC quarterback Mike Van Raaphorst said. ``If you don't do
that, you're in for some punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst knows. Last year he completed five of 18 passes
for 46 yards while under constant harrasment in the Huskies' 27-0
victory in Seattle. But Van Raaphorst didn't come away discouraged
after getting his first taste of the blitz-first defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look back at that game and we had so many opportunities,''
Van Raaphorst said. ``We had chances. We just didn't execute.''
</P>
<P>
   That means the offensive line has to do some blocking. No small
task for what has been USC's most maligned position.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a young group, we've unfortunately given up more sacks,''
offensive line coach Steve Greatwood said. ``I guess it's to be
expected, not accepted. I think we're getting better. It's easy to
heap it on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Greatwood has a point. The offensive line has shown signs of
improvement. The Trojans allowed no sacks against Washington State
two weeks ago and just two sacks last week against Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The line took a big step the last two weeks as far as picking
up blocks,'' right guard Travis Claridge said. ``I think we're
going to be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Claridge has his own theory on how the Trojans can neutralize
Washington's defense. He looked at film of the Huskies' 55-7 loss
to Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nebraska sure tore (them) apart in the run game,'' Claridge
said. ``If we run the ball, we won't have to worry about throwing.
If we do what Nebraska did _ come off the ball, be physical _ it
gives us a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has confused the Trojans' ground game with Nebraska's,
however. In the event USC is unable to run successfully, something
will have to be done to protect the quarterback from the blitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of their sacks come from creating confusion,'' Greatwood
said. ``They give you so many different looks. If we can eliminate
the confusion and pick up the people we're supposed to, we'll be
OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington's defense has become so prolific at applying
pressure, it's nicknamed the Pacific Sack Exchange. Linebacker Todd
Johnson and lineman Jabari Issa each have seven sacks this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys are scary,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said. ``If they
decide to completely come after you, you're going to have a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation might not be as dire as it seems. Washington
cornerback Jermaine Smith has been out with a knee injury the past
four weeks and is considered doubtful. Without him, the Huskies'
secondary is vulnerable. Oregon State walk-on quarterback Jonathan
Smith passed for 469 yards in the Beavers' 35-34 loss to Washington
last week.
</P>
<P>
   The other way to offset the blitz is to have a more-mobile
quarterback. If the line is unable to slow the Huskies, Hackett
might choose to use freshman Carson Palmer instead of Van
Raaphorst. Hackett said he liked the way Palmer moved out of the
pocket against Oregon, and the freshman is more mobile than his
sophomore counterpart. He also might be considered more fearless.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to recall the hardest hit he ever took in a game, Palmer
paused for a moment, then said he couldn't really remember a single
hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't really realize how hard you're getting hit,'' Palmer
said. ``You're thinking about other things during a game.''
</P>
<P>
   USC's offensive line hopes Palmer will still believe that after
Saturday.

 &HT;    `Go, go, go!' crowd cheers as Discovery shoots through sky
 &HT;    By Eliot Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ Although the space ship poised to carry
John Glenn into space for the second time in 36 years was but a
hazy image 15 miles up the Banana River, it drew a ragged
population of admirers to the Bennett Memorial Causeway.
</P>
<P>
   Like Hansel Roten, who watched from his canary yellow recliner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night, my wife told me to take it to the junkyard,'' the
64-year-old retired tree surgeon from North Wilkesboro, N.C. said.
Instead, he tossed it in his pickup truck and brought it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call it the John Glenn chair,'' he drawled, ``and I'm asking
$1,200. Want to put a bid on it?''
</P>
<P>
   In a light heat, broken by cool breezes, the thousands waited
for Discovery to climb into a cloudless sky that was gun-gray
against the waterway, then melted into Columbia blue.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kinney was there, 100 feet from where he'd watched Glenn
take off in 1962. That had been with his first wife. The Mercury
rocket was a lot smaller and not half as loud, and the program's
early failures had everyone a lot more nervous then.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was saying, `Go, go, go,'' Kinney recalled.
</P>
<P>
   People came from Stuart and Clearwater and Plant City; Arkansas
and Iowa and Massachusetts; Holland and England. And, of course,
from Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``They promoted him too much,'' said Frances McDowell, from near
Lima Ohio. ``The other ones (on the crew) should get their
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   She might as well have been talking into the roar of the
shuttle's engines.
</P>
<P>
   E.J. Watson had come down four times before from his Indiana
farm across from Louisville, Ky., only to go home disappointed when
each launch was scrubbed.
</P>
<P>
   Lane Lanhum and his dog Foxy had left his 8-by-4 mile lake 170
miles north of Anchorage, Alaska 2-1/2 weeks ago in his motor home.
He'd gone to Los Angeles and turned left.
</P>
<P>
   Stephan Hambsch had driven his 1971 Volkswagen van from Lake
Tahoe to Vancouver to the Midwest en route, eventually, to college
in New York. Barechested and barefoot, in tousled hair and scraggly
chin growth, with black shades and an open brew at 11 a.m., he had
the look of a young man with the luxury of somewhere to go, just
not right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see so many mountains and pretty countryside,'' he
mused. ``You only get to see one space shuttle.''
</P>
<P>
   There were bikers and soccer moms; people sitting in wheelchairs
or sipping ice tea atop their recreational vehicles. A family from
Michigan pulled the bench seats from their minivan.
</P>
<P>
   Some people came at the last minute. Some pitched tents
Wednesday night and tried to listen more to the lapping waves than
the passing traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Geraldine Eastland, and her son John, had left Americus, Ga., at
2 a.m. and driven six hours straight through.
</P>
<P>
   ``The closer we got, the more excited I got,'' the 68-year-old
widow said. Her son had taken shoe polish and written ``Go John
Go'' on the back glass. ``Now, he meant John Glenn,'' said
Geraldine, as if to make sure which ``John'' she was talking about.
</P>
<P>
   People slathered themselves with sunscreen, sucked on bottled
water, spoonfed their kids cereal or laid them down, exhausted, to
sleep on blankets or in the backs of cars. Some popped Tupperwares
full of potato salad and played bridge. Some searched frantically
for portable toilets; there were none.
</P>
<P>
   They squealed with delight at a dolphin breaking the water and
oohed at a team of skywriting planes that spelled ``God speed John
Glenn and crew.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawkers sold T-shirts, lemonade and boiled peanuts. One car was
draped with, ``Go Glenn and crew. Good luck/God Bless. Sasage(sic),
hot dogs. $1.'' Another car read, ``Jail to the chief,'' but
President Clinton got no closer than when Air Force One floated
over the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Along U.S. 1, near Titusville, Ashley Bell, 7, of Orlando was
asked about nine days in space or one day at Walt Disney World. She
threw her mother an exasperated look and answered, `Disney World.''
But when Discovery soared high above and sound waves shook the
ground she jumped from her lawn chair, wearing a smile as wide as
the Indian River.
</P>
<P>
   On the Bennett Causeway, the crowd grew restless when the launch
was delayed. They counted down with the radios and televisions.
They whooped when they saw a thick stack of flame, then a shiny
jewel trailing a twisted white tail. Then they raced for their cars
to beat the traffic jam; to get home and tell their families all
about it.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the midterm elections just five days away,
Republicans are tamping down expectations that they can expand
their majority to 60 seats in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say that Republicans could still harvest a net gain
of up to four Senate seats but that the party will fall shy of
five. Five is the magic number that would vault Republicans to 60
seats and into the rarefied realm of a filibuster-proof majority in
which they could cut off debate by the Democrats and control the
legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Five democratic senators are perceived to be in varying degrees
of trouble: Carol Moseley-Braun in Illinois, Harry Reid in Nevada,
Russell Feingold in Wisconsin, Barbara Boxer in California and
Ernest Hollings in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   At least one previously endangered Democrat, Patty Murray in
Washington, has moved into the comfortable column, and there are
some indications that Mrs. Boxer and Hollings have been doing
better.
</P>
<P>
   And two Republican incumbents, Alfonse D'Amato in New York and
Lauch Faircloth in North Carolina, are engaged in fierce struggles
to keep their seats. Also, an expected takeover of an open seat in
Kentucky by Rep. Jim Bunning, a Republican, has become a toss-up.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Russell, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial
Committee, said it was predicting a pickup of one to three seats.
To win five, Russell said, ``we'd have to recover every fumble and
intercept every pass, and that's just not the way the game goes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen some movement both ways,'' he said of these final
days but added, ``There is no trend one way or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Like others, he emphasized that the results would depend on
which party was able to motivate more voters to the polls on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster, appeared somewhat more
optimistic. Goeas said he expected the party to pick up three to
five seats. He counted Republican victories in Illinois, Wisconsin
and Kentucky, ``then we move to question marks,'' he said, citing
Nevada, South Carolina and California. ``And the big question marks
are New York and North Carolina,'' he said, where polls show the
races dead even.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who along with his wife has raised millions
of dollars for Rep. Charles Schumer against D'Amato in New York and
for Boxer against Matt Fong in California, declined Thursday to
predict Tuesday's outcome. But he noted that there were ``an
unusually large number of apparently close elections,'' and
suggested that this could bode well for Democrats because
Republicans had spent so much more money.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching 60 seats would be important because Republicans could
squelch Democratic-led debates, control virtually every piece of
legislation and be somewhat more in synch ideologically with the
more conservative House. And if impeachment of Clinton ever reached
the Senate, 60 votes would be that much closer to the 67 needed for
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   But a gain of three seats could still make a decisive difference
on legislation that has stalled for lack of a clear-cut
conservative advantage. The prime example is anti-abortion
legislation. For two years in a row, the Senate has fallen three
votes short of being able to override a Clinton veto on banning a
controversial late-term procedure that opponents call partial-birth
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   All of the Republicans who could take Democratic seats on
Tuesday would bolster the conservatives' edge and provide reliable
anti-abortion votes.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty has been the magic number for cutting off debate in the
Senate only in the last two decades. Since 1975, only the Democrats
have had more than 60 seats, and that was for just one session, in
1977.
</P>
<P>
   Only a month ago, some poll-takers and political analysts
predicted that 60 seats might be achievable for Republicans because
Clinton's troubles had so demoralized Democrats. Now they say that
with impeachment appearing more remote and a more confident
president on the campaign trail, Democratic spirits have somewhat
revived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats decided, `Don't get depressed, get even,' '' said
Celinda Lake, a democratic pollster who had predicted
``disastrous'' results for Senate Democrats. Ms. Lake said core
democratic voters, like African-Americans, could make a difference
in statewide elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've pulled back,'' said Charles Cook Jr., editor of the Cook
Political Report, a nonpartisan election monitor. One month ago,
Cook said a five-seat Republican gain was within reach. ``There's
been some movement away from Republicans,'' he said now, ``and
we're down to one, two or three'' gains for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Stuart Rothenberg, editor of the Rothenberg Political
Report, said, ``The odds favor a Republican net gain of two or
three seats.'' Rothenberg said that they could gain only one or as
many as four, but that five seemed unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Goeas, the Republican pollster, agreed that Democrats appeared
more motivated now. But, he said: ``It's very spotty. You see it in
the Northeast and the Northwest, but not in the Midwest, the Plains
States or the South.'' He also said that while black voters
universally supported Clinton, they would probably not vote in
substantial numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 34 Senate seats on the ballot, 18 are held by Democrats
and 16 by Republicans. Three Democrats and two Republicans are
retiring. These open seats are usually the easiest for the other
party to take over.
</P>
<P>
   One retiring Democrat is Dale Bumpers in Arkansas. Recent polls
put the democratic candidate, Rep. Blanche Lambert Lincoln, ahead
of the Republican, State Sen. Fay Boozman. Abortion has become an
issue there since Boozman said women who had been raped were
unlikely to need abortions because they were so frightened, they
released a hormone, which he called ``God's little protective
shield,'' to prevent pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kentucky seat being vacated by Wendell H. Ford, a
Democrat, Bunning had a strong lead over Rep. Scotty Baesler, a
Democrat. Polls show Bunning's lead less solid now. The highlight
of the race has been a Bunning commercial featuring Richard
Wagner's ``Ride of the Valkyries'' as background to images of a
hyperactive Baesler yelling and pounding the podium. Because Wagner
was Hitler's favorite composer, the Democrats in Kentucky have
branded the commercial ``Naziesque.''
</P>
<P>
   The third seat being vacated by a Democrat is John Glenn's in
Ohio. He is expected to be replaced by a Republican, Gov. George
Voinovich.
</P>
<P>
   The two Republicans retiring are Daniel Coats in Indiana, whose
seat is expected to go to Evan Bayh, a Democrat, and Idaho, where
Dirk Kempthorne is likely to be replaced by a Republican, Rep.
Michael Crapo.

 &HT;    Bush denies that he supports an end to affirmative action
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PENSACOLA, Fla. _ Radio commercials warning black voters that
Jeb Bush would end affirmative action are absolutely untrue Bush
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking aboard one of three motor homes that are part of a
four-day, 23 city campaign trip through Florida, the GOP candidate
for governor said he opposes quotas and minority only contracts but
not affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   In a 60-second radio commercial paid for by the Democratc
campaign of Lt. Gov. Buddy MacKay, a black announcer says,
``imagine a governor who opposes affirmative action.''
</P>
<P>
   Broadcast exclusively on black radio stations such as WPOM in
West Palm Beach, the announcer also says that, ``Jeb Bush stands
for the wealthy and special interests and he's definitely not for
us. Bush would eliminate affirmative action programs that give
African Americans a fair chance to go to college and get a good
job,''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a typical tactic of their's'' Bush said. ``I have
campaigned more in the African American community than my opponent
has. And I have campaigned more in the African American community
than any Republican ever has.''
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Willie Logan, D-Opa-locka, who is campaigning with
Bush said the MacKay ad could have some impact on black voters who
know that in the past the Republican Party has not been friendly to
affirmative action and other issues important to black voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the more sophisticated black voter will know that Jeb
Bush is part of a new group of Republicans who are trying to reach
out to the African American community,'' Logan said.
</P>
<P>
   During stops from Pensacola to Gainesville on the first day of
the campaign tour, Bush was greeted by large, enthusiatic crowds
and news of a poll coming out today that will show him leading
MacKay 53-41 as the campaign goes into its final weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his strong lead, Bush campaigned as if he were losing to
MacKay. Sharply criticizing MacKay, he said at each stop that the
Democrat was running a campaing of ``distortion, divisiveness and
scare tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his unrelenting assault on MacKay, Bush insisted
that it is MacKay who has been running a negative campaign,
``because he has no vision for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not running attack ads like he is,'' said Bush. ``He has
made votes that have had a negative effect on people and we have
pointed those out. It's not my job to point out the good votes he's
made.''
</P>
<P>
   MacKay has been especially critical of the Bush campaign's
attempt to portray MacKay as someone who has voted against Social
Security cost of living increases and other issues important to
seniors. MacKay voted only once, in 1986, for a one year freeze of
cost of living increases in an effort to balance the federal
budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a contact sport,'' Bush said. ``It is competitive. But
what I have said about my illustrious opponent pales by the thing
he has done to me.''

   Q. If meetings didn't already dominate my workday, my company
often organizes food- and drink-filled social events in the
evening. A shy person, I find these after-work gatherings
exhausting, yet realize that failing to attend could hurt my
career. Any survival tips?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Ah, forced bonding with co-workers. Is there any less natural
form of socializing known to mankind? Who really wants to let their
hair down in front of the boss, or the office lecher, or that boor
in the adjoining cubicle who eavesdrops on phone calls? But don't
despair. While shunning such schmooze-fests would indeed be
ill-advised, no one says you have to hang out all night with these
people. You need to learn the sanity-saving art of the tactical
strike: Get in, get around and get out.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's right that she has to attend, but she doesn't have to
stay long,'' said Ronna Lichtenberg, author of ``Work Would be
Great if It Weren't for the People'' (Hyperion, 1998). The key, Ms.
Lichtenberg said, is to get more mileage out of the time you do
spend at the event. Rather than hiding in a corner for hours,
nursing your glass of Merlot, you should grit your teeth and do a
swift round of flesh-pressing. ``Go and work the crowds really
heartily,'' she counseled. ``Spend time with as many people as
possible and look as cheerful as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Those 15 minutes or so of super-schmoozing may be taxing, but
once you've made your presence felt, you are then free to flee.
``The face time is important,'' said Ginny Rehberg, a consultant
with Drake Beam Morin in Boston who specializes in workplace
politics and career issues. ``Ten minutes and you're out of there.
But people think you were there longer because they remember seeing
you.''
</P>
<P>
   When you feel certain that you have kissed enough cheeks and
laughed at enough jokes, check your watch and explain that you,
most regrettably, have another commitment. No one need know that
the commitment may consist of Chinese take-out and reruns of
``E.R.'' Or perhaps you need to spend time with a significant other
or a child _ or a cocker spaniel that needs to be walked.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the reasons may be terribly superficial. But, hey, so are
too many office social events. ``So much of what's going on when
people are asking you to socialize has to do with the appearance of
being part of a team,'' Ms. Rehberg said. By making an effort to
chat with co-workers before disappearing, she said, you send out
the reassuring message that you consider yourself one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Distasteful though it may be, participating in office-bonding
sessions will earn you not only valuable points, but also the right
to bow out of an occasional gathering. If you can predict which
events are likely to be particularly odious (cocktail parties, as
opposed to breakfast meetings; birthday lunches versus picnics),
save up your attendance chits and skip the one or two events a
month that are guaranteed to make your flesh crawl.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the midterm elections just five days away,
Republicans are tamping down expectations that they can expand
their majority to 60 seats in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say that Republicans could still harvest a net gain
of up to four Senate seats but that the party will fall shy of
five. Five is the magic number that would vault Republicans to 60
seats and into the rarefied realm of a filibuster-proof majority in
which they could cut off debate by the Democrats and control the
legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Five democratic senators are perceived to be in varying degrees
of trouble: Carol Moseley-Braun in Illinois, Harry Reid in Nevada,
Russell Feingold in Wisconsin, Barbara Boxer in California and
Ernest Hollings in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   At least one previously endangered Democrat, Patty Murray in
Washington, has moved into the comfortable column, and there are
some indications that Mrs. Boxer and Hollings have been doing
better.
</P>
<P>
   And two Republican incumbents, Alfonse D'Amato in New York and
Lauch Faircloth in North Carolina, are engaged in fierce struggles
to keep their seats. Also, an expected takeover of an open seat in
Kentucky by Rep. Jim Bunning, a Republican, has become a toss-up.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Russell, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial
Committee, said it was predicting a pickup of one to three seats.
To win five, Russell said, ``we'd have to recover every fumble and
intercept every pass, and that's just not the way the game goes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen some movement both ways,'' he said of these final
days but added, ``There is no trend one way or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Like others, he emphasized that the results would depend on
which party was able to motivate more voters to the polls on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster, appeared somewhat more
optimistic. Goeas said he expected the party to pick up three to
five seats. He counted Republican victories in Illinois, Wisconsin
and Kentucky, ``then we move to question marks,'' he said, citing
Nevada, South Carolina and California. ``And the big question marks
are New York and North Carolina,'' he said, where polls show the
races dead even.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who along with his wife has raised millions
of dollars for Rep. Charles Schumer against D'Amato in New York and
for Boxer against Matt Fong in California, declined Thursday to
predict Tuesday's outcome. But he noted that there were ``an
unusually large number of apparently close elections,'' and
suggested that this could bode well for Democrats because
Republicans had spent so much more money.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching 60 seats would be important because Republicans could
squelch Democratic-led debates, control virtually every piece of
legislation and be somewhat more in synch ideologically with the
more conservative House. And if impeachment of Clinton ever reached
the Senate, 60 votes would be that much closer to the 67 needed for
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   But a gain of three seats could still make a decisive difference
on legislation that has stalled for lack of a clear-cut
conservative advantage. The prime example is anti-abortion
legislation. For two years in a row, the Senate has fallen three
votes short of being able to override a Clinton veto on banning a
controversial late-term procedure that opponents call partial-birth
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   All of the Republicans who could take Democratic seats on
Tuesday would bolster the conservatives' edge and provide reliable
anti-abortion votes.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty has been the magic number for cutting off debate in the
Senate only in the last two decades. Since 1975, only the Democrats
have had more than 60 seats, and that was for just one session, in
1977.
</P>
<P>
   Only a month ago, some poll-takers and political analysts
predicted that 60 seats might be achievable for Republicans because
Clinton's troubles had so demoralized Democrats. Now they say that
with impeachment appearing more remote and a more confident
president on the campaign trail, Democratic spirits have somewhat
revived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats decided, `Don't get depressed, get even,' '' said
Celinda Lake, a democratic pollster who had predicted
``disastrous'' results for Senate Democrats. Ms. Lake said core
democratic voters, like African-Americans, could make a difference
in statewide elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've pulled back,'' said Charles Cook Jr., editor of the Cook
Political Report, a nonpartisan election monitor. One month ago,
Cook said a five-seat Republican gain was within reach. ``There's
been some movement away from Republicans,'' he said now, ``and
we're down to one, two or three'' gains for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Stuart Rothenberg, editor of the Rothenberg Political
Report, said, ``The odds favor a Republican net gain of two or
three seats.'' Rothenberg said that they could gain only one or as
many as four, but that five seemed unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Goeas, the Republican pollster, agreed that Democrats appeared
more motivated now. But, he said: ``It's very spotty. You see it in
the Northeast and the Northwest, but not in the Midwest, the Plains
States or the South.'' He also said that while black voters
universally supported Clinton, they would probably not vote in
substantial numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 34 Senate seats on the ballot, 18 are held by Democrats
and 16 by Republicans. Three Democrats and two Republicans are
retiring. These open seats are usually the easiest for the other
party to take over.
</P>
<P>
   One retiring Democrat is Dale Bumpers in Arkansas. Recent polls
put the democratic candidate, Rep. Blanche Lambert Lincoln, ahead
of the Republican, State Sen. Fay Boozman. Abortion has become an
issue there since Boozman said women who had been raped were
unlikely to need abortions because they were so frightened, they
released a hormone, which he called ``God's little protective
shield,'' to prevent pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kentucky seat being vacated by Wendell H. Ford, a
Democrat, Bunning had a strong lead over Rep. Scotty Baesler, a
Democrat. Polls show Bunning's lead less solid now. The highlight
of the race has been a Bunning commercial featuring Richard
Wagner's ``Ride of the Valkyries'' as background to images of a
hyperactive Baesler yelling and pounding the podium. Because Wagner
was Hitler's favorite composer, the Democrats in Kentucky have
branded the commercial ``Naziesque.''
</P>
<P>
   The third seat being vacated by a Democrat is John Glenn's in
Ohio. He is expected to be replaced by a Republican, Gov. George
Voinovich.
</P>
<P>
   The two Republicans retiring are Daniel Coats in Indiana, whose
seat is expected to go to Evan Bayh, a Democrat, and Idaho, where
Dirk Kempthorne is likely to be replaced by a Republican, Rep.
Michael Crapo.

PIONEER ASTRONAUT GLENN, 77, ROCKETS TO ADVENTURE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ With a rousing send-off from thousands of
well-wishers, pioneer U.S. astronaut John Glenn rocketed back into
orbit Thursday at the age of 77, becoming the oldest man to fly in
space.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just going by Hawaii, and that is absolutely
gorgeous,'' Glenn said as the shuttle Discovery settled in for a
nine-day mission, almost 37 years after Glenn took a cramped ride
around the Earth as the first U.S. astronaut in orbit, and returned
to a hero's welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger that, glad you are enjoying the show,'' responded Robert
Curbeam, the shuttle crew's liaison in mission control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, enjoying the show is right. This is beautiful,'' said
Glenn, now a millionaire businessman turned U.S. senator.
</P>
<P>
   When informed that many of his friends and family wondered how
the world's oldest space traveler was faring, Glenn offered a
spirited assessment:
</P>
<P>
   ``The first report is great. I don't know what happens down the
line, but today is beautiful and great.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let the record show that John has a smile on his face and it
goes from one ear to the other, and we haven't been able to remove
it yet,'' Discovery commander Curt Brown told mission control.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery thundered from NASA's Kennedy Space Center at 2:19
p.m.,EST, thrilling a large crowd of on-lookers that included
President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, dozens of Glenn's
legislative colleagues and thousands of tourists who flocked to
Florida's Atlantic Coast to witness the event.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle climbed steeply into a clear blue sky on an easterly
course, trailing a dagger of fiery exhaust. The spacecraft settled
into a 345-mile high orbit, one of the loftiest for a shuttle
mission and nearly three times the altitude Glenn achieved on his
solo Mercury mission in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   The liftoff was delayed by 19 minutes so the Air Force could
chase off the pilots of five private planes that strayed into a
34-mile by 10-mile restricted air space corridor surrounding the
launch complex.
</P>
<P>
   It also provided the mission's first hint of drama.
</P>
<P>
   Five seconds before Discovery lifted off, what appeared to be
the aluminum cover panel for the shuttle's tail-mounted drag chute
popped free, striking the center rocket engine exhaust cone before
falling away.
</P>
<P>
   A team of Johnson Space Center engineers was formed immediately
to assess potential safety threats to Discovery's protective outer
insulation as well as to the exposed Kevlar and nylon parachute.
</P>
<P>
   The thermal protection system shields the shuttle from the 3,000
degree temperatures at re-entry. The 40-foot parachute has been
deployed routinely at landing since 1992, using a mortar charge to
push it out of the tail as the shuttle touches down. The chute
supplements the shuttle's wheel brakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of engineering homework that needs to go on,''
said Don McMonagle, who chairs the NASA mission management team.
``We need time to analyze that. At this point, we know of no impact
to the mission.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident, however, was reminiscent of the heat shield
problem that Glenn experienced during his Mercury flight.
Throughout that near five-hour flight in 1962, ground controllers
debated whether to inform the astronaut of their concerns that his
tiny capsule's heat shield was loose and whether they should
curtail his three-orbit flight.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, NASA's Susan Still, an astronaut stationed in
mission control, radioed an account of the damage to the shuttle
crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a hazardous condition,'' Still informed Brown.
``We expect the mission to proceed as scheduled.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We copy all of that,'' Brown responded. ``Thank you very
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's flight won praise for NASA from Clinton, who watched the
final hours of the countdown from the launch control center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that all Americans share the exuberance that I feel
today,'' said Clinton, who became only the second president to
witness a launch in person. ``We had confidence in you, and a
conviction that our space program is good for the United States and
good for the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Discovery carries 83 widely varied science experiments. Glenn
has trained himself since February as a participant in 10 medical
experiments intended to provide researchers with an example of how
an elderly man responds to the rigors of weightlessness.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn is by far the oldest person to tackle a spaceflight,
grabbing the distinction from Story Musgrave, who flew for the last
time at 61 after three decades in NASA's astronaut corps.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his hero status, Glenn was denied a second chance to
fly during America's Cold War-era moon race with the former Soviet
Union. But he reclaimed the opportunity in the 1990s by convincing
the space agency he would be a useful subject in experiments
seeking a link between the natural aging process and the stresses
of space flight.
</P>
<P>
   NASA is about to begin the lengthy and difficult assembly in
space of the international space station, where similar biological
research will take place.
</P>
<P>
   The two most prominent experiments involving Glenn on the flight
will evaluate how his muscles wither in weightlessness and how his
sleep is affected by the ship's rapid passages through sunlight and
darkness.
</P>
<P>
   Others will assess the responses of his skeletal system, blood
pressure, balance and immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   Like the elderly, healthy young astronauts experience physical
degradations in each of those areas, changes they recover upon
their return to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers wonder whether the changes that have already
occurred in Glenn's body will be aggravated by spaceflight or
whether he may be immune to them.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, they hope that analysis of blood and urine
specimens from Glenn and pulse, respiration and temperature
readings will help uncover countermeasures to ailments such as
dizziness shared by astronauts and the aged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gained in the U.S. alone over 28 years of life
expectancy in less than a century, and 20 percent of that has been
from the base age of 65,'' said Dr. Robert Butler, gerontologist,
president of the International Longevity Center and among experts
who believe Glenn's flight may contribute to new advances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We no longer have the equation of old equals sick,'' Butler
said. ``We see more and more vigorous, robust persons with dramatic
reductions in disability rates and increasing health. It's almost
like we have a new stage of life itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Discovery's major activities will be the deployment
Saturday of a retrievable satellite called Spartan. Equipped with a
pair of telescopes, the satellite observatory has been programmed
to study the sun's corona and solar wind during a two-day free
flight.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery's high altitude also will permit ground controlled
assessments of a new computer and cooling system for the Hubble
Space Telescope, which shares the same orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn is among a crew of seven, headed by Brown, that includes
the first Spaniard in space, Pedro Duque, Japanese astronaut Chiaki
Mukai, pilot Steve Lindsey, flight engineer Scott Parazynski and
payload commander Steve Robinson. &QL;

 By JOHN P. LOPEZ 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
With the sharp click of a judge's gavel, she became an adult. Just
like that.
</P>
<P>
   It was a mandated progression of life, not a discovered one. It
was a draining moment that will test Dominique Moceanu's emotions
and resolve for years.
</P>
<P>
   Her legal victory was bittersweet because it came over the
people who were supposed to care the most. It came over the ones
who nurtured and provided, the ones who introduced her to the sport
with which she fell in love, but somewhere along the way became
glassy-eyed, obsessed and irrational.
</P>
<P>
   Few people ever have had to endure such a thing as Moceanu vs.
Moceanu. But few have had to endure what Dominique Moceanu did from
her parents, Dumitru and Camelia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two years were the worst,'' Moceanu said. ``I was
never really a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   She had to make a break. And when she finally did, the words
Dominique spoke were riveting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think, `Can't we go out for ice cream?''' she said.
```Can't you be my mom and dad instead of me being your
business?'''
</P>
<P>
   Taking away her childhood was one thing. Dominique wanted
adulthood to be hers.
</P>
<P>
   Why couldn't Dumitru and Camelia understand? Why couldn't they
grow up themselves?
</P>
<P>
   Two images vividly jumped into mind when Moceanu made a stand
last week, shedding the overbearing burden and overbearing father.
</P>
<P>
   One image was of a 12-year-old Moceanu signing autographs at
Bela Karolyi's gym in 1994. There was Moceanu, hardly big enough to
go on the rides at Astroworld yet brimming with such talent and
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Above many of the autographs, Moceanu wrote, ``'96 gold, for
sure.'' She underlined ``for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   It was clear she loved what she did. It was clear she had a
special knack that special athletes always seem to possess _ to be
supremely confident and bold.
</P>
<P>
   The other image came two years later, at the secluded house in
Atlanta where the 1996 ``Magnificent Seven'' stayed during their
golden Games.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after Moceanu helped fulfill the prediction she made as
a 12-year-old, she was sitting alone in a front room of the house,
her feet dangling off the edge of a couch, her confidence and
boldness breaking.
</P>
<P>
   A telephone sat to her right. Her gold medal was nearby. She was
fighting back tears.
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu had just spoken by phone with her father, who apparently
was not satisfied with Moceanu's gold-medal performance. A teammate
said she heard Dumitru screaming at Dominique for falling on a
vault attempt only moments before Kerri Strug clinched the team
gold with a vault on an injured angle.
</P>
<P>
   Dumitru apparently told Dominique that it should have been her
getting the attention instead of Strug. He said she failed. One day
later, Moceanu slipped on the balance beam during individual
all-arounds and did not make it to the medal podium. There were
more screams from Dumitru.
</P>
<P>
   Still later during apparatus finals, Moceanu could not complete
a back handspring combination on the beam and slammed her head
squarely into the thick piece of wood. She bravely got up and
finished the routine, but still there were more screams from Dad.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere along the way, Dumitru and Camelia became glassy-eyed,
obsessed and irrational. Dominique decided to become an adult no
matter the emotional pain.
</P>
<P>
   And her decision was not a hasty one.
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu said she thought about leaving home often since Atlanta
and even went to former Olympian Kurt Thomas' gym in Plano a few
months ago in search of advice and shelter. Dumitru Moceanu drove
to Plano when he heard of Dominique's plans and brought her back
home.
</P>
<P>
   Last week when Dominique left again, she met friends at a secret
meeting place she often used because she said her father screened
telephone calls and limited social activities. Her friends at first
tried to talk Dominique out of the decision.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Dominique had only a few dollars in her purse and was
upset because Dumitru had fired her coach, Luminita Miscenco. Her
friends wanted to make sure this wasn't a case of a teen-ager
rebelling, throwing a tantrum because she didn't get her way or had
to be home by a certain hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something I have to do,'' Dominique told her friends,
that special determined look in her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a serious decision,'' one of her friends said. ``This
is going to split your life permanently. It's not a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dominique began explaining everything that had happened
since Dumitru and Camelia first put her in gymnastics programs at
age 3. It was not a joke, either.
</P>
<P>
   The screaming. How she felt imprisoned. How she had every moment
of every day dictated to her. How there was no control.
</P>
<P>
   How it wasn't as much fun anymore. How she had no idea how much
money she had, or didn't have.
</P>
<P>
   How once someone called to wish Dominique a happy birthday and
Dumitru refused to give her the phone because he did not trust the
person. How she rarely went to friends' houses, she rarely could
discover things that kids like to discover _ gossiping on the
phone, talking about boys, hanging out. How it was all gym, gym,
gym.
</P>
<P>
   And how she wanted to become an adult.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Dominique asked her father why he paid cash for his
new car but she had to make payments on hers. She said Dumitru told
her, ``Because if you ever get money, you'll leave us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He had to control everything,'' Dominique said.
</P>
<P>
   On New Year's Eve last year, Dominique was allowed to stay up
and pop fireworks with friends. It was the first time she had been
to such a party and the first time she ever lit a firecracker. She
was 16.
</P>
<P>
   Guests at the party were amazed by how Dominique's face lit up
like a young child seeing Santa Claus. She laughed a genuine laugh,
not the one she often had to affect for the cameras. She giggled.
She kept asking if she could light more fireworks, and friends kept
running to a nearby stand to buy more.
</P>
<P>
   Then last summer, Dominique got to go water-skiing and
jet-skiing with friends and never wanted to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was peaceful,'' she said. ``It was different.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Dominique wanting to grow up and take on the world on her
own.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Moceanu awoke Thursday to the knowledge that suddenly she
was an adult and on her own. She was alone in her apartment. She
was alone in her thoughts and plans. And she liked it.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique spent the day attending to financial matters and
speaking with lawyers and accountants about her future. She tried
to find a gym at which she could resume her training. Because
Dumitru still runs Moceanu Gymnastics, the gym built with
Dominique's money, Dominique feels she cannot train there. She
wants to sever the gymnastics tie with her father.
</P>
<P>
   She also worried about Miscenco, the coach and friend, with whom
Dominique is sharing the apartment. Since Dumitru fired Miscenco, a
new sponsor must be found for the coach or Miscenco could be
deported. Dominique worried about her 9-year-old sister, who also
is involved in gymnastics and is at home with Dumitru and Camelia.
She went out to dinner and ordered what she wanted and went home
when she felt like it.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother and father never called.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's their move,'' Dominique said.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, she was tired and drained. But she was
happy to be on her own. Happy to be in control. She was happy to be
an adult.
</P>
<P>
   Dumitru and Camelia should try it.

 &HT;    Sales increase prediction lower than last year's
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Retailers will have another lackluster holiday season,
according to Jeff Humphreys (cq), the University of Georgia's
director of economic forecasting.
</P>
<P>
   He predicts holiday sales will increase 3.5 percent over 1997,
slightly lower than the sales increase last year. In 1997, holiday
sales totaled nearly $474 billion. The stock market's volatility
and high levels of personal debt will put the main crimps on
spending this year, said Humphreys. The report did not make a
prediction for metro Atlanta retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Humphreys is more pessimistic than Donald Ratajczak(cq),
director of the Economic Forecasting Center of Georgia State
University. Ratajczak predicts that Christmas retail sales will
increase 4 percent to 4.5 percent over last year, with Southeastern
retailers outpacing the national increase by a half percent.

MCDOUGAL SAYS EMPLOYERS KNEW OF PURCHASES  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA MONICA, Calif. _ Defending herself against charges of
stealing more than $150,000 from the conductor Zubin Mehta, Susan
McDougal testified Thursday that she had made credit card purchases
and cashed checks with the knowledge of Mehta and his wife, Nancy.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony that began on Wednesday, Mrs. McDougal has
described the Mehtas as living extravagant lives that included
excursions to department stores that ended with bags of new clothes
being handed to a household worker for pressing, and food, flowers
and potted plants being continually bought to spruce up houses that
Mrs. Mehta owned and rented out. Mrs. McDougal testified that at
Mrs. Mehta's urging, she made personal purchases during those
shopping trips and that it was not always easy to keep receipts.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us were great about it because we were shopping every
day, and going through stores like tornadoes,'' Mrs. McDougal
testified.
</P>
<P>
   State prosecutors say Mrs. McDougal, while working for the
Mehtas as a personal assistant and later a bookkeeper from 1989 to
1992, claimed about $65,000 in false expenses, forged Mrs. Mehta's
name on a credit card application and fraudulently charged more
than $90,000 in purchases, including airline tickets, hotel rooms
and expensive clothes.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony that began on Sept. 9, prosecutors presented 20
witnesses, including Mrs. Mehta, who testified that she had never
authorized Mrs. McDougal to apply for the credit card in her name
or to make most of the purchases.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. McDougal has maintained that Mrs. Mehta, whom she
portrayed as a constant and at times overbearing companion,
authorized her to order and make personal use of the credit card,
and said that many purchases, including $192 for panty hose at Saks
Fifth Avenue and $106 for bedding at Bullock's were made for Mrs.
Mehta at her request.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDougal, who acknowledged that she could not get a credit
card of her own when she move here from Arkansas because her credit
had been ``ruined,'' said Mrs. Mehta gave her many of her credit
cards to make purchases on her behalf, sometimes to pay for
purchases while Mrs. Mehta moved on to another department in the
store.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Mrs. McDougal's relatives and supporters have attended
the trial. Some of them approach reporters and lawyers during
breaks and, when asked, say the trial is an effort by the
independent counsel Kenneth Starr to punish Mrs. McDougal because
she refused to testify in his inquiry into the Whitewater land
deal, in which she and her husband were partners with Bill Clinton
and Hillary Rodham Clinton when he was governor of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDougal was held in jail for 18 months on a contempt
citation for refusing to testify about Clinton's financial dealings
before the Whitewater grand jury. That came before she was to start
serving a sentence for her conviction in 1996, in a case brought by
Starr on charges of taking part in a fraudulent scheme to obtain a
$300,000 small business loan for her company, Master Marketing, but
using the money to pay off debts of the Whitewater Development Co.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDougal's lawyer, Mark Geragos, has tried to link the
Mehta case to Whitewater, but Judge Leslie Light has barred Geragos
from making that argument in court. So Whitewater has not been
mentioned by name, though it has popped up, as when Mrs. McDougal's
fiance, Pat Harris, made a remark later stricken from the record
that he was ``extremely proud of her for refusing to lie,'' without
saying what Mrs. McDougal refused to lie about.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDougal's lengthy exchanges with Geragos have at times led
to complaints from prosecutors and rebukes from Judge Light, who
has repeatedly admonished Mrs. McDougal to restrict her answers to
the question before her, at one point telling her to ``let the
attorney argue this case, please.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge's displeasure has extended to Mrs. McDougal's sister,
Paula Cochrane, whom he chastised this morning for giving Mrs.
McDougal a thumbs-up sign at the end of Mrs. McDougal's testimony
on Wednesday while the jury was still in the room, and earlier in
the trial when Ms. Cochrane stormed out of the courtroom and
slammed the door earlier in the trial.

 By MICHELLE KREBS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ At the Boston auto show on Friday, the Saturn Corp.
pulled the wraps off a new model. And while such an introduction is
routine for most auto manufacturers, it is a rare occurrence for
Saturn.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years after General Motors Corp. established Saturn as
a grand $5 billion experiment, and eight years after customers
began to take delivery of the small cars built in Spring Hill,
Tenn., Saturn has been a success in several ways.
</P>
<P>
   It consistently ranks near the top in customer satisfaction and
buyer loyalty surveys. It has successfully established itself as a
youthful, customer-oriented brand capable of taking on the imports,
and it has brought in the kind of buyers _ including relatively
young, well-educated women _ that other GM divisions have had
trouble seducing.
</P>
<P>
   And some of Saturn's experimental processes have worked so well
they have spread to other parts of GM _ one of the original reasons
the subsidiary was set up.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while Saturn has plenty of fans, it doesn't have a lot of
new products. Aside from the EV1 electric car that is leased (in
very low volume) through Saturn dealers in California and Arizona,
the three-door coupe unveiled in Boston is Saturn's first real
change in its model lineup since its cars went on sale in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, Saturn's cars were almost a sideshow to the rest of
the experiment. The basic lineup _ compact coupes, sedans and
station wagons built on one platform _ was developed in the
mid-1980s, and the cars were by no means on the cutting edge when
they finally reached the market.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the styling and interior designs have been freshened
since then, but the mechanical systems have been tweaked only
slightly. Meanwhile, primary competitors like the Honda Civic and
Toyota Corolla have gone through two thorough redesigns that have
made them feel far more up to date.
</P>
<P>
   Saturn's dated cars are also competing in the coldest part of
the market. Small-car sales have plunged 20 percent in the last two
years as customers have shifted to midsize sedans and sport utility
vehicles. Saturn sales fell 10 percent in 1997 and are expected to
be off another 8 percent this year. Sales of the Civic have risen.
</P>
<P>
   With industry-wide sales incentives at their highest level in
several years, Saturn is saddled with an official no-haggling
policy, presenting prospective customers with a take-it-or-leave-it
price. And while competitors offer cash rebates and cut-rate
leases, Saturn does not. Rather than permit dealers to discount,
Saturn has reduced prices on some models or added equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Already growing old, the compact Saturns are not scheduled for a
major redesign until the 2003 model year, by which time they will
reach the geriatric age of 12. At that time, the small car line
shifts to a platform derived from the Opel Astra that will be
shared with other GM cars.
</P>
<P>
   A small Saturn sport utility is to arrive as a 2002 model, more
than a decade after the boom in sport utilities began. By then,
Toyota and Honda will be offering second generations of their RAV4
and CR-V, and other new entries will crowd the market.
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, Saturn's hope is a midsize car due next spring
as a 2000 model. The LS _ for ``large Saturn'' _ uses a platform
derived from that of the Opel Vectra, a German-built car that was
introduced in 1996. Modifications include replacing steel body
panels with plastic. (Current owners say plastic panels are part of
what makes a Saturn a Saturn.)
</P>
<P>
   The LS sedan and station wagon will be powered by a new
four-cylinder engine exclusive to Saturn and, for the first time in
the division's history, a V6, which is a variant of the Opel engine
used in the Cadillac Catera and the Saab 9-5.
</P>
<P>
   While a midsize car will be a welcome addition to the Saturn
line, its success is not assured. The LS will enter one of the most
competitive parts of the market, taking on a group of very
competent cars including America's best-sellers, the Toyota Camry,
Honda Accord and Ford Taurus. There is also the question of whether
consumers will view the LS as a true Saturn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The LS absolutely is a Saturn,'' Joe Kennedy, Saturn vice
president of sales, service and marketing, said in a recent
interview. Kennedy contends that consumers will recognize the LS as
quintessentially Saturn, due to its styling, interior ambiance and
attributes like the plastic body panels.
</P>
<P>
   The Saturn LS will be built at a GM plant in Wilmington, Del.,
that had been slated to close, using workers covered by the UAW's
national labor agreement. In contrast, Saturns are now built at a
Tennessee plant designed specifically to produce them.
</P>
<P>
   The workers were selected from GM employees nationwide and are
covered by a special contract that rewards them for meeting
quality, sales and profit objectives.
</P>
<P>
   What makes a Saturn a Saturn includes the way it is built and
developed, insisted Mike Bennett, manufacturing adviser and
chairman of the bargaining committee for UAW Local 1853, which
represents Saturn workers in Tennessee. He said that on the new LS,
it was Opel _ not Saturn or the workers _ that determined the
design and specified the parts.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, the union senses that the independence and
distinctiveness of Saturn are eroding as it has been folded into
GM's small car group and has undergone a series of management
changes. There has been no cheerleader for Saturn at the top of the
company, as there was with Roger B. Smith, the GM chairman when
Saturn was born.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Saturn remains optimistic about the LS. While executives
won't confirm sales projections, dealers are being told to plan for
sales practically to double; the plant can turn out 200,000 cars a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The 390 current dealerships are being encouraged to expand,
remodel showrooms and add outlets. Last week, Saturn said it would
encourage dealers to invest $100,000 each to install fireplaces,
aquariums, cappuccino machines and libraries in their showrooms, to
give them a homey feel.
</P>
<P>
   Some dealers, however, are reluctant to pump more investment
into dealerships that cost them, on average, $5 million to build
and, due to slumping sales, aren't nearly as profitable as they
once were.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts, likewise, are skeptical about Saturn's plan to double
sales. They think the midsize LS is likely to cannibalize sales of
the compact line. ``One plus one doesn't equal two in this case,
but maybe one and a half,'' said Maryann Keller, the auto-industry
analyst for ING Baring in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Saturn is counting on midsize car buyers yearning for the
Saturn's pleasing sales and ownership experience. ``There are a lot
of midsize buyers who would love the shopping, buying, owning
experience that is the cornerstone of Saturn and that has not been
available to them,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   The long delay in offering new products has some analysts
wondering whether the effort will be too little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``One would have thought that G.M. management would have figured
out long ago that no car company can stay afloat on one product
without substantial change,'' said Ms. Keller, who is pessimistic
about Saturn's long-term well-being. ``Saturn's product disaster _
and it is a disaster _ lays absolutely at the feet of GM
management.''
</P>
<P>
   John Casesa, an analyst for Schroder &AMP; Co., said Saturn was now
in the unenviable position of playing defense rather than offense.
``Saturn has to try to regain its momentum because GM waited a long
time to give it another product,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, the Saturn executive, defends GM's stewardship, noting
that decisions on future Saturn products would have had to be made
in the early 1990s when the parent company was in a deep financial
crisis, its board had ousted its top managers and Saturn had not
yet proved itself.
</P>
<P>
   Saturn faces other, formidable challenges beyond its shortage of
new products.
</P>
<P>
   Its pampering of customers is being copied by competitors who
can offer a broader range of cars and trunks.
</P>
<P>
   Its original goals included a mandate to beat the Japanese at
their own game on their home turf. Saturn established its Japanese
beachhead in April 1997, just before a deep recession. Import sales
are off sharply in Japan, and Saturn has had to scale back its
ambitious plans there.
</P>
<P>
   And labor relations in Spring Hill, once held up as a model for
the industry, have grown strained. Local 1853 voted last summer to
authorize its leaders to call a strike, partly because members said
that the unusual Saturn-UAW partnership was being undercut by GM's
moves toward common platforms and parts. Since then, the union
local has received assurances that the Saturn partnership will be
continued.
</P>
<P>
   And so in many ways the broader question raised by the Saturn
experiment falls to GM management: Will Saturn remain a different
kind of car company, as it advertises, or will it be just another
GM division? &QL;

IN INDIANA, A DISTRICT THAT MAY BE A BAROMETER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JEFFERSONVILLE, Ind. _ One of the first clues next Tuesday night
about the trend in this year's elections will be the early returns
from the congressional race here in southeastern Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, a Democrat, is retiring after 34 years in
Congress. The race to succeed him, which by all accounts is
extremely close, matches two aggressive, well-financed candidates
who take positions that vary not a whit from the dogma of their
respective national parties.
</P>
<P>
   The polls in Indiana close by 7 p.m., and the results are
usually among the first to be announced. The outcome of the
contest, in the Ninth District, may be a harbinger for results in
swing seats everywhere, especially in the 32 other districts where
incumbents are not seeking re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be a barometer for the country,'' said Amy Walter,
who tracks House races for the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan
newsletter in Washington. ``It may say something about turnout and
about what's happening in other places where good democratic
candidates are running in rural, conservative-leaning districts.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the third time the Republican, Jean Leising, a former
state senator, has run for the seat. She lost a close race to
Hamilton in 1994, the year of the Republican sweep nationally, and
was badly beaten in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Because of these two races, Ms. Leising, 49, began this campaign
well known throughout the sprawling district, which has 21 counties
and no town large enough to support its own television station.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Washington see the race as a prime opportunity to
pick up a seat that has been democratic for a generation. Speaker
Newt Gingrich and the 1996 presidential and vice presidential
nominees, Bob Dole and Jack Kemp, have been here to campaign for
Ms. Leising (pronounced LYE-sing).
</P>
<P>
   Her democratic opponent, Baron Hill, 45, started out without the
same degree of name recognition. Hill served in the state
legislature in the 1980s and ran unsuccessfully in 1990 against
Sen. Daniel Coats.
</P>
<P>
   But Hill, a retirement planner at Merrill Lynch, has been out of
the public eye for most of this decade. He tried to overcome this
by raising more than $800,000 and beginning television
advertisements much sooner than his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   But it is extraordinarily expensive to reach all the voters with
television advertisements. People in the district get their
television from five cities: Indianapolis; Louisville, Ky.;
Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio, and Evansville, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, both candidates spend their days crisscrossing the
district from one town to another, giving their standard speeches
and then hopping back into their cars to rush to the next rally.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Hill, accompanied in a van by Hamilton and Gov.
Frank L. O'Bannon, hit seven towns. Ms. Leising wound up her day
after 9 p.m. at a Farm Bureau meeting in Madison, on the Ohio River
about half-way between Louisville and Cincinnati. She was an hour
late, and the meeting was over by the time she arrived. But she
gathered the 20 stragglers who were downing the last of the cookies
and cider and gave her speech anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The issues that divide Ms. Leising and Hill are the ones that
separate Republicans from Democrats from coast to coast. Ms.
Leising emphasizes lower taxes and smaller government. Hill
stresses the importance of government programs like Social
Security, Medicare and aid to education.
</P>
<P>
   Hill favors gun control; Ms. Leising opposes it. He supports
abortion rights; she would outlaw abortion in almost all cases.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Leising would allow Social Security money to be invested in
the stock market; Hill would not. She wants to give parents
vouchers to pay for tuition at private schools; he talks about
reducing class sizes in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal in Washington almost never comes up. Ms. Leising has
called for President Clinton's resignation, but she never raises
the issue. Hill says he will not make up his mind until the
impeachment investigation is concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Hill says he is following in the footsteps of Hamilton, a
studious, mild-mannered democratic stalwart who is popular at home
and who, when his party was in the majority, was chairman at
various times of the foreign affairs, intelligence and joint
economic committees, as well as the panel that investigated the
Iran-Contra matter.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on Hill's behalf at a rally in this suburb of
Louisville, Hamilton said: ``He's a centrist, a moderate, fiscally
conservative. He's a Hoosier to the core.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Leising takes issue with that. In an interview, she said of
Hill: ``He is much more liberal than this district. The people here
are fiscally and socially conservative, and they're pro-business.''
</P>
<P>
   She is right about the conservative nature of the district. The
people here have Southern accents and small-town views. The
population is less than 2 percent black.
</P>
<P>
   But President Clinton carried the district, by about 500 votes
in 1992 and about 1,500 in 1996. O'Bannon, whose hometown, Corydon,
is in the district, carried it handily in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Leising says she is confident she will win. Hill says the
race is a toss-up. O'Bannon said that Ms. Leising had probably been
ahead but that Hill had drawn even. The answer will come on Tuesday
night, well before most of the other close races in the country are
decided.

   WASHINGTON _ In its eighth day, the Microsoft antitrust trial
shifted into a slower gear as a senior executive of America Online
was led through a painstaking cross-examination in which he was
asked to define technical acronyms and parse the fine print of
contract terms.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, Microsoft Corp.'s defense team had made a
few points and scored one clear victory _ it had dragged the
cross-examination out so long that the government did not have time
to show videotaped testimony from the company's chairman, Bill
Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Though not scheduled to appear in person, Gates is the absent
star of the trial. In the opening session last week, the government
used a few minutes of the lengthy taped deposition, showing an
apparently uncomfortable Gates saying he was not involved in
planning moves that Microsoft made in the Internet software market
which the Justice Department asserts were illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department contends that when set alongside
contradictory internal e-mail that Gates himself wrote about those
moves, the taped deposition is incriminating.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the videotape offers a pretty fair opportunity to
judge Gates' credibility,'' said David Boies, the Justice
Department's trial lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft replies that the videotaped deposition shows that
Gates is telling the truth, but is understandably not being too
cooperative as the target of a government prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you will see is a witness that doesn't let the government
put words in his mouth, and a witness who repeatedly defends
Microsoft's right to innovate,'' said Mark Murray, a company
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But the taped testimony will not be seen until sometime next
week, at the earliest, thanks to the methodical questioning style
of Microsoft's lead lawyer, John Warden.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and 20 states suing Microsoft have vowed
to show five or six hours of the 20 hours of the pretrial
deposition of Gates, taken in August. Yet they want to do it
between the scheduled appearances of witnesses at the trial. Court
sessions are not held on Friday, and the next government witness,
Avadis Tevanian, a senior vice president of Apple Computer is
scheduled to take the stand on Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   In court on Thursday, Warden used his second day of
cross-examining David Colburn, a senior vice president of America
Online, to try to portray Microsoft's dealings with its business
partners and competitors as standard practice in the computer
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The government says that Microsoft used its monopoly power in
personal-computer operating systems to persuade America Online, the
United States' largest online service, to agree to an exclusionary
deal that stifled competition in the market for software used to
browse the World Wide Web. Microsoft's main rival in the browser
market is Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1996, America Online says it agreed to make Microsoft's
Internet Explorer its main browser in exchange for a choice spot on
the Windows desktop _ the prime real estate in computing, since 90
percent of new personal computers are shipped with Microsoft's
Windows operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft replies that there is nothing exclusionary or illegal
about its contract with America Online. To further his ``everybody
does it'' defense, Warden focused on America Online's contract with
Netscape for a so-called instant messaging feature within its
online service. Instant messaging allows two computer users who are
online at the same time to exchange typed messages with each other
immediately _ the equivalent of a typed version of a telephone
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   The language of the September 1997 contract between Netscape and
America Online does prohibit America Online from promoting software
from Netscape's major rivals on its instant-messaging screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why,'' Warden asked, ``are these prohibitive provisions in the
agreement?''
</P>
<P>
   Colburn replied that as part of the deal, Netscape wanted to
make sure competitors' products were not promoted _ precisely the
kind of conduct Microsoft is accused of doing illegally.
</P>
<P>
   When he got his turn with the witness, Boies sought to point out
that things that are legal for most companies often are not legal
for a company with monopoly power, which the government alleges
Microsoft possesses.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Boies asked Colburn whether its instant messaging
feature was a method for distributing browser software.
</P>
<P>
   Not ordinarily, Colburn replied. Typically, he said, ``a user
who comes to the instant messaging area already has a browser.''
</P>
<P>
   Warden finished by asking Colburn whether it was true that
although Microsoft's Internet Explorer is the default browser
shipped with the online service's software, ``America Online
subscribers have the free and unfettered opportunity to use
Netscape's browser if they so choose?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Colburn replied, ``if they can figure out how to get
it. It's not easy.''

SOUTHWEST AIR TO TRY ITS CONTINENTAL WINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Southwest Airlines, the granddaddy of no-frills, discount
carriers, has made its name flying short hops between secondary
airports. But on Thanksgiving Day, the airline plans to offer its
first nonstop, transcontinental service _ for $99 one way.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest is known for lowering fares where it flies, so its
potential entry into the lucrative transcontinental market will be
closely watched by the rest of the hypercompetitive airline
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps for that reason, the airline is playing down the
significance of the inaugural flight from Oakland to Baltimore and
back, calling it a one-time test.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an opportunity to generate some revenue on a relatively
slow travel day because it is a holiday,'' said Linda Rutherford, a
Southwest spokeswoman. ``It is using a plane that would otherwise
sit idle.''
</P>
<P>
   But few people who have watched Southwest grow from a Texas
commuter carrier in the 1970s into one of the nation's larger
airlines think that it is testing for nothing. ``This is the best
news for consumers in a long, long time,'' said Terry Trippler,
editor and publisher of the Airfare Report, an industry newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Other industry specialists say Southwest faces some serious
challenges if it tries to become a long-haul carrier. The airline's
success has been based on frequent daily flights between
destinations. By getting its flights in and out of airport gates in
20 minutes, it has been able to use its planes and staff more
productively than other carriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Southwest's cost advantage is most notable on short-haul
flights,'' said Brian D. Harris, an airline analyst with Salomon
Smith Barney. ``I don't think their margins will be as good and
their competitive advantage will be as good if they are flying
transcontinental.''
</P>
<P>
   Southwest is also known for bare-bones service. Its planes have
no first-class cabins and no assigned seating. On most flights, the
only food is peanuts, and the in-flight entertainment is supplied
by wisecracking flight attendants. Regular transcontinental
passengers are used to first-class upgrades and movies.
</P>
<P>
   But Southwest is wildly popular and has had success adding
longer routes. It now offers coast-to-coast service using a change
of planes in Nashville. It also has a direct flight from
Providence, R.I., to Los Angeles that stops in Kansas City, Mo.,
but passengers do not have to change planes.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest has a strong incentive to lengthen its flights because
of a new federal law that will eventually charge $3 a passenger
each time a plane takes off and lands. Airlines used to be charged
an excise tax on each ticket, but in a deliberate swipe at
Southwest and other low-fare competitors, the large carriers
pressed to have the tax reduced in exchange for takeoff and landing
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest faces other problems. After expanding from Texas into
California, Florida and more recently into the Northeast in
Baltimore, Providence and Manchester, N.H., it is facing stiffer
competition. ``Their growth markets are not as robust as they were
a few years ago,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that Southwest, which has grown faster and has been
more profitable than most larger competitors, is still a growth
airline. While concern about a weakening economy has other carriers
talking about scaling back plans to expand next year, Southwest
intends to grow by 13 percent and is hungry for more.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of this year, it expects to have taken delivery of 20
new Boeing 737 jets with 29 more arriving in 1999. These planes,
which fly farther and burn less fuel than previous models, also
allow Southwest more flexibility to fly coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   Transcontinental service is certainly where the money is. United
says the number of nonstop, coast-to-coast flights by all airlines
has doubled since 1990. United has increased its transcontinental
routes 12 percent this year compared with growth of 3 percent to 4
percent on its full network.
</P>
<P>
   And Southwest cheers consumers. The unrestricted, last-minute
transcontinental fares often paid by business travelers can rise
above $900 one way in cities where Southwest has no presence. But
from Providence to Los Angeles, United and others have matched
Southwest's one-way unrestricted fare of $302.

CHICAGO LOSING A BASTION OF DOUBLE-CHECKED FACTS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BARBOZA    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The City News Bureau, a fixture in American journalism
that trained Mike Royko, Kurt Vonnegut, Seymour Hersh and legions
of other gritty reporters here, will close after more than 100
years as Chicago's legendary news-gathering operation.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau, which is one of the nation's oldest continuously
running news services, is jointly owned by the city's two major
daily newspapers, The Chicago Tribune and The Chicago Sun-Times.
For the past few years the bureau had been losing money and
subscribers and Wednesday officials close to the papers said that
the hemorrhaging had finally become terminal.
</P>
<P>
   ``A decision has been reached to close the City News Bureau
sometime in the first quarter of next year,'' said Larry Green,
executive editor of The Chicago Sun-Times and a board member of the
City News Bureau. ``The two papers have been carrying the load. But
it's losing money. It lost about $1 million last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports of the bureau's demise became known Wednesday, Green
said, even though neither newspaper released a statement. But late
Wednesday night, reporters at the City News Bureau said they were
preparing their own story.
</P>
<P>
   The staff of about 29 reporters and 15 other employees was told
of the decision Thursday afternoon, they said, when the bureau's
general manager called a staff meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really didn't go into a staff meeting,'' said Kim
Kishbaugh, an assistant city editor who has worked at the bureau
for about 12 years. ``He just said: `City News is closing.'
Everybody's in shock.''
</P>
<P>
   For many here, the City News Bureau was an icon in a city known
for its tough exterior and its hard-nosed journalism. Founded in
1890, the agency later became the subject of the Broadway play,
``The Front Page,'' the quintessential saga of 1920s journalism in
Chicago. And Arnold Dornfeld, a legendary editor who reporters said
was as much a terror as a teacher, established the City News Bureau
standards: double check everything. ``If your mother says she loves
you,'' he liked to say, ``check it out.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the days before journalism schools popped up, the City
News Bureau funneled reporters into the city's major dailies,
functioning as a journalism bootcamp, many said. From its bustling
offices stories were sent through pneumatic tubes that circled
Chicago's underground to the many daily newspapers that subscribed
to the bureau's service.
</P>
<P>
   The alumni include Royko, Vonnegut and Hersh, all of whom later
earned Pulitzer Prizes, and Charles MacArthur, the playwright, as
well as scores if not hundreds of reporters at the newpapers and
others around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But as the number of newspapers in Chicago dwindled, the City
News Bureau, which offers no advertising and depends on fees from
newspapers that subscribe, had difficulty meeting its budget.
</P>
<P>
   Television and radio stations also subscribed to the wire
service, but last year many of the broadcast outlets rejected
higher fees, Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Green said that projections were that the operation would
continue to lose money for the next three or four years. ``A lot of
beloved institutions are not here anymore,'' he said. ``This town
once had many newspapers. It's down to two. A lot of those
newspapers weren't making money, so they went out of business. And
that's what happened to the City News Bureau. This isn't a
charitable institution.''

SINGH SHOOTS BLISTERING 63 IN ATLANTA  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This has been the best year of Vijay Singh's career,
and Thursday he played one of the best rounds of his life. Shooting
a brilliant seven-under-par 63 on a challenging East Lake Golf Club
course where only nine players broke par, Singh soared to a
three-stroke lead over Billy Mayfair after the first round of the
Tour Championship.
</P>
<P>
   It was a machine-like display of ball-striking by Singh, this
year's PGA Champion, who only missed one fairway and putted with
precision on lightning-fast greens that invited mistakes. Singh's
round was the best competitive round in East Lake's history, and it
also matched the lowest round in Tour Championship history, equaled
by Wayne Levi in 1989 and Jim Gallagher Jr. in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Barnes holds the course record (62) at East Lake, but the
legendary Bobby Jones, who learned to play golf at East Lake, never
shot better than a 63 on his home course.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what club Singh held in his hands Thursday, he
felt confident of hitting a good shot. Singh made it look easy. But
it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbelievable,'' said Singh, whose round included eight birdies
and one bogey as he avoided the treacherous Bermuda rough. ``I hit
the ball probably the best I did all year. I drove the ball really
long and straight. The longest iron I hit today was a 6-iron.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was an exceptional round for anybody to shoot 63 around
here. I think the longest putt I had was 18 feet. It's one of the
best rounds I've had ever from tee to green.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody could keep pace with Singh Thursday, but with three
rounds remaining on a course this difficult, most players in the
elite 30-man field remained within striking distance. Mayfair's 66
left him alone in second place, while Tom Lehman and Jim Furyk (67)
were tied for third place.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the competition for the money title and PGA Tour
Player of the Year honors could get interesting before the weekend
ends. David Duval can clinch the money title simply by finishing
alone in 24th place or better. But Duval struggled to a 75, leaving
him tied for 28th place with Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   If Duval finishes lower than 24th, and if Furyk wins the
tournament, Furyk can snatch the money title from Duval. And Duval
is battling Mark O'Meara for Player of the Year honors, but O'Meara
did not have a sparkling round either, shooting a one-over-par 71.
</P>
<P>
   The scores of Duval and Woods, neither of whom had a birdie,
showed how difficult East Lake is, but Singh was almost too good to
notice. He shot a five-under-par 30 on the front nine, using his
accuracy to set up makeable birdie putts. At No. 1, Singh hit a
9-iron approach shot to within six feet of the cup. At No. 3, he
hit a sand wedge to within a foot. At No. 5, he hit another 9-iron
to eight feet. At No. 8, he hit a pitching wedge to a foot. Singh
made all of those ensuing short putts for birdie, then at No. 9, he
made an 18-foot birdie putt, just in case anyone felt that he could
not make a long one.
</P>
<P>
   The only blemish on Singh's card came at the par 3, No. 18, when
he bogeyed by three-putting from 40 feet. But it did not spoil his
day, or his year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the talk about Duval and O'Meara, Singh is third on
the money list, and he has won two tournaments (PGA Championship
and Sprint International). If Singh were to take home the $720,000
first-place check, he would finish No. 2 on the money list, and he
would have more victories on tour this year than anyone except
Duval (four).
</P>
<P>
   Singh entered this week somewhat overshadowed, but he was not
after Thursday. Most of Singh's gallery came to see Woods, Singh's
playing partner. But while people may have arrived talking about
Woods, they left talking about Singh.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole game is getting better,'' said Singh, a 35-year-old
native of Fiji, who lives in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla. ``But I was
never expecting to shoot anything like that. I just said, `Make
sure you play solid, shoot a good number, don't shoot yourself
out.' It turned out really good for me.''

FOR GLENN WATCHERS, A FIERY LAUNCH AND THE BLINDING TRUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. _ A lifetime of watching rocket-ship
launchings through television's filter is poor preparation for the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is a fireball of liquid oxygen so bright the eye
flinches from habitual fear of the sun.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is acceleration so abrupt that the ship is halfway to
Bermuda before the sound of its explosive takeoff rumbles into a
spectator's ear five miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is the highest of technology is surrounded by some of
the lowest of life forms along the swampy Banana River, part of a
lush national wildlife refuge that incongruously hosts the planet's
busiest spaceport.
</P>
<P>
   And at 2:19 p.m. EST, the truth was that several thousand of us
dolphins, egrets, perch, mosquitoes and biped mammals raised a
flipper, foot, claw or fist as the light and the roar swept over
us.
</P>
<P>
   Some of us raised them in fear, and took to air or deep water.
Most of us beach-bound bipeds were so thrilled we made a little
water of our own. No, not that way _ we sent salty contributions to
this Atlantic Ocean estuary down our sunbaked cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's launch of the space shuttle Discovery, with its
precious cargo of America's space past that is attempting to
stimulate the world's space future, meant many things to many
people.
</P>
<P>
   For one couple, it meant an invitation. The strangest truth of
the day was that my wife and I know a guy strapped to that exotic
Roman candle.
</P>
<P>
   No, not John Glenn. Everybody sort of knows Glenn, especially
those of us who, as children, went into space vicariously with him
in his tiny, tinny black space capsule. We returned again as aging
baby boomers in his time machine.
</P>
<P>
   The guy known to Julia and me is Steve Robinson, one of the
astronauts doing the mission's heavy lifting. He isn't well-known
because he and his mission mates are lost below the Glenn hype that
feeds our national addiction to nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who turned 43 Monday, is a Sacramento native who has
master's and doctorate degrees from Stanford, directed research at
MIT in mechanical engineering, and worked at Ames Research Center
and NASA. His first shuttle mission was 15 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   He also received a degree (below zero) from the Seattle School
of Old Houses.
</P>
<P>
   Several years before he was named to the astronaut corps,
Robinson visited his sister, Lynn, who was renting a ground-floor
apartment in our old home in the Leschi neighborhood of Seattle.
Also visiting that night was a rare deep snow and freeze. Because
he inadvertently closed a door to a vent that heated another room
besides his, he awoke to a nearly frozen sister and completely
frozen water pipes.
</P>
<P>
   So we spent part of a languid day together, holding hair dryers
to exposed pipes and siblings. Although we hadn't seen each other
since Lynn's wedding a few years later, he apparently remembered
from our idle chats a pathetic sportswriter who probably could use
a trip to Florida as much as he could use pipe insulation.
</P>
<P>
   For our part, we know this Discovery mission is in good hands if
anybody were to forget to close the shuttle door. My man packs
enough heat to thaw even a frozen stare from Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson is the self-effacing sort who would never speak up
about the attention devoted to Glenn. But the scientist in him, and
the scientist among his crewmates and the thousands remaining on
Earth who prepare every shuttle mission, have to be a little
torqued at the attraction that brought an estimated one million
spectators and more than 3,800 journalists from around the world to
the Space Coast this week.
</P>
<P>
   As the last, best space cowboy, Glenn's hold on America is
permanent and unalterable. To duplicate, as a 77-year-old, his feat
of Earth orbit when he was a robust Marine test pilot is more than
the Right Stuff. It's the Perfect Stuff.
</P>
<P>
   But NASA skeptics and some scientists have howled since the plan
was announced. Glenn's inclusion, they said, was a publicity stunt
of minuscule technical value done for politics, while creating an
unjustifiable risk for an American icon too elderly to withstand
the ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   To which can Glenn can so far respond: Nee-ner, nee-ner,
nee-ner.
</P>
<P>
   Politics? Well, of course. NASA has always been about politics.
It was politics that created the space race between the Americans
and the Soviets and launched Glenn into orbit in 1962. It was
politics that prompted the Apollo-Soyuz docking in 1975 that helped
thaw Soviet-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is politics again. The next stage of exploration is the
international space station, a hugely expensive and controversial
orbiting platform that NASA insists is the gateway to the stars.
</P>
<P>
   NASA has partnered up with 10 nations to put the thing together,
and it has doled out some aspect of the station or shuttle program
to nearly every state.
</P>
<P>
   NASA is in search of massive public support because its most
high-profile and productive partner, Russia, is likely to bail out
of its station obligations. Guess who will be left holding the
cosmic bag?
</P>
<P>
   To overcome this imminent political debacle, NASA made a clever,
if obvious, choice: It hired an eminent politician. For all the
fame Glenn earned for a five-hour flight 36 years ago, his past 24
years have been in the U.S. Senate, where he became an adroit
practicioner in turning public emotion into national policy.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he's said his farewells to the Senate, Thursday
Glenn began perhaps his most extraordinary campaign yet _ renewing
America's commitment to space exploration without having either the
Russians or the moon as obvious targets.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the space center here can see the first piece of
station hardware, the Unity Node, being readied in a giant clean
room a few miles from Discovery's 39B launch pad. Next door at 39A,
and already loading up, is Discovery's sister craft, Endeavor,
which will put the part in orbit in December.
</P>
<P>
   The space station is happening, as Boeing well knows. And NASA
is going to have to foot an even bigger bill. The only way the
project can continue is with an increased commitment from the
American public.
</P>
<P>
   If an emotional temperature could have been taken on the
beaches, highways, parks and schoolgrounds of the Space Coast
yesterday, there would be no doubt about the fate of the space
station.
</P>
<P>
   After so many routinely successful shuttle missions, Glenn
yesterday reintroduced excitement, apprehension, dread and
inspiration _ the vital human mix of fuels that ignited Columbus,
Cook, Lewis and Clark, the Mercury program and all others who have
taken a step off the edge.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Thursday was more for psyche than science. Sure, it was
politics. It's always been politics. It's usually the only way
science gets done.
</P>
<P>
   The American soul has to burn hot before the launch pad reveals
the searing light.

   ATLANTA _ While television viewers in Atlanta were learning on
Wednesday afternoon that Michael Coles, the Democratic Senate
candidate in Georgia, ``doesn't deserve a single vote,'' those in
Los Angeles were told that Matt Fong, the Republican Senate
candidate in California, ``is wrong on the issues that matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Those watching in New York were informed that Rep. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y., is devoted to ``raising taxes to spend on his pet
programs,'' while Bostonians heard that Acting Gov. A. Paul
Cellucci, a Republican, ``went back on his word'' after promising
to hire new teachers. In Chicago, Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun, a
Democrat, was being criticized for ``six years of scandal and
controversy,'' while in Seattle, former Rep. Jay Inslee, a
Democrat, was chastised for missing ``more than 60 percent of his
committee meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   Those often hyperbolic messages, all of them broadcast from 5
p.m. to 6 p.m. ET, typify the Jerry Springer-style vitriol that
prevails in the final days of the 1998 campaign. The enduring
impression left by three hours of television viewing in six cities
on Wednesday was one of overarching negativism, even at a point
when campaigns typically abandon their attacks to finish with
upbeat images.
</P>
<P>
   The level of negativity in this year's campaign is nothing new,
according to media consultants and authorities on political
advertising. But its volume and intensity is nonetheless striking,
particularly in a week when Republicans opened a nationwide
television advertising blitz that uses President Clinton's sex
scandal as a theme.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a channel changer, it was possible in Atlanta on
Wednesday to skip from attack ad to attack ad while hardly ever
landing on actual programming, as if the commercials were stepping
stones in a stream. Of the 35 political advertisements viewed on
four channels from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m., only a third failed to
highlight an opponent's perceived shortcomings. During one
three-minute station break on WAGA-TV, Atlanta's Fox affiliate,
five different political ads aired back-to-back, with only one of
them positive.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the candidates seemed to be debating through their
advertisements. Immediately after an advertisement for Guy Millner,
Georgia's Republican candidate for governor, accused Roy Barnes,
the Democratic candidate, of supporting ``racial quotas and
preferences,'' a Barnes commercial rebutted it by accusing Millner
of being ``so desperate he's resorted to 1950s hate tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   In a study of more than 500 advertisements in 30 states,
Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School for
Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, found that
campaign advertising is being dominated by commercials that attack
opponents or contrast positions, and that the tone has become more
negative as Election Day nears.
</P>
<P>
   In the week ended last Thursday, Dr. Jamieson found that 33
percent of all ads attacked, compared to 23 percent in the previous
week; 38 percent of the ads contrasted positions, compared to 37
percent the previous week, and only 29 percent of the ads purely
advocated for their candidates, compared to about 40 percent a week
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Some media consultants said the cumulative impact of such
saturation negative advertising is an increasingly distrustful
public, which then forces candidates to find ever more compelling
ways to grab attention. This year's techniques have included the
growing use of humor in advertisements and a reliance on victims,
like those who have been denied coverage by health maintenance
organizations, to tug the voters' heartstrings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most notable thing to me is how difficult it is this year
to penetrate the public mind, how cynical they are and how they are
skeptical of anything anybody says,'' said Raymond Strother, a
Democratic consultant working for candidates for governor in
Georgia and New Mexico and for a Senate candidate in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Negative advertising still works, but it works less well than
it once did,'' Strother said. ``It's just the abundance of it.
People have built up an immunity or resistance to it.''
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean that Republican candidates are no longer
characterizing their Democratic opponents as liberal taxers and
spenders or that Democrats have stopped painting the Republicans as
threats to Social Security, the environment and public schools. But
it does mean that those core messages are often supplemented by
testimonials from citizens who turn personal tragedy into political
protest.
</P>
<P>
   In an advertisement in Georgia for Coles, who is challenging
Sen. Paul Coverdell, a somber Jodi Garrison says she lost a baby
during delivery after her HMO rejected her doctor's recommendation
that she have a Caesarean section. ``It was the worst day of my
life,'' she says. ``The only time my husband and I got to hold our
daughter was after she died.''
</P>
<P>
   The text in the commercial then says that ``Paul Coverdell voted
against the right to sue HMOs for these terrible tragedies.''
</P>
<P>
   While victims are being used to make attack ads vividly
personal, humor has been employed to soften the edges of a genre
better known for its use of sinister voices and grainy
black-and-white photographs.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, the Republican candidate for governor, Jeb Bush, has
scored with a series of advertisements that play off the nickname
of his Democratic opponent, Kenneth (Buddy) MacKay. After an
announcer declares that MacKay has supported a number of tax
increases, various characters retort: ``He's not my buddy.''
</P>
<P>
   And in South Carolina, a part-time actor, Kerry Maher, has
become something of a folk hero by appearing in Democratic Party
advertisements as ``Bubba,'' a store clerk from Georgia who sells
lottery tickets and appreciates Gov. David Beasley, a Republican,
for keeping a competing lottery out of neighboring South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The state Republican Party then created the anti-Bubba, a New
Jersey thug named Vinny who suggests, in heavy dialect, that the
lottery will lead to casino gambling. ``Everything we got here in
Atlantic City youse gonna get right dere in South Carolina,'' Vinny
says.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Here in Georgia, where increasing partisanship has been
accompanied by a corresponding rise in nastiness, television
viewers have found plenty of reason for cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   Millner, the Republican candidate for governor, recently put out
an advertisement that noted his promises to cut taxes and then said
that his opponent, Barnes, ``will increase property tax
exemptions.''
</P>
<P>
   That accusation could not be more true, but it seems to assume
that voters will not realize that increased property tax exemptions
_ as opposed to increased property taxes _ are desirable for
homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   That ad came on the heels of one by Mitch Skandalakis, the
Republican candidate for lieutenant governor, suggesting that his
opponent, Mark Taylor, has a cocaine habit that Taylor says ended
15 years ago. As the ad depicts a Taylor look-alike padding down
the hallway of a rehab clinic, a narrator says: ``Taylor, of
course, has admitted he had problems years ago. And we all wish
those problems had been cured.''
</P>
<P>
   Skandalakis has failed to produce any evidence supporting his
suggestion of continued drug use, and Taylor has sued him for
slander.
</P>
<P>
   In state after state, candidates are running negative ads
attacking their opponents for running negative ads, with many
featuring women as the scolds. In Colorado, for example, Diane
Greenlee, whose husband, Bob, is a Republican candidate for
Congress, says in a commercial that ``my deepest fear was that Mark
Udall would disregard the facts and just make up lies about Bob.''
</P>
<P>
   And from Georgia to Washington state, gray-haired women have
been employed by candidates to chastise their opponents for
distorting their records. ``Patty Murray is fibbing about Linda
Smith,'' says an elderly woman in an ad for Ms. Smith, the
Republican senatorial candidate in Washington. ``Shame on you,
Patty.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the National Republican Congressional Committee began
running advertisements this week that encourage voters not to
reward Clinton by sending Democrats to Washington, the White House
sex scandal had played a direct role in only a few commercials. But
a number of candidates have used their ads to play up issues like
character and trust, and some have broadcast endorsements intended
to emphasize their devotion to family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone has provided more courageous leadership
or worked harder to improve people's lives than Buddy MacKay,''
says an ad for the Florida Democrat. The speaker is Anne MacKay,
the candidate's wife of 39 years.

WOMAN SENTENCED TO 15 YEARS IN DEATH OF BABY AT PROM 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREEHOLD, N.J. _ With a stern declaration that the law must
protect all lives, a New Jersey judge Thursday imposed a 15-year
prison sentence on the young woman who had admitted killing her
newborn son at her senior prom in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, John A. Ricciardi, said that the woman, Melissa
Drexler, 20, would be eligible for parole after 2 years and 11
months. Nevertheless, her 15-year sentence is far harsher than the
30-month and 24-month sentences that Amy Grossberg and Brian
Peterson received, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-agers, both from Wycoff, admitted guilt in July in the
death of their newborn son at a motel in Newark, Del., in November
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Both cases of infanticide involving New Jersey teen-agers ended
with plea bargains. The sentencing disparities stem primarily from
differences in the charges each pleaded to.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Miss Drexler admitted having given birth to a live baby
in a bathroom stall at a catering hall in Aberdeen Township, 20
miles from her home in Forked River, and then taking the baby from
a toilet, wrapping him in plastic bags and placing him in a trash
container in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   She pleaded guilty to aggravated manslaughter, which is a more
serious charge than the manslaughter counts Miss Grossberg and
Peterson accepted. The basic element in both is the reckless
causing of death. But aggravated manslaughter also requires that
the defendant must have shown ``extreme indifference'' to human
life.
</P>
<P>
   Before she was sentenced Thursday, Ms. Drexler told the judge,
in a childlike, barely audible voice, that she was ``really, truly
sorry.'' Ricciardi then said she was not ``a monster _ someone to
be gawked at'' or ``vilified'' in the media or on talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's entitled to our understanding, to our compassion and,
indeed, our prayers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he went on, she had taken a ``precious, helpless life'' and
must now accept the consequences. He equated the killing to
murdering a president, a doctor, a mother or an older child.
</P>
<P>
   ``All such lives are equally worthy in a civilized society,''
Ricciardi said. ``The victim here has as much right to life as any
one of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, as her parents and friends wept in the
spectators' gallery, Ms. Drexler was led away in handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   She faced between 10 and 30 years Thursday. Ricciardi's choice
of 15 matched the recommendation that the Monmouth County
Prosecutor, John Kaye, made as part of the plea agreement with her
lawyer, Steven Secare.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Grossberg and Peterson each faced a maximum sentence of 10
years. But Delaware's sentencing guidelines give judges discretion
to impose up to 30 months on first-time offenders. Peterson
received six months less than Miss Grossberg because he cooperated
with the authorities and promised to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Both are likely to serve their full terms because Delaware does
not offer parole and provides only minimal time off for good
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Secare said after the sentencing that Miss Drexler hoped to be
released to a halfway house within two years.
</P>
<P>
   He also called for passage of a federal infanticide law that
would provide for probation for mothers with psychiatric
disabilities who kill their infants. Several countries in Europe do
not criminalize these cases, and American judges should have
options not to imprison these women, Secare said.
</P>
<P>
   In his sentencing remarks, Ricciardi said he would leave
discussion of a mother's motivation in infanticide to
psychiatrists, psychologists and social scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the law is concerned with is, a life has been taken,'' he
said. Moments later, the judge called the 15-year term fair and
just and ``a proper resolution of this very difficult matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the sentencing, Secare and an assistant prosecutor
offered different portraits of the defendant. Miss Drexler wept
quietly in a corner of the jury box while Secare told the judge she
was an immature, disoriented and frightened person who was in
denial throughout her pregnancy and during the trip to the prom.
Even though she had labor cramps before reaching the catering hall,
``there was no inevitability of birth'' on her mind when she
arrived, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Secare said his client had made a ``terrible, horrible, tragic
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She wants to tell her parents she's sorry, she wants to tell
this court she's sorry, she wants to tell the baby she'll never see
she's sorry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The assistant prosecutor, Elaine Leschot, rejected the defense
argument about denial and described Miss Drexler as a selfish
person who hid the pregnancy from her family and friends and
refused to take responsibility to deal with it because of concerns
that it would interfere with the fun of her senior year.
</P>
<P>
   After disposing of the baby, Ms. Leschot said, Ms. Drexler ``got
re-dressed, she fixed her hair, and she went out and ate a salad.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Leschot said that the judge had received many letters
supporting Ms. Drexler, but none on the baby's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``The friend of the baby in this courtroom is me,'' Ms. Leschot
said. ``Somebody has to say, `We will protect the helpless.' ''

NBC MAY FACE BOYCOTT BY PLAYERS AFTER LOCKOUT ENDS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a reporter from the NBC affiliate in Las Vegas asked Chuck
Person if he could have a few minutes last week, the San Antonio
Spurs guard shook his head and declined. Several other National
Basketball Association players soon followed his lead. Walking away
they muttered, ``We're not going to do NBC.''
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, saying no to one of the broadcast outlets that
has helped line the coffers of the NBA for the past decade _ a
network that has helped make the players incredibly famous and
wealthy _ did not seem like prudent business. But in what can be
construed as either sincere animosity or merely a labor bargaining
ploy, dozens of the league's players have said they are weighing
the possibility of a network boycott.
</P>
<P>
   Labeling NBC and the Turner Sports cable network as
``co-conspirators'' in the current lockout, the union equates the
approximately $475 million in guaranteed television rights fees
that will be paid to the NBA this season _ regardless of whether
games are played _ as giving the owners more clout in their
economic fight with the players. It has elicited talk from the
players of penalizing the two networks by not doing interviews both
during and after the current labor impasse.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing, the union president, said that the players, ``to
a man,'' were angry that NBC and Turner Sports ``have taken the
active role that they have in promoting this lockout.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When all is said and done,'' Ewing added, ``this lockout will
have cost the players a lot of money, and NBC's role will not be
forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Billy Hunter, the union executive director, ``We're not
going to do anything that would be negligent or detrimental to the
overall success of the league, but our players are not looking very
favorably'' on NBC and Turner Sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of players have actually stated that they're not going
to do interviews with either network,'' Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   The consequences for a network boycott could be costly,
resulting in huge fines for players who refused interviews. The
owners and union are still negotiating player-conduct issues, some
of which entail how much players should be docked for failing to
make themselves available for mandatory news media sessions.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, it is one thing for the league and players to brood
about lost games and lost paychecks in a lockout that has already
led to the cancellation of the first month of the regular season.
But that NBC and Turner Sports _ which shows games on TBS and TNT _
could emerge as the next casualties of the four-month-old stalemate
left NBA Commissioner David Stern befuddled.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are outlets that provide interviews, that provide studio
jobs for our players, that do additional shows and that provide new
careers for them,'' Stern said Thursday. ``If anything, they are
the most responsible for the growth of this sport and the success
of the sport and the salaries that our players earn.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I'm comfortable that when we make the deal, reality
will be reaffirmed.''
</P>
<P>
   The new four-year deal between the league, NBC and Turner Sports
was announced last fall, a total $2.6 billion package that was
awarded without competitive bidding. While the contract provided
for work-stoppage protection for the league, the networks did
include clauses to recoup the losses incurred in paying for games
that might not be played. In NBC's case, the compensation will be
either a rebate or reduced rights fees in the final three years of
the deal. Turner Sports will be given extra games to broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, league officials believe the players are trying to
pull the networks into the fray in order that NBC and Turner Sports
might exert pressure on the owners to cut a deal and get the season
started. During a news conference in Manhattan on Wednesday, Hunter
alluded to NBC's recent layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things you also have to look at is what's happening
with NBC,'' Hunter said. ``NBC is one of the networks that has
underwritten the latest TV deal, which in a way helps finance the
lockout. I read the papers every day, and I saw that NBC is
experiencing some rather significant problems themselves. I don't
think NBC and TNT will stand by and let there not be a season. I
don't think I can close my eyes to that.''
</P>
<P>
   The union believes that the approximately $16 million in
guaranteed revenue for each of the 29 teams this season has
essentially amounted to a savings account for owners. And Hunter
singled out the lack of competitive bidding on the contract,
saying: ``David's position has always been because NBC has been
with the NBA for so long, they've become like a family. They've
helped insure the success of the league. So he's inclined to enter
into some agreeable arrangement with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter continued: ``Had the TV contract not been structured the
way it is, it would have made it a lot more difficult for the NBA
to load up. If they're sure they're going to be paid, the economic
impact on the owners is not as severe.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC's first scheduled television date this season is a Christmas
Day game between the Knicks and the Chicago Bulls, part of an NBA
doubleheader. TNT and TBS televise on Tuesday, Wednesday and
Fridays of each week during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Ebersol, the president of NBC sports, declined comment on
the union's statements. Greg Hughes, the vice president of public
relations for Turner Sports, said the cable network was not taking
sides in the dispute, regardless of the way the deal was
structured.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been clauses for work stoppages in our deals with
the NBA for the past 15 years, so this one is no different,''
Hughes said. ``We're not taking sides throughout the whole process.
We have been partners with the league and with the players. We hope
the players wouldn't hold the contract against us.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If there is one runner whom others fear in the final
hills of Sunday's New York City Marathon, it is Abel Anton of
Spain. He runs more like the miler that he once was than the
marathoner that he is. He stalks patiently, sitting on an
opponent's shoulder, waiting to unleash his ferocious kick. And
then he goes with cold detachment. A man who once slaughtered pigs
for a living cannot afford to be sentimental about his work.
</P>
<P>
   He has entered five marathons and won four, including the 1997
world championship in Athens. He is a former European champion at
10,000 meters and a bronze medalist at 5,000 meters. Three times he
has competed on the track in the Olympics. Few, if any, can match
his finishing kick in the marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he infuriates his opponents because they do the work
and he leaves them behind once they are spent. But they also know
that they are in trouble if the race enters the final miles and he
is near the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I am with the other athletes in the final two kilometers,
it will be difficult for them to leave me,'' Anton, 36, said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   German Silva of Mexico has won twice in New York. He does not
want to run 26.2 miles to end up in a sprint with Anton. That is a
blueprint for defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he is with the group in the last miles, we will do
something to kill his kick,'' Silva said. ``We will not let him
start with that kick.''
</P>
<P>
   At the 1997 world championships in Athens, running the course of
the original Olympic marathon, Anton hung on the shoulder of his
countryman Martin Fiz as if attached by a magnet. It was almost a
mocking gesture. He knew Fiz did not have the same finishing gear.
So Fiz could only anticipate the inevitable, trapped in Anton's
web.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the race turned into the marble stadium used a
century earlier for the 1896 Summer Olympics, Anton jumped Fiz,
darting inexorably into the lead in the final 400 meters. A
Mercedes passing a Volkswagen. Fiz was incensed. He had done all
the work. Too bad, Anton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the world championship,'' he said. ``The most important
thing was to win.''
</P>
<P>
   But Anton bristles when someone suggests that he is not willing
to work at the front. He is just as prepared to be the piano
carrier as the piano player, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, at the London Marathon, he and Antonio Pinto of
Portugal worked to catch Abdelkhader El Mouaziz of Morocco, reeling
him in after the Moroccan broke away. Mouaziz held a 15-second lead
heading into the final mile, but Anton chased him down to win with
a personal best of 2 hours 7 minutes 57 seconds. He slowed to wave
to the crowd and missed the course record by two seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am always able to go and work at the front,'' Anton said.
</P>
<P>
   He has become a hero in his home town of Soria, Spain, 125 miles
north of Madrid. Fermin Cacho, the 1992 Olympic champion at 1,500
meters, is also from Soria. Both have streets named after them.
When Anton returned from Athens with the world marathon title, 200
people were waiting at his home to greet him, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He could only have imagined this moment, the son of a gardener
in a humble family of nine children, who began running at age 14 in
jeans and street shoes in a local park. Now he was a world
champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started with a lot of expectations to be the best,'' said
his longtime coach, Enrique Pascual.
</P>
<P>
   As a 14-year-old, he could hardly support himself as a runner,
so Anton worked in a slaughterhouse, where he stayed until he was
21 or 22. And while sausages may not be high on the menu of most
carbo-loading marathoners, Anton still eats them regularly,
although he said, ``They are a higher quality now than the place I
worked.''
</P>
<P>
   At 25, he qualified for the 5,000 meters at the 1988 Summer
Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. By 1994, Anton was the European
champion at 10,000 meters. But that event is dominated by African
runners such as Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia and Paul Tergat of
Kenya. So Anton switched to the marathon in 1996, winning the
Berlin Marathon in his first attempt at a race of 26.2 miles.
</P>
<P>
   His early, continued success brought controversy last year, when
another Spanish marathoner, Pablo Sierra, accused Anton and Fiz of
using the drug EPO, a synthetic hormone that increases
oxygen-carrying capacity. They denied it, and Sierra was suspended
for six months by the Spanish track and field federation for making
unsubstantiated accusations. Anton and Fiz have never failed a drug
test, although none exist to detect EPO in a urine sample.
</P>
<P>
   At the London Marathon this year, Pinto said he was suspicious
of Anton's training methods, which incensed Anton. Thursday he
attributed Spanish marathoning success to a strong cross-country
background and to training grants provided by the national track
federation. He has called for blood testing to replace urine
testing in the sport, as long as the tests are conducted uniformly
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am always available for drug testing,'' Anton said.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City Marathon course seems designed for a racer of
Anton's calm demeanor. He suggested that he would run a tactical
race, cautiously moving through the first 20 miles, keeping the
leaders in sight, waiting to hit the accelerator in the rolling
hills of Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am here to win the race,'' he said. &QL;

WOODS-VAMPIRE (Los Angeles) _ In ``John Carpenter's Vampires,''
James Woods and Daniel Baldwin head a team of Vatican-sanctioned
vampire hunters who tear up the New Mexico countryside in their
pursuit of the undead. It's a bloody, profane, self-joshing
horror/action/comedy from the man responsible for such genre
classics as the original ``Halloween,'' ``The Fog,'' ``Escape From
New York'' and ``Starman.'' Yet it's not the kind of project you
associate with either actor. By Bob Strauss.

ADVERTISING: AT TOYS `R' US, HOLIDAY RUSH IS CRUCIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Calif.)  (lb) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The advertising that promotes Toys ``R'' Us Inc. for the holiday
shopping season is always crucial for the company, the United
States' largest toy retailer, which rings up 50 percent of its
annual business in the weeks leading up to Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   This year, though, as Toys ``R'' Us battles a sales slump, the
stakes confronting the chain are as high as the orbit of John
Glenn, who is featured along with models of his Discovery and
Friendship 7 spacecraft in a new Action Pack set of Hot Wheels toys
from Mattel.
</P>
<P>
   As Toys ``R'' Us loses customers and market share, the company
is reorganizing, revamping and retrenching, closing stores, cutting
costs and paring inventory to better compete against discount
retailers like Wal-Mart Stores, Target and Sam's Warehouse Club, as
well as electronic retailers like Etoys (www.etoys.com), which is
mocking the travails of traipsing through toy stores this time of
year in a humorous campaign by Kalis &AMP; Savage in Pacific Palisades,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   So the ads being produced for Toys ``R'' Us by Kaplan Thaler
Group in New York _ whose principal, Linda Kaplan Thaler, has
created campaigns for the company for most of the last two decades
_ must work harder to gain the attention of shoppers. For 1998, the
preholiday campaign is infused with a wide variety of emotional and
rational appeals.
</P>
<P>
   There are schmaltz and salutes to saving money, camp and
celebrations of bargain-hunting, sly humor and bold cries of
``Games and giveaways!'' There is even a cameo appearance, in a
commercial that parodies TV quiz shows, by Herbert Stempel, a
central figure in the quiz-show scandals of the 1950s as recounted
in the film ``Quiz Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a challenging year,'' said Ernie Speranza, senior vice
president for marketing and advertising at Toys ``R'' Us in
Paramus, N.J. ``We're just going to have to be sharper and
smarter.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``whether we're having a good year, a mediocre year or a bad
year, the Christmas period has tremendous importance to us,'' he
added. ``We have to make sure we're on target with our
communications.''
</P>
<P>
   Customers ``are motivated by both wanting to feel good about the
store they shop in and wanting the deals,'' Speranza said. ``So
while there will always be a place for price-and-item advertising,
we also need a strong place to develop the Toys `R' Us brand.''
</P>
<P>
   That accounts for the balance between hard and soft sell in the
company's ads. The quiz-show spoof is one of three commercials that
send up TV programming genres; a second is set in a police station
and a third in a hospital emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   The make-believe quiz show, in which Stempel appears as the
``celebrity judge,'' promotes what is billed as the ``Fifty Percent
Off Event,'' with 50 toys to be sold at half price at Toys ``R'' Us
stores. The spot was directed by Jim and Vezna Tozzi, the creators
of an amusing series of promotional commercials for the TV Land
cable network that pitched an imaginary product, Twip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's one of the funniest spots I've ever been
associated with,'' said Ms. Kaplan Thaler, president and chief
executive at Kaplan Thaler Group, who also handled creative
assignments for Toys ``R'' Us while working at the J. Walter
Thompson New York unit of WPP Group PLC and Wells BDDP.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people who recognize Herb Stempel,'' said Ms. Kaplan
Thaler, who wrote the ``I Don't Want to Grow Up'' jingle for the
toy chain, ``there's that added buzz'' that helps a spot ``break
through the clutter.''
</P>
<P>
   The other two TV spoofs for Toys ``R'' Us, which promote slick
sale catalogs, were directed by Jim Signorelli, who creates short
parodies for ``Saturday Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   Other commercials are more devoted to burnishing the Toys ``R''
Us brand image. One commercial, titled ``Remember When,'' is
focused on the company's 50th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   As viewers see gauzy, slow-motion shots of children involved in
such pleasant pursuits as jumping, blowing bubbles and playing
Twister, an announcer asks: ``Remember when you jumped 'cause you
wanted to and not because someone said so? When if somebody burst
your bubble, you just made more? When getting `bent out of shape'
was a good thing?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Toys `R' Us does,'' the announcer continues. ``And that's why
50 years later, we still believe that life _ at any age _ should be
fun.'' The spot, which ends with the theme ``Toys `R' Us, forever
fun,'' will begin running on Thanksgiving night, when the company
is the sole sponsor of a special presentation of the film
``Jumanji'' on the Fox network.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons a commercial like `Remember When' is
important,'' said Robin Koval, executive vice president and
client-services director at Kaplan Thaler Group, ``is to remind
people that, hey, we're talking about your kids here and making
them happy.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``There's a component that you're going to start to see more of
in the advertising,'' she added, ``of what's really wonderful about
Toys `R' Us.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the ads, Toys ``R'' Us is hoping to stimulate
sales with its first mail-order catalog, being sent to 2 million
households, and a retail Web site (www.toysrus.com). A test of
radio commercials by Kaplan Thaler Group to promote online selling
is under way.
</P>
<P>
   The holiday budget will be ``a little more than last year,''
Speranza said. ``It's aggressive, and it has to be, because this is
where we are going to make or break our year.''
</P>
<P>
   While Speranza declined to specify figures, according to the
Competitive Media Reporting ad-tracking firm, Toys ``R'' Us spent
$41.5 million on advertising in the fourth quarter of 1997,
compared with $42.1 million in the quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have a good Christmas,'' Speranza said, adding,
``Next year should be a terrific year for toys _ and hopefully, for
capital `T' Toys, for us,'' because of the reorganization as well
as the coming blitz of items related to the next film in the ``Star
Wars'' series set to be released by George Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   How about a quiz show devoted to ``Star Wars'' trivia with Darth
Vader as the celebrity judge?

   TRADING LOSSES DEPLETE PROFIT AT DEUTSCHE BANK
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank, said that it lost $136
million on trading in the securities of emerging markets, primarily
Russia, virtually obliterating its third-quarter profit. The bank
said net income for the quarter plunged 83.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Though analysts had known that Russian problems would take a
huge bite out of Deutsche Bank's profits, the results were even
worse than the two-thirds drop they had expected, and did little to
relieve the gloom that hovers over large banks in Europe and the
United States.

<P>
   INVESTORS APPLAUD CBS MOVE
</P>
<P>
   Investors in CBS appear to have faith that Mel Karmazin, the
company's new chief executive, has the ability to turn the company
around. Shares of CBS jumped 10.3 percent, to $28, the highest
level in six weeks, in the aftermath of the company's announcement
that Karmazin, who had been president, would take over.
</P>
<P>
   A CAUTIOUS RETURN TO STOCK FUNDS
</P>
<P>
   Mutual-fund investors tiptoed back into equities in September,
apparently encouraged as the stock market became less volatile and
equities regained some ground. But investors have generally
continued to demonstrate caution, funneling about as much new money
to bond funds and other conservative investments as to stocks.

   SOUTHWEST TO FLY TRANSCONTINENTAL

   DuPont, the biggest U.S. chemical company, agreed to buy the

biggest maker of auto paints.
</P>
<P>
   BOND PRICES RESUME CLIMBING
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices rose for the third time in four days as expectations
for slower economic growth, together with declines in Brazil's
stock market, kept demand alive for Treasuries. The yield of the
benchmark 30-year bond fell to 5.08 percent from 5.12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   OUTPUT DECLINES IN SINGAPORE
</P>
<P>
   Singapore, one of Asia's most resilient economies, has succumbed
to the region's economic turmoil. Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said
that the city-state's economy contracted in the third quarter by an
estimated 1.5 percent. It was the first quarter of reduced output
recorded in Singapore since the mid-1980s. With the contraction
expected to continue in the fourth quarter, Singapore seems likely
to fall into a recession.
</P>
<P>
   MCI WORLDCOM REPORTS A LOSS
</P>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom, the new telecommunications giant, lost $2.93
billion in the third quarter, mainly because of costs of Worldcom's
purchase of MCI Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Humana said it suffered a net loss of $30 million in the third

 &HT;    Will Skandalakis ads about Taylor backfire?
 &HT;    By Jay Croft and Sandra Eckstein
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The most controversial image in Campaign '98 looms
over the lieutenant governor's race with wider-ranging effects and
implications than ever intended.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than convincing voters that his Democratic opponent, Mark
Taylor, has a drug problem, ads by Republican Mitch Skandalakis
have taken on a life of their own as an issue that could help
decide the race.
</P>
<P>
   A TV spot includes the sign of Ridgeview Institute, a well-known
drug rehab center, and a later scene shows a shadowy figure of
Taylor's build walking down a nondescript hall. A voice says: ``We
all wish ... those problems had been cured,'' a reference to
Taylor's admission that he used cocaine and marijuana in the early
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor and many observers say the commercial strongly implies
the state senator was treated for addiction and still uses drugs,
all of which Taylor denies.
</P>
<P>
   Skandalakis has offered nothing to back up his accusations,
though when asked point-blank in a forum last week if he thought
Taylor was still using drugs, he responded: ``Yes, I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor has sued him for slander in Fulton County Superior Court,
seeking $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing the envelope
</P>
<P>
   Legally, nothing will be decided in the lawsuit until after
Tuesday's election. But politically, Skandalakis' ad and Taylor's
response raise questions not only about both men, but about the
nature of campaigning and how down-and-dirty voters are willing to
let candidates get, particularly Skandalakis.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's drug use is just one volley of Skandalakis' largely
negative campaign tactics. In another TV ad, he calls Atlanta Mayor
Bill Campbell ``an incompetent boob,'' and he has tied Taylor to
Atlanta's black political and gay communities. He's also settled
two other slander suits, including another filed during a political
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really pushes the envelope as to what's acceptable,'' said
Michael Binford, a campaign and elections expert at Georgia State
University. ``I don't know how you break the envelope with
political ads. I don't know that you can. You finally stop when you
realize that you don't win elections that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping quiet
</P>
<P>
   Skandalakis, who usually makes himself available to reporters,
has grown uncharacteristically quiet about substantiating his
implied claim about Taylor since being sued.
</P>
<P>
   At least a half dozen requests made to his campaign office and
his attorney, Robert Proctor, Tuesday and Wednesday to discuss the
issue went unanswered. When confronted about it at a news
conference Wednesday, Skandalakis said he wanted to discuss it, but
later his staff said that at the urging of Proctor he could not
discuss the issue because of Taylor's pending lawsuit. Fred Davis,
the California media consultant for Skandalakis, said the campaign
was contacted by a very credible source, who said they could
provide proof that Taylor continued to have a drug problem. He said
the decision was made to draw up the television commercial, and the
source was supposed to provide the proof in two or three days.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I know, that ad is dead accurate,'' Davis said.
``Someone very credible came to them with the implication they
could provide a document, then that person got cold feet and didn't
provide it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Davis said, the commercial was ready to go and
with the election only a few weeks away there was little time or
money to do another ad to replace it. Davis points out that the ad
never says Taylor has a drug problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just shows the sign through some trees and a guy who looks
like him (Taylor) in a hospital setting,'' Davis said. ``If you
assume it means that, you must know his history.''
</P>
<P>
   But Davis admits Skandalakis is now between a rock and a hard
place, having run the ad before getting verification.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's very sorry he ran the ad,'' Davis said. ``I don't
think he's sorry because it's wrong, but because he ran it before
he got verification.''
</P>
<P>
   Shooting from the hip
</P>
<P>
   Normally, Skandalakis, 40, of Sandy Springs, is one of the most
accessible elected officials in the area. He also is often
criticized as a politician who shoots from the hip and sometimes
shoots off his
</P>
<P>
   Image: goes here on so many lines
</P>
<P>
   (salinity)Continued fromC1
</P>
<P>
   mouth. He has referred to Martin Luther King III, whom he
defeated in the 1994 race to become Fulton County Commission
chairman, as ``a momma's boy'' and to Taylor as ``a big, fat,
spoiled baby.'' He has called various county employees ``idiot,''
``dolt'' and ``pencil-neck geek.''
</P>
<P>
   He prides himself on his ability to stir things up. So does
Proctor, a longtime friend and ally who most recently interceded in
Fulton's property tax collections by convincing a court that the
county did not set the millage rate properly so the county now must
collect 1998 taxes using the 1997 property values and millage rate.
</P>
<P>
   Skandalakis settled the earlier libel suits out of court.
</P>
<P>
   The first suit was filed in 1991 by the company that conducted
property revaluations for Fulton County. Skandalakis, at the fore
of a taxpayer revolt against the revaluations, accused the company
of charging Fulton for work done in another county and of buying
used equipment while charging the county for new gear. In the
settlement, which did not disclose if damages were paid,
Skandalakis said he had no evidence of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1995, Skandalakis and three others settled a lawsuit
by County Commissioner Gordon Joyner over an election flier that
depicted Joyner with exaggerated features including thicker lips
and an Afro.
</P>
<P>
   Skandalakis was not originally named in that lawsuit, but was
added after he admitted he paid for the flier. He also was fined by
the state ethics commission for surpassing the legal limit for
campaign contributions, because the flier cost more than $18,000,
and the limit is $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Skandalakis has been fined three times by the state ethics board
for campaign violations, mostly for failing to fill out campaign
disclosures properly.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Taylor sued Skandalakis over the drug allegations,
which the South Georgian said ``are character assassination'' that
go ``beyond the realm of politics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mitch Skandalakis' ad does not have a grain of truth to it,''
added Taylor, who has produced a letter from Ridgeview, where
Skandalakis claims Taylor spent time in December 1997. The letter
says the hospital can find no record of Taylor ever receiving
treatment there.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital attorney Dan Reinhardt said the hospital, at Taylor's
written request, searched for anyone with Taylor's name, Social
Security number or birthday, and found no one. Reinhardt said he
did not know if it was possible for Taylor to be admitted under
another name, but Taylor swears he has never been in a rehab
center.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, 41, admits he used cocaine and marijuana in the early
'80s, but insists there has been no drug use since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a member of the General Assembly, I have taken a drug test
every two years since 1990, and they've all been negative,'' said
Taylor, a 11-year state senator from Albany.
</P>
<P>
   His staff produced his most recent drug test, taken Oct. 7, that
shows Taylor had no drugs in his system. ``I used drugs when I was
young and childish, and I was blessed that I was never arrested or
addicted.''
</P>
<P>
   The drug issue arose when papers from Taylor's 1988 divorce were
mailed to a newspaper earlier this year. Shortly after he got
custody of their son in January, Robin Virginia Coble Taylor filed
a motion for visitation, claiming she was having problems seeing
the teen.
</P>
<P>
   The petition also alleges that Taylor was not properly
supervising the boy, ``which has resulted in the deterioration of
his grades at school and his detrimental exposure to alcohol, drugs
and sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said he will submit a written medical disclosure form to
``any rehab hospital anywhere in the galaxy'' if Skandalakis or the
press request it to prove he hasn't been treated for drug
addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Virginia Coble Taylor, declined to discuss Taylor or their
divorce. Her attorney, Pamela Tremayne, said Taylor's ex-wife is
looking out for the best interest of the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say Taylor is unlikely to win his lawsuit and
predict he will dismiss it after the election, although Taylor
insists he will not.
</P>
<P>
   Courts have made it clear they should not be ``judging the
veracity of campaign charges,'' said political analyst Larry Sabato
of the University of Virginia. ``The Supreme Court has said that
some forms of speech are critical to the functioning of a healthy
democracy, and political speech is clearly one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Suits like Taylor's are unusual but not unheard of. This week,
U.S. Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri was sued by his underdog
opponent, William J. Federer, over ads challenging Federer's
record. In Maryland's 1994 Republican primary, Senate candidate
Ruthann Aron sued her opponent after he said she was ``convicted''
and ``guilty'' in a previous lawsuit that had, in fact, been
settled. A jury rejected her claim that rival Bill Brock committed
slander.
</P>
<P>
   Voters steadily say they don't like negative campaigning, even
when most of it is about a campaigner's public record and based, at
least in some measure, on a verifiable fact.
</P>
<P>
   Skandalakis may be testing voters' patience by going after
Taylor's personal life and offering nothing as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand why Taylor would be upset,'' Binford said.
``But is it libel or likely to be proven in a court of law?
Probably not.''
</P>
<P>
   To win his lawsuit, Taylor must prove that Skandalakis knew his
ad was false or acted recklessly, a tougher standard than the mere
negligence private citizens must prove. A long suit would be costly
_ and would open Taylor to potentially embarrassing questions in
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have lived less than a saintly life, it's probably not
a good idea to bring a libel suit,'' said William Lee, a professor
of communications law at the University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   But experts say Taylor's lawsuit has helped him politically. It
has lead some to question the integrity of Skandalakis' ad, making
it an issue for voters _ moreso than the courts _ to decide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only way to judge,'' Sabato said. ``The limits are
enforced by voters on election day. Let's see what happens on
Tuesday.

PLANO'S RAY LANDS RIDE WITH A TOP IRL TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After two seasons of scrambling for full-time sponsorship money,
Plano's Greg Ray has landed one of the premier rides in the Pep
Boys Indy Racing League.
</P>
<P>
   Ray has signed a five-year contract with Indianapolis-based Team
Menard, where he will replace 1997 IRL champion Tony Stewart. The
deal reunites Ray with former team owner/crew chief Thomas Knapp,
who joined Menard as general manager on Oct. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, 32, will be the sole driver for millionaire businessman/car
owner John Menard in 1999. Stewart, who won two races and finished
third in the driver's championship this year, will run the full
NASCAR Winston Cup schedule in 1999. Robbie Buhl, who drove for
Menard the last two years, has not been retained. Menard drivers
have scored nine poles and four victories since the IRL's inception
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thrilled to be working for John, since the Menard team is
one of the best around,'' said Ray, who has been testing at the
Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The team will run the Dallara chassis,
Oldsmobile Aurora V-8 and Firestone Firehawk tire package. Ray's
engine program will be overseen by Butch Meyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely ready for the winner's circle,'' said Ray, who
finished 21st in points after competing in nine of 11 races for
Knapp (seven events) and A.J. Foyt Enterprises (two) in place of
the injured Billy Boat.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, who qualified No. 2 for the Indy 500 in May, posted his
career-best IRL finish _ second to Boat _ during the True Value
500K night race at Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth on June 6.

RETURN TO SENDER, ADDRESS SALT LAKE CITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There's new reason to believe the NBA lockout will
end sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   If any players listened to ``The Karl Malone'' radio show
emanating this week from Burbank, they've got to be calling an
emergency meeting to settle this thing _ because there's no way
they can afford to have this stammering contradiction of a
pseudo-radio host continue to present the players' side and risk
that whatever NBA fans there are left might decide never to come
back.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the novelty hasn't quite worn off of AM-1150's experiment
_ giving the Utah Jazz's star his own two hours of airtime to do
... whatever he's been doing. But given another week, ratings will
only show that it's because listeners are from the same universe as
those who watched ``The Magic Hour'' fish-tail through its two
humiliating months of original shows and another month of reruns.
</P>
<P>
   As sports-talk radio devolves further into this
call-attention-to-ourselves celebrity quagmire, the hucksters at
AM-1150 should back-slap themselves for giving this future Hall of
Famer a chance to refer to himself in the third person for two
hours a day. The regular host, Vic ``The Bootlicking'' Jacobs, even
relinquished the name of his own show for this Southern-drawling,
grammatically challenged opportunist.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for Malone's insight and insider information
on the NBA players and owners labor woes, as the station has
advertised, you might as well tune in to Art Bell rattling on about
extraterrestrials.
</P>
<P>
   During his first week on the air, Malone has ``enlightened us''
(Jacobs' words) about his car dealerships, his love of Harleys and
Mack trucks and ``wrasslin', '' fishing and hunting. (And by the
way, Charlton Heston's outstanding leadership of the NRA).
</P>
<P>
   Malone has also bestowed his much-sought takes on world events
such as 77-year-old John Glenn's leap back into space (``I wish at
75 I could be doing that when I'm that age''), President Clinton's
travails (``How much more can you degrade Clinton, which is from
Arkansas'') and Texas governor George Bush II's chances of becoming
the nation's chief executive (``I've done my homework, and this
would be the first father-son to be president in history'').
</P>
<P>
   But when the conversation painfully turns back to NBA issues,
the facts are incidental to what he decides will come spilling out
of his mouth. Unfortunately, there's absolutely no one brave enough
to correct him _ especially Jacobs, who until recently had been
calling Malone the league's ``Most Valuable Baby'' because of his
off-the-court outbursts. Even if the station knows someone like Joe
McDonnell wouldn't get along on-air with Malone, at least the
conversation would be interesting.
</P>
<P>
   When he's on his new audio soapbox, Malone loves to go on about
what he believes is the unjust split of $3 billion. He maintains
the players should get $1.5 billion and the owners, even though
they take the bigger financial risks, should receive the other $1.5
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Someone might remind Malone that the money the NBA players and
owners have been talking about is closer to $2 billion. But we
digress.
</P>
<P>
   The most annoying thing the unfiltered Malone continues to do is
drop extremely loud hints about leaving the Jazz after this season
(when he'll be a free agent) to become a Laker. Even Malone and his
new agent/activities director Dwight Manley must realize his
becoming a Laker is practically impossible with the league's
present salary caps, hard or soft. Jacobs can continue to harp
about how unjust it is that Elden Campbell makes a million a year
more than Malone, but those are the contracts that Malone has
signed without a gun to his head.
</P>
<P>
   As long as Jacobs' built-in gullible listening audience in L.A.
continues to accept Malone's spewings, playing them off the fans in
Utah who are terrified of losing him, the topic continues to be out
there for discussion. Or at least for Malone to dance around. How
compelling is that?
</P>
<P>
   Since the show is simulcast to Salt Lake City station KALL-AM
(910) _ a demand that Malone made _ the callers who do get the most
air time are those from places like Ogden, Provo and Logan.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, there was even a ``caller from Albuquerque'' that
Jacobs introduced, but who turned out be a guy named Wade who is
the general manager of Malone's car dealership down there and
admitted the station called him to come on.
</P>
<P>
   Awash in the glee that he has control of the dump button to rid
himself of callers who challenge him, Malone loves to reiterate
that ``this is my show, not yours,'' and then allowing Jacobs to
chime in about how a caller ``had too much hostility and a hidden
agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   That, and he made too much sense.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, if Malone wants any career in this field after his
playing days, the Mailman will have to work on more than just his
delivery. This audio ``pick and roll'' he has going with Jacobs is
brutal enough to draw a technical foul from any listener. Without
the NBA hook, Malone is just another 50,000-watt ego with nothing
to say.
</P>
<P>
   If this ruse is what AM-1150 wants to call taking it to the next
level, leave us off on this floor, thanks.
</P>
<P>
   Our sympathy, too, to the nice people in Salt Lake City who must
endure not only Malone on a regular basis but now Jacobs for this
limited time.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and just remember the time you spend listening to the Karl
Malone show might be better spent changing the cat box with those
shredded boxes of Rogaine.
</P>
<P>
   At least there's a chance Malone will grow on you from that
end. &QL;

Clipper Classic _ an overtime victory against San Antonio from
December 1997 _ that will air Sunday at 10 p.m. Then, Monday at 8
p.m., Fox Sports West has the Lakers' decisive Game 6 win over
Boston from the 1985 NBA Finals. FSW was supposed to carry 36
Lakers regular-season games starting with Wednesday's opener
against Minnesota; FSW2's first of 40 Clippers games was to be
against Vancouver a week from Saturday.

MISSOURI CASINOS' FUTURE TO BE SHAPED BY VOTERS' DEFINITION OF
RIVER

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The mighty rivers running through the state of
Missouri have inspired great legends, served as literary metaphors
and stirred the creative will of many who laid eyes on them. But
for people who inhabit the landscape around the Mississippi and
Missouri rivers, the ability to imagine these swift waters as
anything other than what they actually are is being pushed to new
limits.
</P>
<P>
   To casino operators, these majestic rivers should be considered
to include the odd-shaped artificial ponds, dug by the casino
companies themselves and tenuously attached to the real rivers with
long, skinny man-made channels.
</P>
<P>
   The practice allows gambling companies to comply with state laws
limiting casinos to craft that ply the two riverways. The ponds,
they contend, are part of the rivers. And the casinos that sit in
them are duly called ``boats'' _ never mind that they have no
captains, they don't sail anywhere _ they couldn't even if someone
wanted them to _ and some of them, with their parking lots,
theaters and restaurants, look more like huge shopping malls than
sailing vessels.
</P>
<P>
   To the people here who oppose casino gambling, the casinos and
the ponds in which they sit are nothing other than a ruse.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, in an election being watched by proponents and
opponents of gambling nationwide, the rest of Missouri residents
will be asked to weigh in on the issue. Voters will decide if the
``boats in moats,'' as they are known, are an acceptable
alternative to the ``riverboats'' that were approved by voters when
gambling was legalized here in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The ballot proposal is the gambling industry's response to a
state Supreme Court ruling last year holding that ``games of
chance,'' like slot machines, could only be offered on the main
channels of the rivers. Voters are being asked to amend the state
constitution to broaden the definition of a river to include
``artificial spaces that contain water and that are within 1,000
feet'' of the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beyond ridiculous,'' said Stephen Ambrose, the author of
``Undaunted Courage,'' a book about the Lewis and Clark expedition
along the Missouri River. ``If you're going to legalize gambling,
then legalize gambling and let them build. It's hypocritical. These
are not real rivers and they're not real riverboats.''
</P>
<P>
   But to the Missouri gambling industry, the matter is no joke. If
next week's measure fails, then 11 of the state's 15 casino
operations stand to lose their licenses permitting games of chance
like slot machines _ which account for most of the companies'
revenues.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The casinos in artificial ponds are only one of the many ways
that casino companies around the nation bend the rules in an effort
to adhere to laws that would otherwise limit their ability to do
business.
</P>
<P>
   As the industry has sought to grow around the nation, it has
followed a pattern of first assuaging voter concern by agreeing to
live within certain limitations _ but then later either redefining
those limits or asking that they be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri and some other states, casino development is limited
to certain waterways to keep casinos from overtaking the landscape.
In some states, the riverboats are also required to cruise for a
set period of time each day _ making it difficult, according to
gambling opponents, for compulsive gamblers to repeatedly get on
and off the boats.
</P>
<P>
   But in Louisiana, for example, the huge riverboats, with names
like the Treasure Chest and the Belle of Orleans, often stay at or
near the dock, even in good weather. This is because, casino
officials say, the casinos lose about 25 percent of their customers
when they cruise. Sometimes the boats simply take what is called a
``ghost cruise,'' in which they close the door, pull a few yards
away from the dock, and sit there for the entire 90-minute
``cruise.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Riverport Casino Center located just outside St. Louis,
gamblers never even see the river as they drive up to the property,
or after they enter the building that houses the restaurants and
shops. However, before they can walk onto the casino floor, they
must wait for a sign to flash ``Now Boarding.'' Once it stops
flashing, no one else can come inside while the casino's phantom
cruise is underway.
</P>
<P>
   After Missouri voters had already approved the ``gambling
excursions'' on the rivers, the casino operators began to complain
that there was too much commercial traffic on the rivers, that the
rivers often flooded, and that passenger safety would be at risk if
the boats actually cruised. They wanted to attach their casinos to
the large restaurant and entertainment venues that account for an
increasing share of the industry's revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had the choice, why would you want to absorb the cost
and the risk of cruising if you didn't have to?'' asked Dean
Hestermann, manager of public policy analysis at Harrah's
Entertainment, operator of four Missouri casinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our constitution is being sold out for the benefit of a big
industry,'' said Mark Andrews, chairman of Show Me The River, the
campaign organization leading the opposition to the ballot
proposal. Echoing the words used by the Supreme Court, he insisted,
``A river is a river.''
</P>
<P>
   When Missouri voters first considered legalizing casino
riverboats, the the gambling industry painted a picture of a
nostalgic return to the days of Mark Twain, when gamblers plied the
Mississippi on paddle boats. And at first, the casinos did use
boats that cruised the river.
</P>
<P>
   But increasingly, they began to interpret the language of the
law in a broader manner. As long as the actual gambling area of the
casino developments floated on water that was connected to the
river, they argued, then gambling was still being restricted to
boats on the river. Local gaming regulators, for their part,
concurred with the interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   Initially the boats were only allowed to operate so-called games
of skill, like poker and blackjack. In November 1994, however, the
casino industry won voter approval to operate ``games of chance,''
the main one being the popular, and lucrative, slot machine.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Then, a 1996 lawsuit filed by a state representative and a local
minister charged that casino riverboats that offered games of
chance, but did not actually sit in the river were
unconstitutional. Last November, the state Supreme Court agreed
with the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   For the casino industry in Missouri and elsewhere, such battles
are crucial. Missouri casinos, which generate $800 million a year
in revenues, have already invested $1.7 billion in developing their
properties in the state and 11 of the 15 licensed operators here
would lose their right to operate slot machines if the ballot
measure fails. Games like poker and blackjack would be allowed to
continue inside the casinos, but with an estimated 70 percent of
their revenues coming from slot machines, casino companies have
said that they would be forced to shut down if voters don't agree
to change the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like telling McDonald's hamburgers you can stay open but
you can't serve sandwiches,'' said Don Poston, spokesman for
Missourians for Fairness and Jobs, the political committee
campaigning in favor of the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opponents of this are not constitutional purists,'' Poston
said. ``These people want to get rid of gaming. That's their goal.
They don't want anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the measure say that its defeat could lead to the
elimination of about 10,000 jobs and cost the state and local
governments $170 million a year in tax revenues. Both pro- and
anti-gambling forces across the country are watching the Missouri
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the definitive battle,'' said Tom Grey, a Methodist
minister who is executive director of the National Coalition
Against Gambling Expansion. ``If we beat their money and muscle,
then tell me the truth isn't on our side.'' Grey said that gambling
opponents are already considering similar challenges elsewhere in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``How big is this?'' he asked. ``It's everything.''
</P>
<P>
   With a campaign that has already spent $8 million, supporters of
Amendment Nine, as the ballot proposal is called, are blanketing
the state with advertisements. Their ads make no mention of
casinos, boats, moats, or basins. All along the state's highways,
colorful billboards bearing the faces of workers simply proclaim:
``Vote Yes on 9 for Fairness and Jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign to defeat the measure has been funded with only
about $120,000, with at least ten percent of it coming from the
personal bank account of Andrews, a wealthy local businessman.
Despite the disparity in spending, a recent poll conducted by the
St. Louis Post-Dispatch found, voters are evenly split on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're hunkered down in a bunker and they're throwing out
millions of dollars in ads,'' said Steve Taylor, a spokesman for
Show Me the River. Despite the casino industry's ``massive amounts
of money,'' he said, ``I think it's going to be close.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Riverport Casino Center, the stilted efforts to
adhere to the law are evident. Past the restaurants and shops are
entrances to four different casinos, two owned and operated by
Harrah's Entertainment and two by Players International. The casino
floors are actually huge barges that float inside the basins.
Because of the seamless floor between the land-based restaurants
and shops and the barges themselves, however, customers may never
know they are actually on a barge when they walk onto the casino
floor.
</P>
<P>
   As he showed a visitor around the back offices of the casino
development, Earl Strauther, the community affairs manager for
Harrah's, asked, ``You want to see the river?'' Stepping outside
onto a concrete courtyard where employees were eating their lunches
and taking cigarette breaks, he walked towards the back wall of one
of the barges, and there, in between the barge and the concrete
courtyard, was a 10-foot wide channel of greasy water with paper
cups and other debris floating on top. ``If you look close,''
Strauther said, leaning over a protective metal railing, ``You'll
even see some fish.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal prosecutors have filed secret charges against
a former sergeant in the U.S. Special Forces who is suspected of
switching sides in the war against terrorism and joining the global
campaign to attack Americans mounted by the Saudi exile Osama bin
Laden.
</P>
<P>
   The charges are part of federal authorities' efforts to prove
that bin Laden was behind the bombings of two U.S. embassies in
Africa in August, and a series of other attacks against U.S.
soldiers in Somalia, Saudi Arabia and Yemen.
</P>
<P>
   They draw new ties between bin Laden and a circle of Islamic
militants in Brooklyn, who were implicated in the World Trade
Center bombing and a plot to blow up the United Nations and other
New York landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   The former Special Forces sergeant, Ali Mohamed, was charged in
September in a closed court hearing in Manhattan, and remains in
custody at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, according to law
enforcement officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Officials declined to provide details about the charges against
Mohamed and it was not clear when he became linked to bin Laden or
whether he knew of _or took part in _ any of the group's attacks
against American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   In what appears to be a related development, prosecutors
investigating bin Laden are negotiating a possible plea agreement
with another man, a former associate of Mohamed's who was arrested
this year in suburban Washington, according to court records. Such
a deal could be intended to secure testimony about Mohamed or his
circle.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials declined to say why they are proceeding in
secret against Mohamed, a native of Egypt, as they build a case
against bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   On occasion, prosecutors file charges under court seal when they
are pressuring a defendant to cooperate with authorities and want
to avoid alerting other suspects in the case. A significant number
of bin Laden's lieutenants remain at large.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed, 46, served for three years at the Army's Special Forces
base in Fort Bragg, N.C., and was honorably discharged from the
service in 1989, according to military records and interviews. His
records show that his duties ranged from clerical work to
instructing soldiers headed for the Middle East about Islamic
culture.
</P>
<P>
   A witness at the 1995 trial of the Islamic militants accused of
plotting to blow up New York landmarks testified that Mohamed
traveled to New York while on active duty and provided military
training to local Muslims preparing to fight the Soviet forces in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The witness said the students included El Sayyid Nosair, the
Egyptian immigrant convicted of killing Rabbi Meir Kahane, the
founder of the Jewish Defense League, in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1995 trial the government said Mohamed's 1989 visits
to the New York area were not part of his official duties. No
charges were brought against him.
</P>
<P>
   At some point in the 1990s, the secret charges against Mohamed
suggest, he became enmeshed in bin Laden's group, which is known as
al Qaeda. A federal magistrate in New York has refused to make the
charges against him publicly available.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, declined to
comment on either case or respond to any questions about the court
secrecy. Officials at the FBI also declined to discuss the cases.
Mohamed's lawyer, James Roth, said he had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors in New York have been building a case
against bin Laden's organization since at least 1995. Their efforts
intensified in August after bombers believed to be linked to the
wealthy Saudi attacked the American embassies in Tanzania and
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   In the months that followed, agents from the FBI fanned out
around the world, seeking to arrest anyone with financial or
operational ties to bin Laden or his network. Prosecutors have
asserted in court papers that bin Laden's organization grew in part
from the Alkifah Refugee Center in Brooklyn, where prosecutors say
a cadre of Islamic militants gathered to plot a series of terrorist
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Charges have been brought in New York against three people
accused of bombing the U.S. embassies in East Africa. Four other
men, including Mohamed, have been charged in bin Laden's previous
attacks against Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden himself has been secretly indicted in the terrorism
investigation, law enforcement officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Afghanistan is a common thread for bin Laden, and
nearly all of those charged with the embassy bombings fought in the
jihad, or holy war, against the Soviet forces occupying the
country.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed's military record and other documents describe an
unusual career. He was born in Kafr El Sheik, Egypt, and attended a
military academy before serving as an officer in Egypt from 1971 to
1984. The records say he is fluent in Arabic, Hebrew, English and
French, and worked for 18 months as a security adviser to Egyptair
after leaving the Egyptian army.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed entered the United States in September 1985 and became a
permanent resident soon after. He enlisted in the Army in August of
the following year.
</P>
<P>
   A powerfully built dark-haired man, Mohamed received a
commendation his first year for ``exceptional performance'' on the
Army's physical training test. He spent his three years in the Army
with the Special Forces units at Fort Bragg, which include both
military trainers and elite commando units, such as the Army
Rangers or Delta Force.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed, the records say, was involved in training and lectured
soldiers being deployed to the Middle East on the region's culture
and politics. He also helped make and appeared in some training
videotapes about the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   In one tape, he is dressed in civilian clothes, and fluently
answers a series of questions from several higher-ranking officers
about Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran. Mohamed asserts that the
world has no true Islamic nation, that ``Islam cannot survive
without political domination'' and that devout Muslims are widely
misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The term of fundamentalism scares people in the West,'' he
declares at one point. ``Everybody when he hears fundamentalist, he
thinks about armed struggle. He thinks about radicals. He thinks
about groups that are carrying weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``The word fundamentalism does not mean extremism.
It means just that ordinary Muslims accept everything _ that this
is my way.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his supervisors at Fort Bragg, Norvell De Atkine, said in
an interview that Mohamed was a man of strong views. ``I don't
think he was anti-American,'' recalled De Atkine, a retired
colonel. ``He was what I would call a Muslim fundamentalist, which
isn't a bomb thrower,'' he added. ``I would not put him in that
category.''
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed's name publicly surfaced in the 1995 trial of a group of
defendants charged with plotting to blow up the New York landmarks.
Among the accused was Nosair, who was charged both with killing
Kahane and with taking part in the broader plot.
</P>
<P>
   Nosair mounted an unusual defense. His lawyer asserted that his
activities were part of an American-sponsored covert operation to
train and arm the Afghan rebels fighting the Soviet Union. The link
between Nosair and the American government, his lawyer said, was
Mohamed, who came to the New York area and trained several Islamic
militants at an apartment in Jersey City, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Nosair's lawyer called as a witness an Egyptian electrical
engineer who said he had been among a group of men trained by
Mohamed in the spring and fall of 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The witness, Khalid Ibrahim, testified at the 1995 trial that
Mohamed went by the name of Abu Omar and gave the group military
training in survival techniques, map reading and how to recognize
tanks and other Soviet weapons. Ibrahim indicated that Mohamed gave
the group several Army manuals that described how to throw grenades
while kneeling and make booby traps with explosives.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Ibrahim said, he traveled to Pakistan to join the
Afghan rebels, moving his family and children to the border city of
Peshawar. A year later, in the fall of 1992, Ibrahim said he
encountered Mohamed at one of the rebels' mountain training camps
in Afghanistan, near Khost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like he had come from someplace else,'' Ibrahim
testified. ``I mean like overseas maybe, and he was there to train
some of their people, some of their commanders.''
</P>
<P>
   The camps at Khost were built with U.S. assistance. They were
constructed in the 1980s by Afghan rebels, who received about $3
billion from the CIA, which funneled the aid to the rebels through
Pakistan throughout the 1980s
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, after his name surfaced at the landmarks trial, The
Boston Globe reported that Mohamed had been admitted to the United
States under a special visa program controlled by the CIA's
clandestine service. It said he had also made claims of having
worked for the agency. A connection to the CIA could not be
independently verified, and an agency spokesman declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   The camps at Khost have been used in recent years by bin Laden's
associates and other radical Islamic organizations, and were
attacked last August with cruise missiles to retaliate for the
embassy bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, a scion of a wealthy Saudi family, left his native
land to help the rebels in Afghanistan in 1980 and for the next 10
years often traveled to Peshawar, the staging area for the war.
</P>
<P>
   From 1989 to 1991, prosecutors have asserted in a recent
indictment in the embassy bombing case, bin Laden's al Qaeda group
operated from Peshawar and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   It could not be learned whether the paths of bin Laden and
Mohamed crossed in Afghanistan or in Peshawar.
</P>
<P>
   From about 1991 to 1996 bin Laden lived in Sudan, where he
trained and supported several hundred Arabs from various countries
who fought in Afghanistan and, prosecutors assert, carried out a
series of attacks against Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudi exile's activities quickly attracted the attention of
federal investigators, who by the late 1990s were scouring the
world for witnesses and associates.
</P>
<P>
   One of those they appear to have begun pressuring several months
before the embassy bombings was Ibrahim, of Herndon, Va. He was
arrested on May 11 and charged in Manhattan with one count of
making false statements in 1990 on the immigration papers of
Mohammad Salameh, one of those later convicted in the 1993 bombing
of the Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim's lawyer declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   One of the prosecutors spearheading the investigation of the
embassy attacks, Kenneth Karas, said in a recent hearing in federal
district court in Manhattan that the government was involved in
``extensive discussions'' about a plea bargain, and that ``we were
prepared to offer Ibrahim a disposition that would be termed
mutually beneficial.''

LAUNCH NOTEBOOK: IN GLENN FLIGHT, HYPE AND MAGIC BLEND

<P>
   During the weeklong media drumbeat leading to John Glenn's
voyage into space, the former astronaut Scott Carpenter described
one benefit of the flight. As he told MSNBC, ``The nation gets to
revisit a time of imagination and hope and magic.'' That sounds
more like a description of a Disney film than rocket science, yet
it succinctly captures the gilded tone of the television coverage
up to and including Thursday's high-profile launching. The networks
and all-news channels quickly found their common theme: the return
of an American hero. And after 10 months of wallowing in the
Lewinsky sex scandal, you could almost feel their relief as they
leaped on this wholesome story.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade television news has virtually ignored space
unless a satellite seemed about to tumble from the sky. But all
week the network newscasts have been sounding the puffy theme of
heroism, interviewing Glenn and doing features on his historic
flight in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   And while Tom Brokaw, Dan Rather and Peter Jennings were all
there for the launching Thursday, the story was shaped by other
voices, from the past. A medium devoted to youth suddenly had an
amazing amount of gray hair on display, as former astronauts turned
television commentators. There was Carpenter on NBC, Wally Shirra
on ABC and James Lovell on the Fox News Channel. It says a lot
about how we have come to perceive the space program that Lovell
may be best identified as the guy Tom Hanks played in ``Apollo
13.'' Most nostalgic of all, covering the flight for CNN was Walter
Cronkite, who at 82 is five years older than Glenn and a far more
beloved icon.
</P>
<P>
   There is conspicuous irony, even wrongheadedness, in the way a
future-oriented endeavor like space travel has been cloaked in this
nostalgic glow. The hoopla over the Glenn flight says a great deal
about the media and this social moment. The last year has seen
several attempts at media-manufactured heros. The popularity of
Steven Spielberg's World War II movie ``Saving Private Ryan'' was
depicted as a longing for old-time heros. So was Mark McGwire's
race to break Roger Maris' home-run record. The cover of this
week's TV Guide pictures Glenn and Cronkite with a headline that
reflects the television coverage: ``A Time for Heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   How much this feeds a genuine public thirst, and how much comes
from the media trying desperately to counterbalance its Lewinsky
coverage, may be an unanswerable question. But there are many hints
of media desperation. Glenn has always inspired greater respect for
his place in history than the warmth and affection that the most
popular heros evoke.
</P>
<P>
   And as the week went on, it became impossible to ignore the
skeptics' questions: Was Glenn part of a valid scientific study? Or
was his trip about politics and public relations? To the reporters'
credit, those questions were not ignored. But they could never
become dominant; television was invested in enticing viewers to
watch a genuine hero. Subtly, the questions shifted. Even if the
science is makework, Brian Williams asked on MSNBC, ``Does John
Glenn deserve his victory lap?'' Rather simply added public
relations to the equation, and signed off CBS' coverage by calling
it ``a history-making, publicity-making, sentimental science trip
to space.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the weeklong television buildup didn't create excitement
so much as it made the smooth countdown and launching seem
perfunctory. We are accustomed to seeing space televised in more
dramatic terms, whether in Hank's popular miniseries, ``From the
Earth to the Moon,'' with its glittering views of the Earth as seen
from space, or NASA's own astonishing live television pictures from
Mars last year. Listening to anchors and astronauts explaining the
details of the flight Thursday seemed anticlimactic.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if you're going to throw a nostalgia-fest, you might as well
have a loved figure like Cronkite around. His very presence, in his
own well-earned victory lap, seemed more notable than anything he
or any other reporter had to say, and captured the nostalgic
essence of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers expecting Cronkite to take charge of the coverage were
bound to be disappointed, though. The hard truth is that he spoke a
bit more slowly and seemed less energetic than he used to. And
CNN's anchor, Miles O'Brien, seemed slightly uncomfortable through
the day, sitting between Cronkite and other gray-haired guests.
</P>
<P>
   In his most substantial contribution, Cronkite interviewed
President Clinton, who said politics played no role in the
selection of Glenn for this flight and that he would ask Congress
for additional money to keep the planned international space
station in business if the collapse of the Russian economy calls
for it.
</P>
<P>
   And it was strangely satisfying to see Cronkite compete with
himself. At one odd moment, the taped Cronkite was on CBS, being
interviewed by his successor, Rather. Meanwhile, the live Cronkite
was interviewing the legendary test pilot, Chuck Yaeger, on CNN.
Both interviews, of course, were about the past.
</P>
<P>
   For all the backward looks at 1962, the coverage glossed over
the public relations and politics that shaped that Cold War era.
The need to beat the Russians drove the space race, and the pride
in Glenn's orbiting the Earth came with constant fear that the evil
Russians would blow the Earth to bits. So much for hope and magic.
</P>
<P>
   Yet after all the fuss, Thursday's launching did look magical.
``However you felt about John Glenn and his mission,'' Brokaw
astutely observed in his sign-off on NBC, ``I am confident that it
must have changed when those big solid rocket boosters lit up and
he left for space at the age of 77.'' It was a sight spectacular
beyond hype. For that brief time, the ``Hero Aboard'' slogans fell
away and the wondrous accomplishment of space travel blazed
through.

SAILER IMPROVED AFTER KICKING WORKOUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILMER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA kicker Chris Sailer did something Wednesday
he had not done in four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He kicked.
</P>
<P>
   And that _ not his 45-yard extra point at Cal _ is the best
indication of Sailer's recovery from a strained groin suffered
Sept. 30 in a post-practice kicking exhibition for television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling really good, actually,'' said Sailer, a senior
from Notre Dame High. ``I can't guarantee I'll ever be 100 percent
because of the wear and tear of games. But it's getting better. I'm
a good 80-to-85 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   When Sailer missed a 21-yard field goal two weeks ago against
Oregon _ he later made the game-winner from 24 yards in overtime _
his right leg was hovering near 50 percent. He walked with a limp
and kicked with a cringe.
</P>
<P>
   Daily treatment and plenty of rest have fueled his speedy
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the Oregon game to the Cal game, it felt twice as good,''
he said. ``Obviously, it's not perfect yet, but it got a lot better
in a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Sailer erased any doubts by drilling three penalty-propelled
extra points (from 35, 40 and 45 yards) in the first quarter at
Cal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like pregame warmups, when the kicks are five yards
here and five yards there,'' he said. ``They weren't my normal
kicks, but I'm getting it back slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   __ No nickel?: Sophomore Marques Anderson responded well to his
demotion from starting cornerback to nickel back (a third
cornerback used in passing situations). Anderson made five tackles
and broke up three passes against Cal, and he was named UCLA's
special-teams player of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Now, how will he respond to a sprained big toe on his right
foot?
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is questionable for Stanford, which has attempted more
passes than any team in the Pac-10. If he can't play, junior Eric
Whitfield becomes the nickel back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's better, but he hasn't practiced all week,'' coach Bob
Toledo said of Anderson. ``It's a 3:30 game, so we have all day
Friday and all Saturday morning for treatment. But we can't count
on him right now.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Ready, set, wait: Freshman tailback DeShaun Foster practiced
this week and moved well on his sprained left knee. He's available,
but the Bruins probably won't use him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plan is not to play him unless we get injuries to a bunch
of tailbacks and we don't have anybody to play,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Jermaine Lewis will start, with Keith Brown and walk-on Mark
Reynosa in reserve.
</P>
<P>
   __ Pep talk: Toledo spoke to freshman cornerback Julius Williams
earlier this week about his tentative play. Williams responded with
his best practice of the season Wednesday despite a sore back.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be afraid to make mistakes and I think he's
realizing that,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is UCLA's fifth cornerback, behind Jason Bell, Ryan
Roques, Eric Whitfield and Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury update: Despite a slew of aches and pains, only two
regulars won't play: Foster and oft-injured linebacker Michael
Wiley.
</P>
<P>
   __ Short stuff: The first 10,000 fans entering on the Rose
Bowl's east side will receive a Cade McNown fan mask.... Between
the first and second quarters, UCLA will honor Dr. Louis J.
Ignarro, who won the Nobel Prize for medicine.... Defensive line
coach Terry Tumey turned 33 on Thursday. Yes, it's been 12 years
since Tumey, a nose guard, was named All-Pac-10 for the third (and
final) time.... A crowd in excess of 60,000 is expected, so arrive
early in the congested Arroyo. As usual, shuttle service is
available from the Parsons Engineering Building in Pasadena to the
Rose Bowl.

EDITORIAL: REFORM IN BRAZIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial Friday, Oct. 30: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because Brazil is the largest economy in Latin America, its
success or failure will always be important to its hemispheric
neighbors. But seldom has its fate seemed as significant as now,
when the world fears that the financial crisis that began in Asia
will spread to the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   The world, through the International Monetary Fund, should
provide aid to Brezil, but only if the country first takes needed
steps to get its own fiscal house in order. The reforms proposed by
its newly re-elected president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, are long
overdue and vitally necessary. But Cardoso may have a difficult
time getting them adopted by the Congress and the state
governments, and they will not bring an early economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The reforms provide for raising some taxes and getting a rein on
the country's pension system, which has benefited government
employees and pensioners at the expense of the rest of the country.
The failure to make reforms has led to large budget deficits that
cannot be sustained. There may be room for modifying the
president's plan, but if Brazil's politicians fail to pass
something similar to it, they will do their country a disservice.
</P>
<P>
   This is, at best, an awkward time for Brazil to be facing fiscal
stringency. Its economy has already been weakened by
extraordinarily high interest rates that were imposed to protect
its overvalued currency, the real, and this package will allow
interest rates to be lowered only gradually. The country would be
far better off had Cardoso been able to push through such reforms
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The government insists that a devaluation of the real will not
be considered, and it is easy to understand why. Cardoso's
reputation is based on controlling inflation, which was done by
linking the real to the dollar in a way that allows it to lose no
more than about 7 percent of its value each year. A devaluation
would not only provide a boost to inflation, but would risk
destroying faith in the currency.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, everyone now knows the real is overvalued, and that has
led to capital flight. A devaluation may become necessary. If so,
it will need to be handled adroitly to minimize the damage done to
the government's credibility and to persuade Brazilians that the
move will improve economic prospects, not trigger a return to
hyperinflation.

IN NEW TACTIC, D'AMATO AD POINTS TO 1980 PROBE OF SCHUMER 
</HEADLINE>
  (DUPLICATION NOTICE: Also sent in category `p') 
(bl) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With five days left before New York's U.S. Senate election, Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato steered his campaign in a new direction Thursday,
releasing a television advertisement that invokes a 1980
investigation of Rep. Charles Schumer in an effort to portray the
Democratic challenger as dishonest.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement began running heavily in markets across the
state Thursday night and previewed what D'Amato's aides said would
be a central part of their campaign-ending strategy: an attack on
Schumer's integrity, based on a 1980 investigation into whether he
illegally used state workers on his first congressional campaign.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's change in strategy follows a month in which his entire
focus has been on portraying Schumer as an absentee legislator who
missed votes in Washington to campaign for higher office.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury spent more than a year investigating
allegations that Schumer, as a member of the state Assembly, used
state employees on his congressional campaign. The U.S. attorney in
Brooklyn recommended that Schumer be indicted, but the Justice
Department in Washington rejected the recommendation, saying it
lacked jurisdiction. New York state prosecutors also declined to
press the case, and Schumer was never charged with any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's advisers said the senator would continue to attack
Schumer's attendance record, notwithstanding D'Amato's
acknowledgment earlier this week that he, too, missed hundreds of
vntes, in his case when he was a Nassau County official running for
the Senate in 1980. D'Amato reiterated those attacks while
campaigning Thursday, but his aides said the main thrust of the
television advertisements over the next 24 hours _ which are
directed at the remaining undecided voters in the race _ would be
the 1980 investigation of Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of a new theme so late into the campaign is
unusual, and came as some of D'Amato's strongest Republican
supporters expressed concern about the state of the senator's
campaign as he headed into the final weekend of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It is, many Democrats and Republicans agreed, a potentially
risky strategy, because in raising an 18-year-old investigation
into Schumer's ethics, D'Amato could invite attention to
investigations of his own public life, which until now have not
been a major topic in this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Ethics Committee investigated D'Amato for supposedly
providing favors to campaign contributors, but found no credible
evidence of wrongdoing. But the committee faulted him in 1991 for
allowing his brother Armand to use his office on behalf of a law
client.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato introduced this new issue after 10 difficult days for
his campaign, during which the focus of attention has turned from
Schumer's attendance record and to D'Amato's record and behavior.
It began when D'Amato used a Yiddish vulgarism to describe Schumer
last week and then denied making the remark until his own
supporters confirmed it. A number of public and private polls have
suggested that Schumer picked up support during this period.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer moved Thursday to exploit D'Amato's latest problem, the
release of records that showed that, as a member of the Nassau
County Board of Supervisors, he missed hundreds of votes to
campaign for the Senate. What might normally have been a minor
moment in D'Amato's political evolution became a potential problem
because D'Amato has based his own campaign on belittling Schumer
for skipping votes to run for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In numerous film clips from debates and news conferences,
D'Amato is seen lecturing Schumer on the importance of putting the
obligations of government ahead of one's own political career.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's advisers picked one and turned it into an
advertisement that went on the air Thursday night. In it, D'Amato,
portrayed in the gray and grainy images that have become the
hallmark of both men's television campaign, proclaims that ``the
people expect us to be there, fighting, making a difference
voting.'' As he speaks, the screen shows newspaper headlines about
his acknowledgment, and examples of missed votes.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato on Wednesday had indicated that he was going to raise
the issue of the 1980 investigation against Schumer, when he read a
brief statement to reporters as he sought to turn attention away
from questions about his own attendance record. The senator never
mentioned the topic in his public speeches as he campaigned across
New York state Thursday with Gov. George Pataki _ his aides said
they would let the television advertisements carry the weight of
these attacks _ but he told reporters aboard his campaign plane
that he considered the attacks appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't me who brought up the question of 18 years ago,''
D'Amato said during a flight from Syracuse to Rome, N.Y. ``Mr.
Schumer brought up the issue of 18 years ago. So let him explain
it.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's latest advertisement looks almost identical to the one
released Thursday by Schumer, aside from some obvious differences.
The senator builds his advertisement around a clip of Schumer from
a debate. ``The issue to New Yorkers is trust,'' Schumer says as
the screen shows clippings recounting the investigation. The
advertisement does not note that Schumer was never prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato said Thursday that the introduction of this new
advertisement did not mean that he was abandoning the attack on
Schumer's attendance record. ``Look, he'd like to have it over,''
D'Amato said. ``He'd like to attempt to say, to make an excuse for
missing more votes in the Congress of the United States than any
other congressman from New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, this change in course comes at a time when no
public polls have shown any evidence that this attack is working.
And the senator's advisers hammered away Thursday at the issue of
the 1980 investigation with the same intensity with which they had
discussed the issue of Schumer's missed votes just a few days ago.

FILM WATCHING MAKES LINEBACKER TOUGH CRITIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's hit the pause button on Eric Fields' fast-moving career to
get a sense of why the linebacker is one of Arizona State's few
pleasant surprises this season.
</P>
<P>
   There he is, in the film room, watching tape again.
</P>
<P>
   ``He watches an hour to two hours of tape every day,'' ASU
defensive coordinator Phil Snow said. ``The two previous years, we
had a lot of guys that did that. But this year's team is young, and
they don't appreciate that. They think they can get by on talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric understands. For a young guy, that's atypical.''
</P>
<P>
   It also explains why the redshirt freshman has emerged as one of
the top defensive players for Arizona State (3-4, 2-2 Pac-10)
heading in Saturday's game at Washington State (3-4, 0-4). Although
he has started only four games, he has 26 tackles and is second on
the team in tackles for losses with nine.
</P>
<P>
   He led ASU in both categories (11 and three) in an eye-opening
effort against Notre Dame on Oct. 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitting somebody gives you the same charge as a tailback
breaking 98 yards or a cornerback getting an interception,'' he
said. ``I love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fields' ascent has been fueled by a combination of hard work and
ASU misfortune.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils grew increasingly thin at linebacker, beginning
with returning starter Larry Johnson's academic ineligibility. Then
came a string of injuries to Stephen Trejo.
</P>
<P>
   Fields saw an opportunity and capitalized.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me a little while to get the feel of college
football,'' he said. ``It's a lot faster than high school. The more
I play, the more comfortable I feel. With game experience, you're
not so much on the back of your heels.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first game against Brigham Young, he was pursuing the
quarterback when he found himself blindsided by a defender.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got smacked across the chin,'' he said. ``When I got home,
my mom called and said, `You can't let them do that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   While Fields is learning under fire, the Sun Devils believes
he's worth the risk. They like his size (6 feet 3, 225 pounds) and
speed. Most of all, they like his potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes mistakes, but he learns from them and he plays hard
and he'll tackle,'' Snow said. ``I think he's going to end up being
very good here.''
</P>
<P>
   So do the many Pac-10 schools that tried to recruit him out of
Western High School in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   He started his prep career as a cornerback, in part because he
was only 5-6 and 125 pounds as a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to linebacker as a junior and still holds Western's
record for most tackles in a game with 18 (13 solo efforts).
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived at ASU, he initially resisted the idea of
redshirting. Then he caught wind of the Sun Devils' sophisticated
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had two coverages in high school: zone and man-to-man,''
Fields said.
</P>
<P>
   Coverages aren't the only thing he has had to learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never lost four games in my life,'' he said. ``It's a
slap in the face. It tells us that every time we go out there, it's
a battle. Nothing is guaranteed. We have to start focusing on
``us,'' and ``us'' playing hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to take what's happened to us (in the past) and just
let it go.''
</P>
<P>
   Fields dismissed suggestions that some Sun Devils have written
off the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we have anybody on this team who wants to just
lay down,'' he said. ``We don't have that kind of mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, such an idea appalls Fields. He lives for football. He
calls the off-season the worst time of the year.
</P>
<P>
   He's equal parts social butterfly and escapist. He likes hanging
with his teammates, but he is teased by the coaching staff for
spending much of his free time wearing headphones.
</P>
<P>
   When he's not around his friends, he can be found near a
computer. (``You can turn them off whenever you want to,'' he said,
smiling.) If a career in the NFL doesn't happen, he intends to have
his degree in computer information systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``What keeps me playing so hard is I can never see myself not
playing football,'' he said. ``I wouldn't know what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Watch a lot of videotape, probably. &QL;

IN NEW TACTIC, D'AMATO AD POINTS TO 1980 PROBE OF SCHUMER 
</HEADLINE>
  (DUPLICATION NOTICE: Also sent in category `a') 
(bl) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With five days left before New York's U.S. Senate election, Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato steered his campaign in a new direction Thursday,
releasing a television advertisement that invokes a 1980
investigation of Rep. Charles Schumer in an effort to portray the
Democratic challenger as dishonest.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement began running heavily in markets across the
state Thursday night and previewed what D'Amato's aides said would
be a central part of their campaign-ending strategy: an attack on
Schumer's integrity, based on a 1980 investigation into whether he
illegally used state workers on his first congressional campaign.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's change in strategy follows a month in which his entire
focus has been on portraying Schumer as an absentee legislator who
missed votes in Washington to campaign for higher office.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury spent more than a year investigating
allegations that Schumer, as a member of the state Assembly, used
state employees on his congressional campaign. The U.S. attorney in
Brooklyn recommended that Schumer be indicted, but the Justice
Department in Washington rejected the recommendation, saying it
lacked jurisdiction. New York state prosecutors also declined to
press the case, and Schumer was never charged with any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's advisers said the senator would continue to attack
Schumer's attendance record, notwithstanding D'Amato's
acknowledgment earlier this week that he, too, missed hundreds of
votes, in his case when he was a Nassau County official running for
the Senate in 1980. D'Amato reiterated those attacks while
campaigning Thursday, but his aides said the main thrust of the

 S&AMP;P Co. About to Buy Stroh Brewery  &HT;       
 By Carolyn Said 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
S&AMP;P Co. of Mill Valley, a brewery and real estate firm that manages
the estate of a reclusive millionaire called ``the Howard Hughes of
the beer world,'' is about to purchase Stroh Brewery Co. of
Detroit, according to sources close to S&AMP;P.
<P>
   Combining S&AMP;P's Pabst Brewing Co. with Stroh would shake up the
$36 billion U.S. beer industry, currently suffering from pricing
wars and stagnant sales. Stroh is the nation's fourth-largest
brewing company, and S&AMP;P ranks No. 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to some brewery executives, there is excess capacity
in the system: Too many brands chasing not quite enough
consumers,'' said David L. Ross, managing editor of Market Watch, a
New York magazine that tracks beer, wine and spirits retailing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Pabst takes over Stroh, it is more than likely that some
(Stroh) breweries might be closed and some brands might be
discontinued,'' Ross said. ``Pabst is known for its aggressive,
cost-cutting policies to wring maximum profits from declining
brands. In the past, that has translated into closing breweries,
laying off workers and slashing advertising and promotional
budgets.''
</P>
<P>
   S&AMP;P is embroiled in litigation with relatives of its deceased
owners, Paul and Lydia Kalmanovitz of Tiburon.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Kalmanovitz, who emigrated from Poland to the United States
as a young man in the 1920s, was known for his tight-fisted
business acumen, his devotion to charitable causes including Guide
Dogs for the Blind in San Rafael, and his occasional bursts of
extravagance.
</P>
<P>
   He once offered to donate $15 million to San Francisco to build
a West Coast counterpart to the Statue of Liberty on Alcatraz.
</P>
<P>
   Just a year before his death in 1987, Kalmanovitz racked up an
$800,000 tab on an automobile shopping spree, picking up a
Rolls-Royce Silver Spur for his wife and Bentleys for himself, his
chief of staff, his lawyer, doctor and an aide.
</P>
<P>
   The Kalmanovitzes _ who are entombed in a $6.5 million mausoleum
in Colma, along with two German shepherds and a cat _ left their
estate, estimated at $600 million to $1.2 billion, to benefit
unspecified colleges, universities and hospitals. Relatives of the
childless couple promptly slapped S&AMP;P with lawsuits, claiming the
money for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   S&AMP;P's biggest brand is Pabst, which makes Olde English 800, the
best-selling malt liquor in the United States. If S&AMP;P were to
acquire Stroh, it possibly would sell off Stroh's malt-liquor
brands _ Colt 45, Schlitz Malt Liquor and Mickey's _ to avoid
antitrust concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Miller Brewing Co., the No. 2 U.S. brewery, is a likely suitor
for those brands because it is weak in the malt-liquor segment,
according to Ross.
</P>
<P>
   Established in 1850, Stroh is the largest family owned and
operated brewery in the United States. Its brands include Lone
Star, Old Milwaukee, Rainier and Henry Weinhard's. Stroh's revenues
in 1997 were estimated at $1.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   All U.S. beermakers have felt the impact of a brutally
competitive market over the past two years, but Stroh and Pabst
appear to have been particularly hard hit. Impact Databank, a New
York research firm, said Stroh's sales fell 9.8 percent in 1997,
while Pabst's sales declined by 13.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Stroh issued a statement denying it had agreed to sell the
company but said it has explored ``strategic alternatives'' in the
past year that include joint ventures, the purchase or sale of
certain assets and partnering with other brewers. The company said
it remains profitable.
</P>
<P>
   S&AMP;P Chairman William Bitting and Chief Financial Officer Bernard
Orsi did not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   The privately held company employs 1,600 and had $550 million
sales in fiscal year 1997, according to Hoover's company profiles.
Its beer brands also include Olympia, Pearl, Falstaff and Hamm's.
Among its real estate investments are the Costco site at 11th and
Harrison in San Francisco, a 240-home housing project at Hunters
Point and various shopping malls in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Company founder Kalmanovitz started his career as a chauffeur
for movie tycoon Louis B. Mayer, but he soon started building an
empire of bars and nightclubs, with forays into real estate. He got
into the brewery business in 1958 when he bought Maier Brewing Co.
of Los Angeles. He quickly gobbled up a string of failing
beermakers, consolidating operations at S&AMP;P plants in Milwaukee;
San Antonio, Texas; and Tumwater, Wash. His biggest acquisition was
the hostile takeover of Pabst for $63 million in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Mr. Paul' was a very difficult taskmaster, brilliant in the
brewing industry. He had the uncanny ability to always be ahead of
the market and was a great strategist when it came to putting deals
together,'' said Yeoryios C. Apallas, a California deputy attorney
general. Apallas, who works in the charitable trust and foundation
division, represents the nonprofit beneficiaries in Kalmanovitz's
will.
</P>
<P>
   The huge bequest to charity ``was his way of repaying America's
hospitality,'' Apallas said.
</P>
<P>
   If the courts uphold the Kalmanovitz will, eventually there will
be another shakeup in the beer industry. Under U.S. tax law, the
Kalmanovitz charitable foundation will have to sell off most of S&AMP;P
within five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were Anheuser-Busch, Miller Brewing or Coors Brewing (the top
three beer companies) to acquire S&AMP;P, it could raise antitrust
concerns with the U.S. government,'' Ross said. ``It is quite
possible in five years that an overseas brewery might acquire
either the (S&AMP;P) brands or the breweries themselves to achieve a
foothold in the large U.S. market.''

 Wells to Offer Stock Options To Employees  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. will offer stock options to all of its more than
90,000 employees after it merges with Minneapolis' Norwest Corp.
next week, people familiar with the plan said.
<P>
   The options program is scheduled to be announced Monday, the
date the combination of the two banks takes effect, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
   Part-time and full-time employees of the combined bank will get
options to buy up to 200 shares at the price at which the stock
trades on the day the merger is completed. The options will be
exercisable for five years.
</P>
<P>
   A Wells Fargo spokesman couldn't be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Options give holders the right to buy stock at a preset price.
Their value increases if a company's stock price rises.
</P>
<P>
   Awarding employees options is a way of giving them a stake in
the business. Such programs are common in growing industries, such
as computers.
</P>
<P>
   But it's unusual in the banking industry for employees other
than executives or big revenue producers, such as traders, to get
stock options.
</P>
<P>
   BankAmerica Corp. launched a similar program two years ago.
Under the bank's Take Ownership plan, employees received options
every six months entitling them to buy 50 to 90 shares.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo and Norwest agreed in June to merge, forming the
seventh-largest U.S. bank.
</P>
<P>
   The new institution will keep the Wells Fargo name and have
headquarters in San Francisco.

 How Robby Stephens' Fund Group May End Up in BankBoston Family  &HT;       
 By Mark Veverka 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Could Robertson Stephens Investment Management get gobbled up by
BankBoston? Don't laugh. It could happen.
<P>
   The clock is ticking to sell the fund group, which currently is
a unit of the new Bank of America. The Charlotte, N.C., banking
behemoth wants to discard the fund group that it inherited from the
old Bank of America, and it needs to sell the money management unit
before the end of the year because its key personnel will become
free agents by then, says a source close to the situation. It turns
out that various ``contractual constraints will go away in a matter
of months,'' the source says.
</P>
<P>
   After all, how much can Hugh McColl fetch in exchange for a
money-management firm without many portfolio managers remaining?
</P>
<P>
   Enter BankBoston, the same bank holding company that bought the
fund group's sister, the investment bank and brokerage side of the
San Francisco financial firm, now called BancBoston Robertson
Stephens.
</P>
<P>
   It could be that BancBoston is interested in acquiring Robertson
Stephens Investment Management. A spokeswomen for the fund group
would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   Why now? Why didn't BankBoston grab both halves of Robertson
Stephens _ the whole ball of wax _ in the first place?
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, at the time that BankBoston agreed to buy the
investment bank, the old BofA was asking too much for the fund
group.
</P>
<P>
   There also was a desire on behalf of BankBoston not to take the
founding principals of the two respective operations: Sandy
Robertson, the dealmaker, and Paul Stephens, the money manager.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been difficult to take one principal without the
other. However, regardless of Paul Stephens' recent stock-picking
slump, the fund group would lose much of its cachet without its
venerable cleanup hitter in the lineup. And now with Robertson not
having joined BancBoston Robertson Stephens, it would be easier for
the Boston concern to swallow the fund group with Stephens included
in a buyout. Got that?
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the new BofA is running out of other options. A
leveraged buyout by the principals of the fund group is highly
unlikely, the source says. It would be simpler _ and less fraught
with friction _ for Robby's top money managers to go off on their
own as opposed to co-signing notes and collectively buying back the
firm, the source says.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, other suitors have fallen by the wayside. Nuveen of
Chicago, which was in ``serious discussions'' with BofA, has
dropped its interest in Robertson Stephens Management, the source
says.
</P>
<P>
   The new BofA ``probably will sell to someone friendly and just
clear the decks,'' the source says.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves BankBoston. Who could be more friendly to the
castaway fund group? Heck, they're practically stepfamily.
BankBoston probably knows more about Robertson Stephens Investment
Management than any other possible suitor. Warts and all. We'll
see.
</P>
<P>
   DO-GOODISM: Employees want choices when it comes to their 401(k)
plans. Yet in addition to having a broad menu of funds that earn
solid returns, people increasingly are asking for opportunities to
invest their hard-earned money in socially responsible funds _
portfolios that screen out companies that are deemed to be
undesirable corporate citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Graphics is blazing this trail. As of the first of the
year, Citizen's Index Fund of Portsmouth, N.H., says it will be one
of 12 funds offered by the Mountain View technology firm.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the first socially responsible fund offered by Silicon
Graphics. Citizens (which was founded in San Francisco in the 1980s
and formerly was called Working Assets Common Holdings) is
supplanting the Calvert Socially Managed Fund of Bethesda, Md., in
the company's 401(k) lineup, both Citizens and Silicon Graphics
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, small investors want a greater say about the
character of the companies in which their funds invest. Or perhaps,
it simply pays to be politically correct. At the end of September,
the average annual return of Citizens' institutional index fund
since its inception in January 1996 has been 27.3 percent. Not too
shabby.

 Robertson Stephens Plans Blanket Cuts in Staffing  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
BancBoston Robertson Stephens said yesterday that it is planning
staff cuts throughout the organization amid a slowdown in its
investment banking business.
<P>
   People close to the investment banking firm said they understood
that about 5 percent of the firm's approximately 900 employees
could lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael McCaffery, chief executive for Robertson Stephens,
said the precise number hasn't yet been set.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've not made any final decisions'' about how many people
will be fired, he said. ``We are in the process of making sure our
cost structure is in line with the current business environment and
what we expect the environment to be'' in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Robertson Stephens' employees are in San Francisco,
where the firm is based.
</P>
<P>
   Managers have been asked to prepare cutback plans for their
business units and virtually all departments are likely to be hit,
people close to the firm said.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson Stephens' job cuts are coming during a deep slump in
investment banking, especially in the firm's main business of
taking technology and other fast-growing companies public.
</P>
<P>
   Other investment banks and brokerage firms have disclosed
similar plans to slash jobs. Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., the largest U.S.
brokerage, said two weeks ago it would cut some 3,400 jobs, or
about 5 percent of its worldwide workforce.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's Hambrecht &AMP; Quist Group, one of Robertson
Stephen's main rivals, announced a plan earlier this month to
freeze new hiring and eliminate jobs by attrition.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston Corp. bought Robertson Stephens in May from
BankAmerica Corp. for $400 million cash, plus $400 million in
payments spread out over four years to Robertson Stephens' partners
and key employees.

 Sun Micro, Oracle Pledge Global Database of Schools   By David Einstein 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Lamenting the prospect of ``digital apartheid,'' officials from Sun
Microsystems and Oracle pledged yesterday to create a global
database of schools as a first step to getting students around the
world online.
<P>
   The plan, announced at the State of the World Forum in San
Francisco, will be modeled after a database that has helped the
grassroots organization NetDay identify U.S. schools that lack
Internet access and spawn volunteer efforts to wire them.
</P>
<P>
   Sun scientist John Gage, who founded NetDay, announced the
global database project during a panel on the economic and social
disadvantages faced by people who lack access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The tone of the panel was set by moderator Marc Benioff, a
senior vice president of Oracle. ``The harsh reality for the 21st
century is that if you don't have access to PCs and the Internet,
you won't participate in communication, education, entertainment
and commerce,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Benioff and Gage hatched the idea prior to the panel, each one
agreeing to contribute resources from his company. Sun will provide
powerful computers, Oracle the database software, and both
companies will contribute staff time.
</P>
<P>
   Gage, a member of yesterday's panel, said the world database
would be modeled after one he created for NetDay that features an
interactive map showing all U.S. schools, color-coded to indicate
whether they're wired. In addition, each school has its own Web
page with information including how many classrooms have Internet
access.
</P>
<P>
   Gage said he hopes the world database _ like the U.S. model _
will be a catalyst, drawing attention from local businesses,
nonprofit organizations and grassroots groups that can pitch in to
get schools wired. He also said the project should encourage
schools to seek help.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we put up a Web page for every school in the U.S., we
discovered that as soon as you do that, schools that nobody knows
about suddenly announce themselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The big challenge, said Gage, is compiling information about the
schools, many of which are in remote locations and are poorly
served by local and regional governments.
</P>
<P>
   To get the data, Oracle and Sun will turn to government
agencies, but also will appeal to school newspapers, asking student
reporters to submit information about their schools via the World
Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Obtaining information about schools is crucial, said Benioff.
``We have to be able to measure who's online and who's not. If we
can know what kind of computers, teacher training and curriculum
schools have, that's a first step to building a quality educational
network worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   Sun and Oracle are leaders among large corporations that
contribute toward connecting schools to the Internet. Yesterday
afternoon, Oracle wired its latest school, the George Moscone
Elementary School in San Francisco, putting 50 computers in 10
classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Gage said that in compiling the global school database, Oracle
and Sun will work with two other organizations focused on Internet
learning _ Schools Online, the brainchild of Silicon Valley
entrepreneur Kamran Elahian; and Thinkquest, an annual contest that
awards scholarships to students who come up with new ways to use
the Net.

GLENN NOT ALONE AS A MARVEL

<P>
   The shuttle Discovery lifted off its launch pad and soared
toward the heavens Thursday, with a 77-year-old aboard.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know John Glenn. But in sports, I've met people his age,
and older, who possess a luminous spirit and a zest for life.
</P>
<P>
   Each of them, in his or her own way, is an inspiration. A hero. &QL; 
__ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Mark Langston tossed the ball to Gary Gaetti. Gaetti threw it
back to Langston. Back and forth, to and fro.
</P>
<P>
   It was an ordinary game of catch, but that day, the spring
training rite made me smile. Every time Langston caught the ball,
he reached out and tagged the shoulder of coach Jimmie Reese, like
an infielder holding a theft-minded runner on base. Reese, dressed
in an Angels uniform, was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Three years before he died, the old man was warming his bones in
the sunshine with ``my boys'' in his 72nd year in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Reese broke into the minors in 1924. As a Yankee, he roomed with
Babe Ruth. Asked about his career, Reese sat me down and graciously
shared his favorite stories. He recounted train rides and card
games and colorful anecdotes. He quoted Lou Gehrig and Ruth. His
pale blue eyes were bright, alive.
</P>
<P>
   It was just a simple game of catch. But I'll always remember
Langston lovingly touching Reese with his glove. The old man, he
knew, wasn't going to steal a base. There was no larceny in his
heart. Just the lifelong love for a game that kept him forever
young. &QL; 
__ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Sis here?'' a voice called out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Sis.''
</P>
<P>
   The check-in volunteer glanced up from his clipboard and nodded
at a small, spry woman wearing bifocals and a contestant's number
pinned to her chest. Sis Warnke is a 78-year-old grandmother.
``Seventy-nine in April,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sis had driven from Las Cruces, N.M. to run 1,500 meters at the
Arizona Senior Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   She did, too. When the pistol fired, the retired teacher who
raised four children and didn't began exercising until she reached
her 60s hurried away from the start line with a liveliness in her
step, as if life's next great adventure awaited her around the
first turn.
</P>
<P>
   Satchel Paige said it. Age is mind over matter. If you don't
mind, it don't matter. &QL; 
__ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Elwood Ware was moving a bit stiffly. A year earlier, the farmer
had fallen out of a pecan tree, breaking a leg and cracking five
ribs.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Ware spent three weeks in the hospital. He lost 35 pounds.
``Shrunk up on the vine,'' he said, as if describing his cantaloupe
crop hit by drought. He was on crutches for months.
</P>
<P>
   But neither his age nor a hitch in his get-a-long deterred him.
When his name was called, the septuagenarian in the straw hat
picked up a discus in his callused hand and slung it as far as he
could.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't matter if I won. Thing is, I tried it,'' Mr. Ware
said, showing me his silver medal. &QL; 
__ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego Grays took the field with a smile. They were the
age of those seniors in the movie ``Cocoon'' who discover the
youth-restoring water of a magical swimming pool, only it wasn't a
pool that rejuvenated them and made them feel like boys again.
</P>
<P>
   The Grays were in the championship game of the Senior Softball
World Series. They lost, but it wasn't sadness they shared.
Gathered around the large runner-up trophy, the players spoke of
the rewards.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is living,'' one player said. ``If it wasn't for this
team, maybe half these guys wouldn't still be around.'' They talked
about the joy of giving their best. They talked about next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smile, kids,'' the middle-aged daughter of one player called
out. The face framed in her camera lens was old and wrinkled.
Sometimes, when she looks at him, she wonders where the years have
gone. But in that instant, it wasn't a 70-year-old she saw. It was
the beaming smile of a young man. The one she remembered as a girl.
She clicked the shutter and laughed, and wiped away a tear. &QL;

NEW POLL RESULTS SHED NEW LIGHT ON RACES  
 AIMING THE BIG GUNS AT DRUG INITIATIVES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Alaska, Ariz., Calif., Ga., Ill., Mass. Nev., Ore.,
Wash.)  (lb)

<TEXT>
<P>
   With only four days to go until Election Day, pollsters are
everywhere, taking the United States' political pulse one last
time. Here are the latest readings on six of the most important
fall races, three for the Senate and three for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Senate:
</P>
<P>
   In California, Sen. Barbara Boxer, the Democratic incumbent, has
pulled ahead of state Treasurer Matt Fong, the Republican
challenger, by 51 percent to 42 percent after months of being on
the defensive, according to a Field Poll.
</P>
<P>
   Conducted Oct. 22 through 27 after the senator loosed a
$300,000-a-day barrage of negative television advertising, the
survey covered 678 likely voters and has a margin of error of plus
or minus four percentage points. A month ago, Fong led 48 percent
to 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Illinois, state Sen. Peter Fitzgerald, the Republican
challenger, still leads the Democratic incumbent, Sen. Carol
Moseley-Braun, according to a Mason-Dixon Poll. But with the help
of outside money and campaigners, Moseley-Braun has gained four
points since the last poll about two weeks ago, and Fitzgerald now
leads by only eight points, 49 percent to 41 percent. The poll was
conducted Oct. 24 through 26, covered 813 likely voters and has a
margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington state, Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat, still leads
the Republican challenger, Rep. Linda Smith, according to a
Mason-Dixon Poll. But with the help of a badly needed, if belated,
cash infusion from her party, Ms. Smith has gained five points
since the last poll early this month and Sen. Murray now leads by
only eight points, 49 percent to 41 percent. The poll was conducted
Oct. 26 and 27, covered 801 likely voters and has a margin of error
of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Governorships:
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, according to a new Mason-Dixon Poll, Lt. Gov. Don
Siegleman, the Democratic challenger, still leads Gov. Fob James,
the Republican incumbent, in a contest that has left both
candidates black and blue and has seen no significant gain or loss
by either over the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The poll has Siegleman ahead 49 percent to 43 percent, compared
with a lead of 48 percent to 43 percent in a Mason-Dixon Poll taken
about two weeks ago. The new poll was taken Oct. 24 through 26,
covered 808 likely voters and has a margin of error of plus or
minus 3.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, where the testy issue of race has recently become an
element in the governor's contest, Guy Millner, the unsuccessful
Republican candidate for governor four years ago, still leads state
Rep. Roy Barnes, this year's Democratic candidate, according to a
University of Georgia poll.
</P>
<P>
   But the figures for this poll _ 39 percent for Millner and 32
percent for Barnes, with 27 percent undecided _ are considerably
different from a poll taken less than two weeks earlier by
Mason-Dixon. It had Miller leading by only three percentage points
and only 11 percent of voters still undecided. The new poll was
conducted on Oct. 11 through 18, covered 500 likely voters and has
a margin of error of plus or minus 4.3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, where a raucous debate and a lot of campaign
dollars are keeping things hot in the governor's race, two new
polls by The Boston Herald and The Boston Globe show Acting Gov.
Paul Cellucci, the Republican incumbent, still with a significant
lead over his Democratic challenger, Attorney General Scott
Harshbarger. But not a clear enough lead to count Harshbarger out,
not yet.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Herald poll has Cellucci leading Harshbarger by 47
percent to 38 percent, with 15 percent undecided, while the Globe
poll has Cellucci ahead 46 percent to 41 percent, with 9 percent
undecided. Both polls were conducted Oct. 27 and 28, covered 400
likely voters and have a margin of error of plus or minus five
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Aiming the Big Guns at Drug Initiatives
</P>
<P>
   With polls indicating that ballot initiatives to legalize
marijuana for medical use might pass next Tuesday in some states,
Barry McCaffrey, the retired Army general who is White House
director of drug-control policy, figured it was time to throw more
troops into the fight.
</P>
<P>
   So he enlisted three former presidents _ George Bush, Jimmy
Carter and Gerald Ford _ and asked them to write a ``Dear Fellow
Citizen'' letter that would point out why the initiatives should be
defeated.
</P>
<P>
   The letter arrived on Wednesday and is being distributed to news
outlets and anti-marijuana forces in Alaska, Oregon and Washington,
where polls show most voters support the initiatives. It also has
been sent to Nevada and the District of Columbia, where passage is
more in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The thrust of the letter is that until government researchers
can determine whether marijuana is medically effective, it should
not be approved for medical use _ or, as one paragraph pointedly
puts it, for ``alleged medical purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These initiatives are not based on the best available
science,'' the letter argues. ``Compassionate medicine must be
based on science, not political appeals. Prejudging research
through a political process would be irresponsible and is not in
our national interest.''
</P>
<P>
   The three former presidents then encourage voters in Arizona to
pass a ballot initiative that would require the Food and Drug
Administration to approve medical use of marijuana before Arizona
doctors could prescribe it.
</P>
<P>
   In distributing the letter, McCaffrey said: ``These great former
elected national leaders, who we all respect so much, know that we
cannot use the ballot box to determine what is safe and effective
medicine. Nor should we send a terribly mixed message to our
children.''

ANALYSIS HAS ITS PERKS FOR VALLEY MAN  
 COMPUTER AIDS FOOTBALL JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GINTONIO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wanted: Assistant coach for a professional football team.
</P>
<P>
   Experience needed: None.
</P>
<P>
   Stan Kwan knew something about football, sure, but when he
landed a job with the San Diego Chargers fresh out of college at
21, he was thrown into a strange world. He got the job not because
he knew about pass routes or blitzes, red zones or zone coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Nope, he was Stan the computer man.
</P>
<P>
   Kwan, 28, a former two-sport star at Camelback High School as a
shortstop and quarterback, will be on the Detroit sideline Sunday
when the Lions host the Cardinals. He's an offensive and
special-teams assistant, but his major role for Coach Bobby Ross,
whom he followed from the Chargers to the Lions, is the ability to
break down game films.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like quality control,'' said Kwan, whose parents own a
Mexican restaurant in Phoenix and have a wall set aside for their
son's game balls and other honors.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Cardinals, I'll take their last four games, and figure
out we'll be able to base our game plan on that by charting
tendencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Kwan took an unlikely path to his current location. He played
baseball at San Diego State while majoring in criminal justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point, I considered the FBI as an option,'' he said.
``But I also knew that I wanted to do something in sports. So I
first chose a sport I thought I could be the best at.''
</P>
<P>
   Kwan got an introduction to Dan Henning, then coach of the
Chargers, in 1991. Henning told him the team already had someone
doing computer work. But a couple of days later, Henning telephoned
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me they were getting ready to fire the other guy, and
asked me, `Can you start tomorrow?' It was about 3:30 in the
afternoon, and he said I could take my time with the answer,'' Kwan
said. ``Then he said `I need your answer by 5.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been considering graduate school to try and earn a
sports administration degree, but I figured this was better. The
next day, I was a member of the staff.''
</P>
<P>
   He stayed when Ross replaced Henning, then followed Ross to
Detroit. During his time in San Diego and Detroit, he has become
more and more versed in the ins and outs of pro football, and his
duties have expanded. He said one person who has been instrumental
in helping him learn the game was Marc Trestman, the Cardinals
offensive coordinator, who spent a year in Detroit on Ross' staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not only a brilliant coach, he's very gifted on the
computer,'' Kwan said.
</P>
<P>
   When the Chargers started using computers in a big way, many
teams were surprised. But the concept was nothing new. The Dallas
Cowboys were on the cutting edge about two decades prior to that,
and their reliance on computers in making draft selections was the
subject of much debate and ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I`m very confident in the work I do,'' Kwan said. ``Coach Ross
likes it and pays a lot of attention to it. It makes it easier to
change plays, change the route on a certain play. More and more
coaches are starting to go that route with computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Mapping out strategy to help defeat the Cardinals, his hometown
team, will be like any other assignment _ almost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arizona is still very special to me,'' Kwan said. ``I always
try to keep up with things on the high school, college and
professional level. It would be more special for me if this game
were in Phoenix so I could come home and go to Sun Devil
Stadium.'' &QL;

EDITORIAL OBSERVER :  THE SECRET SPACE RACE BEHIND JOHN GLENN

<P>
   As John Glenn enjoys his second rendezvous with the cosmos, the
country is awash with nostalgia about the great space race with the
Soviet Union, one of the most memorable competitions of the Cold
War. If only the actual rivalry more closely resembled the myths
about it.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that by the time Glenn roared into orbit for the
first time, on Feb. 20, 1962, long after a Russian had circled the
earth, the United States was already winning a hidden and much
larger race with the Soviet Union over the military uses of space.
Though the public did not realize it then and has only a limited
conception now, the military competition cost more than the manned
space program, was far more important in influencing the course of
the Cold War and in many ways provided the technology used in the
Mercury and Apollo programs.
</P>
<P>
   The secret space race could not claim the shimmering goal of
sending a man to the moon. It lacked the life-and-death
consequences of every manned flight, and sported no human face to
make it accessible and inspirational to citizens. But even more
than the effort to reach the moon, it involved a mobilization of
scientific, industrial and military resources that has not been
attempted since.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose from the outset in the early 1950s was to match
Soviet advances in the development of ballistic missiles and to
produce technology to gather information about Soviet military
forces, especially nuclear weapons and the bombers and missiles
that carried them. The hope was to avoid another surprise attack
like Pearl Harbor and to keep ahead of Soviet armaments.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow successfully tested a hydrogen bomb in August 1953, less
than a year after the United States. The Soviet Union was soon
building a new fleet of long-range bombers and designing and
testing missiles that could deliver ever more compact and powerful
nuclear weapons to Western Europe and the United States. President
Eisenhower, believing that space might become a critical frontier
for spying and warfare, quietly approved a series of classified
projects that eventually revolutionized U.S. military technology
and provided much of the means for Glenn's flight.
</P>
<P>
   The primary objectives were to build missiles that could deliver
nuclear warheads to targets in the Soviet Union and to develop
planes and satellites to survey and photograph Soviet airfields and
missile bases first from high altitude and later from space. The
Soviet Union, of course, placed the first satellite into orbit in
October 1957. But Sputnik, though an enduring, humiliating symbol
of Russian superiority in space, was not a spy satellite. It was
secretly eclipsed in August 1960 by the first U.S.
photo-reconnaissance satellite. Moscow did not get a similar
satellite into operation until July 1962.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. satellite project, code-named Corona, was directed not
by the Pentagon but by the Central Intelligence Agency. It involved
both the placement in orbit of a sophisticated camera system and
the return to earth of the film in a special capsule designed to
withstand the searing heat produced during re-entry through the
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   This space achievement came eight months before Yuri Gagarin
became the first man in space, and 18 months before Glenn's
mission. Much of the technology developed for the Corona program
was adapted for manned flights.
</P>
<P>
   The public space race made for riveting scientific drama and
great individual and national accomplishment. But long before the
United States exceeded Soviet successes in manned flight, it had
pulled ahead in developing reliable missiles and sophisticated
military spacecraft. In some ways, the space race was over before
Glenn blasted off.

YOUNG DEFIES AGE; STEWART'S A BUST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eight weeks into the NFL season, and most fantasy owners are
thinking just one thing.
</P>
<P>
   Where are Mr. Peabody and the Way Back Machine?
</P>
<P>
   With them, we could travel back to the day of the fantasy draft
and correct those little oversights, like picking Pittsburgh
quarterback Kordell Stewart in the first round, or taking Oakland's
Jeff George ahead of San Francisco's Steve Young.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not going even going to mention Jake Plummer.
</P>
<P>
   Oops.
</P>
<P>
   Well, quit your grousing. At least some players have done well.
So let's hand out the midseason Mully Awards. &QL;  &QL; 
Quarterback &QL;  &QL; 
Most outstanding performance: Oh, to be Young again. He was
supposed to be old, injury prone and saddled with a dinged-up Jerry
Rice. Wrong, wrong and wrong. Young already has thrown for 20
touchdowns and more than 2,000 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest surprise: Vinny Testaverde, New York Jets. When the
season began, good ol' Vinny didn't even have the starting job.
He's thrown for 11 touchdowns against one interception.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest bust: Stewart, Pittsburgh. Apparently, even Stewart
knows he can't play. In the Monday nighter against Kansas City, he
told the coaches to keep running the ball in the second half,
according to running back Jerome Bettis. Stewart finished with 82
yards passing.
</P>
<P>
   Marmaduke Award (for biggest dog): Plummer, Arizona. The next
Joe Montana? Nah. Maybe the next Timm Rosenbach. &QL;  &QL; 
Running back &QL;  &QL; 
Most outstanding performance: Terrell Davis, Broncos. Davis entered
some elite company Sunday, joining Jim Brown and O.J. Simpson as
the only players to reach 1,000 yards in seven games. He is
virtually unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest surprise: Natrone Means, San Diego. After he bounced
around the league for a while, everyone figured the rotund one was
done. But he's playing well for a lousy San Diego team, ringing up
800 yards and five touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest bust: Ricky Watters, Seattle. Watters has just two
touchdowns so far and doesn't look to improve much on that,
especially playing for the pass-happy Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   Marmaduke Award: Marty Schottenheimer, Kansas City. Yeah, he's a
coach. He's also the reason none of his running backs will ever
crack 1,000 yards because of his idiotic substitution system. &QL;  &QL; 
Wide receiver &QL;  &QL; 
Most outstanding performance: Antonio Freeman, Green Bay. He was
the top receiver in the draft, and he's lived up to the hype, with
six touchdowns and 627 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest surprise: Rocket Ismail, Carolina. The aptly named one
has busted loose for four touchdowns and 512 yards, despite playing
for one of the worst teams.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest bust: Tim Brown, Oakland. Brown broke through with a
touchdown last week, but his statistics don't warrant a
second-round pick, where most owners probably took him. Maybe he'll
turn it around if George comes back.
</P>
<P>
   Marmaduke Award: Terry Glenn, New England. This guy is such a
big baby. He's never in the lineup because he's always nursing some
sort of minor injury. The Patriots are so desperate for a receiver,
they signed Henry Ellard, who may have actually played for the
Boston Patriots. &QL;  &QL; 
Tip of the week &QL;  &QL; 
Look for Detroit receiver Johnnie Morton to have a big day against
the Cardinals this week. Aeneas Williams will probably spend his
time worrying about Herman Moore, leaving Morton to roam. &QL;  &QL; 
Waiver wire &QL;  &QL; 
Take a look at Detroit's rookie quarterback, Charlie Batch. He's
not afraid to throw the ball down the field. If you're desperate
for a running back, grab Green Bay's Travis Jervey or Arizona's
Mario Bates, who should get more playing time until Adrian Murrell
recovers. And here's another vote of confidence for San Diego
receiver Mikhael Ricks, who caught a touchdown last week. &QL;  &QL; 
One-hit wonder
</P>
<P>
   This week it's quarterback Donald Hollas, Oakland. When he threw
two touchdown passes against Cincinnati Sunday, it was the first
time he found the end zone in six years. &QL;  &QL;

EDITORIAL: RE-ELECT GOV. ROWLAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Oct. 30:
</P>
<P>
   The similarities between the recent careers of Gov. John Rowland
of Connecticut and Gov. George Pataki of New York are striking.
Both men appear to have read the same playbook on how to succeed as
a Republican in a Northeastern Democratic state. Rowland, like
Pataki, started out as a tough budget-cutter who was indifferent to
education issues and overly harsh in his plans for welfare reform.
But during the last two years, with the help of a reviving economy,
Rowland has become a friend to the environment, a champion of the
public schools and a cheerleader for the central cities who says
his goal is to make the Republican Party more ``inclusive.'' On the
matter of campaign finance, Rowland has made a turnabout and signed
a strong law that will virtually ban unregulated ``soft'' money in
future Connecticut campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   This metamorphosis may, as his critics charge, be evidence of
Rowland's political opportunism. But that is why we have elections.
If the governor has begun to take an interest in schools,
acquisition of open space and reviving urban areas because he wants
to win voter approval, the system is working.
</P>
<P>
   Any concerns about the permanence of Rowland's transformation
seem secondary given that his opponent, Rep. Barbara Kennelly, has
conducted a terribly disappointing campaign. Her problems have gone
beyond a lack of affinity for sound bites. Mrs. Kennelly seems hard
pressed to describe her specific plans for making Connecticut
better. Although she has spent a lifetime as a Hartford politician,
she can offer no concrete ideas about the city's troubled school
system _ a topic Rowland speaks about with intelligence and
apparent enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   This dismal campaign should not obscure the good work Mrs.
Kennelly has done during her years in Congress. But she has not
earned the right to be governor. Our endorsement goes to Rowland.

EDITORIAL: RE-ELECT SENATOR DODD 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Oct. 30:
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's U.S. Senate race has been a one-sided affair. Sen.
Christopher Dodd's Republican opponent, former Rep. Gary Franks,
has campaigned hard but not always wisely. Franks has misquoted
Dodd and gone over the top with his rhetoric more than once. It is
hardly likely that many voters will agree with his contention that
Dodd set a bad example for children when he called President
Clinton an ``idiot.''
</P>
<P>
   But some of Franks' attacks have hit home. This has not been a
shining period in Dodd's career. He lost a bid to become Democratic
leader in the Senate and accepted a post as co-chairman of the
Democratic National Committee when the committee, under White House
direction, was raising millions from suspect foreign sources. Dodd
attended a number of the now-infamous White House coffees without
ever believing, he contends, that they were actually fund-raisers.
He apparently never questioned the propriety of such sleazy fund
raising, and his connection to it has tarnished his record.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Dodd is vastly preferable to his opponent on a policy
level. Franks sided with the most conservative elements in his
party on numerous occasions, opposing gun control and programs to
extend voter registration. He even opposed the Family Medical Leave
Act, which Dodd sponsored and fought to pass. The senator, in
contrast, has been a reliable supporter of civil rights, civil
liberties, the environment and, despite his poor performance at the
DNC, campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   In modern Washington, where the House majority leader boasts
that he has traveled outside the country only once and never
intends to go again, Dodd has a sophisticated worldview that is
increasingly rare. He has a lifelong interest in Latin America, and
has been an important voice on human rights issues in that region.
He is even better known as a champion of children's causes, and has
recently been a successful advocate for children's health programs.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd has some exceptional gifts as a legislator, but lately he
seems to have lacked focus. We endorse his re-election in the hope
that he will use his talents more productively over the next six
years.

ARE CATS 1-UP ON DUCKS?  
 UA BOASTS 2 QBS THAT MAKE BIG PLAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ Imagine the scouting reports on Arizona and Oregon.
Turn to the chapter on quarterbacking in each.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona report focuses on an ability to throw on the run,
great creativity, a willingness to scramble, smarts and
gamesmanship. It also mentions a Smith with two-sport (football and
baseball) athleticism.
</P>
<P>
   Now, pick up the Oregon report. The quarterback chapter could
have been written by the same guy. There's even a Smith and some
baseball thrown into the mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's a difference,'' Arizona's Ortege Jenkins said.
``There's two of us. There's one of him.''
</P>
<P>
   The one happens to be Akili Smith, whose singular brilliance
this season has turned him into a Pac-10 rival to UCLA's Heisman
Trophy contender, Cade McNown.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a stretch to say that Saturday's Arizona-Oregon game
will be decided by an old question:
</P>
<P>
   Are two heads better than one?
</P>
<P>
   But Arizona's Jenkins-Keith Smith combo vs. Oregon's Akili Smith
provides an intriguing element to what promises to be a dramatic
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Wildcats Coach Dick Tomey already is on record as saying
Oregon's Smith is the conference's best quarterback. Tomey will get
no argument from Jenkins on that one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would give him that,'' Jenkins said. ``From what he's done
in his first six to seven games, he deserves that credit from Coach
Tomey. Akili is a big, strong quarterback. He's working with his
offense real well. Right now, I think he's playing as well as any
quarterback can.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins then stopped for a second and smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any quarterback, besides maybe me and Keith put together,''
Jenkins said beneath expressive eyes that were full of the
playfulness and gamesmanship that in part personify this season's
entertaining Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   Their personality is not unlike the Ducks and their quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins somersaults into the end zone for a game-winning
touchdown at Washington. Akili Smith dashes 68 yards against
Southern California for a game-winning score. Keith Smith picks up
a bobbled snap and tosses a series-sustaining pass to Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``For myself, I don't go out and try to do the spectacular,''
Jenkins said. ``I just go out there and play, and if something
spectacular happens, then it happens. Akili Smith has been making
big plays every game. I think he's averaging three or four a
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins' admiration for Akili Smith is evident. The Oregon
quarterback has some advantage. At 6 feet 3, he is bigger than
either the 6-2 Jenkins or 5-11 Keith Smith. The Oregon senior also
has more quarterbacking experience than either Jenkins, a
sophomore, or Smith, a junior.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of the Oregon quarterback's experience, however, has
much in common with the Arizona duo.
</P>
<P>
   Akili got a taste of the rotating quarterback syndrome last
season, sharing the job with Jason Maas of Yuma before establishing
himself as the clear No. 1 this fall.
</P>
<P>
   And both Akili and Keith Smith spent time in baseball's minor
leagues, riding the buses, rooming with teammates in cheap motels.
</P>
<P>
   ``They grew up,'' Tomey said of the two Smiths, who are two of
five major college quarterbacks (Florida State's Chris Weinke,
Georgia's Quincy Carter and Colorado's Mike Moschetti) who spent
time in the minors. ``That baseball experience makes them more
mature than just any other college kid.''
</P>
<P>
   With Akili Smith, the minor league tour amounted to three years
as an outfielder in the Pittsburgh Pirates organization. After a
cumulative batting average of .176, this Smith went to Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   With Keith Smith, it was one summer as a shortstop for a Class A
team in the Detroit Tigers' organization. After returning a
$200,000 bonus to the Tigers, this Mr. Smith went to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad for the experience,'' Arizona's Smith said. ``I've
been in the real world. I know what it's like out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, here I was an 18-year old kid eating a hot dog after a
game when I saw players with their children. I thought to myself:
`Gosh, this guy has to play baseball to feed his kids.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me grow up real fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, the money was nice and all. But, whoop-de-doo, there are
other things in life. I have absolutely no regrets.''
</P>
<P>
   Real-life experience in the minors is a perspective that Tomey
believes has become a source of leadership and poise from a key
position for both Arizona and Oregon. Neither Smith is likely to
panic, the Arizona coach said. What's more, they're grateful for
another chance.
</P>
<P>
   There has been some grumbling in Tucson this week about a
potentially disappointing crowd at Arizona Stadium for a game
between two teams still in the hunt for a major bowl. Between
45,000 and 48,000 are expected at a stadium with a capacity of
about 59,900.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keith hears about 45 (thousand),'' Tomey said. ``But he'll
tell you about days when he played in front of 65. That's 65
people, period.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of thing can't be taught. It's valuable in a
quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Arizona side, it provides a level of experience that
Jenkins has yet to acquire.
</P>
<P>
   ``If me and Keith were one person, we'd be the best possible
quarterback,'' Jenkins said.
</P>
<P>
   In Akili Smith, he just might be looking at that person. &QL;

SIDES ARE SAID TO BE CLOSER IN NBA TALKS

<P>
   NEW YORK _ National Basketball Association owners and players
took a respite from negotiations Thursday after some narrowing of
their positions on revenue distribution in a late-night bargaining
session.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys from the NBA and the union spoke on the telephone
Thursday, but another round of bargaining was not likely to take
place until the weekend at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly 100 players and ownership representatives from all
29 teams scattering throughout the country after a marathon day in
New York on Wednesday, the momentum that created a sense of
optimism over the league's labor impasse might have left with them.
</P>
<P>
   But during an 8-and-a-half hour negotiation at a midtown law
firm that concluded at 1 a.m. Thursday, progress was made on the
key economic issue in a dispute that has brought the cancellation
of 194 games in November.
</P>
<P>
   According to officials on both sides, the players reduced their
requested share of total revenues from 63 to 60 percent, and the
owners, who have maintained that they want the players to make no
more than 48 percent of revenue by 2002, raised that number to 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The players last year earned 57.1 percent of all
basketball-related income, a figure that enabled the owners to
reopen the old collective-bargaining agreement and declare a
lockout this past summer.
</P>
<P>
   Total revenue share and a limitation on individual salaries are
the biggest stumbling blocks in the negotiations. The players have
moved off their luxury tax proposal that would place a 50 percent
tax on all salaries over $18 million, indicating they will lower
the annual salary figure. The owners, meanwhile, are still wedded
to absolute limits on upper-echelon salaries.
</P>
<P>
   The parties have also discussed arrangements for rookies. The
NBA and the union have said they would agree to a system that would
prevent young players from moving to another team until the fourth
year of their contracts. But the league is pushing for the right of
first refusal by the player's current team, a restricted form of
free agency.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides have also closed ground on limiting annual raises
of players. Those discussions involve both free agents who re-sign
with their teams under the so-called Larry Bird exception and
players who are looking for deals with new clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the parties are apart on variety of issues,''
Commissioner David Stern said. ``We have to see where the next
place might be to make some progress. There might be a framework,
but there are so many issues on the table _ and they are not
trivial. We're going to continue losing time.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the lockout might be resolved in the next week, Stern
shook his head and said: ``I just don't know. I just don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   After nearly 20 players, a group of owners and lawyers for both
sides met Wednesday, Stern and his deputy commissioner, Russ
Granik, negotiated between about midnight and 12:30 a.m. directly
with Michael Jordan, union president Patrick Ewing and union
executive director Billy Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing asked Jordan to attend the negotiation even though Jordan
is not on the union's executive committee. His presence in the
talks was welcomed by both sides. After drawing the ire of Abe
Pollin, the Washington Wizards' owner, during an afternoon
question-and-answer session, he verbally sparred with Stern until 1
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these guys aren't in a position to talk back to these
guys, but Jordan is,'' said a union official, speaking on condition
of anonymity. ``He is a tremendous deal-maker, someone who knows
how to negotiate. He understands leverage, strength and how to play
the game.''

DON'T TAKE OFFENSE  
 COORDINATOR GETS HEAT ABOUT PLUMMER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cardinals offensive coordinator Marc Trestman has heard the
whispers and the beating of the drums.
</P>
<P>
   He knows many are fingering him for the team's offensive
problems, saying second-year quarterback Jake Plummer has taken a
giant step backward in trying to run the West Coast offense that
Trestman brought to the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard on me, too,'' Trestman said. ``I'm personally
disappointed in the way we're playing.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers don't lie. Only the Philadelphia Eagles have a worse
offense than the Cardinals, who are averaging 251.4 yards per game.
Plummer is the second-lowest-rated passer among NFC starters,
throwing six touchdowns and 11 interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This offense is in the infantile stage,'' Trestman said. ``I'm
very disappointed in where we are, but I'm not discouraged about
where we're going. We came out of training camp thinking we were a
little better than we were.''
</P>
<P>
   In the preseason, Plummer completed his first 11 passes against
Seattle and all eight against Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   In the regular season, he has thrown seven interceptions and has
been sacked 11 times in the past three games, not exactly Joe
Montana-like numbers or worthy of Most Valuable Player
consideration, as predicted by former San Francisco 49ers Coach
Bill Walsh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we all know Jake is going to be a terrific
quarterback,'' Trestman said. ``Where is he now? I don't know. I do
know this: He can cross over at any time and play at a higher
level.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has probably made eight or nine mistakes that created the
perception he is not as far along as he should be or that he has
regressed. The fact is, there's a whole new responsibility on his
shoulders. But the ultimate accountability is on my shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   Trestman addressed many of the questions fans have had about the
offense and Plummer's performance.
</P>
<P>
   On why the Cardinals don't have Plummer roll out more, taking
advantage of his quickness and elusiveness: ``That's certainly part
of our offense,'' Trestman said. ``We've done that and done it
fairly well. But we can't rely on just one area to get you by.''
</P>
<P>
   On whether the complicated West Coast offense, which emphasizes
a short, controlled passing game, inhibits Plummer: ``In time, this
offense will let Jake maximize all of his skills. I know there's a
whirlwind around me, and everybody has a critique. But as the blur
of the critique goes on, we have to stay the course to try to get
Jake to be the complete quarterback we know he's going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   On why the Cardinals don't throw the ball downfield more: ``Our
No. 1 down-the-field guy is Rob (Moore),'' Trestman said. ``When he
has been healthy, we've called those plays. You saw it in the St.
Louis game. Even in the Dallas game, you saw us take a couple of
shots on the sidelines. But in the last couple of games, the
(opposing defensive backs) have rolled up to both sidelines and
taken those plays away.''
</P>
<P>
   On whether Plummer would be better served to take a few series
off and watch from the sidelines: ``I don't think Jake is the kind
of player to sit and watch. He needs to have game reps. He needs to
be out there. If he is not in there, we regress as a football team,
and we're trying to progress as an offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Trestman also is aware that the team's offensive line continues
to take heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody will ever hear me complain or critique personnel,'' he
said. ``My job is to coach the players. It's tough to judge
offensive lines early in their existence. It's still early for this
line. We've had some bad injury breaks. (Rookie) Anthony Clement is
out. Chris Dishman has been hurt. I still think this line can come
together. It might not, but it can.''
</P>
<P>
   Trestman describes his relationship with Plummer as evolving.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're able to talk to each other on a professional basis,'' he
said. ``We don't mince words when we have problems. It's a business
relationship. But I think in the downtime when we've been together,
our relationship is growing.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer said he still is getting to know Trestman. But he hasn't
lost any confidence that he will get his game and the offense on
track.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Trestman thinks the offense has had little rhythm and has
made far too many mistakes. Only the Chicago Bears have committed
more turnovers than the Cardinals, who have lost the ball 20 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are signs we are making progress, but we can't turn the
ball over and win,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Trestman's last boss, Detroit Lions Coach Bobby Ross, whose team
plays the Cardinals on Sunday, thinks Trestman will get results.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a great young coach,'' Ross said of his
quarterback coach from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   That's not what they are saying about Trestman on Valley talk
radio, which Trestman understands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year in Detroit, we had a very slow start as an
offense,'' Trestman said. ``We are in the early stages of this
offense becoming what we want it to become. I'm not going to beat
myself up.'' &QL;

RANGERS BEGIN THEIR QUEST FOR JOHNSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Rangers' attempts to strengthen their
rotation will begin with left-hander Randy Johnson, a legitimate
No. 1 starter and perhaps the game's most imposing figure.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Doug Melvin spoke Wednesday with Barry Meister,
who represents Johnson, and conveyed the Rangers' interest in the
American League's 1995 Cy Young Award recipient.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about parameters _ not money or anything like that _
and what he's looking for in regard to the type of club and things
like that,'' Melvin said of Johnson, who filed for free agency
Wednesday. ``We fit the criteria of some of the things he's looking
for, so we'll continue to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who earned $6 million last season, went 10-1 with a
1.28 earned-run average with Houston after the Astros' July 31
trade with the Seattle Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros have exclusive negotiating rights with Johnson
through Thursday, and are expected to offer the 35-year-old
left-hander a two-year contract worth $20 million early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson prefers pitching for an AL team, but Meister said his
client will not rule out a return to the Astros. Family
considerations also will play a significant factor in where Johnson
decides to play, Meister said. Johnson lives in Glendale, Ariz.,
and Arlington would be one of the AL cities closest to his home.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers and Astros will not be Johnson's only suitors. The
Cleveland Indians, Anaheim Angels, New York Yankees, Arizona
Diamondbacks and Colorado Rockies likely will express interest as
well.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, whose 1998 Opening Day payroll exceeded $54
million, already have 10 players signed for the upcoming season at
$39.5 million. However, owner Tom Hicks provides the organization
the resources necessary to sign Johnson. Hicks also owns the NHL's
Stars, and he demonstrated his financial commitment when that
franchise signed goalie Ed Belfour and winger Brett Hull as free
agents before the 1997 and '98 seasons, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, questions remain regarding Johnson's age and
durability, which stem from previous troubles with his lower back.
Johnson's best fastball during the Astros' National League Division
Series with the San Diego Padres registered 91 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference from what we're used to seeing was huge,''
Padres pitching coach Dave Stewart said. ``Throwing 90 is still
good, but it's not unusual. Heck, I've seen him throw 96, 97, 98. I
guess he was tired. It's been a long year for him, but he's also
getting up there in age. I don't know what he has left.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin declined to discuss whether the Rangers share those
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to leave it at saying we have interest and that I'm
going to visit with Barry Meister again somewhere down the line,''
Melvin said. Rangers to watch market The Rangers have exclusive
negotiating rights with right-hander Todd Stottlemyre through
Thursday, but it appears the organization will not tender the
free-agent pitcher a contract until the market determines his
worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever I offer, he's not going to accept unless I go way out
of line,'' Melvin said of Stottlemyre, who filed for free agency
last week. ``That's what I think happened with the Mike Piazza and
Al Leiter deals.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Mets this week awarded Piazza a seven-year contract
worth $91 million and Leiter a four-year contract worth $32 million
before the two potential free agents filed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just not prepared to do that at this point,'' Melvin said.
``He wants to test the market, and I'm not sure we're at the top of
his list.'' Vessel goes to Reds The Rangers sent minor-league
outfielder Andrew Vessel to the Cincinnati Reds to complete their
April 18 trade for outfielder Chad Mottola.
</P>
<P>
   Vessel, the Rangers' third-round selection during the 1993 June
amateur free-agent draft, once ranked among the organization's
brightest prospects. The Rangers placed Vessel on their 40-man
roster before the 1997 season, but the 23-year-old outfielder never
blossomed into the player the Rangers expected.
</P>
<P>
   Vessel, who played at Double-A Tulsa for the second consecutive
season in 1998, hit .238 with eight home runs and 49 runs batted in
in 106 games with the Drillers.

   Britain: Blair Aide Forced to Quit
</P>
<P>
   The government of Prime Minister Tony Blair has suffered its
first forced resignation since taking office 18 months ago. Ron
Davies is out as secretary for Wales after he was robbed Monday
night by strangers he invited into his car in an area known as a
meeting place for homosexuals and drug dealers. Blair has often
attacked the previous Conservative government for the number of its
members who left office in disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   Britain: New Vote Procedures Proposed
</P>
<P>
   A commission headed by the former finance minister, Lord
Jenkins, proposed new proportional voting procedures in elections
for the House of Commons that would give small parties greater
representation and make Continental-style coalition governments
more likely. Prime Minister Tony Blair has promised a referendum on
the current ``first-past-the-post'' electoral system, in which the
winner takes all, sometimes even without a majority of votes.

<P>
   Northern Ireland: a Missed Deadline
</P>
<P>
   The Irish foreign minister, David Andrews, and Britain's
Northern Ireland secretary, Mo Mowlam, said a pivotal deadline
would be missed in Northern Ireland because of a dispute over
disarming the Irish Republican Army. They said the issue would not
be resolved before the Saturday deadline for setting up a new
North-South ministerial council. The IRA says it will not disarm
until the entire peace accord is enacted. Protestants insist some
disarmament must begin soon.

JUDGE FREES WRONGLY CONVICTED MAN AFTER 8 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After eight years behind bars for a double-murder
conviction based entirely on what prosecutors now concede was
fabricated testimony, a Brooklyn man was exonerated and freed
Thursday by a judge who apologized to him for ``the entire judicial
system.'' The judge also expressed shock that he himself had been
``fooled'' by the witness.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Jeffrey Blake, 29, who earlier in the day had been
driven to state supreme court in Brooklyn from a maximum-security
prison upstate, where he had been serving a sentence of 36 years to
life, first lowered his head when Acting Justice Robert Kreindler
dismissed the case against him.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as the court session ended and Blake was ``now a free
man,'' as the judge put it, the liberated Blake hugged Michelle
Fox, the Legal Aid Society lawyer who had led the effort to
convince prosecutors that his conviction had been fully based on
perjury and should be thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   ``You did it, thank you,'' Blake said softly as he embraced Ms.
Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, as each new breath of free air seemed to fill
him with another dose of spirit, Blake rushed from the courthouse
through a pack of reporters and television cameras, saying: ``I
feel great! I'm going to live my life, man!''
</P>
<P>
   Blake's life had been interrupted by what Kreindler referred to
Thursday as a nightmare: his arrest in the June 1990 killings of
two men, Everton Denny and Kenneth Felix. Dozens of bullets fired
from an automatic weapon ripped into their car in East New York,
Brooklyn. Blake was charged after an acquaintance, Dana Garner,
told the police he had seen Blake shooting into the car.
</P>
<P>
   Garner was the sole witness implicating Blake, and in a 1991
trial at which Kreindler presided, the jury chose to believe Garner
rather than witnesses, including Blake's sister and his employer,
who testified that Blake had been miles from the scene of the
slayings.
</P>
<P>
   But Garner _ whom Ms. Fox described in court Thursday as a
chronic fabricator whose motives could only be guessed at _ came
forward and passed a polygraph test recently in which he recanted
his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Herbert, a columnist for The New York Times, wrote two
columns last summer describing problems with the case, and Ms. Fox
met with aides of District Attorney Charles J. Hynes of Brooklyn,
whose office had prosecuted the case. Hynes then ordered a review
of the case. It ended with his decision to join Ms. Fox's motion to
Kreindler to dismiss the conviction and the charges that led to it.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Hynes, Patrick Clark, credited Ms. Fox and
Herbert for setting in motion the events that led to Thursday's
court session. An assistant district attorney, Jon Besunder, told
Kreindler Thursday that his office was now ``convinced that Garner
was not a witness to the crime'' and that there was no other
evidence implicating Blake.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the five-year statute of limitations, Garner cannot
be prosecuted for what the authorities now say was his perjury at
the 1991 trial. Prosecutors and Janice Mitchell, an investigator
for the Legal Aid Society who worked on the case, said they did not
know Garner's whereabouts, and a telephone listing in Brooklyn for
that name carries an unpublished number.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At a news conference at the Legal Aid Society's offices in
Manhattan _ where Blake asked for Kentucky Fried Chicken, ``extra
crispy,'' as his first meal in freedom _ he said of Garner: ``I
really have no feeling against him. Now I appreciate what he did in
coming forward and letting them know he was lying.''
</P>
<P>
   As to whether he was bitter over his conviction and years in
prison, Blake said: ``Not really. Right now I'm just happy it's
over.''
</P>
<P>
   With two of his sisters and a nephew at his side, Blake spoke of
a future in which he would work with prisoners convicted of crimes
they did not commit, saying that there were thousands of such
cases.

HEAT DAMAGE FOUND IN WIRES OF SWISSAIR VIDEO SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Canada)  (lb) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Investigators looking into the crash last month of
Swissair Flight 111 off the coast of Nova Scotia have found ``heat
damage'' in wires from the plane's in-flight entertainment system,
prompting the airline to disconnect the system on all of its jumbo
jets, Swissair officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Safety Board of Canada said in a statement
that there was not enough information to determine whether the heat
damage was a possible source of the smoke that the pilots reported
in the cockpit shortly before the crash, or whether it was ``merely
the byproduct of other events.''
</P>
<P>
   One aviation safety official called it ``a circumstantial
clue.''
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment system installed by Swissair is apparently not
used by any other airline, although the Federal Aviation
Administration _ which approved the installation for Swissair _
said that if it found an airline using the same equipment, it would
ask that the system be turned off.
</P>
<P>
   The system is installed on the first-class and business-class
seats of Swissair's 15 surviving MD-11s and its three 747s. It
includes a video screen that unfolds from the armrest like a tray
table and can be used by a passenger to watch a variety of movies
or play casino-style games.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the airline, Jackie Pash, stressed that
investigators had not determined what role, if any, the system
played in the crash. ``People are going to immediately think this
is a cause of 111, and that has not been determined at all,'' she
said. ``Swissair is interested in taking any precautionary
measures, as you can imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   About 70 percent of the plane has been recovered, and work is
continuing to find more of it.
</P>
<P>
   From the parts that have been recovered, investigators have
found that much of the heat damage is concentrated in an area above
the ceiling, over the wall that divides the cockpit from the
first-class cabin.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Harris, a spokesman for the Transportation Safety Board,
said that the forward area, the area that is of the greatest
interest to investigators, is also the most badly shattered,
apparently having hit first. The investigators recently identified
wiring from the entertainment system as being heat-damaged and
coming from that area over the wall.
</P>
<P>
   The plane crashed on Sept. 2, on a flight from Kennedy
International Airport in New York to Switzerland, killing all 229
people aboard. The pilots had reported smoke in the cockpit 16
minutes before the crash. Investigators have avoided using the word
``fire,'' saying instead that components are heat-damaged.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The system was designed and manufactured by Interactive Flight
Technologies of Phoenix, a company that subsequently got out of the
business because it could not make additional sales. A spokeswoman,
Marsha Malone, said Thursday that she could not give any
information about the system installed on the Swissair planes.
</P>
<P>
   Les Dorr, a spokesman for the FAA, said his agency had inspected
one Swissair MD-11, concentrating on the wiring in the forward part
of the plane, including the entertainment system, and that Swissair
itself had inspected three more that were undergoing maintenance.
No safety problems were found on any of the planes, he said. He
added that the inspections were ``in areas that were readily
accessible, where we didn't have to take anything apart.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the FAA was re-examining the design and
installation of the system on the Swissair planes, but that the
agency had not asked any other airlines to inspect their
entertainment systems.
</P>
<P>
   Such systems are a major point of competition among airlines
offering first-class or business-class service over long routes.
They can require large amounts of electric current, and thus
generate substantial heat. David Sebring, the chief engineer for
cabin systems at Boeing Co., said in an interview in August that on
a big jet the system can use 30 kilowatts _ enough electricity to
run several large suburban houses.

2 LITTLE-KNOWN RIVALS IN FIERCE FIGHT FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (DUPLICATION NOTICE: Also sent in category `p') 
(bl) 
 This article is based on reporting by Raymond Hernandez, Terry
Pristin and David Firestone and was written by Firestone.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is just below the U.S. Senate race in its intensity, bursting
with bitter invective and sharply contrasting political views, but
the campaign to become New York state attorney general is being
fought by two men almost unknown to the public.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Dennis Vacco, a Republican, has been attorney
general for the last four years, but a poll released this week by
The New York Times showed that 73 percent of likely voters
questioned had no opinion of him or his work.
</P>
<P>
   That is only slightly less than the 79 percent of voters with no
opinion of his Democratic challenger, Eliot Spitzer, who has never
held elective office, though the poll showed that Vacco was
comfortably ahead of his rival.
</P>
<P>
   Given the public's indifference to the race, and its general
lack of knowledge of the duties of the office, the two candidates
have spent more time attacking each other than outlining a broad
vision of the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   Both have seized on gaffes and misstatements made by the other,
including accusations that Vacco made a racial slur against
Hispanic people and that Spitzer has not been forthcoming about the
source of his campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   But, in fact, there are substantial differences in the outlooks
of the two men, beginning with their definition of the attorney
general's job.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Vacco was swept into office on a tide of upstate
support for Gov. George Pataki, having run on a platform of
fighting crime more vigorously while cutting back prosecution of
corporate fraud and pollution. It was an unusual approach, given
that the office has traditionally handled non-criminal litigation
for the state, leaving most criminal cases to district attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco, 46, spent his first two years in office increasing
criminal prosecutions, championing the death penalty and hunting
down sex offenders and Internet pedophiles. At the same time, he
dismissed many experienced staff members who had enforced
environmental, consumer and abortion-clinic laws, replacing them
with political appointees and campaign workers. The widespread
turnover produced several legal errors that drew reprimands from
several judges who questioned the competence of the office.
</P>
<P>
   It is those non-criminal issues that lead the agenda of Spitzer,
39, a former state prosecutor in Manhattan who helped start a
public-interest law firm in 1992. Two years later, he lost the
Democratic primary for the right to challenge Vacco.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer, who has admitted making misleading statements about how
much of his father's fortune is paying for his campaign, has
accused Vacco of eviscerating the traditional focus of the office
in deference to corporate contributions, and has promised to return
to a pro-consumer orientation championed by former Attorneys
General Louis Lefkowitz and Robert Abrams.
</P>
<P>
   As if anticipating each other's campaign platforms, each
candidate has moved closer to the other in the last year or so,
setting aside party dogma in favor of middle-of-the-road positions
intended to appeal to an increasingly moderate electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco has taken on more consumer cases and large corporations
like Microsoft, and his literature now says that under his
leadership, ``the attorney general's office's traditional roles as
a consumer and environmental protector have greatly expanded.'' At
the same time, Spitzer is stressing his support for the death
penalty and his work prosecuting white-collar criminals.
</P>
<P>
   But to the extent that voters have become aware of the campaign,
it is through the candidates' attack advertisements, and those have
centered on two issues: Whether Vacco has allowed patronage and
cronyism to dictate his choice of staff members and legal targets,
and whether Spitzer has been misleading in disclosing the source of
his campaign funds. There appears to be some truth in each
candidate's charges, but there remain many other issues that divide
the two men, who come from very different backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco grew up on a grape and vegetable farm in a small town
south of Buffalo, where he worked the fields as early as age 11. He
got his professional start as a prosecutor in 1978 with the Erie
County district attorney's office after graduating from the
University of Buffalo Law School, and went on to become the U.S.
attorney for western New York at the relatively young age of 36.
</P>
<P>
   He secured the job in large part through the intervention of his
political patron, U.S. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, who eventually
engineered his candidacy for attorney general in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after taking office in January 1995, Vacco was widely
criticized for attempting to rescind a 15-year policy of protecting
homosexuals from job discrimination in his agency, something he now
says he regrets. That move came in the wake of a bitterly fought
election campaign in which Vacco and his allies questioned the
fitness for office of his opponent, Karen Burstein, because she was
a lesbian.
</P>
<P>
   A more lasting criticism arose when Vacco was accused of
compromising the office's long tradition of nonpartisan
professionalism by firing dozens of experienced lawyers hired by
his Democratic predecessors and replacing them with younger,
inexperienced lawyers with ties to the Republican and Conservative
Parties.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year of his taking office, 128 of the 450 lawyers on
his staff had been dismissed, and 91 more had left voluntarily.
Dozens of the positions were filled with new hires who were related
to or had close ties to Republican leaders or campaign
contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco originally said his staff members were hired on their
merits, but after a series of lawsuits produced evidence showing
that many resumes were marked as friends of prominent Republicans
or campaign workers, he acknowledged in 1996 that political
considerations did play a role in many of his appointments. He said
it was appropriate to hire people who agreed with his philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's performance, performance, their performance on the job,
that's what counts,'' he said in a recent interview. ``A lot of
people, including the press, have ignored the reality of what we've
accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the high staff turnover, however, many of his
office's cases were thrown into disarray, and several judges
complained publicly about the competence of his staff. Vacco's
judicial record, in fact, is filled with reprimands from federal
and state judges about missed deadlines and frivolous motions; one
federal judge in 1996 referred to ``a series of unending failures
by the office of the attorney general in this case to comply either
with court orders or with counsel's obligation as an officer of the
court.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Vacco's highest-ranking aide, William Flynn,
was shown in court papers to have failed the bar exam seven times
in five years and practiced law before finally passing and
receiving his law license in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco has earned a mixed reputation among prosecutors around New
York state. Many district attorneys, especially those in small
counties, say they are grateful for the help they get from his
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis has been terrific here,'' said Michael Kavanagh, the
longtime district attorney of Ulster County, citing the assistance
he received from Vacco's office when he prosecuted the state's
first death penalty case. ``We could not have done that prosecution
without his help.''
</P>
<P>
   But a number of prosecutors complained that Vacco exceeded his
authority _ and usurped theirs _ when he started a criminal case on
his own in 1995. He brought a criminal case against Israel Romero,
a Honduran lawyer, accusing him of unauthorized practice of law.
The New York State District Attorneys Association, which represents
the state's 62 county prosecutors, filed a brief arguing that Vacco
had no jurisdiction to bring that kind of criminal case, a position
later upheld by the state's highest court.
</P>
<P>
   Although Vacco is personally opposed to abortion, his office has
filed several court briefs supporting a buffer zone around abortion
clinics to keep anti-abortion protesters from harassing patients
and doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer, who supports abortion rights, has tried to blame
Vacco's office for not doing enough to protect clinics, which he
said made it easier last week for a sniper to kill a Buffalo doctor
who performed abortions.
</P>
<P>
   But Lucinda Finley, a Buffalo lawyer who has represented several
clinics seeking protection from anti-abortion protesters, said
Vacco's office had been ``extraordinarily helpful'' in helping to
win court protection, including submitting a brief to the U.S.
Supreme Court that helped lead to a decision last year upholding a
15-foot buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco casts himself as a defender of consumers, a protector of
the environment and a champion of women's issues, though his
critics say he is doing little more than paying lip service to
these issues. ``People view me in a one-dimensional, crime-fighting
posture,'' he said. ``There's more to my office.''
</P>
<P>
   Vacco has become a convert on the contentious issue of tobacco
litigation. When he first took office, he refused to join a
nationwide lawsuit that sought to recoup from tobacco makers the
billions of dollars that states spent treating tobacco-related
illnesses. He said that would be akin to suing dairy producers for
cholesterol-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
   His position led critics to charge that he was soft on cigarette
makers only because they were major contributors to the state
Republican Party. He eventually joined in the lawsuits against the
tobacco companies and became an outspoken critic of the industry,
though his critics, including Spitzer, contend that his conversion
was a political move.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer grew up in Riverdale in the Bronx, the son of a wealthy
New York City real-estate developer, Bernard Spitzer, who has lent
millions to his son's campaign for office. The younger Spitzer
attended Princeton University and Harvard Law School, where he was
an editor of the law review, and later became head of the labor
racketeering unit in the Manhattan district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   He was lead prosecutor in the 1992 case against Thomas and
Joseph Gambino, reputed capos in the Gambino crime family, who
dominated the trucking business in the garment industry. Vacco has
criticized the plea bargain that ended the case, in which the
Gambinos pleaded guilty but avoided jail by paying a $12 million
fine and agreeing to get out of the garment industry.
</P>
<P>
   But Spitzer, echoing the comments of law enforcement officials
at the time, said it was more important to clean up the industry
than to put the two men in jail.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the prosecutor's office in 1992, he co-founded the
New York office of the Center for the Community Interest, a
centrist and occasionally center-right public-interest law group
that promotes quality-of-life issues, often in opposition to
civil-liberties groups.
</P>
<P>
   The center, for example, has supported the attempt by New York
City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's administration to reduce the number
of adult-entertainment businesses in the city, drafted ordinances
to crack down on aggressive panhandling and helped community groups
remove dangerous mentally ill people from the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer calls himself a ``pragmatic liberal,'' but his more
centrist philosophy has kept this year's race from becoming the
purely ideological contest that Ms. Burstein and Vacco waged four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Spitzer has focused mostly on issues that he says Vacco
has neglected, proposing an office of public integrity under the
attorney general to monitor state government, new regulations on
cable companies and the use of product liability laws to force gun
manufacturers to install safety locks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be the greatest public-interest law firm that the
state has ever seen,'' Spitzer said of the office.

 &HT;    Respect from respective sidelines
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ It was moments before kickoff at last
year's Georgia-Florida game. Florida coach Steve Spurrier, alone
with his thoughts, was walking along the floor of Alltell Stadium
when a friend stopped him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look a little worried,'' the friend said. ``What's
wrong?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That guy over there,'' said Spurrier, pointing across the
field to Georgia coach Jim Donnan. ``The Georgia kids are going to
play hard for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier's instincts were right. Georgia rolled to a 37-17
victory, its first against the Gators since Spurrier became coach
in 1990. In the process, Donnan and Georgia sent a message that
Spurrier and the Gators have received loud and clear: After some
lean years, the Bulldogs are on the way to becoming a constant
thorn in Florida's side, as they were in the 1960s, '70s and '80s.
</P>
<P>
   And Spurrier, who once saw Tennessee as his only constant
challenge to SEC supremacy, knows he will have to contend with
Georgia on a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``They certainly outplayed us and outcoached us last year, no
question about it,'' Spurrier said. ``Jim did some really good
things with his team in that game. It certainly got our
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big win for the building of our program, because
Steve has set the standard in the SEC during the '90s,'' Donnan
said. ``He has had a greater impact on this league than just about
anybody but Bear Bryant. I think he's got the best offensive mind
in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   If you think it sounds like a mutual admiration society, you are
be right. The two men first met in 1978 when both interviewed for
assistant jobs at Florida. Spurrier was just getting out of the
NFL. Donnan was 32 years old and had just missed out on getting the
head job at North Carolina. Spurrier joined the Gators as
quarterbacks coach.
</P>
<P>
   Donnan decided to go to Kansas State because Gator coach Doug
Dickey had only one year left on his contract. Donnan's instincts
were right.
</P>
<P>
   Dickey was fired after the 1978 season and replaced by Charley
Pell. ``(Spurrier) was just coming out of pro ball and knew a lot
about the game but not a lot about being a coach,'' Donnan said.
``So I had a chance to talk to him about coaching, and he talked to
me about X's and O's.''
</P>
<P>
   When Spurrier was with the USFL's Tampa Bay Bandits (1983-85),
Donnan was the quarterbacks and receivers coach at Missouri. He
would call Spurrier occasionally to talk about some of his players.
</P>
<P>
   The same year Donnan became a head coach at Marshall (1990),
Spurrier was taking over at Florida. Donnan used some of Spurrier's
principles in setting up the Thundering Herd's record-setting
offense.
</P>
<P>
   So when Donnan was hired at Georgia in December of 1995, he
didn't see Spurrier as a threat or as the Evil Genius, as some
Bulldogs refer to him. Spurrier had won four of his five SEC
championships by then; it was Donnan's job to take Georgia's
program to that level.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the resources we have here at Georgia, and with the
talent base in this state, there is no reason we can't compete with
Florida year in and year out,'' Donnan said. ``I think Steve knows
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier also learned another important lesson in last year's
loss to Georgia. He is still the master in the SEC when it comes to
drawing up ``ball plays,'' as he likes to call them. But the guy on
the other side wearing the red and black also is a very good coach.
</P>
<P>
   Donnan's offensive game plan against Florida last season
thoroughly confused Florida's nationally ranked defense. He used
Hines Ward at quarterback and ran the option. He found a way to
block Florida's strong front wall, enabling the Bulldogs to rush
for more than 100 yards on seven toss sweeps. When Florida rallied
from a 14-3 deficit to take a 17-14 lead in the third quarter,
Donnan calmly called an 11-play, 78-yard drive for a touchdown.
Georgia took the lead 21-17 and never trailed again.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, Georgia had 434 yards of total offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we showed them some things they weren't sure we could
do,'' said Donnan. ``Spurrier's good, but we can draw up a few
plays, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnan's plays are not the only things getting Florida's
attention. Georgia is doing something it previously found very
difficult: competing with the Gators for a Florida recruit, and
winning. In February, the Bulldogs signed linebacker William
Witherspoon from Panama City, the USA Today Player of the Year in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've still got a ways to go before we can compare our program
to Florida's, because they've had so much success,'' Donnan said.
``But we're headed in that direction. Let us get a couple more
recruiting classes, and we'll see.''

 &HT;    Singh has early lead with record round
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ So much for predictions of a Tour-ture Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Just when all the pre-tournament comments suggested a weary week
of arm wrestling with Old Man Par, Vijay Singh took a wrecking ball
to East Lake Golf Club Thursday with a 7-under-par 63.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbelievable,'' Singh, the current PGA champion, said after a
round of eight birdies and one bogey. ``I think it's probably one
of the best rounds I've ever had from tee to green.''
</P>
<P>
   Singh played with Tiger Woods and beat him by 12 shots. Driving
the ball long and accurately to avoid East Lake's penalizing rough,
the Fiji native, despite a three-putt bogey at the par-3 18th hole,
broke by three shots the competitive course record (66) shot in the
1997 U.S. Open qualifier by Marietta's Larry Nelson, with 72 as the
par.
</P>
<P>
   Singh's 63 tied the lowest round ever shot in a Tour
Championship. The low score at East Lake before the course was
reworked in 1995 was a 62 by Atlanta amateur Tommy Barnes, played
from a par 72. Bobby Jones shot a 63 at East Lake in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was an exceptional round for anybody to shoot around
here,'' Singh said.
</P>
<P>
   The leaderboard after the first round of the Tour Championship
saw 12 players of the PGA Tour's top 30 money winners either break
or match par. Singh holds a three-shot lead over Billy Mayfair, the
1995 Tour Championship winner (66), and leads by four shots over
1996 winner Tom Lehman and last year's runner-up Jim Furyk, who had
67's. Five strokes back at 68 are Jeff Sluman and Justin Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   The surprising news involved the two best players in the game _
David Duval and Woods _ tied for next to last at 5-over 75.

 &HT;    Fast, hard conditions similar to Mayfair's '95 win at Tulsa
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Billy Mayfair's history is not to waste his
appearances in the Tour Championship. Making the top 30 three other
times in his career, Mayfair finished second in 1990. He slipped to
30th in 1993, but won in 1995. On Thursday, he began this year's
Tour Championship at East Lake Golf Club with a 4-under-par 66 that
kept leader Vijay Singh at least in sight.
</P>
<P>
   There's no rain in sight, either, meaning course conditions will
remain firm and fast. It was precisely that way at Southern Hills
in Tulsa in 1995, when Mayfair won with an even-par 280.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I kind of like fast golf courses when the fairways are
fast and the greens are fast and kind of hard,'' Mayfair said.
``Tulsa (in 1995) was that way. Today, standing on the first tee,
the leaves were blowing all over the place, kind of like it was
there.''
</P>
<P>
   On any other day _ one without a Singh 63 _ Mayfair's round
probably would have made the ESPN highlights. He had 14 pars and
four birdies, feasting on uphill putts that lessened the risk on
East Lake's speedy greens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the type of course you can shoot 4-under on one day, play
just as well the next day and shoot a couple over,'' said Mayfair,
who was 79th on the money list a year ago and 13th this time.
</P>
<P>
   Rare day for Woods
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods, who has a strong success rate in Georgia with wins
at the 1997 Masters and 1998 BellSouth Classic, already is 12 shots
off the lead after a 75 that was matched by leading money winner
David Duval. Only U.S. Open champion Lee Janzen finished worse,
with a 7-over 77. It marked the first time in two years (49 events)
that Woods had played a round without a birdie. ``I didn't hit the
ball well all day,'' Woods said. ``I was all over the map. My swing
didn't feel good all day.'' Woods double-bogeyed the par-5 ninth
hole, hitting into the pond on his second shot, from the rough. ...
``I was playing fine,'' Duval said after bogeys on three of the
last four holes. ``It's just a shame the course wasn't too nice to
me.'' ... The twosome of Nick Price and Jeff Sluman played through
the Bob Tway-Tom Lehman group at the 16th hole. Tway hit his second
shot near a stationary TV camera and waited 15 minutes for a rules
official to arrive. Extra careful not to be disqualified in a
tournament where the guarantee for last place is $64,000, Tway
said, ``All you've got to do is finish.''
</P>
<P>
   A familiar face
</P>
<P>
   As he strolls around East Lake this week, tournament chairman
Billy Payne is recognized by more spectators than are many of the
lesser-known pros at East Lake. Payne didn't have any trouble
rustling up 1,000 volunteers to put on the Tour Championship; he
still has a list of 50,000 who helped him put on the 1996 Olympics.
Some called him offering to serve. Payne is a 10-handicapper who
unsuccessfully lobbied to get the sport added to the Atlanta Games,
with Augusta National Golf Club as the venue. ``I'm not dwelling on
that this week,'' he said. ``I do think the Olympics missed one of
their greatest opportunities, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Looping for dollars
</P>
<P>
   Seven players in the field will make less this week than the
winning caddie. Most tour players pay their caddies 10 percent for
a win. For the Tour Championship, with a $720,000 first prize, that
will mean a $72,000 payday _ equal to that of the 23rd finisher.
Bob Riefke, who caddies for Justin Leonard, also saw a $72,000
check when his man won The Players Championship in March. ``He made
more,'' said fellow caddie Greg Rita, ``than half the field at
TPC.'' ...

2 LITTLE-KNOWN RIVALS IN FIERCE FIGHT FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (DUPLICATION NOTICE: Also sent in category `a') 
(bl) 
 This article is based on reporting by Raymond Hernandez, Terry
Pristin and David Firestone and was written by Firestone.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is just below the U.S. Senate race in its intensity, bursting
with bitter invective and sharply contrasting political views, but
the campaign to become New York state attorney general is being
fought by two men almost unknown to the public.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Dennis Vacco, a Republican, has been attorney
general for the last four years, but a poll released this week by
The New York Times showed that 73 percent of likely voters
questioned had no opinion of him or his work.
</P>
<P>
   That is only slightly less than the 79 percent of voters with no
opinion of his Democratic challenger, Eliot Spitzer, who has never
held elective office, though the poll showed that Vacco was
comfortably ahead of his rival.
</P>
<P>
   Given the public's indifference to the race, and its general
lack of knowledge of the duties of the office, the two candidates
have spent more time attacking each other than outlining a broad
vision of the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   Both have seized on gaffes and misstatements made by the other,
including accusations that Vacco made a racial slur against
Hispanic people and that Spitzer has not been forthcoming about the
source of his campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   But, in fact, there are substantial differences in the outlooks
of the two men, beginning with their definition of the attorney
general's job.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Vacco was swept into office on a tide of upstate
support for Gov. George Pataki, having run on a platform of
fighting crime more vigorously while cutting back prosecution of
corporate fraud and pollution. It was an unusual approach, given
that the office has traditionally handled non-criminal litigation
for the state, leaving most criminal cases to district attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco, 46, spent his first two years in office increasing
criminal prosecutions, championing the death penalty and hunting
down sex offenders and Internet pedophiles. At the same time, he
dismissed many experienced staff members who had enforced
environmental, consumer and abortion-clinic laws, replacing them
with political appointees and campaign workers. The widespread
turnover produced several legal errors that drew reprimands from
several judges who questioned the competence of the office.
</P>
<P>
   It is those non-criminal issues that lead the agenda of Spitzer,
39, a former state prosecutor in Manhattan who helped start a
public-interest law firm in 1992. Two years later, he lost the
Democratic primary for the right to challenge Vacco.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer, who has admitted making misleading statements about how
much of his father's fortune is paying for his campaign, has
accused Vacco of eviscerating the traditional focus of the office
in deference to corporate contributions, and has promised to return
to a pro-consumer orientation championed by former Attorneys
General Louis Lefkowitz and Robert Abrams.
</P>
<P>
   As if anticipating each other's campaign platforms, each
candidate has moved closer to the other in the last year or so,
setting aside party dogma in favor of middle-of-the-road positions
intended to appeal to an increasingly moderate electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco has taken on more consumer cases and large corporations
like Microsoft, and his literature now says that under his
leadership, ``the attorney general's office's traditional roles as
a consumer and environmental protector have greatly expanded.'' At
the same time, Spitzer is stressing his support for the death
penalty and his work prosecuting white-collar criminals.
</P>
<P>
   But to the extent that voters have become aware of the campaign,
it is through the candidates' attack advertisements, and those have
centered on two issues: Whether Vacco has allowed patronage and
cronyism to dictate his choice of staff members and legal targets,
and whether Spitzer has been misleading in disclosing the source of
his campaign funds. There appears to be some truth in each
candidate's charges, but there remain many other issues that divide
the two men, who come from very different backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco grew up on a grape and vegetable farm in a small town
south of Buffalo, where he worked the fields as early as age 11. He
got his professional start as a prosecutor in 1978 with the Erie
County district attorney's office after graduating from the
University of Buffalo Law School, and went on to become the U.S.
attorney for western New York at the relatively young age of 36.
</P>
<P>
   He secured the job in large part through the intervention of his
political patron, U.S. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, who eventually
engineered his candidacy for attorney general in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after taking office in January 1995, Vacco was widely
criticized for attempting to rescind a 15-year policy of protecting
homosexuals from job discrimination in his agency, something he now
says he regrets. That move came in the wake of a bitterly fought
election campaign in which Vacco and his allies questioned the
fitness for office of his opponent, Karen Burstein, because she was
a lesbian.
</P>
<P>
   A more lasting criticism arose when Vacco was accused of
compromising the office's long tradition of nonpartisan
professionalism by firing dozens of experienced lawyers hired by
his Democratic predecessors and replacing them with younger,
inexperienced lawyers with ties to the Republican and Conservative
Parties.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year of his taking office, 128 of the 450 lawyers on
his staff had been dismissed, and 91 more had left voluntarily.
Dozens of the positions were filled with new hires who were related
to or had close ties to Republican leaders or campaign
contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco originally said his staff members were hired on their
merits, but after a series of lawsuits produced evidence showing
that many resumes were marked as friends of prominent Republicans
or campaign workers, he acknowledged in 1996 that political
considerations did play a role in many of his appointments. He said
it was appropriate to hire people who agreed with his philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's performance, performance, their performance on the job,
that's what counts,'' he said in a recent interview. ``A lot of
people, including the press, have ignored the reality of what we've
accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the high staff turnover, however, many of his
office's cases were thrown into disarray, and several judges
complained publicly about the competence of his staff. Vacco's
judicial record, in fact, is filled with reprimands from federal
and state judges about missed deadlines and frivolous motions; one
federal judge in 1996 referred to ``a series of unending failures
by the office of the attorney general in this case to comply either
with court orders or with counsel's obligation as an officer of the
court.''

 &HT;    Lehman puts his shoulder to the wheel
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ While home nursing a shoulder injury that made it hard
for him to draw the ball, Tom Lehman drew greens and fairways. The
player known for hitting the ball right-to-left already has
designed courses in Tucson and Minneapolis and is working on one in
Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   But Lehman, tied for third in the Tour Championship after
shooting a 67 Thursday, would have a hard time conjuring up a
course to match the mystique of the East Lake Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the one thing that I enjoy most about this place has
nothing to do with the golf course,'' said Lehman, who won the Tour
Championship in 1996 and hopes to become the first in the event's
12-year-history to win it twice. ``It has to do with the pictures
up near the locker room.''
</P>
<P>
   In the hallway are framed newspaper pages chronicling Bobby
Jones' career. But Lehman is just as awed by the baseball box
scores: ``Ruth went 2-for-5. Gehrig was 3-for-4. The history, that
just blows my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   And the golf course? ``The bunkering, the shaping of the
fairways, the greens, to me it's a very fitting, classical golf
course,'' Lehman said.
</P>
<P>
   The course definitely fit his game. On what the golfer from
Scottsdale, Ariz., called ``an exceptional day,'' he shot
3-under-par to tie Jim Furyk for third, four shots behind Vijay
Singh. Lehman had no bogeys, ``can't recall even being on the
fringe'' and hit every green. He had birdies on holes 4, 9 and 17.
</P>
<P>
   And best of all, Lehman's right shoulder felt fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will feel great one day and awful the next,'' said Lehman,
who figures he's about 80 percent healed. He injured it during the
British Open in July while on an amusement park ride with his kids.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman had to take a few weeks off because his swing was getting
worse, and he feared, ``I may really ingrain something bad'' in it.
</P>
<P>
   He has problems when the front of his shoulder tightens up, but
the back is weak, causing his shoulder to pull forward in an
awkward position.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the days that I wake up and I feel really tight, I
struggle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, 39, the PGA Tour player of the year in 1996, hasn't won
since the '96 Tour Championship in Tulsa, when he shared the
first-round lead with Singh at 66. Lehman won the tournament by six
strokes and led the money list with more than $1.7 million. But
this year he slipped to No. 27 and risked not making the 30-man
field here.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman has a lot to play for this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just pride is one thing,'' he said. ``I haven't really been in
contention in a while, so I'd like to play a good tournament
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, who will play in the Skins Game, also wants to earn a
spot in the field for the Presidents Cup, where the course in
Melbourne, Australia, favors his game. But will his shoulder be
ready?
</P>
<P>
   ``A month from now,'' Lehman said, ``it will be even better
yet.''

 &HT;    Neighborhood's seeming seediness off-putting to some
 &HT;    By Michelle Hiskey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The burglar bars were the first clue. A big golf fan
who has attended almost all the pro events in Georgia, Gary Reeser,
38, immediately noticed them over the doors and windows on houses
all around East Lake Golf Club. Stark metal grids _ instead of
those discreet little ``this home protected by'' signs sprouting on
well-manicured lawns around the country clubs that usually host pro
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   That was three weeks ago, when he drove to the course in
anticipation of following the best 30 pro golfers on the PGA Tour
this week. He headed home to Kennesaw, where he called his brother
Keith, who was flying in from Boise, Idaho, to accompany him to the
Tour Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember when we used to go to Watts, to the L.A. Coliseum?''
He asked him. ``This course is in the middle of a slum.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not the worst part of the city, but it's not the gated
subdivision that golf fans like these are used to coming to either.
On Thursday morning, the brothers headed out to watch the first
round of the PGA Tour's richest tournament. They were happy to park
their 1998 Chevy Malibu at Turner Field with the other shiny sports
cars, minivans and sport utilities.
</P>
<P>
   All but one of the other 36 people on the shuttle were white, as
the Reesers are. They dressed the way golf fans do on a sunny,
80-degree day, entry passes dangling from their pleated shorts and
polo shirts, logoed hats on their heads, shod in moccasins and
wingtips.
</P>
<P>
   Milo Bowes steered the bus onto I-20 east for the six-mile trip.
He knew exactly where he was going; he used to drive the East Lake
route for MARTA. He remembered wheeling into the East Lake Meadows
housing project, once known as ``Little Vietnam,'' to find blue
lights and a drug bust, and police making him detour.
</P>
<P>
   But things are different these days, and East Lake Meadows is in
the midst of a renovation project that makes it a mixed-income
housing area. Bowes tries to put a positive spin on things. If
someone asks, ``I don't say the word `project,' '' he said.
``That's kind of a downer.''
</P>
<P>
   He turned off at the Glenwood Avenue exit and headed past
Goodwill Industries and a heavily caged store selling money orders,
lottery tickets and meat.
</P>
<P>
   Outside his left window loomed a blocky, brownish apartment
complex, part of what's left of East Lake Meadows. Chatter rose on
the bus as golf fans pointed at it. When the East Lake renovation
is complete, townhomes and trails will be there instead.
</P>
<P>
   A huge poster pointed them to the tournament. It shared a pole
with a red-yellow-and-blue MARTA bus-stop sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so out of place, that we're going to attend the
richest tournament of the year in the middle of this,'' said Keith,
32, an engineer.
</P>
<P>
   At the corner of Second Avenue, across from a combination car
wash and pager store, a policeman waved the bus left through
traffic cones. A block down was valet parking for VIPs under tall
pine trees; across the street, Bob Estes and Jeff Maggert played
the fourth hole. ``If all those trees weren't there, the golfers
could see right through to the projects,'' Gary said.
</P>
<P>
   The bus turned right down Alston Avenue, where nearly all the
houses have been renovated so stylishly that it would was easier to
miss the burglar bars on most of the windows. ``You can tell at one
time these were very upscale, country-club homes, and the golf
course was thriving,'' Gary said. ``This was a nice neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   The bus came to a shady pine-straw-covered concession area,
where smiling volunteers helped the fans off the bus.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the shuttle would return to the stadium down Memorial
Drive, past a burned-out storefront, a razor-wire fence and
someone's front lawn, where the sole ornament was an oven for sale.
The buses would pass a strip mall containing a furniture
liquidator, pawn shop and beeper store, past a vendor with vanity
car tags flapping in the breeze. ``Show me the money,'' one read.
</P>
<P>
   But that trip would not be for a few hours, not until the
Reesers had watched 30 golfers compete for $4 million around a
sparkling lake and a cathedral-like Tudor clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a curtain goes up, and you get off this bus and walk
into a new world,'' Gary said.
</P>
<P>
   His brother agreed as they went in search of Fred Couples, David
Duval and Tiger Woods: ``It's kind of like you forget about what
it's like outside this door.

<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Florida has arguably the best linebacker corps in
college football. If there's a faster starting trio in the nation,
some say, it's in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Gators junior Jevon Kearse, expected to be a top NFL draft pick
if he leaves Gainesville a year early, could be the nation's top
defensive player. The 6-foot-5, 250-pound strongside linebacker is
one of 10 semifinalists for the Butkus Award, along with teammate
Johnny Rutledge, a senior playing his first season in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   And senior Mike Peterson, who plays on the weak side, would be
the top linebacker on most teams, but he often is overshadowed by
his more heralded teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Through seven games this year, the trio has combined for 179
tackles, 11 sacks and 65 ``big plays'' for the Gators, who are
ranked sixth nationally in total defense entering Saturday's game
against No. 11 Georgia in Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Bulldogs, looking to upset No. 5 Florida for the
second year in a row, are getting it done with a no-name linebacker
corps. After losing two of its top three tacklers from a year ago,
Georgia has two first-year starters and a pair of freshmen making
major contributions at linebacker down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you lose the experience we lost, and you're talking
about playing true freshmen, there's a little bit of
apprehension,'' Dogs linebackers coach Brad Lambert said. ``But I
knew what to expect coming in. I like (Georgia coach Jim) Donnan's
philosophy of playing the best players, regardless of experience.
The first thing I look for is guys that can run.''
</P>
<P>
   The most celebrated of Georgia's linebackers is junior Orantes
Grant, a 6-foot-1, 222-pound weakside linebacker from Dunwoody
High. He has played in all 29 games since arriving in Athens in
1996 and finished second on the team last season with 81 tackles.
This year, Grant has helped fill the void of departed starters Greg
Bright and Brandon Tolbert, totaling a team-high 75 tackles and
eight pass breakups in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been an undersized linebacker,'' Grant said.
``That's always how it has been. But that's what's really driven
me. I've wanted people to see that I can play like a big-time
linebacker.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what Grant did in the Dogs' 28-26 win at Kentucky
last week. Grant finished with a career-high 22 tackles, including
17 first hits, and turned in the game's key play in the first
quarter. With the 'Cats facing fourth-and-goal at the 1 and already
holding a 10-0 lead, Grant stopped quarterback Tim Couch for a
3-yard loss. The Bulldogs regained possession and drove 96 yards to
make it 10-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised because we hadn't seen that play in film all
week,'' Grant said. ``I knew I had to stay on the backside for the
naked (bootleg run). I actually bit on his fake (pitch to the
tailback), but then I saw Couch had the ball, and I just tackled
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore Adrian Hollingshed might be the best middle linebacker
you've never heard of. The Fort Valley native is second on the team
with 63 stops and is one of the team's best tacklers. Junior
strongside linebacker Dustin Luckie has 40 tackles and is third
with 2 1/2 sacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming into this season, the linebackers were definitely a
question mark,'' Grant said. ``But I think we've gotten some
experience, and we're starting to prove to people that we can
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's future at the position might be even better. Will
Witherspoon and Boss Bailey, two of the nation's top linebacker
recruits a year ago, are logging serious time as rookies.
Witherspoon is playing at both middle and weakside linebacker, and,
despite weighing only 212 pounds, is sixth on the team with 39
tackles.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey, the third of three brothers from Folkston to play at
Georgia, has fully recovered from a knee injury that shortened his
senior season at Charlton County High. He has 20 tackles at
strongside linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first came in, we learned the system pretty quickly,''
Bailey said. ``We're both pretty quick, and speed can overcome any
mistakes.

 &HT;    Booker looks to step up
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Falcons secondary coach Ron Meeks was on the
sidelines talking with second-year cornerback Michael Booker during
Thursday's practice, and the coach's voice was level. He wasn't
gesturing or yelling _ just talking shop. shop.
</P>
<P>
   It was a change from last year, when Meeks spent quite a bit of
time riding herd on the first draft choice of coach Dan Reeves'
era.
</P>
<P>
   When a player is drafted 11th overall, as Booker was last year,
the burden of great expectations is not optional. Booker did not
meet those expectations.
</P>
<P>
   He'll get a second chance to show his mettle Sunday in the
Georgia Dome against the Rams (2-5), when he'll replace Ronnie
Bradford, who is out three to six weeks with a sprained knee
ligament.
</P>
<P>
   Booker said he's more relaxed and better prepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a big burden off my chest not being this year's No.
1,'' he said. ``Last year was exciting, ... but there was a lot of
pressure. I felt like everybody was watching me, saying, `Let's see
what the first-round pick can do.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, when the coaches were yelling at me, it was like,
`Darn, I can't believe this.' This year, it's expected. I'm a lot
calmer on and off the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Booker has played better, too, although his time has been
limited by a strained thigh muscle that kept him out of two games
and bothers him still.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he replaced an injured Bradford in three starts. He
had 22 tackles, six passes defensed and three interceptions, but
two were desperation overthrows.
</P>
<P>
   Booker, a former Nebraska player, always looked good running out
on the field, with excellent size (6-feet-2, 203 pounds), good
speed and a physical style.
</P>
<P>
   But his inexperience often led to receivers spinning him like a
top.
</P>
<P>
   Booker's strength is still playing balls in front of him or to
his side, because of his quick acceleration. His chief liability is
deep coverage, although he has improved by sometimes conceding a
couple yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he hasn't come along as fast as we wanted (him) to, but
he's made progress,'' Meeks said. ``He's doing much, much better.
As he grasps things, and as he understands that the pace of the
game is different, he is adjusting mentally and physically.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta (5-2) originally had the No. 3 choice in last year's
draft. But Reeves traded down, getting Seattle's No. 11 pick, and
the Seahawks' second-round choice.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle drafted Ohio State cornerback Shawn Springs at No. 3.
After an erratic rookie season, he has been stellar this season.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta took Booker at No. 11 and with Seattle's second-round
pick chose running back Byron Hanspard, who's out for the season
with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Booker signed a five-year, $8.2 million contract. His salary-cap
number of $1.42 million is ninth-highest on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Many expected him to start from Day 1, but journeyman Bradford,
signed to play ``nickel'' back, won the job. Bradford played much
better than anticipated and Booker the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody is looking for that situation to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``In college, I wasn't technique-sound. I came in here, and
everything was about technique,'' he said. ``I had to backpedal
this way, bump that way, and I really didn't have any technique to
my press coverage. It was just simply getting my hands on
(receivers) and running with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I got to watch hips, and roll off (the bump) and read
coverages,'' Booker said. ``It's a big change. I tried not to take
it personally last year. This year, it is more personal. I was
playing for everyone else last year, trying to make everybody
happy. This year, I'm doing it for myself.

 &HT;    Banks has struggled, but not against Falcons
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When the St. Louis Rams come to Atlanta to play the
Falcons Sunday, it will be a relief. They've won just one of their
last nine home games, and fans and media are getting tired of
quarterback Tony Banks.
</P>
<P>
   In his brief career, Banks has seen his ups and downs, and he's
coming off a big downer. In last Sunday's 28-10 loss at home to the
49ers, he threw three interceptions and lost a fumble.
</P>
<P>
   His passer rating of 60.5 ranks 30th in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   A week earlier, he missed the team's flight to Miami. A day
after that, he skipped a film study session, drawing a $5,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dick Vermeil is sticking with him over Steve Bono, though,
and actually this is a bad week to rip Banks.
</P>
<P>
   Look what he's done against Atlanta:
</P>
<P>
   _ Completed 11-of-16 passes for 304 yards, three TDs and one
interception _ a passer rating of 124.9.
</P>
<P>
   _ Completed 15-of-24 passes for 188 yards and two TDs _ a rating
of 114.5.
</P>
<P>
   _ Completed 23-of-34 passes for a career-high 401 yards, two TDs
and one interception _ a rating of 114.9.
</P>
<P>
   _ Completed 21-of-38 passes for 266 yards and two TDS _ a rating
of 94.8.
</P>
<P>
   The last two weeks, though, he has completed just 29-of-64
passes (45.3 percent) for 264 yards, no TDs and four interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   MASH unit
</P>
<P>
   The Rams are even more beat up than the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, they'll be without TE Ernie Conwell, who's out for the
season with torn knee ligaments, and RB Amp Lee, who's out a few
weeks with a broken hand, and they might not have WR Isaac Bruce,
who missed practice again Thursday with a strained hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Those three have 60 percent of the Rams' receptions, and 61
percent of the receiving yards.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce put up those numbers despite missing two games, three if
you consider that he did not catch a pass last week before leaving
the game.
</P>
<P>
   If he doesn't play, the St. Louis WRs will be struggling Eddie
Kennison and Ricky Proehl.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this season, the Rams lost starting RB Greg Hill for the
season with a broken leg.
</P>
<P>
   Also RG Zach Wiegert (knee) and his backup, Mike Gruttadauria
(back spasms) missed practice Thursday for the second straight day,
and Tom Nutten could get his first NFL start.
</P>
<P>
   LT Orlando Pace has a badly bruised shoulder, but practiced.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie RB Robert Holcombe, bothered by knee and achilles
injuries, has just 67 yards on 40 carries the past three games.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons injury report
</P>
<P>
   Starting MLB Jessie Tuggle (ankle sprain) and starting right DT
Shane Dronett (torn foot muscle) returned to practice Thursday, and
both are listed as questionable. Also, QB Chris Chandler (strained
non-throwing shoulder and bruised ribs) continued to look stronger,
and almost certainly will start.
</P>
<P>
   But starting left DT Travis Hall (bruised knee) did not
practice, and reserve CB Randy Fuller continues to struggle with a
strained hamstring. Both are listed as ``questionable to
doubtful.''
</P>
<P>
   If Hall doesn't play, rather than start DT Esera Tuaolo, the
Falcons will move left DE Lester Archambeau to DT, and start John
Burrough at DE.

 UNDATED: the court.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Vacco's highest-ranking aide, William Flynn,
was shown in court papers to have failed the bar exam seven times
in five years and practiced law before finally passing and
receiving his law license in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco has earned a mixed reputation among prosecutors around New
York state. Many district attorneys, especially those in small
counties, say they are grateful for the help they get from his
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis has been terrific here,'' said Michael Kavanagh, the
longtime district attorney of Ulster County, citing the assistance
he received from Vacco's office when he prosecuted the state's
first death penalty case. ``We could not have done that prosecution
without his help.''
</P>
<P>
   But a number of prosecutors complained that Vacco exceeded his
authority _ and usurped theirs _ when he started a criminal case on
his own in 1995. He brought a criminal case against Israel Romero,
a Honduran lawyer, accusing him of unauthorized practice of law.
The New York State District Attorneys Association, which represents
the state's 62 county prosecutors, filed a brief arguing that Vacco
had no jurisdiction to bring that kind of criminal case, a position
later upheld by the state's highest court.
</P>
<P>
   Although Vacco is personally opposed to abortion, his office has
filed several court briefs supporting a buffer zone around abortion
clinics to keep anti-abortion protesters from harassing patients
and doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer, who supports abortion rights, has tried to blame
Vacco's office for not doing enough to protect clinics, which he
said made it easier last week for a sniper to kill a Buffalo doctor
who performed abortions.
</P>
<P>
   But Lucinda Finley, a Buffalo lawyer who has represented several
clinics seeking protection from anti-abortion protesters, said
Vacco's office had been ``extraordinarily helpful'' in helping to
win court protection, including submitting a brief to the U.S.
Supreme Court that helped lead to a decision last year upholding a
15-foot buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco casts himself as a defender of consumers, a protector of
the environment and a champion of women's issues, though his
critics say he is doing little more than paying lip service to
these issues. ``People view me in a one-dimensional, crime-fighting
posture,'' he said. ``There's more to my office.''
</P>
<P>
   Vacco has become a convert on the contentious issue of tobacco
litigation. When he first took office, he refused to join a
nationwide lawsuit that sought to recoup from tobacco makers the
billions of dollars that states spent treating tobacco-related
illnesses. He said that would be akin to suing dairy producers for
cholesterol-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
   His position led critics to charge that he was soft on cigarette
makers only because they were major contributors to the state
Republican Party. He eventually joined in the lawsuits against the
tobacco companies and became an outspoken critic of the industry,
though his critics, including Spitzer, contend that his conversion
was a political move.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer grew up in Riverdale in the Bronx, the son of a wealthy
New York City real-estate developer, Bernard Spitzer, who has lent
millions to his son's campaign for office. The younger Spitzer
attended Princeton University and Harvard Law School, where he was
an editor of the law review, and later became head of the labor
racketeering unit in the Manhattan district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   He was lead prosecutor in the 1992 case against Thomas and
Joseph Gambino, reputed capos in the Gambino crime family, who
dominated the trucking business in the garment industry. Vacco has
criticized the plea bargain that ended the case, in which the
Gambinos pleaded guilty but avoided jail by paying a $12 million
fine and agreeing to get out of the garment industry.
</P>
<P>
   But Spitzer, echoing the comments of law enforcement officials
at the time, said it was more important to clean up the industry
than to put the two men in jail.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the prosecutor's office in 1992, he co-founded the
New York office of the Center for the Community Interest, a
centrist and occasionally center-right public-interest law group
that promotes quality-of-life issues, often in opposition to
civil-liberties groups.
</P>
<P>
   The center, for example, has supported the attempt by New York
City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's administration to reduce the number
of adult-entertainment businesses in the city, drafted ordinances
to crack down on aggressive panhandling and helped community groups
remove dangerous mentally ill people from the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer calls himself a ``pragmatic liberal,'' but his more
centrist philosophy has kept this year's race from becoming the
purely ideological contest that Ms. Burstein and Vacco waged four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Spitzer has focused mostly on issues that he says Vacco
has neglected, proposing an office of public integrity under the
attorney general to monitor state government, new regulations on
cable companies and the use of product liability laws to force gun
manufacturers to install safety locks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be the greatest public-interest law firm that the
state has ever seen,'' Spitzer said of the office.

 &HT;    No-win weekend for Mariucci pal
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At his spacious office in the Breslin Center one
afternoon earlier this week, Michigan State basketball coach Tom
Izzo glanced at his calendar, noticed the green circle around
Sunday's date and groaned.
</P>
<P>
   A lifelong Green Bay fanatic, Izzo once again will be torn
between his allegiance to the Cheesehead Nation and friendship with
a former Packers loyalist, San Francisco 49ers coach Steve
Mariucci. The two grew up together in Iron Mountain, Mich.,
Mariucci with dreams of playing quarterback for the Packers and
Izzo harboring fantasies about being his pass-catching sidekick.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Mariucci became the Green Bay quarterback coach, and
Izzo grew to favor the bounce-pass over the quick slant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awful when `Mooch' plays the Packers,'' Izzo said,
``because a lot of old passions are dredged up for both of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there figures to be plenty of intensity at Lambeau Field
on Sunday afternoon in the premier NFL matchup of the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In each of the last three seasons, including twice at Lambeau,
the Packers dashed the 49ers' Super Bowl aspirations. Overall,
Green Bay has defeated San Francisco four times in a row and in six
of the last eight meetings. Given the offensive weaponry on both
sides and the dubious condition of the respective secondaries, this
game shapes up as a shootout.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to come down to which defense can break serve,''
Packers strong safety LeRoy Butler said.
</P>
<P>
   For Izzo, it's going to come down to a broken heart, no matter
the outcome. ``I can't win in this thing,'' he said. ``That's why I
hate it when they play.''
</P>
<P>
   The other ``bests'' in Week 9 of the schedule:
</P>
<P>
   _ Upset opportunity: In the season-opener, Washington backup
quarterback Trent Green came off the bench and nearly rallied the
Redskins over the New York Giants. This time around, Green is the
starter. And despite his 0-5 record in that role, Green will come
up big for coach Norv Turner. The Redskins, who can't stop the run,
get off the bagel, mostly because the Giants have no running game
to challenge them.
</P>
<P>
   _ Individual matchup: Philadelphia drafted cornerback Bobby
Taylor three years ago specifically to give them a physical
presence against Dallas wide receiver Michael Irvin. Despite
injuries, Taylor has played Irvin tough. Monday night should be no
different.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fantasy play: Denver tailback Terrell Davis, on his way to a
record-breaking season, vs. the porous rush defense of the
Cincinnati Bengals? If the NFL had the equivalent of softball's
10-run rule, this game might be stopped at halftime. Davis gets 150
and a long rest in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   _ Grudge match: The second time around, Seattle tailback Ricky
Watters vs. Oakland coach Jon Gruden already is passe. Still, the
third time around between Atlanta Falcons defensive coordinator
Rich Brooks and the St. Louis Rams outfit that fired him after only
two seasons remains a simmering feud. Brooks will rattle Rams
quarterback Tony Banks and go to 3-0 against his former employers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Division game: There's never any love lost when Miami and
Buffalo play. Little Doug Flutie adds some intrigue to this
long-time rivalry.

 &HT;    MacKay asks Parrotheads for their votes
 &HT;    By Shirish Date
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Democrat Buddy MacKay Thursday night
asked for votes from thousands of Parrotheads and for hundreds of
thousands of dollars from wealthy socialites.
</P>
<P>
   On both sides of the Intracoastal Waterway, MacKay got help from
far more famous friends: pop star Jimmy Buffett at a rally in West
Palm Beach, President Clinton at the state party's last fundraiser
prior to the election at the home of Slim-Fast tycoon F. Daniel
Abraham.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having Buffett out there for us was just marvelous,'' said
MacKay after he, his wife, Anne, Gov. Lawton Chiles, Sen. Bob
Graham and Treasurer Bill Nelson finished singing along with a
barefoot Buffett on a stage in front of the Palm Beach County
government center.
</P>
<P>
   The rally replayed, on a much larger scale, a similar appearance
MacKay had with Buffett a day earlier in Titusville. There, several
dozen Buffett fans waited politely through a brief news conference,
then mobbed Buffett with their record albums, posters and books
they had brought in hopes of an autograph.
</P>
<P>
   While Buffett on Thursday tried to rally his troops based on
what Republican Jeb Bush might do to Florida's environment, MacKay
and Chiles concentrated instead on lashing back against Bush's
continued attacks on MacKay's record on senior citizen issues. A
mailer last week mentioned legislation MacKay supported as a
congressman a decade ago to freeze Social Security benefits for a
year to help reduce the federal deficit.
</P>
<P>
   But a more recent Bush radio ad that warns elderly voters about
impending ``scare'' calls from MacKay on Thursday drew MacKay's
strongest ire. ``I think it's reprehensible,'' MacKay said. ``I
think Jeb Bush should apologize for running a scare campaign of his
own.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Clinton weighed in on the subject. In a short speech he
gave in front of Air Force One at the airport, Clinton said MacKay
has always been a staunch supporter of elderly issues. ``Goodness,
to see how anybody could say anything bad . . . is really a mystery
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's fund-raising visit, his second of the campaign, was
originally scheduled for early this month and was twice delayed,
first by the federal budget deadlock, then the Mideast peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay said such delays are to be expected when coordinating the
other commitments of the President of the United States. ``These
things are a function of people's very complicated scheduled,'' he
said. ``The fact it's happening is the important thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaign officials estimated the $5,000-a-plate dinner would
raise as much as $600,000 right before the deadline for collecting
money for Tuesday's election. Even that boost, however, will not
close the several-million-dollar gap between how much Bush and the
Republicans will spend and what MacKay and the Democrats will be
able to afford.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay plans to spend all day Friday in Dade County, attempting
to shore up elderly support in retirement condos _ a base of votes
Chiles used in 1994 to eke out a narrow win in his re-election.

 &HT;    1 small step from pool to the court
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Michael Lee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Herb and Dianne Shealy will be in Gainesville, Fla.,
today, getting their second dose of history in two days.
</P>
<P>
   The couple from Columbia, S.C., were a few hours south in Cape
Canaveral on Thursday to witness 77-year-old John Glenn's second
ascent into space, after 36 years. Today, they'll watch their
daughter, Courtney, attempt to do what no Georgia female athlete
ever has done: compete in two varsity sports on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's sort of like comparing apples with oranges. They're
in two different worlds,'' Dianne Shealy said. ``But they're both
really competitive and set out to accomplish their goals.''
</P>
<P>
   At 3 p.m., Courtney Shealy will try to help the second-ranked
Georgia swim team continue its dual-meet dominance against SEC
rival Florida. Four hours later, the starting middle blocker will
assist the volleyball team in an upset bid against the sixth-ranked
Lady Gators.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's an uncommon athlete,'' Georgia swimming coach Jack
Bauerle said. ``I don't think many people can do what she does.''
</P>
<P>
   On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, Shealy has swim practice
5:30- 7 a.m., lifts weights for an hour afterward, attends classes
for four hours, then has volleyball practice 3:30-6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Academic All-American's biggest worry this week was
finishing a 13-page paper Wednesday on the history of baseball.
Twisting her ankle Monday didn't even shake her up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no fear. Being tired never killed anyone,'' said
Shealy, whose ankle has healed. ``I'm just excited I have the
chance to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Both competitions will be in Stephen C. O'Connell Center on the
Florida campus, so Shealy won't need any transportation help.
</P>
<P>
   But Bauerle will do some manuevering to help the 6-foot-3 junior
conserve some energy. Shealy usually competes in four events, but
that number probably will be reduced to two or three, including the
400-yard medley relay, in which she helped Georgia set an SEC
record in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we don't need her for more,'' Bauerle said.
</P>
<P>
   Volleyball coach Jim Iams doesn't seem to mind either way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of all that she can accomplish and bring to Georgia
athletics,'' Iams said. ``It takes a lot of discipline to be
successful, and she does it with such ease.''
</P>
<P>
   Shealy, who was selected South Carolina swimmer of the year and
player of the year for volleyball after leading her high school
team to a state runner-up finish in 1996, competed only in swimming
her freshman year at Georgia. Since her arrival, the program is
undefeated in 20 dual meets and Georgia has claimed back-to-back
SEC titles.
</P>
<P>
   Last season was her first on the volleyball team. This year, she
has played in 10 matches and was promoted to starter when Kristine
Keese was injured a month ago. Before today, the two sports had not
competed on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   But it probably won't be the last time. On Nov. 14 in Athens,
the swim team has a dual meet against Texas and the volleyball team
has a match against South Carolina. And chances are that her
parents will be there again to witness the feat.
</P>
<P>
   Dianne Shealy said, ``It's going to be some accomplishment.''

 &HT;    A saint for all sinners
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ John Glenn has a patron saint: Joseph of
Cupertino, a 17th-century ``flying monk'' who levitated over the
altar of his Franciscan monastery _ often carrying fellow friars on
his back.
</P>
<P>
   Cupertino watches over pilots and astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   There is a patron saint for practically everyone and everything.
Their job is to represent their constituency before God and put in
a good word to the Most High.
</P>
<P>
   From the very early days of Christianity, the faithful have
adopted heroes of their faith to be their patron. They were
unofficial, very popular and almost without number.
</P>
<P>
   The feast of All Saints Day on Sunday remembers all of them _
known and unknown _ in what the catholic tradition calls the
communion of saints. The feast is also called All Hallows Day,
which is why the night before is called All Hallows Eve or
Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in heaven is considered a saint, according to the Rev.
James Wiseman, associate professor of theology at Catholic
University in Washington. But there is a special breed of saint who
demonstrates extraordinary sanctity and obedience to the faith.
Many, but not all, became patron saints.
</P>
<P>
   All the saints were once chosen by popular, local acclaim but
now are officially selected or canonized by the pope in the Roman
Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``A canonized saint is one officially recognized by the church
and therefore held up for our veneration,'' Wiseman said. ``The
saint is set forth as a model of what is meant to be a follower of
Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   The lore surrounding saints is ancient and modern, fascinating
and endless. Here's a potpourri of fact and fancy in honor of All
Saints Day.
</P>
<P>
   Patron saints look after people and places. They are assigned
illnesses (Lucy is the patron saint of dysentery and blindness),
vocations (Joseph of Arimathaea is the patron of pallbearers) and
problems (Expiditus is invoked against procrastination).
</P>
<P>
   Francis Xavier must be popular in Florida. He's the patron saint
of tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some strange patron saints:
</P>
<P>
   Patron saint of alcoholics: St. John of God. A 16th-century
Portuguese soldier of fortune, he heard a sermon and went mad. His
lunacy was considered a form of penance. He ran a hostel for the
sick and destitute. A hospital for alcoholics in Dublin is named
for him.
</P>
<P>
   The patron of the homeless is St. Benedict Joseph Labre. He was
a French Catholic in 1748 so eccentric that no monastery would have
him.
</P>
<P>
   So, he took a four-year-long walking tour of Europe's shrines.
He spent seven years living in the ruins of the colosseum in Rome.
When he died, the word passed through the streets of Rome, ``The
saint has died. The saint has died.''
</P>
<P>
   The patron saint of actresses was an exotic dancer from Antioch,
in ancient Syria, in the second or third century. St. Pelagia had a
racy act that a local bishop saw. No one knows _ or will admit _
what he was doing at the strip joint.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the bishop preached that Pelagia ``takes more
trouble over her beauty and her dancing than we do over our souls
and flocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelagia heard the sermon, confessed her sin, converted to the
faith and left for Jerusalem, where she lived in drag, dressed as a
man, until her death.
</P>
<P>
   To demonstrate that the ways of God are not the ways of man,
consider the patron saint of married women. A fourth-century saint
in North Africa, she was the mother of St. Augustine.
</P>
<P>
   Her name: Monica.
</P>
<P>
   Some helpful patron saints:
</P>
<P>
   For lost articles: St. Anthony of Padua
</P>
<P>
   For falsely accused: St. Raymond Nonnatus
</P>
<P>
   For desperate situations: St. Jude
</P>
<P>
   Against cancer: St. Peregrine
</P>
<P>
   (For Florida residents) to prevent lightning: St. Barbara
</P>
<P>
   Your own patron saint:
</P>
<P>
   Saints' Stories is a not-for-profit service that provides the
stories and legends of patron saints. It requests a donation of $1
or more for each story. Contact Saints' Stories at 520 Oliphant
Lane, Middletown, RI 02842-4600, or www.thombs.com/saints
</P>
<P>
   BIZARRE SAINTS
</P>
<P>
   Christina the Astonishing was a 13th-century Belgian lass who
died. At her funeral, she flew out of her coffin to land in the
rafters of the church. She was then tormented by an acute sense of
smell and, to escape the odor of people, perched on towers and
weather vanes and crawled into ovens and other remote places. She
is the patron saint of psychiatrists.
</P>
<P>
   Denis flourished in the first century as the first bishop of
Paris. He was beheaded one night in a tough part of the city,
picked up his head and walked 6 miles to the present site of the
cathedral that bears his name. He is the patron saint of France and
is invoked against headaches.
</P>
<P>
   St. Maria Goretti, the patron of teenage girls, saved her
persecutor. The young Italian girl was assaulted by a neighbor,
Alexander Sernelli, when she was 12 in 1902. She resisted his
advances, but he killed her.
</P>
<P>
   Maria came to him in a vision in prison and forgave him. When
she was canonized in 1950, Sernelli, by then a monk, attended the
service _ the first time a saint's murderer had done so.
</P>
<P>
   hOW DO YOU GET TO BE A SAINT?
</P>
<P>
   The process often takes 100 years or more. But it always begins
with a local bishop who nominates a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters, who become part of what is called the cult of the
saint, promote his or her candidacy. An in-depth examination of the
candidate's life follows.
</P>
<P>
   The first step is to be named venerable. The candidate is then
beatified or given the title ``blessed'' in an impressive ceremony
that is just shy of sainthood. Generally, the Vatican must prove
that a miracle happened as a result of prayer to the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Another miracle is needed to take the final step to sainthood.
But the pope can waive any requirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``A canonized saint is one officially recognized by the church
and therefore held up for our veneration,'' says James Wiseman,
associate professor of theology at Catholic University in
Washington. ``The saint is set forth as a model of what is meant to
be a follower of Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   Who makes a saint?
</P>
<P>
   The first saints were martyrs. Early saints were chosen by
popular acclaim. Most were locally honored. The process grew out of
control.
</P>
<P>
   By the 12th century, the pope reserved naming saints to the
Vatican. In 1588, Pope Sixtus V created the Sacred Congregation of
Rites to deal with worship and saints. In 1969, the committee for
saints was subdivided and renamed the Congregation for the Cause of
Saints. How many saints are there?
</P>
<P>
   No one knows. Conservative estimates suggest more than 3,000.
Pope John Paul II has named more than 275 saints in his 20-year
tenure, more than any of his predecessors. He has beatified more
than 750 others who are in line to become saints.
</P>
<P>
   Do people worship saints?
</P>
<P>
   No. Only God is worshiped. But the faithful may honor saints
with statues and prayer. The faithful often ask saints to intercede
or put in a good word with God for them.
</P>
<P>
   WHO WAS THE FIRST SAINT?
</P>
<P>
   Probably St. Stephen, the first martyr.
</P>
<P>
   Or St. John the Baptist, who was not a Christian but is a saint
and preceded Stephen.
</P>
<P>
   Or St. Isaiah, St. Jeremiah, St. Daniel or other Hebrew Bible
holy men the church in some ages has called saints.
</P>
<P>
   SAINTS-IN-WAITING
</P>
<P>
   No one knows who might be a saint. Hundreds of beatified
worthies are in line to be canonized. Here are a few sure bets for
future sainthood:
</P>
<P>
   _ Mother Teresa, who cared for the poorest of the poor in
Calcutta, India, died in 1997. The process cannot begin until five
years after her death, but handicappers say she is a shoo-in.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pope John Paul II, considered a likely candidate. Pope John
XXIII may be considered, and Pius XII is on the list.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dorothy Day, founder of the Catholic Worker Movement in New
York City, who died in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   _ Louis and Veli Martin, who raised their daughters, the little
flower, St. Teresa and four others, to became nuns. ``The pope has
been looking to beatify a couple,'' said Madeline Nugent, founder
of Saints Stories in Rhode Island. ``He wants to beatify lay
people, particularly a married couple.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Mother Guerin, who will be beatified Sunday in Rome. She
founded the Sisters of Providence of St. Mary-of-the-Woods near
Terre Haute, Ind., in 1840. Her cause began in 1909.
</P>
<P>
   _ Padre Pio, an Italian priest who died in 1968. He was known
for working with the poor, bearing on his hands the stigmata (the
wounds of Christ) and bi-location, the ability to be in two places
at once.
</P>
<P>
   CONTROVERSIAL SAINTS
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is happy when the pope names a saint:
</P>
<P>
   _ Edith Stein was a Jewish woman who converted to the church and
was killed in the Holocaust in 1942. She was canonized this fall.
Some claim she was martyred because she was Jewish, not because of
her faith as a Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pope Pius XII is on the fast track to be canonized. Some call
him the silent pope of World War II. For some reason, he never
publicly condemned the slaughter of Jews in the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   _ Alotzije Stepinac, a Croatian cardinal of the Roman Catholic
Church, was recently beatified. Some Serbs and Jews see him as a
symbol of the Croatian church's cooperation with Nazi Germany.
</P>
<P>
   _ Blessed Mary of the Cross Mackillop was beatified in 1995 in
Australia. She wanted to run her order of Josephites free of the
dominance of the local bishop. He excommunicated her. That was
rescinded, but resentment remains.
</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN SAINTS
</P>
<P>
   _ St. Frances Xavier Cabrini is the first American saint. She
was born in Italy, came to this country in 1889 to help Italian
immigrants and started schools, hospitals and orphanages. She was
canonized in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   _ St. Elizabeth Ann Seton, who died in 1821, is the first
native-born American saint. Born in New York in 1775, she started
America's first free Catholic school in Maryland and was made a
saint in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   _ Blessed Kateri Tekakwitha is the first Native American to be
beatified, in 1980. She is not yet a saint. She was born in 1656 in
New York, the daughter of a Mohawk warrior. She was baptized in
1676 against the wish of her tribe. She lived with a community of
Christian Indians in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   _ St. John Neumann is the first male American saint. Born in
Bohemia in 1811, Neumann came to New York as one of 36 priests for
200,000 Roman Catholics. He became the bishop of Philadelphia and
organized a diocesan Catholic school system. He was declared a
saint in 1977.
</P>
<P>

EX-HOTELIER WITH FORMER TIES TO A CRIME FAMILY DISAPPEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By SELWYN RAAB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Edward J. Halloran, whose business empire collapsed
after he was accused of working with the Mafia to fix concrete
prices on multimillion-dollar projects in Manhattan, vanished two
months ago while on a visit to the city, the authorities disclosed
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Halloran's relatives and friends said they doubted that the
disappearance was linked to his racketeering conviction in 1987 or
to his former ties to mob leaders in the Genovese crime family.
They said that he had not been heard from since late August, when
he said he planned to drive from Manhattan to his current home in
Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   But state and federal investigators said they were looking into
the possibility that the mystery of his whereabouts is related to
organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   An investigator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said
that city and federal agencies believe that Halloran, 57, may have
quarreled with a reputed mobster in New York shortly before he
dropped out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an active investigation, and we are following up on
several leads,'' said Lt. Sean Crowley, a spokesman for the New
York City Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s and early 1980s, as the owner of the Halloran
House Hotel on Lexington Avenue and 49th Street and as the operator
of Manhattan's only two concrete plants, Halloran was a rising star
in New York's business world.
</P>
<P>
   Called Biff by his friends, he cut a dashing figure, and was
celebrated as a party giver and as a lavish spender.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before his legal troubles exploded, Biff led an elegant
lifestyle,'' said a lawyer who represented Halloran and spoke on
the condition that he not be identified. ``In those days, the cream
of cafe society was at his feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a barrage of criminal indictments, his business ventures
crumbled into bankruptcy in the mid-1980s. The state attorney
general's office also filed an antitrust suit, charging that
Halloran had organized a monopoly to inflate concrete prices
through his two companies, the Certified Concrete Co. and the
Transit Mix Co.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the companies generated more than $300 million a year
in sales.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Halloran was sentenced to six months in prison on
Rikers Island on state charges involving a check-kiting scheme.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, along with two major figures in the Genovese crime
family, Anthony Salerno and Matthew Ianniello, he was convicted on
federal racketeering, bid-rigging and extortion accusations and
sentenced to 13 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biff Halloran, ladies and gentlemen, the government submits,
was a full associate of the Genovese family,'' Mark Hellerer, a
federal prosecutor said in his summation at Halloran's trial.
</P>
<P>
   After serving four years in prison, Halloran was released in
1991 during an appeal for a new trial. In a plea-bargaining deal,
Halloran dropped his appeal, pleaded guilty to reduced racketeering
charges and was sentenced to the time he had already served.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Before his conviction, Halloran lived in Pelham Manor in
Westchester County with his first wife, Carol, and their two
children, Holly and Eric. After his release, he moved to Fort
Lauderdale with his second wife, Michele.
</P>
<P>
   According to court records in Broward County, Fla., the Internal
Revenue Service, since 1995, has filed tax liens totaling more than
$14 million against Halloran for income tax arrears. Halloran's
relatives declined to say what his business interests were in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Halloran's brother, Richard Halloran, said in a telephone
interview that he had reported the disappearance to the FBI and to
the state police, who then alerted the city's Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were concerned that he might have been in an accident
driving back to Florida,'' Richard Halloran, a construction company
executive in Balacynwyd, Pa., near Philadelphia, said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of the Halloran family, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said that Edward Halloran's daughter, Holly, who lives
on the East Side of Manhattan, is believed to have been the last
known person to speak to him or see him in late August. Ms.
Halloran declined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of his problems, he is not the type to fall off the
radar screen,'' the friend said of Halloran. ``It is totally
uncharacteristic of him.''

SAILER IMPROVED AFTER KICKING WORKOUT   (CORRECTS BYLINE SPELLING)
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA kicker Chris Sailer did something Wednesday
he had not done in four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He kicked.
</P>
<P>
   And that _ not his 45-yard extra point at Cal _ is the best
indication of Sailer's recovery from a strained groin suffered
Sept. 30 in a post-practice kicking exhibition for television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling really good, actually,'' said Sailer, a senior
from Notre Dame High. ``I can't guarantee I'll ever be 100 percent
because of the wear and tear of games. But it's getting better. I'm
a good 80-to-85 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   When Sailer missed a 21-yard field goal two weeks ago against
Oregon _ he later made the game-winner from 24 yards in overtime _
his right leg was hovering near 50 percent. He walked with a limp
and kicked with a cringe.
</P>
<P>
   Daily treatment and plenty of rest have fueled his speedy
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the Oregon game to the Cal game, it felt twice as good,''
he said. ``Obviously, it's not perfect yet, but it got a lot better
in a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Sailer erased any doubts by drilling three penalty-propelled
extra points (from 35, 40 and 45 yards) in the first quarter at
Cal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like pregame warmups, when the kicks are five yards
here and five yards there,'' he said. ``They weren't my normal
kicks, but I'm getting it back slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   __ No nickel?: Sophomore Marques Anderson responded well to his
demotion from starting cornerback to nickel back (a third
cornerback used in passing situations). Anderson made five tackles
and broke up three passes against Cal, and he was named UCLA's
special-teams player of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Now, how will he respond to a sprained big toe on his right
foot?
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is questionable for Stanford, which has attempted more
passes than any team in the Pac-10. If he can't play, junior Eric
Whitfield becomes the nickel back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's better, but he hasn't practiced all week,'' coach Bob
Toledo said of Anderson. ``It's a 3:30 game, so we have all day
Friday and all Saturday morning for treatment. But we can't count
on him right now.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Ready, set, wait: Freshman tailback DeShaun Foster practiced
this week and moved well on his sprained left knee. He's available,
but the Bruins probably won't use him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plan is not to play him unless we get injuries to a bunch
of tailbacks and we don't have anybody to play,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Jermaine Lewis will start, with Keith Brown and walk-on Mark
Reynosa in reserve.
</P>
<P>
   __ Pep talk: Toledo spoke to freshman cornerback Julius Williams
earlier this week about his tentative play. Williams responded with
his best practice of the season Wednesday despite a sore back.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be afraid to make mistakes and I think he's
realizing that,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is UCLA's fifth cornerback, behind Jason Bell, Ryan
Roques, Eric Whitfield and Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury update: Despite a slew of aches and pains, only two
regulars won't play: Foster and oft-injured linebacker Michael
Wiley.
</P>
<P>
   __ Short stuff: The first 10,000 fans entering on the Rose
Bowl's east side will receive a Cade McNown fan mask.... Between
the first and second quarters, UCLA will honor Dr. Louis J.
Ignarro, who won the Nobel Prize for medicine.... Defensive line
coach Terry Tumey turned 33 on Thursday. Yes, it's been 12 years
since Tumey, a nose guard, was named All-Pac-10 for the third (and
final) time.... A crowd in excess of 60,000 is expected, so arrive
early in the congested Arroyo. As usual, shuttle service is
available from the Parsons Engineering Building in Pasadena to the
Rose Bowl.

COMMENTARY: DID YOU REALLY THINK HE WOULD BE MR. MANNERS? 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ George Jessel, a name not likely to ring many Gen-X
bells, was an old-time vaudevillian who performed at so many
banquets and fund-raisers that he became known as ``toastmaster
general of the United States.'' He enjoyed a special niche with
older, conservative Jews.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, a year before he died at 83, he agreed to tour Jewish
precincts of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, with a conservative candidate
named Alfonse D'Amato, soon to become famous as ``Senator Pothole''
but at the time not a household name west of Great Neck.
</P>
<P>
   After their joint appearance, D'Amato quickly forgot who was
doing a favor for whom. While Jessel sat alone in the back of a
car, the candidate stood outside and rasped to an aide: ``We can't
carry George around all day. How do we get him out of here?''
</P>
<P>
   You could tell he was going to be a class act. He has since
rarely disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   By now, the D'Amato encyclopedia of embarrassments is as thick
as a pillar: his ``Old MacDonald'' routine on the Senate floor, his
crude mocking of Judge Lance Ito, his recent use of a Yiddish
vulgarism, his coarse reference to an overweight congressman. On
and on.
</P>
<P>
   Most intriguing of all was his choked-up response to being
called a fascist in the 1992 campaign. D'Amato had reason to be
offended. But a free lesson at the Stella Adler Conservatory of
Acting is offered here to anyone who took the senator's weepy
performance at face value.
</P>
<P>
   The quivering lower lip was a particularly nice touch. It gave
him a secure place in the pantheon of the Politics of Blubbering, a
school of campaigning that has had a healthy revival in this
election season, which ends, mercifully, in four days.
</P>
<P>
   Just about everybody seems to have found reason to take offense
over one remark or another, from D'Amato's epithet in somewhat
mangled Yiddish to Attorney General Dennis Vacco's reported
jabbering about bandidos outside bodegas.
</P>
<P>
   Each gaffe, naturally, produced cries over how the insult was
intolerable to this or that ethnic group, which had already
suffered so much for so long. Only in a New York political campaign
does an argument over a Yiddish crudity somehow wind up in the same
sentence as the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Even the macho mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, has been unable to
resist a little blubbering. Witness how he carried on after Eliot
Spitzer, the Democratic candidate for attorney general, referred in
the same breath to the Giuliani City Hall and Girolamo Savonarola,
the uncompromising ascetic friar of 15th-century Florence. An
outrageous anti-Italian insult, the mayor fumed.
</P>
<P>
   What anti-Italian? There was no Italy until the 1860s (a
unification of fractious states that prompted the statesman Massimo
D'Azeglio to observe, ``We have made Italy; now we must make
Italians''). At worst, maybe you can say Spitzer revealed an
anti-Florentine streak. But who needs one more news conference for
a denial of bigotry?
</P>
<P>
   Now what? Does calling an opponent Machiavellian also make you
anti-Italian? Labeling someone a quisling proves you don't like
Norwegians? How about Luddite? Uh-uh. Anti-English. If you think
this is becoming faintly Kafkaesque, prepare to apologize to the
Czechs.
</P>
<P>
   Getting back to D'Amato, his loose lips and forays into the
Politics of Blubbering have led many commentators to pine over the
last 18 years for a senator with more class. New Yorkers, one often
hears, deserve better.
</P>
<P>
   You would think this state were filled only with gentle souls
who spend dawn to dusk pondering civic virtue. Those people exist,
of course. And one could argue that they have their
philosopher-Solon in Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a politician who
likes to act as if he were above it all.
</P>
<P>
   But New York, when last examined, is the state that also
produced those national symbols of high purpose and grace John
McEnroe and Joey Buttafuoco. This is a city where people endlessly
shout obscenities on the street, clip fingernails on buses and drip
greasy sandwiches on those next to them on the subway.
</P>
<P>
   Don't those people deserve a senator, too? Can they do better
than ``Senator E-I-E-I-O,'' with his flair for eye-popping
crudeness?
</P>
<P>
   Besides, D'Amato can also claim, and often does, that he is a
crackerjack at bringing home the bacon. On second thought, that is
one boast he may want to reconsider. It sounds awfully close to a
slur against Jews and Muslims.

HOMEWORK HELPS ELLIS' GRADES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Cowboys rookie defensive end Greg Ellis said he
has learned more about football the past seven months than he did
in four years of college.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis has bulked up his football IQ by spending time studying
game film and even doing extra homework. At the suggestion of
defensive ends coach Jim Jeffcoast, Ellis has created a home video
library of his games and the offensive linemen he has faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was coach Jeffcoat's idea and it makes a lot of sense,''
said Ellis who has used his knowledge the past month to record all
of his 2.5 sacks and many of his 31 tackles that lead all Cowboys
defensive linemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFL is not like college, where you play against a guy
three or four years and that's it. Here you play against the same
guy sometimes for 10 years. So you can learn what they do and study
them in the off-season.''
</P>
<P>
   One tape Ellis doesn't have in his library is the one
Philadelphia Eagles coach Ray Rhodes showed to the Philadelphia
media on NFL draft day last April. That tape highlighted offensive
tackle Tra Thomas, the Eagles' first-round pick from Florida State,
getting the best of a North Carolina player, whom the Cowboys
selected with the eighth pick in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   The replay of this matchup comes Monday night at Veterans
Stadium in Philadelphia, when Ellis and Thomas are scheduled to
face each other. Ellis said this game is not about revenge, but
rather about two rookies in the first of what may be many meetings
to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tra and I are a perfect example for the purpose of my
library,'' Ellis said. ``Everybody says we should have promising
careers. I want to keep film on him and see the things he does so I
can work on them and learn from them. We are going to play against
each other for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis says now that he even understands the Eagles' draft-day
motive. He called the actions ``lowdown'' and ``dirty'' last April
and even wondered aloud ``what did I do to the Eagles.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he laughed off the incident in the Cowboys' locker room
recently while recalling that he had five tackles and a few hits on
the quarterback when North Carolina played Florida State last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Rhodes was just highlighting his player,'' Ellis said.
``He didn't mean anything by it. He was just showing Tra Thomas is
a good player. When you look at in a positive way, it was a
compliment because he was saying Greg Ellis is a good player and he
can block Greg Ellis.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he started slow with 10 tackles and no sacks in the first
three games, Ellis' current statistics project to 70 tackles for
the season, which would be more than veteran tackles Leon Lett and
Chad Hennings have had in any one year.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis was the first Cowboys rookie defensive end to start a
season opener since Bob Lilly, later an All-Pro tackle, in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bust stuff bothered me at first,'' Ellis said. ``But I'm
over that. I'm out there making plays and tackles. I don't make
every play, but I'm holding my own. And leading the line in tackles
is proof that I'm not a bust. I don't see how anybody can call me a
bust.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes certainly isn't. When asked whether he thought Thomas was
going to dominate Ellis on Monday night as he did on the film clip,
Rhodes quickly retreated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't say that,'' Rhodes said. ``Greg is playing extremely
well. He is a good football player. He was a good football player
when the Cowboys drafted him. To come in and play right away, he's
done a good job for the football team.''
</P>
<P>
   And while the game with the Eagles has put the spotlight on
Ellis and Thomas, Ellis said he prefers to measure himself against
the other rookie defensive ends drafted in the first round _ Andre
Wadsworth, picked third by the Cardinals; Grant Wistrom, picked
sixth by the Rams; and Vonnie Holliday, picked 19th by the Packers.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis' stats compare well. Wadsworth has 36 tackles and five
sacks. Holliday has 32 tackles and five sacks. And Wistrom, the
only one that doesn't start, has 12 tackles and one sack in limited
playing time. ``It's important to me to look at them because we are
all so close together,'' Ellis said. ``We all know each other. I'm
a competitive guy. So I try to keep up with them to compare stats
at the end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffcoat, who says Ellis has proved to be a good run stopper and
is gaining confidence as a pass rusher, predicts Ellis is going to
get better as the year goes on.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done incredibly well,'' Jeffcoat said. ``He's like a
baby. Everything is new to him, and he adjusts and keeps getting
better and better. He's such a talented athlete and has the right
attitude. I see some big things out of him in the second part of
this year and the future.'' Briefly Defensive end Kavika Pittman
missed practice yesterday after spraining his right ankle
Wednesday. He is listed as probable for the Eagles game.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said he won't call any naked bootlegs,
but was not going to change the offense to protect quarterback Troy
Aikman's fractured collarbone.

HORSE SENSE WOULD REJECT SQUAW CREEK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When shuttered Trinity Meadows racetrack in Willow Park, Texas,
west of Fort Worth, became available for purchase last summer, Lone
Star Park at Grand Prairie officials saw an open door.
</P>
<P>
   The only sure way to protect Lone Star from future competition
from Trinity Meadows, they realized, was to buy the Class 2 track
and convert it from a gambling establishment into a boarding and
training center for racehorses.
</P>
<P>
   They set out to do just that, bidding to acquire the track at a
bankruptcy auction in a basement room at the U.S. courthouse in
Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Lone Star president Bob Kaminski had consulted with track
investors and determined that a bid of $2 million on Trinity
Meadows would be feasible. But when the auction began, Kaminski was
stuck in midair between New York and Dallas on a flight that had
been delayed. He improvised by using an airplane telephone to
contact other track officials who had brought a cellular phone to
the courthouse. Only Kaminski could authorize a higher bid, if
necessary, and having a telephone was the next best thing to being
there.
</P>
<P>
   However, as bidding was under way, the phone connection was lost
and could not be re-established.
</P>
<P>
   Once Kaminski got back in touch with his managers, it was too
late: Trinity Meadows had been acquired by a group of Fort Worth
area businessmen for a bid of $2.175 million, topping Lone Star's
final bid of $1.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   That missed opportunity becomes relevant next week. The new
owners of the small track _ renamed Squaw Creek Downs _ are going
before two administrative law judges in Austin as a first step in
seeking a Texas Racing Commission license to reopen the track for
live racing and simulcasting.
</P>
<P>
   If the license is granted, Squaw Creek Downs will be in
competition with Lone Star, its glitzy $96 million neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Any live racing at Squaw Creek _ which would be predominantly
quarter horses but would include thoroughbreds, Arabians,
appaloosas and paints _ would be so minor-league as to be
inconsequential to Lone Star. It also would almost certainly be a
money-losing venture.
</P>
<P>
   But the concern at Lone Star is that Squaw Creek also would be
taking bets on races from New York, California, Kentucky, Arkansas
and Louisiana tracks _ the bread-and-butter of Lone Star's
lucrative simulcast business.
</P>
<P>
   A long-standing axiom in the racing industry holds that a bettor
will seldom drive past one track to attend another. Some
horseplayers west of Fort Worth could be expected to sacrifice
luxury for convenience, and bet on simulcast races at Squaw Creek
instead of Lone Star.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their live racing can't compete with our live racing,''
Kaminski says. ``But their TV sets can compete with our TV sets.''
</P>
<P>
   A decrease in simulcast revenue at Lone Star could translate
into a cut in live-racing purses. And that would undermine the
state's only successful track in its bid to attract quality
stables.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Lone Star is bitterly opposed to Squaw Creek's
license application. The boards of the Texas Thoroughbred
Association and the Texas Quarter Horse Association also have taken
a stand against it.
</P>
<P>
   Squaw Creek's owners are expected to argue that some Texas-bred
horses are too slow to compete at Lone Star and need a small track
of their own, closer to home than Retama Park, Sam Houston or Manor
Downs. But Lone Star offers a multitude of Texas-bred races, some
of which are such easy pickings that horses need only be marginally
ambulatory to earn money.
</P>
<P>
   Squaw Creek has another, more convincing, argument _ that
horseplayers west of Fort Worth shouldn't have to battle I-30
traffic all the way into Grand Prairie.
</P>
<P>
   However, the solution isn't to build a track in every county.
The Texas racing industry should instead propose legislation to
legalize telephone wagering in preparation for the national racing
channel that will be launched on cable TV sometime next year. When
that day comes, a Weatherford horseplayer won't need to fire up the
pickup truck at all. Betting on races from Lone Star and elsewhere
could be done from an easy chair at home, and neighbors would be
unsuspecting.
</P>
<P>
   Common sense says Squaw Creek's license bid should be a huge
long shot.
</P>
<P>
   Lone Star has become a respected racing power, and the former
Trinity Meadows has a long-standing record as a national
embarrassment. Furthermore, Texas needs another financially shaky
Class 2 track about as much as it needs more fire ants.
</P>
<P>
   But next week's hearings aren't about common sense. They are
guided by administrative law, where common sense can take a back
seat to jurisprudence.
</P>
<P>
   That is what happened six years ago, when Dudley McCalla, by all
accounts a brilliant legal scholar, made a recommendation that will
forever live in Texas racing infamy. Using the required points of
law rather than common horse sense, McCalla determined that Trinity
Meadows deserved the Class 1 racing license for North Texas instead
of Lone Star or its rival Midpointe Racing.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, 1992's racing commissioners ignored that legal
recommendation and awarded Lone Star the license.
</P>
<P>
   And if the hearing examiners at next week's sessions choose to
recommend Squaw Creek for a license, let's hope 1998's commission
also will see fit to apply the rules of common sense and just say
no. \N:tagtop:Randy Moss (972) 237-4845
\N:tagbottom:randymoss\Nstar-telegram.com
Lame strategy
</P>
<P>
   Lone Star attorneys apparently will hit hard next week at Squaw
Creek Downs principal owner James Dunnagan's lack of experience
with horses and horse racing.
</P>
<P>
   Dunnagan, an Arlington resident who manufactures refrigerator
displays for supermarkets, bought 50 percent of Squaw Creek last
year as an investment. Grilled by a Lone Star attorney in an Oct.
15 deposition, Dunnagan admitted he has visited four racetracks,
one time each.
</P>
<P>
   But that lack of racing savvy shouldn't be a primary issue in
the license controversy. After all, Lone Star was built on the
financial shoulders of real estate tycoons Trammel and Harlan Crow,
who didn't have horse manure on their cowboy boots, either.
Expensive choice
Gentlemen's trainer, Richard Mandella, reports that the odds are
50-50 on the 6-year-old running in the Nov. 7 Breeders' Cup
Classic. He was also pre-entered in the Breeders' Cup Mile.
</P>
<P>
   If Gentlemen runs in the Classic, an $800,000 supplemental
nomination fee must be paid by his owners, which include former
mayor Robert Folsom of Dallas. That would be a record, surpassing
the $480,000 paid to get Skip Away into last year's Classic, which
he won.
</P>
<P>
   The payment was made for Skip Away only because of a rule
enacted last year by the Breeders' Cup making a supplemental
payment good for a horse's entire career. Silver Charm's owners,
Bob and Beverly Lewis, are paying $480,000 to get him into the
Classic, but plan to run him next year as a 5-year-old and possibly
at age 6.
</P>
<P>
   But Gentlemen will make his final start in the Breeders' Cup
before going to stud, which makes an $800,000 payment tough to
justify.
Bettors' bargain
</P>
<P>
   A request by Breeders' Cup officials to run every horse as an
uncoupled betting interest _ regardless of common ownership _ was
rejected by the Kentucky State Racing Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Awesome Again, Touch Gold and Coronado's Quest will therefore
run as a powerful three-horse betting entry in the Classic, and
trainer D. Wayne Lukas will have three-horse and two-horse betting
entries in the Juvenile.
</P>
<P>
   Houston owners Robert and Janice McNair own a portion of both
Touch Gold and Coronado's Quest, and according to Kentucky rules,
those horses must be coupled in wagering. Because Canadian
industrialist Frank Stronach owns all of Awesome Again and the
other part of Touch Gold, those two horses much be coupled as well.
Thus, all three horses must race as one for betting purposes.
Et cetera
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm and Skip Away continue to burn up the track in
morning workouts, indicating that both grays will be sharp for the
Classic... CBS News' ``Sunday Morning'' will profile trainer Sonny
Hine and his wife, Carolyn, who owns Skip Away... If both Silver
Charm and Gentlemen are supplemented into the Classic, the
resulting purse of $5.12 million will be the largest ever for a
horse race... Four previous winners of Breeders' Cup races are
returning: Skip Away; 1997 Juvenile winner Favorite Trick, who goes
this year in the Mile on grass; Chief Bearhart, who returns to
defend his Turf title; and Da Hoss, the Texas-owned horse who won
the Mile in 1996 and now will try again. ... Memories of Silver
pulled a ligament in a Wednesday workout and the 5-year-old mare is
out of the Breeders' Cup Mile... Pat Day will ride Awesome Again in
the Classic, with Chris McCarron getting the mount on Touch Gold.
But Day didn't get his choice. ``Pat was having trouble making up
his mind,'' said Patrick Byrne, who trains both horses. ``So I made
it for him'' ... Day also rides for Byrne in the Sprint, aboard
Wild Rush.

taking bets on races from New York, California, Kentucky, Arkansas
and Louisiana tracks _ the bread-and-butter of Lone Star's
lucrative simulcast business.
</P>
<P>
   A long-standing axiom in the racing industry holds that a bettor
will seldom drive past one track to attend another. Some
horseplayers west of Fort Worth could be expected to sacrifice
luxury for convenience, and bet on simulcast races at Squaw Creek
instead of Lone Star.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their live racing can't compete with our live racing,''
Kaminski says. ``But their TV sets can compete with our TV sets.''
</P>
<P>
   A decrease in simulcast revenue at Lone Star could translate
into a cut in live-racing purses. And that would undermine the
state's only successful track in its bid to attract quality
stables.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Lone Star is bitterly opposed to Squaw Creek's
license application. The boards of the Texas Thoroughbred
Association and the Texas Quarter Horse Association also have taken
a stand against it.
</P>
<P>
   Squaw Creek's owners are expected to argue that some Texas-bred
horses are too slow to compete at Lone Star and need a small track
of their own, closer to home than Retama Park, Sam Houston or Manor
Downs. But Lone Star offers a multitude of Texas-bred races, some
of which are such easy pickings that horses need only be marginally
ambulatory to earn money.
</P>
<P>
   Squaw Creek has another, more convincing, argument _ that
horseplayers west of Fort Worth shouldn't have to battle I-30
traffic all the way into Grand Prairie.
</P>
<P>
   However, the solution isn't to build a track in every county.
The Texas racing industry should instead propose legislation to
legalize telephone wagering in preparation for the national racing
channel that will be launched on cable TV sometime next year. When
that day comes, a Weatherford horseplayer won't need to fire up the
pickup truck at all. Betting on races from Lone Star and elsewhere
could be done from an easy chair at home, and neighbors would be
unsuspecting.
</P>
<P>
   Common sense says Squaw Creek's license bid should be a huge
long shot.
</P>
<P>
   Lone Star has become a respected racing power, and the former
Trinity Meadows has a long-standing record as a national
embarrassment. Furthermore, Texas needs another financially shaky
Class 2 track about as much as it needs more fire ants.
</P>
<P>
   But next week's hearings aren't about common sense. They are
guided by administrative law, where common sense can take a back
seat to jurisprudence.
</P>
<P>
   That is what happened six years ago, when Dudley McCalla, by all
accounts a brilliant legal scholar, made a recommendation that will
forever live in Texas racing infamy. Using the required points of
law rather than common horse sense, McCalla determined that Trinity
Meadows deserved the Class 1 racing license for North Texas instead
of Lone Star or its rival Midpointe Racing.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, 1992's racing commissioners ignored that legal
recommendation and awarded Lone Star the license.
</P>
<P>
   And if the hearing examiners at next week's sessions choose to
recommend Squaw Creek for a license, let's hope 1998's commission
also will see fit to apply the rules of common sense and just say
no. \N:tagtop:Randy Moss (972) 237-4845

Lame strategy
</P>
<P>
   Lone Star attorneys apparently will hit hard next week at Squaw
Creek Downs principal owner James Dunnagan's lack of experience
with horses and horse racing.
</P>
<P>
   Dunnagan, an Arlington resident who manufactures refrigerator
displays for supermarkets, bought 50 percent of Squaw Creek last
year as an investment. Grilled by a Lone Star attorney in an Oct.
15 deposition, Dunnagan admitted he has visited four racetracks,
one time each.
</P>
<P>
   But that lack of racing savvy shouldn't be a primary issue in
the license controversy. After all, Lone Star was built on the
financial shoulders of real estate tycoons Trammel and Harlan Crow,
who didn't have horse manure on their cowboy boots, either.
Expensive choice
Gentlemen's trainer, Richard Mandella, reports that the odds are
50-50 on the 6-year-old running in the Nov. 7 Breeders' Cup
Classic. He was also pre-entered in the Breeders' Cup Mile.
</P>
<P>
   If Gentlemen runs in the Classic, an $800,000 supplemental
nomination fee must be paid by his owners, which include former
mayor Robert Folsom of Dallas. That would be a record, surpassing
the $480,000 paid to get Skip Away into last year's Classic, which
he won.
</P>
<P>
   The payment was made for Skip Away only because of a rule
enacted last year by the Breeders' Cup making a supplemental
payment good for a horse's entire career. Silver Charm's owners,
Bob and Beverly Lewis, are paying $480,000 to get him into the
Classic, but plan to run him next year as a 5-year-old and possibly
at age 6.
</P>
<P>
   But Gentlemen will make his final start in the Breeders' Cup
before going to stud, which makes an $800,000 payment tough to
justify.
Bettors' bargain
</P>
<P>
   A request by Breeders' Cup officials to run every horse as an
uncoupled betting interest _ regardless of common ownership _ was
rejected by the Kentucky State Racing Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Awesome Again, Touch Gold and Coronado's Quest will therefore
run as a powerful three-horse betting entry in the Classic, and
trainer D. Wayne Lukas will have three-horse and two-horse betting
entries in the Juvenile.
</P>
<P>
   Houston owners Robert and Janice McNair own a portion of both
Touch Gold and Coronado's Quest, and according to Kentucky rules,
those horses must be coupled in wagering. Because Canadian
industrialist Frank Stronach owns all of Awesome Again and the
other part of Touch Gold, those two horses much be coupled as well.
Thus, all three horses must race as one for betting purposes.
Et cetera
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm and Skip Away continue to burn up the track in
morning workouts, indicating that both grays will be sharp for the
Classic... CBS News' ``Sunday Morning'' will profile trainer Sonny
Hine and his wife, Carolyn, who owns Skip Away... If both Silver
Charm and Gentlemen are supplemented into the Classic, the
resulting purse of $5.12 million will be the largest ever for a
horse race... Four previous winners of Breeders' Cup races are
returning: Skip Away; 1997 Juvenile winner Favorite Trick, who goes
this year in the Mile on grass; Chief Bearhart, who returns to
defend his Turf title; and Da Hoss, the Texas-owned horse who won
the Mile in 1996 and now will try again. ... Memories of Silver
pulled a ligament in a Wednesday workout and the 5-year-old mare is
out of the Breeders' Cup Mile... Pat Day will ride Awesome Again in
the Classic, with Chris McCarron getting the mount on Touch Gold.
But Day didn't get his choice. ``Pat was having trouble making up
his mind,'' said Patrick Byrne, who trains both horses. ``So I made
it for him'' ... Day also rides for Byrne in the Sprint, aboard
Wild Rush.

ZENIA MUCHA, A D'AMATO PUPIL, IS PATAKI'S `COMMITTEE OF ONE' 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHESTER, N.Y. _ When Zenia Mucha had 10 minutes to spare before
Gov. George Pataki arrived in this Orange County village for a
campaign stop the other day, she did what any confident manager of
an incumbent who is some 30 points ahead in the polls would do: She
went antiquing. And then she did something only a very powerful
campaign manager would do: She continued shopping, even after she
knew her boss had arrived. Quickly, she bought a copper lamp for
$65 and two occasional tables for $95, then hurried over to the bar
where the governor was shaking hands to show him her treasures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, I love that,'' Pataki said, stopping his handshaking to
admire Ms. Mucha's lamp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cool?'' she asked, pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we head off to Kingston,'' said Pataki, who often
antiques with Ms. Mucha, ``you've got to sneak me in.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, on the way to Ulster County, Pataki sat in the back seat
of his car with Ms. Mucha and recalled the first time he met her.
It was 1982, when he was running for mayor of Peekskill, and Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., had come by for a ribbon cutting.
Afterward, as Pataki remembers it, D'Amato ordered Pataki into his
car for a ride to Dutchess County. Inside the car was Ms. Mucha, at
that time one of D'Amato's press aides. ``And just as he was giving
me orders,'' Pataki said, laughing at Ms. Mucha, ``you were giving
him orders.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mucha responded by playfully slapping the governor's knee.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly four years, Ms. Mucha, 42, has been the governor's
closest aide and the most powerful political adviser in New York,
an outrageous, foul-mouthed and entertaining mother crocodile who
is called by Albany reporters _ and some in the Pataki
administration _ ``Governor Zenia.'' Now she is at a point of
maximum influence as the manager of Pataki's campaign and as a
senior consultant to D'Amato's.
</P>
<P>
   She is a friend and confidante of both men, and a crucial
strategist behind the governor's presidential ambitions. This week,
as she travels the state with both clients on a joint campaign
trip, her goal is to get D'Amato through the toughest race of his
political career _ she went with him to last Sunday's debate for
what she called ``moral support'' _ and to roll up a big majority
for Pataki to enhance his national credentials. ``I do think the
governor is presidential material,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The paradox of the moment is that she is working for a governor
who is running a feel-good campaign against Peter Vallone, the
speaker of the New York City Council, even though she thrives on
the kind of political combat she learned from D'Amato _ and which
the senator is engaged in now in his race against Rep. Charles
Schumer of Brooklyn. For the record, Ms. Mucha says that she isn't
bored with the campaign for governor, perhaps because she still
manages to get in some fights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's been a commercial where she hasn't said,
`I hate this,''' said Arthur Finkelstein, the media strategist who
handles Pataki's television advertising. Recently Ms. Mucha
objected to a commercial because she said the governor's teeth
weren't white enough, even though Finkelstein said no one would
notice. ``She wore me down,'' he said. ``We had to use a different
angle on his teeth. But the point is, she cares about the details
on that level.'' He added that ``we have a wonderful relationship _
we argue about everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mucha is on leave from her job as the governor's director of
communications, a title that never reflected the influence she had
on nearly every major decision made by the governor. As campaign
manager, she now has almost total control over Pataki's schedule.
``She's kind of a committee of one,'' said Kieran Mahoney, the
campaign strategist who works with Finkelstein. Ms. Mucha also
writes most of Pataki's radio commercials, drafts many of his
television commercials and handles endorsements, like the one from
the Rev. Calvin Butts III, the influential Harlem minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time I knew about it,'' said Mahoney, ``she said,
`Calvin Butts is going to endorse us, and I propose we do it on
this particular day.' And we all said, `OK.' With Zenia, a lot of
stuff ends up on your desk in a package wrapped in a bow and all
you have to do is say yes.''
</P>
<P>
   In Albany, Republicans in the state Senate tell a different
story. In fact, some view her with such alarm that she could be a
Hudson River version of Kali, the Hindu goddess of destruction.
Republicans say she orders around the majority leader in the state
Senate, Joseph Bruno, and blame her for humiliating Bruno when the
governor split with his old ally in a rent-control battle last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't tolerate, really, anybody,'' said John McArdle,
spokesman for the Senate Republicans. Certainly not Betsy McCaughey
Ross, the lieutenant governor who was dumped by Pataki, switched
parties, lost the Democratic primary and is now running against her
former boss on the Liberal Party line. Ms. Mucha was in large part
responsible for the ouster of a woman she considered a
grandstander.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a very quick learner, OK?'' Ms. Mucha said of Ms.
McCaughey Ross. ``But what happened was, her penchant for
attention, the lure of the TV lights, became bigger than her.''
</P>
<P>
   An alternative view in Albany is that the title of ``Governor
Zenia'' is a handy foil for the real governor, who can blame his
unpopular actions on his aide. Pataki himself jokes about this.
``When anything goes wrong,'' he once said, ``blame Zenia and move
on.'' But Michael Finnegan, the governor's former counsel and
longtime friend, says that ``those who would paint Zenia as a
heartless, brainless control freak miss the texture and nuance of
who she is.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends describe a loyal, warm woman who loves to cook elegant
meals and who appreciates fine wines _ Ms. Mucha once sent two
bottles back at a dinner with Pataki and reporters. ``She's very
particular about anything,'' Mahoney said. ``She'll invite you
over, and you show up and you're embarrassed that you're wearing
sweat pants and sneakers because Zenia has got the place decked out
and treats you like visiting royalty.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mucha has an apartment in New York City and shares a house
in the capital with Douglas Rutnik, a lawyer and prominent Albany
Democrat, who recently gave her a ring with an enormous emerald
surrounded by diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not engaged,'' Ms. Mucha said, not quite as if she were
referring to a disease. ``I think I'm past the engagement stage.''
Asked when the wedding (her first) would be, Ms. Mucha responded:
``I don't know. I like the way things are.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporters frequently get expletive-laden diatribes from Ms.
Mucha when they write something that displeases her, although there
can be humor underneath what her admirers say is really an act, or
a tool. ``She winks sometimes if you're observing her when she's
doing it,'' said Pat Lynch, the spokeswoman for Sheldon Silver, the
speaker of the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Not always: This past summer Ms. Mucha left a furious message on
the voice mail of a reporter for The New York Observer, Andrea
Bernstein, that The Observer then printed. ``I hope this will be
the last time that I will need to tell you this because you will be
hearing now from my attorneys,'' The Observer quoted Ms. Mucha as
saying, then printed a string of expletives that she used to
describe the newspaper. (Mahoney said the only thing that surprised
him about the message was that Ms. Mucha left it on tape.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mucha says she remains happiest in the background. ``Can't
we just not talk about my life?'' she asked, in an interview in her
hot, noisy office at Pataki campaign headquarters on Lexington
Avenue. (D'Amato's campaign headquarters are right across the
hall.) And then, later: ``This article to me is like going to have
root canal.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact Ms. Mucha's life is one of the more extraordinary
immigrant success stories in a city full of them, and explains much
of what she became. Born to Ukrainian parents in a village in
northern Poland, where her father worked in a brick factory, Ms.
Mucha spent the first nine years of her life in a house without
plumbing, under Communist rule. ``We lived in absolute fear of one
day someone knocking on your door and taking away your mother and
father and never seeing them again,'' she said. She grew up in a
system, she said, ``where government controlled your thought
process, controlled your ability to make a living, controlled your
education.''
</P>
<P>
   Every year Ms. Mucha's family saved up enough money to make a
trip to Warsaw for the physical exams required for immigration to
the United States, and every year they were rejected because of her
father's poor health. By the 10th year, when Ms. Mucha was 9, they
passed, and came to New York to live on the Lower East Side with
Ms. Mucha's aunt.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mucha's father got work at Greenwood Cemetery as a
gravedigger (he was later a groundskeeper), while Ms. Mucha's
mother cleaned floors at the United Nations. Ms. Mucha entered
third-grade at a neighborhood parochial school, learned English,
and took care of the family. When her parents needed help with
employment and tax forms, Ms. Mucha was the one who went with them,
even at a young age, to translate.
</P>
<P>
   ``She always thought that she would be somebody,'' said Ms.
Mucha's younger sister, Miroslawa Lang, a financial analyst now at
home with her two children in New Rochelle, N.Y. ``She always
thought she would have a different life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mucha studied political science at Brooklyn College, but
left a semester short of graduation because she took a full-time
job in the public relations department of Gimbel's. She has been
meaning to finish her college degree ever since. ``It's a very
personally embarrassing thing for me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A cousin recruited her to work as a volunteer in Eastern
European neighborhoods for D'Amato's 1980 campaign, and as a
fervent anti-Communist she was quickly drawn to the Republican
Party ideology of the time. She was also a kind of soul mate for
another ethnic outsider, D'Amato, whom she once described as ``an
Italian kid from Long Island who spoke funny and who didn't
socialize with the right people, who didn't have the right
background that they perceived a senator should.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Ms. Mucha went to work in D'Amato's press office in New
York, then served him for a dozen years and through several ethics
investigations, one of which led to a rebuke from the Senate Ethics
Committee. She left when Pataki, who was widely seen as controlled
by D'Amato, needed a new press secretary in his 1994 campaign for
governor.
</P>
<P>
   When Pataki's campaign staff suggested Ms. Mucha, Pataki at
first said no. ``I was reluctant because of that whole impression
of D'Amato being the person who dictates what we do in the state,''
Pataki said. But after a few days of press problems, Pataki
relented, and Ms. Mucha has been with him ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mucha caught up with her old boss, D'Amato, the other day in
Kingston, where he spoke at a shopping center with Pataki. Ms.
Mucha and the senator greeted each other like old friends, walked
arm in arm, then got down to business as D'Amato talked intently
and Ms. Mucha took notes. Afterward, D'Amato kissed her goodbye on
the check. ``You've got to miss having Zenia,'' he said.

PETER VALLONE: UNDERDOG KEEPS ON FIGHTING 
</HEADLINE>
  (DUPLICATION NOTICE: Also sent in category `p') 
(bl) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Democratic gubernatorial nominee Peter Vallone had 11
events _ some public, some private, some with the press _ on his
itinerary Thursday. He started with a 7:45 a.m. subway stop on
Manhattan's Upper East Side, went downtown for a fund-raiser with
Chinese-American leaders, visited centers for the elderly in
Brooklyn and attended a Democratic dinner in White Plains and a
reception in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the schedule of a man in retreat.
</P>
<P>
   With his Republican opponent, Gov. George Pataki, ahead in the
polls by a 2-to-1 ratio, pollsters, reporters and some officials in
his own party seem to have written Vallone off. But the candidate
himself is hewing to one stubborn fact: The election has not yet
been held. And until it has, he is not conceding anything.
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic primary, he noted in a speech Wednesday,
``they said I didn't have a chance, I wasn't known. The day before
the election they had me at 35 percent with my opponent surging.
Surprise, surprise: I won with an average of 57 percent in the
entire state of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he really does think that he can pull off an upset.
Perhaps he is in denial. But whatever the psychology, Vallone seems
more driven than ever. He is scaling up his campaigning, and in
some of his public appearances he seems liberated and invigorated,
as if the low-key Queens politician had suddenly been possessed by
the spirit of a Baptist preacher.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere was that more visible than on Vallone's trip upstate
Wednesday. At the Ramada Inn in Albany, he spoke to the New York
Statewide Senior Action Council, and quickly had the 100 senior
citizens assembled eating out of his hand. ``Looking around the
room,'' he began, ``I don't see that many senior citizens. I think
we're going to have to start checking birth certificates here.''
</P>
<P>
   He ended his speech by making a promise about next year's
dinner, to enthusiastic applause: ``Instead of having it here,
we're going to have a barbecue in the backyard of the now-empty
Albany mansion,'' an allusion to the fact that Pataki has not
resided at the Executive Mansion since his election.
</P>
<P>
   In between, he defended President Clinton _ also to applause _
and attacked the governor's school property tax relief program,
which gave refunds this year to elderly homeowners. The refunds, he
asserted, were paid for with ``borrowed money'' that would have to
be repaid. Besides, he added, ``a lot of people who don't own homes
need tax breaks, too.'' Some in the audience nodded vigorously.
</P>
<P>
   Attacking one of the governor's most popular programs shows
either courage or folly, but Vallone increasingly seems to be
throwing caution to the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about misleading statements made by Eliot Spitzer, the
Democratic candidate for attorney general, about his father's role
in financing his campaign, Vallone opted for candor and loyalty
over bland judiciousness. Vallone said his son Peter Jr., who was
also on the trip upstate, had worked with Spitzer, who is a former
assistant Manhattan district attorney. ``What I know about him is
all very commendable,'' Vallone said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he gave a fiery speech at a dinner for Rensselaer County
Democrats. The theme was the same one he struck, with equal
passion, before a large rally in Manhattan on Tuesday night: money,
power, politics. If he is not a valid candidate because he raised
only $6 million to Pataki's $33 million, Vallone asked, ``why
bother having elections? Why don't we just figure out who's got the
most money, who can buy the most commercials, and give it to
them?''
</P>
<P>
   His fire-and-brimstone delivery seems to draw on a growing
reservoir of anger. Pataki has refused to debate Vallone, which has
infuriated Vallone, who sees the refusal as a sign of the chief
executive's lack of accountability. (On a lighter note, he has
begun telling reporters that if they can get Pataki to debate him,
he will take them to Disney World.)
</P>
<P>
   And Vallone clearly believes that Pataki and the Republican
Party bought this election, that early polls sealed the deal and
that Vallone was never taken seriously as a result. One newspaper
columnist wrote that in defeat, Vallone would go into ``oblivion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oblivion?'' said Vallone, who has been speaker of the New York
City Council, and thus the city's second most powerful elected
official, since 1986. ``What kind of word is that?''
</P>
<P>
   If Vallone seems to be simultaneously enjoying the campaign and
wishing for its end, the ambivalence may reflect the experience:
Even slogging uphill, there are unexpected rewards.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, as Vallone and his contingent stood in the lobby of
the Ramada Inn, a woman's calls for help suddenly became audible.
The woman, Sybil Robertson, was in an elevator on the second floor,
unable to get her wheelchair out the door. The Vallones raced
upstairs, and Peter Jr. wheeled her out.
</P>
<P>
   As he did, she spotted the candidate. ``I already voted for
you,'' she said, referring to her absentee ballot. ``I already
mailed it in.'' Her glee was obvious _ and so was Vallone's.

room,'' he began, ``I don't see that many senior citizens. I think
we're going to have to start checking birth certificates here.''
</P>
<P>
   He ended his speech by making a promise about next year's
dinner, to enthusiastic applause: ``Instead of having it here,
we're going to have a barbecue in the backyard of the now-empty
Albany mansion,'' an allusion to the fact that Pataki has not
resided at the Executive Mansion since his election.
</P>
<P>
   In between, he defended President Clinton _ also to applause _
and attacked the governor's school property tax relief program,
which gave refunds this year to elderly homeowners. The refunds, he
asserted, were paid for with ``borrowed money'' that would have to
be repaid. Besides, he added, ``a lot of people who don't own homes
need tax breaks, too.'' Some in the audience nodded vigorously.
</P>
<P>
   Attacking one of the governor's most popular programs shows
either courage or folly, but Vallone increasingly seems to be
throwing caution to the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about misleading statements made by Eliot Spitzer, the
Democratic candidate for attorney general, about his father's role
in financing his campaign, Vallone opted for candor and loyalty
over bland judiciousness. Vallone said his son Peter Jr., who was
also on the trip upstate, had worked with Spitzer, who is a former
assistant Manhattan district attorney. ``What I know about him is
all very commendable,'' Vallone said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he gave a fiery speech at a dinner for Rensselaer County
Democrats. The theme was the same one he struck, with equal
passion, before a large rally in Manhattan on Tuesday night: money,
power, politics. If he is not a valid candidate because he raised
only $6 million to Pataki's $33 million, Vallone asked, ``why
bother having elections? Why don't we just figure out who's got the
most money, who can buy the most commercials, and give it to
them?''
</P>
<P>
   His fire-and-brimstone delivery seems to draw on a growing
reservoir of anger. Pataki has refused to debate Vallone, which has
infuriated Vallone, who sees the refusal as a sign of the chief
executive's lack of accountability. (On a lighter note, he has
begun telling reporters that if they can get Pataki to debate him,
he will take them to Disney World.)
</P>
<P>
   And Vallone clearly believes that Pataki and the Republican
Party bought this election, that early polls sealed the deal and
that Vallone was never taken seriously as a result. One newspaper
columnist wrote that in defeat, Vallone would go into ``oblivion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oblivion?'' said Vallone, who has been speaker of the New York
City Council, and thus the city's second most powerful elected
official, since 1986. ``What kind of word is that?''
</P>
<P>
   If Vallone seems to be simultaneously enjoying the campaign and
wishing for its end, the ambivalence may reflect the experience:
Even slogging uphill, there are unexpected rewards.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, as Vallone and his contingent stood in the lobby of
the Ramada Inn, a woman's calls for help suddenly became audible.
The woman, Sybil Robertson, was in an elevator on the second floor,
unable to get her wheelchair out the door. The Vallones raced
upstairs, and Peter Jr. wheeled her out.
</P>
<P>
   As he did, she spotted the candidate. ``I already voted for
you,'' she said, referring to her absentee ballot. ``I already
mailed it in.'' Her glee was obvious _ and so was Vallone's.

INVESTORS CAUTIOUSLY RETURNED TO EQUITY FUNDS IN SEPTEMBER 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mutual fund investors tiptoed back into equities in
September, apparently encouraged as the stock market became less
volatile and equities regained some of the ground they had lost in
July and August.
</P>
<P>
   But investors have generally continued to demonstrate caution,
fund industry analysts say, and in both September and October have
funneled about as much new money to bond funds and other
conservative investments as to stocks.
</P>
<P>
   If investors were hesitant, stock fund portfolio managers were
more so. In aggregate, they put none of September's new cash to
work in the market; instead they sold enough shares of stock to
raise the level of cash to its highest level in 17 months.
</P>
<P>
   Equity funds received $6.5 billion in net new investments in
September, the Investment Company Institute, a trade group,
reported Thursday. That is a sharp reversal from the $11.7 billion
in net withdrawals that the funds experienced in August, when
gyrating financial markets caused investors to flee stocks for the
safety of bonds and money market funds.
</P>
<P>
   The cash flow report might not be as positive as it sounds,
however, because the assets that were diverted to money market
funds in August have largely stayed there. The positive cash flows
in September resulted from current fund investors not withdrawing
as much as they did the previous month, while new sales of mutual
fund shares remained flat. Among those who already owned shares in
stock funds, more exchanges were made out of those funds than into
them for the third consecutive month.
</P>
<P>
   Bond funds added $5.6 billion in net new investments in
September, up slightly from $5.4 billion in August, and money
market funds received $7.4 billion in net new cash last month. In
August, as the stock market swooned, money market funds gained
$50.4 billion in new money.
</P>
<P>
   Hybrid funds, which spread their assets across stocks, bonds and
cash, saw $465 million flow out in September, less than the $948
million that flowed out in August.
</P>
<P>
   The institute's cash flow reports include new purchases of fund
shares less redemptions, or withdrawals, from funds, plus the net
amount of money exchanged from one type of fund to another within
the same fund company.
</P>
<P>
   Even more prudent than fund investors were equity portfolio
managers, who raised the level of cash in stock funds to 6.2
percent of assets, or $155 billion, from 6 percent, or $142
billion, in August.
</P>
<P>
   That is the highest percentage since April 1997, and it
represents a substantial amount of buying power on the sidelines.
From the looks of the recent rebound in the major stock indexes,
some of it was probably put to work this month.
</P>
<P>
   Fund companies issued mixed reports Thursday as to whether
investors have continued to make new purchases of stock funds in
October. The Vanguard Group said its customers poured about $650
million into stock funds this month, while purchasing $1 billion of
bond funds and nearly $2 billion of money market funds.
</P>
<P>
   But Charles Schwab, the discount brokerage, reported that
investors made net withdrawals from the stock funds it sells. Trim
Tabs, an independent tracker of fund flows, estimated that about $5
billion each have flowed into stock and bond funds this month.
</P>
<P>
   Total assets in all mutual funds _ stock, bond and money market
funds _ grew to $4.9 trillion in September from $4.7 trillion in
August. But the total remains below the peak of $5.1 trillion in
June.

ZANARDI GEARED UP FOR A PARTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL SCHLOTTER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA, Calif. _ It's almost as if the motor moguls behind the
CART FedEx Championship Series envisioned Alex Zanardi's
drama-draining sprint to the 1998 series-season title.
</P>
<P>
   And knowing that the daring Italian would have the championship
locked up long before Sunday's Marlboro 500 at the California
Speedway, they figured they needed a plan to inject a little
excitement into the season's final race.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme they agreed on _ in truth, long before Zanardi's tour
de force _ will cost them $1 million Sunday, all of it going to the
race winner in the richest CART payoff since the 1996 U.S. 500.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday's race will be every bit as rich in emotion as it is
in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Zanardi is ending his three-year reign of CART terror to move to
Formula One racing and would love to go out with a win. And the
17-year career of tour elder statesman Bobby Rahal comes to an end
as well on Sunday. The 1986 Indy 500 winner also would love to go
out a winner. There are other themes to follow as well.
</P>
<P>
   Another Zanardi victory would tie him for wins in a single
season with Michael Andretti and Al Unser Jr. at eight. And while
first place is decided, the competition to be Zanardi's runner-up
is fierce.
</P>
<P>
   Scotsman Dario Franchitti _ who has three victories, a second
and a fourth in the past five events _ is the tour's hottest driver
at the moment and has a 12-point lead over Zanardi teammate and
1996 tour champ Jimmy Vasser. Just six points behind Vasser, and
very much in striking distance of second place, is Mexico's Adrian
Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Franchetti has won three times this season, Vasser and Fernandez
twice each.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's race also will be the second in CART history run under
the influence of the Handford device.
</P>
<P>
   The winglike structure was designed to slow the cars after
drivers reached speeds of over 240 mph in last year's Marlboro 500.
And in its first appearance, at July's U.S. 500 in Michigan, the
device kept the field tightly bunched and led to unusually tight
racing, with a CART-record 62 lead changes.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100,000 fans are expected for Sunday's 12:30 p.m.
race, with an estimated 8,000 grandstand seats available as of
Thursday night. Many more seats were available for today's practice
and Saturday's CART qualifying and Indy Lights 100-mile race.
</P>
<P>
   __ Speedway 1999 schedule: CART, Indy Lights and NASCAR's
Winston Cup, Busch Grand National, Craftsman Truck and Winston West
tours will all be back at California Speedway next season,
according to a track schedule released this week.
</P>
<P>
   But the packaging of the events will be different. Instead of
three racing weekends, there will be just two.
</P>
<P>
   The first will run Friday, April 30 through Sunday, May 2 and
focus around the NASCAR Winston Cup California 500. Also racing
that weekend will be the Busch Grand National and Winston West
tours.
</P>
<P>
   The second weekend runs Oct. 29 through Oct. 31 and culminates
with the running of the CART FedEx Marlboro 500. Included in the
package will be Oct. 30 appearances by the Indy Lights cars and the
NASCAR Craftsman Truck series.
</P>
<P>
   The scheduling _ thankfully _ leaves the Speedway free of a
midsummer event. This year's July appearances by the NASCAR Busch,
truck and Winston racers were accompanied by temperatures well over
100 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   __ Coronation Sunday?: Jeff Gordon can wrap up his third Winston
Cup title of the past four years with a 40th-place finish at
Sunday's ACDelco 400 in Rockingham, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who finished second to teammate Terry Labonte in the
1996 Winston Cup points race, takes a 329-point lead to Rockingham
with just two races remaining. But Gordon says he'll take the title
however and wherever it comes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to win that third championship and it doesn't
really matter where it happens,'' Gordon said. ``If we can run well
and get a good finish or a win at Rockingham, it can happen
there.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Nuts and bolts: Tickets are on sale for the NHRA's season
finale Winston Finals at Pomona Raceway, Nov. 12-15. Information:
1-800-884-6472.... Simi Valley racers Rick Hendrix and Alex Harris
increased their leads in USAC midget and three-quarter midget
standings Saturday with victories in the USAC show at the Ventura
County Fairgrounds.... Granada Hills' M.K. Kanke was 15th in
Saturday's Featherlite Southwest Tour race in Phoenix and is in
third place in season points, 49 points behind leader Steve
Portenga.... Rusty Wallace's win in last Sunday's Dura-Lube 500 in
Phoenix broke a winless streak of 59 races.... The Dura-Lube race
kept a streak alive for Labonte, 600 consecutive starts.... Dale
Jarrett was released from a Phoenix hospital Thursday and might
drive in Sunday's AC Delco 400.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Republicans and Democrats compete for advantage in the dash
toward Election Day, Americans view Republicans as more ethical but
say Democrats can better tackle the pivotal issues of education,
health care and the future of Medicare and Social Security, the
latest New York Times/CBS News Poll shows.
</P>
<P>
   And nearly seven out of 10 said that the drama that has
dominated the news throughout the year _ the White House sex
scandal _ would not affect how they voted in congressional races.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that the outcome of Tuesday's
congressional elections could shift significantly, depending on
which party can best get _ maybe even goad _ its supporters to the
polls. If turnout is average for a midterm election, for example,
neither side has a particular edge in the popular vote. But the
poll showed that Republicans' prospects would surge if, as some
analysts predict, turnout is unusually low.
</P>
<P>
   The poll helps explain why House Republicans decided
unexpectedly late this week to inject the scandal into the closing
debate with a multimillion-dollar advertising blitz. It also
explains why Democrats fired back with a commercial of their own
that emphasizes issues _ and the need to move beyond the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   At the close of a seemingly mercurial election season, featuring
a stormy and late session of Congress, Democrats and Republicans
are playing to their strengths: The poll found that one issue on
which Republicans have a decided advantage over Democrats _ 41
percent to 24 percent _ is the question of who has higher moral
standards.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, people expressed far greater confidence in
Democrats on a host of consequential issues. Fifty-one percent
voiced confidence that Democrats could improve education; only 30
percent said that of Republicans. And 57 percent said Democrats
were more likely to improve the health-care system; only 24 percent
said that of Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most striking, in what may be a sign of peril for
Republicans well beyond next week's election, the survey found that
the party has lost its edge on the issue of tax cuts, long a
centerpiece of Republican campaigns. While many candidates are
still hammering away about taxes this year, the poll found that the
public no longer associates Republicans, any more than Democrats,
with reducing taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Also encouraging for Democrats, the survey found a wide public
view that President Clinton is doing a good job _ a belief that has
prevailed despite the reverberations since January about his affair
with Monica Lewinsky. Sixty-five percent of Americans give Clinton
a high job-approval rating; the same proportion approve of his
handling of foreign policy. And 74 percent approve of how he is
handling the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The nationwide telephone poll of 1,118 adults was conducted
Monday through Wednesday. It has a margin of sampling error of
three percentage points in either direction.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike presidential campaigns, when the public's interest
escalates closer to Election Day, the poll found no such movement
this year. That may be because, as is often the case in midterm
campaigns, there do not seem to be any galvanizing issues.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, despite the broad perceptions of the parties, many
House, Senate and gubernatorial contests will turn on local issues,
strengths and weaknesses of individual candidates, and the potency
and force of local advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters are all over the map,'' said Fred Yang, a Democratic
pollster. ``There's no roiling issues. And there aren't any roiling
themes.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Fabrizio, a Republican pollster, said, ``Neither side has
really had a rallying cry.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a far different, and certainly calmer, environment from
what prevailed at this point four years ago, when voters were
furious about the doomed Clinton health-care plan and uncertain
about the economic picture.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, barely half of Americans rated the national
economy as good; now the figure is more than 80 percent. Then, more
than 70 percent disapproved of the way Congress handled its job;
that figure is now 49 percent. In the subsequent elections of 1994,
voters ousted Democrats from control of the House for the first
time in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, incumbents in both parties can take solace in the
fact that the public is far less restless than in past elections.
Half the respondents said that their own representative deserved
re-election. And 65 percent disagreed with the notion that
government would work better if all new people were elected this
year. In November 1994, 54 percent disagreed with that idea; in
June 1992, 49 percent disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   While no national poll can anticipate what will happen in
specific states and congressional districts on Election Day, the
survey found that neither Democrats nor Republicans are enjoying
any significant advantage. More than anything else, the outcome may
be tied to turnout.
</P>
<P>
   If turnout remains relatively steady for a midterm election _ at
about 39 percent of the voting-age population _ the poll shows a
vote of 48 percent for Republicans and 43 percent for Democrats.
But that difference is within the margin of error of plus or minus
five percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   If turnout is unusually high, about 47 percent, the vote would
be 45 percent for Republicans and 44 percent for Democrats. But
Republicans would have their biggest advantage if the fewest people
go to the polls. If turnout is only 31 percent, 51 percent of
voters say they would support Republican candidates while 41
percent would back Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also underscored why even some Republicans fear that
the commercials capitalizing on Clinton's troubles could backfire.
The public continues to view the impeachment inquiry in Congress as
having more to do with attempts at political gain by Republicans
than a sincere investigation of serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of Americans view the House Judiciary Committee's
handling of the matter negatively; most expressed little faith that
the hearings would be conducted fairly. The public is three times
more likely to blame Republicans than Democrats for that
partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   More than two-thirds of the public said Clinton's actions were
not consequential enough to warrant his being impeached and removed
from office. A plurality want the matter dropped entirely. Nearly
three-quarters of Americans say it would be better for the country
if Clinton finished his term rather than resigned, a seven-point
increase from a poll conducted two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Though a plurality chose Republicans over Democrats on the
question of who has higher moral standards, neither party is viewed
as putting forward candidates who are more honest. But 47 percent
say Republicans are seen as better able to uphold traditional
family values, compared with 31 percent for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats are viewed as more likely to understand the needs
and problems of American families by a margin of 50 percent to 28
percent. On issue after issue, Democrats have an advantage over
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, 53 percent of those polled said Democrats were
more likely to make the right decisions about Medicare; only 28
percent said that of Republicans. Fifty-two percent said Democrats
would make the right decisions about Social Security; for
Republicans the figure was 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   People also said, by a margin of 44 percent to 33 percent, that
the Democratic Party had better ideas than the Republican Party for
leading the country into the 21st century.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Upholding a pattern that has persisted for years, even though
people are relatively satisfied with their own representatives,
voters registered harsher evaluations of Congress as a whole.
Nearly two-thirds said that most members of Congress had not done a
good enough job to deserve re-election.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, most Americans give low marks to the current
session of Congress. A majority said Congress accomplished less in
1997 and 1998 than lawmakers do in a typical two-year period.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether their own representative cared more about their
needs or those of special interest groups, 45 percent said their
needs and 39 percent cited interest groups. But asked about
Congress in general, 64 percent said most representatives were more
interested in doing the work of special interest groups than in
addressing the concerns of voters.
</P>
<P>
   Lambasting the Republican-controlled Congress, one poll
respondent, Emmajean Dry, 59, of Dallas, said in a follow-up
interview, ``Congress has done nothing except try to get rid of
Clinton _ and ruin the Democrats.'' Ms. Dry said she planned to
vote for Democrats next week.
</P>
<P>
   William Selby, 32, a Republican respondent to the poll who
installs garage doors in Maryland, said he was not dissatisfied
with Congress. ``Congress is doing well, doing what they were
elected to do,'' he said. ``Impeachment hearings is what they
should be doing by law.'' But, he said of the scandal, ``They could
probably be doing more if they didn't have the presidential
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The public was divided over whether the country needs a
Republican Congress to keep a check on a Democratic president.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that Speaker Newt Gingrich's already low
favorability rating has dipped to its lowest levels since January
1997, when he was embroiled in an ethics case. His favorability
rating now stands at 18 percent; his unfavorability rating is 43
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the Judiciary Committee, is
still unknown to most Americans even though he is presiding over
the impeachment inquiry. Sixty-two percent of Americans said they
do not know enough about him to register an opinion.
</P>
<P>
   In a year when as many as two-thirds of Americans are expected
to stay clear of the polls on Election Day, the survey found that
those people stand out in several ways from those who do vote. For
instance, the nonvoters are younger and less educated, have lower
incomes, and tend to prefer Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-three percent of the nonvoters have not attended college,
while only 43 percent of expected voters have not attended college.
Forty percent of nonvoters have family incomes of under $30,000 a
year, compared with 24 percent of expected voters. And 32 percent
of nonvoters are under the age of 30, compared with 13 percent of
the voters.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to whom they prefer for Congress, 49 percent of
the nonvoters said Democrats and 27 percent said Republicans. Those
who were expected to vote were evenly divided.
</P>
<P>
   Even people who say they plan to vote expressed dismay with the
state of American politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I disagree with all the negativism,'' said Mathew Feldman, 65,
a Democrat from Maryland. ``It has turned me off to a degree. I
wish it focused on what individuals can and will do, not just
knocking down the other person. There is a lot of money being
wasted on all campaigns.''

<P>
   As Republicans and Democrats compete for advantage in the dash
toward Election Day, Americans view Republicans as more ethical but
say Democrats can better tackle the pivotal issues of education,
health care and the future of Medicare and Social Security, the
latest New York Times/CBS News Poll shows.
</P>
<P>
   And nearly seven out of 10 said that the drama that has
dominated the news throughout the year _ the White House sex
scandal _ would not affect how they voted in congressional races.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that the outcome of Tuesday's
congressional elections could shift significantly, depending on
which party can best get _ maybe even goad _ its supporters to the
polls. If turnout is average for a midterm election, for example,
neither side has a particular edge in the popular vote. But the
poll showed that Republicans' prospects would surge if, as some
analysts predict, turnout is unusually low.
</P>
<P>
   The poll helps explain why House Republicans decided
unexpectedly late this week to inject the scandal into the closing
debate with a multimillion-dollar advertising blitz. It also
explains why Democrats fired back with a commercial of their own
that emphasizes issues _ and the need to move beyond the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   At the close of a seemingly mercurial election season, featuring
a stormy and late session of Congress, Democrats and Republicans
are playing to their strengths: The poll found that one issue on
which Republicans have a decided advantage over Democrats _ 41
percent to 24 percent _ is the question of who has higher moral
standards.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, people expressed far greater confidence in
Democrats on a host of consequential issues. Fifty-one percent
voiced confidence that Democrats could improve education; only 30
percent said that of Republicans. And 57 percent said Democrats
were more likely to improve the health-care system; only 24 percent
said that of Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most striking, in what may be a sign of peril for
Republicans well beyond next week's election, the survey found that
the party has lost its edge on the issue of tax cuts, long a
centerpiece of Republican campaigns. While many candidates are
still hammering away about taxes this year, the poll found that the
public no longer associates Republicans, any more than Democrats,
with reducing taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Also encouraging for Democrats, the survey found a wide public
view that President Clinton is doing a good job _ a belief that has
prevailed despite the reverberations since January about his affair
with Monica Lewinsky. Sixty-five percent of Americans give Clinton
a high job-approval rating; the same proportion approve of his
handling of foreign policy. And 74 percent approve of how he is
handling the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The nationwide telephone poll of 1,118 adults was conducted
Monday through Wednesday. It has a margin of sampling error of
three percentage points in either direction.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike presidential campaigns, when the public's interest
escalates closer to Election Day, the poll found no such movement
this year. That may be because, as is often the case in midterm
campaigns, there do not seem to be any galvanizing issues.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, despite the broad perceptions of the parties, many
House, Senate and gubernatorial contests will turn on local issues,
strengths and weaknesses of individual candidates, and the potency
and force of local advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters are all over the map,'' said Fred Yang, a Democratic
pollster. ``There's no roiling issues. And there aren't any roiling
themes.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Fabrizio, a Republican pollster, said, ``Neither side has
really had a rallying cry.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a far different, and certainly calmer, environment from
what prevailed at this point four years ago, when voters were
furious about the doomed Clinton health-care plan and uncertain
about the economic picture.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, barely half of Americans rated the national
economy as good; now the figure is more than 80 percent. Then, more
than 70 percent disapproved of the way Congress handled its job;
that figure is now 49 percent. In the subsequent elections of 1994,
voters ousted Democrats from control of the House for the first
time in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, incumbents in both parties can take solace in the
fact that the public is far less restless than in past elections.
Half the respondents said that their own representative deserved
re-election. And 65 percent disagreed with the notion that
government would work better if all new people were elected this
year. In November 1994, 54 percent disagreed with that idea; in
June 1992, 49 percent disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   While no national poll can anticipate what will happen in
specific states and congressional districts on Election Day, the
survey found that neither Democrats nor Republicans are enjoying
any significant advantage. More than anything else, the outcome may
be tied to turnout.
</P>
<P>
   If turnout remains relatively steady for a midterm election _ at
about 39 percent of the voting-age population _ the poll shows a
vote of 48 percent for Republicans and 43 percent for Democrats.
But that difference is within the margin of error of plus or minus
five percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   If turnout is unusually high, about 47 percent, the vote would
be 45 percent for Republicans and 44 percent for Democrats. But
Republicans would have their biggest advantage if the fewest people
go to the polls. If turnout is only 31 percent, 51 percent of
voters say they would support Republican candidates while 41
percent would back Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also underscored why even some Republicans fear that
the commercials capitalizing on Clinton's troubles could backfire.
The public continues to view the impeachment inquiry in Congress as
having more to do with attempts at political gain by Republicans
than a sincere investigation of serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of Americans view the House Judiciary Committee's
handling of the matter negatively; most expressed little faith that
the hearings would be conducted fairly. The public is three times
more likely to blame Republicans than Democrats for that
partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   More than two-thirds of the public said Clinton's actions were
not consequential enough to warrant his being impeached and removed
from office. A plurality want the matter dropped entirely. Nearly
three-quarters of Americans say it would be better for the country
if Clinton finished his term rather than resigned, a seven-point
increase from a poll conducted two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Though a plurality chose Republicans over Democrats on the
question of who has higher moral standards, neither party is viewed
as putting forward candidates who are more honest. But 47 percent
say Republicans are seen as better able to uphold traditional
family values, compared with 31 percent for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats are viewed as more likely to understand the needs
and problems of American families by a margin of 50 percent to 28
percent. On issue after issue, Democrats have an advantage over
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, 53 percent of those polled said Democrats were
more likely to make the right decisions about Medicare; only 28
percent said that of Republicans. Fifty-two percent said Democrats
would make the right decisions about Social Security; for
Republicans the figure was 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   People also said, by a margin of 44 percent to 33 percent, that
the Democratic Party had better ideas than the Republican Party for
leading the country into the 21st century.

</P>
<P>
   Upholding a pattern that has persisted for years, even though
people are relatively satisfied with their own representatives,
voters registered harsher evaluations of Congress as a whole.
Nearly two-thirds said that most members of Congress had not done a
good enough job to deserve re-election.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, most Americans give low marks to the current
session of Congress. A majority said Congress accomplished less in
1997 and 1998 than lawmakers do in a typical two-year period.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether their own representative cared more about their
needs or those of special interest groups, 45 percent said their
needs and 39 percent cited interest groups. But asked about
Congress in general, 64 percent said most representatives were more
interested in doing the work of special interest groups than in
addressing the concerns of voters.
</P>
<P>
   Lambasting the Republican-controlled Congress, one poll
respondent, Emmajean Dry, 59, of Dallas, said in a follow-up
interview, ``Congress has done nothing except try to get rid of
Clinton _ and ruin the Democrats.'' Ms. Dry said she planned to
vote for Democrats next week.
</P>
<P>
   William Selby, 32, a Republican respondent to the poll who
installs garage doors in Maryland, said he was not dissatisfied
with Congress. ``Congress is doing well, doing what they were
elected to do,'' he said. ``Impeachment hearings is what they
should be doing by law.'' But, he said of the scandal, ``They could
probably be doing more if they didn't have the presidential
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The public was divided over whether the country needs a
Republican Congress to keep a check on a Democratic president.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that Speaker Newt Gingrich's already low
favorability rating has dipped to its lowest levels since January
1997, when he was embroiled in an ethics case. His favorability
rating now stands at 18 percent; his unfavorability rating is 43
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the Judiciary Committee, is
still unknown to most Americans even though he is presiding over
the impeachment inquiry. Sixty-two percent of Americans said they
do not know enough about him to register an opinion.
</P>
<P>
   In a year when as many as two-thirds of Americans are expected
to stay clear of the polls on Election Day, the survey found that
those people stand out in several ways from those who do vote. For
instance, the nonvoters are younger and less educated, have lower
incomes, and tend to prefer Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-three percent of the nonvoters have not attended college,
while only 43 percent of expected voters have not attended college.
Forty percent of nonvoters have family incomes of under $30,000 a
year, compared with 24 percent of expected voters. And 32 percent
of nonvoters are under the age of 30, compared with 13 percent of
the voters.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to whom they prefer for Congress, 49 percent of
the nonvoters said Democrats and 27 percent said Republicans. Those
who were expected to vote were evenly divided.
</P>
<P>
   Even people who say they plan to vote expressed dismay with the
state of American politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I disagree with all the negativism,'' said Mathew Feldman, 65,
a Democrat from Maryland. ``It has turned me off to a degree. I
wish it focused on what individuals can and will do, not just
knocking down the other person. There is a lot of money being
wasted on all campaigns.''

<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ John Glenn, an astronaut again at 77,
returned to orbit Thursday in the space shuttle Discovery for a
rendezvous with the memory of a time when exploits of early
astronauts held the world in thrall and for a long-awaited encore,
this time as the oldest traveler in outer space.
</P>
<P>
   At 2:19 p.m., after two suspenseful delays, the shuttle's two
rockets and three engines ignited in flames and billowing vapors
and lifted the seven-member crew _ including Glenn, the retiring
Democratic Senator from Ohio and the first American to circle the
planet _ into an orbit some 345 miles above Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Liftoff of Discovery with a crew of six astronaut heroes and
one American legend,'' intoned Lisa Malone, the countdown
commentator, at the moment the shuttle rose into a cloudless blue
sky.
</P>
<P>
   Although Glenn's flight had been criticized in many quarters as
a publicity stunt and political payoff with little scientific
value, an estimated 250,000 visitors to the Kennedy Space Center
and surrounding communities, one of the biggest crowds to see a
shuttle departure, followed Discovery's ascent, watching until it
was no more than a vanishing point of light more than five minutes
after liftoff. President Clinton, watching with Mrs. Clinton from
the roof of the Launch Control Center, was the first sitting
president to see a space launching here since Richard Nixon watched
the takeoff of Apollo 12 in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on CNN before the liftoff, Clinton pointed out
that Thursday's flight _ the last mission before NASA begins
launching the International Space Station in December _ was the end
of an era. ``So John Glenn began this first phase of our space
program, and he's ending it just before we start on the space
station,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after Discovery reached orbit, Lt. Col. Curtis
Brown, the commander, looked over at Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let the record show, John has a smile on his face and it goes
from ear to ear,'' Brown told Mission Control. ``We haven't been
able to remove it yet.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first radio communication with Mission Control, Glenn was
ebullient. ``A trite old statement: Zero-G and I feel fine,'' he
said, paraphrasing his first reaction to zero gravity, in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Looking down on the Hawaiian islands, Glenn said: ``Today is
beautiful and great. I just can't even describe it.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 36 years ago, on Feb. 20, 1962, Glenn, then 40,
rocketed aloft from here to become the first American to orbit the
planet. Alone, squeezed into a tiny Mercury capsule, he made all of
three orbits of Earth on a flight that lasted five hours. Thursday,
aboard the relatively commodious Discovery, with 70 times the room
of the Mercury capsule, Glenn began a mission planned to last nine
days.
</P>
<P>
   Two younger astronauts, Brown and Lt. Col. Steven Lindsey, both
of the Air Force, were at the controls of Discovery. From his
passenger seat in the compartment below the flight deck, Glenn felt
the bump at liftoff and the increasing vibration and noise of the
first two minutes of surging rocket power, 20 times the thrust of
the Atlas rocket that first put him in orbit. When Discovery's two
solid-rocket boosters were jettisoned after a little more than two
minutes, Glenn felt a sharper jolt and might have caught sight of a
flash of light in the tiny compartment window.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, it was a more comfortable ascent this time. At
most, the rocket power exerted on Glenn's body pressures about
three times the normal force of gravity at sea level. The pressure
was certainly nothing like the G-forces from the Atlas, which
reached eight times normal levels.
</P>
<P>
   As the shuttle's three hydrogen engines burned, Glenn could
begin to relax to the steady whirring of turbines and fans. Eight
and a half minutes after ignition, he and the other Discovery
astronauts had reached orbit and, unbuckling the straps that
secured them during liftoff, experienced the floating sensation of
weightlessness. On his Friendship 7 flight in 1962, Glenn never got
the chance to unbuckle and had no place to stretch out.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the day the crew moved slowly about Discovery,
opening the cargo-bay doors and activating the systems and
scientific instruments in the pressurized Spacehab module in the
cargo bay where astronauts are to conduct many of their
experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Generally overlooked in the avid attention on Glenn is the
multinational crew, including a Japanese and a Spanish astronaut.
The crew is to get busy on Friday with dozens of astronomy
observations, tests of hardware for the Hubble Space Telescope, and
experiments concerning the effects of a low-gravity environment on
living organisms and human physiology.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the scientific work will be handled by Dr. Stephen
Robinson, an engineer; Pedro Duque, an aeronautical engineer who is
representing the European Space Agency, and Dr. Chiaki Mukai, a
Japanese physician and medical researcher. Glenn's primary duty
will be to act as a test subject for investigations of
physiological changes from space flight that appear to parallel
similar changes in aging humans. His attending physician for many
tests will be Dr. Scott Parazynski.
</P>
<P>
   Such studies point up one of the sharpest contrasts between this
flight and Glenn's first. ``Back then, the issue was not successful
experiments but survival,'' Glenn said in a recent magazine
interview. ``Doctors weren't sure whether humans could take eight
G's going up and coming down. As test pilots, our job was to find
out what we could do and couldn't do. Did our eyeballs change
shape? Would inner-ear fluid move differently? Could we even
swallow?''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the Discovery was operating normally, but
engineers said they were investigating the apparent loss of a
small, insulated aluminum panel near the tail. A videotape of the
launching showed the panel dropping off two seconds after
main-engine ignition. The panel appeared to be the cover over a
stowed parachute, which is deployed at landing to slow the shuttle
on the runway.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Donald McMonagle, a shuttle official at
the Kennedy center, said the incident was not expected to pose any
additional risk or cause any change in mission plans. The shuttle
could land without the ``drogue chute,'' which was added to the
shuttles for extra braking force only after more than 50 safe
landings without chutes. And the problem presented ``no hazard to
operations of the vehicle in orbit,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A more detailed analysis of the problem is expected to be made
on Friday, McMonagle said.
</P>
<P>
   The day of Glenn's second launching broke warm and clear, with
no signs of technical trouble on Discovery at Pad 39-B. Before his
first mission, Glenn had to wait out 10 weather or mechanical
postponements between December and Feb. 20 before he finally lifted
off.
</P>
<P>
   The countdown on Thursday proceeded smoothly toward a scheduled
2 p.m. liftoff. At a pause at T-minus-9 minutes, Scott Carpenter,
the astronaut who was Glenn's backup pilot in 1962, had some
parting words echoing his famous farewell to the Mercury flight,
which was ``Godspeed, John Glenn.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the crew, Carpenter said, ``At this point in the
count, it seems appropriate to say to the crew, good luck, have a
safe flight, and to say once again, ``Godspeed, John Glenn.''
</P>
<P>
   But Discovery was not going anywhere yet. Some alarms sounded in
the cockpit and were recorded at Mission Control in Houston. The
countdown was halted while engineers considered possible problems
with pressures in the crew module, and soon established that there
was nothing to fear. Then at T-minus-5 minutes, the count was
interrupted again as one private airplane and then another were
spotted flying into restricted airspace near the Kennedy launching
area.
</P>
<P>
   The liftoff seemed trouble-free, until the examination of video
recordings revealed the piece of metal that seemed to break loose
and hit the nozzle of the shuttle's center engine. Investigators
were trying to find out if it was indeed the parachute panel that
fell off. It is a piece of waffle-shaped aluminum 18 inches wide,
22 inches long and 1.7 inches thick.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important maneuvers of the mission is to come on
the fourth day. The Discovery astronauts plan to release a small
satellite called Spartan for two days of observations of the sun's
corona, or outer atmosphere, and its effects on the space
environment throughout the solar system. The satellite is to be
retrieved before the shuttle returns to Earth. The landing is
scheduled for Nov. 7 here at the Kennedy center.
</P>
<P>
   The mission is the 92nd by a shuttle since the reusable craft
were introduced in 1981. And it is the 121st American flight of
astronauts since John Glenn made history with his first flight.
Shortly after 7 p. m., Glenn passed his old space flight record of
five minutes under five hours, and he had eight days ahead of him
on the return flight he had longed to take ever since February
1962.

GUILIANI, RIORDAN TRADE GENTLE BARBS OVER TITLE TO NATION'S NO. 1
CITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Mayor Richard Riordan declared Thursday that he's
the rock 'n' roll mayor while his cross country rival New York
Mayor Rudy Giuliani simply lives in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting in Los Angeles to endorse a gubernatorial candidate,
Riordan reminded Giuliani that the City of Angels won back the
Grammy Awards this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him when he lost the Grammys to us that it was right
since he didn't really appreciate the music,'' Riordan said during
a news conference. ``The last popular music he heard was from
Nelson Eddy and Jeanette McDonald. I like Axl Rose and Courtney
Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so, insisted Giuliani. It's just that he has different
tastes in music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like opera,'' Giuliani said. ``I was probably the only one
awake when they gave out the classical music awards.''
</P>
<P>
   It was one of many such pointed exchanges while the mayors
announced their support for Attorney General Dan Lungren for
California governor in the race against Lt. Gov. Gray Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Introducing Giuliani during a news conference downtown at Parker
Center, Riordan noted that ``he is the mayor of the second-best
city in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Countered Giuliani, ``It's nice to be in the city that's number
. . . It's nice to be in Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Giuliani said, he and Riordan have more in common
than most think.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're both Republican mayors of big cities who have made
dramatic changes,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1993, when we were both first elected, we were on `Meet the
Press' together and (host) Tim Russert threw a bunch of questions
at us and we agreed on every one -- and we hadn't even talked about
any of it before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Giuliani noted, Riordan is an ex-New Yorker governing a
city that many ex-New Yorkers now call home.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Riordan was in New York as part of a campaign
to attract capital from that city's financial district to help
California firms.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the New Los Angeles Marketing Partnership
group waged a $100,000 advertising campaign in New York newspapers,
touting the city of Los Angeles. The ads showed a red apple turning
green, with the message: ``New York was turning green with envy.''
</P>
<P>
   An embarrassed Riordan tried to soften that attack, saying
Giuliani was responsible ``for making the Big Apple shinier and
redder.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's trip to Los Angeles is part of a nationwide swing he
has been making on behalf of Republican opponents around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The New York mayor said he has known Lungren for 18 years and
believed it was important to speak on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how much weight the endorsement of a New York
mayor has, but it is important to elect Dan Lungren,'' Giuliani
said. ``He will be good for California and good for the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Riordan said his backing of Lungren was based on his belief the
attorney general would provide strong support for public safety
programs as well as help push change in the state's education
system.
</P>
<P>
   Also speaking on Lungren's behalf were representatives of the
Crime Victims Memorial Fund.

   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Traveling through the state that will hold
the first presidential primary in the year 2000, Gov. Christie
Whitman of New Jersey told a group of New Hampshire Republicans on
Thursday that she had no intention of seeking her party's
nomination for president.
</P>
<P>
   But in her comments to reporters, and in a speech she later gave
at Harvard University, Whitman made it clear that she would not
relinquish her role as a nationally recognized leader of the
Republican Party's moderate wing.
</P>
<P>
   On a two-day swing through New England, Whitman criticized her
own party's attempts to make the 1998 congressional election a
referendum on President Clinton's sex scandal. Addressing students
at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of government, Whitman also
criticized the National Organization for Women and other feminist
groups for failing to condemn Clinton's behavior involving Monica
Lewinsky and Paula Jones.
</P>
<P>
   And Whitman blushed when a member of the Nashua, N.H., Chamber
of Commerce asked whether she had considered running on a national
ticket headed by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas _ presumably with
Whitman as the vice presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' Whitman said, appearing uneasy with the
question. ``That wouldn't be a decision for me to make anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's trip was an unusual part of the procession of
political hopefuls who come to court New Hampshire voters and power
brokers.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the presumptive presidential candidates, like former
Vice President Dan Quayle, Vice President Al Gore and the House
minority leader, Dick Gephardt, make frequent visits to the Granite
State. Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee sponsors an annual lobster
bake in New Hampshire for several hundred of the state's political
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman went to considerable lengths to emphasize her
oft-repeated contention that she is not interested in, and has not
done any of the political organizing or fund-raising necessary to
mount, a serious presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   Although Whitman was widely mentioned as a possible presidential
candidate several years ago, many political analysts said that the
increased power of the Republican Party's right wing meant she
would be rejected because of her support for abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the overwhelmingly Republican crowd at the Nashua
Chamber of Commerce received her warmly, and Mike Valuk, the
president of the chamber, said she was highly regarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's a very attractive leader, she's got panache,''
he said. ``She's a woman, she's got an impressive record and I
don't think voters here or around the country will vote on the
basis of one issue.''
</P>
<P>
   After delivering a routine address about tax cuts and education
reform in Nashua, Whitman went on the offensive during the Harvard
speech, using it as a platform to outline her differences with
national Republican leaders and women's groups.
</P>
<P>
   She denounced the national Republican strategy devised by House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, which has sought to motivate conservative
voters by running television commercials about the Clinton scandal.
Whitman, who has traveled extensively around the country during the
last two months, said voters were ``sick and tired of hearing the
lurid details about the mess in the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman then described how the scandal had weakened Americans'
trust in political leaders and exposed the hypocrisy of many
women's organizations. Whitman said she has been stunned by the
``deafening silence'' that the Clinton scandal had received from
the same feminist groups who bitterly, and vocally, opposed the
Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas, the former Oregon Sen. Bob
Packwood and other Republicans who have been accused of sexual
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said she decided to speak out against the women's groups
earlier this month when she heard Eleanor Smeal, leader of the
Feminist Majority, an advocacy group, urge women to vote for Rep.
Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois not because of the congresswoman's
qualifications but because she would protect Clinton from possible
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, I've put my money where my mouth is with my
active support of feminist groups,'' said Whitman, who estimates
she has given $5,000 to various women's organizations during the
last decade. ``I have to tell you, I've written my last check _ at
least until they regain their voices and stand up for what they
believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Smeal, who is also a director of the National
Organization for Women, said Whitman had misrepresented the
response of feminist groups to the Jones case and the Lewinsky
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've said all along that we deplore the president's actions,
but don't think they rise to the level of an impeachable offense,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Whitman's aides portrayed the speeches as part of a
policy trip and a chance to campaign for the Republican candidate
for governor in Massachusetts, political analysts say that Whitman
carefully chose themes that would keep her national political
profile high, strengthen her claim on the party's moderate wing and
placate some members of the conservative wing.

 GOVERNOR TELLS HER PARTY SHE WON'T SEEK PRESIDENCY

<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Traveling through the state that will hold
the first presidential primary in the year 2000, Gov. Christie
Whitman of New Jersey told a group of New Hampshire Republicans on
Thursday that she had no intention of seeking her party's
nomination for president.
</P>
<P>
   But in her comments to reporters, and in a speech she later gave
at Harvard University, Whitman made it clear that she would not
relinquish her role as a nationally recognized leader of the
Republican Party's moderate wing.
</P>
<P>
   On a two-day swing through New England, Whitman criticized her
own party's attempts to make the 1998 congressional election a

A CREDIT-TAKING CLASSIC: D'AMATO ON HOSPITALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (DUPLICATION NOTICE: Also sent in category `p') 
(bl) 
 By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It sounds like Santa Claus ticking off last year's gift list as
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato goes hopping around the hustings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fought for and delivered $2.6 billion for our hospitals,''
the New York Republican said in a statement released during a
campaign appearance in Setauket, N.Y., on Thursday and in nearly
every stump speech. He has a custom-made price tag for most stops:
$18.7 million for Nassau County Medical Center, $2 million for Rome
Hospital, $14.5 million for St. Joseph's in Syracuse, $9.2 million
for Nyack Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   In a campaign consumed with calling names and counting missed
votes, little attention has been paid to the claims that candidates
make each day on the trail. But a closer look at the hospital money
reveals a classic case of political credit-taking.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, a review of recent history shows, D'Amato must share
credit with, among others, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, New York
City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, various hospital lobbyists and, most
of all, the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   With a fat total that can easily be chopped into neat
geographical chunks, the issue lends itself to long days on the
campaign plane: the speech stays the same, just the numbers change
with the scenery. While not untrue, the claims exaggerate D'Amato's
influence.
</P>
<P>
   They also imply an infusion of new money when, in fact, what was
at stake was funds that the federal government said New York state
owed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're trying to make your accomplishment relevant to people,
so they'll know, yes, you helped me in Chenango County or
Westchester County,'' said Maureen Connelly, a campaign consultant
who has worked for both Democrats and Republicans and is not
involved in this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not interested in hearing the long title of the
legislation. You're trying to break it down to the lowest common
denominator: This is what I did, this is what it means to you.
Bam.''
</P>
<P>
   The figures D'Amato cites _ the $2.6 billion total, $374 million
for Long Island, $40.2 million for Rockland County _ refer to a
lengthy battle between New York state, its hospitals and the
federal government over Medicaid calculations that the Supreme
Court ultimately resolved in June.
</P>
<P>
   For years, there was a stalemate, as the Clinton administration
contended that New York imposed more than a dozen illegal taxes on
health-care services, which made the state theoretically liable for
returning as much as $2.6 billion to Washington: The taxes inflated
the cost of Medicaid services, which in turn increased the amount
the state received in federal matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   After years of unsuccessful negotiation between the state and
federal governments, D'Amato _ with help from Moynihan, Democrat
from New York _ wrote an amendment that declared the taxes legal
and absolved the state of responsibility for repaying any of the
Medicaid matching money. Congress passed the amendment as part of
the 1997 budget.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton killed the amendment with one of the first strokes
of his line-item veto pen. And it was only when the Supreme Court
declared the line-item veto unconstitutional four months ago that
the hospitals were actually spared.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had to pay back that money, that would have wrecked the
capacity of a lot of our hospitals to deliver needed services,''
said Kenneth Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital
Association. ``We treated it as a very serious and imminent threat
to the viability of our hospitals.''
</P>
<P>
   Raske said that D'Amato was justified in taking credit, but he
and others added that Moynihan was an equal partner in the fight,
and that New York's entire congressional delegation _ including
Rep. Charles Schumer, D'Amato's Democratic opponent _ helped.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, while D'Amato sponsored the original legislation to help
New York, it was ultimately the lawsuit challenging the line-item
veto that decided the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Moynihan, who joined Giuliani and others in pushing the
lawsuit, D'Amato was uninvolved in the suit, though he did show up
for the victory news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Some on Capitol Hill also question the senator's numbers: $2.6
billion was the total potential liability from 1991 to 1997, but it
was never clear that the federal government actually planned to
collect that much. In fact, last fall, the Clinton administration
ruled that two of New York's health-care taxes were legal, which
some have estimated would have erased as much as $1 billion of the
$2.6 billion liability.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state was at risk for $2.6 billion; how much the federal
government was going to actually recover or try to recover is
anybody's guess,'' said an aide to a Democratic member of Congress,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Whether they would have
settled with the state and accepted half of that, or 10 percent of
that, nobody knows.''
</P>
<P>
   With all the complicated nuances of the Medicaid rules and the
issue's lengthy journey through the legislative and judicial
processes, few have questioned D'Amato's claim.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for Schumer, said Thursday that the
hospital money was not a big issue in the campaign; he offered
instead his own 38-page list of what each hospital in the state
would have lost in Medicare cuts if the Republicans' 1994 budget,
which D'Amato supported, had passed.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bellafiore, a spokesman for D'Amato, shrugged off the
difference between ``delivering'' money and warding off potential
liability. While the $2.6 billion was not, as implied, money coming
into New York hospitals, ``it's like dollars not going out,'' he
said.

KISSING COUSINS WED AFTER 60 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KARINA BLAND  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Edie Steving was just 14 when she kissed her 16-year-old cousin
Vern, her first grown-up, weak-in-the-knees kind of kiss.
</P>
<P>
   Vern Kildow was less impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `That's not the way to kiss. Here's how you do it,' ''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   And he kissed her back.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty years later, the kissing cousins were married in Sun City
West on Thursday night, with Steving taking Kildow's last name, the
same one she was given at birth.
</P>
<P>
   He kisses her, and her knees still go weak.
</P>
<P>
   Such a marriage would have been illegal in Arizona until 1990,
when legislators passed a law allowing first cousins to marry if
they are at least 65 years old. Vern turned 77 Thursday, and Edie
is 74.
</P>
<P>
   Edie and Vern's fathers were brothers. The newlyweds look alike
_ the same cheekbones, the same long, tapered fingers, the same
ringing laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we decide we need a kiss at the same instant, too,'' Edie
says.
</P>
<P>
   They've known each other since they were youngsters, ages 4 and
6. Vern was born in Monmouth, Iowa; she was born about 50 miles
away in Waterloo.
</P>
<P>
   It was when Vern ran away from home at the age of 16 and stayed
with Edie's family in Albuquerque that Edie got her kissing lesson.
</P>
<P>
   But Vern went home to his family a month later, and Edie got
married at the age of 16 and had two children, Richard and Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   Edie admits to the huge crush she had on Vern as a teenager, but
says she knew they could not get married back then. They both
wanted to have children someday and knew they could not have them
together.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they've never doubted that they belong with each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always been kissing cousins,'' Edie says.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Vern moved to Colorado Springs, and he, too, married. He and
his wife had seven children: five boys and two girls.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the years, Edie and Vern saw each other at the
occasional family gathering, hugging and kissing each time.
</P>
<P>
   After 55 years of marriage, Vern's wife died of a heart attack
two years ago. Edie's husband died in May. They had been married
for 58 years.
</P>
<P>
   Vern, who was living in Mesa, came to the funeral. It was the
first time Edie and Vern had seen each other in six years.
</P>
<P>
   They went to lunch the next Thursday. And the next. And the
next. They started going to church together and to the movies.
</P>
<P>
   Edie made the first move again, proposing to Vern in
mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   He was at her house, talking about something. She can't remember
what. But she remembers thinking, ``I have to have this man in my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Vern said yes, but to make it official _ two weeks later _ he
dropped to one knee near her chair and asked Edie to marry him.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't even hesitate,'' Vern says.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, states have passed laws against marriages between
first cousins to prevent offspring that would likely suffer from
genetic defects and a plethora of medical problems. But many states
have changed those laws, allowing first cousins to wed if they are
too old to have children, or in some cases even if they aren't.
</P>
<P>
   Edie says they aren't planning to have any.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, dear, not at our age,'' she says, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Edie's engagement ring is a royal blue gemstone with triangles
of cubic zirconia on each side. Vern bought it for her at
Nordstrom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need to spend a lot of money on expensive jewelry at
our age,'' Edie says, showing it off proudly. It is her favorite
color.
</P>
<P>
   Their wedding rings are simple gold bands.
</P>
<P>
   Vern moved to Sun City West from Mesa last week. On Thursday,
they decorated the back yard _ with the help of Vern's son, Joe _
with pink, white and turquoise blue streamers. Crepe-paper bells
hang above the sliding glass door.
</P>
<P>
   Vern's oldest son, Jeff, flew in from Colorado as well as
Richard, Edie's son. Richard Steving walked his mother down the
aisle and handed her over to Vern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard her giggling like a little girl, haven't seen
her so happy for many years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They planned for about 50 guests who sat on folding chairs, some
borrowed from neighbors. There were two cakes _ one for Vern's
birthday, the other for their wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``See what I'm getting for my birthday,'' Vern says, smiling at
Edie. They both laugh.
</P>
<P>
   She is wearing a linen turquoise blue dress, he a blazer and
royal blue and turquoise tie. They make a dashing couple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I could live without him,'' Edie says.
</P>
<P>
   The couple plan to honeymoon in Albuquerque, the place where
that first kiss took place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't get enough loving and kissing,'' Edie says, leaning
over to Vern for a soft, long kiss.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would think we were teenagers,'' Vern says. &QL;

said Kenneth Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital
Association. ``We treated it as a very serious and imminent threat
to the viability of our hospitals.''
</P>
<P>
   Raske said that D'Amato was justified in taking credit, but he
and others added that Moynihan was an equal partner in the fight,
and that New York's entire congressional delegation _ including
Rep. Charles Schumer, D'Amato's Democratic opponent _ helped.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, while D'Amato sponsored the original legislation to help
New York, it was ultimately the lawsuit challenging the line-item
veto that decided the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Moynihan, who joined Giuliani and others in pushing the
lawsuit, D'Amato was uninvolved in the suit, though he did show up
for the victory news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Some on Capitol Hill also question the senator's numbers: $2.6
billion was the total potential liability from 1991 to 1997, but it
was never clear that the federal government actually planned to
collect that much. In fact, last fall, the Clinton administration
ruled that two of New York's health-care taxes were legal, which
some have estimated would have erased as much as $1 billion of the
$2.6 billion liability.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state was at risk for $2.6 billion; how much the federal
government was going to actually recover or try to recover is
anybody's guess,'' said an aide to a Democratic member of Congress,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Whether they would have
settled with the state and accepted half of that, or 10 percent of
that, nobody knows.''
</P>
<P>
   With all the complicated nuances of the Medicaid rules and the
issue's lengthy journey through the legislative and judicial
processes, few have questioned D'Amato's claim.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for Schumer, said Thursday that the
hospital money was not a big issue in the campaign; he offered
instead his own 38-page list of what each hospital in the state
would have lost in Medicare cuts if the Republicans' 1994 budget,
which D'Amato supported, had passed.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bellafiore, a spokesman for D'Amato, shrugged off the
difference between ``delivering'' money and warding off potential
liability. While the $2.6 billion was not, as implied, money coming
into New York hospitals, ``it's like dollars not going out,'' he
said.

MCCAIN WIDENING FUND-RAISING BASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With his re-election virtually guaranteed, Arizona Sen. John
McCain is focusing on building a national fund-raising network that
could provide the backbone for a presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has tapped GOP donors from Orange County, Calif., to New
York, raising nearly $1.5 million from out-of-state contributors,
including Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates; real estate tycoon Donald
Trump; Time-Warner Vice Chairman Ted Turner; and the heads of
Revlon, CBS and NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Out-of-state contributors constitute about 51 percent of
McCain's individual donor base; an additional $1.4 million comes
from Arizona supporters.
</P>
<P>
   It's a potent portfolio that could help McCain in the first test
of strength in the 2000 GOP presidential primary _ a candidate's
ability to stack up broad support from the party's financial
backers.
</P>
<P>
   But if McCain decides to make a run for the White House, he'll
have to work a lot harder, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made the right start, but if he's serious, he will have
to accelerate these (fund-raising) efforts enormously and very
quickly,'' said Larry Sabato, director of governmental studies at
the University of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``A serious candidate will have to have a minimum of $20 million
to $30 million by the end of 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year will be a crucial test.
</P>
<P>
   A study by GOP fund-raising consultant Stan Huckaby indicates
that since 1976, the candidate who raises the most money in the
year before the primaries has always won the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Huckaby estimates a successful candidate will have to sweep
together $21 million next year.
</P>
<P>
   If he decides to run, McCain likely will have $2 million left
over from Tuesday's election, which could be used to seed a
presidential bid. There is little drama to the race _ McCain had a
6-1 lead over Democrat Ed Ranger in an ``Arizona Republic'' poll
early in October.
</P>
<P>
   McCain this week repeated that he has not made a decision about
his future. Ranger, though, believes McCain has written off his
re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. McCain's strategic plan does not include the Senate race.
It's a run for the presidency,'' Ranger said. ``I think it's
extremely transparent. Most people I talk to throughout the state
aren't fooled.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said the chief consideration behind his aggressive fund-
raising this year was to be prepared for another potential attack
by the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   In July, tobacco companies spent about $40 million, including $1
million in Arizona, on an unprecedented national lobbying blitz
against McCain and his tobacco legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The experience left the senator highly wary that tobacco
executives _ people he calls ``despicable and terrible'' _ would
target him on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told indirectly they were contemplating such a thing,''
McCain said. ``That was my reason for trying to raise money.''
</P>
<P>
   But a second attack by tobacco interests has yet to appear,
leaving McCain virtually untouched during this year's nearly
invisible U.S. Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   That gives the senator plenty of time to focus on fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, McCain was in Orange County rubbing shoulders
with a group of California's high-rollers at an event hosted by
development tycoon George Argyros.
</P>
<P>
   While the reception raised $25,000 for McCain's campaign, its
significance could be even greater in the future. Argyros could be
a top lieutenant in McCain's battle for the wallets of GOP donors.
</P>
<P>
   Argyros, who has played major roles in GOP state and national
campaigns, is chairman of Team California, a GOP fund-raising group
that tries to tap into California's wealthiest donors.
</P>
<P>
   McCain aides said the senator and Argyros serve together on the
board of the Nixon Center, a bipartisan public policy institution.
</P>
<P>
   Their relationship illustrates the broad network McCain has
built through his tireless work with Republican parties, candidates
and activists across the nation. As his national profile rises, so
does the demand for his services as a GOP campaigner and
fund-raiser, the senator's aides said.
</P>
<P>
   And when McCain raises money for a candidate or party in another
state, he often sandwiches in an event for his own campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have raised money in the majority of the major cities
around the country, and Senator McCain has been extremely
well-received,'' McCain state director Deb Gullett said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also has hired a national fund-raising consultant, Carla
Eudy, who raised money for GOP Texas Sen. Phil Gramm's 1996
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of itemized contributions, those of $200 or more,
indicates that McCain's greatest success has been in New York,
California, Texas and Colorado. In New York, where former Secretary
of State Henry Kissinger hosted a fund-raiser for the senator last
year, McCain raised more than $150,000. He raised slightly more
than $100,000 in each of the other three states.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's success also stems from his leadership of the Senate
Commerce Committee, which puts him at the center of issues
affecting the telecommunications and television industries.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Solomon Trujillo, US West Communications
president and chief executive, hosted a fund-raising reception for
McCain at his Colorado home that raised $25,000. In all, 55 US West
executives from Colorado, where the company has its headquarters,
have donated to McCain's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Also in Colorado, U.S. Olympic Committee Chairman William Hybl,
a longtime McCain friend, helped the senator raise funds.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the entertainment industry, McCain's donor list
reads like a Who's Who in television, including CBS top executives
Michael Jordan and Mel Karmazin; NBC President and Chief Executive
Robert Wright; and executives with A&AMP;E Entertainment Network,
Showtime Networks and the Sundance Channel.
</P>
<P>
   A McCain spokeswoman said this week that the senator welcomes
support from the businesses he regulates, but that their
contributions have no bearing on his decisions. &QL;

CAVONNIER'S ABSENCE WON'T SPOIL THE PARTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ Saturday's California Cup races at Santa Anita
lost their marquee horse Thursday when Cavonnier was withdrawn from
the Classic because of an injury.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of one star is unlikely to affect the popularity of
the Cal Cup, the 10-race card for Cal-bred horses that has drawn
between 28,000 and 40,000 every year since its 1990 debut.
</P>
<P>
   Cavonnier's injury is described as minor and in the left hind
leg, not the right foreleg, where he suffered the tendon injury
that has sidelined him for nearly 2{ years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We noticed it when we schooled him in the paddock
(Wednesday),'' said Eoin Harty, assistant to trainer Bob Baffert.
``We jogged him this morning and he was definitely off.''
</P>
<P>
   The '96 Santa Anita Derby winner, second to Grindstone in the
closest Kentucky Derby in 28 years, was pulled up in the Belmont
Stakes and has undergone a new tendon treatment at owners Bob and
Barbara Walter's ranch in Sebastapol, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   This leaves the $250,000 Classic with six horses and
handicappers with a harder job now that they can't bet against 9-5
morning-line favorite Cavonnier. The new favorite is likely to be
Budroyale, but the field includes Pacificbounty (third in the
Pacific Classic), Bagshot (second in the Santa Anita Handicap) and
tough old Kingdom Found.
</P>
<P>
   A better bet is that the Cal Cup will be one of the highlights
of the local racing year, relying as usual on full fields (five
races have 10 horses or more), familiar faces (five Cal Cup winners
return) and a party atmosphere. And this year, the attraction
includes a track-guaranteed $2 million pool in the pick-six.
</P>
<P>
   The card starts at noon with three starter-handicap races for
Cal-breds. Here's a look at the other Cal Cup stakes, each with a
$125,000 purse, except for the $175,000 Mile:
</P>
<P>
   __Matron: The 1 1/16-mile turf race for fillies and mares will
be run as the fourth race, keeping odds-on favorite Magical Allure
out of the pick-six, which starts with the fifth. Magical Allure is
unbeaten in six starts and could have faced Sharp Cat and Banshee
Breeze in the Nov. 7 Breeders' Cup Distaff at Churchill Downs.
Instead, she'll tower over Supercillious and rusty Belle's Flag.
</P>
<P>
   __Distaff: There are no Magical Allures in the fillies and mares
turf sprint. Instead, there's a deep list of contenders, including
Seattle Carla, seeking her first victory since the '97 Distaff;
Career Collection, seeking her first victory since the '97 Juvenile
Fillies, and Spirited Jacklyn, assigned a race-high 120 pounds
after getting over her seconditis.
</P>
<P>
   __Juvenile: The 2-year-old males' race, won by Cavonnier in '95,
provides little competition for nine-length Cal Sires Stakes winner
Proud Louie now that Daring General has been pointed for the
Breeders' Cup Juvenile.
</P>
<P>
   __Sprint: Red hasn't won since his '97 Sprint victory, and he's
in for a rough one against Big Jag, Crimson Look and Devoted
Pirate, the 1-2-5 finishers in the fast Cal Sprint Championship up
north, and Surachai, in the money in 8 of 9 at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   __Mile: Gimpy-kneed Uncaged Fury will try the turf Mile and is
co-highweight (120) with Native Desert. ``I know it's a big field
(14 horses) in the Mile and a lot can happen,'' trainer Lewis
Cenicola said. ``But he's a little older (7) now, and going a mile
he'll have a little more time to regroup if he makes a mistake.''
Native Desert is a typical Cal Cup story, a former $32,000 claimer
who's won six stakes in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   __Juvenile Fillies: Gary Stevens, who rides 6-for-6 Magical
Allure in the Matron, also has 3-for-3 Controlled for trainer Eddie
Gregson in this race. The daughter of In Excess already has shown
the ability to win from on and off the pace.
</P>
<P>
   __The weekend: Sunday's Oak Tree Derby is expected to match
Ladies Din, the Del Mar Derby winner, and Dr Fong, a European
reported to have been sold for $8 million before coming to Neil
Drysdale's barn here.
</P>
<P>
   __Series announced: The National Thoroughbred Racing Association
unveiled a 10-race series for handicap-division horses that will
debut in 1999 and be televised by Fox. It'll start with the Jan. 30
Donn Handicap at Gulfstream Park in Florida and end with the Aug.
29 Pacific Classic at Del Mar and include the March 6 Santa Anita
Handicap and June 27 Hollywood Gold Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Points will be assigned to top-three finishers and a cash prize
of yet-to-be-determined size awarded to the owners of the series
winner. The series will visit six states and the schedule will make
it difficult for any horse to enter more than half the races. ``It
doesn't purport to be the Horse of the Year (contest) or the
championship of the division,'' said NTRA commissioner Tim Smith.
</P>
<P>
   __Post time: Secretariat is among 15 ``enduring symbols of the
1970s'' to be honored with U.S. postage stamps starting next fall.
The Postal Service held a public vote, and the '73 Triple Crown
winner finished No. 14 overall, and No. 3 in the sports category
behind ``Monday Night Football'' and the Pittsburgh Steelers.

LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF SHERMAN BLOCK DIES AT 74
</HEADLINE>
 (With BC-LA-BLOCK-REACTION-LADN; both for use by NYTimes News
Service clients) 
BY LEE CONDON AND DOUGLAS HABERMAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block, who
died Thursday night with his wife Alyce by his side, was a former
delicatessen counterman who rose the ranks to become the county's
top lawman for 16 years. He was 74.
</P>
<P>
   Block, who insisted on seeking a fifth term despite his age and
serious health problems, slipped and hit his head last Saturday at
his home in the suburban Los Angeles community of West Hills, in a
fall that doctors say was caused by a massive blood clot in his
brain. After four hours of surgery Monday, Block never regained
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   During 16 years in charge, Block guided the modernization and
expansion of the sheriff's department, now the nation's largest. He
also faced allegations of mismanagement and of wrongdoing by
officers, which he used as catalysts for reform, establishing
community policing, random drug testing for employees and extensive
cultural sensitivity training.
</P>
<P>
   Block was elected four times, including in 1986 when he took 84
percent of the vote. This year, however, Lee Baca, a 32-year
department veteran, forced Block into his first-ever runoff by
finishing a close second in the June primary.
</P>
<P>
   Block twice overcame cancer, undergoing successful surgery in
1991 for prostate cancer and in 1993 undergoing chemotherapy
suffering lymphoma.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, he suffered kidney failure, requiring him to
undergo dialysis three days a week.
</P>
<P>
   ```I believe I will know better than anyone else when it's time
for me to say adios,'' Block said in an interview a few years ago.
``I don't want to ever be remembered as a guy who stayed around too
long.'' A Chicago transplant, Block loved to tell the story of how
he became a Los Angeles lawman.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be a cop, you have to want to be a cop,'' Block said. ``You
don't go into law enforcement because you're looking for a job. It
not only involves you, it involves your entire family.''
</P>
<P>
   As he told the story, he was working at a Fairfax Avenue
delicatessen in the 1950s when a police officer stopped him for a
traffic offense -- and didn't ask for a bribe, unlike some Chicago
officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so impressed by his demeanor and that contact, (that)
when I got home I woke my wife up to tell her because it was really
a new experience,'' Block said. ``And I began talking about going
into law enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Block was 32 in 1956 when he passed a written test at Fairfax
High School and completed a six-week academy training. Married and
a father of two, Block gave up making sandwiches, which he'd been
doing for three years.
</P>
<P>
   Block had not completed a college education upon his entry into
the department, but while on the job he earned a bachelor's degree
in police science and administration from California State
University, Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   After working in the records, vice and intelligence bureaus,
Block was made chief of corrections. From there, he was promoted to
assistant sheriff and supervised the patrol, detective and
administrative operations of the department.
</P>
<P>
   When Sheriff Peter Pitchess readied for retirement in 1981, he
said he would step aside only if Block, then the undersheriff, was
appointed as his successor by the Board of Supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1982, Block was sworn in as sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   Block easily won his first election later that year and
re-election four years later.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the department was rocked by revelations of corruption
involving 10 deputies in the narcotics unit, yet Block's personal
popularity remained strong, getting two-thirds of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of controversial shootings by deputies early in
his third term, Block agreed under pressure to allow an outside
commission of experts led by retired Judge James Kolts to look at
ways to reduce brutality complaints and litigation and other
problems in the department.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting report that came out in 1992 found ``deeply
disturbing evidence of excessive force and lax discipline'' within
his department.
</P>
<P>
   The report praised Block personally for his ``openness to change
and flexibility,'' but it questioned his claim of direct
accountability to the public and the weak leadership shown by the
county Board of Supervisors in overseeing the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sheriff has no real boss,'' the report said. ``The truth
is that the sheriff runs his own department as he alone sees fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics also pointed to a number of lawsuits alleging that
deputies at the Lynwood station engaged in brutality against
minorities and were affiliated with a white-supremacist gang.
</P>
<P>
   Block defended his agency, but acknowledged problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be highly unlikely that in an organization of this
size . . . that we don't have any people who harbor racial
prejudices and other kinds of bigoted tendencies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tenacious as always, Block won his fourth term in 1994 and it
was only because of his age and ill health that he appeared
electorally vulnerable this year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the problems, he had a strong record of progress in
running the 14,000-member law enforcement agency: service-oriented
policing, random drug testing, cultural awareness training, three
additional weeks of academy training and an Office of Professional
and Ethical Standards.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, the department has established new guidelines
that require every deputy who is present when force is used to
report the incident.
</P>
<P>
   A months-long disciplinary process has been discarded and unit
commanders have the authority to administer discipline up to and
including 15-day suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   More than a year before community-based policing was introduced
within the LAPD, Block had instituted his own version of it by
combining the concerns of the community with traditional law
enforcement tactics.
</P>
<P>
   A tougher decision for the sheriff was bringing random drug
testing to his department more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, I have been an opponent of random drug testing, and
my people knew it,' Block said recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I then went 180 degrees. I felt the community needed to be
reassured that the men and women of this department who are out
there providing their law enforcement services are in fact drug
free.'
</P>
<P>
   He was among the first to be tested. He took pride in his own
rise through the ranks and the step by step progress made in the
department over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been my philosophy that you go for that which is
realistically attainable,'' he said not long ago. ``That way, you
have the confidence to go to the next step.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Alyce; a son, Barry, who is a nurse;
a daughter, Barbara, a Los Angeles County sheriff's lieutenant, and
a grandson, Matthew, 12.

a father of two, Block gave up making sandwiches, which he'd been
doing for three years.
</P>
<P>
   Block had not completed a college education upon his entry into
the department, but while on the job he earned a bachelor's degree
in police science and administration from California State
University, Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   After working in the records, vice and intelligence bureaus,
Block was made chief of corrections. From there, he was promoted to
assistant sheriff and supervised the patrol, detective and
administrative operations of the department.
</P>
<P>
   When Sheriff Peter Pitchess readied for retirement in 1981, he
said he would step aside only if Block, then the undersheriff, was
appointed as his successor by the Board of Supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1982, Block was sworn in as sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   Block easily won his first election later that year and
re-election four years later.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the department was rocked by revelations of corruption
involving 10 deputies in the narcotics unit, yet Block's personal
popularity remained strong, getting two-thirds of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of controversial shootings by deputies early in
his third term, Block agreed under pressure to allow an outside
commission of experts led by retired Judge James Kolts to look at
ways to reduce brutality complaints and litigation and other
problems in the department.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting report that came out in 1992 found ``deeply
disturbing evidence of excessive force and lax discipline'' within
his department.
</P>
<P>
   The report praised Block personally for his ``openness to change
and flexibility,'' but it questioned his claim of direct
accountability to the public and the weak leadership shown by the
county Board of Supervisors in overseeing the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sheriff has no real boss,'' the report said. ``The truth
is that the sheriff runs his own department as he alone sees fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics also pointed to a number of lawsuits alleging that
deputies at the Lynwood station engaged in brutality against
minorities and were affiliated with a white-supremacist gang.
</P>
<P>
   Block defended his agency, but acknowledged problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be highly unlikely that in an organization of this
size . . . that we don't have any people who harbor racial
prejudices and other kinds of bigoted tendencies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tenacious as always, Block won his fourth term in 1994 and it
was only because of his age and ill health that he appeared
electorally vulnerable this year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the problems, he had a strong record of progress in
running the 14,000-member law enforcement agency: service-oriented
policing, random drug testing, cultural awareness training, three
additional weeks of academy training and an Office of Professional
and Ethical Standards.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, the department has established new guidelines
that require every deputy who is present when force is used to
report the incident.
</P>
<P>
   A months-long disciplinary process has been discarded and unit
commanders have the authority to administer discipline up to and
including 15-day suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   More than a year before community-based policing was introduced
within the LAPD, Block had instituted his own version of it by
combining the concerns of the community with traditional law
enforcement tactics.
</P>
<P>
   A tougher decision for the sheriff was bringing random drug
testing to his department more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, I have been an opponent of random drug testing, and
my people knew it,' Block said recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I then went 180 degrees. I felt the community needed to be
reassured that the men and women of this department who are out
there providing their law enforcement services are in fact drug
free.'
</P>
<P>
   He was among the first to be tested. He took pride in his own
rise through the ranks and the step by step progress made in the
department over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been my philosophy that you go for that which is
realistically attainable,'' he said not long ago. ``That way, you
have the confidence to go to the next step.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Alyce; a son, Barry, who is a nurse;
a daughter, Barbara, a Los Angeles County sheriff's lieutenant, and
a grandson, Matthew, 12.

DETECTIVES INVESTIGATING INMATE'S DEATH AT L.A. JAIL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LEE CONDON AND YVETTE CABRERA  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Sheriff's homicide detectives on Thursday began
investigating the death of a 34-year-old inmate at the downtown
Twin Towers Correctional Facility. The death was the fifth among
inmates and trustees in the county jails department in the last
three months.
</P>
<P>
   One death has been ruled homicide, and the others are either
under investigation or have been ruled justifiable uses of force by
deputies or due to natural causes.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Eric G. Ferrer, who has filed a lawsuit against the Los
Angeles County Sheriff's Department on behalf of an inmate
allegedly beaten to death &UR;  &LR; in 1997, called for an outside
investigation to put an end to what he called a culture within the
department that allows brutalities to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about deaths, homicides, killings of human
beings,'' said Ferrer. ``Civil judgment awards simply aren't enough
to put a stop to this conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest death occurred Wednesday when, according to Deputy
John McBride, a cellmate of the inmate discovered that he was not
breathing and notified jail staff, who attempted to revive him.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Carrie Stuart said the department is investigating the
death but will not know if it was a homicide until receiving a
report back from the coroner.
</P>
<P>
   The man, who was not identified pending notification of
relatives, was housed in a cell with three other inmates. He had
been arrested Feb. 24 for taking a vehicle without the owner's
consent.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, an inmate at Twin Towers was found unconscious in his
cell and later died after being taken to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 21, a psychiatric patient, who repeatedly slammed his
head into the side of a stucco wall following a fight with a male
nurse at a board-and-care facility, died after sheriff's deputies
restrained him.
</P>
<P>
   The coroner confirmed that the Aug. 1 death of Twin Towers
inmate Danny Ray Smith was a homicide, although a pre-existing
heart condition contributed to his death. Smith had been involved
in an altercation with deputies, and the FBI is investigating his
death. The FBI started its investigation after another inmate was
beaten allegedly by a ``posse'' of renegade deputies.

A HERO OPENS EYES AND HEARTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID LEIBOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the days before liftoff, the days before I get it, America's
latest spectacle impresses me not at all.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Every newscast spotlights the elderly astronaut's full-moonish
dome; every slow-motion glimpse of him makes me zap the channel.
Certain catchwords _ space, pioneer, hero, hero, hero _ echo
culturewide. I practice selective deafness, then fight the hype
with a mantra.
</P>
<P>
   John Glenn is no hero.
</P>
<P>
   Not now, I think at first, not for this $422 million victory lap
around the globe. Glenn's second voyage is admirable, yes, and
poignant, but for me his trip aboard the Discovery lacks the
primary component of heroism.
</P>
<P>
   Circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Circumstances are what every hero overcomes, I tell myself, what
separates the adventurous _ Glenn in his shuttle seat _ from those
ignoring sure death _ a fighter jock in the midst of war. Heroism
depends on dire odds, on facing down an evil no one else would.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a firefighter in a flame-engulfed building, or a
Samaritan diving after a body in an icy river. Think saving, not
spending. Helping, not hyping.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, by contrast, had merely won some outer-space lottery,
mostly by virtue of politics, PR value and connections.
</P>
<P>
   He is the costliest payload ever sent into orbit, a
half-billion-dollar NASA commercial. For once, a ``New York Times''
editorial seemed to hit it just so:
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something a little sad _ even desperate _ about all
the hoopla surrounding this otherwise unremarkable flight. It is as
if a nation that no longer has Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa to cheer
on seems determined to wallow in nostalgia as Glenn and NASA try to
rekindle past glories.'' &QL; 
WRONG, WRONG, WRONG
</P>
<P>
   Wallow we did, all the way onto the launch pad at Cape
Canaveral. The countdown began, and again I said it to myself.
</P>
<P>
   John Glenn is no hero.
</P>
<P>
   And I was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Utterly wrong. Wrong with a smallness of spirit I find
embarrassing to admit _ but what the heck. If a 77-year-old man can
rocket back into myth, a 33-year-old columnist/fool can cop to
stupidity.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly a heroic gesture. At least compared with Glenn's.
</P>
<P>
   This I glimpsed at T minus 10 seconds, and knew for sure within
nine minutes _ all the time it took the Discovery to gain orbit.
All the time it took to stop a nation cold.
</P>
<P>
   He flew. We watched. Together.
</P>
<P>
   Of such things we fashion heroes.
</P>
<P>
   The circumstances John Glenn overcame were not mortally
dangerous, just mightily daunting. I stand by the earlier
nitpicking: Too much hype, too little science, too many dollars.
All true, yes, but beside the point.
</P>
<P>
   We watched by the million, or listened, or silently prayed. For
a moment, in 50 states fractured by indifference, ideology, skin
color, we blinked in unison.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the sky. At John Glenn arcing into history. &QL; 
ALONG FOR THE RIDE
</P>
<P>
   Briefly, it wasn't five days before an election, or time to
lament an NBA season lost, not a moment to whittle the president
ever smaller, or titter over the scandal ``du jour.'' There was
just Glenn becoming a speck on the horizon, and 270 million souls
along for the ride.
</P>
<P>
   Best news all year.
</P>
<P>
   To deny this would be as small of spirit as Glenn is large of
heart. To deny him his due _ the word hero _ is to demean the
dictionary:
</P>
<P>
   ``hero (n.) _ any person, especially a man, admired for courage,
nobility or exploits, especially in war.''
</P>
<P>
   If the space boot fits . . .
</P>
<P>
   I told myself this while staring at a TV, at a mob staring at
Glenn. The moment was too soon over. We go our separate ways,
change the channel, exhale. We go back to orbiting whatever it is
we value, even as the hero orbits us.
</P>
<P>
   In the crowd, a boy held up a sign. He had the sentiment
backward.
</P>
<P>
   Godspeed, John Glenn, it read. Godspeed, America, it should have
read. We need the luck more. &QL;

GIULIANI, RIORDAN TRADE GENTLE BARBS OVER TITLE TO NATION'S NO. 1
CITY
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: Retransmitting to correct spelling of Giuliani in headline) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Mayor Richard Riordan declared Thursday that he's
the rock 'n' roll mayor while his cross country rival New York
Mayor Rudy Giuliani simply lives in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting in Los Angeles to endorse a gubernatorial candidate,
Riordan reminded Giuliani that the City of Angels won back the
Grammy Awards this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him when he lost the Grammys to us that it was right
since he didn't really appreciate the music,'' Riordan said during
a news conference. ``The last popular music he heard was from
Nelson Eddy and Jeanette McDonald. I like Axl Rose and Courtney
Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so, insisted Giuliani. It's just that he has different
tastes in music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like opera,'' Giuliani said. ``I was probably the only one
awake when they gave out the classical music awards.''
</P>
<P>
   It was one of many such pointed exchanges while the mayors
announced their support for Attorney General Dan Lungren for
California governor in the race against Lt. Gov. Gray Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Introducing Giuliani during a news conference downtown at Parker
Center, Riordan noted that ``he is the mayor of the second-best
city in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Countered Giuliani, ``It's nice to be in the city that's number
. . . It's nice to be in Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Giuliani said, he and Riordan have more in common
than most think.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're both Republican mayors of big cities who have made
dramatic changes,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1993, when we were both first elected, we were on `Meet the
Press' together and (host) Tim Russert threw a bunch of questions
at us and we agreed on every one -- and we hadn't even talked about
any of it before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Giuliani noted, Riordan is an ex-New Yorker governing a
city that many ex-New Yorkers now call home.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Riordan was in New York as part of a campaign
to attract capital from that city's financial district to help
California firms.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the New Los Angeles Marketing Partnership
group waged a $100,000 advertising campaign in New York newspapers,
touting the city of Los Angeles. The ads showed a red apple turning
green, with the message: ``New York was turning green with envy.''
</P>
<P>
   An embarrassed Riordan tried to soften that attack, saying
Giuliani was responsible ``for making the Big Apple shinier and
redder.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's trip to Los Angeles is part of a nationwide swing he
has been making on behalf of Republican opponents around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The New York mayor said he has known Lungren for 18 years and
believed it was important to speak on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how much weight the endorsement of a New York
mayor has, but it is important to elect Dan Lungren,'' Giuliani
said. ``He will be good for California and good for the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Riordan said his backing of Lungren was based on his belief the
attorney general would provide strong support for public safety
programs as well as help push change in the state's education
system.
</P>
<P>
   Also speaking on Lungren's behalf were representatives of the
Crime Victims Memorial Fund.
