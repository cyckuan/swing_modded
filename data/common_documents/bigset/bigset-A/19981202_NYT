NEW BCS SYSTEM AN IMPROVEMENT BUT BUGS REMAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first season of college football's Bowl Championship Series
will conclude Sunday with the naming of teams to the Jan. 4 Fiesta
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes to plan between now and then, the new BCS system
will have killed no one. Let us offer preliminary congratulations.
</P>
<P>
   Not that deaths were expected, but anytime this many of college
football's thinkers agree on a single thing, public safety cannot
be assumed.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there will be emotional casualties, particularly if
the three top unbeaten teams, Tennessee, UCLA and Kansas State,
stay that way after this weekend's final games. Only two of them
will make the Fiesta Bowl, leaving the third to wail pitifully
about injustice and mistreatment.
</P>
<P>
   That's because, despite all the machinations involving polls,
newspapers, computers, quartiles and eye of newt that make up the
BCS rating system, the decision on the two best teams, and more
precisely who the two best teams aren't, still comes down to
somebody's opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it: If form prevails this weekend and UCLA and
Tennessee are selected, who is to say that Kansas State wouldn't
beat either or both?
</P>
<P>
   That annoying question is an annual fixture of the sport, and
the BCS set out to answer it. But unless there's an upset this
weekend, the BCS will whiff on its first at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   The BCS employs a better methodology than its dubious ancestors,
the Bowl Alliance and the Bowl Coalition. And it is certainly an
improvement over the system of less than 10 years ago, when the
bowl selection process made 18th-century piracy look like a picnic
with the Muppets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old system was absolutely the wrong thing for colleges to
be engaged in,'' said Tom Hansen, Pac-10 commissioner and an
architect of the new apparatus. ``It was a cutthroat and
essentially dishonest practice. You couldn't believe anybody about
anything. Now, we still have to compete to sign (bowl) contracts,
but there's no more of this backstabbing and trying to outsell each
other in bowl tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest change that made the BCS the best system so far was
the decision of the Pac-10 and Big Ten to surrender their
exclusive, lucrative contract with the Rose Bowl in order to make
the game and their conferences part of the new show.
</P>
<P>
   The Pac-10 ``realized at some point that the coalition and
alliance weren't working in the best interests of the game without
us,'' Hansen said. ``It wasn't clean, regardless of how beneficial
our Rose Bowl arrangement was to the two conferences. The Big Ten
especially felt roundly criticized and said it was hurting the
schools in recruiting. Other schools would say if you go to a Big
Ten school, you can only play in the Rose Bowl and not the national
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Pac-10 caved. Still, a few days shy of conclusion, Hansen
is pleased with the BCS's first year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's worked for the better,'' he said. ``The system
responds to games played and has movement, rather than locking
teams into position (under the old poll system). Strength of
schedule has become a major factor, as we had hoped.''
</P>
<P>
   All true. Unfortunately, the BCS simply doesn't go far enough.
Besides being mis-named _ it is not a series, nor is it a true
championship because the final-game berths are invitations unearned
via playoffs _ the system settles for just two teams and one game.
</P>
<P>
   The various rankings and strength of schedule formulas do
eliminate the chance for travesty, such as in 1984 when BYU was
selected as national poll champion ahead of Washington. But without
a playoff format that includes the top four or eight teams, it's
still guesswork, as it has always been, but no longer is in any
other sport (except for the NFL, where referees are helpless to
distinguish between the words ``heads'' and ``tails'').
</P>
<P>
   Hansen is convinced the BCS isn't likely to accommodate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's worked rather well,'' he said. ``I don't think it
could have happened better or differently if we had changed
anything. If you look at the problems as well as the potential in a
(multi-team) tournament, the answer is no, not with the bowls the
way they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, you'll always get an argument wherever you draw the
selection line, whether it's No. 3 or No. 64'' as with the men's
basketball tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Except that few will care who's No. 65.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a season in which the BCS must choose two from a
half-dozen teams with one loss. The computer-generated
hairsplitting will produce little more satisfaction than the old
method of relying on geography-challenged sportswriters and
time-challenged coaches who turn over their poll ballots to kids in
the office.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, relying on computers for a champion bodes ill. Once
Bill Gates gets back from the Big House and sees that computers are
the foundation of college football, he will purchase the NCAA and
play the entire season on his Macintosh in about a day and a half.
</P>
<P>
   Scoff if you will, but his virtual championship will be no
better or worse than the virtual championship the BCS offers.

LAVIN'S RECRUITS ON SCREAM TEAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Meet Steve Lavin, yeller and screamer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a real fiery guy,'' Bruins guard Rico Hines said. ``When
he wants you to play hard, you knows it's time. He starts foaming
at the mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, and his hair gets messed up,'' forward Travis Reed said.
``The slickness comes down.''
</P>
<P>
   Lavin is far from a raging lunatic and can't match his mentor,
Purdue's Gene Keady, on the emotion meter. But having recruited 12
of the 14 Bruins himself, he's more emphatic this season when
making his point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, it wasn't really his team, it was more like Jim
Harrick's team and he was the stepdad,'' Reed said, referring to
Harrick recruits Toby Bailey, J.R. Henderson and Kris Johnson.
``Now, we're all his players, and that's why he yells at us more.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Kentucky game is any indication, they thrive on tough
love. Lavin was enraged after a 70-54 loss to Maryland and
challenged their manhood, and they responded with their best game
yet, a 66-62 loss to Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can deal with the yelling,'' Hines said. ``Last year, the
three seniors didn't really respond well to yelling. They were
older, and they thought, `Hey, coach is only eight years older than
we are.' We respond better.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis update: Injured guard Baron Davis may be cleared to play
today. Or he may be told to wait another week. Or he may not be
told anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be this week, it could be next week,'' Lavin said.
``We're encouraged and hopeful.''
</P>
<P>
   When he does return, Davis will be on a restricted-minutes
program: 15-20 minutes per game for a few weeks, then 25-30 minutes
for a few weeks, then full clearance.
</P>
<P>
   Can't look back: Freshman forward JaRon Rush is shooting 29.2
percent from the field _ in part because of poor shot selection, in
part because of back spasms that have nagged him for two years.
</P>
<P>
   The spasms often strike when Rush is on the bench, so he rides
an exercise bike to stay loose. He's on a back-strengthening
program, but the flights to and from Puerto Rico were painful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was bothering me, but I had to play through it,'' he said.
``I'm going to rehab it (this week), and I think I'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Fine time for Farnham: Walk-on forward Sean Farnham got a rare
opportunity against Kentucky _ the chance to play with the outcome
in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``When coach Lavin told me I was going in, I turned the
intensity to overload,'' he said. ``I was going to knock somebody
down. From where I've been to where I am, it was nice to
contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   Farnham had one rebound and one turnover in six minutes and
energized the Bruins' bench with his hustle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team was as excited about his one rebound as I ever seen a
team excited about one rebound,'' Lavin said.
</P>

DEMAND SNOWBALLING FOR FUZZY, INTERACTIVE TOY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LEE CONDON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Forget finding Furbys in stores. The action is all
underground trade in newspapers' classified ads, online auction
sites _ and Earl Jacobson's garage, where prices are marked up two,
three or four times and still rising.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson, a resident of suburban North Hollywood, has 200 Furbys
left in the stockpile he started collecting in October and is now
selling the cute, fuzzy, interactive toy-of-the-moment for $150 to
$200 _ well above the retail price of $34.99.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just buying a few here and there. Now it's just
insanity,'' Jacobson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people are bitching about the price. It's going up
every week. We've been selling them to people for $150 and they're
reselling them for more.''
</P>
<P>
   The hottest Furbys _ a rare black-and-white unit _ are fetching
the highest prices, Jacobson said.
</P>
<P>
   Emmett Schoeberl is desperate to get a Furby for the 6-year-old
granddaughter of a close friend who lives in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wants one of those Furbys in the worst way. She cries
every time I talk to her,'' said Schoeberl, 74.
</P>
<P>
   He's hoping to have one in hand by the time he leaves on a trip
to visit his friends Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He stood in line at one store at dawn, but it quickly sold its
supply of 11 Furbys and he left empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   The toys are selling on the Internet, where auction sites like
ebay.com start bidding for the fuzzy toys at $61, though prices
Tuesday topped $100 for many of the more than 200 listings.
</P>
<P>
   A sample Internet advertisement: ``I am looking for a nice
loving home for a young Furby. This incredible pet is of Jewish
heritage and sadly an orphan. Its parents were torn apart by unruly
shoppers at a Toys `R' Us in Southern California. It's a very ugly
story and a sad commentary of holiday shoppers.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Cabbage Patch Kids, which just kind of lay there, and
Tickle Me Elmo, which just giggles a lot, Furby is one serious
high-tech toy. Inspired by the success last year of the virtual pet
toy called Tamagotchi, Tiger Electronics developed the interactive
Furby.
</P>
<P>
   As cute as a Tickle Me Elmo, a Furby has bulging eyes and an
O-shape mouth. They speak a made-up language called ``Furbish,''
can sing songs and can learn up to 200 words of English. The toy
also responds to touch, sound and light.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Giss, a retail expert for the accounting firm of
Deloitte and Touche, said the Furby is a genius stroke of
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've managed to create a shortage mentality,'' Giss said.
``There's no question the shortage is somewhat artificial. When you
create a scarcity you create demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a natural for a black market and an underground to
develop,'' Giss said.
</P>
<P>
   Paula David, a spokeswoman for the California Department of
Consumer Affairs, said people can legally buy and sell Furbys at
any price, as long as they don't represent the product they are
selling as new.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charging what the market will bear is OK. Scalping laws only
apply to tickets,'' David said.
</P>
<P>
   And the open market is where buyers likely will find Furbys.
</P>
<P>
   FAO Schwartz at the Glendale Galleria, north of downtown Los
Angeles, has a waiting list of 1,500 people and they stopped taking
names the first week of October. Stores throughout the San Fernando
Valley are sold out and have no idea when next shipments will come
in, meaning you'll have to get up at dawn each morning and hope
it's your lucky day.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Outz, manager of FAO Schwartz in Glendale, said since
the product only debuted in October, companies like his did not
have a sales track record on Furbys and therefore could not order
as many units as his did this year for other hot sellers like the
dog from the TV show ``Blue's Clues'' or the Teletubbies.
</P>
<P>
   Over at K-B Toys, also in the Glendale Galleria, manager George
Temourian said the store sold out the day after Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are on order. We have no idea when they will come in,''
Temourian said. ``It would be on a first-come, first-served
basis.''

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
CHICAGO _ Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman and the
usual inhabitants of the United Center at this time of year remain
absent because of the hardheadedness on both sides of the NBA
fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the house where championships are rolled off the assembly
line like the latest-model cars was filled Tuesday with the names
of schools that carry pedigrees of success and individuals who
carry promise for another season of thrills.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky, Duke and Kansas, the blue bloods of the sport, are on
hand for a made-for-ESPN event called the Great Eight, as is UConn,
still an outsider to the Final Four but for the moment ranked No. 1
in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   By the time another unpredictable season takes its twists and
turns and lands on the doorstep of March Madness, the cast of
characters assembled here will make up many of the All-Everything
teams.
</P>
<P>
   There was UConn's Richard Hamilton, cooler than the other side
of the pillow, dribbling twice, giving a head fake right, then
cutting left on a stutter-step drive down the lane that produced a
slick bucket on a finger roll.
</P>
<P>
   There was Hamilton's teammate, the barrel-chested Khalid
El-Amin, taking Washington's Donald Watts down along the baseline,
doing a 180-degree spin and sticking a defiant jumper in his eye.
</P>
<P>
   There was Wayne Turner, the point guard who steered No. 8
Kentucky's drive to the NCAA title last season, getting the
Wildcats back on the early prowl with drives and dishes and Heshimu
Evans controlling the inside in a 63-45 thumping of seventh-ranked
Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   There were Kenny Gregory and Eric Chenowith trying to step up
into the roles formerly filled by Paul Pierce and Raef LaFrentz as
the Jayhawks embark on another season that will likely be as
unchanging as the Kansas topography.
</P>
<P>
   We know that between now and the time the championship nets are
cut down next March in St. Petersburg, Fla., that so many of the
games will be entertaining. But the question is whether the quality
of those games _ and the health of the sport itself _ will be good.
</P>
<P>
   The game is changing fast. Maybe too fast. What used to be a
trickle of players leaving school early to pursue the big dreams
and big bucks of the NBA has turned into a torrent. Antawn Jamison
and Vince Carter, the pair of pillars who took North Carolina to
last year's Final Four, were among a group of eight early entrants
who crashed the top 10 picks in the NBA draft. One of them, Larry
Hughes of Saint Louis, leaped for the cash as a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   There is the ongoing controversy with summer leagues that
recruit _ and in some cases pay for _ players coming out of high
schools. There continue to be recruiting violations at colleges
across the country, and in the past couple of years, point-shaving
scandals have been uncovered at Northwestern and Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at a lot of the kids who have left North Carolina and
Kentucky,'' said Utah coach Rick Majerus, whose team lost to
Kentucky in last season's national-title game and will face Rhode
Island tonight. ``One of the questions that goes through my mind is
whether it makes more sense to try to recruit kids who are maybe a
notch below the elite level but will stay for four years and allow
you to build a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke's Mike Krzyzewski has won two NCAA titles in the '90s but
has watched the landscape change dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game is in good shape and bad shape at the same time,''
Krzyzewski said. ``It's in good shape on the court, because it is
still played with intensity and at a very high level. But the game
suffers off the court because a lot of it hasn't kept up with all
the changes that have taken place. You could say that the house
still looks very nice, but maybe we have termites.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the changes, the early exodus to the pros is the most
visible and is the one that most readily affects the caliber of
play.
</P>
<P>
   Washington stepped off a 4,300-mile flight from Hawaii, where it
played in a tournament, and was knocked for a hula loop in a 69-48
loss to UConn. But in a game that had 41 turnovers and a combined
shooting percentage of .408, not everything could be attributed to
beach legs. Of the 24 players who got into the game, only three
were seniors. And they totaled just 19 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   UConn's Hamilton is a junior, and El-Amin is a sophomore. But
there is no time for patience or building these days, because by
next year they both will likely be gone to the NBA. Which brings a
sense of urgency to the current No. 1 team.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe, even amid the color and excitement, a sense of
despair over where the game is headed.

NO. 1 UCONN BURIES WASHINGTON IN SECOND HALF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUD WITHERS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ So many of the principals were the same. So much about
the games was different.
</P>
<P>
   The rematch of the grinder in Greensboro was interesting only
for about 25 minutes Tuesday night in the tepid atmosphere of the
United Center. Then top-ranked Connecticut stifled Washington with
a 29-9 finishing run and handed the UW its first basketball loss of
the season, 69-48, in the Great Eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not every day you get the chance to play the No. 1
team,'' said UW guard Donald Watts. ``It's not every day you get
the chance to play in the United Center. It just didn't work out
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the sequel to Connecticut's pulsating, buzzer-beating
75-74 victory over Washington last March in the East Regional
semifinals. That one was won by Richard Hamilton's fallaway
13-footer; this was decided just after the first TV timeout in the
second half, when _ pick one _ (a) fatigue, (b) Washington's lack
of toughness, or (c) Connecticut's horde of athletes took over.
</P>
<P>
   The explanation of choice in the UW locker room was the middle
one; nobody from Washington, least of all coach Bob Bender, wanted
to lean on the most convenient excuse, which was the UW's three
weekend games in Hawaii and the 4,500-mile Sunday-night trip here
through Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it had much of an effect,'' UW center Todd
MacCulloch said in referring to fatigue. ``We won the (Big Island)
tournament, and everybody was feeling good. It was just a couple of
flights, that's all it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not an excuse for the way we played tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington was all right defensively, save for allowing 17
Connecticut offensive rebounds that helped UConn to a 48-28 edge on
the boards. UConn made more turnovers, 22-19. It was half-court
offense that was an adventure for the West Coast Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   MacCulloch led Washington with 13 points, hard-earned against
UConn's physical inside defense and quick weak-side help.
MacCulloch had six baskets and nobody else for the UW had more than
three, as neither Watts nor Deon Luton (a combined 6-for-19 from
the field) produced enough offensive support to keep Washington in
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively, we had nothing easy,'' Bender said. ``But I
credit Connecticut for that. They're deeper than they were a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very difficult to play against. They can attack the
defensive glass, and we were so worried about getting back, I don't
know if we had any offensive rebounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington had two horrendous stretches in the game. The UW
recovered from the first, but the second will stick with the
Huskies a while.
</P>
<P>
   In a first-half stretch of 9:43 between Washington baskets,
Connecticut built a 20-7 lead while the UW was going 0-for-11 with
six turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington crept back within 35-27 at halftime, exactly the
eight-point margin UW had to make up at the break in last spring's
NCAA tourney game. And when Washington nosed to within 40-39 on
MacCulloch's free throw with 15:59 left, it appeared a possibility
this one was also headed for the wire.
</P>
<P>
   That was an illusion. Washington blew two possessions to take
the lead, the start of a nightmarish eight turnovers in 12 trips
that quickly shoved UConn's lead to double digits.
</P>
<P>
   We'll never know whether it was fatigue, but suddenly Washington
couldn't repel UConn's acquisitive hands or keep Connecticut off
the glass. Bender also lamented quick UW offense in a game in which
the experimental 45-second shot clock could have worked to
Washington's favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's got to happen is, we've got to be tougher,'' Bender
said. ``I don't know if that's a simple thing to accomplish or a
difficult thing. But at least we can identify it.''
</P>
<P>
   Most shocking was that Connecticut's winning run coincided
perfectly with the departure of point guard Khalid El-Amin with
foul trouble. He exited with UConn ahead 40-39 when he drew his
fourth foul, and when he returned with 2:15 left, his team was up
by 22.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who feel El-Amin often hurts UConn by looking to
shoot too readily before passing, and that school of thought was
rewarded on this night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a guy of his ability go off the floor should be to our
advantage,'' Bender said. ``They turned it around and used it to
their advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington did a reasonable job on player-of-the-year candidate
Richard Hamilton, limiting him to 17 points on 7-of-21 shooting.
But Hamilton, unlike MacCulloch, had all sorts of help.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good player, but we guard players like that in the
Pac-10 everywhere,'' said Luton, who had primary responsibility on
Hamilton. ``I think I did pretty well. He did pretty well on me,
too, because I didn't make my shots, but I take the blame for that.
All my looks were wide-open.''
</P>
<P>
   Watts, recalling that season-ending game in Greensboro, felt a
distinct difference this time.
</P>

 8-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   CHICAGO _ For three weeks, they feasted on cupcakes: Quinnipiac,
a team playing its first game in Division 1, plus Richmond,
Hartford, and Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   But that was the ``preseason'' for the University of
Connecticut. Tuesday night, in what coach Jim Calhoun said was the
start of a four-game, week-and-a-half stretch that would more
clearly define his team, UConn began chewing on tougher fare, a Top
20 team that could test the Huskies, perhaps even beat them.
</P>
<P>
   But for the UConn faithful who made the journey here for Tuesday
night's Great Eight game at the United Center, the Huskies of
Washington proved to be nothing more than an annoyance for one
half.
</P>
<P>
   Using its speed, its defense, and its depth, UConn _ newly atop
the rankings in both men's and women's basketball _ made Washington
look like an ordinary opponent (instead of the 15th-ranked team
that it was) by rolling to a 69-48 victory.
</P>
<P>
   In the second game of the doubleheader, eighth-ranked Kentucky
(6-1) opened a big early lead over No. 7 Kansas (4-1) and never
looked back as it rolled to a 63-45 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead for UConn in the next 10 days are games with Michigan
State, Massachusetts, and Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played a game that made it difficult for us to do easy
things,'' said Washington coach Bob Bender, who brought his team
nearly 5,000 miles after winning the Big Island tournament in
Hawaii, only to see it lose for the first time in five games this
season.
</P>
<P>
   For a little more than a half, both sets of Huskies made it
difficult on themselves with sloppiness that belied their talent.
</P>
<P>
   In taking a 35-27 halftime lead, UConn committed 15 turnovers.
Calhoun chewed out his players _ mainly center Jake Voskhul _ as he
looked for solutions. Part of the problem, said Calhoun, were the
basketballs. Seems they were slippery, hard to hold, hard to shoot.
</P>
<P>
   Something clearly was wrong when Calhoun looked up five minutes
into the second half and saw that his team's double-digit lead had
shrunk to 1 _ 40-39.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to his concern were the four fouls on sophomore point
guard Khalid El-Amin.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the Huskies might have been in trouble, might have
started to question what they were doing. Not this team. Calhoun
not only can go nine deep in his rotation but also can go four deep
at point guard without losing a lot.
</P>
<P>
   This time it was forward Kevin Freeman who proved the catalyst,
along with All-America forward Richard Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   During a timeout after Washington closed to 40-39, Freeman (12
points) outlined the strategy he wanted his teammates to use.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hell with scoring,'' Freeman said in the huddle. ``Let's
not let them score.''
</P>
<P>
   And for the next seven minutes, that's just about what happened.
UConn, which is preparing for a Saturday meeting with No. 9
Michigan State in Storrs, Conn., simply overwhelmed Washington with
a 20-2 run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their quickness, their ability to put the ball on the floor
put us back on our heels,'' said Bender. ``They tightened the
screws on us. We didn't have an easy way to score.''
</P>
<P>
   While UConn continued to struggle offensively, the Huskies were
downright scary defensively _ double-teaming, flicking away at
loose balls, and crashing the boards with an effort that emphasized
how deep and talented they truly are.
</P>
<P>
   As for the pressure of being No. 1, the Huskies shrugged it off
the way they have all five opponents this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being No. 1 is a fun kind of pressure,'' said Hamilton, who
had a quiet evening of 17 points. ``You dream about being No. 1,
and if you don't want to, you don't belong in college basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun said it is too early to get excited about the ``We're
No. 1'' issue _ he says he still hasn't finished eating his
Thanksgiving turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's see where we are after we play Michigan State, UMass,
and Pittsburgh,'' he said. ``Then if we're No. 1, that will be a
good start to the season. But that's all it will be.''
</P>
<P>
   In the nightcap, Kentucky's Massachusetts combination _ Boston's
Wayne Turner and Worcester's Mike Bradley _ was instrumental in the
victory. Turner, a 6-foot-2-inch guard, scored a team-high 14
points, while Bradley, the 6-10 former Boston College recruit,
contributed 7 points and 6 rebounds.

kitchen, I played fast and loose with garlic and pepper, but
nothing could raise my shrimp-with-rice dish above the bland. The
next day's lunch was another couple's turn. After a lazy morning,
the wife sauntered into the kitchen saying she would make use of
leftovers. She swiftly transformed the remains from my meal,
flavoring the rice and shrimp with a little cumin from an ancient
bottle on the shelf. She, of course, got the applause that I had
suffered for. How did she do it, we asked. ``I just listen to what

KANSAS STATE'S MICHAEL BISHOP A WINNER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The one time Michael Bishop left a college football field as a
loser helps explain why and how he has won the other 46 times.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Kansas State lost at Nebraska, 56-26. It was
Bishop's fourth game with the Wildcats. After the game, he made it
clear that he felt his teammates had quit after the Huskers built a
41-6 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a situation I had never been in before, and I was just
trying to react the way I felt I needed to react,'' Bishop said.
``After that game, I felt it was time for me to step up. I started
speaking up in meetings, and people started listening to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might have sounded like I was being hard on the team, but I
was speaking the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   For Kansas State, Bishop is the truth. The senior quarterback
has been the Wildcats' playmaker in this 11-0 season that continues
with Saturday's Big 12 Conference championship game in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop's ``say what you feel'' attitude makes Kansas State coach
Bill Snyder uncomfortable. That's one of the reasons Snyder placed
Bishop off-limits to the media for much of this season. But Snyder
also knows that Bishop's comments after last season's Nebraska game
displayed Bishop's will to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael is an extremely competitive guy,'' Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I never lost,' and he said, `I never want to lose
again while I'm at K-State,''' Wildcats receiver Darnell McDonald
said of Bishop's comments a year ago. ``Everyone took that to
heart. We thought about it, and from then on, we've gotten better
and better.''
</P>
<P>
   In two seasons at Blinn College, Bishop led the Buccaneers to
consecutive 12-0 records and national junior college championships.
Last season, Kansas State was 11-1, including a Fiesta Bowl victory
over Syracuse in which Bishop had 390 yards total offense and
accounted for five touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   That's a 46-1 record as a starting quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised he's had this much success,'' said Central
Missouri State coach Willie Fritz, who coached Bishop at Blinn. ``I
didn't have any doubts that he could start \Rat Kansas State\S, but
to say he's going to wind up being in the running for the Heisman
Trophy and quarterbacking a team with a chance at the national
championship ... that's a stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop is from Willis. He was recruited out of high school by
Tennessee and Baylor. However, a change in NCAA eligibility rules
left Bishop half a credit short of core courses to be eligible as a
freshman. He enrolled at Blinn.
</P>
<P>
   After two national titles in junior college, Bishop was ready
for Division I-A. But several schools wanted him to change
positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the schools that recruited me wanted to move me to
defensive back or wide receiver,'' Bishop said. ``Coach Snyder
didn't want to play me anywhere but quarterback. I felt like \Rthe
other schools\S didn't think I could play quarterback at the
major-college level. All I needed was a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those schools was Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were reasons why we didn't recruit him, but it serves no
purpose to go into those publicly,'' Aggies coach R.C. Slocum said.
``But the statement that we tried to make a receiver out of him, I
would question the accuracy of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Slocum, though, has no doubt about Bishop's abilities as a
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's as dangerous as any quarterback I've seen play,'' Slocum
said. ``He's got the best combination of run and pass. He can run
like a running back, he can avoid the pass rush and he's got an
absolute rocket arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching film, and he threw a corner route way down
field, and he made it look like a 10-yard sideline throw. He is a
phenomenal player.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop's junior season was one of transition. Snyder considered
redshirting him last season to allow him to learn the team's
offense. However, Bishop showed too much athletic ability. Snyder
made him the quarterback and trimmed back the playbook to allow
Bishop to adjust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you I honestly knew how quickly he would mature
into our system,'' Snyder said. ``He's been in our program for just
14 months, I think he's made great progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop blossomed a year ago during 16 days of practice in
preparing for the Fiesta Bowl. He studied film for hours and
brainstormed with Snyder and offensive coordinator Ron Hudson. The
result was a dazzling performance and the foundation for this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Bishop completed 43 percent of his passes,
producing 13 touchdowns and eight interceptions. This season, he's
completing 53 percent and has 21 touchdowns against just three
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael has made a commitment to being a student of the
game,'' Hudson said. ``And he does things I can't coach.
Athletically, he's far and away the best I've worked with.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bishop gained his revenge against Nebraska. He led the
Wildcats to a 40-30 victory over the Cornhuskers on Nov. 14. Bishop
threw for two touchdowns and ran for two as he totaled 446 yards
total offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``In junior college I never had the opportunity to feel what it
was like to be on the losing end,'' Bishop said. ``Here, I had lost
to Nebraska once before. I had the opportunity to go back and play
against them and come out on top this time. That motivated me. I
wanted to go out and have another shot at them. It was a great
feeling to win that game.''

PALMEIRO RETURNS TO RANGERS FOR FIVE YEARS, $45 MILLION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Rangers re-signed their first baseman
yesterday, five years after the fact.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Palmeiro, who left the team as a free agent in November
1993, signed a five-year contract worth $45 million yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers owner Tom Hicks, president Tom Schieffer and general
manager Doug Melvin introduced Palmeiro as their first baseman last
night from The Ballpark in Arlington's fourth-floor offices.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro replaces Will Clark, the first baseman who replaced him
five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro, who hit .296 with a career-high 43 home runs and 121
runs batted in during 162 games this past season with Baltimore,
supplants Clark after an 11th-hour flurry he initiated.
</P>
<P>
   When contacted at home last night, Clark did not want to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro will receive $8 million annually and another $1 million
deferred per season. That represents a bargain compared to the
six-year, $80 million contract first baseman Mo Vaughn received
recently from the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought this would become a reality,'' Palmeiro said.
``It was always a dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin arrived at The Ballpark yesterday morning with ``no plans
or idea this would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Palmeiro _ urged by former Rangers left-hander Kenny
Rogers _ telephoned Melvin, despite the Orioles' offer of a
five-year contract worth $50 million Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro's emotions, though, tugged at him and made the
left-handed power hitter realize his desire to return to the
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where I want to be,'' Palmeiro said. ``This is where I
want to finish my career, and I want to win here. I think this is
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Schieffer and Melvin reached Hicks, who was returning from New
York on his private airplane. A five-minute conversation put the
wheels in motion, Schieffer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a unanimous recommendation that Rafael would be a very
positive influence on our team,'' Schieffer said.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro, who resides in Colleyville, might have given up some
money to return, but he added that ``it really didn't make a
difference _ whether it's $45 \Rmillion\S, $50 \Rmillion\S, $55
million _ when you're talking about that kind of money. You have to
weigh other things.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles' deal included twice as much deferred money, and
Palmeiro had investigated differences in Texas' and Maryland's tax
structures that decrease the apparent $5 million difference in
total value of the two offers.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin weighed the Rangers' most likely option _ re-signing
Clark to a one-year contract, perhaps with an option for the 2000
season _ should the organization bypass Palmeiro.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin planned to meet today with Jeff Moorad, who represents
Clark, to discuss his possible return.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was difficult to talk to Will,'' Melvin said. ``It's not
the way I wanted to do it. I had to call him and tell him that I
couldn't even meet with his agent.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin, though, judged Palmeiro a better fit for the Rangers for
these reasons:
</P>
<P>
   Power: Palmeiro, a left-handed power hitter, makes him ideal for
The Ballpark. Palmeiro hit .292 with 182 home runs and 553 RBI the
past five seasons. Clark hit .308, but his left-handed swing
produced only 77 home runs and 397 RBI the past five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard that The Ballpark was built for Rafael,'' Melvin
said. ``I think it is. You look at his stroke, his swing.''
</P>
<P>
   Durability: Palmeiro appeared in 736 games the past five
seasons. The oft-injured Clark, who turns 35 before Opening Day,
appeared in 609.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's important,'' Melvin said. ``That's stability. That's
having someone you know will be out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Hicks: ``Will probably had one more year left in him. He's
had injury issues in the past. Rafael will play for five years.
Will Clark will not, in our opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense: Palmeiro received his second consecutive Gold Glove
Award for defensive excellence this past season. Opponents often
took advantage of Clark's inferior arm strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense will improve dramatically,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro also made his first request of manager Johnny Oates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to hit third,'' Palmeiro said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anywhere you want,'' Oates responded, ``except fourth.'' Juan
Gonzalez, the American League most valuable player, bats cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers do not view Palmeiro as the missing link between
their organization and catching the World Series champion New York
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't be the final piece,'' Oates said. ``He's just one of
the pieces. We all have to do our job.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin's will continue today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very good nucleus for a club,'' Melvin said, ``but
we still need pitching.''

BAD IDEA GETS OLDER BY THE MINUTE

   BEVERLY HILLS _ The trouble with next month's fight between
George Foreman and Larry Holmes is not that they're a couple of
middle-age men. It's that they're the (begin ital)wrong(end ital)
middle-age men.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton vs. Kenneth Starr, you might fork over $39.95 to
watch on pay-per-view television. Jay Leno vs. David Letterman, you
might pay $500 for a ringside seat. Or, how about Gray Davis vs.
Dan Lungren in a rematch between the ropes?
</P>
<P>
   Foreman vs. Holmes, that's a harder sell, even in a day when
boxing fans have learned to expect the bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   But sell the fight, scheduled for Jan. 23 at the Houston
Astrodome, is what the two long-ago heavyweight champions tried to
do Tuesday afternoon at Planet Hollywood, mugging and posing
through the fourth of six stops on a nationwide promotional tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both men are going to have their ears intact,'' said Roger
Levitt, the bow-tied Englishman who is promoting the bout, as if to
say that not even Foreman-Holmes can compare with the 1997 Mike
Tyson-Evander Holyfield Bite of the Century for sheer buffoonery.
``Both men are going to be fighting for honor and pride, and to
celebrate George's birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, strange as it may seem, George's birthday is the
promotional hook for this fight, in which no championship and
little in the way of reputation will be at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Foreman, who began his boxing comeback in 1987 after a decade
out of the ring, will turn 50 on Jan. 10. Thus the fight in his
native Houston is billed as The Birthday Bash.
</P>
<P>
   It's not exactly The Rumble in the Jungle, the title of his 1974
fight, and rope-a-dope loss, to Muhammad Ali in Zaire, but at least
The Birthday Bash is a marketing first.
</P>
<P>
   As for Holmes, who has come out of retirement twice, he turned
49 on Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   At the mere suggestion that a pair of grandfathers whose ages
will total 99 won't do their spry best to put on a good show for
the TV and arena audiences, Foreman launched into a rollicking, if
sometimes nonsensical, speech on the powers of the paunch. Somehow,
he drew a connection between his derring-do on the canvas and the
career challenges facing downsized workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to tell my (middle-age) brothers, when they're
looking at your birth certificates and getting ready to fire you,
don't wait for them to fire you _ quit!'' roared Foreman, who has
been hit in the head a lot.
</P>
<P>
   It is _ and will be _ quite a show, all right.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether a pair of guys at this late stage of
their careers have the will to put on more than a 10-round show and
make it a credible fight.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt is paying Foreman $10million and Holmes $4million. The
checks will be in their pockets before they climb into the ring.
</P>
<P>
   And, the financial guarantees aside, neither man has anything to
prove or much of a boxing future to secure. Neither expects to
parlay a victory in Houston into a shot at a championship. Each, in
fact, hinted Tuesday that the fight could be his last.
</P>
<P>
   Which, in fact, makes this promotion, trumpeted as the summit of
geezer boxing, less appealing than each man's recent bouts against
much younger fighters. In those, at least, the greener opponents
were trying to make names for themselves by knocking off legends;
there was an edge, a hint of danger, to those weird spectacles.
</P>
<P>
   In !ital!this!off! weird spectacle, a skeptic might expect
Foreman and Holmes to enter the ring not so much as bitter rivals
than as dancing bears, throwing their hooks and uppercuts for
theatrical instead of concussive effect. And where boxing is
concerned, it pays to be a skeptic.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it just conceivable they'll go through the motions for the
entertainment of nostalgia buffs but when push comes to shove comes
to clinch, will they protect each other from serious harm?
</P>
<P>
   Foreman said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``You give me my integrity or don't give me anything,'' he told
a cynical reporter. ``No amount of money will take my integrity
away from me.'' In boxing, integrity means being willing to batter
and bloody even the most respected foe.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes agreed _ while acknowledging the complexity of the
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to hurt George Foreman. I don't want to kill him.
I hope he feels the same about me,'' Holmes said. ``But I'll do
whatever I have to do to win the fight.''
</P>
<P>
   If either man could work up a violent dislike for the other, it
might be Holmes, who was often less popular than his opponents even
during his 1978-85 reign as heavyweight champ and now finds himself
fighting another sentimental favorite in Foreman.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Foreman has ducked me,'' Holmes contended when asked
why the two have never fought.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Holmes admitted it's not hatred but the $4million
that's making him fight for the first time in 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line,'' he said, ``is to make some money and not
get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, that kind of talk won't pry $39.95 out of too many people.
</P>
<P>
   How much for Rupert Murdoch vs. Michael Eisner? &QL;

L.A. COUNTY JURORS ARRIVE TO AVOID BIG FINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A few minutes after Albert Kyle dodged a $1,500
fine by agreeing to do his time as a juror, he offered a swift _ if
fatalistic _ verdict on the Superior Court's new Sanction Summons
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm OK with it,'' Kyle said Tuesday morning, shrugging his
shoulders as he left the downtown courthouse. ``They gotta do what
they gotta do.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyle was one of 81 Los Angeles County residents ordered to court
Tuesday for the first wave of a program to sanction those who
ignore a call to jury duty. Sixteen showed up, and all provided a
good enough excuse to escape the fine.
</P>
<P>
   For the 65 who didn't show up, Assistant Presiding Judge Victor
Chavez imposed the full $1,500 fine. The fines were the first
punishments against accused scofflaw jurors in Los Angeles County
in more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not here to try and make money and we're not here to
frighten folks,'' Chavez said. ``We're here to let them know that
we need them.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent surveys have found jurors are an unhappy lot, in part
because most of them end up spending 10 days in a courthouse, often
without ever sitting in a trial.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Jury Services plans to start a pilot ``one-day,
one-trial'' system next year, which features more jurors serving
less time in court.
</P>
<P>
   But if that system ever has a chance of succeeding on a large
scale, the Superior Court will need a bigger chunk of the public to
respond to its jury summonses.
</P>
<P>
   While the Sanction Summons program will add only a handful of
residents to the jury pool, court officials said they hope people
will hear about the fines and think twice before throwing away
their jury questionnaires.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to serve in the military during a time that it was
required of my age group and that was very similar to this,''
Chavez said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 16 men and women who showed up Tuesday, all were sent
their first jury notice in July. Jury Services manager Gloria Gomez
said none are ``bad people.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyle, a 30-year-old technician who lives near downtown Los
Angeles, had moved to another address, and said he didn't get the
summons until a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just so happened that I went back to see some friends,''
Kyle said, recalling a visit to his old apartment. ``They told me,
`You've got some mail.' ''
</P>
<P>
   While Kyle said he expected a nightmare in court Tuesday, all he
had to do was fill out a two-page form. He straightened the matter
out and will return early next year to perform his civic duty.
</P>
<P>
   Some people who showed up Tuesday were excused from jury service
altogether, explaining in forms that they have medical problems,
don't understand English or _ in two cases _ can't serve because
they are convicted felons.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany Montgomery, a resident Fontana in neighboring San
Bernardino County, attended the hearing while her mother and four
children kept the motor running in a car outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had someone to keep care of my kids, I wouldn't mind
being a jury member,'' she said, after being excused from service.
``I don't know what I would have done if I had to pay that fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one potential juror came in with a situation complex enough
to require Chavez's attention _ a pharmacist who was excused by the
judge after explaining that no one else can run his business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously he needs to be there,'' Chavez said. ``I'm not going
to shut his business down.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez has a half-dozen more hearings scheduled this month, with
more to follow next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Sanction Summons program was last used in 1996, with
positive results.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez said the amount of jurors responding to their
questionnaires two years ago was about 50 percent before the threat
of fines, jumping to about 80 percent after the program was
implemented.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said fining jurors is rare in California, but Sonoma
and San Bernardino counties have had similar programs.
</P>
<P>
   Jury Services has a master file of 5.1 million Los Angeles
County residents _ compiled from Department of Motor Vehicle
records. This year, about 3.2 million jurors were sent
questionnaires, Gomez said.
</P>
<P>
   Fines for those who didn't show up to the hearing will be
collected just like any other civil judgment, Gomez said. If there
is still no response, a collection agency will handle the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez said anyone who is fined and can't pay is still welcome
to come to court and offer an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would certainly listen to them,'' he said. ``We're not here
to be heavy-handed in any way.''

STUDY RATES HOSPITALS FOR SERVICES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDITORS: Today in 1st graf refers to Wednesday.) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ San Fernando Valley area health centers rate well
at treating heart problems and orthopedic disorders, but shine a
little less brightly when fighting cancer, according to a private
survey of Los Angeles hospitals to be released today.
</P>
<P>
   The study by HCIA Inc., a Baltimore-based health care data firm,
analyzed government statistics on patient outcomes in cardiology,
oncology and orthopedics at 72 hospitals in the greater-Los Angeles
area. The results were used to rank the hospitals in the targeted
cases and overall.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the UCLA Medical Center and Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center each received top honors. The two facilities are
consistently ranked among the nation's top-five hospitals in the
public and private sectors, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Burbank's Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center was ranked No.
4 in total quality, while Glendale Memorial was No. 14, second best
in the Valley area. In cardiology, Saint Joseph was No. 5, top in
its local area, while Glendale Adventist took the No. 8 spot. The
two also were the local area's best in orthopedics _ at No. 8 and
No. 16. And in oncology, Saint Joseph was rated fourth-best in
greater Los Angeles, while Valley Presbyterian in Van Nuys came in
at No. 10.
</P>
<P>
   HCIA said the study should help consumers choose a hospital
tailored to their medical need, much the way would-be students
might pick a business school.
</P>
<P>
   ``This type of information is not generally available to the
public ... (but) it's important that consumers have this,'' said
Tod Featherling, president of the online health publication
Ahn.com, which co-sponsored the study.
</P>
<P>
   While Featherling and HCIA officials say the rankings are based
on objective, third-party data, primarily from the federal
government's Medicare program, others say any rating system is open
to bias in the way the numbers are interpreted.
</P>
<P>
   HCIA used data ``not designed for this purpose, so one could
question their validity,'' said Jim Lott, a spokesman for the
Healthcare Association of Southern California, the region's main
hospital trade group. Lott said, however, that HCIA is respected in
the industry for the numbers-crunching services the company
provides health-care organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Kara Welter, a spokeswoman for the Tarzana and Encino hospitals,
which scored below the mean in several categories, said the HCIA
report does not tell the full story. ``We all agree it's good
data,'' she said, ``but there's about five of these reports out
there, and this is only one.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen how HCIA's report or similar reports will
affect area hospitals. Most people choose a hospital because it is
covered by health plan or because their doctor has admitting
privileges at the hospital. HCIA's study might, however, be
extensively used by employers considering which health plans to
choose for their employees.
</P>
<P>
   Overall in the study, 11 San Fernando Valley-area hospitals were
ranked in the top half of greater-Los Angeles hospitals in
orthopedics, while five were in the bottom half. In oncology, nine
made it to the top half, while eight were below average. And for
total quality, 12 area hospitals were in the top half, while seven
were below the average.
</P>
<P>
   Complete results of the study are available on the Web site,
ahn.com.

RANGERS WILL DO JUST FINE, EVEN WITHOUT HIS UNITNESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ As fate would have it, there really was Life
After Randy Johnson for the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, some of us wondered about that. The notion of waiting
for His Unitness to make up his hairy mind had been ominous from
the start.
</P>
<P>
   Jilted by Johnson, the Rangers figured to turn to Plan B.
Whatever that was.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't Plan B,'' general manager Doug Melvin could say
with a smile on his moustache last night. ``Plan B can change
dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   You bet your Will Clark souvenir jersey it can.
</P>
<P>
   In signing Rafael Palmeiro yesterday, the Rangers not only made
themselves a better baseball team, but turned down the figurative
heat in the club's Ballpark offices.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the news from Arizona, the natives were restless.
In due time, maybe the owner himself would have become restless.
</P>
<P>
   It was Melvin's task this off-season to improve the lot of the
reigning American League West champions. Everything seemed to stem
from signing Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson, bedazzled by Jerry Colangelo, enlisted in Operation
Desert Mirage instead.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, Randy, can I buy a couple of those Diamondbacks World
Series tickets? (Giggle, giggle).
</P>
<P>
   If Diamondbacks owner Colangelo truly did convince Johnson that
his outfield of Bernard Gilkey, Dante Powell and Andy Fox is going
to turn the worst-hitting lineup in the National League (.246 last
year) into a pennant contender, maybe Melvin never did really have
a chance to get him.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe my original column for this morning _ the one where I
planned to wag an accusing finger at Melvin for letting down his
new owner _ would have been out of line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really set a mandate for Doug to pursue Randy,'' owner Tom
Hicks said last night. ``And I give him credit for doing as great a
job as he could possibly have done. It just wasn't meant to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Hold that thought. Hold it close, because I have never figured
Hicks as a ``wasn't meant to be'' kind of guy.
</P>
<P>
   He seems more of a ``just get it done'' guy. And until
yesterday, frankly, Melvin wasn't getting it done.
</P>
<P>
   Some of us were imagining what the Rangers' new marketing slogan
for next season would be _ ``Rangers '99: Please Hit It to the
Shortstop''? Or maybe ``The Thrill is Back ... and so is Todd
Zeile''?
</P>
<P>
   Surely, that would have silenced those higher-ticket-price
complainers.
</P>
<P>
   As Melvin said, ``You sit there and you wait and wait and wait
for the pitchers to make a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   He sat, he waited, he got rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   But in a stunning turn of developments, the sun did come up at
The Ballpark in Arlington yesterday morning. The fact that the
day's events started with a phone call from ex-Rangers pitcher
Kenny Rogers is too laden with Freudian implications and cosmic
intervention to allow possible explanation here.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny gave Rafael the piece of advice he should have delivered
five long years ago. ``He just said, `If you want to make it
possible in Texas, you can make it possible,''' Palmeiro related.
</P>
<P>
   Just say yes, in other words. And in a dizzying turn of events,
there suddenly appeared a familiar face at the podium last night,
saying, ``It's good to be home.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not the night to debate who misled whom in those
negotiations-turned-ugly five years ago. It was not the night to
weigh the pluses and minuses of a trade that, for all of its
undertones, did help produce the only two postseason teams in
Rangers franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, Palmeiro is an acknowledged star who should still
be producing at an All-Star level in the final year of his new
contract. In the five years since he left for Baltimore, he has
eclipsed Clark in nearly every offensive and defensive category _
especially in games played.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks himself was quick to note that this was not a move born of
post-Johnson anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying he wouldn't have done both Randy and Rafael, if
the opportunity presented itself,'' Hicks said.
</P>
<P>
   The new owner was confident that, yes, there would be Life After
Randy Johnson. Melvin would see to it.
</P>
<P>
   Call it Plan B. There really was one, after all.

   He sat, he waited, he got rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   But in a stunning turn of developments, the sun did come up at
The Ballpark in Arlington yesterday morning. The fact that the
day's events started with a phone call from ex-Rangers pitcher
Kenny Rogers is too laden with Freudian implications and cosmic
intervention to allow possible explanation here.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny gave Rafael the piece of advice he should have delivered
five long years ago. ``He just said, `If you want to make it
possible in Texas, you can make it possible,''' Palmeiro related.
</P>
<P>
   Just say yes, in other words. And in a dizzying turn of events,
there suddenly appeared a familiar face at the podium last night,
saying, ``It's good to be home.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not the night to debate who misled whom in those
negotiations-turned-ugly five years ago. It was not the night to
weigh the pluses and minuses of a trade that, for all of its
undertones, did help produce the only two postseason teams in
Rangers franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, Palmeiro is an acknowledged star who should still
be producing at an All-Star level in the final year of his new
contract. In the five years since he left for Baltimore, he has
eclipsed Clark in nearly every offensive and defensive category _
especially in games played.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks himself was quick to note that this was not a move born of
post-Johnson anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying he wouldn't have done both Randy and Rafael, if
the opportunity presented itself,'' Hicks said.
</P>
<P>
   The new owner was confident that, yes, there would be Life After
Randy Johnson. Melvin would see to it.
</P>
<P>
   Call it Plan B. There really was one, after all.

TCU STARTS QUICKLY, RUNS OVER UNT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH _ North Texas' plan coming into last night's game
against TCU was just to keep it close in the first minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We flunked the test,'' UNT coach Vic Trilli said.
</P>
<P>
   The Horned Frogs (6-2) had a 21-1 lead with 15:01 remaining on
the way to beating the Eagles (0-3), 122-69, at Daniel-Meyer
Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   The Horned Frogs reached 50 points with almost five minutes
remaining in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   They eclipsed 100 when guard Ryan Carroll nailed a 3-pointer
with 8:15 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time,'' Carroll said. ``We hadn't gotten 100 all
season. We should be averaging that.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the most points TCU had scored since getting 126 last
season against Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Games like this had come easy and often last season; the Horned
Frogs scored at least 100 points on 14 occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back to TCU basketball,'' coach Billy Tubbs said. ``It was our
kind of game.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU had six players finish in double figures, led by Marquise
Gainous with 26 points and 12 rebounds. Lee Nailon finished with 25
points, 11 rebounds and a career-high seven assists.
</P>
<P>
   Eagles forward Dexter Tennell said UNT's plan had been to double
Nailon and take chances with Gainous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nailon went out and just destroyed us,'' Tennell said. ``He
killed us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles tried to shut down the inside, and the Frogs
responded by shooting 55 percent on 3-pointers. UNT shot 25 percent
from behind the 3-point line.
</P>
<P>
   TCU also forced 32 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, outside, in transition, TCU dominated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of fun wasn't it?'' Nailon said. ``We finally
found someone to run with us.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, the Frogs had been playing teams trying to slow it
down and keep the tempo at a crawl.
</P>
<P>
   UNT tried to run with TCU, but simply lacked the fire power.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Mangrum led the Eagles with 17 points while Tennell and
Deginald Erskin both added 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ran on us, and we got down, and we didn't respond,''
Mangrum said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the biggest margin of defeat for UNT since a
Tubbs-coached Oklahoma team defeated UNT, 147-94, on Dec. 29 1989.
It was also the most points given up by UNT since a 124-107 loss to
Texas on Dec. 6, 1991.
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs said guard Derale Wilson had surgery on his left ankle
yesterday, and that surgery had gone well. He'll likely miss eight
weeks. ... UNT guard Chris Davis also missed last night's game.
He's having X-rays done today and likely will miss the next three
games. Davis, from Dallas Kimball, is averaging 8.0 points and 3.0
rebounds per game while playing an average of 21 minutes.

DODGERS TRADE FOR HUNDLEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It breaks down tidily to the Dodgers trading the
best hitting catcher in Mike Piazza for possibly the best
switch-batting power hitter in the game.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's what Tuesday's trade of offensively challenged
catcher Charles Johnson to the Mets for catcher Todd Hundley could
ultimately mean.
</P>
<P>
   If Hundley's surgically repaired right elbow is fully healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt all along we needed to balance our lineup,'' Dodgers
general manager Kevin Malone said. ``We needed a left-handed,
power-hitting, middle-of-the-lineup run-producer, and that's
exactly what Todd Hundley brings to the Dodgers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also picked up minor-league pitcher Arnold Gooch, a
22-year-old right-hander who spent last season at the Double-A
level, while the Mets got once-promising center fielder Roger
Cedeno. The Mets then traded Johnson, a Gold Glove catcher, to the
Baltimore Orioles for reliever Armando Benitez.
</P>
<P>
   However, Malone isn't done with offseason deals. Hundley joins
offseason acquisitions Devon White, Alan Mills and Mel Rojas, and
Malone said he wants to add depth to the bench and a quality
left-hander to the bullpen. Still, his primary target remains
free-agent pitcher Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be aggressive and active in the pursuit of Kevin
Brown,'' Malone said. ``We're going to do our best to add Kevin
Brown to this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, it should be noted, was traded to the Dodgers last
summer as part of the Piazza deal with the Florida Marlins. Hundley
becomes the third Dodgers catcher in six months, a turnaround that
mirrors the managing carousel during the same time frame. The
Dodgers had predominantly three catchers _ Johnny Roseboro, Steve
Yeager and Mike Scioscia _ during their first 33 years in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Malone said discussions involving Hundley began prior to the
World Series, and he tried to include the 29-year-old in an
expanded trade when the Dodgers acquired the right-handed Rojas
from the Mets for Bobby Bonilla last month.
</P>
<P>
   But the acquisition of Hundley is, at least partially, a risk
for the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The health of Hundley's elbow remains a question, especially how
it will respond to, and withstand, a season's worth of pounding and
throwing behind the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``My elbow is back to 100 percent,'' Hundley said. ``I think
taking most of the year off last year is helping me now. I have
been throwing, and it keeps getting stronger and stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley, who hit 71 homers and drove in 198 runs in 1996 and
'97, is still on the mend from his reconstructive surgery. It
forced him to miss most of the 1998 season, and when he did rejoin
the Mets he played almost exclusively in the outfield, hitting .161
with three homers and 12 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley caught a handful of games with the Mets last season and
threw out two of three baserunners. He said he had an MRI on Monday
that revealed no lingering damage. Malone said he and Dodgers team
doctors spoke with Mets team physician Dr. David Altchek about
Hundley's elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``They assured me that Todd was healthy, that this had healed
quicker than they anticipated and it healed stronger than Todd
anticipated,'' Malone said. ``Dr. Altchek had nothing but glowing
comments about Todd, his work habits, his flexibility. He says
that's a key to players rehabbing, their muscle structure and their
flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very comfortable with all the medical reports on Todd
and we think he's 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said he wasn't certain whether
Hundley would bat cleanup or fifth, but did say he wanted Hundley
to protect Gary Sheffield in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives our lineup a lot more flexibility, and I know how
good he is handling pitchers,'' Johnson said. ``I like Todd hitting
behind Sheffield. The main thing that Todd brings to the lineup is
he's explosive, but they're going to have to pitch to some guys in
front of him, and that's really important.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeway Series shakeup: Although it wasn't the biggest news of
the day, the Dodgers will play two exhibition games against the
World Series champion New York Yankees before the regular season
opens April 5 against Arizona. The Dodgers, who have played the
Angels in the Freeway Series since 1961, will play Anaheim on
Friday, April 3, then play two against the Yankees at Dodger
Stadium.

COLLAPSE IN 2ND HALF DEFLATES ASU, EVANS 
</HEADLINE>
 ORLEANS-ARIZSTATE-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arizona State Coach Rob Evans kept saying that the recent trip
to Hawaii was no vacation, but Tuesday night, it looked as if a
vacation is just what the Sun Devils need.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a rebuilding New Orleans squad playing its sixth straight
road game and fourth game in five days, ASU wilted in the second
half and lost to the Privateers, 53-47, at Wells Fargo Arena. The
point total was the Sun Devils' lowest since Jan. 30, 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ASU (2-4) led by 12 shortly after halftime but squandered that.
Then they went up by seven with 7:21 remaining and managed one
basket the rest of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Evans knew his first season at ASU would be a challenge, but he
was nearly crestfallen afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely the most disappointing loss I've ever been
associated with in 30 years as a coach,'' he said, ``from the
standpoint of the effort and the execution we didn't bring to the
floor.''
</P>
<P>
   After leading, 27-19, at the break, ASU made 7 of 26 shots in
the second half. New Orleans (2-4) shot 13 for 24 after going 8 for
27 in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really played well in practice,'' Evans said. ``And then to
see that not flow over to the court is what makes it
disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing but bad news for Evans. Freshman Chris Bryant,
a guard from Washington High School, has left the team for personal
reasons. And junior forward Okeme Oziwo, who came back from a
near-fatal car crash in August 1997, suffered a sprained ankle and
knee in practice and was out for this game and likely the next two.
</P>
<P>
   Oziwo's injury, combined with the result, heaped more misfortune
on ASU and junior guard Eddie House. He has withstood player
dismissals, a point-shaving scandal and the forced resignation of
Coach Bill Frieder to name but a few problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like bad luck like this always keeps happening to
Arizona State,'' said House, who came in scoring 21.4 points a game
but made 4 of 11 shots and had only nine points.
</P>
<P>
   ASU did, in fact, get a mini-vacation of sorts. The Sun Devils
have a mandatory day off, and House will get the wires removed from
the jaw he broke during practice Oct. 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only good thing I can see out of this,'' he said.
``Everything else is kind of bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans, who had said the team improved in its three games in
Hawaii, didn't see much good, either. The Sun Devils took bad
shots, he said, or missed too many layups, especially down the
stretch. And the defense, which Evans harps on more than anything,
was non-existent in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   It got so bad that Evans was forced to play a zone, and he
regards zones with the same fondness that kids do spinach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't played this much zone defense in my life,'' Evans
said. ``And we're having to play zone defense because we're not
guarding anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU shot 29.5 percent against New Orleans and had a season-high
19 turnovers. Freshman forward Chad Prewitt, from Greenway High
School, scored 12 points. He became the first starter other than
House and Bobby Lazor to reach double figures, and he drew praise
from Evans for his effort. So did freshman Kenny Crandall and
junior Jason Patton.
</P>
<P>
   Lazor had 12 points and 14 rebounds, but made 3 of 12 shots. He
did not elicit praise from Evans, who cited a leadership gap among
the players. Evans said his best leaders are Mike Batiste, who is
expected to be eligible Dec. 19, and Awvee Story, who transferred
from Illinois and is ineligible. The lack of floor leadership,
Evans said, ``is killing us right now.'' &QL;

TOP-RANKED CONNECTICUT UNIMPRESSIVE, BUT UNDEFEATED
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Life at the top of college basketball's heap is sweet
only if it comes at the end of sports' best weekend, the Final
Four.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're No. 1 any other time of the year, all you get is
added pressure, increased expectations and lots of inky clippings.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Connecticut men's basketball team ascended to
No. 1 this week for the second time in school history. And most of
the attention generated was because the school's women's team also
is atop the polls. (That's happened twice in Division I poll-dom;
UConn both times.)
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's wildly popular women's team has won its national
championship (1995). The men have yet to be emancipated.
</P>
<P>
   In its first outing atop the polls, the Huskies played like ...
an NIT first-round loser. Here at the Great Eight Basketball
Classic last night, UConn beat No. 16 Washington, 69-48, only
because the West Coast Huskies played worse than the East Coast
Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are always coming at us, and now, especially at No. 1,
everybody will be coming for us,'' Huskies husky point guard Khalid
El-Amin said. ``We showed how much character and talent this team
has. It really doesn't mean anything as a long as we keep playing
the best basketball we can.''
</P>
<P>
   That was hardly the case last night. The Huskies committed 22
turnovers. The highlights: They held Washington to 34.5 percent
shooting and blew the game open while El-Amin was on the bench with
foul trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Connecticut is a deep team,'' said Washington coach Bob
Bender, who was wearing a shirt that was awfully close to burnt
orange, the color of the school (Texas) where he nearly became the
coach last April. ``Having El-Amin on the bench should be an
advantage for us; they turned it into their advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   The traveling road show that college basketball stages each
November and December conspired to reduce this to a rec-league
game. Washington was playing after completing a 9,963-mile road
trip (Seattle-Hawaii-Chicago). Good for frequent fliers, but not
for basketball teams.
</P>
<P>
   Washington played as though jet-lagged; after taking an early
6-2 lead, the Huskies missed their next 12 shots and committed six
turnovers over their next 19 possessions. Even though their
opponent was inept, Connecticut didn't play much better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rushed things on offense and played like we were nervous,''
UConn coach Jim Calhoun said.
</P>
<P>
   There is a mania about Huskies Hoops. It's the No. 1 _ and only
sport _ in the state; nine papers regularly staff the team's games.
And while Calhoun has built a consistent top 10 program, this
season has created more excitement. In October, UConn fans began
inquiring about Final Four travel packages.
</P>
<P>
   The Final Four is somewhere Connecticut has never visited. The
Huskies have come close this decade, losing three regional finals
to Duke, UCLA and North Carolina, all members of the sports'
aristocracy.
</P>
<P>
   With five starters returning from last season's 32-5 team, UConn
was lumped with Duke and Stanford as this season's national
championship contenders. Based on NCAA Tournament history, one will
be lucky to reach the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   For the Huskies and Calhoun, their fast-talking, gum-chewing,
beat cop of a coach, a less than stellar performance in December
can be stored away for March viewing. The valuable lesson? Win when
you don't play your best and when you're manpower is reduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can learn from a game like this,'' Calhoun said.
</P>

OFFENSIVE-LINE WOES JUST A DISTANT MEMORY FOR COWBOYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ One season after causing a stir because of their
inept play, the Cowboys' offensive linemen have had some
controversial moments again.
</P>
<P>
   The issues pale in comparison to last year's problems _ lack of
depth and injuries, which were considered the root of the team's
6-10 record.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of having trouble finding someone who can play, the
Cowboys are having trouble finding room for a bevy of talented
blockers.
</P>
<P>
   Center Clay Shiver, the starter since last season, has recently
been supplanted by former Canadian Football League standout Mike
Kiselak.
</P>
<P>
   The right-guard spot was also of some issue before Everett
McIver went out with a season-ending knee injury against the
Seattle Seahawks. Many observers felt it should have been rookie
Flozell Adams' job _ citing Adams' immense potential and his
above-average performance in place of the injured McIver for five
games earlier in the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys claimed that McIver was the better player. It's all
moot now.
</P>
<P>
   And as a result, the Cowboys lead the league in fewest sacks
allowed (11). The line has paved the way for the league's
second-best running game and fourth-best offense.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, however, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones simply
smiled.
</P>
<P>
   Only if they could have had these problems last season, when the
Cowboys faced the agony of having much-maligned George Hegamin
protect quarterback Troy Aikman's blind side at left tackle in
place of injured Mark Tuinei, who was headed for retirement. Or
having to insert gimpy-kneed John Flannery at guard for an injured
Nate Newton. Or allowing Shiver to garner the center spot largely
unchallenged.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to becoming stronger, the line is also deeper, which
has allowed the Cowboys to overcome a plethora of injuries. Four of
the five starters have missed some time, yet the offensive line has
seen no drop-off.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the Cowboys made improving the line an off-season
priority. And he gives a lot of credit to scouting director Larry
Lacewell and his department for finding Kiselak, drafting Adams,
and signing top reserve Tony Hutson, who joined the team from the
practice squad last season and has seen time in place of tackle
Erik Williams.
More on the line
Though upset about his team's recent penchant for penalties,
Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said he will not reinstitute the
penalty-lap discipline he used during training camp. He said the
lap might be a detriment on game day.
</P>
<P>
   But the offensive linemen have been policing themselves for a
couple of years, levying fines on each other for, among other
infractions, penalties in practice, showing up late for meetings,
improper dress and eating in meetings.
</P>
<P>
   According to Shiver, the fines start at $10 at the beginning of
the week and double each day as they get closer to game day. Rookie
Flozell Adams has been hit the hardest so far with $750 in fines.
The money goes into a pot to pay for a party at the end of the
season.
Getting it straight
Williams takes a lot of heat from those in the press box for being
the Cowboys' biggest offender on pre-snap penalties. However,
closer inspection, thanks to Stats Inc., reveals that Williams has
some company in the false-start department.
</P>
<P>
   Left tackle Larry Allen and tight end David Lafleur are tied
with Williams for the team lead with four. Center Kiselak,
quarterback Jason Garrett and guard Flozell Adams have been
whistled twice each. Things that make you go hmmmm! So the Cowboys
signed Chris Warren in the off-season as an insurance policy for
running back Emmitt Smith, who was criticized for coming out of too
many games last season because of injuries. So far in 1998, Warren
has missed four games and could miss a fifth on Sunday with a groin
injury. Smith has missed none and is fourth in NFL rushing ranks
with 1,107 yards. ... Do you think injured cornerback Deion Sanders
will miss next week's matchup with the Kansas City Chiefs,
considering that he'll get a chance to go against former Falcons
buddy/foe Andre Rison? Remember the tremendous battle the two waged
in 1994, when Sanders was with the 49ers and Rison was still with
the Falcons? And they played football, too.
Billups a `Bad Boy'
Rookie cornerback Terry Billups is a bad boy for all the right
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The former communications and pre-law major at North Carolina is
part of ``Bad Boy Sports'' marketing company in New Jersey. It's an
offshoot of Sean ``Puffy'' Combs' Bad Boy Entertainment record
label.
</P>
<P>
   He also is part owner of a North Carolina-based production
company, which is working on two film documentaries.
YARD MARKERS: How far do the Cowboys have to go? First and Goal
</P>
<P>
   Was the cliche ``he has a nose for the end zone'' made with
Emmitt Smith in mind? Look at Thursday's game against the Vikings.
Smith wasn't particularly effective on the ground, rushing for just
44 yards on 18 carries. However, when the Cowboys neared the end
zone, he was unstoppable, rushing for three touchdowns to tie
Marcus Allen atop the league's all-time list for rushing
touchdowns.
First and 10
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Troy Aikman has thrown just one interception in his
last 184 attempts and set a team record against the Vikings for
attempts without an interception (57).
Moving back up
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys receiver Michael Irvin is quietly moving back up the
league receiving charts after 18 catches for 235 yards in the past
two games. Irvin is third in the NFC with 62 receptions and fifth
in yardage with 868.

COWBOYS UNDER RUSH ORDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Left tackle Willie Roaf is regarded by Cowboys
coaches as the New Orleans Saints' best offensive lineman.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Roaf will represent the stiffest challenge for
Cowboys defensive ends Kavika Pittman and Greg Ellis, who know that
pressure on Saints quarterback Kerry Collins will take the pressure
off the depleted Cowboys secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greg and Kavika have got to mix up how they try to rush the
passer,'' defensive line coach Jim Bates said. ``They'll have to
know when to use speed, when to use power. And we'll have to win
some games on some stunts. If you keep coming at \RRoaf\S with the
same technique, he'll stop you because he's a good enough athlete.
We've got to try to keep him off balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Roaf may be the power gear in the Saints' offensive line, but he
has certainly had his problems this season. Roaf has been called
for holding four times (the league leaders have seven), and has
been flagged for three false-start penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Both totals lead the Saints. Roaf and company have allowed 46
sacks, fourth-most in the league, including 15 in the last four
games. After the Saints allowed six sacks in a 30-10 loss Sunday to
the Miami Dolphins, the team was chewed on by coach Mike Ditka, who
called his team a bunch of ``cowards.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was as bad as we've played,'' Roaf told the New Orleans
media. ``He \RDitka\S told us there were a lot of cowards on this
team, and we've got to play better or a lot of changes are going to
be made. I would like to think that people will come out with a
sense of urgency.''
</P>
<P>
   That means the Cowboys will have to raise their game, as well.
Pittman, who started the season with five sacks in the first seven
games, has just one sack in the last five. Ellis has 2.5 sacks,
none in the last three games.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the Cowboys are ranked 19th in the NFL with 31 sacks.
They have just six sacks in the last three games, including none
from nose tackle Chad Hennings, and one from defensive tackle Leon
Lett.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of pressure has allowed opposing quarterbacks to stand
tall in the pocket (or run around, as Arizona's Jake Plummer did)
to throw for 984 yards and nine touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you create a big pass rush it helps your coverage,''
Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said. ``I think \RCowboys pressure\S has
come in spurts for us. We've not done as consistently as we like,
but at the same time, there have been times when we've got around
the \Rquarterback\S quite a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last month of the season, the Cowboys need to do more
than quite a bit.

COWBOYS' UNDRAFTED FREE AGENT BILLUPS COMES IN HANDY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Almost lost amid the criticism of the Cowboys'
secondary in the 46-36 Thanksgiving Day loss to the Minnesota
Vikings was the play of rookie cornerback Terry Billups.
</P>
<P>
   Who?
</P>
<P>
   That's the reaction Cowboys fans had when Billups, whom the
Cowboys moved from the practice squad to the active roster last
week, replaced an injured Kevin Smith at left cornerback for much
of the Vikings game.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Billups earned a spot on Randy Moss' personal highlight
film, along with other toasted members of the Cowboys secondary.
</P>
<P>
   But in the words of Cowboys coach Chan Gailey _ who said the
Cowboys signed Billups for depth purposes, but didn't expect him to
play that much in the game _ he ``acquitted himself well.''
</P>
<P>
   Billups has acquitted himself well despite not starting his
final two seasons at North Carolina. However, Billups, who roomed
with Cowboys top pick Greg Ellis in college, refused to give up the
dream of playing pro football.
</P>
<P>
   After not being selected in the 1998 NFL draft, he signed as a
free agent with the New England Patriots, but was released before
the season.
</P>
<P>
   He then joined the Miami Dolphins' practice squad for two weeks
before they released him, enabling the Cowboys to pick him up on
Oct. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Seven weeks and a horde of defensive back injuries later,
Billups became a member of the active roster on Nov. 24 and made
his professional debut before a nationally televised audience
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't beat that feeling for nothing in the world _
Thanksgiving Day, my first NFL game and I'm playing for the Dallas
Cowboys,'' Billups said. ``I don't think there is a kid in America
who hasn't been a Cowboy fan from when they were little. I couldn't
have asked for a better script. The only thing better would have
been if we could have won the game.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears he'll get a chance to alter the script against the
New Orleans Saints on Sunday, as injuries to starting cornerbacks
Deion Sanders and Kevin Smith will likely put Billups on the field
again. If he doesn't start, he will play in the Cowboys' nickel
defense and is slated to be the team's primary punt returner.
</P>
<P>
   Billups is ready for it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long road,'' Billup said. ``Nobody expected me to
be here. It was a matter of believing in yourself and having a
great family behind me and belief in the Lord that I would get an
opportunity. I'm just going to play my best.''

HOUSE PANEL BICKERS OVER PERJURY ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   By LOUIS FREEDBERG  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In another prolonged display of partisan
infighting, the House Judiciary Committee grappled Tuesday with
whether perjury constitutes an impeachable offense and voted to
expand its inquiry into possible campaign finance violations by
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-hour hearing moved at an often tedious pace, reflecting
none of the urgency that could be expected from an impeachment
inquiry that Republicans say they want to wrap up by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, positions on both sides seemed to harden, and rhetoric
intensified. ``Here we are moving closer and closer to
impeachment,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. ``Why? Because
there is is one small segment on the far right who have lost all
objectivity and are determined to impeach the president at all
costs. Their hatred of the president exceeds their caring about
this country and its people.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer appealed to Rep. Bob Livingston, who will replace House
Speaker Newt Gingrich in January, to ``put an end to the hearings.
. . . Mr. Livingston, this test may be the most important you'll
ever face as speaker. Lead us out of the abyss.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the committee chairman, rejected
suggestions that Clinton should be held to a lower standard than
ordinary Americans who perjured themselves. ``It is particularly
disturbing, and indeed shameful, that many who generally claim to
represent the weak now argue that the powerful should be allowed a
pass when they break the rules,'' he said. ``There is nothing just
or fair in a double standard.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House, too, weighed in with some of its strongest
criticisms of the committee to date. ``What it really is is a
partisan process designed to damage the president and go after and
investigate the president on any subject that they see fit,'' said
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart. ``My guess is that the
committee has been hijacked by the extremists.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee officially expanded its investigation beyond
independent counsel Kenneth Starr's charges that there is
``substantial and credible evidence'' that Clinton had committed
impeachable offenses in attempting to keep secret his affair with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The panel voted along party lines, 20 to 15, to issue subpoenas
to obtain memos prepared by Charles LaBella, the former head of the
Justice Department's campaign finance task force, and by FBI
Director Louis Freeh. It also voted to subpoena materials that
Starr has gathered on former Democratic fund-raiser John Huang.
</P>
<P>
   In this partisan atmosphere, even moderate Democrats are shying
away from considering voting for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Rep. Ellen Tauscher, a moderate Democrat from
Northern California, was one of only 31 Democrats to vote for the
Republican resolution authorizing the current impeachment inquiry.
But Tuesday, Tauscher blasted the hearings as partisan and said she
will not vote to impeach Clinton, regardless of the panel's
eventual recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not heard a single new factoid,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tauscher said Clinton's behavior was ``indefensible and
inappropriate,'' but she expressed disappointment that the
committee has not defined what constitutes an impeachable offense.
``That's what I expected them to do; that's why I voted for the
hearings in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee heard from 11 witnesses, including Elliot
Richardson, the attorney general for Richard Nixon who resigned
rather than fire Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor
investigating Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no comparison between the aggregate of the things for
which this committee voted articles of impeachment in 1974 and the
conduct of a president in a sexual relationship with a White House
intern,'' said Richardson, now 78.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on the committee called two witnesses who had been
convicted of lying about sex in a civil lawsuit in an attempt to
rebut Democratic arguments that Clinton's offenses were so minor
that no prosecutor would ever move to convict him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because a president is not a king, he or she must abide by the
same laws as the rest of us,'' Barbara Battalino told the
committee. Battalino is a former Veterans Affairs hospital
psychologist who is serving a six-month home detention sentence
after pleading guilty in a case in which she lied about a sexual
relationship with a patient.
</P>
<P>
   Another witness was Pam Parsons of Atlanta, a former University
of South Carolina women's basketball coach who pleaded guilty to a
federal perjury charge in the mid-1980s for giving false testimony
in a civil case about a sexual relationship she had with one of her
players.
</P>
<P>
   At times some of the exchanges seemed to be more appropriate for
late-night comedy routines than the weighty matter of impeaching a
president for possibly the second time in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., one of the president's strongest
critics on the panel, asked Parsons, ``Am I correct that the
subject of your perjury was consensual sex?''
</P>
<P>
   When Parsons answered ``no,'' McCollum seemed taken aback, and
said, ``No? What was the subject of the perjury, then? Please
clarify that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's really kind of funny,'' said Parsons. ``There is a
gay bar, called Puss 'N Boots, in Salt Lake City, Utah. It wasn't
easy to say I'd been there.''
</P>
<P>
   Another witness, retired federal Judge Leon Higginbotham,
testified he could not see the relevance of the women's testimony.
``The president is the most indispensable person in America,'' he
said. ``I don't see how you can equate the president of the United
States with a basketball coach from the University of South
Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde ended the contentious session just before 7 p.m., telling
his colleagues that the panel will not meet again until next week,
when it may well vote on articles on impeachment. But he gave no
hint how the panel will deal with any new material it gathers on
Clinton's fund-raising practices. ``I think next week will be a big
week in our lives,'' Hyde said, as he gaveled the session to a
close.

HOPES FOR FEWER SIDE EFFECTS WITH NEW KINDS OF PAIN DRUGS  
</HEADLINE>
   By CARL T. HALL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pain sufferers may be getting some new drug options that appear
to bring relief with fewer side effects than most other treatments.
</P>
<P>
   One drug, called gabapentin, is already on the market as a
treatment for epileptic seizures. Two new studies, appearing
Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, show
the drug is an effective painkiller in hard-to-treat cases of nerve
damage from diabetes or shingles.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, a panel of experts advising the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration endorsed the first in a potential new line of pain
relievers, known as Cox 2 inhibitor drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The new medications are designed to reduce inflammatory pain
from arthritis, without the stomach distress and other
gastrointestinal side effects of widely used painkillers.
</P>
<P>
   The Cox 2 inhibitors are being widely touted as potential
blockbusters, likely to generate at least $1 billion a year in
sales during their first year on the market. Estimates for
worldwide sales of all analgesics run as high as $12 billion a
year.
</P>
<P>
   But many experts doubt the new drugs will live up to their early
billing as ``superaspirins.'' The evidence does suggest they cause
fewer side effects than ibuprofen and aspirin, even with daily use
for many years. But the Cox 2 inhibitors don't seem to control pain
much better than current treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA-sponsored advisory panel voted to recommend approval of
Celebrex, G.D. Searle &AMP; Co.'s Cox 2 inhibitor, for both
osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. The vote paves the way for
full FDA approval sometime next year. Meanwhile, Merck &AMP; Co. has
its own Cox 2 inhibitor awaiting approval, and other drugmakers are
said to be close behind.
</P>
<P>
   Patients with pain from nerve damage will not need to wait to
try gabapentin _ it's now sold as an anti-convulsant under the
brand name Neurontin by Parke-Davis, a unit of Warner-Lambert Co.
</P>
<P>
   Because the drug is already on the market, doctors are free to
start prescribing it immediately for pain patients. Many already
have been using it as a pain remedy, in fact, although they have
had little besides rumor and first-hand experience to suggest that
it works.
</P>
<P>
   The new studies were carried out by independent teams of
clinical researchers across the country, including doctors at the
University of California at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Results showed that the drug works at least as well and probably
better than other treatments for neuropathic pain, but with far
fewer side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Although the tests were conducted only in diabetes and
post-herpetic neuralgia, or shingles, experts said it might also
help alleviate nerve pain suffered by people with cancer and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very important advance in pain management,'' said Dr.
Edgar Ross, director of the pain management center at Brigham and
Women's Medical Center in Boston, who participated in one of the
two studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time we have a drug reasonably
well-tolerated by most people and effective for a problem that has
been resistant to most treatments.''
</P>
<P>
   A Warner-Lambert spokeswoman said the company is evaluating the
new evidence, and may seek FDA permission to start promoting
Neurontin as a pain remedy. But no decision has been made, she
said.

 &HT;    Records suggest remains of Earhart found in 1940
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Newly discovered records of bones found in 1940 on a
remote island in the South Pacific indicate that the remains might
have been those of aviator Amelia Earhart, according to a report to
be presented Friday at the annual meeting of the American
Anthropological Association in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Two forensic scientists who have studied those records say they
appear to describe bones that would belong to a white woman of
about the same height and weight as Earhart, who disappeared July
2, 1937, while on an attempt to fly around the world. If the
scientists can find the bones, possibly stored at the Fiji Medical
School, they hope to conduct a DNA analysis to see if their theory
is correct.
</P>
<P>
   Since radio contact was lost with Earhart's plane, theories have
abounded about what happened to her and the navigator. The
consensus is that they crashed into the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery, led by
Richard E. Gillespie, has been trying for years to solve the
mystery. In the past decade, the group has focused on the island of
Nikumaroro, which at the time of Earhart's disappearance was an
uninhabited British colony called Gardner Island. In 1991,
Gillespie found shoe fragments on the island that he said were
similar in size and appearance to those worn by Earhart on the
flight.
</P>
<P>
   But the Amelia Earhart Birthplace Museum, headquartered in
Atchison, Kan., maintained there is no evidence Earhart's plane
landed or crashed near or on Gardner Island, and it expressed
skepticism at any evidence suggesting otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very unlikely it went down near Gardner,'' said Louise
Foudray, the museum's director. ``We don't think it went that
far.''
</P>
<P>
   The bones were discovered in September 1940 on Nikumaroro. In
1997, a TIGHAR investigator stumbled across the long-forgotten
report of the findings. The report by British officials, found on
nearby Tarawa Atoll, suggested they ``possibly (are) those of
Amelia Earhart.''
</P>
<P>
   The records consisted of radio communications and apparently
were kept secret after the remains were found because World War II
had started and the Japanese were threatening the South Pacific,
Gillespie said.
</P>
<P>
   The British Foreign Office in England had additional records on
the discovery, descriptions by a primary care physician on the
island of Fiji who examined the bones. Dr. D. W. Hoodless'
observations were sent to Gillespie, then to two forensics experts,
Drs. Karen Burns of the University of North Carolina and Richard
Jantz of the University of Tennessee. Both concluded the
descriptions suggest the remains were those of a white woman,
between 5-foot-5 and 5-foot-9.
</P>
<P>
   Burns said Hoodless' handwritten notes contain observations and
measurements of bones. Both Burns and Jantz concluded that Hoodless
made mistakes both in naming skeletal parts and in measuring them.
His measurements, which he used to conclude the skeleton was that
of a male, could not have been that of a man, the scientists
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Burns and Jantz used a sophisticated computer model now widely
used by forensic anthropologists and police to identify skeletal
remains. ``My results are different from those of Dr. Hoodless
because the methods for analyzing human skeletal material are far
superior today than they were in 1940,'' Burns said. Jantz said:
``There's a very strong circumstantial case these are the remains
of Amelia Earhart. At the least, you would say these remains are
consistent with what we would expect Amelia Earhart's remains to be
like.''
</P>
<P>
   TIGHAR, a nonprofit organization, plans to go to Fiji either
next spring or in 2000 to hunt for a box containing the bones
described by the British. If the remains are found, Burns hopes to
draw DNA samples that can be compared to relatives of Earhart's.
</P>
<P>
   Burns is involved in another high-profile identification case.
She is part of a team trying to use DNA to determine whether bones
found in the Pulaski monument in Savannah are indeed those of Gen.
Casimir Pulaski, a Revolutionary War hero killed in the Battle of
Savannah.

 &HT;    Georgia lottery winner a felon
 &HT;    By Rhonda Cook
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The winner of the state's biggest Lotto jackpot _ a
prize estimated at $31 million if paid out over time _ is on parole
and has a lengthy criminal history in Georgia and at least three
other states, according to criminal justice records.
</P>
<P>
   Two-and-a-half months after his numbers were drawn, Kenny Dukes
appeared Monday at a news conference and picked up a check for
$10.65 million _ his winnings after taxes were taken and about half
of what he would have received had he taken it in 30 annual
installments.
</P>
<P>
   He was vague about his past, describing himself as a ``simple''
man who recently retired from his job as a superintendent at a
Savannah pre-cast concrete company. Now that he is rich, he said,
he wants to build Habitat for Humanity houses and start a
construction business.
</P>
<P>
   Dukes stood with his family and told reporters that he had a
``good relationship with the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no law preventing lottery jackpots going to felons.
</P>
<P>
   According to state records, Dukes, who also had called himself
David Lee McKenzie over the years, has been in Georgia prisons
three times and in a South Carolina prison once since the late
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   He is on parole until July 2001 for burglarizing his mother's
trailer.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least we know there will never be an excuse for him not
paying his parole supervision fee,'' said Chuck Topetzes, director
of parole for Georgia. The $10 monthly fee goes into a fund from
which victims can claim restitution.
</P>
<P>
   Topetzes said while Dukes had a ``checkered past,'' he has done
well on parole.
</P>
<P>
   Dukes' telephone number is not listed and he could not be
reached for comment Tuesday. But his attorney said Dukes had hoped
that his past would not become public. ``You can't do much about
it,'' said Brunswick attorney Jim Bishop.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop said Dukes told him of his past, and that he had tried to
make things right with his family and `` 'right with my God.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Dukes' mother said her son's past is irrelevant. ``He's paid his
debt to society, and he's risen from a carpenter to a plant
superintendent in two years,'' Marlene Dukes said.
</P>
<P>
   Dukes was released from a Savannah halfway house May 29, 1997,
after serving more than two years for burglarizing his mother's
Glynn County mobile home and taking $1,400 in jewelry before
grabbing $80 in coins she kept under the front seat of her truck.
</P>
<P>
   State records show that two weeks before he was to leave the
Savannah Transitional Center, Dukes was put on restriction because
he came back to the halfway house from an approved outing with a
lottery ticket, which was against the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Marlene Dukes said she and her son had long ago settled their
differences. ``I don't think that's anybody's concern but mine.
That's in the past. It's over and done with,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dukes is also on parole for burglarizing the home of a man who
had just fired Dukes' then-wife _ the same night he robbed his
mother's home.
</P>
<P>
   Records show he has been charged in Florida, South Carolina and
Nevada with a range of felonies, including aggravated assault,
theft, robbery, drunken driving, fraud, domestic violence, simple
battery, trespassing and obstruction of a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   Vicki Gavalas, spokeswoman for the Georgia Lottery, said
officials did not know of Dukes' past. ``Anybody over the age of 18
can purchase a lottery ticket. And we certainly have no way of
knowing any player's background,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as we're concerned, the purchase of the ticket, the
validation of the ticket, was all legal,'' Gavalas said. ``There's
no reason for us to check the background of any player.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Sept. 19, folks in the little town of Darien, Ga. have
wondered who bought a winning QuikPik ticket at the nearby Mobile
Express station in McIntosh County. Dukes, who was living in
Savannah when he bought the ticket, told only his lawyer and his
parents that he was a sudden multimillionaire because, he said, he
needed the time to make sure he had ``all the i's dotted and all
the t's crossed,'' Bishop said at the Monday news conference.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, while still anonymous, he shopped at a coastal
Georgia Walmart, then drove to Atlanta for a car-and-truck shopping
spree with his brother and three sisters.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-year-old Dukes explained to reporters Monday that he was
``quite comfortable with my lifestyle before and I wasn't in a
hurry to become rich.'' He said he needed time to get used to the
idea.
</P>
<P>
   According state Board of Pardons and Paroles records, Dukes
faced charges in 1976 in Georgia for burglary and in Florida for
trespassing. He was again charged with trespassing in Florida in
January 1977 and had a drunken driving charge in Georgia in July
before being sent to prison that year for the burglary. He was
sentenced to a year in prison and three years probation; he was
paroled after two months.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina sentenced Dukes to four years in prison in late
1979 for theft by taking, robbery and disorderly conduct. He served
less than four months.
</P>
<P>
   His next trouble in Georgia, according to records, was in 1985
when he was charged with obstructing a police officer, aggravated
assault and theft. He pleaded guilty to the aggravated assault
charge, stemming from an incident at a night club. He walked in
without paying the $3 cover charge and got into a tussle with
bouncers. As he fled in his car, he drove in circles in the yards
of at least two homes and rammed two police cars.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Dukes admitted to police, he broke into several vending
machines at a Brunswick Holiday Inn. Police found him at the hotel
registration desk, drinking a beer, and they found $84 in coins on
the front seat of his Cutlass.
</P>
<P>
   He faced a judge one time for both the 1985 and 1987 charges and
was sentenced to his second term in the Georgia prison system, a
total of five years. He served about 2 1/2 years and was paroled
Jan. 1, 1989.
</P>
<P>
   But before he went to court in 1987, Dukes faced several charges
in Florida, including robbery, theft, and burglary. Nevada charged
Dukes with fraud in 1991, and in 1994 Dukes again was charged in
Florida with simple battery and domestic violence. There were no
details in his Georgia file on the outcome of the Nevada and
Florida charges.

 &HT;    Pigs' music determined a legal noise
 &HT;    By Pat Moore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STUART, Fla. _ The music two pig farmers say they play for their
swine's health and enjoyment fell within allowable levels of Martin
County's new noise ordinance last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just thankful the truth is in black and white,'' pig
farmer Paul Thompson said of the sheriff's report, released
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson and his neighbors, Thomas and Faith Anne Rossano, were
sued this year by The Florida Club, which claims the country and
contemporary music blaring from speakers aimed toward its golf
course is so loud it disturbs the community's way of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about music. It's about pigs, and it's about
smell,'' said Thompson, who has raised pigs at his home for more
than three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the golf community said the sheriff's noise tests
will not affect the lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not suing for any violation of the county code at all.
We're suing under the law of nuisance,'' attorney Louis Lozeau
said. ``The law says you cannot unreasonably annoy or harass your
neighbor, and playing music so loud it can be heard a half-mile
away is an unreasonable annoyance.''
</P>
<P>
   Lozeau and attorney Tom Warner, a Republican state
representative, persuaded Circuit Judge Larry Schack last month to
order Rossano to lower the music he plays to his pigs until the
case is decided at trial in January.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Rose Marie Richard said Schack didn't consider the
county's noise ordinance when ruling against the Rossanos because
Martin deputies did not yet have equipment to measure sound levels.
</P>
<P>
   A sheriff's officer from St. Lucie County, which has used noise
meters for several years, took the readings for Martin deputies
Nov. 9 after golf community residents complained of loud music from
both pig farms.
</P>
<P>
   Richard said she may ask Schack to rescind his order based on
the sheriff's findings.
</P>
<P>
   But Lozeau and Warner filed court documents Tuesday asking the
judge to enter a similar order requiring Thompson to lower the
music at his farm. A hearing date has not been set.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said Florida's Right to Farm Act protects him from
nuisance suits, because he farmed on his property nearly 30 years
before The Florida Club was developed.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can I be a nuisance if I'm not violating the law?''
Thompson asked. ``I think I should be entitled to the freedom that
the law allows everybody else.''

   AUSTIN, Texas _ State regulators have approved a new surcharge
that will begin appearing on all telephone bills next month, but
officials said it will replace several charges that customers
already pay and should not result in a higher total bill.
</P>
<P>
   All telephone companies _ local, long-distance and wireless,
including pagers _ must pay the new fee, about eight tenths of 1
percent of each monthly bill. They are not required to pass on the
new surcharge to customers but are expected to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The Public Utility Commission, voting 2-0, acted Tuesday under
mandates from federal and state laws to spell out and spread out
subsidies built into the telephone system as it moves from monopoly
to competition so that all customers pay them, not just local
service customers.
</P>
<P>
   The new surcharge, expected to bring in about $87 million a year
for the Universal Service Fund, will appear as a separate item on
monthly bills and replace charges that have been collected for
years to subsidize telephone service for low-income customers,
those with speech or hearing problems and the rural customers of
small local phone companies. The fund provides the money for the
subsidized services.
</P>
<P>
   However, despite two years of work, the new surcharge will not
incorporate a much larger, additional subsidy that keeps rates low
for local service in rural areas served by larger local phone
companies, particularly Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. and GTE
Southwest Inc. On that issue, the commission will ask for guidance
from the Legislature, which will convene Jan. 12 for a five-month
session.
</P>
<P>
   The commission had hoped to collect an additional 4 percent or
so on monthly bills for the fund to subsidize telephone service in
rural areas, where costs are higher because there are fewer
customers distributed over a larger area than in cities and
suburbs. The additional surcharge would have brought in an
estimated $359 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   To offset the 4 percent increase, the commission had planned to
slice the access charge on long-distance calls _ about 12 cents a
minute _ by about 3 cents. Long-distance providers pay local phone
companies access charges to complete their calls.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the commissioners wanted the savings passed on to all
local customers, not just those who make frequent long-distance
phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   But the commission has no authority to require the long-distance
companies to pass on to their customers any reduction in access
charges.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, MCI WorldCom and Sprint, the three long-distance companies
with more than 90 percent of the Texas market, said they would pass
on the savings to customers. But MCI declined to detail how it
would spread out the savings among customers, saying the
competitive market would best determine that.
</P>
<P>
   So PUC Chairman Pat Wood and Commissioner Judy Walsh, rather
than add a significant surcharge to all telephone bills with no
assurance of reductions elsewhere, said they would ask the
Legislature to resolve the issue either by giving them sufficient
authority to ensure the savings are passed on to customers or by
making it clear that lawmakers are willing to take their chances
with the market.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said she saw ``customers caught in a vise here and no one
seems to care about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Kitty Fox-Hessler, vice president of regulatory
affairs for AT&AMP;T in the Southwest, said the company was committed
to passing onto customers any cuts in access charges but that it
``disagrees that such a heavy regulatory hand is needed in this
very competitive market.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Maddox, a spokesman for Southwestern Bell, said the company
had no immediate reaction.

 &HT;    If it takes a PAC to make 'em laugh . . .
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ I'm starting a political action group to get rid
of humorless people who can't take a joke.
</P>
<P>
   The name of the organization is Good Riddance to Unrelentingly
Morose People (GRUMP).
</P>
<P>
   Our logo will be the face of a grumbly person behind the
international ``no'' sign. We will have T-shirts, hats and bumper
stickers.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to join, please e-mail me or call at the address and
phone number printed at the bottom of this column.
</P>
<P>
   GRUMP's goal is to eliminate the humorless by holding them down
and tickling them until they stop whining. Or sentencing them to an
evening at a comedy club.
</P>
<P>
   Lord knows there are enough of these out-of-sorts people around
who need chuckle therapy. I hear from them almost daily. This is no
laughing matter.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a week ago Friday, I had a column poking fun at a
study conducted by a geography instructor at Texas A&AMP;M to find out
how hot the massive six-story Aggie Bonfire gets.
</P>
<P>
   In the column, I pointed out that the only practical application
for this research would be to find how long a stick you'd need to
toast a marshmallow on the side of a burning high-rise.
</P>
<P>
   This bulletin just in: I WAS JUST KIDDING.
</P>
<P>
   But the column drew a nasty e-mail from someone identifying
himself as a Ph.D. with an oncology department in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``In reading your article, I wonder if you know the first thing
about science. Or humor for that matter,'' this person wrote. ``I
would be willing to bet you were the type of person who sat in a
science class in grade school, and frustrated with the basic
concepts your teachers were trying to impress upon you, turned your
attentions to crack a joke about the obese boy in the front of the
class. . . . ``
</P>
<P>
   Oncology is the branch of medicine dealing with tumors. So I
e-mailed the letter writer and asked, ``Did you say humor or
tumor?''
</P>
<P>
   He probably didn't think that was funny, either.
</P>
<P>
   You can tell when you're dealing with the chronically humorless
because they leave clues. One strong clue is the claim by the
writer that he has a great sense of humor. It's just that your
attempts at levity were so off-base that this time he didn't join
in the frivolity.
</P>
<P>
   So it was no surprise when the writer said in his letter, ``As
far as humor goes, while I might not be a stand-up comedian, I can
laugh and joke with the best of them.''
</P>
<P>
   What this usually means is that the person's lips crack when he
smiles. Humorless people live in a state of denial.
</P>
<P>
   Another trait humorless people share is the claim that everyone
sees it their way.
</P>
<P>
   Early this month, I wrote a tongue-in-cheek column saying that
since the government provides habitat for endangered species such
as the golden-cheeked warbler, shouldn't it do the same for the
endangered Texas Yellow Dog Democrat? This brought a testy e-mail
retort from D.E. Kissman of Austin. Kissman was upset because my
column had ``stepped over the line'' by classifying ``Texas Yellow
Dog Democrats with ANIMALS.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. John Kelso's letter of November 6, in reference to . . .
Texas Yellow Dog Democrats, is an insult to all loyal Texas
Democrats,'' Kissman wrote.
</P>
<P>
   All? I'm waiting to hear from another Yellow Dog Democrat who
was insulted. When I do, GRUMP will recommend two aspirin, and
three hours of sucking the helium out of party balloons and talking
funny.

 &HT;    Wanted fugitive caught _ but not on tape
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ On Thanksgiving Day, I refused to let anyone take
my picture. Bad hair day, I pleaded.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky for me, no one called the cops.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky for all of us, the family of James Lawson's new girlfriend
did. Grandma got suspicious over Lawson's vehement refusal to be
videotaped when he came for Thanksgiving dinner in Indiana. The
folks didn't know him well enough to grant the grace of a bad hair
day.
</P>
<P>
   Until Saturday, with the news of the fugitive's capture _
essentially at the hands of a nosy grandmother _ Lawson's case was
hardly one that inspired faith in the family. His mother, Ellen Kay
Peck of Middletown, has pleaded guilty to helping bury the body
parts of the victim, Cheryl Ann Durkin.
</P>
<P>
   Peck's gruesome act _ burying body parts that had been cut up
with a power saw _ showed family loyalty at its worst.
</P>
<P>
   Grandma's hunch shows family loyalty at its aggressive,
intrusive, buttinsky best. We don't know anything about her yet,
but we all know grandmas and grandpas, moms and dads, aunts and
uncles like her. We chafe at their overprotective love _ and we'd
be forlorn without it.
</P>
<P>
   Remember being in high school and wondering, ``What gives them
the right to ask what time I'm coming in? What concern is it of
theirs if I've done my homework or not?'' You couldn't wait for the
day when your life was nobody's business but your own.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years or so later, it hits you: That day never came. Mom
still calls the second you're scheduled to come home from a trip.
She knows you're pregnant before you do. She reminds you when it's
time to renew your license plates. She critiques your social
schedule when she considers it overbooked.
</P>
<P>
   Most families act as a second skin that protects us from the
evil in the world. Ellen Kay Peck inverted that sacred trust,
breaking the law to protect her son.
</P>
<P>
   Most families also serve as superego, a far better enforcer of
conscience than any revised code. Cover up for a crime? You're
lucky if they give you slack for missing Sunday dinner.
</P>
<P>
   So Peck's is a ``What is this world coming to?'' crime. What
kind of mother would protect her son by leaving others in danger?
(Lawson did not return her devotion, staying on the lam after
authorities slapped his mother with $1 million bail.)
</P>
<P>
   How reassuring, then, that this story also offers an example of
a family working the way it should. Grandma became suspicious of
new boyfriend. She was nosy enough to find out that boyfriend had a
Middletown connection, and that's what she told Indiana State
Police when she called the next day.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't discreetly look the other way. She did what was
necessary to protect her granddaughter. She did what was right.
</P>
<P>
   Lawson's skittish reaction to the camcorder reveals how little
he understood this kind of family. It was his suspicion of normal
family rituals, ironically, that tripped him up.
</P>
<P>
   Three cheers for grandma, and for all those who care about us
even when it would be more convenient if they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose she had called her granddaughter. Suppose her
granddaughter had said, ``Mind your own business.''
</P>
<P>
   I can picture her stout reply: ``I am.''

 &HT;    A black 'leader' abandons his own
 &HT;    By Stebbins Jefferson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Maybe it's the holiday season of
thanksgiving, good cheer and the prospect of a new year. Whatever
the reasons, after the fall elections, I tend to adopt a hopeful
attitude that the winning candidates, even if they weren't my
choice, will serve all citizens equally well.
</P>
<P>
   That posture has certainly been my response to the election of
Jeb Bush as governor. But before we move forward, political
analysts insist on looking back, especially at the campaign issues
related to race.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, The Orlando Sentinel published a study of how
blacks in Florida's seven largest urban counties voted in the
gubernatorial election. Reviewing precincts where at least 75
percent of the registered voters are black, the paper reported that
while Mr. Bush campaigned heavily in black neighborhoods, he
received only 7.52 percent of those votes. That wasn't much of an
increase over the 5.77 percent he got in 1994, when he said that,
if elected, he would do ``probably nothing'' for blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Bush's supporters say the numbers don't tell the whole story
because they don't include the thousands of blacks who live in
predominantly white neighborhoods. There is some validity in that
argument. In fact, I wonder whether a study of voting patterns
based on income would be more instructive in uniting our democracy
than one based on race.
</P>
<P>
   Still, understanding why Mr. Bush lost the black urban vote
should concern all of us. Since a governor cannot know first-hand
every constituency, he must rely on key supporters who do. In
seeking advice about inner-city residents, however, I hope the
governor-elect looks beyond Rep. Willie Logan, D-Opa-locka, who
campaigned for the Republican candidate after Democrats ousted him
in January as the House's first black leader.
</P>
<P>
   In this post-election debate as to why Mr. Bush lost the inner
cities, Rep. Logan's explanation rings with the kind of prejudice
that would bring howls of criticism were he white. ``Bush would
have been more attractive to African-Americans who are more
informed and more willing to make decisions based on information
rather than emotional attachment,'' Rep. Logan told The Associated
Press. ``That means African-Americans who don't live in the urban
core area.''
</P>
<P>
   With that statement, he dismisses every voter still living in
the ghetto, the older neighborhoods to which almost every black
citizen can trace his roots. Integration of residential areas is so
new that the reasons many blacks remain in predominantly black
neighborhoods are too complex to be explained as a lack of
education or a propensity to be ruled by emotion rather than
intelligence. Nor can one generalize that a suburban address
automatically makes one more capable of logical reasoning. Thus,
Rep. Logan insults every black Floridian by suggesting such to be
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Most disturbing, his mentality reflects a bias which, if widely
adopted, could instruct that only blacks who live among whites are
worthy of dignity and respect. That line of thought indicts blacks
in the ghetto as incapable of making rational decisions because
they haven't gotten themselves out.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the same kind of simple-minded, race-based classism
separates poor, inner-city kids from those who live in middle-class
suburban neighborhoods. Many black children from ``the core area''
often generalize that all suburbanite black kids consider
themselves superior. The schism grows wider because far too many
middle-class kids assume themselves to be inherently better than
all poor blacks simply because of circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   At that point of mutual rejection, communication breaks down
between the two groups, which desperately need each other's support
to eliminate the race-based obstacles that continue to be a part of
our lives. The strength of the black community derives from an
acknowledgment of our common identity. When we impose divisive
stereotypes on each other, we all lose.

 &HT;    Animals still pile up at nation's shelters despite new policies
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ While this planet's children continue to die from
starvation and disease, soft-hearted Americans are pouring millions
into an effort to ensure nutritious meals, loving homes and
litter-to-grave health care for every dog and cat in this nation.
</P>
<P>
   That's unfair, of course, but it's also true.
</P>
<P>
   The hypocrisy of animal rights extremists has always been great
fun. Animal rights activists will splatter red paint on the mink
coats of startled rich women but ignore the leather work boots worn
by construction workers across the street.
</P>
<P>
   Or they will protest the raising and killing of livestock for
human consumption while feeding their carnivore pets food processed
from those same animals.
</P>
<P>
   Activists who force vegetarian diets on their dogs and cats
should be cited for animal cruelty.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past several years animal-rights fundamentalists have
honed their doctrine so thin that they have declared a jihad
against America's greatest protector of animals, the Humane Society
of the United States, the American Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals, the American Humane Association and the
thousands of small, non-profit animal shelters across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   It started in California, which should surprise no one. A
gathering of animal-rights ayatollahs in San Francisco decreed that
it is morally indefensible for animal shelters to be involved in
the euthanasia of any animal that has any chance of being adopted.
Period.
</P>
<P>
   No slack is given due to lack of funds, space or people willing
to adopt. Also no credit for the millions of animals that have been
saved or the passage of a long list of significant legislation that
promotes the humane treatment of animals.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that every humane organization and animal shelter in
the nation has worked for generations to educate the public to spay
and neuter their pets to reduce the number of animals dropped off
in animal shelters.
</P>
<P>
   The first ``no-kill'' animal shelter in the United States was
completed last year by the San Francisco Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals. No animal that can be nursed back to health,
trained and adopted will be killed.
</P>
<P>
   That's great except hypersensitive animal lovers now use the
abundantly funded luxury adoption facility in San Francisco to
attack animal shelters that also do not have ``no-kill'' policies.
</P>
<P>
   More practical animal welfare officials, such as Roger A. Caras,
president of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, have called ``no-kill'' more a hoax than a fact.
</P>
<P>
   The hoax is that San Francisco SPCA officials can only claim
they are a ``no-kill'' facility by turning away animals they deem
not adoptable. The city's animal control officers now offer all the
strays they pick up to the ``no kill'' facility but still have to
destroy nearly 6,000 animals annually.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent article in the Dallas Morning News by
special contributor Jane Meredith Adams, an animal-loving
California billionaire has plunked down $200 million to promote
no-kill animal shelters nationwide. David Duffield, co-founder of
PeopleSoft software, and his wife, Cheryl, established the
$200-million foundation in memory of Maddie, their miniature
schnauzer.
</P>
<P>
   If enough billionaires, millionaires and just plain folks kick
in enough money, it's likely that America will become the first
nation to come close to guaranteeing a long and healthy life for
every dog and cat.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. animal shelters receive more than 5 million dogs and more
than 4 million cats each year, according to the American Humane
Association. Only a third of those animals find homes. The
remaining 6 million are euthanized.
</P>
<P>
   No-kill is a wonderful goal. Next we can work on the starving
children.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;(AT)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is Arianna Huffington's background? I thought she was
just the wife of an aspiring politician, but I see her on TV talk
shows all the time.
</P>
<P>
   A: Huffington, 47, was born in Greece and moved to England when
she was 16. She graduated from Cambridge University with a degree
in economics. She's now a nationally syndicated columnist and
author of a number of books, including ``The Woman Behind the
Legend,'' a biography of Maria Callas; ``Picasso: Creator and
Destroyer,'' which became an international best-seller and the
basis of the film ``Surviving Picasso''; ``The Female Woman'';
``After Reason''; ``Greetings From the Lincoln Bedroom,'' a book of
political satire; and ``The Fourth Instinct.''
</P>
<P>
   She has been described as having huge political ambitions. Her
ex-husband, Michael Huffington, was a Republican congressman from
California who spent $30 million of his own oil fortune in losing a
1994 Senate race to incumbent Democrat Dianne Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   Huffington had bought a $4.3 million home in Montecito, near
Santa Barbara, in 1988. He joined Arianna there only on weekends in
1988, 1989, and 1990, remaining in Houston during the week to run
his family's oil business. But he officially switched his residency
to California in 1991, and entered politics. The Huffingtons
divorced in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will you settle this question once and for all: How do you
pronounce the name of Brett Favre of the Green Bay Packers? We have
had endless discussions about it.
</P>
<P>
   A: You're not the only one who isn't sure, judging by how many
times the quarterback's name is mangled on the air. For the record,
it's pronounced ``Fahv,'' not ``FAV-re'' or, as some even say,
``FAR-ve.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was former Sen. Bob Dole's injury in World War II? What
were his awards?
</P>
<P>
   A: As an Army second lieutenant, Dole was leading an assault on
a last-ditch German machine gun nest in the Po Valley of Italy on
April 14, 1945, when he was struck by an exploding shell that
destroyed his right shoulder, fractured vertebrae in his neck and
spine, and riddled his body with metal slivers. It happened just
three days before V-E Day.
</P>
<P>
   He was told that he might never walk again, but over the course
of three years in Army hospitals, and several major operations, he
began standing and cautiously moving about. His right arm and hand
were beyond recuperation, but his left hand had some residual
feeling and he gradually mastered its use.
</P>
<P>
   He was awarded two Purple Hearts and a bronze star with two
clusters.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A friend of mine will be 100 years old soon. How can I
contact Willard Scott of the ``Today'' show, so he can mention this
milestone birthday?
</P>
<P>
   A: Send a letter several weeks in advance with the person's
name, date the person will be 100, and a photo, to: Willard Scott,
c/o NBC News ``Today,'' 30 Rockefeller Plaza, Room 304, New York,
NY 10112. Or, if time is running short, you could fax the
information to Allison Gollust, publicist for ``Today,'' at
212-664-4426. It isn't always possible for every candidate to be
mentioned on the air, NBC reminds viewers, especially when the
information is provided on short notice.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is caffeine, and how is something decaffeinated?
</P>
<P>
   A: Grab a cup of java as you wade through this short
dissertation. Caffeine is considered a mild stimulant. It affects
the central nervous system. In high doses, it can cause rapid
heartbeat, insomnia and anxiety. The substance is quickly absorbed,
reaching the body cells in 15 to 45 minutes, depending on the
person.
</P>
<P>
   Caffeine occurs naturally in coffee, tea and cocoa. Moderate
doses of caffeine, up to three cups of coffee a day, are generally
considered safe for most people. A drug-like dose, in something
like Vivarin or NoDoz, is 100 milligrams. The stimulant also is
used in pain relievers like Anacin (32 milligrams) and Excedrin (65
milligrams). A 5-ounce cup of brewed coffee contains between 110
and 150 milligrams; a cup of instant coffee has 64 to 124
milligrams; a cup of brewed tea has between 20 and 90 milligrams; a
12-ounce glass of cola has about 60 milligrams; and a glass of
chocolate milk has about 7 milligrams.
</P>
<P>
   For a coffee to be ``decaffeinated,'' it must have 97 percent of
its caffeine removed. In one method, unroasted beans are softened
by steam and washed by a solvent that removes the caffeine.
Decaffeination agents include carbon dioxide; ethyl acetate, a
substance that occurs naturally in many fruits; methylene chloride,
a solvent; fats and oils; and water. The process starts with
softening the green, unroasted beans in the agents, after which
they're ``agitated'' to draw the caffeine away. Then the beans are
heated and blown with steam, followed by roasting.

<P>
   Q: I recently cleaned out a safe deposit box and there was a $10
bill, ripped but not completely. It was dated 1934, series A. I
went to the bank and included it in some payments and the teller
gave it back thinking it was worth more than face value. Is it?
</P>
<P>
   A: As it was 64 years ago, the answer is still 10 bucks ``unless
it was in mint condition,'' said Larry Jackson, an authority on
rare coins and money. If it were in perfect condition, a dealer or
collector might pay $20. Jackson said large quantities of similar
bills from that era, in various conditions, constantly are emerging
from storage. ``It would have been worth more if the person had
invested it rather than put it in a safe deposit box,'' Jackson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you tell me how to contact Attorney General Janet Reno to
express my anger at her for not requesting an independent counsel
to investigate Vice President Al Gore and his campaign finance
problems?
</P>
<P>
   A: Address a letter to Reno and send it to: U.S. Justice
Department, 950 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20530-0001.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When soldiers are referred to as GIs, what does that mean and
what is the origin?
</P>
<P>
   A: One of the popular explanations is that it refers to the term
Government Issue or General Issue, abbreviated GI, that was common
in mid-1930s. Before that, heavy Army garbage cans were known as GI
cans, referring to the material they were made of: galvanized iron.
On June 17, 1942, in a comic strip for the Army weekly Yank, David
Bregar used the term ``GI Joe'' to mean enlisted men. The phrase
later was shortened to GI. The use of ``GI'' to mean soldiers, and
pertaining to the Army only, gained notoriety after the death of
war correspondent Ernie Pyle in 1945, according to the book
``Speaking Freely: A Guided Tour of American English from Plymouth
Rock to Silicon Valley.'' But after Pyle was killed by Japanese
gunfire, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower said, ``Every GI in Europe, and
that means all of us, has lost one of his best friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I think there was a famous statesman who had the poem used in
the movie ``Four Weddings and a Funeral'' read at his wake. Could
you repeat it, or at least print the poet's name? And who was the
statesman?
</P>
<P>
   A: The poem was written by English-born writer Wystan Hugh
Auden. He was born in 1907 and immigrated to the United States in
1939. Actor John Hannah read Auden's ``Funeral Blues'' in the
movie:
</P>
<P>
   Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone,/ Prevent the dog
from barking with a juicy bone,/ Silence the pianos and with
muffled drum/ Bring out the coffin, let the mourners come./ Let
aeroplanes circle moaning overhead/ Scribbling on the sky the
message He Is Dead./ Put crepe bows round the white necks of public
doves,/ Let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves./ He was
my North, my South, my East and West./ My working week and my
Sunday rest,/
</P>
<P>
   My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song;/ I thought that love
would last forever; I was wrong./ The stars are not wanted now: Put
out every one;/ Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun;/ Pour away
the ocean and sweep up the wood;/ For nothing now can ever come to
any good.
</P>
<P>
   As for the poem being read at a statesman's wake, Nicholas
Jenkins, a Stanford English professor and co-chair of the W.H.
Auden Society, said you may be referring to the lead editorial of
the London Times printed shortly after Princess Diana's death. The
Auden piece was quoted and described as a ``fitting note'' for a
period of great national mourning.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My husband and I have a little wager on this question. In the
last 30 years, how many high school basketball players have skipped
college and gone straight to the pros?
</P>
<P>
   A: Since 1968, the National Basketball Association has counted
on its rosters eight players who entered the league straight from
high school. This does not include the three high school players
taken during the June 1998 draft, though they will be added if they
make the cut with their teams, said NBA spokesman Evan Silverman.
In June, Al Harrington of Elizabeth, N.J., who was heavily
recruited by Georgia Tech, was taken in the NBA's first round by
the Indiana Pacers. Harrington was the No. 25 pick overall. In the
second round, high school players Rashard Lewis (Seattle
Supersonics, No. 32 overall) and Korleone Young (Detroit Pistons,
No. 40 overall) also were drafted.
</P>
<P>
   As for the eight players who preceded them, the NBA lists the
following: Reggie Harding with Detroit and Indiana (ABA); Moses
Malone with Utah (ABA) and San Antonio; Bill Willoughby with
Atlanta and New Jersey; Darryl Dawkins with Philadelphia and
Detroit; Kevin Garnett with Minnesota; Kobe Bryant with the Los
Angeles Lakers; Jermaine O'Neal with Portland; and Tracy McGrady
with Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Several players in the 1940s and 1950s did not play college ball
and went straight to pro teams. But that's considered a separate
time from the modern era of basketball, Silverman said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the net income of residents on the island of Guam?
What is their currency? Is it the American dollar or do they have
their own money?
</P>
<P>
   A: According to the 1997 Central Intelligence Agency World
Factbook, estimated per capita income for 1996 in Guam was $19,000.
The island's currency is the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Q: With the buyout of Netscape by America Online, who will
provide libraries, schools and universities with Internet service?
</P>
<P>
   A: Netscape is a World Wide Web browser and does not provide
connectivity to the Internet. That is done by Internet service
providers such as America Online or Atlanta-based MindSpring.
Browsers such as Netscape allow users to access the Web, but the
user must already be connected to the Internet. MindSpring, which
has more than 600,000 customers nationwide, will continue to
provide connection service to libraries, schools and universities
at a reduced price, said company spokesman Ed Hansen. Free Internet
connection for educational institutions is provided through a
federal grant program, Hansen said. That will not change, either.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who is on the board of directors for America Online?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 10-member board of directors consists of: Stephen M.
Case, chairman of the board and chief executive officer of America
Online; Daniel F. Akerson, chairman and CEO of Nextel
Communications Inc.; Frank J. Caufield, general partner of Kleiner
Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers; Robert J. Frankenberg, president and CEO
of Encanto Networks Inc.; Alexander M. Haig Jr., former White House
chief of staff and now chairman and president of Worldwide
Associates Inc.; William N. Melton, president and CEO of
CyberCashcq Inc.; Thomas Middelhoff, chairman and CEO of
Bertelsmann AG; Robert W. Pittman, presint and chief operating
officer of America Online; Colin L. Powell, former chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff and now chairman of America's Promise: The
Alliance for Youth; and Franklin D. Raines, former White House
budget director and now chairman and CEO-designate of Fannie Mae.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I admire and respect Susan McDougal and would like to write
her. Could you provide a mailing address?
</P>
<P>
   A: You can send McDougal mail via her attorney, Mark Geragos, at
201 N. Figueroa Blvd., Suite 500, Los Angeles, Calif., 90012.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to the young boy whose father abducted him
and tried to keep him alive on lettuce and water?
</P>
<P>
   A: The child you refer to is 22-month-old David Fink, whose
parents are members of a religious cult. His parents believed he
was ``the Christ Child'' and fed him only lettuce and watermelon in
an attempt to keep him pure, authorities said. David currently is
in foster care in Utah, said FBI Special Agent George Dougherty.
David's parents, Christopher and Kyndra, were arrested and charged
with kidnapping and aggravated assaulted. The latter charge is the
result of injuries a nurse's aide sustained when she tried to stop
the couple from taking David from a Salt Lake City hospital. The
child had been admitted for malnourishment by Kyndra Fink's family.
At the time, David weighed 16 pounds the size of an average
6-month-old. For more than two weeks, the couple eluded authorities
before they were captured in a remote part of Montana. The parents
await trial and are free on bond, Dougherty said.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail

</P>
<P>
   Q: What is Arianna Huffington's background? I thought she was
just the wife of an aspiring politician, but I see her on TV talk
shows all the time.
</P>
<P>
   A: Huffington, 47, was born in Greece and moved to England when
she was 16. She graduated from Cambridge University with a degree
in economics. She's now a nationally syndicated columnist and
author of a number of books, including ``The Woman Behind the
Legend,'' a biography of Maria Callas; ``Picasso: Creator and
Destroyer,'' which became an international best-seller and the
basis of the film ``Surviving Picasso''; ``The Female Woman'';
``After Reason''; ``Greetings From the Lincoln Bedroom,'' a book of
political satire; and ``The Fourth Instinct.''
</P>
<P>
   She has been described as having huge political ambitions. Her
ex-husband, Michael Huffington, was a Republican congressman from
California who spent $30 million of his own oil fortune in losing a
1994 Senate race to incumbent Democrat Dianne Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   Huffington had bought a $4.3 million home in Montecito, near
Santa Barbara, in 1988. He joined Arianna there only on weekends in
1988, 1989, and 1990, remaining in Houston during the week to run
his family's oil business. But he officially switched his residency
to California in 1991, and entered politics. The Huffingtons
divorced in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will you settle this question once and for all: How do you
pronounce the name of Brett Favre of the Green Bay Packers? We have
had endless discussions about it.
</P>
<P>
   A: You're not the only one who isn't sure, judging by how many
times the quarterback's name is mangled on the air. For the record,
it's pronounced ``Fahv,'' not ``FAV-re'' or, as some even say,
``FAR-ve.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was former Sen. Bob Dole's injury in World War II? What
were his awards?
</P>
<P>
   A: As an Army second lieutenant, Dole was leading an assault on
a last-ditch German machine gun nest in the Po Valley of Italy on
April 14, 1945, when he was struck by an exploding shell that
destroyed his right shoulder, fractured vertebrae in his neck and
spine, and riddled his body with metal slivers. It happened just
three days before V-E Day.
</P>
<P>
   He was told that he might never walk again, but over the course
of three years in Army hospitals, and several major operations, he
began standing and cautiously moving about. His right arm and hand
were beyond recuperation, but his left hand had some residual
feeling and he gradually mastered its use.
</P>
<P>
   He was awarded two Purple Hearts and a bronze star with two
clusters.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A friend of mine will be 100 years old soon. How can I
contact Willard Scott of the ``Today'' show, so he can mention this
milestone birthday?
</P>
<P>
   A: Send a letter several weeks in advance with the person's
name, date the person will be 100, and a photo, to: Willard Scott,
c/o NBC News ``Today,'' 30 Rockefeller Plaza, Room 304, New York,
NY 10112. Or, if time is running short, you could fax the
information to Allison Gollust, publicist for ``Today,'' at
212-664-4426. It isn't always possible for every candidate to be
mentioned on the air, NBC reminds viewers, especially when the
information is provided on short notice.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is caffeine, and how is something decaffeinated?
</P>
<P>
   A: Grab a cup of java as you wade through this short
dissertation. Caffeine is considered a mild stimulant. It affects
the central nervous system. In high doses, it can cause rapid
heartbeat, insomnia and anxiety. The substance is quickly absorbed,
reaching the body cells in 15 to 45 minutes, depending on the
person.
</P>
<P>
   Caffeine occurs naturally in coffee, tea and cocoa. Moderate
doses of caffeine, up to three cups of coffee a day, are generally
considered safe for most people. A drug-like dose, in something
like Vivarin or NoDoz, is 100 milligrams. The stimulant also is
used in pain relievers like Anacin (32 milligrams) and Excedrin (65
milligrams). A 5-ounce cup of brewed coffee contains between 110
and 150 milligrams; a cup of instant coffee has 64 to 124
milligrams; a cup of brewed tea has between 20 and 90 milligrams; a
12-ounce glass of cola has about 60 milligrams; and a glass of
chocolate milk has about 7 milligrams.
</P>
<P>
   For a coffee to be ``decaffeinated,'' it must have 97 percent of
its caffeine removed. In one method, unroasted beans are softened
by steam and washed by a solvent that removes the caffeine.
Decaffeination agents include carbon dioxide; ethyl acetate, a
substance that occurs naturally in many fruits; methylene chloride,
a solvent; fats and oils; and water. The process starts with
softening the green, unroasted beans in the agents, after which
they're ``agitated'' to draw the caffeine away. Then the beans are
heated and blown with steam, followed by roasting.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently cleaned out a safe deposit box and there was a $10
bill, ripped but not completely. It was dated 1934, series A. I
went to the bank and included it in some payments and the teller
gave it back thinking it was worth more than face value. Is it?
</P>
<P>
   A: As it was 64 years ago, the answer is still 10 bucks ``unless
it was in mint condition,'' said Larry Jackson, an authority on
rare coins and money. If it were in perfect condition, a dealer or
collector might pay $20. Jackson said large quantities of similar
bills from that era, in various conditions, constantly are emerging
from storage. ``It would have been worth more if the person had
invested it rather than put it in a safe deposit box,'' Jackson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you tell me how to contact Attorney General Janet Reno to
express my anger at her for not requesting an independent counsel
to investigate Vice President Al Gore and his campaign finance
problems?
</P>
<P>
   A: Address a letter to Reno and send it to: U.S. Justice
Department, 950 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20530-0001.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When soldiers are referred to as GIs, what does that mean and
what is the origin?
</P>
<P>
   A: One of the popular explanations is that it refers to the term
Government Issue or General Issue, abbreviated GI, that was common
in mid-1930s. Before that, heavy Army garbage cans were known as GI
cans, referring to the material they were made of: galvanized iron.
On June 17, 1942, in a comic strip for the Army weekly Yank, David
Bregar used the term ``GI Joe'' to mean enlisted men. The phrase
later was shortened to GI. The use of ``GI'' to mean soldiers, and

doves,/ Let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves./ He was
my North, my South, my East and West./ My working week and my

out every one;/ Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun;/ Pour away
the ocean and sweep up the wood;/ For nothing now can ever come to
any good.
</P>
<P>
   As for the poem being read at a statesman's wake, Nicholas
Jenkins, a Stanford English professor and co-chair of the W.H.
Auden Society, said you may be referring to the lead editorial of
the London Times printed shortly after Princess Diana's death. The
Auden piece was quoted and described as a ``fitting note'' for a

</P>
<P>
   Q: My husband and I have a little wager on this question. In the

with Toronto.

 &HT;    Doing battle against lice
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If your kids come home with head lice, don't expect a quick
solution. Here are a few pointers I can offer from experience:
</P>
<P>
   _ Use the lice-killing shampoo. While common over-the-counter
pediculicides are only 70 percent to 80 percent effective at
killing the eggs, that's the only way to start. Most contain
pyrethrum, a naturally occurring pesticide derived from
chrysanthemum flowers. Lindane, the prescription pesticide used for
pubic lice, is considered somewhat toxic and should be used only as
a last resort.
</P>
<P>
   _ Get a metal comb. Those plastic combs that come with
lice-killing shampoo are practically useless at trapping nits. Give
it to your daughter so she can disinfest Barbie's hair while you
work on hers with a sturdy metal comb, which costs about $5.
</P>
<P>
   _ Get a few small plastic hair clips and a fine-tooth plastic
comb with a long handle. You can and will learn to part and repart
the kids' hair like a stylist cutting a shag.
</P>
<P>
   _ Every night: Get the children sitting in position with water,
toys and treats. Comb their hair out with a regular comb. Check the
scalp thoroughly for live and dead lice, pick them out and put them
in a cup of water. Next, nits. Take a small ( 1/2-inch to 1-inch)
bunch of hair, and scrape the nit-removal comb through it, making
sure the shafts of hair push against the top of the comb. Check the
hair carefully and pick out nits the comb misses; deposit in the
cup of water. Repeat with the next bunch of hair.
</P>
<P>
   _ Change kids' sheets and pillowcases every night for the first
week. Then change their pillowcases every night until the nits are
history. Good luck: You'll need it.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, call the National Pediculosis Association
at 1-800-446-4672 or visit the nonprofit agency's Web site:

 &HT;    Head lice: It takes patience to rid your home of persistent pest
 &HT;    By John Kessler
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Come to school right away. Your child has head lice.
</P>
<P>
   What's the big deal, you wonder? It's a simple matter of giving
them a shampoo treatment and running a load or two of laundry.
</P>
<P>
   Hah. Getting rid of head lice takes more time and energy than
Brownie troop, soccer meets and choir practice combined. These
microscopic pests can and will turn your household upside down.
</P>
<P>
   Our ordeal started when our eldest daughter failed a routine
head check, along with her entire second-grade clique, a few weeks
ago. All three girls had to stay home until their flowing hair was
free not only of live lice but also of nits.
</P>
<P>
   Nits? Those itty-bitty white egg sacks that attach to a strand
of hair and wait seven days to hatch. At first glance they appear
to be a piece of fluff or a speck of dandruff, but smaller. Though
they look innocuous, don't be taken in. They're your lethal enemy.
</P>
<P>
   And they're particularly hard to spot in the kind of fine, fair
hair that our three daughters have. Oldest daughter has luxuriant
tresses down to the small of her back. Middle daughter would look
like a Botticelli angel if we could ever comb out her rat's nest.
Baby daughter has pillows of blond fluff. We're the head lice
poster family.
</P>
<P>
   But, we thought foolishly, all we had to do was follow the
instructions on our $17.99 over-the-counter lice kit, and we'd be
done with it. So we washed the whole family's hair with
foul-smelling lice shampoo. We combed it all out with dinky plastic
rakes to trap nits. We changed all the sheets, sprayed the
mattresses, laundered the car seat covers and tied all the
nit-infested blankies and stuffed animals in plastic bags for two
weeks to suffocate the hateful bloodsuckers as soon as they
hatched.
</P>
<P>
   End of problem? Not on your life.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, we got simultaneous calls from the school and the
day care center. The cooties were back.
</P>
<P>
   My first despairing thought: ``Why can't I pay someone else to
do this?''
</P>
<P>
   Surely, somewhere, there must be some sort of lice removal
service. The name for this business is obvious: the Nitpickers.
</P>
<P>
   Just hire a squadron of Type A personalities _ intent little
people armed with steel combs, magnifying glasses, tweezers and
endless reserves of obsessive patience. They could pick to their
hearts' content.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps someone could open a head lice camp, where you could
drop off the children every day for a week until the problem is
eradicated. The staff could combine fun, instructive activity with
thorough head cleansing. Puzzles in the morning, pediculicide in
the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   True, the kids couldn't engage in contact sports or even a
friendly game of telephone. But, well, they could play checkers.
Wearing shower caps. Filled with mineral oil.
</P>
<P>
   I could daydream 1,000 solutions, but here's the miserable
truth: The only way to rid your poor kids of lice is to pick the
nits out one by one. A metal lice comb works much better than a
plastic comb.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing works as well as a thumbnail pressed against the pad
of a forefinger. Strand by strand. Nit by nit. Pick, pick, pick.
</P>
<P>
   You must launch a full-scale offensive and change their bedding
every night until you no longer find nits. We've washed and dried
their ``Lion King'' sheets so many times, and with such religious
fervor, that we're due a visitation from Mufasa.
</P>
<P>
   You must cut unruly hair, no matter how lovely. Middle child
traded in her angelic curls for a smart bob, and nitpicking got a
whole lot easier.
</P>
<P>
   And you must access your inner chimpanzee. I can barely look at
my kids' pretty hair these days without wanting to squat nearby and
paw through it. Because every time I think we've got this thing
licked, I find more nits.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after a month, middle daughter appeared to be nit-free.
A few days ago, we got a call from the day care center.
</P>
<P>
   They're baaaack.

 &HT;    HEALTH BRIEFS: Vaccine against AIDS virus being tested on
thousands
 &HT;    (Eds: A compilation of health stories that moved in the past
week.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   About 30 experimental HIV vaccines are being developed, but only
one, AIDSVAX, has entered Phase III, in which thousands of people
are being tested. In Phase I, a few dozen people are tested; in
Phase II, hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   Only one other HIV vaccine, based on the canarypox virus, is
expected to enter Phase III testing within the next year or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I very much believe that for the vaccine effort to succeed,
we're going to need a lot of vaccine concepts tested
systematically, in both primates and in people,'' said Sam Avrett,
executive director of the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, based in
Washington. ``The question we should be asking is, `Why are there
not more products?'''

   Numbers of children using tobacco higher than expected
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Puffing on a cigarette as he leaned against a
downtown drug store, 17-year-old Rick Short offered a terse
explanation for his unhealthy habit, which he began when he was 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Got to have something in my mouth,'' he said simply.
</P>
<P>
   A study released by the Texas Department of Health found that 43
percent of high school students and nearly a third of middle
schoolers _ including about a fourth of all sixth-graders _ chewed
tobacco or smoked it through a cigarette, cigar, or pipe on at
least one day in the previous month. Researchers describe such
teens as ``current'' users.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen percent of high school students and four percent of
middle schoolers said they smoked or chewed tobacco on 20 of the
past 30 days, which classified them as ``frequent'' users.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials said the numbers were higher than they
expected. They also were surprised by the relatively high number of
teens _ 8 percent of students in both high school and middle school
_ who said they smoked pipes at least once in the past month. The
survey is believed to be the first in the country to ask
specifically about pipe use.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-smoking campaign is all in the family
</P>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Twelve-year-old Kevin Hickman has been after his
mom for months to quit smoking, ever since he learned in his
classes about the dangers of tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Karen Hall, has promised she'll try to kick her
25-year-old habit. But if she doesn't, she'll soon have looming
reminders of her son's wish: 10-foot-high billboards of a poster
Kevin designed for a local anti-smoking campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The poster shows a teen-age girl visiting the grave site of her
mother and crying, ``Mom, I miss you.'' Behind the girl, a talking
cigarette sneers, ``Do you want to die, too?''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin submitted the winning poster among 114 entries from
second- through sixth-graders, where teachers were approached by
the Miami Valley Health Improvement Council for a child's drawing
to be featured in a monthlong billboard campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been thinking about quitting for a long time, but now I
should at least try,'' said Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The billboards will go up in late December at six locations in
Montgomery, Clark and Miami counties, including a site near the
Nutter Center. The advertising tab will be picked up by a $25,000
grant from the Physicians Charitable Foundation of the Miami
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer group brands items as risky for kids
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Some teething rings could be dangerous to a baby's
health, and other toys on the market pose choking hazards for young
children, according to the U.S. Public Interest Research Group.
</P>
<P>
   In its annual survey of dangerous toys, the nonprofit consumer
group cited 20 examples of items it thinks should be discontinued
or carry more prominent warnings.
</P>
<P>
   The teething rings appear on the group's trouble list because
they contain ``pthalates,'' substances that PIRG says can cause
liver and kidney problems and reproductive abnormalities. Specific
teethers named include the Baby Looney Tunes Cooling Ring by
Gerber, the Cool Ring Teether by First Years, the Funny Face
Teether Rattle and Disney Babies Mickey Collection by Playskool and
the Sof'Sport Teether and the Sports Fan Water Teether, both by
Safety First.
</P>
<P>
   The Toy Manufacturers of America, which represents more than 300
toy producers and importers, disputed the claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've looked at the research and the allegations. The toys are
safe. Period,'' said Terri Bartlett, TMA's communications director.
</P>
<P>
   TMA also accused PIRG and other ``self-appointed watchdog
individuals and groups'' of alarming consumers when no real danger
exists.
</P>
<P>
   The PIRG report on the Web:
</P>
<P>
   http://www.uspirg.org/consumer/products/toy/98/index.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Early detection of diabetes urged
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Screening and treating adults earlier for Type 2
diabetes would reduce its most severe complications and result in a
better quality of life, but not a longer life, a study by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found.
</P>
<P>
   A computer analysis published in the Journal of the American
Medical Association found that detecting diabetes earlier in its
onset would reduce the likelihood of kidney failure during a
patient's lifetime by 26 percent, blindness by 35 percent and foot
or leg amputation by 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Using what is known as ``opportunistic'' screening _ adding a
diabetes blood test onto an already scheduled doctor's visit _ on
average found diabetes 5.5 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   However, such a strategy also ends up costing more in health
care dollars, not less, said Dr. Michael Engelgau, CDC medical
epidemiologist. Screening and treating those age 25 and older now
for diabetes instead of waiting until age 45 _ the current
guideline _ would cost about $4,500 more over a person's lifetime,
Engelgau said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some cost reductions from the decrease or delaying
complications, but in the end, it's not a net savings,'' Engelgau
said. ``You actually spend a little bit more on the screening, and
the treatment begins earlier. But you're getting a better value for
your money. It's an improved quality of life.''

 &HT;    Doing battle against lice
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If your kids come home with head lice, don't expect a quick
solution. Here are a few pointers I can offer from experience:
</P>
<P>
   _ Use the lice-killing shampoo. While common over-the-counter
pediculicides are only 70 percent to 80 percent effective at
killing the eggs, that's the only way to start. Most contain
pyrethrum, a naturally occurring pesticide derived from
chrysanthemum flowers. Lindane, the prescription pesticide used for
pubic lice, is considered somewhat toxic and should be used only as
a last resort.
</P>
<P>
   _ Get a metal comb. Those plastic combs that come with
lice-killing shampoo are practically useless at trapping nits. Give
it to your daughter so she can disinfest Barbie's hair while you
work on hers with a sturdy metal comb, which costs about $5.
</P>
<P>
   _ Get a few small plastic hair clips and a fine-tooth plastic
comb with a long handle. You can and will learn to part and repart
the kids' hair like a stylist cutting a shag.
</P>
<P>
   _ Every night: Get the children sitting in position with water,
toys and treats. Comb their hair out with a regular comb. Check the
scalp thoroughly for live and dead lice, pick them out and put them
in a cup of water. Next, nits. Take a small ( 1/2-inch to 1-inch)
bunch of hair, and scrape the nit-removal comb through it, making
sure the shafts of hair push against the top of the comb. Check the
hair carefully and pick out nits the comb misses; deposit in the
cup of water. Repeat with the next bunch of hair.
</P>
<P>
   _ Change kids' sheets and pillowcases every night for the first
week. Then change their pillowcases every night until the nits are
history. Good luck: You'll need it.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, call the National Pediculosis Association
at 1-800-446-4672 or visit the nonprofit agency's Web site:

   ``We've looked at the research and the allegations. The toys are
safe. Period,'' said Terri Bartlett, TMA's communications director.
</P>
<P>
   TMA also accused PIRG and other ``self-appointed watchdog
individuals and groups'' of alarming consumers when no real danger
exists.

   Early detection of diabetes urged
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Screening and treating adults earlier for Type 2
diabetes would reduce its most severe complications and result in a
better quality of life, but not a longer life, a study by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found.
</P>
<P>
   A computer analysis published in the Journal of the American
Medical Association found that detecting diabetes earlier in its
onset would reduce the likelihood of kidney failure during a
patient's lifetime by 26 percent, blindness by 35 percent and foot
or leg amputation by 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Using what is known as ``opportunistic'' screening _ adding a
diabetes blood test onto an already scheduled doctor's visit _ on
average found diabetes 5.5 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   However, such a strategy also ends up costing more in health
care dollars, not less, said Dr. Michael Engelgau, CDC medical
epidemiologist. Screening and treating those age 25 and older now
for diabetes instead of waiting until age 45 _ the current
guideline _ would cost about $4,500 more over a person's lifetime,
Engelgau said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some cost reductions from the decrease or delaying
complications, but in the end, it's not a net savings,'' Engelgau
said. ``You actually spend a little bit more on the screening, and
the treatment begins earlier. But you're getting a better value for
your money. It's an improved quality of life.''

 &HT;    Ohio cities to receive road improvements, thanks to growth
 &HT;    By Steve Bennish
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The new millennium will mean a massive
reconstruction of area highways fueled largely by growth in the
Dayton-Cincinnati area, ambitious plans unveiled earlier this week
by state highway officials show.
</P>
<P>
   The four largest new major Dayton area highway projects to begin
in the year 2000 will cost at least $204 million when the dust
settles and the orange barrels return to hibernation, Ohio
Department of Transportation director Jerry Wray said.
</P>
<P>
   The spending promises to speed commuters, cut down on accidents
and reduce traffic snarls throughout the Miami Valley's most
rapidly growing communities.
</P>
<P>
   The projects _ boosted courtesy of this summer's landmark $216
billion federal highway bill _ include the long-awaited
reconstruction of the Interstate-70/I-75 interchange, widening I-75
to six lanes from Piqua to Troy, building a new interchange on U.S.
35 at North Fairfield Road and widening I-71 from the Ohio 48
intersection in Warren County south of Lebanon to I-275 in Hamilton
County.
</P>
<P>
   By far the biggest of the large-scale projects is the rebuilding
of the I-70/I-75 interchange, pegged to cost at least $107 million
when construction finishes sometime between 2007 and 2010.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intersection is congested, over-capacity and not able to
accommodate the thousands of trucks which use it every day,'' Wray
said.
</P>
<P>
   The project calls for eventually widening ramps to two lanes and
rerouting merging traffic so it won't mix with exiting traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The project is divided into three independent phases, the first
costing $30 million for a new interchange at Brentwood and Wyse
roads. The Little York Road interchange will close, Wray said.
</P>
<P>
   The second phase costing $38 million will replace Little York
and Brown School roads and County Road 25A bridges with four ramps
to improve traffic merges. Sometime after 2003, west- and
east-bound ramps will be upgraded, Wray said.
</P>
<P>
   Further north on I-75 beginning in 2002, ODOT will spend $29
million to widen the highway to six lanes from Piqua to Troy. It is
now four.
</P>
<P>
   ``The area has been rapidly developing and has become
increasingly congested,'' Wray said. The project moved up sharply
among the state's priorities in the last year, said ODOT
spokeswoman Rhonda Higgins.
</P>
<P>
   In Beavercreek on U.S. 35 at North Fairfield Road, ODOT will
spend $20 million to build an interchange with ramps to replace an
intersection just east on I-675. Again, Wray said, new development
has severely strained existing road capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The area has had tremendous residential and commercial
expansion resulting in a high level of traffic congestion,'' he
said. The project will also extend Ohio 835 to North Fairfield
Road.
</P>
<P>
   South of Lebanon on I-71, ODOT plans to spend $44 million
widening the four-lane highway to six lanes from Ohio 48 to the
I-275 loop around Cincinnati. The first phase from I-275 to Western
Row Road could begin as early as late next year. ``That area is
extremely congested _ complete gridlock,'' said ODOT spokeswoman
Kim Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   Another major announcement Tuesday will speed funding to expand
U.S. 35 to a four-lane road from Xenia to the Ohio River through
Jamestown, Washington Courthouse and Chillicothe. Patterson said
the leg of the project from Bickett Road to a mile west of
Jamestown could open by year's end. The next section to a mile west
of the Fayette County line could open by the fall of 2000, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Dave Hobson, R-Springfield, applauded the move. ``''I
am truly pleased to see ODOT's commitment,'' he said.

   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Most families act as a second

</P>
<P>
   A lot of us know people who appear to live on the ``right'' side
of life. Everything works out well for them. They hold good jobs.
They enjoy splendid health. Their relationships with people and the
affairs and activities of their lives seem happy and harmonious.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there are those who somehow manage to get on
the ``wrong'' side of life. There may be times when nothing seems
to work favorably. The good they are seeking appears to have gone
on vacation. And it seems that the harder they try, the further
away from health, happiness, and success they seem to be.
</P>
<P>
   There's a story in the Bible, in John 21:1-6, that describes
this situation somewhat. The disciples went fishing but failed to
make a catch. They toiled throughout the night but caught nothing.
With the coming of daylight, they headed their boat toward the
shore -- tired and discouraged and ready to quit.
</P>
<P>
   But Jesus was standing on the shore, and when the crestfallen
disciples called to him and told him of their failure, he suggested
they try just once more. ``Cast the net on the right side of the
boat, and you will find some,'' he said. The disciples followed
instructions and the story continues, ``... and now they were not
able to haul it (the net) in, for the quantity of fish.''
</P>
<P>
   This story points to something of great importance. Namely, just
as there was a ``right side'' to that fishing boat, so is there
also a ``right side'' to life. What is this right side of life?
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever noticed that when you cheat, or lie, or don't
support a friend, and then realize what you've done, an inner alarm
system goes off? It's a kind of moral wakeup call. What if your
friends knew what you did? How would you feel if your parents found
out? If your best friends found out? If the person you respected
most in the world discovered you had let him down?
</P>
<P>
   Hiding a cruel, selfish, uncaring, or unloving act deep down
inside doesn't make it go away. Often it festers, and you begin to
feel guilty and full of shame. Even if no one knows but you, those
bad feelings come back to haunt you whenever you think about them.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately these bad feelings about ourselves rarely go away
without some kind of self-examination. And it's by experiencing the
emotions and accepting the ramifications of what you've done that
you can begin to accept and change yourself. There are several ways
you can come to terms with yourself.
</P>
<P>
   First, you can admit the truth, even if it's only to yourself
and one other person, perhaps a counselor or a minister. Talking
about a painful situation with someone you trust can pull the
situation out into the open and remove a weight from your mind and
heart. You're being honest and have a chance to forgive yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Second, if it's something that can be corrected by telling the
truth, then do so. The truth in any situation can clear the air.
Speaking the truth is an affirmation of light and can release the
emotions of shame and guilt. It takes a lot of courage to be
honest, and many friendships have deepened because of honesty
between the people involved in a situation.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, you can choose to make a contract with yourself to do
only deeds you can be proud of in the future. This contract is a
commitment to live in your own integrity, regardless of whether or
not others around you choose to live in theirs. Remember that
ultimately you are the one who benefits by living in honor and
integrity. It is a powerful key to good health, good relationships,
and self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   How can you develop this right attitude of mind? Pause in your
efforts, if only for a moment, to adjust your thinking process. In
the Scripture story, the disciples cried, ``Master, we toiled all
night and took nothing!'' You, too, may have been working,
struggling, striving to attain-and succumbed to temptation. But you
don't have to punish yourself.
</P>
<P>
   The short step from ``nowhere'' to ``now here'' is the moment's
pause you take to become still and know the truth.

<P>
   SPORTS-FRANCHISES (San Francisco) _ The annual Forbes magazine
rankings of sports franchises always cause a twitter among our

about athletic achievement, they know better. If they didn't know
better, they'd be sitting next to you at the diner asking you if
you're going to finish that sausage. By RAY RATTO.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-SETTLEMENTS (Jerusalem) _ Despite the passionate talk
from both Jews and Arabs about the sacredness of their land, this
is an era when land is not sacred soil, but a political commodity
to be exploited. Until now, the Israelis have had that privilege.
But Palestinians have generated their own forms of urban sprawl,
paying little attention to how unplanned growth might consume the
very soil that they profess to adore. By ELAINE RUTH FLETCHER.
</P>

A FEW PCS MANAGE TO TRANSCEND THE GENERIC
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c.1998 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a simple truth: For the most part, consumer PCs are
pretty much alike. The very thing that makes systems compatible
with each other _ accepted industry standards _ also renders them
generic.
</P>
<P>
   That puts computer vendors in a tough position. How do they
differentiate their boxes from their competition, and still compete
in price? Some do it with color, others with design, some with
bells and whistles and others by giving specific models a certain
niche.
</P>
<P>
   Here are two consumer desktop PCs that stand out from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Aptiva SE7 _ $2,200, IBM.
</P>
<P>
   The original Aptiva S series, introduced almost two years ago,
was known for three things _ its jet-black styling, its pizza-box
drive module and its astronomical price. IBM has kept only one of
those three features _ the color. The SE7 is more in line with
high-end PC pricing, and no longer has the drive module.
</P>
<P>
   Bravo for the former, boo-hiss for the latter. I really liked
the pizza box, which allowed you to place the Aptiva's mini-tower
under a desk while still providing desktop access to the floppy and
CD-ROM drives. In the SE7, those drives are back in the mini-tower.
</P>
<P>
   The SE7 comes with a 450-megahertz Intel Pentium II chip, a
whopping 16.8-gigabyte hard drive, 128 megabytes of memory, a
DVD-ROM drive, a 56K voice and fax modem, an ATI Rage Pro AGP
graphics card and 16-bit stereo sound.
</P>
<P>
   I tried the system with IBM's snazzy new 15-inch, flat-panel
monitor, which sells for $1,099. It, too, is jet-black, with
stylish control buttons that look like waves. As with most
flat-panel monitors, it's best to use this one in its native
resolution of 1,024-by-768 pixels. Drop down to 800-by-600, and the
text becomes blurry and images seem unfocused.
</P>
<P>
   The system comes with a set of matching speakers that look like
a pair of triangles. They have mediocre sound, fine for basic
multimedia but lacking for action games. They cry out for a
subwoofer.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the SE7 is definitely not a gamer's machine, at least
not in its base configuration. It lacks positional 3-D audio, a
form of surround-sound that's becoming more and more essential for
game-playing. And the graphics card has only a paltry four
megabytes of video memory. To really unleash the system's
substantial muscle on games, I dropped in a Diamond Multimedia
Monster II add-in card, which uses 3Dfx's Voodoo2 chips.
</P>
<P>
   IBM includes a lot of user-friendly software. The SE7 comes with
ViaVoice, the company's voice-recognition software, which converts
your words into text. There also are several programs that make
diagnosing problems and investigating your PC's capabilities a
snap.
</P>
<P>
   Vaio Digital Studio PCV-E302DS _ $1,500, Sony Corp.
</P>
<P>
   With its new Digital Studio line, Sony is trying to link what it
does best _ personal electronics _ with personal computing.
</P>
<P>
   The Digital Studio appeals to those who want to do more with
their PCs than just play games, write letters and surf the Web. If
you've been intrigued by the creative aspects of working with
different kinds of media on a computer, this machine may be for
you.
</P>
<P>
   The model I tried came with a 350-megahertz Pentium II
processor, 64 megabytes of memory, a 10.6-gigabyte hard drive, a 5X
DVD-ROM drive, a Matrox MGA-G200 AGP video card, a 56K fax modem,
and Aureal Positional 3-D audio.
</P>
<P>
   The system arrived with a 17-inch Sony Vaio monitor with an
excellent Trinitron screen, with speakers and a subwoofer built
into the base, that sells for $600.
</P>
<P>
   The computer is one of the few available with what's known as an
IEEE-1394 connection. Sony calls this port an I-Link connection;
other companies use the name FireWire. It's primarily used for
connecting home entertainment devices, such a stereos, videocameras
and CD-ROM players.
</P>
<P>
   Sony combines this port with very simple software for video
editing. Just connect a 1394-equipped videocamera to the computer,
launch the software and grab what you've recorded on tape. You can
then use the software to pick and choose recorded segments, piecing
together a mini-movie.
</P>
<P>
   You can then plug in a CD-ROM or mini-disc recorder and transfer
the finished video, again via the 1394 port.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, if you have one of these recorders for mini-disks _
Sony's proprietary, tiny CD-ROM music format _ there's software on
the PC to make custom discs.
</P>
<P>
   As a computer alone, the Digital Studio is an excellent
performer, though a bit pricey. Other 350-megahertz systems can be
had for about $200 less these days. The video editing software,
which makes this PC different, is very simple; that's both its
downfall and its virtue. Once you get used to this, you'll wish it
could do more.

FRESH BYTES: IF HOLIDAY SEASON MEANS BUYING NEW PC, THERE'S A LOT
TO DIGEST
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    (ital)Welcome back my friends to the show that never ends
 &HT;    We're so glad you could attend
 &HT;    Come inside! Come inside! (endital)
 &HT;    _ Emerson, Lake &AMP; Palmer 
By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c.1998 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Indeed, it never ends.
</P>
<P>
   Computing power gets more powerful, and does so at an increasing
rate. Prices drop just as quickly. Today's technology will be
obsolete tomorrow _ and you can almost take the words ``today'' and
``tomorrow'' literally.
</P>
<P>
   So what's a Christmas-season PC shopper to do? If you're aching
to put a computer under the tree this year, how do you guarantee
that it won't be a doorstop by next Christmas _ or even this
Easter?
</P>
<P>
   First, develop the proper attitude. Realize that, no matter what
you do today, there will always be something better to buy
tomorrow. It's a fact of life about the personal computer industry.
Make peace with it rather than agonize over it.
</P>
<P>
   Second, shop smart. If you buy old technology today, it's not
going to be fresh when you set it up, much less when you try to
load the latest and greatest programs on it a year from now.
</P>
<P>
   While you don't have to spend the astronomical sums you once did
for a modern PC, buying the cheapest you can find is only going to
leave you frustrated sooner rather than later. On the other hand,
depending on how you use a personal computer, you don't have to
overspend to get a machine that will provide you several years of
service.
</P>
<P>
   As it has matured, the computer market has developed into three
main branches.
</P>
<P>
   Budget buyers are looking for a low-cost computer that will do
most of what they want, ranging from managing family finances to
doing work at home to playing games. The sub-$1,000 category of
computers _ which really includes systems up to about $1,200 _ has
been one of the hottest in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   The second branch are buyers who want to do work at home,
operate a home office or want a computer for education. They may be
doing some desktop publishing, working on graphical presentation or
may need to set up a home office. They need a PC that's a bit more
powerful or sophisticated and thus a bit more expensive _ in the
$1,200-$2,000 range.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's the high-end user, usually a computing
enthusiast and/or a hard-core gamer. Typically, these folks use
fancy graphics applications, play state-of-the-art games and may be
willing to pay whatever it takes for faster-than-normal Internet
access. Their systems start at about $1,800 _ and the sky's the
limit.
</P>
<P>
   Budget buyers
</P>
<P>
   Robert Ryan, an editor with Family PC magazine, said budget
systems may be all that most home computer users need. You can
spend the minimum and still get plenty of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``My advice is to spend the minimum amount required to get a
computer that runs the software you want to run today,'' Ryan said
via e-mail. ``With the exception of 3-D games, which appeal to a
small segment of the computer-buying public, I haven't seen a
compelling application that requires more processing power than you
get in a $700 system.''
</P>
<P>
   The systems that a year ago sold for close to $2,000 or more now
cost less than $1,000. Power comes cheap nowadays.
</P>
<P>
   Processor _ Shop for a system with at least a 300-megahertz
processor, which can be easily found in budget systems today. Most
300-Mhz chips in low-cost systems are going to be either Intel's
Celeron, the Advanced Micro Devices K6-2 or a Cyrix MII.
</P>
<P>
   There are two chips to avoid. The original 300-Mhz Celeron
lacked an onboard cache _ a kind of buffer that speeds up the
movement of data into and out of the chip. The latest 300-Mhz
Celeron that comes with a cache is called the 300A.
</P>
<P>
   Also, stay away from Cyrix's MediaGX chip, which robs at least 2
megabytes of system memory for use with graphics. That means if you
buy a computer with 32 MB of memory, only 30 MB is available to run
programs. Many of the super-cheap PCs that sell for as little as
$399 use this chip.
</P>
<P>
   Memory _ Remember that the more random access memory your
computer has, the faster and smoother it will run. Thirty-two MB is
the minimum, but RAM is so inexpensive these days that
computer-makers are loading up their low-end products with 48, 64
and even 96 MB of memory.
</P>
<P>
   However, memory prices are forecast to recover in 1999, so it's
smart to get as much memory as you can afford now. It may not be
this cheap again.
</P>
<P>
   Hard drives _ As with memory, hard drives are very inexpensive.
That makes it easy to recommend a minimum 4-gigabyte hard drive for
budget systems _ most have this size, or larger.
</P>
<P>
   CD-ROM drive _ Most budget PCs do not come with DVD-ROM, the
new, higher-capacity compact disk format for data and movies. That
makes your choice here easy. Look for a standard CD-ROM drive with
a maximum speed of 24X _ meaning it's 24 times faster than the
original CD-ROM drives.
</P>
<P>
   Modem _ Again, your choice is easy here. All computers sold
today come with a fast 56K fax modem.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these, unfortunately, are a low-cost type known as a
winmodem. With a traditional modem, the commands used to control
the device are stored on chips on the modem. But with a winmodem,
these instructions are stored as a file on the computer's hard
drive. When the PC launches the Windows operating system, the
instructions are loaded into the modem.
</P>
<P>
   Winmodems are notoriously flaky. Reading the comp.dcom.modems
news group on Usenet on the Internet, you can find dozens of cries
for help from owners of these modems. If you can find a budget PC
that does not have a winmodem, and its specifications are
acceptable, buy it.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is, however, that because the ``guts'' of a
winmodem are software-based, they can be upgraded just by applying
a software patch. If you own a winmodem that has difficulty making
or maintaining a connection to other computers, frequently check
the manufacturer's Web site for new updates.
</P>
<P>
   Video _ Look for a budget system that has at least 2 MB of video
memory. Most low-cost computers have at least that much, but if you
can find one with 4 MB, consider that a plus. The more video memory
on a graphics card, the more colors your PC can display at higher
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   You should also insist on a video card that can handle 3-D
graphics for games. It should be compatible with Microsoft's
DirectX graphics system.
</P>
<P>
   Audio _ Nearly all PCs sold today come with 16-bit, wavetable
sound (for realistic music) and a set of adequate speakers.
However, a growing trend is positional audio, which creates a 3-D
effect. Some games that support positional audio, for example, can
make sounds that seem to come from behind you. It's a neat feature
to have if you want to play games, and merely an option to consider
if you don't.
</P>
<P>
   Monitor _ Most budget systems don't come with a monitor, so the
category name ``sub-$1,000'' is often a misnomer. But as with PCs
themselves, the cost of monitors _ particularly smaller ones _ has
been dropping.
</P>
<P>
   You should look for at least a 15-inch monitor that has a
maximum dot pitch of .28mm. The dot pitch refers to how close the
screen's pixels _ the tiny dots that make up an image _ are to each
other. The smaller the number, the better.
</P>
<P>
   You should be able to find a decent 15-inch monitor in the $200
price range.
</P>
<P>
   Slots and ports _ Nearly all PCs today come with Universal
Serial Bus ports, along with the traditional serial and parallel
ports. But you'll want to pay close attention to how many internal
expansion slots a budget PC includes.
</P>
<P>
   Expansion slots are used to add features to a computer. For
example, if you decide you want to buy a scanner, and you want it
to scan images quickly, you'd probably want to consider adding an
SCSI card to your computer. You'd do this by plugging the card into
one of these slots.
</P>
<P>
   There are two primary kinds of slots _ ISA and PCI. The former
is an older design, while PCI is newer and works better with the
Windows Plug &AMP; Play feature. By this time next year, ISA slots will
be a rarity _ they will be gone from most PCs sold starting in 2000
_ but for now you'll want one in your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Thus look for a budget computer with at least one ISA and one
PCI slot. Some budget systems have a shared slot _ you can install
an ISA or a PCI card, but not both _ and you should avoid these.
</P>
<P>
   Basic home/business
</P>
<P>
   Kristina Blachere, an assistant editor with Computers.com _ part
of the CNet family of technology-related Web sites _ advises home
PC buyers to think carefully about how they would use a PC. And
research is very important.
</P>
<P>
   ``When choosing which brand of PC to buy, doing research is
important,'' Blachere said via e-mail. ``Read reviews. When you're
evaluating a potential system, find out what kind of components are
going into it. You'll have to look around to find good analyses of
these products, it's worth it not to get stuck with substandard
components.''
</P>
<P>
   The single most common application used on home computers
continues to be word processing, and this hasn't changed since
people first started bringing these machines into their dens.
</P>
<P>
   Many people use their PCs either to run a home business, or to
bring work home. These kinds of machines need to be a bit more
powerful than budget systems, because work done at home often
involves graphics. These machines also get used for home education,
and multimedia-based children's software also benefits from a more
powerful system.

 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QL; 
COMPUTER-BYTES-2NDTAKE &QL; 
UNDATED: powerful system.
</P>
<P>
   Processor _ Consider at least a 300-350 Mhz or faster Pentium II
or Celeron processor. The K6-2 and the Cyrix MII remain
alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Memory _ Sixty-four MB of memory is the minimum in this
category, largely because many home-business users tend to run
three or more applications at a time.
</P>
<P>
   It's not uncommon for a home worker to be using a word
processor, a spreadsheet, e-mail and a Web browser at the same
time. More memory makes this less painful.
</P>
<P>
   Hard drive _ Look for a system with 4 GB to 6 GB of hard drive
space. And again, the more the better, particularly if you do work
with graphics files, which can be large.
</P>
<P>
   Multimedia software also tends to take up quite a bit of space
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Modem _ A 56K fax modem remains the standard here, although
business users may want to consider a modem that will handle voice
and comes with voice-mail software.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommuters may want to consider ISDN or some other form of
higher-bandwidth connection, but that remains a luxury for now.
</P>
<P>
   CD-ROM _ As with the budget line, a 24X drive is the minimum.
DVD really doesn't come into play in this category yet _ there just
isn't the software out there to justify including it.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, this will change, particularly as more reference
works and databases are available on DVD. But for now, you can pass
without worry.
</P>
<P>
   Video _ For educational software and home business use, a
minimum of 4 MB of video memory is a must, particularly since a
larger monitor (see the next category) also is a good idea. With
the kinds of recommended processors in this category, you also
begin to see video cards that use Accelerated Graphics Port
connections. These are faster than PCI-based cards, and they tend
to have more memory as well.
</P>
<P>
   Audio _ The specifications here are about the same as for a
budget system, though positional audio becomes more important if
you use educational or multimedia software.
</P>
<P>
   Monitor _ A 15-inch monitor also is the minimum here, but a
17-inch model is highly desirable, particularly if you do tend to
work with more than one program open at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Slots and ports _ Expandability becomes more important for those
who use their computers for work. Look for systems with at least
two ISA and two PCI slots.
</P>
<P>
   Enthusiast/gamer
</P>
<P>
   John Romero _ co-author of the hits Doom and Quake and
co-founder of Ion Storm, a Dallas-based game company _ doesn't
believe gamers should compromise at all when it comes to high-end
PCs. Asked via e-mail for his recommended minimum specifications,
Romero came up with the following:
</P>
<P>
   (ital) ``OK, a hard-core gamer is going to want this stuff:
</P>
<P>
   Intel Pentium II MMX 450Mhz w/512K L2 cache
</P>
<P>
   ViewSonic 21 P815 USB Hub Monitor
</P>
<P>
   Creative Labs RIVA TNT 3D accelerator
</P>
<P>
   256Mb RAM
</P>
<P>
   9.1Gb Ultra-wide SCSI Hard drive, 7.5ms seek, 1mb buffer
</P>
<P>
   Adaptec 2940 Ultra-wide SCSI adapter
</P>
<P>
   Creative AWE64 value
</P>
<P>
   Logitech USB First Mouse+ wheel mouse
</P>
<P>
   Plextor Ultraplex 40max CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   Mad Catz Panther XL joystick
</P>
<P>
   Databurst ISDN external modem
</P>
<P>
   BSG Intensor chair or an Altec Lansing USB speaker system
</P>
<P>
   With some extra cash, I would get a Roland SoundCanvas SC-88 Pro
and an MPU-401 card.'' (endital)
</P>
<P>
   Romero estimated this would set you back about $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, most gamers don't have that kind of cash lying
around. So Romero was shown the following specs, of which he
approved:
</P>
<P>
   Processor _ Insist on a 400 or 450 Mhz Pentium II chip. Although
AMD just introduced a 400 Mhz version of its K6-2, not all games
support its 3-D-graphics enhancements.
</P>
<P>
   Memory _ Sixty-four megabytes would be considered the absolute
minimum. Most gamers aren't multitasking when they play games, so
64 will do just fine in most cases. But more is always better, RAM
is cheap and ... well, you get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Hard drive _ Games take up a huge amount of space. It's not
uncommon for a graphically intense title to grab up to 400 MB or
more off a hard drive. That's nearly half a gigabyte, and dedicated
gamers who buy many titles are going to quickly find themselves
constrained.
</P>
<P>
   That's why 6 GB to 8 GB should be the minimum. Romero mentioned
an SCSI-based hard drive, and while these are faster, they also are
very expensive. Drives that use the Ultra-DMA or EIDE standard are
just fine and are much cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Modem _ Romero also mentioned an ISDN modem, and gamers who play
multiplayer titles over the Internet _ or enthusiasts who can't
stand to wait for Web pages to load _ should consider ISDN if it's
available in your area.
</P>
<P>
   It won't come cheaply, though. ISDN modems generally are twice
as costly as traditional modems, and ISDN service from the phone
company is pricey, too. Southwestern Bell charges $56 a month, not
including installation fees. And most Internet service providers
also charge more for an ISDN account.
</P>
<P>
   But since cable modems are not available in most areas (Time
Warner Cable won't bring them to Houston until next spring) and
Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) service from the phone company is
even further off, ISDN remains a bandwidth junkie's best friend for
now.
</P>
<P>
   CD-ROM _ The gamer/enthusiast category is the only one in which
a DVD drive makes sense. There are already a handful of adventure
games available on DVD _ including the excellent Tex Murphy:
Overseer _ and more are on the way. However, be aware that many
DVD-ROM drives, while they are compatible with traditional CD-ROM
disks, aren't as fast as CD-only drives. That's changing as DVD
technology improves, but it will be a while before DVD-ROM drives
catch up. If you feel you need blinding CD-ROM speed, it might be
worth skipping DVD for now. A true enthusiast doesn't mind cracking
a PC's case to install something better.
</P>
<P>
   Video _ For gamers, a video card that supports either Silicon
Graphics' OpenGL standard, or 3Dfx's proprietary Glide technology,
is a must. The hottest games use these display schemes, as well as
Microsoft's DirectX.
</P>
<P>
   Additional video memory is important for games as well. Advanced
video cards can use extra memory to aid in rapidly generating
incredible effects, so look for cards with at least 8 MB of video
RAM.
</P>
<P>
   Audio _ Positional audio is a must for gamers. There are two
standards _ one from Aureal, A3D, and the other from Creative Labs,
Environmental Audio. More games currently support A3D, but Creative
Labs is gaining, largely on the basis of its popular SoundBlaster
line of cards.
</P>
<P>
   Game-players also will want a set of speakers with a subwoofer,
a large bass speaker that usually is placed on the floor. Or, for
the ultimate in audio immersion, consider Romero's suggestion for
the BSG Intensor, a chair with speakers built into the base and
back.
</P>
<P>
   Monitor _ Because gamers want their experiences to be immersive,
a bigger monitor puts you in the middle of the action. A 17-inch
monitor is the minimum. But with the cost of 19-inch monitors now
where 17-inch models were last year, they are worth considering.
</P>
<P>
   Slots and ports _ Gamers may want to add a special 3-D-only card
to their current graphics card, such as one that uses 3Dfx
Interactive's Voodoo or Voodoo2 chips. And enthusiasts may want to
add an SCSI card, or a video-capture card. For those reasons,
you'll want two ISA and three free PCI slots.
</P>
<P>
   If you are interested in home video editing, consider a PC that
has a IEEE 1394 connector _ also known as FireWire or ILink,
depending on the PC maker _ which can be used to connect consumer
electronics devices, including some video cameras. &QL;

   1. CHARLIZE THERON MEETS AN APE NAMED JOE In a two-year movie
career, rising star Charlize Theron, 23, has done double-takes with
Michael ``Kramer'' Richards, shared sex scenes with Al Pacino and
Keanu Reeves and acted opposite Kenneth Branagh for Woody Allen.
But her latest co-star is an 2,000-pound stuffed gorilla, the title
character in ``Mighty Joe Young.'' Theron talks about the new
movie, her struggle to overcome an isolated farm childhood in South
Africa and an injury that ended a promising dance career, her
experiences working for Woody Allen and why the former model hopes
never to have to model again. By Cindy Pearlman. 1,400 words +

<P>
   REMAKING OF 'PSYCHO' When Alfred Hitchcock's ``Psycho'' opened
in 1960, many people were too scared to take a shower for months.
When Gus Van Sant's remake opens Dec. 4, bathtub sales may
skyrocket once more. The two versions have one other thing in
common : the classic script written by Joe Stefano, which Van Sant
has chosen to use virtually intact, an unheard-of choice in a
remake. The 76-year-old Stefano talks about the new film, the old
film, how he and Hitchcock worked together, how he compares the
film's 1960 and 1998 stars and why, despite the huge success of
``Psycho,'' he and Hitchcock never worked together again. By Ian
Spelling. 1,400 words + photo. 3. FACE VALUE : 'PSYCHO'-SOMATIC In
this new cartoon feature, artist Vance Lehmkuhl offers an
intriguing take on Gus Van Sant's upcoming remake of Alfred
Hitchcock's 'Psycho,' with Hitchcock in a 'Psycho'-style shower,

the follow-up to 1995's ``Toy Story,'' the first full-length
computer-generated animated feature. The strength of the 'Bugs'
film, from Pixar Studios, is its elaborately drawn natural world,
through which the characters move. Although the computer is a tool
that shortens work and can increase effectiveness, animation is
still a labour-intensive process. ``To say that the computer
creates the animation is like saying the pen writes the novel,''
says director John Lasseter in this intriguing article on how to
make a great animated film. By Jay Carr. BPI. 1,600 words + photo.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the time an e-mail message reaches a resident of Grants,
N.M., an isolated town 75 miles west of Albuquerque, it has
traveled where few Internet transmissions have gone before.
</P>
<P>
   The town's primary Internet provider, Cibola Internet Services,
is linked to cyberspace by a satellite about 23,000 miles above the
Earth. At $1,700 a month, the service is not cheap, but the
alternative was even less appealing: Cibola's owner, Louis Uttaro,
said he had waited six months for the local phone company to
install a high-speed line with a monthly fee of $2,200.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of businesses, schools and Internet service providers
in remote areas have turned to satellite access to the Internet
because land lines are either unavailable or too expensive. Yet
service by satellite is still a small player in the Internet
marketplace, and industry analysts are skeptical that traditional
satellite connections such as that provided to Cibola will ever be
affordable enough to play a large role in the overall market.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, two California start-up companies say they have
engineered ways for more people to use the same satellite
simultaneously to gain access to the Internet and thus make the
technology more affordable and widespread.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of these companies is to offer less expensive
alternatives to a T1 line, the high-speed connection that most
Internet service providers and large corporations lease from local
telephone companies. A T1 line can handle 1.5 million bits, the
smallest units of information handled by a computer, a second.
</P>
<P>
   One company, Tachyon Inc., based in San Diego, plans to begin
testing its technology in Europe within a month, offering
high-speed access, equal in some cases to what is offered by a T1
line, for $400 a month. The second company, Aloha Networks Inc. in
San Francisco, plans to start a similar service, called SkyDSL,
within six months. Both systems cost several thousand dollars to
install and are aimed at businesses, not individual consumers, and
at buyers primarily outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``This works in Dubuque, in Mazatlan, in Dubai _ anywhere there
is not good cable and good service,'' John Koehler, president of
Tachyon, said. ``Our business is to provide communication links
from anywhere to the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The satellite companies do not plan to compete directly with
dial-up access, digital subscriber lines, cable modems or T1 lines,
which can cost $350 to $3,000 a month, depending on how far the
line must be stretched.
</P>
<P>
   ``Land lines aren't going to go away,'' said Nicholas
Negroponte, founder of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's
Media Lab and a member of Tachyon's board. ``If you want to move
bits from a specific point in Manhattan to a specific point in
London, there is no better way than to stretch a fiber line between
them.''
</P>
<P>
   But he sees Tachyon's solution as having great potential in
regions devoid of telephone and cable lines. ``I'm looking for ways
that rural communities and developing nations can get Internet
access long before they can get wired or even wireless terrestrial
structure,'' he said, ``and this is the only way of doing it for
the next four or five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are skeptical, though, that the technology will enjoy
widespread success. Abhi Chaki, a senior analyst with Jupiter
Communications, a market research firm in New York, projects that
by 2003 at most 2 percent of online households in the United States
will use satellite access to the Internet. And he says he does not
think that overseas markets will grow as much as the start-up
companies expect.
</P>
<P>
   Chaki said customers would not be very likely to switch from
land lines even if the satellite technology improved, in part
because they would perceive it as unreliable. ``If technology alone
were responsible for owning market share, you'd see Apple and
Betamax owning the markets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even the proponents of satellite access acknowledge that the
technology presents some serious challenges.
</P>
<P>
   The way satellite access works varies by company, but in
general, when an Internet user requests a connection to a Web page,
the signal first travels through a land line to a satellite dish,
typically on the roof of the company or the service provider. The
dish then transmits the signal at least 22,300 miles into space via
radio waves to a geostationary satellite _ one that is always in
the same position in relation to the equator, so that the ground
antenna never has to move.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite sends the request back to Earth, where it is
directed to the Internet. Once the information is retrieved, it is
sent by the same process back to the user. The whole process takes
only seconds.
</P>
<P>
   But one drawback of satellite-based Internet access is that the
data do not travel at the same speed in both directions. Data sent
from the satellite down to the user travel at speeds of 500
kilobits to 2 megabits a second, but the speed of information sent
from the user up to the satellite is typically not much greater
than that delivered through a standard 56 kilobit-per-second modem.
</P>
<P>
   Bigger satellites and more transmission power are required for a
faster trip up, and most businesses would find the cost
prohibitive, industry analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   The unequal speed coming and going, known as asynchronous
bandwidth, may be fine for individuals who typically send out, or
``upload'' to the network, only e-mail and Web page requests, and
it is common with some nonsatellite forms of Internet access. But
it is a problem for corporations that want to maintain Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   A second sticking point with satellite access is that the
distance the data must travel can cause delays.
</P>
<P>
   A third is that the geostationary satellites cost about $2
million a year to lease, yet can process only a limited number of
simultaneous data streams _ about 400 sources at a time, said Jim
Omura, president and chief executive of Aloha.
</P>
<P>
   Omura said Aloha's technology could increase the per-satellite
capacity to as many as 3,000 high-speed data streams, allowing
overhead costs to be spread among eight times as many users.
</P>
<P>
   He said the system would enable users to send out data at 64
kilobits a second, slightly faster than by a 56-kilobit modem. But
they could receive data at 500 kilobits a second, one-third the
speed of a T1 line. Omura said the company planned to charge $2,500
to install the system, plus monthly fees ranging from $500 to
$2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Users in some countries in Latin America, Aloha's first target,
now pay $2,000 a month for a dedicated land line carrying 64
kilobits per second both ways, Omura said. ``There is a growing gap
between the demand for Internet access and the ability of
terrestrial networks to meet those demands,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler, the Tachyon president, said his company had developed a
way to fit 3,000 to 4,000 users on a single satellite transponder.
The system will cost $3,500 to set up, and the monthly fees will
depend on how much bandwidth the customer needs. He said the
company planned to roll out the service in the United States and
Mexico on Jan. 2.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite access market already includes several major
players. One, Hughes Network Systems, based in Maryland, offers a
service called DirecPC to about 85,000 individual and corporate
users worldwide. Loral Orion, a division of Loral Space &AMP;
Communications, says it provides satellite access to 60 Internet
service providers, mostly in Europe. Intelligent Communications, a
Fremont, Calif., company, sells connection by satellite to 60
customers, including remote schools and Internet service providers.
Cibola, the service in New Mexico run by Uttaro, is one of its
customers.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, Intelligent Communications announced that it had
signed a deal to be acquired by Softnet Systems, a small company
based in Mountain View, Calif. Softnet will focus on delivering
high-speed access via satellite to small-town cable companies,
which will then sell it to their customers over cable modems.
</P>
<P>
   All these companies use geostationary satellites.
</P>
<P>
   An altogether different model is the much-publicized plan by
Teledesic, a company owned in part by Bill Gates, chairman of
Microsoft Corp., to develop a satellite-based system it calls
``Internet in the sky.'' In a $9 billion undertaking, Teledesic
plans to place 288 satellites into low orbit, about 850 miles above
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Because Teledesic's satellites would be closer to the Earth's
surface than geostationary satellites are, the round-trip time of
the data would be cut significantly. The catch is that users of
Teledesic's system will have to install antennae that can track
satellites that move through the sky rather than hang in one place.
The satellites have not been built or deployed, and the service
will not be operational until at least 2003, the company says.

RESURGENT IBM THRIVES BY MEETING TECHNOLOGY NEEDS FOR 
U.S. BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By David Einstein   
 1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a great ``Seinfeld'' scene in which George, after
fretting that he has become impotent, rediscovers his manhood and
shouts for all the world to hear, ``I'm back, baby!''
</P>
<P>
   That pretty well describes IBM these days.
</P>
<P>
   Given up for dead by many people just five years ago, Big Blue
has enjoyed under Lou Gerstner one of the great turnarounds in the
annals of U.S. business. With record sales and profits in 1997 and
a stock price that's shot through the roof, the Armonk, N.Y.,
company has regained its title as king of the computing world.
</P>
<P>
   Look anywhere in the industry and you'll find IBM's footprints.
Eight out of 10 mainframe computers sold carry the company's logo,
and an IBM AS/400, the most popular commercial business computer in
the world, is delivered to a new customer every 12 minutes of every
working day.
</P>
<P>
   IBM is among the leading makers of personal computers. It's one
of the top manufacturers of hard disk drives, which it develops and
produces in San Jose. And it makes microprocessors both for itself
and other computer-makers.
</P>
<P>
   It also is one of the top software companies in the world:
Nearly three-fourths of all the corporate data in the world is
managed by IBM's software, on IBM computers.
</P>
<P>
   As if that weren't enough, IBM is among the leading makers of
supercomputers _ its Deep Blue system routed world chess champion
Garry Kasparov without breaking a sweat.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, the company routinely leads the United States in
patents, which come out of eight research laboratories including
the Almaden Research Lab in San Jose. IBM scientists recently have
developed a hard disk drive capable of holding 25 gigabytes of
information, and have found a way to replace aluminum in computer
chips with copper, which conducts electricity 40 percent better.
</P>
<P>
   What has really enabled IBM to prosper, however, is its ability
to help businesses develop, implement and maintain computer systems
for the Internet age, including networks, intranets and electronic
commerce Web sites. IBM goes in and provides the equipment _ both
its own and other companies' _ and then services the system. Such
services now account for 25 percent of IBM's sales
</P>
<P>
   ``The kind of detail and deliverables they can get into are
astounding,'' said analyst Daniel Kunstler of J.P. Morgan. ``A lot
of companies can talk about creating a seamless global network, but
this is complicated stuff, and they can deliver it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bolstered by its ``Solutions for a small planet'' TV ads, IBM
has projected itself as the company others turn to for their
technology needs. It has been far more successful in promoting that
image than has Hewlett-Packard, its nearest competitor.
</P>
<P>
   OK: ``IBM has the largest service organization on the planet.
HP's not even close,'' said James Poyner, a respected analyst with
CIBC Oppenheimer. ``IBM has focused on pulling its various entities
together to provide a total bundle, and HP is just now pondering
these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Compaq, by acquiring Tandem and Digital Equipment, also signaled
its desire to be like IBM, but has a lot of catching up to do.
</P>
<P>
   The heady confidence in Armonk these days contrasts sharply with
five years ago, when IBM, an icon of American business since the
1920s, was on the ropes after losing money for three straight years
_ including $8.1 billion in 1993 alone.
</P>
<P>
   IBM found itself caught in a shift away from mainframe computers
to client-server systems that could be run with smaller,
less-expensive computers.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, IBM's PC business was in turmoil. After
pioneering PCs in the early 1980s, the company had watched
helplessly as a horde of IBM clones overwhelmed the market.
</P>
<P>
   IBM also was having trouble in the PC software business, where
its OS/2 operating system was in the process of being overwhelmed
by Microsoft Windows.
</P>
<P>
   By 1993, it was clear that the company was on the ropes, despite
restructurings that had cut the workforce from 400,000 to 300,000.
In April of that year, the board sent chief executive John Akers
packing, replacing him with Gerstner, who had been CEO of RJR
Nabisco, the big food conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   Gerstner started out with two strikes against him. He was the
first outsider ever to head up IBM, and he knew exactly zip about
technology.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, however, both of those apparent drawbacks
actually helped. Gerstner wasn't burdened by the traditional
blue-suit mentality that had paralyzed the company. And he cared
much more about selling products than what went inside them.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his grand vision for IBM, Gerstner said he didn't
have any. What he wanted to do was play to the company's strengths,
using its vast resources and global presence to forge a
product-services company second to none.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve that goal, Gerstner lopped off another 35,000 jobs
and began to cut back on research spending. At the same time, he
made it plain that pure research would take second place to
research that led directly to products.
</P>
<P>
   He also retooled the PC division, reducing a confusing product
line to a manageable number of models and doing a better job of
managing the retail channel.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Gerstner, despite being a technological
neophyte, recognized early on that IBM could use the Internet as a
vehicle for its global business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to focus on a strategy that unifies all parts of
IBM, and it's about using technology centered around the Web to
help customers transform their businesses and compete more
effectively,'' said John Thompson, a 27-year IBM veteran who heads
up its North American operations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, IBM returned to the black with a profit of $3 billion.
The earnings grew to $4.2 billion in 1995, $5.4 billion in 1997 and
$6.1 billion last year. Revenues also rose steadily, going from
$62.7 billion in 1993 to $78.5 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   IBM has continued on its roll this year. For the third quarter,
net income totaled $1.5 billion, and revenues were $20.1 billion.
Mainframe sales still shone and the PC business was good enough to
lift IBM to the No.3 spot in the U.S. market, behind Dell and
Compaq. Disk drive sales were strong.
</P>
<P>
   So were sales of Lotus Notes, the corporate groupware that IBM
got when it acquired software pioneer Lotus for $3.5 billion in
1995. At the time, critics said IBM paid too much, but last summer,
Lotus sold 3.4 million licenses for Notes, compared to 3.2 million
for Microsoft's Exchange, the only major competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it's hard to find anyone critical of IBM these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give credit to Gerstner and his management team
for taking what had been a giant mismanaged company not nimble
enough to respond to a rapidly changing industry, and turning it
into a focused company aggressively attacking every segment of the
industry,'' said Collins &AMP; Co. analyst Bruce Raabe.
</P>
<P>
   About the only knock on IBM is its heady stock price, which has
gone from $106 a share in June to a record $170 on Friday.
Oppenheimer's Poyner downgraded the stock to a ``hold'' because he
doesn't expect the price to go much above $160.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
COLUMN: A UPS delivers cheap insurance against power surges 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Either computers are getting more delicate or my readers live
especially highly charged lives.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year or so, the number of reports I've received from
readers about electrical damage to computers _ mostly through
lightning strikes to the home, but often just from voltage surges
or unknown causes _ has greatly increased. Honestly, a week seldom
goes by without learning of some newly fried computer.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, owning a good voltage surge protector was
almost considered overkill. But nowadays, the really prudent
computer user uses a device called a UPS _ uninterruptable power
supply _ to protect a computer.
</P>
<P>
   By now you may know what a UPS is, but both a joy and handicap
of this column is to be sentenced to teach first grade year after
year. The notion is to treat fairly complex technical problems
without forcing you to learn a word of technobabble. The handicap
of all that is the necessity to just hit the high points of a topic
and to explain things that many of you already know.
</P>
<P>
   So let's start by making sure you know just what a UPS is. Think
of it as a big battery, equipped with circuitry that turns the DC
power into the AC current that your computer needs. Add to that
bundle the ability of the gadget to sense when the regular AC goes
out and to quickly (we're talking milliseconds here, less time than
it takes you to blink) switch from house current to power from the
UPS.
</P>
<P>
   If that's all a UPS did (and it is about all that very early
units were capable of doing), then a UPS would still be a terrific
device. You'd never lose any data when the lights went out.
Instead, you'd have time to save the information you were working
on and to shut down the computer normally. A UPS was never intended
to be a long-term source of power for home computer users. If the
unit furnishes even 10 minutes of backup power, that's plenty of
time to shut down your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays there have been two big improvements in the kind of UPS
a home user is likely to buy. For one, these units now include
protection from the kind of power problems that are a lot less
dramatic _ and a lot more likely _ than a blackout. I'll give you a
few ``for instances,'' but there are so many types of power
glitches you'll either have to do research on your own or just take
my word _ there are a lot of unseen gremlins crawling around the
power grid. One type of problem, maybe the most common, is a
voltage sag. That's caused when a device that uses a lot of current
when it starts up _ think of a refrigerator compressor, for
instance _ pulls the voltage level down. Air conditioners do the
same thing. In an extreme case, the lights will lower, but often
you never even see these potentially harmful sags.
</P>
<P>
   But you probably have seen the results of a sag. A big one can
literally freeze your screen and _ over time _ reduce the life span
of your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on the opposite end of the spectrum, there's the spike.
That's a big jolt of electricity that suddenly zaps down the line.
One cause could be a lightning strike so far away that you never
hear the thunder from it. But your computer can feel it and be
destroyed or damaged.
</P>
<P>
   So the first big improvement is the built-in filtering you'll
find in almost any UPS you find at the computer store. The second
big improvement is the one that makes it possible for me to
recommend that you buy a UPS. Prices have dropped dramatically.
Even three or four years ago, you would pay $400 or so for a good
UPS. While that was probably still a sensible thing to do, the high
price tag made a UPS difficult to recommend.
</P>
<P>
   But nowadays, you can find a decent UPS for $100 and _ even for
a really fine unit _ you'll pay $200 or less.
</P>
<P>
   It's some of the best money you'll spend on computing. And,
unlike that fancy PC of yours, your UPS won't go out of date. You
may eventually have to replace the battery, or even buy a new unit,
but it's the cheapest insurance available for computing today.

Mac experts pick CDs suitable for giving 
By Charles Haddad  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ What's a good Macintosh CD to give as a gift? The
December issue of MacWorld has some ideas. This issue contains the
magazine's annual holiday roundup of the best reference and
entertainment software for the Mac. Among its recommendations is
the Complete MasterCook Suite, an interactive cookbook. Another
pick is Kid Pix Studio Deluxe, the venerable computer art program.
And, for young kids, MacWorld recommends ``Pajama Sam 2: Thunder
and Lightning Aren't So Frightening.'' This is a learning game from
Humongous Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   The holiday season is a hot time for new computer CDs. Companies
tend to issue lots of new titles to take advantage of the big
buying season. Not all, however, are games. Nor are all of them on
CDs. This year you'll be seeing more DVDs _ the trendy new digital
versatile disc format that holds much more data than a CD. Because
these discs can store more than twice the amount of data, it's
possible for them to do a better job with multimedia functions.
Among the new DVD titles are IBM's ``World Book Discoveries: The
Student's Multimedia Guide to World History.'' It features 5,400
images, seven hours of sound and more than 900 animations. The disc
lets you search, copy, export and print text and images. ``World
Book Discoveries'' is designed as a homework aide for kids. It's
available only for PCs running either Windows 95 or Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   In the game department, Microprose is releasing another ``Top
Gun'' title, ``Hornet's Nest.'' This is a combat flight simulator.
You play a maverick young navy pilot flying an F/A-18 fighter jet.
There are 30 missions and three overall campaigns. Play against the
computer or others online. ``Hornet's Nest'' is available only for
PCs running Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   Online
</P>
<P>
   Parents, are you looking for a kid site not driven by one of the
big entertainment companies? Then check out Kids On-Line America,
or the KOLA Network. It's commercial but directed toward kids,
education and teachers. The site's content is screened carefully.
You'll find all kinds of stuff here, including chat rooms, bulletin
boards and e-mail features. The site is divided into six
communities: junior, kids, teen, senior, parents and teachers.
You'll find KOLA Network at http://www.kola.net.

<HEADLINE>
AGE OF ELECTRONIC BOOK MAY FINALLY BE AT HAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ETHAN BRONNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At Virginia Commonwealth University, sociology students use a
textbook that exists only online. It sends them to related Web
sites, has recorded lectures they can rewind and offers discussion
areas that supplement and enliven their classroom discussions.
</P>
<P>
   At Kent State University in Ohio next spring, a few dozen
students will receive devices called electronic books, which look
like latter-day Etch-a-Sketches and will be loaded with course
texts.
</P>
<P>
   And in Texas, the state Board of Education is planning a pilot
program to distribute electronic books and laptop computers next
fall to thousands of high school students.
</P>
<P>
   With futurologists having mistakenly predicted the end of the
printed page for several decades now, no one is preparing a eulogy
for the traditional book. Television did not doom radio, video did
not kill film, and electronic publishing will not likely end print.
</P>
<P>
   But with two electronic book devices on the market and an
exponential increase in reference and scholarly material available
online, many experts say that the shift from page to screen, once a
Jetson-like fantasy, is now approaching reality.
</P>
<P>
   And there are those, like Jeff Rothenberg, a senior computer
scientist at the Rand Corp., who say they can see the day when
books printed on paper will be viewed ``more as objets d'art than
things we use all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Raymond, an editor at McGraw-Hill, said: ``I am a book
person and I never believed I would want to give up the books I
carry around with me. But I'm starting to think of myself more as a
content provider. I look at my 11-year-old son's school backpack,
which I worry is ruining his spine, and I can see advantages to
electronic books. We know we are standing on the edge of a
precipice.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion that a shift is imminent comes because of several
parallel developments.
</P>
<P>
   First, electronic book technology is advancing rapidly, with
better screen resolution and longer battery life. The cost of such
devices is dropping; two kinds of electronic books are on the
market for $300 to $500 each, and another, for $1,000 to $1,500, is
due early next year. All of them allow downloading of whole books
from the Internet into their memories, permitting students to carry
many books in one lightweight device. The devices allow word
searches and have built-in dictionary functions.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the amount of material available for downloading is now
enormous.
</P>
<P>
   And third, a generation is coming of age for whom absorbing
digital information seems easy and natural. Even if not many young
people seem ready to curl up with a hand-held screen for reading a
novel, the idea of reading textbook or reference material from
screens is increasingly common.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, anything electronic was exotic,'' said Paul
Saffo, a director at the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park,
Calif. ``Today, computers are an integral part of higher education.
You can see where electronic books would fit into the shape of
academic life. I see this as a key time for this technology,
probably still one of interesting failures but ones we can really
learn from.''
</P>
<P>
   One important change in the last few years is the growing use of
the Internet for reference works. Texts for physicians, lawyers and
other professionals are being put on line, where they can be
updated with greater ease and at lower cost than printed texts.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a growing number of textbooks have online
supplements for graphics, pictures and, increasingly, video and
audio supplements. Some think it will not be long before the entire
books are transferred into digital format.
</P>
<P>
   John Wiley &AMP; Sons, which publishes texts for professionals in
technical fields, says that in the coming months two of its
standard reference works _ the Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical
Technology, and the Wiley Encyclopedia of Electrical and
Electronics Engineering _ will be available online.
</P>
<P>
   Like most other reference works on the Internet, those books
will be accessible for a fee. That is also the case with an
Internet publishing site called Online Originals, which publishes
original works of fiction that can be bought online for $7 each.
</P>
<P>
   Some publishers are placing texts on the Web for free, relying
on contributions or advertising for revenue. The Gutenberg Project,
for example, has placed thousands of classics online.
</P>
<P>
   Emedicine.com offers, at no charge, a new encyclopedia for
emergency-room physicians that was written by 400 doctors. Members
of the military in far-flung places and a missionary in Haiti are
among those who have told the organizers, Dr. Scott Plantz, a
research director at the Chicago Medical School, and Dr. Jonathan
Adler of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, that they found
the site helpful. The site has been financed primarily by Plantz
and Adler, who hope that advertising by drug companies will
ultimately allow the site to pay for itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have up to 400,000 hits a day,'' Plantz said. ``A big
advantage is that we will be able to update it constantly and embed
in it new pictures and even video clips. Our book is two-and-a-half
times bigger than any textbook in the field ever published. And a
typical textbook is $200.''
</P>
<P>
   The market for educational texts was more than $5.5 billion last
year, and the Internet has only expanded that market, which has
grown more than 8 percent so far in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   And if textbooks really do move further, from the printed page
into the digital realm, the potential for profits is likely to be
greater still, because that change could reduce the need for
warehouses, trucks, returns and, even more significant, the
used-book market.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Nelson, a sociology professor at Virginia Commonwealth who
wrote an online textbook that he now uses, said he found much more
``active learning'' from his online book than from customary books.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have two classes right now, and they are both using the Web
intensively,'' Nelson said. ``One class has 300 students, and the
other has 40. In the large class, the students each write 12 essays
and pose questions to each other on the Web. They interact with
each other every week, and they can do it on their own time. The
level of their activity is inconceivable in a normal class. I see a
big difference from before this technology was introduced.''
</P>
<P>
   At Kent State, Roger Fidler, director of the information design
laboratory, said he planned to test two kinds of electronic books
in classes next spring and fall. The hand-held devices, which weigh
3 to 5 pounds, can store 10 to 15 books downloaded from the
Internet. Fidler plans to give half of each class the new devices
and the other half the usual textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, Fidler says, a company is developing a kind of ATM for
train stations, which will distribute digital magazines. A customer
could download the magazine onto a cassette and then install it on
a hand-held device for reading. That could become a model for
magazine and newspaper distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Ira Fuchs, vice president for computing and information
technology at Princeton University, said the key for the future of
electronic books will be increased screen clarity and lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say they love bookstores, but they are buying from
Amazon.com,'' he said. ``Give them convenience, and the next thing
you know you will be telling your grandchild about this thing you
once had called a book.''

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 Comparison Shopping For an ISP  
 By David Einstein   
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Question: &LR;  I need a new Internet service provider. I want
unlimited monthly use. There seem to be hundreds of choices
available. Do you have any suggestions on how to find a good ISP?
And are there any comparisons I could look at?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  You're right, there are hundreds of ISPs to choose
from in California _ and more than 5,000 throughout the country.
Finding one that suits your needs won't be difficult, though,
because most ISPs offer unlimited service for a monthly fee of
about $20. (Some go as low as $8 a month if you prepay for a year.)
For information about ISPs with local access numbers for your area,
go to either www.boardwatch.com or www.isps.com. Both Web sites
have extensive lists of ISPs and the services they offer.
</P>
<P>
   As for comparisons, rating ISPs is a little tough because there
are so many of them. You might check out an article by my
colleague, Jon Swartz, in the October 27 special Telecommunications
Section in which he spotlighted some of the top performers. You can
find the article at sfgate.com, The Chronicle's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   When choosing an ISP, the most important considerations should
be reliability, service and technical support. Above all, you
shouldn't have to suffer busy signals or other connection problems.
</P>
<P>
   Grammatically Correct
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a Packard Bell PC which came with Microsoft Works.
Although it has a spell checker, we badly need a grammar checker
for my teenage daughter. Is there a patch or add-on I can download
without upgrading to Word?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not that I know of. However, you can get Word, complete with
grammar checker, as part of Microsoft's Works Suite 99. This
under-$100 package is one of the best bargains around. Besides
Word, it includes Works version 4.5, the Encarta Encyclopedia 99,
Money 99, a mapping program and a greeting card program.
</P>
<P>
   But if you want my advice, forget the software and get your
daughter a good English grammar workbook. That way, she might learn
how to use the language so she wouldn't have to depend on a
computer. An electronic grammar checker can clean up her work and
possibly even improve her grades, but in the long run, she won't
know any more about English than she does now.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for spell checkers, which have given us a
generation of kids who don't know how to spell and don't care
because they can always ask the computer to bail them out.
</P>
<P>
   Little Black Book
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there some way to print out the address book in the
Netscape e-mail program? It would be handy to have a copy while
traveling.
</P>
<P>
   A: You can't send the address book information directly to the
printer, but with the latest upgrade of Netscape Communicator,
version 4.5, you can save it and print it out using another program
like Word.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how: With your address book open, select the name of the
directory _ such as Personal Address Book _ that you want to save.
Then choose Export from the File menu. Give the file a name and
save it. You can choose a format that's compatible with Netscape
Communicator or one that works with a word processor or
spreadsheet.
</P>
<P>
   No More Cookies
</P>
<P>
   Q: A few months ago, you provided information on how to disable
cookies when using Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer. Is
there also a way to do it in the newest 4.0 version of America
Online?
</P>
<P>
   A: There is indeed. But before I get to that, let's define
cookies for readers who aren't familiar with them. A cookie is a
tiny file sent to your browser by a Web site. It's used to store
information about you for use when you return to the site. A cookie

</P>
<P>
   To change the way AOL 4.0 deals with cookies, choose Preferences
from the My AOL menu, click on WWW, and then click the Security

Finally, click on Settings. This brings up the Security Settings
box. Scroll down till you come to the part about cookies. You'll
see three options: Always accept cookies, Prompt before accepting

On-line auction can offer thrills of real-life bidding 
By Douglas Kalajian  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ If you're near a personal computer,
you're within arm's reach of America's biggest garage sale.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people who just don't have enough stuff and don't
want to leave home to get more have made on-line auction site eBay
the Internet's latest why-didn't-I-think-of-that phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   A computer programmer whose girlfriend wanted to find other Pez
dispenser collectors started eBay three years ago, and it has grown
from 340,000 registered users to 1.27 million during the past 10
months.
</P>
<P>
   The California-based company's stock, offered for the first time
in September, zoomed from $18 to $218 in two months, and founder
Pierre Omidyar's stake approached $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The attraction is powerful but simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``One man's junk is another man's treasure,'' said Jennifer Chu,
eBay's associate public relations manager.
</P>
<P>
   With more than a million items for sale, eBay is the World Wide
Web's version of a vast, tin-roofed flea market, at
http://www.ebay.com. Sellers, all independent of eBay, post nearly
100,000 new items daily _ new to eBay, but mostly more thrift store
than Bloomingdale's.
</P>
<P>
   Just a sampling of what you could buy (or try to) on eBay: an
old dental extractor ($205), a burp gun that shoots pingpong balls
($13), a rotary valve tuba ($510), a 1988 Ferrari ($62,800).
</P>
<P>
   Plus, of course, loads of Beanie Babies, Furbys and other hot
toys.
</P>
<P>
   Dollar figures are bids, not prices, and they're followed by the
time remaining until the auction ends. It may be days, hours or
less.
</P>
<P>
   If your heart pounds when you discover that someone is offering
a bronze bust of Liberace like the one Mom loved, it may pound even
harder when you realize you have 12 minutes to decide whether you
really want it in your living room.
</P>
<P>
   Feverish pace attracts bidders
</P>
<P>
   Even if you do, you might lose out to someone who wants it more.
The fever of the bidding is one of eBay's main attractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the thrill of it,'' Chu said. ``It's so exciting to bid
and so frustrating when you don't get an item.''
</P>
<P>
   Add the thrill of the unknown. On-line auctions are gauzy
bazaars where bidders can't touch the merchandise and may find the
seller identified only by nickname.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainties were underscored recently when a Lake Worth
man became the only person barred for life from doing business on
the Internet. He settled a Federal Trade Commission complaint that
he failed to deliver more than $20,000 in computers that he offered
on eBay and another on-line auction, Up4Sale.
</P>
<P>
   While eBay says risks for buyers are small, it acknowledges the
potential for fraud, warns users to beware and says it makes no
guarantees about goods or the people who hawk them. The service's
users cover a wide range.
</P>
<P>
   ``All walks of life, all income levels,'' Chu said. ``It's not
only a place to buy and sell but to meet other people with similar
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Success has brought increased competition: Yahoo Auctions
(www.yahoo.com) went on line in September, joining an auction site
of competing search engine Excite (www.excite.com), as well as
dozens of others.
</P>
<P>
   But eBay has responded by buying out the 50,000-user Up4Sale
(www.up4sale.com) and agreeing to pay America Online $12 million
for a three-year agreement that will make it easier for AOL members
to buy and sell through eBay.
</P>
<P>
   One of eBay's primary distinctions is its person-to-person
nature. Most previous on-line auctions were run by companies
offering products, mostly electronics, directly to buyers. Most of
eBay's sellers are individual entrepreneurs looking to make a few
dollars on things they'd otherwise donate to charity, or looking to
make a lot of dollars on their hobbies.
</P>
<P>
   ``People start businesses this way,'' Chu said.
</P>
<P>
   Some have found a new way of doing business. Margaret and John
Cantrell have had an antique/collectibles shop on Dixie Highway in
West Palm Beach for seven years, but they haven't opened the doors
much since they started offering their wares on eBay last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son's on the computer all day, my husband's taking
pictures, and I'm packing things,'' Margaret Cantrell said. ``We've
sold more on eBay in the last month than we have in the past year
at the store.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cantrells have found eBay perfect for the small items they
specialize in: jewelry, pottery, vintage clothing. They've found
eBay buyers in Sweden, Italy and Monaco, among other places.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Renault is also impressed with the international reach eBay
has given him from Boynton Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sold an American watch to a guy in Taiwan,'' Renault said.
``And I just sold a one-armed, one-legged doll to a guy in
Australia for $860. That's pretty cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Renault, who runs Robert Renault Estate Liquidators, is a
computer fan who found eBay about a year ago while searching other
on-line auction sites. He now lists about 10 items at a time and
sells about 80 percent of what he lists.
</P>
<P>
   And even though Renault's a regular at local antique fairs, eBay
has become a dependable source of collectibles for his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought a slot machine, a Tiffany bowl, dolls for my kids,''
he said. ``You can find anything in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Renault shoots pictures of everything he offers on eBay with a
digital camera and posts them with the descriptions. He says
everyone he's bought from has described flaws and other important
details properly.
</P>
<P>
   Renault's only complaint is mild: Access to eBay has slowed as
users increased.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot more people have been browsing recently since eBay
started advertising,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Browsing eBay is free. So is bidding. All that's needed to make
an offer is to register, which requires an e-mail address that can
be verified by return message. Registered users can post any item
by paying a fee ranging from 25 cents for anything under $10, to $2
for anything $50 and up.
</P>
<P>
   The seller has a choice of auction length: three, five or seven
days. As bids come in, the posted dollar figure rises and the
seller is updated regularly by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   High bid binding
</P>
<P>
   Sellers are encouraged to start with their lowest acceptable
price, but it's not mandatory and some find that an artificially
low listing draws more bidders.
</P>
<P>
   The final, high bid is binding on the buyer, although some
occasionally back out. The seller is required to pay eBay a second
fee of up to 5 percent of the high bid (but only 1.5 percent on
bids over $1,000) _ even if the seller decides he can't part with
Uncle Jerry's toupee after all.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few other rules, conditions and variations (such as
Dutch auctions for multiple-but-identical items), but it never gets
complicated enough to require a degree in either business or
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the profusion of obscure items, eBay boasts a high
success rate. ``A conservative estimate is that 70 percent of the
items listed result in a sale,'' Chu said.
</P>
<P>
   Competition for some items is so intense that several companies
offer software that can program a bidder's computer to dial in with
an offer moments before an auction's close. Such software isn't
condoned by eBay, but it's also not outlawed as long as the bidder
follows all the rules, Chu said.
</P>
<P>
   But the company is sensitive to the possibility of bid
manipulation and forbids practices such as shilling, in which a
seller enlists a friend to help drive up the price with phantom
bids. It has a team that investigates complaints and has revoked
the registration of users who break the rules, Chu said.
</P>
<P>
   The company also investigates complaints about merchandise and
sellers and revokes privileges when warranted, Chu said.
</P>
<P>
   In papers filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission at
the time of the stock offering, eBay noted that its success depends
on sellers describing items accurately and delivering them
reliably. But eBay takes no responsibility for either.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC filings acknowledged that the company has received
complaints from sellers and buyers. They also noted that a state
attorney general's office had received complaints that the company
did not provide adequate warning that it doesn't guarantee
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it believed its disclosures were adequate. The
Florida Attorney General's Office has taken no action against any
on-line auction company, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Although bidders don't get a guarantee, they do get plenty of
advice on how to protect themselves. And eBay offers several
features to help, including feedback ratings and notices about
sellers based on past buyers' experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Feedback feature effective
</P>
<P>
   The feedback feature is effective, said local user Renault.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants negative feedback,'' he said. ``If a dealer sees
negative feedback, he won't buy from you again.''
</P>
<P>
   Buyers are encouraged to e-mail the seller with questions before
bidding and to ask for a phone number. Escrow agents will act as
intermediaries for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think most people are good, but there are always a few bad
apples,'' Chu said.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the company lists protection tips from the National
Consumers League's Internet Fraud Watch, Chu said.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Grant, fraud watch director, said on-line auctions account
for 65 percent of the more than 5,500 complaints the nonprofit
organization has received about Internet businesses this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the different categories of Internet fraud we track,
on-line auctions are number one,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The volume of complaints is small compared to the number of
users and is spread across various auction sites. Grant warned of
several common pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to know who you're dealing with and where they are
physically,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you're sure, it may be difficult to pursue a complaint.
</P>
<P>
   While individual sellers actually may be operating businesses,
that can be hard to prove long-distance. Grant also warned that a
seller can plant positive feedback.
</P>
<P>
   But many regular bidders and sellers get to know each other,
particularly those with special collecting interests.
</P>
<P>
   There are eBay chat areas for people who collect just about
anything, and eBay recently began offering users free Web pages to
tell more about themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are millions of people who have had happy on-line
transactions,'' Grant said. ``I do think you have to be cautious.
It's nothing to hurtle into blindly.''

THE WEBPAD: A WIRELESS INTERNET APPLIANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from
magic,'' the science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke observed.
Inevitably, wags have added corollaries like, ``Any sufficiently
advanced magic is indistinguishable from technology,'' and my
favorite, ``Any sufficiently advanced technology or magic is
indistinguishable from a rigged demo.''
</P>
<P>
   The mother lode of rigged demos is the annual Comdex computer
trade show, which was held last week in Las Vegas, itself a city
based on illusion, artificial enhancements and suspension of
rational belief. Computer and software companies come from around
the world to show off their new products, even if the products are
not quite ready for market and even if the product is simply a
rigged demonstration intended to show what the developer hopes to
create if only the engineers and programmers can get the thing to
work eventually, within budget.
</P>
<P>
   At Comdex in Las Vegas, one should always peek behind the
curtain when someone is doing a demo. (And one should never take a
card in blackjack when the dealer's up card is a 4, 5 or 6, but
that's another story.)
</P>
<P>
   Imagine my surprise, then, when the Cyrix Corp. demonstrated a
wonderful prototype product called the Webpad, and there were no
curtains or hidden wires anywhere to be found.
</P>
<P>
   The Webpad, which is expected to be available sometime next
summer, is a battery-powered, wireless computer about the size of
an Etch-a-Sketch toy, or, for those who never had an Etch-a-Sketch,
about the size of a very thick magazine. It uses radio waves to
browse the World Wide Web, send and receive e-mail and perform
other Internet tasks, all channeled wirelessly through a receiver
attached to a regular personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   This three-pound Internet appliance is to Web browsing what a
cordless phone is to telephony, a portable device that lets people
wander through the house or office without being tethered by a
wire.
</P>
<P>
   One of the knocks against electronic media _ the computer
versions of books, newspapers, magazines, letters, and so on,
enhanced with interactivity, animation and perhaps sound and video
_ is that because they are viewed on a computer screen, they are
not as portable as paper.
</P>
<P>
   Some people, for example, are reading this column while seated
at the breakfast table. It would be awkward, not to mention rude,
to have a personal computer at the table. But the Webpad, with its
10.4-inch active matrix screen, is small and light enough to find a
home between the corn flakes and the coffee, yet big enough to show
a full screen of information.
</P>
<P>
   It can serve up stock quotes and financial research from the
easy chair in the den, football statistics from the sofa in front
of the television set and perhaps even a bedtime story from the
bedroom. It allows people to read the morning electronic newspaper
even while sitting in the smallest room of the house.
</P>
<P>
   It does so by maintaining a radio-frequency link with a
conventional computer elsewhere in the house through a base station
attached to a special card that plugs into the desktop computer.
The main computer can be 300 to 500 feet away, depending on the
architecture of the house. Unlike infrared wireless computer
connections, the radio waves, at a frequency of 2.4 gigahertz,
penetrate walls and floors easily. (So the Federal Communications
Commission will certainly want to test the Webpad to make sure that
it does not interfere with the neighbor's electronic devices.
Imagine the fun if every time you click on Yahoo, your neighbor's
garage door opens.)
</P>
<P>
   The Webpad is useful primarily because it can be left around
doing nothing and picked up when it is needed. If the price can be
driven down quickly through mass production _ the folks at Cyrix
anticipate that the first units will cost around $500 _ one can
envision having two or more Webpads scattered around the house.
</P>
<P>
   Each pad, like a cordless phone, will have to be dropped into a
recharging base periodically to keep the batteries from dying.
</P>
<P>
   The recharging base is likely to have Universal Serial Bus
connection ports for a keyboard and a mouse. When the user strays
from the base station, mouse functions are replaced by tapping on
the touch screen with a stylus, and the user can tap out simple
e-mail messages and responses by pecking characters on a virtual
keyboard on screen. The pad itself has built-in speakers and a
microphone, which suggests that voice recognition and transcription
are possibilities someday.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Webpad is useful only when its host computer
somewhere else in the house has a live connection to the Internet.
And the faster that connection is, the less waiting the Webpad user
will endure. That is why the Webpad makes the most sense for people
who have a high-speed, always-on connection to the Internet, of the
sort just beginning to be offered by cable companies (cable modems)
and phone companies (DSL, or digital subscriber lines).
</P>
<P>
   If the personal computer is ever to achieve equal status in the
home with the television, the telephone and other household
appliances, it will have to have a persistent connection. We have
come to expect a dial tone as soon as we lift the telephone
receiver, and we will eventually come to expect a Web tone when we
pick up a computer.
</P>
<P>
   The Webpad will be a dud if the owner has to dial up America
Online, fight off busy signals and tie up the family phone around
the clock just to have a portable Web browser. Certainly the
Internet will not reach its full potential until it is available
instantly at the click of a mouse (or, in the case of the Webpad,
the flick of the stylus.)
</P>
<P>
   So the Webpad is the sort of device, I suspect, that Internet
Service Providers may someday offer free, or at low cost, as an
enticement to get their customers to sign up for persistent
high-speed access.
</P>
<P>
   At Comdex last week, MCI Worldcom announced that it would begin
offering DSL service before the end of the year in New York,
Boston, Washington and other major cities and that America Online
and Earthlink would begin trials of the new DSL service by the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   There are several different types of DSL service. The most
common one is ADSL, or asymmetrical, which means that bits coming
from the Internet to the user (downloading) travel at a higher
speed than bits going from the user to the Internet (uploading).
Depending on what level of service the consumer chooses, and how
far away the telephone company's central office is, the upstream
speeds range from 64 Kbps (about 64 kilobits per second, or 64,000
bits per second) to 384 Kbps, and downstream from 384 Kbps to 768
Kbps.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for consumer DSL service will be set by the phone
companies and the ISP's, but MCI Worldcom executives said they
expected the monthly cost to be $40 to $60. The advantages are much
faster connection speeds (as much as 25 times the downloading speed
of a standard 28.8 modem), a persistent connection (the Internet is
always ``on'') and the elimination of the need for a second phone
line (one teen-ager can talk on the phone while another surfs the
Web).
</P>
<P>
   With such a connection, the Webpad would become very handy.
</P>
<P>
   Cyrix, which makes microprocessors, is unlikely to make the
Webpad itself. Rather, it will license the basic design to computer
makers.
</P>
<P>
   One can envision Webpads that include a telephone, allowing
users to make and receive voice calls while browsing the Internet
cordlessly.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps Microsoft will start making Webpads that incorporate
its newly announced Clear Type screen technology, another prototype
technology that Microsoft asserts will someday make text on
computer screens as legible as text on paper. Microsoft's chairman,
William H. Gates, said Cleartype technology would be incorporated
into Windows 98 and other Microsoft products beginning next year.
</P>
<P>
   If Microsoft's demo can be translated into a working product,
devices like the Webpad will be useful not only as wireless Web
browsers, but also as portable electronic books.

 Tech firms help e-businesses get started  
 By Carol Emert   
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Starr Report was released in September, Palo Alto
resident Ron Jones got the bright idea of building a Web site to
sell marshmallows printed with images of political figures.
</P>
<P>
   Jones hired an artist to draw caricatures of Bill Clinton,
Monica Lewinsky and Ken Starr. He figured out how to stamp the
drawings on marshmallows with food coloring. And he found a Web
hosting company, City Online Communications of Oakland, to help him
get his site up and running.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' e-business, Mellow Out Co. (www.politicalroasters.com),
began selling marshmallows for $1 a pop on October 1. The company
already has recovered its startup costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm delighted with the site and want to add more products to
it,'' said Jones. ``Some people have been asking for the whole
Judiciary Committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones is among thousands of entrepreneurs who have turned to a
portal, an internet service provider or other Web hosting service
to handle the technological side of their e-businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who put up their own sites, but things like
handling credit card charges and configuring the server properly
can get pretty complex pretty quickly,'' said Jim Balderston, an
analyst with Zona Research in Redwood City.
</P>
<P>
   New e-commerce startups can lose customers if their business
takes off and they lack the technological prowess to handle a lot
of orders, cautioned Bill Burnham, an analyst with Credit Suisse
First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially for small businesses, if you don't have extensive
information-technology experience, outsourcing makes a lot more
sense,'' Balderston said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no shortage of Web hosting companies, which range from
big national names such as Yahoo to little local ISPs like City
Online.
</P>
<P>
   These companies offer a range of services for a variety of fees.
Their most important task is to ``host'' client sites on their
World Wide Web servers so that small companies don't have to buy
and maintain these expensive and complicated machines themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The hosts also provide encryption technology so credit card
information can be sent over the Web relatively safely.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them also assist new businesses in setting up merchant
accounts with banks, something all business must have to accept
credit card payments.
</P>
<P>
   Other services that are commonly offered include:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Site Design.  &LR; Some hosting companies will provide graphic
design services for customers for an additional charge.
</P>
<P>
   Others simply provide page templates that clients can organize
and personalize with colors, images and text of their own choosing.
The templates are designed to be simple enough for even
techno-dummies to create a passable site.
</P>
<P>
   Merchants who create their own sites need to have either a
scanner at their disposal or another way to create and upload
digital images.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Domain name registration.  &LR; There is a $70 base registration
fee charged by Network Solutions, which has been in charge of
regulating regulates all domain names. Some hosting companies will
register a name at no extra cost while others charge a service fee.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Search engine registration.  &LR; Most visitors to small,
specialized e-commerce sites find the site by keying a search term,
such as ``marshmallow'' or ``Linda Tripp,'' into a search engine.
The search engine then lists sites that include that word.
</P>
<P>
   Some hosting services will register search words for each site
they host with anywhere from a handful to hundreds of search
engines and directories. Others leave registering up to their
clients, who may or may not choose to do it. (Many search terms are
picked up by search engines without registering.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Traffic analysis reports.  &LR; Most hosts analyze information
from their servers to track visitors to their client sites. The
sites then can use these reports to find out, for example, which
search engines most visitors used to find them and even which
search terms generated the most visits.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Bull, who runs a site that sells educational games for
children with learning disabilities, cautions that designing a site
can be more complicated than would-be merchants might expect, even
when using a very user-friendly hosting service.
</P>
<P>
   Bull's site (www.smartstuffgoodideas.com), which he designed
himself, is hosted by Yahoo, which says even design novices can set
up a store in under an hour using its templates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put up one product on one page and you have all of your
(design elements) prepared in advance, it would take an hour,''
said Bull, a film and video director who runs Smart Stuff &AMP; Good
Ideas out of his Menlo Park garage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find I spend hours tweaking it to make it nice,'' Bull
added.

AOL CHIEF SEES IMPROVEMENTS WITH ACQUISITION OF NETSCAPE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MATT BEER   
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ While Wall Street analysts chewed over America
Online's $4.2 billion acquisition of Internet pioneer Netscape
Communications Corp., computer users were asking what was in it for
them.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Examiner posed some user questions to AOL
chief executive Steve Case in a telephone interview Tuesday from
his headquarters in Dulles, Va.:
</P>
<P>
   Question: Will AOL cost more?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: No.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is AOL going to invest in system improvements so I can get
on-line faster?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. We've invested over a billion dollars over the last year
in system improvements, and that continues. We've made tremendous
progress over the last year and a half in improving the quality of
access. The busy signals that we had a real problem with a year and
a half to two years ago have largely subsided. There are still
certain cities at certain times of the day where there may be
problems, but it's not a significant national problem.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How else will the merger affect AOL right now?
</P>
<P>
   A: The merger won't be complete for three or four months. Then
over time, we'll incrementally add functionality to AOL where it
makes sense. But for now, the AOL service, the AOL experience, will
stay pretty much the same. (The merger) is more about building the
Netscape-Netcenter brand to reach another audience. It really has
less to do with the AOL service itself.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will Netscape keep being updated?
</P>
<P>
   A: Absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will Netscape continue to be free?
</P>
<P>
   A: Absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will the Netscape browser continue to let me browse the whole
Web or just AOL-affiliated sites?
</P>
<P>
   A: Everything, absolutely. We recognize that there's a lot of
momentum for what Netscape is doing. Tens of millions of people use
the software. Nine million in the last year have registered as
users of the Netscape-Netcenter site.
</P>
<P>
   Our strategy, when we do acquisitions _ we acquired Compuserve a
year ago _ is to try to allow them to run as an independent entity
and to provide support wherever it's helpful.
</P>
<P>
   Take the ICQ (Web-chatting software) audience, for example,
which we acquired six months ago. A lot of people said, ``Oh,
what's going to happen here? AOL is going to acquire this, start
charging for it and start putting ads on.'' Six months later, the
audience there has doubled, and they're as happy as can be with the
enhancements we've added to the service.
</P>
<P>
   All of the fears have been for naught. The same will be true
here.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will my AOL Web browser change?
</P>
<P>
   A: No.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is AOL going to eventually wind up being totally on the Web?
</P>
<P>
   A: We will use whatever technologies seem appropriate to create
the best possible experience for consumers. We're doing more and
more things on the Web, but there's still benefits to using some of
the capabilities we've got uniquely on AOL.

`KILLER APP' APT TO BE NOTHING REALLY SPECIAL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c.1998 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Nowadays I see many computer ads mention ``killer
applications'' and ``killer utilities.'' What exactly are they?
</P>
<P>
   A. Time for a quick lesson in computer industry jargon and hype.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, ``killer app'' meant an application that validated a
particular category or product. The original killer app was
considered to be Lotus 1-2-3, because it made the IBM-compatible
personal computer a must-have item in business.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, the World Wide Web has been called the killer app
for the Internet, making it essential. And the Internet itself has
been called a killer app, validating the concept of computer
networks.
</P>
<P>
   Some predicted killer apps don't make it. Desktop
videoconferencing was once called a killer app, but its widespread
use has not materialized.
</P>
<P>
   And some killer apps come and go. Remember when CD-ROM-based
multimedia was all the rage? While CD-ROMs are now the primary way
software is distributed, the Internet instead has become the
primary way to deliver information that includes text, images and
sound.
</P>
<P>
   Today, ``killer app'' is largely misused. Any well-done computer
program is dubbed a killer app. But real ones come along only
occasionally, and they cause a fundamental shift in the way people
use a technology.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I recently bought a new printer and installed the software
that came with it. That was easy _ I just put the CD into the
CD-ROM drive and it started automatically (I have Windows 98). But
now, the printer maker has sent me a floppy disk with an updated
driver. When I put it in the computer, it doesn't start
automatically like the CD did. And I don't really understand the
limited directions on the floppy's label. How do I get this driver
in my computer?
</P>
<P>
   A. Put the floppy in the drive on the computer, then open the My
Computer icon on your desktop, followed by the floppy drive icon.
If you see a program there called SETUP.EXE, double- or
single-click on it _ depending on how you have Windows 98 set up _
to launch it.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't see that file, then go back to My Computer and open
the Printers folder. You'll see the current driver there _
right-click on it, and choose Properties. Click on the details tab,
and one of the buttons on that screen will be New Driver ... Click
that button.
</P>
<P>
   A box called Select Device will pop up. Click the Have Disk
button and the system will find the floppy and begin the
installation process.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Time to replace the old computer, and I have enough cash to
get a really nice one. I am tempted to get one of these new
flat-panel monitors, but I'd like to hear the pros and cons.
</P>
<P>
   A. One of the biggest pros is the crisp, bright, easy-to-look-at
screen. Flat-panel monitors, which are like the quality,
active-matrix screens found on notebook computers, don't suffer
from flicker as do traditional monitors. They also take up less
space because they are so thin.
</P>
<P>
   But there are negatives, the first being cost. The cheapest ones
run at least twice what a traditional monitor of the same size
would cost.
</P>
<P>
   They wash out as you view them from the side, so you usually
must be directly in line with the screen for a good look. If you
buy one of the new digital flat-panel screens, you'll also have to
get a special video card to work with it.
</P>
<P>
   They also are not as flexible when it comes to resolution.
Usually they have a ``native'' resolution _ say, 800-by-600 pixels
_ and if you go below that the screen image is shrunken or
distorted.

SLOOOOOW DOWN. YOUR COMPUTER CERTAINLY WILL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DR EMILIO BOMBAY  
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I connect to the Web at 32,000 (bits per
second), but as I load pages, the status bar tells me I am
receiving stuff at 260 bytes per second. Well, how come? Why do
they get away with that first lie? Is there truth in advertising?
</P>
<P>
   _ The Wrong Truth
</P>
<P>
   DEAR WRONG: Well, obviously you don't understand the underlying
tenet of advertising, namely that if ad executives told the
complete truth about a product, their forked tongues would snap off
and fall wriggling to the floor. Remember, their job is to get you
to give money to their clients, and they're certainly not going to
let a silly thing like honesty threaten the lease payments on their
Beemers.
</P>
<P>
   My advice? Read the fine print. The lawyers make them put that
in to keep torch-toting mobs of villagers at bay. Can't download at
56K? Sorry, not our fault. It says so right on the box. Now go away
or we dump the boiling oil.
</P>
<P>
   You may have a 56K modem, but I'd be surprised if you connected
at anything faster than 32. There are too many things out there
conspiring to slow down connection speed, from bad phone lines to
bad Internet providers. And even if you get a fairly fast
connection, that doesn't mean the page or file you're downloading
is going to come in fast. It all depends on how much traffic the
remote site has, how fast their servers are, how good their link to
the Net is and how much wood a woodchuck could comfortably chuck.
</P>
<P>
   Want to download that ``Star Wars'' prequel clip? Good luck. Too
many other four-eyed loners with no lives are trying to beat you to
it. When Internet Explorer first debuted, it took one guy I know a
full day to download it. Get used to the wait. It's part of what
makes surfing so much fun: You have plenty of time to read.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Why would Apple hire Jeff Goldblum to sell
iMacs? He's so weird.
</P>
<P>
   _ Puzzled
</P>
<P>
   DEAR PUZZ: It's sad isn't it? It's like he's so ashamed and
embarrassed by what's he's doing that he can't even look the camera
in the eye. I wonder why he didn't have the same problem in ``The
Lost World.''
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: When things don't go right inside my computer,
I like to format the hard drive and start from scratch. Will this
shorten the life of my computer?
</P>
<P>
   _ Deja Vu All Over Again
</P>
<P>
   DEAR VU: It'll probably lengthen it by keeping you from picking
up the nearest large, blunt object instead. I reformat every time
Windows explodes on me _ I think I'm up in the hundreds _ and have
never had a problem. Well, other than having to use Windows.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Hallo!!!!!! I am a very big fan of ``Calcutta
(Taxi, Taxi, Taxi'') so I wondred if you could send me it on
(E-mail address deleted). If you didn't understood my wrote, so is
it because I from Norway.
</P>
<P>
   _ Your Biggest Fan
</P>
<P>
   DEAR BIGGEST: This was sort of funny when it first started, but
it's gotten out of hand. Even if I really was the rock band of the
same name, you people in Scandinavia should stop expecting
handouts. And stop sending me all that fan mail. I'm not them!
Well, unless you're a beautiful, single Scandinavian woman, of
course.

 &HT;    More of same from still rockin' Stones
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the question is whether this live album is necessary, then
the answer _ one being volunteered by many critics _ is a
resounding ``No.'' It's the umpteenth live recording from the
Stones, whose music is also available on some 50 other releases.
But if the question is, does ``No Security'' satisfyingly document
the band's just-ended tour, the answer is an equally resounding
``Yes.'' It captures the ability of fiftysomething Mick Jagger &AMP;
Co. to still raise a sonic ruckus and delight fans with strong
versions of ``Sister Morphine,'' ``Gimme Shelter,'' ``The Last
Time'' and other tunes from a deep catalog. As the just-announced
plans for an arena tour starting in January indicate, the Stones
won't go away. So let 'em roll.
</P>

   ``No Security''

<P>
   Rolling Stones. Virgin. 14 tracks.

 &HT;    Metallica scores with cover songs
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   An album such as ``Garage Inc.,'' in which reigning hard rock
act Metallica pays tribute to the bands that influenced its early
career, could easily be a throwaway. Like those rarity-laden boxed
sets that show up just in time for Christmas, this two-CD package
of ``cover'' songs _ the sort of tunes Metallica played before it
had written many of its own _ is geared to the true fan's collector
mentality. But it's much more than a novelty, it's actually a
Metallica tradition: the latest installment in a series that
includes 1987's ``Garage Days Re-revisited'' album plus various
B-sides to vinyl and CD releases. (Disc 1 is newly recorded; Disc 2
features material from 1984 to '96).
</P>
<P>
   As expected, there's an abundance of death-tripping intensity
and ghoulish shenanigans (such as Budgie's ``Crash Course in Brain
Surgery'' and Danzig's pathological ``Last Caress'') as well as
homages to eternal underground faves Motorhead, the Misfits and
Mercyful Fate (bands whose names all, curiously, start with the
letter M). It's all delivered, as it should be, with a gleaming
ferocity and bit of a smirk, as if the songs were really the source
for good-natured horseplay. Yet there are all kinds of surprises.
Bob Seger's ``Turn the Page'' and Blue Oyster Cult's ``Astronomy''
provide glimpses of introspection and ``Tuesday's Gone,'' a
signature for Lynyrd Skynyrd, comes complete with a harmonica solo
by John Popper, the frontman for hippie jam faves Blues Traveler.
Stranger meetings could be imagined, but not anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Garage Inc.''
</P>
<P>
   Metallica. Elektra. 27 tracks (two CDs).
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A crash course in heavy metal fandom.

ANALYSIS: SEPARATION OVER SYNERGY AT AOL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If America Online followed all the advice it was getting for how
to take advantage of its pending purchase of Netscape
Communications Corp., it would merge its AOL.com Web site with
Netscape's Netcenter Web site, it would use Netscape's browser on
its online service, and every time someone used the Netscape
Communicator program to check for messages, it would chirp,
``You've got mail.''
</P>
<P>
   But America Online defiantly puts separation above synergy and
would rather own multiple, if somewhat competitive, offerings than
create one big homogeneous master brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at things like a media company rather than as a
technology company,'' said Barry Schuler, president of America
Online's main programming division. ``Why does Time Warner have
both HBO and Cinemax? Because the audience segments in attitude and
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   And thus rather than blur the lines between the America Online
services and those of Netscape, Schuler said his company would more
crisply delineate the Netscape brand to appeal to more
technologically sophisticated users.
</P>
<P>
   This is a very different approach than that taken by most online
companies. Microsoft Corp., for example, recently tied together all
of its far-flung Internet activities under the MSN brand. But
America Online's driving force these days is its president, Robert
Pittman, who as one of the creators of MTV concocted a second music
channel, VH1, to appeal to an older audience, and then started
Nickelodeon to appeal to children.
</P>
<P>
   Pittman is fond of saying that while Pepsi may beat Coca-Cola in
taste tests, ``In America, brands win.'' As a result, America
Online has maintained the separate identities of its other
acquisitions: Compuserve, another online service, and Mirabilis,
the provider of the ICQ chat service, popular among technologically
hip youth worldwide. Users of these services see nary a mention of
the America Online name.
</P>
<P>
   Some think that all this talk of market segments leads to a
confusing overlap of products.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the consumer would be better served if they put all
their wood behind a single brand, be it Netscape, ICQ or AOL,''
said George Bell, chief executive of Excite, which bought the
Webcrawler search service from America Online and kept it as a
separate portal, a strategy Bell now thinks was flawed. ``It's
really hard to manage not only the multiple businesses you buy but
the multiple consumer propositions you keep alive through all those
brands.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, America Online argues it must make changes gingerly,
because many of its core users find the whole cyberworld baffling
and cannot tell the difference between a browser, an online service
and a hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   This confusion has been a factor in America Online's phenomenal
success. Once a user puts one of its ubiquitous disks into a
computer, it automatically installs the software, sets up the modem
to dial into the network and handles everything from e-mail to
Internet browsing to finding sports scores in one seamless
environment. America Online says it will not add any features from
Netscape that will make the service more confusing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't need Netscape to revitalize the AOL brand,'' said
Paul Noglows, an analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, the California
investment bank. ``It is continuing to grow and gain momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   Netscape, of course, is most known for pushing the technology in
just one piece of that puzzle: browsing. Netscape's browser
software, known as Navigator, is the window through which users can
view pages on the World Wide Web. But Netscape does not offer a
connection to the Internet; that has to be arranged either through
an Internet service provider or a corporate network.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, until recently, did it provide any information or content.
The company's Web site, called Netcenter, was an attempt earlier
this year to build a new advertising-supported business when it was
forced by competition from Microsoft to start giving Navigator away
free. Navigator, a Web guide or ``portal'' service modeled after
Yahoo, lures its audience because it is the first screen that many
Navigator users see when they start to surf.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape's browser and its Web site do bring to America Online
several audience groups that are underrepresented in its main
service. For example, America Online is very strong among
teen-agers, who use it to chat among their friends, and among older
adults, who like its simplicity. But Netscape has much greater
penetration among college students, who often are given its browser
as part of their school networks.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, America Online wants to create a new online service
based on the Netscape browser that it hopes it would especially
appeal to recent college graduates who need to arrange for online
access after losing their accounts at school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think these people are never going to get excited about the
AOL brand, but they do have an affinity for the Netscape brand,''
Schuler said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this risks offending some of the independent Internet
service providers who distribute Netscape's browser. But then
again, their only alternative is Internet Explorer by Microsoft,
which runs its own MSN Internet access service.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, America Online says it will continue to use Microsoft
Internet Explorer itself in its main online service. The reason is
that in return, Microsoft includes a copy of America Online's
software in every copy of the Windows software package, saving the
company hundreds of millions of dollars a year in mailing out
disks. That deal does not give Microsoft much more than bragging
rights, though, because the version of Internet Explorer that
America Online uses is so well integrated into its own software
that most users do not know when it is running. Moreover, it does
not contain any of the links to Microsoft's MSN online service that
are in other copies of Internet Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, America Online does not plan to merge the Netcenter
site with its own huge AOL.com site. Netcenter's main audience is
one of America Online's weakest groups: people who use the Internet
during the day at their offices. The company had hoped that daytime
users would use its Internet site, AOL.com, as a portal instead of
Yahoo. But AOL.com does not appeal to that audience because it is
mainly a friendly and colorful site that was designed to be used by
people on America Online's proprietary services as their first step
onto the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Netcenter, by contrast, has a more businesslike tone. And
Netscape has been developing a series of services that combine its
software and Web site to appeal to professionals. For example, it
will let you move a copy of your file of personal contacts from
Netscape's Communicator program, onto its Web site, so that you can
look up a phone number from the road (assuming you have the right
password). America Online does plan to link Netscape gingerly to
its other brands. It will place a button to download Navigator on
the software program ICQ chat service users must run in order to
send and receive instant messages.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 10 million active users of the ICQ chat
service. America Online is working on ways to put more features on
that program that will drive ICQ users to advertising-supported Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   There may be some link as well with Compuserve, when its new
software is introduced at the end of the year. That will lower
costs by running Compuserve's service using America Online's vast
computer network behind the scenes and pave the way for a marketing
blitz that emphasizes Compuserve's traditional appeal as a more
sober, professional, less entertainment-oriented service than
America Online itself. Now the company has to decide whether to
risk a potential delay in the product introduction to replace
Internet Explorer with Netscape Navigator in the Compuserve
software.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect any chipper voices talking about the arrival of
e-mail.

<P>
   ``The Mask of Zorro'' (PG-13)
</P>
<P>
   Old-fashioned in the nicest way, this throwback to the serials
of yore reinvigorates the legend of the righteous bandito. Anthony
Hopkins plays the original, Z-slashing swashbuckler, whose identity
is discovered and family destroyed by the evil Don Rafael (Stuart
Wilson). Flash forward a couple of decades, and Hopkins is grooming
petty thief Alejandro (Antonio Banderas) to wear the mask as the
new Zorro, and avenge himself on the Don. It's all fun, hokey
stuff, propelled with humor, action, great stunts, and the
chemistry between Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones, who proves to
be more than just a pretty face. Grade: B +

MOTION-CAPTURE ANIMATION A BREAKTHROUGH IN CARTOON PRODUCITON 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Computer animation is pushing into new territory on the wings of
an unlikely fleet of cartoon airplanes _ characters in a series for
preschoolers that began Nov. 2 on the Learning Channel on cable
television.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional animators who create two-dimensional characters like
those in the shows ``South Park'' and ``Rugrats'' now routinely use
computer graphics to replicate the hundreds of frames needed to
make a character move. But the creators of the new show, ``Jay Jay
the Jet Plane,'' are using an entirely different method called
real-time performance animation in which the facial expressions of
as many as seven actors are detected by sensors and fed into
computers, giving expressive vitality to animated characters.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called digital motion-capture technique has never been
used for an entire 24-minute show, according to Bruce Johnson, a
former Hanna-Barbera executive who started Porchlight Entertainment
in Los Angeles to create children's programming. ``Jay Jay'' is a
joint venture of Porchlight, Chris Walker's Modern Cartoons and the
character's creator, David Michel, a Dallas executive who hopes to
convert the airplane stories he made up for his son into a
licensing franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Digital motion-capture technology has existed for a decade, but
its use has been limited to a single virtual character for video or
CD-ROM games and for special effects in feature films, such as the
figures who dangled from ropes in ``Titanic.'' Animated films like
``Antz'' from Dreamworks SKG and ``Toy Story'' from Walt Disney get
their three-dimensional quality through the costly, time-consuming
process of adding realistic lighting and backgrounds by computer.
</P>
<P>
   Motion-capture makes animation more affordable by speeding
production and lowering costs; it also improves production values
by giving characters the humanistic qualities animators strive for,
said Joan Collins Carey, a visual-effects producer who is
assembling a documentary on computer animation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The direction Chris is going is leading the rest of the
industry,'' she said. ``This is very good for studios that want to
kick out content.''
</P>
<P>
   To orchestrate all the ``Jay Jay'' elements _ seven character
performers, two walk-on live-action characters, miniature sets and
seven model airplanes _ meant spending $1 million during the last
year converting a missile plant in Oxnard, Calif., into a studio.
Proprietary software that synchronizes 35 Compaq Alpha NT computers
does the job.
</P>
<P>
   Like a situation comedy, ``Jay Jay'' uses several cameras that
shift the audience's point of view. ``We're shooting 11 minutes of
production animation a day,'' said Douglas Rask, the show's
producer. ``It's a volume unheard of in animation.''
</P>
<P>
   Modern Cartoons falls short of the Holy Grail of animation: the
simulation of human motion naturally. ``Jay Jay'' characters rely
only on actors' faces; their bodies are airplanes. But Walker
thinks the show has achieved a breakthrough. ``We've industrialized
cartoon production with motion-capture,'' he said. ``I've been
working toward this for 12 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The cable network, owned by Discovery Communications and
distributed to 70 million homes, has licensed 26 episodes for each
of three years. The partners hope to turn a profit by selling
foreign broadcast rights and merchandising.
</P>
<P>
   It's a path well trod by characters like Barney and Teletubbies,
and ``Jay Jay'' has an advantage they lacked. Even before his first
regular series, the character was well known to the preschool set.
In the last four years, his creator, Michel, has sold 250,000 ``Jay
Jay'' videos that featured some of the same production techniques,
mostly using direct-response advertising on two children's cable
channels, Viacom's Nickelodeon and Time Warner's Cartoon Network.
</P>
<P>
   The Learning Channel ``is not a destination point for
preschoolers,'' Michel said. ``They've made a big commitment in
giving us a time slot.''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Hope you're having a Happy New Year.
 &HT;    No, it's not January. And Christmas is still weeks away. It is
Advent -- the beginning of the Christian year.
 &HT;    Many religions begin a new year at some time other than the
calendar new year of January 1. Although Christians have used that
calendar for centuries, it was not originally theirs -- it was a
secular calendar. Early Christians marked time differently than the
surrounding culture. Their year, the church year, began four weeks
before Christmas with Advent.
 &HT;    Most of us anticipate a new year with hope that the coming
twelve months will bring joy and prosperity. Yet, no matter our
hopes, what is to come remains unknown to us -- events will unfold
according to circumstances largely outside our control.
 &HT;    The Christian year also starts with expectation of what is to
come. Unlike the beginning of the secular year, however, Advent
proclaims what is coming can be known -- the coming of the Lord.
 &HT;    When I was a teenager attending a non-liturgical church, we
ignored Advent. Sometimes, my mother -- following an old family
tradition -- would buy an Advent calendar. After a few days, we
children would usually forget to open the windows until Christmas
eve. Advent -- the word itself means ``coming'' -- came and went in
the midst of holiday stress.
 &HT;    At that time, ``the coming of the Lord'' scared me. My church
taught that God's coming would be a time of judgment accompanied by
fire and destruction -- the end of the world. Although the pastor
believed the Lord would return soon (and seemed to think this a
good thing), I fervently prayed God would wait. I was sure I wanted
to avoid the end of the world. The coming of the Lord was not
something I anticipated with joy.
 &HT;    When I later joined the Episcopal church I was shocked -- and
dismayed -- to discover that the Christian year began with ``the
coming of the Lord.'' In spite of such wariness, Advent became my
favorite church season. It felt pleasingly counter-cultural to
celebrate a new year in the last weeks of everyone else's old one.
 &HT;    I came to appreciate the regularity of the church year in
contrast to the unpredictability of the secular year. More than
anything else, however, I learned to hope for the coming of the
Lord.
 &HT;    The Lord's advent should not inspire dread and fear. Rather,
when the church proclaims God's coming it proclaims hope and love.
Advent is about God's presence -- a God who comes into our lives as
as we face the vicissitudes of that other calendar.
 &HT;    When the strains of ``O come, O come, Emmanuel'' sound, we are
reminded that Emmanuel means ``God with us.'' Not God against us.
Not God judging us. God with us.
 &HT;    The Christian year -- indeed the Christian message -- centers on
the belief that God became enfleshed and dwelt with human beings.
God is not a distant, cold entity. Rather, God has joined us on our
journey; God has been with us and is with us.
 &HT;    Advent teaches that God came, does come, and will come. But it
also reminds that God comes in unpredictable ways.
 &HT;    At the time Jesus -- whom Christians believe the enfleshment of
God -- was born, those awaiting God thought God would come to judge
the earth, punish the wicked and establish a kingdom of justice.
Instead of this flashy entrance, God chose to be born as a child --
love and justice suckling its mother's breast.
 &HT;    God comes, yes. But God comes where least expected and often
unnoticed. This is not a God of glory, but, as Martin Luther, the
founder of Protestantism said, as a ``God hidden'' in humanity.
 &HT;    Beginning last January, I could have never predicted the changes
a single year brought in my life. But Advent prepared me by
reminding that -- in the midst of unpredictability -- the Lord will
come. Over the last year, I have seen God come many times -- as my
infant daughter grew and took her first steps, as my husband and I
learned to parent her, as my family cried when my father died, as
my sister and I held my mother's hands in the hospital after her
heart attack.
 &HT;    In these things and a thousand others, God came as companion and
comforter, teacher and mentor, guide and fellow-pilgrim along the
way. God came hidden in human suffering; swaddled in human joy.
 &HT;    Advent is not simply a time to prepare for Christmas -- a kind
of religious warm-up to the big event. Rather, Advent grounds the
new year on a solid foundation: whatever comes, God comes.
 &HT;    Not a bad way to begin.

REPORT ON E-COMMERCE INSISTS ON SELF-REGULATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To many Americans, the name Ira Magaziner is
synonymous with the ill-fated Clinton health care plan. But the
presidential adviser's more lasting legacy may prove to be the
administration's laissez-faire policy on Internet commerce: no
taxes, no government regulations.
</P>
<P>
   As Magaziner prepares to take leave of the White House,
President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore are scheduled to
release with great fanfare on Monday a long-awaited report by
Magaziner's interagency working group in electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The report _ the foundation of the administration's new Internet
commerce policy _ argues for stronger consumer protection and
privacy rights, but like Magaziner's 1997 ``Framework for
Electronic Commerce,'' it clings to the insistence that these be
achieved through self-regulation by industries rather than dictated
by the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Self-regulation in the digital age will require the private
sector to engage in much greater collective action to set and
enforce rules than was characteristic of the Industrial Age,'' the
report states.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees with that theme, particularly as it relates
to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   One of Magaziner's most vocal critics, Marc Rotenberg of the
Electronic Privacy Information Center, is among those who say that
``self-regulation has been a lot of smoke and mirrors.''
</P>
<P>
   Rotenberg insists that laws are needed to protect consumer
interests and personal data in the young and often free-for-all
atmosphere of cyberspace. Without such laws, he warns, the United
States will open itself to a trade war with Europe, where
self-regulation has been declared incompatible with laws
guaranteeing strong privacy protections for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The European law, which took effect in October, prohibits any
company that does business in the European Union from transmitting
personal data to any nation that does not guarantee comparable
privacy protections.
</P>
<P>
   Magaziner concedes, ``If self-regulation is not working at the
end of the year, then I would advocate that government do more.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he adds: ``I would point out that just
passing laws is still not protecting privacy. You still have to put
in place an enforcement mechanism and demonstrate that you can
enforce the law. So I think it might be fairer for critics to say
that no country has found a way to do this adequately.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Farber, a professor of computer science at the University
of Pennsylvania and a board member of the Internet civil liberties
group the Electronic Frontier Foundation, says the fact that the
United States has won a reprieve from the European Union while both
sides search for mutually acceptable privacy protections is a
credit to Magaziner.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the differences over privacy ``a real nightmare,''
Farber said: ``I think what he has done has kept us from falling
off an edge of a cliff. October came and we are still doing
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond consumer issues, the report tries to head off moves by
the Federal Communications Commission to regulate high-speed
Internet access in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are rumblings about the FCC wanting to regulate advanced
services,'' Magaziner said. ``We want to make it clear that we
think this would be a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also calls for a series of programs intended to
spread the Internet to developing countries quickly, using
low-orbit satellite links in areas that lack telephone service; to
help small businesses use the Internet, and to update the
government's statistical and economic models to help better measure
the economic impact of information technology industries.
</P>
<P>
   A final report on the administration's _ and Magaziner's _
headway on cyberspace issues, the document details treaties signed
and laws passed in the last 18 months to keep the Internet tax free
and unregulated and to encourage electronic commerce with new
digital copyright and security protections.
</P>
<P>
   Those successes, said Harris Miller, president of the
Information Technology Association of America, a trade
organization, show that Magaziner proved to be ``a pivotal leader
at a pivotal time.''
</P>
<P>
   His most important contribution, Miller said, was ``the idea
that the Internet and electronic commerce are not going to be like
traditional industries in the sense that they need to be heavily
regulated from birth.''
</P>
<P>
   While even an outspoken critic like Rotenberg gives Magaziner
``a lot of credit for his energy, his smarts, and his ability to
create a coherent vision for the administration,'' he added, ``At
the end of the day, it can be fairly asked whether the
administration's policy was based on self-regulation or on
promoting business interests.''
</P>
<P>
   The paradox is that such criticism is the antithesis of
widespread criticism of the plan for a heavily regulated national
health care system that Magaziner and Hillary Rodham Clinton
proposed during the president's first term.
</P>
<P>
   Where the Internet policy is seen as laissez-faire, the health
care plan was criticized as government meddling. And shaping
Internet policy has been a comparatively low-key effort, consensus
driven and largely devoid of the partisan politics that Magaziner
largely blames for the health care plan's demise.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was also an effort that began almost accidentally, without
any preconceived political notions or agendas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, when health care failed, I actually offered to
resign,'' Magaziner said in an interview over the weekend. ``The
president said no. He suggested that I do something in a different
area _ not in health care because Hillary and I had both become
radioactive on that subject.''
</P>
<P>
   So in 1995, Magaziner recalled, he and the late commerce
secretary, Ron Brown, and Mickey Kantor began holding hearings
around the country to develop an economic development strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really was almost no electronic commerce on the Internet
then,'' Magaziner said. ``But it became very clear to me that if we
set the right environment, the Internet and electronic commerce
were going to explode.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``When I presented that, to be honest, I think a
number of people didn't understand. But the president did.''
</P>
<P>
   Magaziner then set out to formulate a new policy for the
administration and to sell those goals domestically and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, there was suspicion of the United States and the
fact that the Internet started here and that somehow we were trying
to use this whole policy to further the American agenda around the
world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he said, the ``principles we began espousing spread
around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   On an issue even more contentious than electronic commerce,
Magaziner recently wrapped up an agreement for turning over
administration of the Internet's addressing system, which has
historically been managed by government contractors, to a private,
nonprofit corporation _ a big step in Internet self- governance.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Magaziner says he feels his role is played out. ``We
accomplished more than the goals we set out for,'' he said. ``I
think it is a good time to return to private life.''
</P>
<P>
   After wrapping up his White House duties in the next few days,
he will join his wife and three children in Rhode Island and decide
what the future holds for him professionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he did a very good job,'' said Farber of the
Electronic Frontier Foundation. ``He was very visible to the
Internet community. He tried very hard to get into the culture. He
got online. He traveled. He felt he had to meet these people.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Farber said: ``He probably decided the whole
Internet community is wacko. And it probably is.''

FIRST BOSTON POLISHES ITS IMAGE 
 HELP FOR SPEEDERS 
WEB ADDRESS FOR SALE

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Credit Suisse First Boston's technology banking team _ led by
the uber-banker Frank Quattrone, who moved from Deutsche Bank in
July _ is turning the luxurious Phoenician resort in Arizona into a
playland for clients at its annual conference starting Monday. And
for the first time, reporters are invited to this most exclusive of
parties, which will include four-wheeling in the Sonoran desert and
a dinner show starring the comedian Dana Carvey.
</P>
<P>
   Why the sudden new openness? Credit Suisse First Boston could be
trying to improve its image.
</P>
<P>
   The company ranks seventh in advising on technology mergers and
acquisitions in the five months since Quattrone was promised
millions in exchange for bringing in more technology business.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Suisse First Boston has been involved in six transactions
worth $2.14 billion, according to Securities Data Co.
</P>
<P>
   That pales in comparison with activity for Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, where Quattrone got his start, which advised on 16 deals
valued at $23.8 billion, and Bear Stearns Co., which advised on
five deals for $14.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Suisse was absent last week from one of the technology
sector's highest-profile deals _ the acquisition of Netscape
Communications Corp. by America Online.
</P>
<P>
   And when Ascend Communications bought Stratus Computer Inc.
earlier this year, it was Salomon Smith Barney representing Ascend,
not the longtime relationship bankers in Quattrone's group.
</P>
<P>
   So what does Credit Suisse have to say?
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the company said it was indeed trying to
market itself to a wider audience. ``Frank Quattrone recognizes the
value of cultivating good media,'' she said.

   Get a Speeding Ticket, Head for the Internet
</P>
<P>
   What do you get when you cross an Internet marketing guy with a
lawyer? In one case, www.speedingticket.net, a new Web service for
people nabbed for speeding and other traffic violations while away
from home territory.
</P>
<P>
   The intent of the site _ not to be confused with
www.speedingticket.com, which sells a book on how to beat a
speeding ticket _ is to match traffic violators with local lawyers
who can represent them in court in the counties where they got
their tickets. And with the holiday travel season soon to be in
full swing, the prospects are pretty good that there will be plenty
of tickets doled out to people just passing through town. Already,
the site is getting 11,000 hits a day on some weekends.
</P>
<P>
   John White, an Internet entrepreneur in Charlotte, N.C., said he
came up with the idea after a friend who is a lawyer told him how
much effort he had been putting into trying to get the names of
traffic violators from out of town in the hopes of getting their
business. Eventually, White says, he plans to offer an online
traffic school and listings of bail bondsmen nationwide. Pretty
soon, traffic violators will not even have to leave their homes to
get themselves out of hot water.
</P>
<P>
   White charges lawyers $99 each to list their firms on
speedingticket.net, and so far he has 1,500 of the nation's 3,100
counties covered. His goal is to list three or four lawyers in each
county, so people can shop around.
</P>
<P>
   For the ticketed, the service is free _ but the legal services
are not. Depending on the area of the country and the complexity of
the case, a traffic violator can typically hire a lawyer in a
speeding case for $100 to $300. White says his biggest customers so
far have been truck drivers and traveling salespeople, who cannot
afford to see their insurance premiums go up.

   More Fancy Prices for a Domain Name
</P>
<P>
   And you thought the days of Internet squatting were over? Kevin
Sinclair, who lives in a Silicon Valley suburb, is the lucky owner
of www.computer.com, presumably one the most valuable domain names
on the World Wide Web. And now he wants to sell it for at least
$500,000. So far the highest bidder has offered $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   His associate representing him in the sale, Gary Kremen, insists
that Sinclair is not a speculator but that he planned to start an
online computer store when he acquired the name in 1994. He quickly
realized he did not have a shot in such a competitive market, even
with the right address. So he left the working world to stay home
with his children.
</P>
<P>
   While Sinclair, who also has the phone number 1-800-COMPUTER, is
willing to accept cash, he would prefer stock in an Internet
start-up. And Kremen may be just the right guy to help him make a
deal: Kremen was involved in the negotiations between Digital
Equipment Corp. and Jack Marshall, who until earlier this year
owned the address www.altavista.com. Digital, which owns the Alta
Vista search engine, paid Marshall $3 million to give the name up,
reportedly the largest amount ever paid for a domain name.

   12 Nude Pictures Start a Copyright Extravaganza
</P>
<P>
   As copyright battles go, this one just does not seem to have an
end in sight. Just a few weeks after a federal judge ruled that the
Internet Entertainment Group could display 12 nude photos of Laura
Schlessinger, the radio talk show celebrity whose program offers
advice to both the lovesick and the just plain sick, on its Web
site, the company finds itself caught up in a nasty fight to
prevent other Web sites from doing the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in Seattle, has sent a cease-and-desist
warning to more than 50 Web site owners to get them to stop
publishing the photos, which the company bought from Bill Ballance,
Schlessinger's lover 20 years ago. And last week, it filed a
lawsuit against one of them, the After Hours Production Co. of
Houston, calling the whole lot Internet pirates.
</P>
<P>
   It all started earlier this fall when Schlessinger, known to her
fans as Laura, sued Internet Entertainment in an ill-fated attempt
to prevent it from displaying the photos. On Nov. 2, a federal
judge in Los Angeles ruled in favor of the company, saying that as
the legal copyright holder, it had the right to publish the photos,
which were apparently taken while Schlessinger and Ballance were
married to other people. Since then, more than 100,000 people have
viewed the photos online.
</P>
<P>
   With this latest action, the saga of the dirty dozen is, once
again, about to test the limits of the nation's copyright laws as
they apply to the Internet. Internet Entertainment Group contends
that the other Web site owners could be fined as much as $100,000
and handed jail terms of as long as five years.
</P>
<P>
   As for Schlessinger, it's irrelevant to her how many Web sites
pick up the photos at this point or who wins the court battles.
``What difference does it make?'' said Keven Bellows, vice
president and general manager of ``The Laura Schlessinger Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The cow is already out of the barn,'' she said.

Grolier encyclopedia serves its purpose well 
By Jack Warner  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The 1999 Grolier multimedia encyclopedia has its share
of problems, but on the whole it is a very useful reference work.
</P>
<P>
   The interface, while easy enough to use, also allows the user to
easily miss some features. I've grown used to encyclopedias that
use little icons to show you when a photo, video or sound is
available. Grolier's doesn't do that _ ancillary stuff is included
in a pull-down menu.
</P>
<P>
   However, a quick look at the little manual or a glance at the
help screens will prevent this kind of problem.
</P>
<P>
   A two-disc encyclopedia, it can behave very strangely if you
don't change discs just the way it tells you to, and my text
windows had an unfortunate tendency to come up in a nearly
unreadable script font.
</P>
<P>
   My usual checks revealed no insurmountable problems.
</P>
<P>
   The article on flamenco is exceedingly brief, and online
articles yield little more.
</P>
<P>
   There is no reference to the Three Guardsmen _ Deputy U.S.
Marshals Bill Tilghman, Heck Thomas and Chris Madsen _ or to Bill
Doolin, their greatest nemesis. There is, curously, a paragraph on
Cat Thompson, a three-time All-America basketball player for
Montana State in the 1930s. Grolier is big on sports.
</P>
<P>
   The article on bullfighting is quite adequate to the
encyclopedia's purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Music is a mixed bag. Composers do not seem to be awarded aural
samples according to their stature; Mozart is represented only by a
smidgen of Eiene Kleine Nachtmusik, execrably presented via
synthesizer. The presentation of the music is also random; an
excerpt from the first movement of Beethoven's 5th symphony is
played by orchestra, while excerpts from the 6th are done,
inaccurately, on a synthesizer.
</P>
<P>
   I can't imagine why publishers continue to let this happen. How
much more can it cost to acquire a snippet of orchestral music than
the same snippet butchered on a synthesizer? Presumably it requires
more space to store _ but I believe students would benefit more
from a few bars of Beethoven's 6th played the way he wrote it on
the instruments he intended than they would from a biography of Cat
Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   Articles on the major composers, however, are quite generous,
and there are brief synopses of the plots of major operas.
</P>
<P>
   The panoramic scenes are plentiful, and reasonably well
realized. The list of videos includes most of the old standbys.
</P>
<P>
   Articles are well written and appear to contain more than enough
material to satisfy the needs of high school students. Authors are
cited for major articles.
</P>
<P>
   The two-disc encyclopedia itself sells for about $50; the
version I looked at came as the Grolier Multimedia Reference Suite,
with three other disks; the Wall Street Journal Almanac, a Hammond
atlas, Bartlett's Familiar Quotations, and, for some reason, a
thin, hardbound grammar text.
</P>
<P>
   The Bartlett's is in an ``Expanded Multimedia Edition,'' a
bizarre thing in which pictures and even musical excerpts are
strewn among the quotations, but have absolutely nothing to do with
them.
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, that's multimedia.

OS 8.5 fixes problems with system 
By Charles Haddad  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You've heard that it's faster. You've heard it has a
much more powerful search engine. But did you know OS 8.5 will
automatically check your hard disk for problems and fix any ones if
found?
</P>
<P>
   This is just one of the many small but important improvements
Apple Computer has added to the latest version of the software,
called the operating system, or OS. Some have likened the purpose
of an OS to a computer's central nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the Mac's OS was getting a little unstable. But with
each incremental improvement during the past two years, the OS has
gotten stronger and stronger. OS 8.5 is the strongest enhancement
yet.
</P>
<P>
   I've written about the big improvements, including the powerful
new find system and speed enhancements. Now I'm going to address
some of the smaller yet important improvements and additions in OS
8.5.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more significant of those is an automatic problem
detection system. Whenever you start up your Mac, the OS now checks
your hard drive for any damage to files or directories and, if it
finds problems, it tries to repair it. Such preventive maintenance
can prevent small problems from becoming big ones that might bring
down your Mac.
</P>
<P>
   In OS 8.5, Apple Computer has added a popular feature pioneered
by Netscape Navigator. You can add favorite files, folders and Web
sites to a handy list and quickly jump to them.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Apple Menu is a folder titled Favorites. Add items to
this folder by holding down the Apple command key and clicking the
mouse. Up will pop a menu of commands, which includes an Add to
Favorites item. Highlight and release this command to add stuff to
the favorites folder.
</P>
<P>
   OS 8.5 makes it easy to see what application is currently
running and switch among various applications. It does this through
a new feature called Application Switcher.
</P>
<P>
   The name of any active application is now displayed in the upper
right-hand corner of the menu bar with OS 8.5. Drag and drop that
name onto the desktop, and it turns into a little panel. Listed in
the panel are icons representing any running applications.
</P>
<P>
   To switch among applications, you click on its icon in the
panel. You can also cycle through running applications by pressing
the Command and Tab keys.
</P>
<P>
   As with everything with OS 8.5, Application Switcher is easy to
customize.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, OS 8.5 only works on PowerPC-based Macs. Those of
you with earlier models are out of luck. OS 8.5 retails for $99.

US MOVES TO PROTECT INTERNET COMMERCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By AARON ZITNER   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, invoking a future in which
Internet commerce helps everyone from American holiday shoppers to
impoverished Third World farmers, unveiled new steps Monday to
encourage more people to buy and sell products on line.
</P>
<P>
   In accepting a report from his staff on Internet shopping, the
president called for stronger fraud and privacy protections to make
people more comfortable with electronic commerce, or e-commerce.
But those protections should come from industry, not from new laws,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people who surf the Web still don't shop there,'' Clinton
said. ``They worry they won't get what they thought they were
paying for; they'll have nowhere to go if they get cheated.''
</P>
<P>
   He said these fears should be addressed ``not with burdensome
regulations that might stifle growth and innovation, but with
incentives for on-line companies to offer customers the protections
they need.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's address, to staff and business executives near the
White House, was part cheerleading session for the Internet and
part goodbye party for Ira Magaziner, a longtime Clinton friend and
adviser who supervised the Internet report.
</P>
<P>
   Magaziner, a longtime businessman and political activist in
Rhode Island and Massachusetts, will return to New England this
month (December) after six years as a senior adviser to the
president. Magaziner was a key adviser on Clinton's 1994 health
plan, which died amid a massive fight in Congress. After that
bruising defeat, Clinton asked him to work in a different policy
area, and in 1995 Magaziner began helping to formulate
administration policy on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In its report, Magaziner's inter-agency group calls for the
government to create new incentives for companies to invest in
high-speed networks so that material can be downloaded from the
Internet more quickly. Clinton said Monday he had instructed
several agencies to work on that issue with the independent Federal
Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, FCC Chairman William Kennard said his agency
would try to create more competition among telephone, cable, and
other companies in offering high-speed Internet connections to
consumers. But he offered no specifics. ``This creates a new sense
of urgency for those of is in government,'' he said of the
Magaziner report.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also called on the FTC to continue its efforts to
enforce fraud and consumer protection laws on the Internet.
Magaziner said the federal government would urge other countries to
sign treaties that extend similar protections to consumers who
cross national borders when they buy goods over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should get what they pay for on line,'' Clinton said.
``It should be easy to get redress if they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also instructed the State Department to find ways to
spur e-commerce in developing countries. As a model, Vice President
Al Gore cited a Peruvian town that had quintupled its income by
using the Internet to sell its vegetables in New York.
</P>
<P>
   A central issue in e-commerce involves consumer privacy: what
information businesses should be able to collect from consumers,
and what they may do with that information. Magaziner said the
Clinton administration backed an industry self-policing plan in
which companies that adhere to standard practices can display a
special ``seal of approval'' on their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Several private groups are offering these seals, including the
Council of Better Business Bureaus and an organization called
TRUSTe. In order to display a seal, companies must offer consumers
a clear statement of what information is being collected about
them, how it is being used, and what they can do to correct errors
and control the spread of the information.
</P>
<P>
   Magaziner predicted that by March, companies responsible for 70
percent of e-commerce will adopt a privacy seal. He said trade
groups in Japan and Australia had agreed to adopt a similar system
so that the same seals can be used worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The administration approach has drawn several critics. At the
Center for Democracy and Technology, a nonprofit civil liberties
group, Deirdre Mulligan said the administration had failed to
follow through on an earlier promise to assess whether
self-regulation was truly protecting consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not clear right now whether self-regulation is working...
and the administration should say what it will do if it doesn't
work,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, Solveig
Singleton said the government may have already used too heavy a
hand in protecting privacy. She questioned whether companies had
adopted privacy seals in the best interest of consumers, or because
the government had threatened to pass its own burdensome rules if
they did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is all kinds of experimentation going on about when
consumers care about confidentiality and when they do not, and
about how you have a relationship on line,'' she said, adding that
government privacy rules could stifle that experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   The event Monday provided a rousing send-off for Magaziner. In
his speech, Clinton thanked him for his work and called him ``my
friend of 30 years now.'' In the audience were Magaziner's wife,
Suzanne, and their three children.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of his White House service, Magaziner said: ``I feel
good about it, particularly the last couple of years. It's nice to
succeed at something, though I'm still proud of what we've done''
in health care policy.

able to access (our) brands anywhere, at any time, and from any
device.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh yeah. It sure sounds like good old Bill Gates pushing Windows
again, eh?
</P>
<P>
   Guess again. It was Steve Case, the head honcho at America
Online, commenting a few days ago on huge $4.2 billion AOL
acquisition of Netscape and the pair's agreement to work with Sun
Microsystems through the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The entire quote was, ``We share with Sun a vision for the
future in which consumers will be able to access America Online
brands anywhere, at any time, and from any device.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers were quick to predict that last week's
AOL/Netscape/Sun deal would create a computing and online megabeast
capable of giving that nasty ol' Microsoft a good beating.
</P>
<P>
   Before you start cheering, though, remember that age-old
warning: ``Be careful what you wish for . . .''
</P>
<P>
   The way Case is talking, the world could just be trading a nasty
ol' Microsoft for a nasty ol' AOL.
</P>
<P>
   The Dulles, Va., online behemoth has more than 14 million
customers and one of the top three or four most-popular Web sites
on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Couple that with the widely used Netscape browser, Navigator,
and add in the 20 million people who regularly visit Netscape's
existing Web site, and you've got yourself one heck of a 500-pound
gorilla.
</P>
<P>
   And we all know that old joke: ``What does a 500-pound gorilla
eat for lunch? Anything he pleases!''
</P>
<P>
   If you are an AOL customer, or if you ever have been, you know
that the browser in AOL's proprietary software is kinda stinky.
Even in the last year or so, when the AOL browser was supposed to
have been a version of Microsoft's Internet Explorer, it still
failed, running slowly, badly or not at all.
</P>
<P>
   How long do you think that will continue now that this merger
has surfaced? I bet software developers the world over are already
retooling their products to better serve AOL and Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   It might not be long before the world starts complaining about
the power of the AOL/Netscape gorilla, much like it now does about
the domination of Microsoft and its Windows operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   That will only leave consumers, once again, with fewer choices,
despite what Case tells interviewers on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   If you ask me, we ought to take some of that worry we've
assigned to the Y2K problem and redirect it toward megamergers like
this one. &QL; 
Your take on Microsoft
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, I tossed out a request for people to write in
with their thoughts on the government's antitrust lawsuit against
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what some of you had to say:
</P>
<P>
   From Tom: ``I just wanted to write and comment on Microsoft,
mainly on the people who say they hate Microsoft and people that
say they won't use Microsoft products. Microsoft has created an
operating system as well as compatibility with hardware and
software that makes production quicker, jobs simpler and Web access
a breeze. It has also created hundreds of thousands of jobs
creating and supporting not only their software, but many other
applications. So what if their OS has a mind of its own, so do most
automobiles and VCRs. People, quit complaining and start enjoying
your computer on behalf of the best software company in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   From Floyd: `Questions that I would love to see Department of
Justice put to Microsoft:
</P>
<P>
   1. Why does Microsoft package and sell its Word, Powerpoint &AMP;
Excel products separately and NOT the browser Explorer?
</P>
<P>
   2. Put another way: Why was it necessary to integrate Internet
Explorer with the Windows operating system and NOT Word, Powerpoint
&AMP; Excel?
</P>
<P>
   I suggest the following answer: Because Microsoft could not put
Netscape out of business if they priced and sold Explorer
separately to start with.''
</P>
<P>
   From Jim: ``I believe they're a great company, but one that has
abused its power for the want of even greater control of anything
involving software for computers and/or computer communications. In
addition, I find Microsoft very devious in that you buy a product
with seemingly no connection to them and suddenly discover that the
program is dependent on Microsoft's browser. Unbelievable. This has
personally happened to me with two programs.''
</P>
<P>
   From David: ``I agree that Microsoft should be a little less
aggressive and a little more focused on product features and
quality. However, I would add that lots of us could be less
sensitive to the `bad' things Microsoft is supposedly doing. Just
use the stuff, and be glad we don't have to put up with the way
computers used to behave just a few years ago. I think Microsoft
has been a godsend, and I like most of their products.'' &QL; 
News from all over
</P>
<P>
   - IBM recently unveiled what it says is the world's highest
capacity hard drive for desktop PCs. The company calls the
25-gigabyte monster the ``Deskstar 25GP.'' To put that capacity
into perspective, IBM says the drive is large enough to hold ``the
double-spaced typed text on a stack of paper more than 4,000 feet
high, more than six full-length feature films or 20,000 digital
images.'' Hmm. That would take a while to fill! No word yet on what
this baby costs.
</P>
<P>
   - Don't know where the computing world is headed? Don't feel
bad. Apparently nobody else does, either. A recent conference in
Santa Clara, Calif., made that fact painfully obvious. Such
high-tech gurus as analyst Esther Dyson and editors of the
investment magazine ``The RedHerring'' were full of opinions on the
future. And many of them were contradictory. ``Herring'' editors,
for example, said that Internet access will be close to free within
10 years. Dyson, however, said top-quality Net access will continue
to cost money.
</P>
<P>
   It all seemed so nice . . .
</P>
<P>
   This week's dose of humor comes from my friend Owen in Silicon
Valley:
</P>
<P>
   One day, a highly successful Wall Street executive was hit by a
bus and died. Her soul went to heaven, where she met St. Peter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to Heaven,'' St. Peter said. ``However, before you get
settled in, it seems we have a problem. You see, strangely enough,
we've never once had an executive make it this far and we're not
really sure what to do with you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No problem, just let me in,'' the woman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'd like to, but I have higher orders. What we're going
to do is let you have a day in hell and a day in heaven and then
you can choose whichever one you want to spend an eternity in.''
</P>
<P>
   So, St. Peter put the executive in an elevator and it went
down-down-down to hell. The doors opened and she found herself
stepping out onto the putting green of a beautiful golf course. In
the distance was a country club where everyone was dressed in
evening gowns and formal wear. They all cheered, and welcomed her
warmly.
</P>
<P>
   Four of them played an excellent round of golf and at night they
all met at the country club where she enjoyed an exceptional
dinner. She met the Devil who was actually a really nice guy and
she had a great time telling jokes and dancing. She was having such
a good time that before she knew it, it was time to leave.
Everybody shook her hand and waved good-bye as she got on the
elevator.
</P>
<P>
   The elevator went up-up-up and opened back up at the Pearly
Gates where she found St. Peter waiting for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's time to spend a day in heaven,'' he said. So she
spent the next 24-hours lounging around on clouds and playing the
harp and singing. She found it very comfortable and relaxing and
before she knew it her 24 hours were up and St. Peter came and got
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you've spent a day in hell and you've spent a day in
heaven. Now you must choose your eternity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The woman paused for a second and then replied, ``Well, I never
thought I'd say this, I mean, heaven has been really great and all,
but I think I had a better time in hell.''
</P>
<P>
   So St. Peter escorted her to the elevator and again she went
down-down-down back to hell. When the doors of the elevator opened
she found herself standing in a desolate wasteland covered in
garbage and filth. She saw that everyone was dressed in tattered
clothing and were picking up the garbage and putting it in sacks.
</P>
<P>
   As the Devil came up to her, she said, ``I don't understand.
Yesterday I was here and there was a golf course and a country club
and we ate lobster and we danced and had a great time. Now all
there is a wasteland of garbage and everyone looks miserable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devil looked at her and smiled. ``Yesterday we were
recruiting you _ today you're staff.'' &QL;

MUSICAL POR TRAITS TAKE US TO SPOTS IN NEW ENGLAND  
 (ADV: WITH THREE PLACES-SIDE) 
</HEADLINE>
 PLACES-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - For composer Charles Ives, New England (begin ital)
was (end ital) America. He was born from the soil of New England
and finally was returned 79 years later to that same soil. He
inherited the culture of Emerson, Thoreau and Hawthorne and turned
it into sound.
</P>
<P>
   His piano sonata ``Concord, Mass. 1840-1860,'' his ``Holidays
Symphony'' and his Third Symphony (Camp Meeting) all grow from his
New England roots, full of the marching-band tunes, patriotic airs
and revival-meeting hymns he heard as a boy.
</P>
<P>
   But one piece above all sums up his New England experience, and
it is one of his easiest to digest and, therefore, most popular. It
is ``ThreePlaces in New England,'' and it describes in music three
very precise landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes called the New England Symphony, it was written by
Ives between 1903 and 1911. It contains three movements that are
unforgettable impressions of the land and people.
</P>
<P>
   Landscape plays a big part in the history of painting and hardly
less in literature. We can visit the very square foot of land in
Canada where painter Frederic Edwin Church stood to paint his
monumental Niagara Falls or we can tour the Lake District that
inspired William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not often that landscape inspires music. There is the
occasional ``Moldau'' or ``La Mer,'' but scene-painting in sound is
not often as precise as a painting. Smetana takes in the whole
river, not a single view, and Debussy's ocean is any ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ives gave us in his ``Three Places'' three distinct sites
that can be visited and enjoyed and compared with the sound
portraits.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent visit to the East, I made it my business to visit
the three spots Ives knew. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Shaw Memorial, Boston
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first section in Ives' music is titled ``The St. Gaudens in
Boston Common'' and is subtitled ``Col. Shaw and his Colored
Regiment.''
</P>
<P>
   The St. Gaudens is a Civil War monument, considered by some
people to be the best American example of memorial sculpture. It
was created by Augustus Saint-Gaudens and unveiled in 1897 at the
northeast end of Boston Common, across the street from the
Massachusetts Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   The deep-relief sculpture commemorates the 54th Massachusetts
Volunteer Infantry Regiment and its commander, Col. Robert Gould
Shaw, who died in the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   The 54th was unusual at the time because its enlisted ranks were
composed entirely of African-Americans. On May 28, 1863, the
largest crowd in Boston's history came out to see the 54th march
off. They saw the thousand Black soldiers marching, accompanied by
their White officers on horseback.
</P>
<P>
   A souvenir of the day quoted Byron: ``Who would be free,
themselves must strike the blow.''
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, Shaw and a third of his command were dead,
killed in the attack on South Carolina's Fort Wagner in Charleston
Harbor. Their charge had failed, but the soldiers had fought so
well that they legitimized what had been considered a questionable
idea: African-Americans in combat.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw initially was buried in a common combat grave with his dead
troops, and after the war, when plans were made to exhume the
gallant young officer and give him an official ceremony in a
Massachusetts cemetery, his parents refused, writing that they
could hope for ``no holier place'' for him than ``surrounded by his
brave and devoted soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   Saint-Gaudens, America's premier sculptor at the time, was
commissioned in 1883 to monumentalize Shaw, and briefly considered
a standard equestrian statue, but finally decided that the Black
troops deserved the memorial as much as Shaw and devised plans to
include them.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to represent the soldiers accurately; some were as
young as 16, others were bearded grandfathers. So he hired
African-Americans to pose for him and made 40 heads as studies.
Sixteen went into the final bronze.
</P>
<P>
   So Shaw rides his horse in front of a rhythmical line of
marching soldiers, their heads, sleeping packs and rifles creating
a visual drumbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Ives' 8-minute portrait of the monument is a diffuse, dissonant
wash, as though not only the images of the Civil War but also its
very idea were obscured in the haze of memory and history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moving _ marching _ faces of souls! Marked with the
generations of pain, Part-freers of a destiny, slowly, restlessly
swaying us on with you towards other freedom!'' Ives wrote in his
score.
</P>
<P>
   The monument was only a few years old when Ives began writing
about it, and the layers of time show through in the music: the
war, the remembrance of war, the causes and unfinished business of
the war in a conflicting mass of sound.
</P>
<P>
   Often, in the welter, you can make out a familiar tune:
``Marching Through Georgia'' or ``Battle Hymn of the Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   Then it all fades away into the nostalgic past.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the sculpture is nearly black in its patina. It sits on
its granite plinth looking vaguely like a plaque on a headstone.
The tour buses stop, and the tourists pour out with their cameras.
Some shoot the gold-domed statehouse, others shoot the St. Gaudens.
</P>
<P>
   One bus unloads two dozen Japanese tourists. They also point
their cameras. The amplified sound of a tour guide overpowers the
street noise _ but in Japanese _ and I cannot possibly know what
she is saying or what the Japanese tourists can make of the racial
complexity involved in the war, the monument and American history. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Putnam's Camp
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The second movement is called ``Putnam's Camp, Redding,
Connecticut.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Israel Putnam, like most American generals in the
Revolutionary War, was better known for strategic and tactical
retreats than for victories. Charged with holding the Hudson
Highlands in 1777, he lost Fort Monroe and Fort Clinton while
backing up into Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   He and his troops wintered near Redding, Conn., in 1778,
undergoing much of the same privation and hardship Washington
endured at Valley Forge.
</P>
<P>
   But Ives isn't remembering the Revolutionary War in his music.
Rather, he is remembering his childhood, when he used to visit the
site of Putnam's Camp and fantasize what it must have been like in
the winter of 1778-79.
</P>
<P>
   He also recalls the patriotic Fourth of July picnics he attended
there and the brass bands that played.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long rows of stone campfire-places still remain to stir a
child's imagination,'' Ives wrote.
</P>
<P>
   What he hears is a grand cacophony of marching bands, playing
different tunes at the same time. It is loud, bouncy and
ear-blasting, getting louder and louder, with strains of ``The
British Grenadiers'' and other songs, and ending in a misquoted bar
and a half of reveille.
</P>
<P>
   It is all a jolly 6-minute joke but the kind of music Ives loved
best. ``Pretty sounds are for pretty ears,'' he said, deriding
those who wanted pleasant melodies from his orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Once, upset over the hoots and boos of an audience listening to
some modern music, Ives got out of his seat and exhorted the
unappreciative crowd to ``Stand up and take your music like a
man!''
</P>
<P>
   Putnam's Camp is today a state park, half on the east side of
Connecticut 58, half on the west. It is the eastern half that is
most visited; it has a lake, a parking lot and picnic tables, and
many of the people who come there probably give little thought to
the Colonial army that once wintered there.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the road, there is a path through the woods
that passes the lines of camp hearths and a hilltop cemetery full
of the unmarked graves of those who died fighting for American
independence.
</P>
<P>
   At the lake, a man _ who looks like he's playing hooky from work
_ casts his fishing line into the water. The fall remnants of
waterlily leaves are curled and brown on the water, and a few
Canada geese honk on the lawn.
</P>
<P>
   The sky is overcast, and the woods are brown as tweed, with
neither shadows nor highlights. And the old-fashioned New England
Fourth of July patriotic and religious picnic is as much a part of
the past as Putnam's war. &QL; 
Housatonic at Stockbridge
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The last section of ``Three Places in New England'' is perhaps
the most moving. It is ``The Housatonic at Stockbridge.''
</P>
<P>
   That is, the Housatonic River at Stockbridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The Housatonic is one of those alternating lazy and cascading
streams that run from north to south, along which New England's
factories were built in the early years of the Industrial
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   It begins at a small pond in Washington, Mass., and wends its
way 149 miles to Long Island Sound at Stratford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Along its banks are both towns and woods. Ives honeymooned in
the Berkshires in 1908 with his new wife, Harmony, and one Sunday
morning, they strolled near Stockbridge and the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``We walked in the meadows along the river,'' he wrote many
years later, ``and heard the distant singing from the church across
the river. The mist had not entirely left the riverbed and the
colors, the running water, the banks and the trees were something
that one would always remember.''
</P>
<P>
   The 4-minute movement that Ives wrote captures the quiet and the
mist: It is ambiguous tonally and melodically, like a remembered
dream, builds to a climax that evaporates abruptly, uncovering the
quiet chords playing on the orchestral strings as if they had been
sounding all along, but drowned out by the noise.
</P>
<P>
   Like the strings in Ives' ``Unanswered Question,'' which are
drowned out by chattering woodwinds, the final quiet strings in
``Three Places'' are the eternal harmonies of nature.
</P>
<P>
   Ives liked his piece well enough that he turned it into a song
later, with words by poet Robert Underwood Johnson:
</P>
<P>
   ``Contented river! In thy dreamy realm _ the cloudy willow and
the plumy elm.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an elegy to nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   Stockbridge has changed since the Iveses visited. It is now a
prime tourist destination, full of gift shops and art galleries,
with frozen yogurt.It is also the home of the Norman Rockwell
Museum. Rockwell made his home there and used Stockbridge natives
as models for his magazine-cover paintings.
</P>
<P>
   The river eases in and out of town, crossed by four or five
small bridges. The Housatonic is an average of only 35 yards across
in Stockbridge, hardly more than a brook.
</P>
<P>
   On a cloudy day in October, it also is hidden by the grayness. I
have visited every spot along the river in town and enjoyed its
quiet but missed its beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Until late that afternoon when I stand on the hill by the
Rockwell Museum looking over the river out at Pleasant Hill and a
chink in the clouds widens, throwing a spotlight on the meadow
across the water. The bare winter sycamores along its banks
suddenly stand out like neon, and the band of sunlight sweeps from
left to right, finally in its passing leaving the scene in gray
once more.
</P>
<P>
   And the riverbed and the colors, the running water, the banks
and the trees were something that one would always remember. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Harvest basket
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The search for Ives' three places has turned into a pile of time
on time, present on past, past on deeper past, all wound up in a
single point of geography.
</P>
<P>
   It is as if the Indians, who were in New England before the
Pilgrims came, had a deeper understanding of reality. When
something happens, they believed, it is always happening. Time is
not a straight line but a basket full of harvest, all piled in
together.
</P>
<P>
   So that I cannot see this single piece of real estate, the
Housatonic, the Yankee military camp or the St. Gaudens statue,
without thinking of history, memory, my past and my nation's past,
all balled up into a single, complex thing.
</P>
<P>
   All happening at once and all happening in my eye, looking at
the past.
</P>
<P>
   And I know it is not just true for these three places, caught in
Ives' web of meaningful noise, but for all places and all times. &QL;

IVES MERGED EXPERIMENTATION WITH NOS TALGIA  
 (ADV: WITH THREE PLACES) 
</HEADLINE>
 PLACES-SIDE-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Charles Ives, educated at Yale, and who became a
wealthy insurance executive, was a father figure for U.S.
composers.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Ives is the father of American music.
</P>
<P>
   Before him, what American composers wrote for the concert hall
was a dim reflection of European _ and especially German _ art
music, with its sonatas and symphonies. After him, it was possible
to feel truly American.
</P>
<P>
   You can see his influence in the folk tunes that show up in
Aaron Copland, the spare orchestrations and open harmonies of Roy
Harris and the avant-garde fun John Cage has with noise.
</P>
<P>
   Ives was a funny duck. Born in 1874, he studied composition at
Yale, but instead of becoming a poverty-stricken composer, he
became a wealthy insurance executive. Ives and his partner, Julian
Myrick, founded a successful agency that pioneered much of the
industry's modern practice. Myrick had the business sense, Ives
brought the creativity.
</P>
<P>
   Together they prospered, ultimately becoming the largest
insurance agency in America. In 1929, the firm sold $49 million
worth of insurance.
</P>
<P>
   But he was also a genius in music, taking little stock of what
he learned from his stuffy college professors and feeding large on
the oddball music education he received from his father, George
Ives, who was bandmaster for the small Connecticut town of Danbury.
</P>
<P>
   George Ives loved to experiment with sound, playing with
microtones, out-of-tune instruments, polytonality and organized
noise. That enthusiasm for experiment, which in George was a
variety of practical Yankee inventiveness, became for his son a
creed and a muse.
</P>
<P>
   Yet although Charles Ives' music was more modern than
Stravinsky's and more dissonant than Bartok's, he really was not
concerned with fitting into the long history of European art music.
It is obvious in the music; Ives was not writing about modern
things.
</P>
<P>
   For although the music is filled with ear-splitting dissonances,
it is unabashedly nostalgic. Ives felt a powerful nostalgia for the
past _ his past _ and his music drips with bits of the music he
heard when he was a boy: old hymn tunes and marching-band music.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how loud and incoherent Ives sounds at first, at long
last, it settles into ``Bringing in the Sheaves'' and ``Columbia
the Gem of the Ocean'' _ not whole but in snippets, as if
half-remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Ives wrote the bulk of his music in the first years of this
century. His business and his ailments _ he suffered from a poor
heart muscle _ kept him from concentrating on composition after
1918.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps, as Ives' early biographers, Henry and Sidney Cowell,
suggested, ``The war was a shock of the first magnitude to a man
whose life was based on his confidence in human progress.''
</P>
<P>
   He lived on until 1954, becoming for many American composers a
kind of father figure and rallying point. &QL;

THIS IS AS FUN TO DECORATE AS IT IS TO EAT  
 (ADV: WITH GINGERBREAD. INCLUDES RECIPE AND TIPS)

<P>
   UNDATED - So you think maybe, just maybe, despite Kathleen
Ingley's dire warnings, that you want to decorate a gingerbread
house.
</P>
<P>
   Never fear. Meet Cathy Wochner of Phoenix. On Sunday (note: dec.
6) she will have three generations around her dining room table,
making gingerbread houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fun is building memories,'' Wochner says. ``They look back
every year and say, `Wow, this is what we did last year.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Her three sons grew up making and nibbling on their mother's
baked architecture around the holidays. Now, they bring their
families, girlfriends, and Wochner's 2{-year-old granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   After years of experimentation, Wochner developed a gingerbread
house plan that bakes in one jellyroll pan. It makes a small house
approximately 6 inches square, perfect for individual decorating.
Since you can bake the house and let it stand for up to a week
before covering it with cute candy, you have time (theoretically!)
to make one for each child in the family.
</P>
<P>
   And, let's face it, big kids love to decorate gingerbread
houses, too.
</P>
<P>
   For six years, Wochner had a business making gingerbread houses,
and sold 1,000 videos on the subject. She since has moved on to
other things and says no to the calls she still gets from people
who want her to bake gingerbread houses for them. She has gone back
to the tradition of making them just for family.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, kits and cast-iron plaques and all other sorts of
short-cuts to making candy condos have evolved. And Wochner
approves of them all. If you can't bake, go ahead and buy the
undecorated houses, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those work!'' she said. ``Buy five and spend an evening around
the table. It's absolutely fabulous. I encourage people to bring
what they want to nibble on. Of course, the house doesn't smell as
good; that's a drawback. But that's OK. It's a '90s kind of
thing.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Gingerbread House &QL; 
 &QL; 
(From Cathy Wochner) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   3 teaspoons baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon powdered ginger
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon allspice
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon cloves
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup brown sugar, packed
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup light molasses
</P>
<P>
   1 egg, beaten
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup oil plus 1/4 cup for greasing pan
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Royal icing: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 egg whites
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons cream of tartar
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds powdered sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/8 cup water
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
In a medium bowl, thoroughly blend dry ingredients. Add the
molasses, beaten egg, and half-cup of oil. Blend thoroughly. Chill
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Oil a 12- by 18-inch jellyroll pan
(no other size) with the additional quarter-cup of oil. Roll dough
very evenly, making absolutely sure the extra oil is absorbed into
the dough. Fill pan completely with dough and roll smooth. Before
going into the oven, the dough must be oily and smooth _ this is
the secret to a beautiful gingerbread house. Bake 35 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   While still hot, quickly lay pattern pieces on dough and cut out
shapes. Lift out carefully and cool on racks until gingerbread is
hard and cool. If necessary to harden, pieces can be put back in
the oven on cooling rack for 5 to 10 minutes longer.
</P>
<P>
   For icing: beat egg whites and cream of tartar until very stiff.
Gradually add powdered sugar, also adding a little water to make
the proper consistency. Keep covered with damp cloth at all times.
</P>
<P>
   Makes one gingerbread house. &QL; 
GINGERBREAD HOUSE TIPS &QL; 
 &QL; 
- You will need a base for the house, such as a 14-inch round of
cardboard. &QL; 
- To glue the house together with royal icing, you also will need a
large pastry bag with plastic coupling and two tips, including a
small one for writing and making icicles, and a large one for major
``cement.'' All are sold as cake-decorating supplies. &QL; 
- Humidity will soften the dough, so don't try to make gingerbread
houses when it rains. &QL; 
- Don't double the recipe to make more than one house. Bake each
batch separately. &QL; 
- To decorate your house, remember small candies will look best on
a small house. Cereals make good construction materials, such as
shredded wheat for thatched roofs. &QL;

VISION OF GINGERBREAD BECOMES CONSTRUCTION NIGHTMARE  
 (ADV: PHOTO IS BEING SENT TO NYTNS CLIENTS. WITH
GINGERBREAD-SIDE) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KATHLEEN INGLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic

<P>
   UNDATED - The holiday lights are twinkling, the stores are
filled with the strains of ``Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer,'' and
you can't help feeling the nostalgic urge to make a gingerbread
house. Take my advice: Lie down until the feeling passes.
</P>
<P>
   My own moment of weakness came last December, when I was getting
down the boxes of Christmas trappings and decorations. There,
making me feel guilty once again, was the never-opened box with a
kit to make a gingerbread house.
</P>
<P>
   My children were in their teens, and I'd never made them a
gingerbread house. If I didn't act now, they'd have one more
complaint to bring up in future therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The box held almost everything I'd need: a stone mold for the
walls, roof and chimney; a cloth tube for squirting frosting; and a
booklet with the directions and recipe.
</P>
<P>
   My trip to the supermarket was an omen.
</P>
<P>
   Clutching the booklet, I steered my cart through the
holiday-crowded story. I'm not the cook in our household, so I was
tracking down ingredients I hadn't bought in years. If ever.
</P>
<P>
   Ginger, of course. Molasses. Multicolored sprinkles.
</P>
<P>
   But I scoured the shelves without finding cream of tartar. From
watching my mother cook when I was a kid, I had a dim recollection
of a white powder that had something to do with thickening. I was
tempted to skip it altogether. But just then a clerk happened by,
so I asked him where to find it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cream of tartar?'' he asked doubtfully. ``Like tartar sauce?
Wouldn't that be over by the fish?''
</P>
<P>
   I gave up and went through the checkout line, humming Christmas
carols to myself. But when I got home, my mood darkened: I'd lost
the crucial booklet with all the directions.
</P>
<P>
   Even after a trip back to the store, retracing my steps with the
vigilance of Sherlock Holmes, I couldn't find the book. However, I
did find a clerk who knew cream of tartar.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, I dug through yellowed and aging cookbooks without
spotting a gingerbread recipe that seemed likely to produce a house
that would stay upright. Then I recalled a cute flier of holiday
tips and recipes that my husband threw away. I fished it out of the
trash.
</P>
<P>
   Bingo.
</P>
<P>
   The actual baking went surprisingly well. I had no idea whether
to grease the mold, but figured a light oiling wouldn't hurt. I
baked a separate sheet of cut-out dough to stop the family from
nibbling on the house. I shouldn't have worried. The dough cooked
up like a rock.
</P>
<P>
   Perfect for construction, I thought. I started mixing up the
frosting to use as mortar. Now, I don't actually have a mixer, but
I figured a fork would do just as well for ``mix at high speed for
3-4 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   I carefully drizzled frosting along all the edges and lined the
pieces up. The house imploded.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe the best technique was one side at a time. I balanced
two walls together, positioned the other two, added a piece of
roof. It all fell down.
</P>
<P>
   Variations of this scenario continued for the next half-hour.
</P>
<P>
   OK, I finally decided, no one was going to eat this gingerbread
house, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   It was time for glue. The Goop glue had an uncanny resemblance
to the frosting as I squeezed it along the gingerbread. And it had
an uncanny resemblance to frosting as the entire house fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe that was the wrong kind of glue.
</P>
<P>
   So I whipped out the Duco cement. Two walls and a chimney seemed
to be holding. I gently attached the other walls and squeezed the
building together. The chimney broke. The roof slid off. My hands
were coated with dried glue.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so this was really a craft project.
</P>
<P>
   So I got the fabric paste. I slathered it on the walls and roof.
I tried to reconstruct the chimney.
</P>
<P>
   The doorbell rang. The house fell down.
</P>
<P>
   ``What on earth are you doing?'' asked my friend Barbara,
coughing a bit from the glue fumes.
</P>
<P>
   But she saved the house.
</P>
<P>
   She started with toothpicks, gently driving them in like nails
in the thicker parts and breaking off the ends. Then she called for
straight pins, carefully joining the thinner spots. The colored
pinheads looked like little candies.
</P>
<P>
   I retreated while my daughter Rachel did the final decorating. I
did hear her call out, ``This frosting tube should have had a
closed end.''
</P>
<P>
   I guess that's why there was icing on the floor, the counter,
the table, the refrigerator, the cat dish.
</P>
<P>
   When we were out at a restaurant that night, my husband leaned
over and whispered, ``What's that white stuff in your hair?''
</P>
<P>
   And he couldn't understand why it was February before I was
willing to take the gingerbread house off display on the mantel.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson No. 1: A gingerbread house doesn't need a cook but a
carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson No. 2: Those ready-made gingerbread houses at the
supermarket are a steal. &QL;

 &HT;    RESENDING CORRECTED VERSION. USE THIS
 &HT;    More of same from still rockin' Stones
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault, Doug Hamilton, Steve Dollar and Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the question is whether this live album is necessary, then
the answer _ one being volunteered by many critics _ is a
resounding ``No.'' It's the umpteenth live recording from the
Stones, whose music is also available on some 50 other releases.
But if the question is, does ``No Security'' satisfyingly document
the band's just-ended tour, the answer is an equally resounding
``Yes.'' It captures the ability of fiftysomething Mick Jagger &AMP;
Co. to still raise a sonic ruckus and delight fans with strong
versions of ``Sister Morphine,'' ``Gimme Shelter,'' ``The Last
Time'' and other tunes from a deep catalog. As the just-announced
plans for an arena tour starting in January indicate, the Stones
won't go away. So let 'em roll.

   The Grammy-winning singer of ``Sunny Came Home'' wishes you

Colvin's morose delivery on the already melancholy seasonal
standards ``Christmas Time Is Here'' and ``Silent Night'' may make
you want to throw yourself on the yule log. And while the
interspersed lullabies, including ``All the Pretty Li'l Horses''
are obviously close to the singer's heart _ she became a mother for
the first time last year _ they won't soothe an infant so much as
depress one. The perfect background music for a holiday party at

book, it's extensive in what it covers and highly selective in who
it covers, but consistently serves as an easy introduction to an

   It's been so unfair. For 40 years we have only been able to
experience the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater on stage. The
incredible blues (Hugh Masekela's ``Babjula Bonke''), gospel (``I
Been 'Buked''), and jazz (Charlie Parker's ``A Night in Tunisia'')
used to score the dancers' interpretations of slavery, the
pageantry of black churchgoing, and sinning have never been
available on one recording. So for many who have seen an Ailey
show, not being able to relive it audibly has been comparable to
being moved by a sermon on Sunday and not having a Bible to refer
to for reminders during the week. But now, finally, the soul of not
only Ailey, but some of the powerful experiences that make one
American, is captured in this cohesive and representative box set.

IVES MERGED EXPERIMENTATION WITH NOS TALGIA  
 (ADV: WITH THREE PLACES) 
</HEADLINE>
 PLACES-SIDE-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Charles Ives, educated at Yale, and who became a
wealthy insurance executive, was a father figure for U.S.
composers.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Ives is the father of American music.
</P>
<P>
   Before him, what American composers wrote for the concert hall
was a dim reflection of European _ and especially German _ art
music, with its sonatas and symphonies. After him, it was possible
to feel truly American.
</P>
<P>
   You can see his influence in the folk tunes that show up in
Aaron Copland, the spare orchestrations and open harmonies of Roy
Harris and the avant-garde fun John Cage has with noise.
</P>
<P>
   Ives was a funny duck. Born in 1874, he studied composition at
Yale, but instead of becoming a poverty-stricken composer, he
became a wealthy insurance executive. Ives and his partner, Julian
Myrick, founded a successful agency that pioneered much of the
industry's modern practice. Myrick had the business sense, Ives
brought the creativity.
</P>
<P>
   Together they prospered, ultimately becoming the largest
insurance agency in America. In 1929, the firm sold $49 million
worth of insurance.
</P>
<P>
   But he was also a genius in music, taking little stock of what
he learned from his stuffy college professors and feeding large on
the oddball music education he received from his father, George
Ives, who was bandmaster for the small Connecticut town of Danbury.
</P>
<P>
   George Ives loved to experiment with sound, playing with
microtones, out-of-tune instruments, polytonality and organized
noise. That enthusiasm for experiment, which in George was a
variety of practical Yankee inventiveness, became for his son a
creed and a muse.
</P>
<P>
   Yet although Charles Ives' music was more modern than
Stravinsky's and more dissonant than Bartok's, he really was not
concerned with fitting into the long history of European art music.
It is obvious in the music; Ives was not writing about modern
things.
</P>
<P>
   For although the music is filled with ear-splitting dissonances,
it is unabashedly nostalgic. Ives felt a powerful nostalgia for the
past _ his past _ and his music drips with bits of the music he
heard when he was a boy: old hymn tunes and marching-band music.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how loud and incoherent Ives sounds at first, at long
last, it settles into ``Bringing in the Sheaves'' and ``Columbia
the Gem of the Ocean'' _ not whole but in snippets, as if
half-remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Ives wrote the bulk of his music in the first years of this
century. His business and his ailments _ he suffered from a poor
heart muscle _ kept him from concentrating on composition after
1918.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps, as Ives' early biographers, Henry and Sidney Cowell,
suggested, ``The war was a shock of the first magnitude to a man
whose life was based on his confidence in human progress.''
</P>
<P>
   He lived on until 1954, becoming for many American composers a
kind of father figure and rallying point. &QL;

MUSICAL POR TRAITS TAKE US TO SPOTS IN NEW ENGLAND  
 (ADV: WITH THREE PLACES-SIDE) 
</HEADLINE>
 PLACES-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - For composer Charles Ives, New England (begin ital)
was (end ital) America. He was born from the soil of New England
and finally was returned 79 years later to that same soil. He
inherited the culture of Emerson, Thoreau and Hawthorne and turned
it into sound.
</P>
<P>
   His piano sonata ``Concord, Mass. 1840-1860,'' his ``Holidays
Symphony'' and his Third Symphony (Camp Meeting) all grow from his
New England roots, full of the marching-band tunes, patriotic airs
and revival-meeting hymns he heard as a boy.
</P>
<P>
   But one piece above all sums up his New England experience, and
it is one of his easiest to digest and, therefore, most popular. It
is ``ThreePlaces in New England,'' and it describes in music three
very precise landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes called the New England Symphony, it was written by
Ives between 1903 and 1911. It contains three movements that are
unforgettable impressions of the land and people.
</P>
<P>
   Landscape plays a big part in the history of painting and hardly
less in literature. We can visit the very square foot of land in
Canada where painter Frederic Edwin Church stood to paint his
monumental Niagara Falls or we can tour the Lake District that
inspired William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not often that landscape inspires music. There is the
occasional ``Moldau'' or ``La Mer,'' but scene-painting in sound is
not often as precise as a painting. Smetana takes in the whole
river, not a single view, and Debussy's ocean is any ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ives gave us in his ``Three Places'' three distinct sites
that can be visited and enjoyed and compared with the sound
portraits.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent visit to the East, I made it my business to visit
the three spots Ives knew. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Shaw Memorial, Boston
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first section in Ives' music is titled ``The St. Gaudens in
Boston Common'' and is subtitled ``Col. Shaw and his Colored
Regiment.''
</P>
<P>
   The St. Gaudens is a Civil War monument, considered by some
people to be the best American example of memorial sculpture. It
was created by Augustus Saint-Gaudens and unveiled in 1897 at the
northeast end of Boston Common, across the street from the
Massachusetts Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   The deep-relief sculpture commemorates the 54th Massachusetts
Volunteer Infantry Regiment and its commander, Col. Robert Gould
Shaw, who died in the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   The 54th was unusual at the time because its enlisted ranks were
composed entirely of African-Americans. On May 28, 1863, the
largest crowd in Boston's history came out to see the 54th march
off. They saw the thousand Black soldiers marching, accompanied by
their White officers on horseback.
</P>
<P>
   A souvenir of the day quoted Byron: ``Who would be free,
themselves must strike the blow.''
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, Shaw and a third of his command were dead,
killed in the attack on South Carolina's Fort Wagner in Charleston
Harbor. Their charge had failed, but the soldiers had fought so
well that they legitimized what had been considered a questionable
idea: African-Americans in combat.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw initially was buried in a common combat grave with his dead
troops, and after the war, when plans were made to exhume the
gallant young officer and give him an official ceremony in a
Massachusetts cemetery, his parents refused, writing that they
could hope for ``no holier place'' for him than ``surrounded by his
brave and devoted soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   Saint-Gaudens, America's premier sculptor at the time, was
commissioned in 1883 to monumentalize Shaw, and briefly considered
a standard equestrian statue, but finally decided that the Black
troops deserved the memorial as much as Shaw and devised plans to
include them.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to represent the soldiers accurately; some were as
young as 16, others were bearded grandfathers. So he hired
African-Americans to pose for him and made 40 heads as studies.
Sixteen went into the final bronze.
</P>
<P>
   So Shaw rides his horse in front of a rhythmical line of
marching soldiers, their heads, sleeping packs and rifles creating
a visual drumbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Ives' 8-minute portrait of the monument is a diffuse, dissonant
wash, as though not only the images of the Civil War but also its
very idea were obscured in the haze of memory and history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moving _ marching _ faces of souls! Marked with the
generations of pain, Part-freers of a destiny, slowly, restlessly
swaying us on with you towards other freedom!'' Ives wrote in his
score.
</P>
<P>
   The monument was only a few years old when Ives began writing
about it, and the layers of time show through in the music: the
war, the remembrance of war, the causes and unfinished business of
the war in a conflicting mass of sound.
</P>
<P>
   Often, in the welter, you can make out a familiar tune:
``Marching Through Georgia'' or ``Battle Hymn of the Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   Then it all fades away into the nostalgic past.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the sculpture is nearly black in its patina. It sits on
its granite plinth looking vaguely like a plaque on a headstone.
The tour buses stop, and the tourists pour out with their cameras.
Some shoot the gold-domed statehouse, others shoot the St. Gaudens.
</P>
<P>
   One bus unloads two dozen Japanese tourists. They also point
their cameras. The amplified sound of a tour guide overpowers the
street noise _ but in Japanese _ and I cannot possibly know what
she is saying or what the Japanese tourists can make of the racial
complexity involved in the war, the monument and American history. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Putnam's Camp
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The second movement is called ``Putnam's Camp, Redding,
Connecticut.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Israel Putnam, like most American generals in the
Revolutionary War, was better known for strategic and tactical
retreats than for victories. Charged with holding the Hudson
Highlands in 1777, he lost Fort Monroe and Fort Clinton while
backing up into Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   He and his troops wintered near Redding, Conn., in 1778,
undergoing much of the same privation and hardship Washington
endured at Valley Forge.
</P>
<P>
   But Ives isn't remembering the Revolutionary War in his music.
Rather, he is remembering his childhood, when he used to visit the
site of Putnam's Camp and fantasize what it must have been like in
the winter of 1778-79.
</P>
<P>
   He also recalls the patriotic Fourth of July picnics he attended
there and the brass bands that played.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long rows of stone campfire-places still remain to stir a
child's imagination,'' Ives wrote.
</P>
<P>
   What he hears is a grand cacophony of marching bands, playing
different tunes at the same time. It is loud, bouncy and
ear-blasting, getting louder and louder, with strains of ``The
British Grenadiers'' and other songs, and ending in a misquoted bar
and a half of reveille.
</P>
<P>
   It is all a jolly 6-minute joke but the kind of music Ives loved
best. ``Pretty sounds are for pretty ears,'' he said, deriding
those who wanted pleasant melodies from his orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Once, upset over the hoots and boos of an audience listening to
some modern music, Ives got out of his seat and exhorted the
unappreciative crowd to ``Stand up and take your music like a
man!''
</P>
<P>
   Putnam's Camp is today a state park, half on the east side of
Connecticut 58, half on the west. It is the eastern half that is
most visited; it has a lake, a parking lot and picnic tables, and
many of the people who come there probably give little thought to
the Colonial army that once wintered there.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the road, there is a path through the woods
that passes the lines of camp hearths and a hilltop cemetery full
of the unmarked graves of those who died fighting for American
independence.
</P>
<P>
   At the lake, a man _ who looks like he's playing hooky from work
_ casts his fishing line into the water. The fall remnants of
waterlily leaves are curled and brown on the water, and a few
Canada geese honk on the lawn.
</P>
<P>
   The sky is overcast, and the woods are brown as tweed, with
neither shadows nor highlights. And the old-fashioned New England
Fourth of July patriotic and religious picnic is as much a part of
the past as Putnam's war. &QL; 
Housatonic at Stockbridge
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The last section of ``Three Places in New England'' is perhaps
the most moving. It is ``The Housatonic at Stockbridge.''
</P>
<P>
   That is, the Housatonic River at Stockbridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The Housatonic is one of those alternating lazy and cascading
streams that run from north to south, along which New England's
factories were built in the early years of the Industrial
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   It begins at a small pond in Washington, Mass., and wends its
way 149 miles to Long Island Sound at Stratford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Along its banks are both towns and woods. Ives honeymooned in
the Berkshires in 1908 with his new wife, Harmony, and one Sunday
morning, they strolled near Stockbridge and the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``We walked in the meadows along the river,'' he wrote many
years later, ``and heard the distant singing from the church across
the river. The mist had not entirely left the riverbed and the
colors, the running water, the banks and the trees were something
that one would always remember.''
</P>
<P>
   The 4-minute movement that Ives wrote captures the quiet and the
mist: It is ambiguous tonally and melodically, like a remembered
dream, builds to a climax that evaporates abruptly, uncovering the
quiet chords playing on the orchestral strings as if they had been
sounding all along, but drowned out by the noise.
</P>
<P>
   Like the strings in Ives' ``Unanswered Question,'' which are
drowned out by chattering woodwinds, the final quiet strings in
``Three Places'' are the eternal harmonies of nature.
</P>
<P>
   Ives liked his piece well enough that he turned it into a song
later, with words by poet Robert Underwood Johnson:
</P>
<P>
   ``Contented river! In thy dreamy realm _ the cloudy willow and
the plumy elm.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an elegy to nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   Stockbridge has changed since the Iveses visited. It is now a
prime tourist destination, full of gift shops and art galleries,
with frozen yogurt.It is also the home of the Norman Rockwell
Museum. Rockwell made his home there and used Stockbridge natives
as models for his magazine-cover paintings.
</P>
<P>
   The river eases in and out of town, crossed by four or five
small bridges. The Housatonic is an average of only 35 yards across
in Stockbridge, hardly more than a brook.
</P>
<P>
   On a cloudy day in October, it also is hidden by the grayness. I
have visited every spot along the river in town and enjoyed its
quiet but missed its beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Until late that afternoon when I stand on the hill by the
Rockwell Museum looking over the river out at Pleasant Hill and a
chink in the clouds widens, throwing a spotlight on the meadow
across the water. The bare winter sycamores along its banks
suddenly stand out like neon, and the band of sunlight sweeps from
left to right, finally in its passing leaving the scene in gray
once more.
</P>
<P>
   And the riverbed and the colors, the running water, the banks
and the trees were something that one would always remember. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Harvest basket
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The search for Ives' three places has turned into a pile of time
on time, present on past, past on deeper past, all wound up in a
single point of geography.
</P>
<P>
   It is as if the Indians, who were in New England before the
Pilgrims came, had a deeper understanding of reality. When
something happens, they believed, it is always happening. Time is
not a straight line but a basket full of harvest, all piled in
together.
</P>
<P>
   So that I cannot see this single piece of real estate, the
Housatonic, the Yankee military camp or the St. Gaudens statue,
without thinking of history, memory, my past and my nation's past,
all balled up into a single, complex thing.
</P>
<P>
   All happening at once and all happening in my eye, looking at
the past.
</P>
<P>
   And I know it is not just true for these three places, caught in
Ives' web of meaningful noise, but for all places and all times. &QL;

MERGER ANNOUNCEMENT TAKES GAS STATION OWNERS BY SURPRISE
</HEADLINE>

By BILL BOWEN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ It's a long way from the Mobil Corp.
boardroom to Dennis Heiser's Mobil station on Loop 820 in North
Richland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Heiser has run the dealership for 23 years and has long enjoyed
a companionable relationship with the owner of the Exxon across the
street.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after Exxon and Mobil's megamerger, the Exxon station on
the opposite corner will be a brother business to Heiser's Mobil
station. What that means for dealers and consumers remains in
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all at a kind of a loss,'' Heiser said Tuesday.
``Usually, they tell us about something before it hits the papers.
But this came as a slap in the face.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies said that they will retain both brands at the
retail level. But regulators and consumers will be watching for
signs that the loss of competition hurts consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think many times it's better for the consumer to have more
brands and more competitors,'' said Lynton Allred, executive vice
president of the Austin-based Texas Petroleum Marketers and
Convenience Store Association. ``I think it might hurt consumers in
the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   The combined company will control almost 20 percent of the Texas
retail gasoline market. Exxon is the dominant player in the state,
with about 14 percent of the retail gasoline market, compared with
Mobil's 5 percent, according to Trilby Lundberg, a California-based
consumer research company.
</P>
<P>
   Mobil has recently shifted its retail presence in the state. In
October, it entered a venture with San Antonio-based Tetco to
operate its 145 Metroplex stations. Mobil retained a 49 percent
stake in local stores. In return, Tetco's 173 stores across the
state will sell Mobil products exclusively.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon has a stronger retail presence with hundreds of
company-owned outlets in Texas, which account for 30 percent of its
sales in the state. The remaining 70 percent of the sales are
handled by independent operators and convenience stores.
</P>
<P>
   The question for Allred and his association members is the same
for consumers: Will any of the company's estimated annual savings
of $2.15 billion to $3 billion mean lower gasoline prices?
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have said supply and demand play the key role in
dictating prices. And they noted that any corporate savings may
flow to the bottom line, boosting profits and perhaps stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   But as Allred says, ``If you can cut that much in operational
costs, someone is going to benefit.''

CLEANER GAS ENGINES MAY BE BETTER THAN ELECTRIC VEHICLES

   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT WINOKUR  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Randy Rentschler's first car was a tan 1970
Oldsmobile Cutlass with a four on the floor, dual carbs and a white
vinyl top. It was awful looking, but a pleasure to drive. He
totaled the thing a month after buying it.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Rentschler is a financial analyst for the Metropolitan
Transportation Commission in Alameda, Calif. At 38, he drives a
1988 Ford Ranger truck and a 1990 Ford Aerostar Van, while his wife
tools around in a Dodge Neon.
</P>
<P>
   Rentschler still loves cars, but it's more of a platonic thing
with him now. He reads about them, thinks about them and writes
about them. His home in Alameda is cluttered with Auto Week and
Road and Track magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, he's been pondering the future of motoring. With the
help of a fellow Transportation Commission worker, Marjorie
Blackwell, he pulled together everything pertinent about electric
cars and hybrids _ cars powered both by electricity and gas engines
_ in an edition of ``Transactions,'' the commission's newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, Rentschler and Blackwell contend, is that
electric vehicles, or EVs, aren't ready for prime time and may
never be. The battery is the reason. Thomas Edison couldn't get it
right a century ago and Detroit can't get it right today. Designers
still haven't solved the problems of range and recharge time.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you can plug the pollution-free cars into your household
current, but you'll be lucky to drive 100 miles before you need a
recharge, which could take up to six hours. More likely are the
combo vehicles, which rely on electric engines at lower speeds, gas
engines at higher ones _ and, best of all, recharge themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Rentschler said that state governments can push for EVs all they
like and the cars still won't catch on because they don't make
sense economically, particularly with gas so cheap.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are small, compact cars, which are a shrinking segment
of the market. But say you could get a mid-sized one. What you're
buying probably is pretty good around town. Take it down I-5 and
get it up to 70 miles an hour, however, and you'd be pushing the
technology,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds bad. But only if you take the short view, Rentschler
said. Because the Law of Unintended Consequences is playing a
behind-the-scenes role here, he explained, and everything could
work out fine environmentally.
</P>
<P>
   The net effect of the challenge posed to conventional vehicles
by EVs, Rentschler said, has been to push the automotive companies
to make cleaner combustion engines.
</P>
<P>
   Gas isn't burned perfectly _ and that's why there is pollution
in the form of hydrocarbon residues, he said. In the bad old days,
if you put a piston under a microscope, it would resemble a
mountain range. Each of those countless pits in the metal could be
the birthplace of junk that mucks up the air, the skylines and our
lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, the automakers _ fearing costly replacement
technology even as it experiments, under prodding, with alternative
power sources _ is making pistons so smooth there's no place for
the gas and its waste products to hide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought electric cars were the answer, but they're just the
bridesmaid again, though their net effect has been positive,''
Rentschler said. ``The industry got excited, like hornets get
excited, and put money into research. The outcome has been an
internal combustion engine that's incredibly competitive.''

TEXAS JOBS COULD BE LOST AS OIL GIANTS JOIN FORCES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM FUQUAY 
and ANDREW BACKOVER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ If the merger of oil giants Exxon and Mobil
is approved, North Texas will be home to the world's biggest
corporation. But the region might have to accept some job cuts
along with the distinction.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Mobil Corp. employs 2,300 at a production research
center in Farmers Branch and at a Dallas data center.
</P>
<P>
   But Exxon Corp., which is based in Irving's Las Colinas area,
also has a production research center. It's in Houston, the site of
Exxon's U.S. production headquarters and the designated home of the
merged company's world production and chemical operations.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives declined to speculate about where job cuts
are likely. In a joint statement issued Tuesday, Exxon and Mobil
said they expect to trim about 9,000 of their 123,000 worldwide
employees within three years. Analysts said many of those cuts are
likely to come from the office ranks, where administrative duties
would be duplicated.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts will come on top of about 30,000 job reductions at the
two companies in recent years, as fluctuating petroleum prices have
put the spotlight on cost-cutting. Crude oil prices have slipped 35
percent since January and more than 50 percent since January 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon has trimmed its U.S. payroll from more than 40,000
employees in 1991 to less than 30,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a general downsizing in the industry, and this
merger might accelerate that somewhat,'' said Ray Perryman, a Waco
economist and Southern Methodist University business professor.
</P>
<P>
   The merger could cost several thousand Texas jobs, he said. But
he and others said the state's economy should withstand those
losses, in contrast with the '80s, when an oil price collapse
sparked a near-depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oil used to be 25 percent of the state's gross product, and
now maybe it's 10 or 12 percent,'' Perryman said. ``We have a much
more diverse economy, and most industries do better with low oil
prices.''
</P>
<P>
   As crude oil prices have plunged this year, Texas has seen
employment in petroleum drilling and production fall 3,700, to
156,600 in October. In contrast, the state gained 8,200 of those
jobs last year.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon and Mobil both retain sizable payrolls in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Mobil employs 6,500 people in Texas, including 900 at its
refinery in Beaumont, said Don Turk, a spokesman at Mobil's
Fairfax, Va., headquarters. Mobil has more employees here than in
any other state, Turk said.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon employs 350 in Irving, 4,000 at its huge Baytown refinery
and another 8,500 at its U.S. production headquarters in Houston.
The company, which has other operations in Texas, was unable to
provide an estimate of statewide employment.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies also have significant production in Texas. Exxon
is the state's No. 2 crude oil producer and Mobil is No. 5,
according to Texas Railroad Commission figures.
</P>
<P>
   Oil production has traditionally driven an army of oilfield
service and equipment suppliers. One supplier said Tuesday that he
was worried that the Exxon-Mobil deal, and expected mergers to
come, will mean fewer customers for his business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary concern is that in the process of mergers and
acquisitions in the oil sector, there will be reduced capital
spending for equipment and services,'' said Dan Lowrance, president
of SPM Flow Control in White Settlement. ``I'm hearing it from
everybody. There's a real concern out there.''
</P>
<P>
   SPM sells flow control and plunger pumps to well-service
companies that serve oil producers.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry analysts speculated that Exxon and Mobil might
have to sell refineries in Texas, Louisiana and California, where
the future partners both have refineries. The two Texas refineries
are state-of-the-art facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The deal might also prompt the sale of some gasoline stations to
satisfy antitrust concerns. Mobil has an estimated 12 percent of
the U.S. gasoline market; Exxon has about 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   John Parry, an industry analyst for John S. Herold Inc. in
Connecticut, noted, for example, that both companies have a strong
retail presence in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if they had to dump half of it, it's not an issue,''
Parry said. ``We're talking about a $200 billion company.''
Divestitures shouldn't total more than several billion, he said.

URBAN SPRAWL: THE OTHER CONFLICT IN THE MIDDLE EAST 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ELAINE RUTH FLETCHER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Tucked into a handsome grove of trees on the West
Bank, in a pastoral landscape of rolling hills, the stone-hewn
World War I-era train station of Sebastiya is a wistful remnant of
an era when railroads crisscrossed a remote and undeveloped region
called Palestine and continued on to Damascus, Beirut, Cairo and
Amman.
</P>
<P>
   It was to Sebastiya that a group of Jewish settlers came in
1974, following the Yom Kippur War, to squat and demand government
permission to settle the northern West Bank. They chose Sebastiya
not only because it had been the capital of the ancient Kingdom of
Israel, but also because of its strategic value as a point at the
crossroads of routes leading from the Mediterranean coast inland to
the Samarian Hills, and from the Galilee to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The settlers campaign of the 1970s led to the creation of dozens
of settlements in the region, transforming Sebastiya into a
modern-day symbol of the Jewish movement to settle the Biblical
``Greater Land of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for the last two decades, the train station and groves of
trees have remained untouched, preserved as a park and historical
site.
</P>
<P>
   And so it was to this quiet site that another, younger
generation of settlers returned last week _ in a symbolic protest
against the Wye Plantation accord between Israel and the
Palestinians. Lugging heavy, hand-hewn rocks, the settlers began to
``renovate'' the old stone structure, saying that they wanted to
realize a long-term plan to turn it into a museum.
</P>
<P>
   There is a tremendous irony in the settlers' struggle to gain
control over this isolated train station and turn it into a museum.
It is an irony that would be lost on many politicians, but which
environmentalists might appreciate _ as well as any Jew, Christian
or Muslim who has drawn inspiration from images of the Biblical
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   While the Jewish settlement drive that began in places like
Sebastiya was founded on the principle of ``redeeming'' the ancient
and historic land of the Bible, today it is contributing to the
destruction of the very resource that the settlers claim to
cherish.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement experience was suckled on the archetypal images
of the Biblical and medieval contours of the land itself _ on the
images of ancient olive groves and shepherds' hills, and small
groves of trees drinking water from a tiny, underground spring, set
in the broader expanse of a barren, rocky field. And it is just
those features which are fast disappearing under the weight of Arab
and Jewish development _ both in pre-1967 Israel and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In this tiny region, Israel's annual population growth of 2.4
percent is the fastest in the developed world; the Arab population
of the West Bank and Gaza is growing even faster, about 3 percent
annually. By 2020, the combined area of Israel and the Palestinian
Authority will boast a population of about 12 million _ with
average population densities roughly equal to those of Los Angeles
or the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Add to the fact that some 70 percent of Israel is virtually
uninhabitable desert, the Negev, and you wind up with some of the
highest population densities in the world in Israel's central and
northern districts. The edges of the Israeli urban megalopolis _
extending from Lebanon almost to Gaza _ are creeping steadily
inland and are today only miles away from the borders of the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Settlers have argued that Israel's small size makes it
imperative for the Jewish state to gain control of as much West
Bank land as possible as an environmental ``escape valve'' for the
crowded coastline. Yet such a view not only ignores the growth
needs of the Palestinians, it misrepresents the true development
pattern of the settlements themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The West Bank's 144 settlements average only about 1,200
residents each. Most settlements, built of one- and two-story
garden homes capped with red-tiled roofs, are the Middle Eastern
equivalent of American-style suburban or exurban growth. As such,
they represent a development pattern that guzzles the land, rather
than ``redeeming'' it, and is wholly unsustainable in a region
where land is scarce and populations are soaring.
</P>
<P>
   The settlements are too small and dispersed to be hooked to any
public transportation grid, so transportation to and from them is
largely by automobile. In the lingo of urban planners, the
settlements are massive ``trip generators'' _ since most work,
educational and shopping needs cannot be met within these small,
isolated enclaves.
</P>
<P>
   Left to grow on their own, these settlements would generate
increasing levels of traffic and pollution, and ever-increasing
demands for new roads on the West Bank's landscape of ancient olive
groves, shepherds' hills and valleys of lush but tiny,
stone-bordered fields.
</P>
<P>
   Stand on the edge of many Jewish settlements in the West Bank
highlands at night and you can see the process under way; the
lights of central Israel are increasingly close as the carpet of
continuous urban development creeps up from the Israeli coast into
the West Bank foothills. From another direction, you can see the
expanding halo of West Bank Palestinian cities such as Ramallah,
Bethlehem and Hebron.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the passionate talk from both Jews and Arabs about the
sacredness of the land, this is still an era when land is
essentially not sacred soil, but a political commodity to be
exploited, sometimes ruthlessly. Until now, Israelis have had that
dubious privilege. But Palestinians have generated their own forms
of sprawl, paying little attention to how unfettered and unplanned
growth might consume the very soil that they profess to adore.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Project out the region's growth rates by only a few decades and
don't be surprised if the ancient Biblical landscape disappears
almost entirely, giving way to more and more suburbs, superstores
and shopping malls.
</P>
<P>
   There will be the Middle East franchises of carpet outlets and
burger joints, some built on ``liberated'' Palestinian lands by
entrepreneurs like those who created the new Jericho Casino _ whose
squat, square profile surrounded by parking lots already looks like
a giant shopping mall rising out of the desert.
</P>
<P>
   And there will be more and more roads _ roads built to link
isolated Jewish outposts and roads built as highways to bypass
other crowded local roads, roads that are tied up in enormous
traffic jams of both Israelis and Palestinians at rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than building a museum to settlement at Sebastiya's train
station, the settlers would do well to redirect their boundless
energies, money and political clout into the rebuilding of the rail
station itself. And then they should insist that all future
development be in the form of compact, pedestrian-scale cities with
strict controls on surrounding green spaces, linked to a larger
regional development grid by an ultramodern rail system.
</P>
<P>
   As they stand today, the settlements are not only an obstacle to
the effort to draw a political ``boundary'' between Israel and the
Palestinians, they are part of the bloodletting of the land itself.
The sooner permanent political boundaries are fixed, the sooner
Israelis and Palestinians will begin to assess the limits of their
resources and think about conservation, rather than endless
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the old train station in the grove of trees called
Sebastiya is indeed destined to become a museum piece _ an
anachronistic remnant of life in the Holy Land before most of it
was buried under asphalt.

EXXON COMPLEX IN IRVING, TEXAS, CAN ABSORB MORE WORKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MILES MOFFEIT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ It's almost as if a megamerger were in the
blueprints four years ago when Exxon built its headquarters
complex, which dominates the horizon west of Las Colinas' pink
granite towers.
</P>
<P>
   The 360,000-square-foot complex can accommodate hundreds of
additional workers who could be shifted as a result of the
Exxon-Mobil merger, according to real estate observers and local
chamber officials.
</P>
<P>
   And if they can't be squeezed into the main office, which
already houses about 300 employees, the company also has 30 acres
on which it can build nearby.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Exxon and Mobil officials said they would base their
new company's headquarters at the north Irving site, but they
declined to specify what the future holds for staffing.
</P>
<P>
   Economic development officials are betting on a sizable boost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, with any merger, the headquarters end up with more
employees,'' said James Spriggs, president of the Greater
Irving-Las Colinas Chamber of Commerce. ``They have a very large
facility, with ample room to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Spriggs described the Irving site as a natural and said chamber
officials will be working closely with the oil giant to help
relocated workers find homes near the headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just makes a lot of sense for them to be in Irving, since
Mobil has its largest refinery in Beaumont and it's close to
Exxon's major refinery,'' Spriggs said. ``We're kind of a unique
centerpiece of the world right here by D/FW Airport.''
</P>
<P>
   Exxon built its 3-story headquarters, appraised at about $40
million, after relocating from New York in the early '90s. The
sprawling facility hugs the skyline along Las Colinas Boulevard
about a mile west of the tower-packed Urban Center.
</P>
<P>
   The complex has been viewed as an office prototype by many
corporations shunning bustling urban centers for wooded suburban
settings.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Exxon added 30 acres to the complex, triggering
speculation that it might relocate another division to the site,
but Exxon officials termed it a ``buffer zone,'' saying no moves
were under way.
</P>
<P>
   A small portion of the complex extends into Las Colinas' utility
district, but district officials say Exxon has not disclosed any
plans for an expansion.

THE MET'S EXHIBIT OF FLEMISH PAINTINGS IS ART IN ITSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID BONETTI  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Large, comprehensive museums like the Metropolitan
Museum contain within them holdings that could form independent
museums of their own. The richness of the Met's collection in one
crucial area of Western art is made vividly clear in ``From Van
Eyck to Bruegel: Early Netherlandish Painting in the Metropolitan
Museum of Art.''
</P>
<P>
   Drawn almost exclusively from the Met's own holdings of 15th-
and 16th-century Flemish painting, the exhibition, which continues
through Jan. 3, traces the medium's development from the invention
of oil painting, most likely by Jan van Eyck circa 1420, to its
thorough secularization under the hands of Pieter Bruegel the Elder
nearly 150 years later.
</P>
<P>
   The Met possesses the largest and most comprehensive collection
of such painting in the Western Hemisphere. Indeed, you would have
to go to Berlin or Madrid to see its better under one roof. But
until now you couldn't see all the Met's early Flemish paintings in
one place.
</P>
<P>
   For various reasons, its Flemish painting was hung in three
different areas of the Fifth Avenue building; other works were
installed at the Cloisters, the Met's re-creation of a medieval
monastery high above the Hudson River in Washington Heights.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, all the Met's major Flemish paintings,
joined by lesser works kept in storage, have been brought together.
(A few choice works, panels from the same altar piece that had been
separated, for instance, have been borrowed from other
institutions.) This is the opportunity of a lifetime for lovers of
Early Netherlandish art to see so much of the astonishing painting
that captures the way the world looks, as if by magic.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, which includes more than 140 works, proceeds
chronologically and thematically. Sections on portraiture, studio
workshop practice, the influence of Italian painting and a
show-within-a-show of paintings by Gerard David (1455-1523)
punctuate its flow.
</P>
<P>
   The inclusion of paintings usually kept in storage pays off in
the section devoted to the busy Flemish workshops, where a wall of
small, devotional pictures treating Mary breast-feeding Christ
reveals in one sweep the variations possible within a strictly
codified theme.
</P>
<P>
   The show opens with a bang. Its first gallery, devoted to
religious painting, contains two of the Met's greatest paintings
from any time and place, van Eyck's Crucifixion and Last Judgment
diptych, and Robert Campin's Annunciation triptych, both dating
from circa 1430.
</P>
<P>
   Van Eyck's Crucifixion still astonishes with its microscopic
observation. The tall, narrow panel, only 22 by 8 inches, is packed
with activity organized vertically into three zones. The viewer
looks at the scene from a position that makes him look up toward
the crucifixion itself and down at the group of mourners in the
foreground. The painting is suffused with spiritual feeling. In no
other religious art are we so aware of the spiritual made flesh as
in Flemish painting.
</P>
<P>
   The bodily sacrifice of God's son that van Eyck and his
contemporaries believed saved mankind from eternal damnation
dominates the scene. The three crosses bearing Christ and the two
thieves rising above the crowd are outlined against the sky, but
our attention is riveted not by Christ's anguish but by that of the
suffering of his mother and his disciples in the foreground,
separated from the foot of the cross by a densely packed band of
individualized Roman soldiers and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Mary, wrapped in her blue robe as in a protective cocoon, and
Mary Magdalen, her long red hair flowing freely over her green
robe, her hands joined together in prayer, are, between them, the
very emblems of grief.
</P>
<P>
   Campin's Annunciation is the earliest that survives that shows
the moment when Mary is impregnated by the holy spirit in a
domestic setting, and it is painted with an eye-cleansing clarity.
Looking at these early oil paintings, you can understand why
Italian artists flipped when they first saw them, adopting the new
technique as fast as they could learn how to use it.
</P>
<P>
   This triptych, a high-priced and much-discussed object when
purchased by the Met in 1956, has offered generations of art
historians the opportunity to weigh in on the nature of symbolism
in Flemish art, and it is easy to see that each object in this
bourgeois interior, the just-extinguished candle, the open book,
the majolica vase holding a lily, the white towel hanging from the
rack, was carefully chosen by the artist _ whatever his intention.
</P>
<P>
   The show contains several other annunciations, none quite as
brilliant as this, although one, by Hans Memling, in which the
Virgin is held up by two angels, is particularly charming. Its
theme, the idea that spirit is made flesh in the body of Christ, is
one that is particularly resonant in Flemish art, so spiritual and
so worldly at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition is demanding on the eye, and repeated visits are
necessary to do it justice. In a show in which religious painting
dominates, the two galleries devoted to portraiture are sure to be
popular, even though many of them were cut down from larger
compositions, often of a religious nature. The verisimilitude of
Flemish portraiture has never been surpassed, and the sitters'
wrinkles, warts and beard stubble are all lovingly detailed.
</P>
<P>
   Although even the most religious of Flemish painting abounds
with details of physical reality, a whole new world is suggested in
Bruegel's ``The Harvesters'' (1565), the masterpiece that closes
the show. One of six compositions on the theme of the seasons, this
famous painting shows peasants lunching on a brief break from
harvesting wheat.
</P>
<P>
   Absorbed in their food and in their work, they nevertheless
inhabit a world that is complete in itself. In the distance, the
landscape extends through green fields and a village and another
golden field of grain to a harbor where the hazy atmosphere
suggests the globe's curvature and a distant world to be explored.
God is present here only by implication, and if you choose not to
see him, you don't have to.

THESE CHEFS MAKE EATING AT HOME MORE CONVENIENT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   JOHNSONVILLE, N.Y. _ Barbara Ford missed cooking. She had worked
at a restaurant in the Berkshire Mountains for almost 10 years.
Devoted customers were her source of personal satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   But she had to give up the restaurant job four years ago when
she had her second child and the family moved to Johnsonville, N.Y.
A culinary career was on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Then Ford learned about the United States Personal Chef
Association, an Albuquerque, N.M.-based organization that helps
cooking-minded men and women set up their own businesses making
meals for busy families who desire to dine at home but don't have
the time to prepare dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, who earlier this year named her chef service Dinner's
Done, now has a half-dozen regular clients. She develops a one- or
two-week menu plan for each, based on their nutritional needs and
individual preferences, buys the necessary groceries and makes all
of the meals during a daylong cooking marathon in the customer's
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more fun than being a restaurant cook. I love to
cook,'' Ford said. ``This is a challenge to get it done and hope
people enjoy it. You set your own pace and each client is
different, so you're cooking different foods off a menu you put
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford charges between $200 and $250 for a week's worth of
dinners, including the cost of the groceries. She also provides
instructions for each meal, letting the family know when it should
be removed from the freezer and how much reheating time is
required.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the service,'' said LeeLee Nielsen, an owner of Grafton
Mountain Modular Homes in nearby Valley Falls who has been using
Dinner's Done for the past six months. ``The main reason I did it
was for convenience and so everybody was home for supper instead of
going out in six different places.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put the meal in and put the timer on and when you get home
at six it's ready for you. All you have to do is make a salad.
Plus, she accommodates you. My kids don't like onions, so Barbara
omits onions. The only way we can tell she has been here making
dinners is that the kitchen is spotless, cleaner than we left it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dinner's Done gives Ford almost complete control over her
schedule, allowing her to be home when her two boys get home from
school. Her biggest hurdle has been expanding the client base. But
most of her customers learn about her business by word of mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Sanchez is dealing with the same problem. The Delmar,
N.Y.-based personal chef named his business The Secret Ingredient
when he joined the USPCA in June, and he has found that
self-promotion is considerably more difficult than making two
week's worth of tasty dinners in a single day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to get the word out,'' said Sanchez, who has set up
a Website for his business (www.thesecret-ingredient.com). ``The
business is growing steadily, just not as quickly as I would
prefer.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez, 34, has what seems to be the ideal resume. He went
through the hotel and restaurant school at Rochester Institute of
Technology and attended the prestigious Culinary Institute of
America in Hyde Park, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   With his food and business acumen, Sanchez developed a
good-paying career as a district manager for a company that manages
corporate dining rooms. But he found that too much of his time was
spent on paperwork and too little of it in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Then Sanchez discovered the USPCA, which charges a minimum
annual membership of $49 for a variety of services (start-up
information, training manual, regulatory guidelines, how to obtain
the proper income tax status, recipe library, etc.), and he decided
to go into business for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing well but I'm not making the same kind of money as I
was,'' he said. ``The thing is, I love being a chef and I didn't
always love being a district manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been this personally satisfied doing anything for a
living ever. That outweighs everything. It was my primary goal.
It's allowed things to grow in my marriage and my relationship with
my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez charges $275 for a standard two-week service for two
people, and his introductory offer includes a $50 saving.
</P>
<P>
   David MacKay, executive director of the USPCA, founded the
service in 1991. About 11 years ago, MacKay said he ``created a
concept'' to get his wife, Susan, out of the hectic restaurant
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Hey, if the yuppies are paying to have maids come
in to their house, they'll pay to have personal chefs come in,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay started the association with five members. Today, there
are conventions, training sessions, correspondence courses,
certification and a bimonthly magazine. At the present growth rate
there will be more than 5,000 personal chef services in the United
States in five years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez said personal chefs make financial sense for families
who either don't have the time or the disposition to cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people find out that my charge for a typical, two-week
service for two people ends up being quite economical compared to
eating out for two weeks,'' he said.

 &HT;    MacNeil and Lehrer publish two books simultaneously
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MacNeil and Lehrer are together again, this time on bookshelves
rather than on television. For almost 15 years, Robert MacNeil and
Jim Lehrer co-anchored PBS's hourlong evening newscast. MacNeil
left in 1996, primarily to write, and Lehrer soldiers on alone.
These two genteel journalists have published new novels
simultaneously, and while neither is going to prompt Updike or Roth
to check his heels to see who's nipping there, both are brisk,
engaging reads.
</P>
<P>
   MacNeil sets ``Breaking News'' close to the milieu he's most
familiar with: a network newscast. But whereas PBS's ``NewsHour''
is somewhat immune to ratings pressure, MacNeil's fictional
newscast is on a commercial network, an amalgam of NBC, CBS and
ABC, the better to deal in conflicts and current issues.
</P>
<P>
   And his hero, aging anchor Grant Munro, is a composite of Tom
Brokaw, Dan Rather and Peter Jennings. Munro is a hold-out for
old-fashioned news standards, battling day to day on a win-some,
lose-some basis against ratings-obsessed producers and
bottom-line-obsessed corporate chieftains. Munro is smart enough to
see where his business is going (toward the predatory Ann Murrow, a
younger Diane Sawyer-Barbara Walters-Connie Chung knock-off), and
vain enough to wonder whether a facelift will solve all his
problems.
</P>
<P>
   MacNeil's best creation is Hollygo Lightly, the ``first
electronic black drag queen gossip columnist,'' whose Internet site
dishes deliciously on the TV news business. If you can't imagine an
unholy cross between Matt Drudge and the Lady Chablis from
``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,'' MacNeil can, and
Hollygo makes ``Breaking News'' feel delightfully in the know.
</P>
<P>
   Lehrer's ``Purple Dots'' is a lightweight espionage thriller;
but lightweight in the same positive sense as William F. Buckley's
Blackford Oakes books. The title refers to secret marks on license
plates used by CIA agents, and has nothing to do with the main
plot, about dealings and double-dealings over the confirmation of a
nominee to head the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   Lehrer's hero is Charles Henderson, a retired spook who runs a
bed-and-breakfast inn in West Virginia and who digs out his old
secret decoder ring to help his friend, the nominee. There's never
any sense that the fate of the free world depends on what happens,
but Lehrer makes us like Hamilton enough that we care whether or
not he succeeds.

NEW BRIDGE PROMISES LESS GRIDLOCK FOR BORDER COMMERCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID HENDRICKS  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ Locals call it the ``fourth bridge.''
Construction bidders call it the Laredo Northwest International
Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what it is called, the $101 million span promises to
relieve some of the gridlock created by the booming cross-border
commerce that has turned this Texas city into a major commercial
port.
</P>
<P>
   One of the nation's fastest growing cities, Laredo has become a
gateway for truck traffic hauling goods north and south _ a result
of the vast common market created by Canada, Mexico and the United
States under the North American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Construction on the bridge that spans the Rio Grande began
earlier this year. It is expected to open in March 2000.
</P>
<P>
   It will be used for commercial truck traffic only, setting aside
the two oldest bridges connecting downtown Laredo to downtown Nuevo
Laredo, Mexico, for passenger traffic.
</P>
<P>
   And a connecting road will have areas for up to 300 trucks to
queue while waiting border checks, helping avoid the long lines
that form every afternoon on Interstate 35.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a lot better,'' said Laredo Transportation
Association President Tom Wade. ``It means no more trucks (backing
up) on Interstate 35, just local delivery. It will be a big break
for the Laredo driving public.''
</P>
<P>
   The addition of a new bridge probably will speed up northbound
freight to U.S. and Canadian destinations. But it might not make
southbound freight arrive earlier in Mexico because of red-tape
that snarls traffic at the checkpoint south of Nuevo Laredo.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of improvement is needed there, too, to speed up the
trucks, to be as fast as the new bridge,'' said Alejandro Pardo,
sales manager of Dicex International Inc., a Monterrey,
Mexico-based customs broker.
</P>
<P>
   The new bridge will be positioned between two older downtown
bridges and the relatively new Solidarity Bridge that was dedicated
in 1991. The Solidarity Bridge is about 20 miles upriver from
downtown Laredo and was spearheaded by the industrial state of
Nuevo Leon.
</P>
<P>
   But the Solidarity Bridge failed to reduce the high truck demand
for one of the older bridges because connecting roads to the main
highways in Texas and Mexico have not been completed. Construction
began recently on a 20-mile toll road from the Solidarity to I-35.
</P>

   ``The fourth bridge is the one we've really wanted all along,''
said Florencio Pena III, the city manager of Laredo, a city of
188,000 people. ``It will take care of our urban problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico will pay up to $30 million for the new bridge. The U.S.
share will be paid by the Texas Department of Transportation, the
city of Laredo and bridge revenues.

MERGER ANNOUNCEMENT TAKES GAS STATION OWNERS BY SURPRISE
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ It's a long way from the Mobil Corp.
boardroom to Dennis Heiser's Mobil station on Loop 820 in North
Richland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Heiser has run the dealership for 23 years and has long enjoyed
a companionable relationship with the owner of the Exxon across the
street.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after Exxon and Mobil's megamerger, the Exxon station on
the opposite corner will be a brother business to Heiser's Mobil
station. What that means for dealers and consumers remains in
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all at a kind of a loss,'' Heiser said Tuesday.
``Usually, they tell us about something before it hits the papers.
But this came as a slap in the face.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies said that they will retain both brands at the
retail level. But regulators and consumers will be watching for
signs that the loss of competition hurts consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think many times it's better for the consumer to have more
brands and more competitors,'' said Lynton Allred, executive vice
president of the Austin-based Texas Petroleum Marketers and
Convenience Store Association. ``I think it might hurt consumers in
the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   The combined company will control almost 20 percent of the Texas
retail gasoline market. Exxon is the dominant player in the state,
with about 14 percent of the retail gasoline market, compared with
Mobil's 5 percent, according to Trilby Lundberg, a California-based
consumer research company.
</P>
<P>
   Mobil has recently shifted its retail presence in the state. In
October, it entered a venture with San Antonio-based Tetco to
operate its 145 Metroplex stations. Mobil retained a 49 percent
stake in local stores. In return, Tetco's 173 stores across the
state will sell Mobil products exclusively.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon has a stronger retail presence with hundreds of
company-owned outlets in Texas, which account for 30 percent of its
sales in the state. The remaining 70 percent of the sales are
handled by independent operators and convenience stores.
</P>
<P>
   The question for Allred and his association members is the same
for consumers: Will any of the company's estimated annual savings
of $2.15 billion to $3 billion mean lower gasoline prices?
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have said supply and demand play the key role in
dictating prices. And they noted that any corporate savings may
flow to the bottom line, boosting profits and perhaps stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   But as Allred says, ``If you can cut that much in operational
costs, someone is going to benefit.''

<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ It is Worcester on a very good day _ a cluster
of glass-and-chrome towers ringed by sturdy suburbs and red-brick
neighborhoods where hope has taken tenacious root.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's capital is no Boston. Next to New York, it's a
hamlet. It's the milepost in between, and suddenly, it no longer
seems to care.
</P>
<P>
   Hartford has heard your gray-flannel jokes about its
buttoned-down obsession with actuarial tables and its too-earnest
interest in the difference between term and whole life insurance
policies.
</P>
<P>
   And these days _ these Patriots-are-coming giddy days _ Hartford
finally has the self-assurance to chuckle right along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we have a chance to redefine ourselves,'' Republican
Governor John Rowland said, announcing the tentative deal to
redirect New England's professional football franchise from Route 1
in Foxborough to the nexus of Interstates 84 and 91 here.
</P>
<P>
   The TV cameras caught predictable euphoria of beer-guzzling fans
in the downtown sports barrooms. But in the dark-paneled
boardrooms, the linen-cloth dining rooms, and the just-folks living
rooms where this city really lives and breathes, the reaction was
different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' this city seems to be saying to itself, nodding
confidently. ``Finally, Hartford is ready for this.''
</P>
<P>
   It's got shock-jock Howard Stern on the radio, over-caffeinated
anchors on its morning TV broadcasts, a stately City Hall worthy of
a Hollywood back lot, and enough buses on Main Street to make
Greyhound proud.
</P>
<P>
   It's got its own symphony orchestra, a stubby skyline, a
struggling ballet company, a world-class art museum,
over-in-a-flash rush hours, and a public school system desperately
in need of rescue.
</P>
<P>
   New England's sixth-largest city (after Boston, Worcester,
Providence, Springfield, and Bridgeport, Conn.) is an
18-square-mile postage stamp that sits in one of the wealthiest
regions in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always looked out windows like this and knew that this
is really a small town,'' said Lewis B. Rome, a former state
senator and gubernatorial candidate and now a downtown mover and
shaker, from his office overlooking the proposed downtown stadium
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're so dramatically located between Boston and New York,
that we should be one of the most successful little towns in the
country. We're sleepy, yes. But we're sophisticated, too.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that combination that attracts people like Chuck DeLeo, 63,
a Framingham, Mass. native who has no intention of moving away from
a place where the state's governor was once asked to surrender his
seat at a restaurant because it belonged to a regular with dibs on
it for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hartford isn't as complicated as Boston, but it still has that
cosmopolitan flair,'' said DeLeo, a retired teacher and coach who
moved to Hartford 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a small enough city that you know almost everybody. In a
big city like Boston you can be lonely. It's hard being lonely in
Hartford.''
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Smith, 64, likes those rhythms, too.
</P>
<P>
   A genial retiree with a pencil-thin mustache and just a trace of
the silky accent of his native North Carolina, Smith headed north
after World War II in search of jobs, stopping briefly in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hartford was more my speed,'' Smith said over an
egg-and-homefries breakfast at Mo's Midtown, a tiny West End diner.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, Smith's Hartford wore overalls, not pin-striped
suits. It was a place where you could get a factory job. And if you
didn't like it, you could choose another.
</P>
<P>
   Smith worked at the old Hartford Sugar Co. on Windsor Street as
a supply clerk before leaving for a similar job at the Royal
Typewriter Co. The Cold War was in its deepest frost and
Connecticut, maker of Revolutionary War cannons and Civil War
gunpowder, was humming along again on Pentagon dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was booming in those days,'' said Smith, who
ultimately decided to go into business for himself, running a
service station and later a package store, and raised six children
who all went to Hartford's public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't having the problems with the schools then that
they're having now,'' Smith said, noting Hartford Public High
School's recent threatened loss of its accreditation.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's children include a bank supervisor, a fitness
instructor, a school librarian, and a state employee. ``I lost one
to the streets,'' he said of a son serving a prison term in
Enfield. ``He wound up with a drug problem, but he's doing fine now
and I'm proud of the progress he's making.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith is proud of his city, too. He's a church deacon and a
member of the men's choir who sings Hartford's praises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Hartford is one of the best cities in the country,''
he said. ``The streets are pretty safe. All big cities have
problems and we have our share, but I think drug use is on the
decline.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith holds no illusions that an NFL franchise can remake the
city. ``For the people in the neighborhoods, their box seat is
going to be where it is right now: in front of the TV set. We have
some of the richest people in the state and some of the poorest
people in the state.

INDEPENDENTS TO PICK UP PIECES BIG OIL LEAVES BEHIND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAN PILLER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The Exxon-Mobil deal is all about Big Oil,
and that makes it a big deal in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But Little Oil is standing by to pick up the leftovers, and
that, too, is a big deal in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the huge, integrated multinationals such as Exxon
and Mobil have been doing a long, slow retreat from Texas and the
U.S. midcontinent over the past two decades in favor of new plays
in the former Soviet Union, China and Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   They have been replaced, at least in some fields, by small
independents. And those independents lucky enough to have some
spare cash may find some opportunities from the leavings of Exxon
and Mobil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exxon and Mobil aren't merging because they can get synergies
in the Permian Basin of Texas,'' said Jon Brumley, a veteran Fort
Worth-based independent oilman. ``They're after new opportunities
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will create opportunities for those who are looking for
assets in Texas,'' added Brumley, whose Encore Acquisition
Partners, formed this year, is looking for such properties.
</P>
<P>
   In retreating, Big Oil has sharply cut its share of Texas
production.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, according to Texas Railroad Commission figures, about 1
billion barrels of oil were produced in Texas. Of that, Exxon
accounted for 223.6 million barrels and Mobil, 48.6 million
barrels.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, Texas' production had dropped to 495.5 million barrels.
Exxon's share was only 29.2 million barrels, while Mobil produced
18.9 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think how big this merger would have been under the numbers of
20 years ago,'' said David Garlick of the Texas Independent Royalty
Owners Association, the trade group of Texas' independent energy
operators.
</P>
<P>
   Low crude oil and natural gas prices have accelerated the trend
of property sales in Texas in 1998, with big auctions held in
Houston, Midland and Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   But those low crude prices have cut into the cash flow of energy
producers, which in turn reduces the ability of independents who
can't afford to be patient to take advantage of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   John Pinkerton, chairman of Fort Worth-based Range Resources,
said the opportunities Big Oil leaves behind ``may not mean much to
operators who can't generate profits and favorable cash flow when
oil is selling effectively for $10 a barrel and natural gas prices
have dropped below $2 per thousand cubic feet.''
</P>
<P>
   And Pinkerton and Brumley both said that low oil and gas prices
are here to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``This merger tells me that prices are going to stay low for a
while, as best anyone can tell,'' Brumley said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Elyea of Wichita Falls, president of the North Texas Oil &AMP;
Gas Association, noted that so-called ``stripper wells,'' those
producing 15 barrels of oil or less per day, are likely to be
capped during the next year because they are no longer profitable.
Once capped, he said, those wells are unlikely to be reopened.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. domestic oil production stood at 8.6 million barrels per
day in 1986, and now is 6.2 million barrels,'' Elyea said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another big problem is that the industry has lost a lot of
talent,'' Elyea added. ``There are thousands of engineers,
geologists and other well-trained people who have simply drifted
away from the energy industry. We'll never get them back.''

TWO LEADERS WILL MOLD EXXON MOBIL'S CULTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MITCHELL SCHNURMAN+ c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On paper, they seem so similar. In the flesh, they seem very
different.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Raymond and Lucio Noto, the chief executives of Exxon and
Mobil, respectively, joined their companies in the early 1960s
within a year of each other.
</P>
<P>
   They spent time working abroad and then, after displaying
financial skills, climbed through the ranks at home.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 30 years after joining their organizations, each was
named chairman and chief executive _ again, within 12 months of
each other.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with both at age 60 and with the oil industry in the throes
of extensive consolidation, the paths of Raymond and Noto have
converged, with the agreement to combine their companies in the
biggest merger in history.
</P>
<P>
   As with most mergers, there are concerns over how the two
corporate cultures will mesh. And the two executives will set the
tone.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond, a native of South Dakota, has been described as a
bookish, stern headmaster who disdains publicity and has built a
company known for its financial discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Noto, a Brooklyn native, is more talkative and seems to enjoy
bantering with reporters. His company is considered more
freewheeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their behavior is going to be the example for every Exxon and
Mobil employee in the world,'' said Allen Mesch, director of the
Maguire Oil &AMP; Gas Institute at Southern Methodist University in
Dallas. ``They may not go on long vacations together, but they
better demonstrate more than professional etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're essentially engaged. And engagements can break up over
some pretty small things.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the prospect of their combination prompted The Wall
Street Journal to say this week that it would be like mixing oil
and water. And the mergers-and-acquisitions landscape is littered
with corporate-suite casualties. Some huge deals were even scrapped
because top executives clashed over how to share power.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, BankAmerica President David Coulter resigned amid
reports of conflicts with Hugh McColl, whose NationsBank led the
merger of the financial insitutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a great majority of cases, the No. 2 guy leaves within a
year,'' said Chuck Becker, associate professor of finance at Texas
Christian University in Fort Worth. ``Sometimes people never find a
way to march to the same drummer. And that can extend down through
all the ranks.''
</P>
<P>
   Noto said that won't be an issue at Exxon Mobil because the
leadership is clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to work for Lee,'' Noto said Tuesday at a news
conference in New York. ``I've spent 36 years with Mobil, and
believe it or not, for 32 of those years I actually worked for
people, as opposed to shareholders. And I think I can adapt myself
to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   They have agreed to share power in a way that seems
proportionate to the deal, which calls for Exxon shareholders to
retain a 70 percent stake in the combined company.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond will be chairman, CEO and president. Noto will be vice
chairman of a 19-member board that will include six Mobil
directors.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond and Noto have both been lauded for their willingness to
slash costs and boost performance. In the '90s, they have both cut
thousands of jobs and jettisoned poor-performing properties.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond, who holds a doctorate in chemical engineering from the
University of Minnesota, pushed for stock buybacks when many other
oil companies were investing in risky projects that later failed.
</P>
<P>
   He has been praised for producing the best returns in the energy
business, and he has steadily reduced Exxon's costs, pushing
profits and stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond made clear yesterday that the combined company will
impose the same tough financial discipline on the new operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exxon has set the pace'' for return on capital, Raymond said,
and the company will have ``a relentless commitment to being the
most efficient competitor in each business segment.''
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks yesterday, Raymond was usually short and to the
point, with little flourish. Noto, by contrast, came across as more
conversational.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter asked for more details about plans to reduce the
work force and sell properties, Raymond said it was premature to
speculate on specifics, adding that legal advisers had told him not
to make any comments until Exxon met with regulators.
</P>
<P>
   A Houston reporter followed up by asking why Exxon was not
offering its own proposal to the Federal Trade Commission, rather
than waiting on the government reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be candid about it,'' Raymond said, ``I'm not interested in
your views on how we should deal with the FTC.''
</P>
<P>
   A few moments later, Raymond was asked about his profit
projections and, after challenging the reporter's assumption about
a company chart, he took another dig.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not very confident about predicting oil prices,'' Raymond
said, ``which is why I like to come to these meetings. So you can
tell me.''
</P>
<P>
   Noto, who has a master's in business administration from Cornell
University, lightened the mood when he was asked about working with
Raymond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Lee and I have a good equation, notwithstanding all
the stuff that's been written about us,'' Noto said. ``We'll do a
bear act if you'll give us a moment.''

 HARTFORD, Conn.: ... in the state.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``They say their first game will be in the fall of 2001. They're
giving us plenty of time,'' he said, breaking into a sly smile. ``I
should be able to save up money for a ticket by then.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes people have to remind Ellen Nurse that the city of
Hartford issues her paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bus system stinks. The police department is terrible. The
school system stinks,'' said Nurse, 51, her hand gestures sending
cigarette smoke in wild patterns over a soup-and-sandwich lunch at
a downtown tavern.
</P>
<P>
   Nurse also makes it clear that Hartford is like her family. If
you're a member, you can criticize it. If you're not, it's best
that you keep your opinions to yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Hartford has its own unique personality,'' said Nurse,
an information services city employee. ``This is a Yankee city.
People say it takes a long time to fit into a clique here. When you
walk down the streets in Hartford, people may say hi to you, or
they may not. They've got to check you out first.''
</P>
<P>
   Nurse has been parading the streets of this city all her life.
She's one of the city's seven constables and, because she owns no
car, serves her official papers by riding the bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, the city's not but 18 square miles,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   And she knows every block. Nurse knew Hartford before the
downtown department stores abandoned Main Street for the tony
shopping malls of the city's swankier suburbs. She recalls a jumble
of downtown movie theaters whose prerequisite for entry was
attendance that week at Sunday school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of fun and we looked out after each other in
those days,'' said Nurse. ``And we got a good education, too. Now,
we have some good teachers, but we've got far too many who don't
give a damn.''
</P>
<P>
   Nurse said Hartford needs to move beyond a hurtful political
mentality in which the city is balkanized by race or by the
ethnicities of its neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem here is that we still too often talk North End
versus South End, black and white and Hispanic,'' she said. ``We
need to put that in our past. I tell people there's nothing wrong
with this city that we can't fix. ... The thing that kills Hartford
is that nobody lives downtown.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, said Nurse, is something that the Patriots won't
affect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who are going to benefit are the people on the
outskirts of Hartford,'' said Nurse. ``People in my neighborhood
are not going to have access to tickets. You cannot come out and
enjoy a game if you don't have a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Nurse's no-nonsense criticism of her hometown softens when she's
asked how she would describe the place to a stranger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hartford? This is a good city. Actually, a small New England
village is what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   If all of the cliched adjectives about this city _ staid,
conservative, dull, pedestrian _ were accurate, Mike Peters could
never say this: ``How ya doin'. I'm the mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   Peters, or Mayor Mike, as he is universally known, is not your
father's chief executive. A former career firefighter whose own
family mocked him when he announced in 1993 that he was running for
mayor, Peters was reelected to a third term last year with 90
percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   A five-hour tour of his town last week, in which hizzoner drove
a reporter through neighborhood after neighborhood and held court
over beer and sausages, was equal parts civic promotion, hometown
history lesson, and Vegas lounge act.
</P>
<P>
   Judging Hartford by its shiny central-city office buildings
would be like judging Boston by the Hancock tower. And Peters, a
Marlboro-smoking, Budweiser-drinking man, doesn't want anyone to
take that one-dimensional measure of his city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come for a ride,'' Peters said, throwing his blue Buick into
drive, ``and I'll show you a city on the move.''
</P>
<P>
   Peters never went to college, says he couldn't run for high
office because he did inhale, and laces his language with
profanities that roll off his tongue like prepositions.
</P>
<P>
   But in rapid-fire delivery, the man gets his message across. The
city's crime rate is down 35 percent in the past five years. The
vacancy rate in offices downtown _ once at 27 percent _ now hovers
around 10 percent. The streets are clean. The parks are groomed.
Graffiti doesn't last long.
</P>
<P>
   As he drives (``If I had a driver, then two of us would know
where I was''), cops, bus drivers, house painters, and teenagers
shout to him as if he were a folk hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel better about this city than they did before,'' he
said, cruising through the Blue Hill sections of North Hartford.
``We've lowered taxes four years in a row. We've got people moving
back to the city. We've done more studies than any other city and
now we're just saying, `(Expletive) it. Let's just do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Even his critics don't deny that Peters is in love with his
hometown. He lives six blocks from where he grew up.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father worked for the state, and when he died, he left me a
pair of pants,'' he said. ``But they didn't fit and the wallet was
missing.''
</P>
<P>
   The city is tearing down Dickensian housing projects, working to
redevelop dilapidated housing and boarded-up three-deckers, and
reclaiming its waterfront on the Connecticut River.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to meet the guy who decided to build this highway right
next to the river so I can punch him right in the head,'' Peters
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been out there every day for the past five years, telling
people that Hartford is a great city with a lot of promise,'' he
said. ``Finally, it's paying off.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, census figures showed that Hartford was the
nation's fastest-diminishing city, but officials think they have
stanched the decline. The population, at 139,739 in 1990, is
projected to be 131,640 by 2000 and 145,580 by 2020.
</P>
<P>
   As Puerto Ricans and West Indians retrace the steps of their
Irish, Italian, and Eastern European immigrant predecessors,
Hartford appears perfectly at ease with its municipal station in
life. If the sidewalks roll up at 5 p.m., so be it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a transplant from New York, and there's no hustle and
bustle here like there is there,'' said Stafford Chisholm, 34, an
insurance account executive. ``When I used to visit my old friends
in New York, they used to tease me about going back to the `woods'
in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as I get older, I appreciate that more and more.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas D. Ritter, retiring this year after serving the longest
tenure as speaker of the Connecticut Legislature, said the Patriots
deal is more important to him for what it symbolizes than for the
Sunday afternoon excitement it may mean.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a real problem here,'' he said. ``The end of the Cold
War really hit us hard. We were having trouble maintaining our
young people. What I care more about is the people of Hartford
feeling that the city is on the way back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our 6- and 7-year-olds are excited as hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Those intangibles are not unimportant for a city finally
emerging from the recession, the worst economic storm since the
Depression, which raged with particular fury here.
</P>
<P>
   So last Monday night, as Drew Bledsoe, fractured finger and all,
led the Patriots to a last-minute come-from-behind victory over
Miami, beer-soaked fans packed a sports bar in famously sleepy
downtown Hartford. And they cheered as if they'd won the Super
Bowl.

TWO LEADERS WILL MOLD EXXON MOBIL'S CULTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MITCHELL SCHNURMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On paper, they seem so similar. In the flesh, they seem very
different.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Raymond and Lucio Noto, the chief executives of Exxon and
Mobil, respectively, joined their companies in the early 1960s
within a year of each other.
</P>
<P>
   They spent time working abroad and then, after displaying
financial skills, climbed through the ranks at home.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 30 years after joining their organizations, each was
named chairman and chief executive _ again, within 12 months of
each other.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with both at age 60 and with the oil industry in the throes
of extensive consolidation, the paths of Raymond and Noto have
converged, with the agreement to combine their companies in the
biggest merger in history.
</P>
<P>
   As with most mergers, there are concerns over how the two
corporate cultures will mesh. And the two executives will set the
tone.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond, a native of South Dakota, has been described as a
bookish, stern headmaster who disdains publicity and has built a
company known for its financial discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Noto, a Brooklyn native, is more talkative and seems to enjoy
bantering with reporters. His company is considered more
freewheeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their behavior is going to be the example for every Exxon and
Mobil employee in the world,'' said Allen Mesch, director of the
Maguire Oil &AMP; Gas Institute at Southern Methodist University in
Dallas. ``They may not go on long vacations together, but they
better demonstrate more than professional etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're essentially engaged. And engagements can break up over
some pretty small things.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the prospect of their combination prompted The Wall
Street Journal to say this week that it would be like mixing oil
and water. And the mergers-and-acquisitions landscape is littered
with corporate-suite casualties. Some huge deals were even scrapped
because top executives clashed over how to share power.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, BankAmerica President David Coulter resigned amid
reports of conflicts with Hugh McColl, whose NationsBank led the
merger of the financial insitutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a great majority of cases, the No. 2 guy leaves within a
year,'' said Chuck Becker, associate professor of finance at Texas
Christian University in Fort Worth. ``Sometimes people never find a
way to march to the same drummer. And that can extend down through
all the ranks.''
</P>
<P>
   Noto said that won't be an issue at Exxon Mobil because the
leadership is clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to work for Lee,'' Noto said Tuesday at a news
conference in New York. ``I've spent 36 years with Mobil, and
believe it or not, for 32 of those years I actually worked for
people, as opposed to shareholders. And I think I can adapt myself
to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   They have agreed to share power in a way that seems
proportionate to the deal, which calls for Exxon shareholders to
retain a 70 percent stake in the combined company.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond will be chairman, CEO and president. Noto will be vice
chairman of a 19-member board that will include six Mobil
directors.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond and Noto have both been lauded for their willingness to
slash costs and boost performance. In the '90s, they have both cut
thousands of jobs and jettisoned poor-performing properties.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond, who holds a doctorate in chemical engineering from the
University of Minnesota, pushed for stock buybacks when many other
oil companies were investing in risky projects that later failed.
</P>
<P>
   He has been praised for producing the best returns in the energy
business, and he has steadily reduced Exxon's costs, pushing
profits and stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond made clear yesterday that the combined company will
impose the same tough financial discipline on the new operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exxon has set the pace'' for return on capital, Raymond said,
and the company will have ``a relentless commitment to being the
most efficient competitor in each business segment.''
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks yesterday, Raymond was usually short and to the
point, with little flourish. Noto, by contrast, came across as more
conversational.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter asked for more details about plans to reduce the
work force and sell properties, Raymond said it was premature to
speculate on specifics, adding that legal advisers had told him not
to make any comments until Exxon met with regulators.
</P>
<P>
   A Houston reporter followed up by asking why Exxon was not
offering its own proposal to the Federal Trade Commission, rather
than waiting on the government reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be candid about it,'' Raymond said, ``I'm not interested in
your views on how we should deal with the FTC.''
</P>
<P>
   A few moments later, Raymond was asked about his profit
projections and, after challenging the reporter's assumption about
a company chart, he took another dig.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not very confident about predicting oil prices,'' Raymond
said, ``which is why I like to come to these meetings. So you can
tell me.''
</P>
<P>
   Noto, who has a master's in business administration from Cornell
University, lightened the mood when he was asked about working with
Raymond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Lee and I have a good equation, notwithstanding all
the stuff that's been written about us,'' Noto said. ``We'll do a
bear act if you'll give us a moment.''

NEW YORK STATE IS STARVING SCHOOLS TO BUILD PRISONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vincent Schiraldi has long believed that America has sacrificed
public education for prisons. But even he, the executive director
of the Justice Policy Institute, a Washington, think tank, was not
prepared for the newest evidence.
</P>
<P>
   His institute and the Correctional Association of New York has
reeleased a study that finds that over the last decade, New York
State has made nearly a dollar-for-dollar tradeoff in the building
of prisons and the starving of public universities. Since 1988,
state funding for colleges has plummeted by $615 million. Spending
for prisons has gone up by $761 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dollar-for-dollar aspect really brings this whole debate
into a new light,'' Schiraldi said of the study, funded by the
Rockefeller Foundation and released Tuesday (12/1). ``The debate
used to be locking them up vs. not locking them up. These new data
bring into question, particularly for blue-collar, working-class
families, why the resources that could go to public colleges _
resources that could either provide for lower tuitions or higher
enrollments _ are instead going to lock people up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can now open up the debate to whether the skyrocketing
costs of college are due to some significant degree to paying for
prisons instead.''
</P>
<P>
   In percentages, college spending declined over the last decade
in New York State by 29 percent as prison spending shot up 76
percent. In 1988, New York spent twice as much on universities than
on prisons. By 1996, annual spending for incarceration, $1.6
billion, surpassed the $1.3 billion in the budget for colleges.
</P>
<P>
   The study is more proof that at the same moment that affirmative
action for educated African-Americans and Latinos is under
withering attack, this society is throwing poorly educated people
of color into the waste bin. The explosion of prisons has not been
fueled by the need to lock up violent marauders. Last year,
two-thirds of new prisoners were nonviolent offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Several studies, including a major one last year by the Rand
Corp., have said clearly that drug treatment is a far more
effective deterrent to drug abuse and crime than mandatory minimum
sentences. Up to now, few politicians have listened. In New York,
harsh mandatory sentences have pushed the cost of keeping
nonviolent drug offenders locked up to $680 million a year, a
haunting contrast to the $615 million drop since 1988 in college
spending.
</P>
<P>
   Even though white people make up about 75 percent of New York
State's population and consume about that percentage of all illegal
drugs, only 5 percent of New Yorkers doing time for drug offenses
are white. Even though African-Americans and Latinos are about 25
percent of the state's population, they are 95 percent of the
prisoners locked up for drug offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Worse is that the number of African-Americans and Latinos behind
bars in upstate New York prisons now surpasses the number in the
upstate SUNY system. There are 34,809 African-Americans in upstate
jails, compared with 27,925 in upstate SUNY schools. There are
22,421 Latino prisoners compared with 17,845 SUNY students. In
contrast, there are 274,504 white students in SUNY colleges and
only 10,715 in upstate prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had one in three white men between the ages of 20-29 who
have a criminal record, the president would declare a state of
emergency,'' Schiraldi said. ``I don't want to be inflammatory, but
the only reason this level of incarceration is permitted in our
country is because it is African-Americans and Latinos. If people
are serious in this country about racial equity, prisons have to be
at the crux of any discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   So, too, should be the cost of college. The total cost for
someone who goes away to a SUNY school has risen steeply since
1988, from $6,303 to $11,478. The annual cost has risen from around
20 percent of the national median family income for Latinos and 24
percent of the family income for African-Americans to 42 percent
for both groups.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty of rising costs has hit them much harder than white
families. White families have seen the costs rise from 13.5 percent
of their income to 25 percent. Even so, Schiraldi hopes that white
families might come around to seeing that their pocket is also
being picked by the prison boom. Everyone should question a system
where it costs $30,000 a year to keep one person in prison, money
that could send nearly three students away to SUNY or nearly nine
students who live at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the politicians' pandering to people's worst
emotions about crime and fear-mongering has won the day,''
Schiraldi said. ``Because times are good now, some people are
trying to figure out how to make college more affordable, and
that's good. But unless something changes, when times go bad again,
universities will feel the blows. The prisons will continue to
flourish.''

 By SUZANNE C. RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Where's the absolutely hottest spot to buy clothes for high
school these days?
</P>
<P>
   A. The Gap.
</P>
<P>
   B. J. Crew.
</P>
<P>
   C. Banana Republic.
</P>
<P>
   D. Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch.
</P>
<P>
   If you didn't guess Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, you must be an
out-of-touch adult or a clueless freshman.
</P>
<P>
   Every junior and senior knows Abercrombie is the place to shop.
And hang out after school. ``It's trendy,'' says Florina Gordon,
16, a junior at Boston Latin School. ``I come every week.''
</P>
<P>
   And why not? The music is cutting-edge and so loud that it
drives out most adults. The clothes are cool though not
cutting-edge. And the catalog is sexy _ so racy in fact that some
parents in Brookline, Mass. are now considering protesting weekly
in front of local stores. ``The message is `Sex is cool,'''
complains Dori Stern, a parent and teacher who protested in front
of the Atrium Mall on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't hurt Abercrombie's image among high schoolers that
college students like Kelly Fernandes of Northeastern University
are flocking to the store as well. ``I'm applying for a job here
because I want the discount,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Even better, unlike at the Gap, there are no young kids spilling
over from adjacent stores like Gap Kids and Baby Gap _ destroying
all sense of coolness. ``My little brother is still into the Gap.
It's his favorite store,'' sighs Karen McCarthy, 18, a senior at
South Boston High School, of her 14-year-old sibling. ``I think
Abercrombie is more sophisticated.''
</P>
<P>
   Just where did this Abercrombie craze come from? It's weird. A
lot of the styles are so classically casual, they probably predate
your grandfather: rustic plaid cotton shirts; simple baseball caps;
corduroy coats; sweaters with horizontal stripes; and reversible
gym shirts (yellow on one side, blue on the other, for example).
</P>
<P>
   And ironically, this is a company that's known to old-timers for
selling fishing rods and guns, of all things. Abercrombie was
founded in 1892 as a sporting goods and expedition-equipment store.
Over the years, it's dressed people like Ernest Hemingway and
Theodore Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   But that's really all ancient history now. The modern-day
Abercrombie put itself on the map six years ago when it hired chief
executive Michael Jeffries. Jeffries's strategy was simple: Target
college kids by promoting the American college experience.
</P>
<P>
   Following the path of designers like Calvin Klein and Donna
Karan, Abercrombie's ads are filled with sexy, edgy images of
muscular young men with chests bared, arms bulging, and boxer
shorts showing. As in Tommy Hilfiger's and Ralph Lauren's ads,
Abercrombie's models are athletic and privileged-looking, often
pictured outdoors on ski lifts or boating, camping, skinny-dipping,
and playing football.
</P>
<P>
   Abercrombie hired well-known fashion photographer Bruce Weber to
shoot its campaign. And the results are a marketer's dream: Girls
are now hanging Abercrombie shopping bags on their walls.
</P>
<P>
   Abercrombie's network of stores, which has grown from 40
nationwide in 1992 to 177, routinely hires staffers from local
college campuses. Dressed head to toe in merchandise, these clerks
are virtually indistinguishable from shoppers _ a good selling
point for impressionable teens.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Abercrombie made what was probably its most
remarkable move: It created a ``magalogue,'' or magazine/catalog,
called the A&AMP;F Quarterly. Unlike most catalogs, this one is
actually entertaining. Written in part by college students, the
Christmas issue includes (in addition to pages of clothing spreads)
a holiday film guide with an A list (``Meet Joe Black'' and ``Enemy
of the State'') and an F list (``Star Trek: Insurrection'' and ``I
Still Know What You Did Last Summer'').
</P>
<P>
   There's also a profile of author Bret Easton Ellis
(``Glamorama'' and ``American Psycho''); a book list; a CD list;
lists of recommended outdoors equipment, snow resorts, trendy
technology (like the flat TV), and volunteer opportunities. There
are also New Year's resolutions: Get up before noon, call Mom, read
a book with no pictures, promise not to make anyone MADD, and get
off the couch.
</P>
<P>
   Punchy and clever, the book, from a marketing standpoint, makes
Abercrombie stand way out from the pack. ``To be able to look at a
magalogue and have it tell you what to pack for school, where you
should go to be in the know. ... It's state of the art,'' says Tom
Julian, a trend analyst for New York ad agency Fallon McElligott.
``The fact that it's written (in part) by college students means
it's definitely the audience talking to the audience.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Abercrombie says it has a paid circulation of 200,000
for the quarterly, the retailer, based in Reynoldsburg, Ohio, has
learned that trying to be too cool can backfire sometimes. Consider
these controversial elements of the latest issue: party game
descriptions like Strip Yahtzee, Dirty Scrabble, and Naked Twister
(``Right hand red was never this much fun'') and recipes for
post-party pick-me-ups like Irish coffee (``Add a good slug of
Irish whiskey ... to freshly brewed, strong black coffee.'').
</P>
<P>
   There is a picture of a naked young man in bed with four
adolescent girls. All of them have their mouths open, as if they
were caught in the act, and two of the girls are holding a pair of
men's boxer shorts. There's also a shot of a young couple lying on
the grass. The young man is naked, with his bottom exposed. The
girl has on a skimpy dress. And a third photo _ albeit out of focus
_ shows three couples sleeping in the same bed. At least one of the
young men is naked.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very calculated marketing,'' says Frances Avrin, a and
lawyer who attended Saturday's protest. ``Whatever they can do to
sell, they're going to do it. ... I feel it crosses the line.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time Abercrombie has enraged parents. In
July _ shortly after it was spun off from the Limited Inc. to
become an independent company _ Abercrombie recalled its
Back-to-School '98 issue. Mothers Against Drunk Driving was
protesting a two-page article called ``Drinking 101,'' which
included drinking games and recipes for mixed drinks like ``brain
hemorrhages'' that the quarterly suggested students substitute for
the standard beer binge.
</P>
<P>
   In postcards sent to its magalogue readers, the company said
that ``under no circumstances does Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch support
underage or binge drinking. Although it was not meant in a serious
vein, we made a mistake in describing a `drinking game' that could
be interpreted as encouraging binge drinking.''
</P>
<P>
   All the parental protesting in the world may not hurt
Abercrombie's popularity with high school kids, but the retailer
may still shoot itself in the foot. This summer, Abercrombie opened
its first test store designed exclusively for 7- to 14-year-olds,
called ``abercrombie.'' To date, there are 11 such stores in the
United States (including one in Fanueil Hall), and in February, the
company will decide whether to expand.
</P>
<P>
   While little kids may love dressing like their older siblings,
it's unlikely the feeling will be mutual. For students like
McCarthy, the idea is a turnoff. ``It wouldn't have that preppy
look anymore,'' she says. While McCarthy concedes that little kids
would probably look cute in the gear, she wants no part of
Abercrombie if it becomes a middle-school trend. She says, ``I'd
look around for something else.''

`BEEDIES' ARE TEENS' NEWEST ADDICTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN O'BRIEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jose Barrios is a marketing man's dream teen, sitting on the
crumbling cement stairwell across from Madison Park High School in
a navy Tommy Hilfiger &UR;  &LR; jacket, baggy Fubu jeans, and Timberland
all-purpose boots.
</P>
<P>
   And like boys and girls across the city, 16-year-old &UR;  &LR; Barrios
has in his pocket the latest fad to sweep through high schools and
city blocks _ beedies.
</P>
<P>
   Thin Indian cigarettes in sweet flavors like cherry and vanilla,
beedies _ or bidis, depending on the brand _ come in pink packages
that make them look more like party favors than a pack of smokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not really cigarettes like a Marlboro that has
nicotine and tar and stuff like that,'' Barrios explained.
</P>
<P>
   But state health officials say Barrios, like plenty of teens in
Boston and other cities across the country, is wrong: The tiny
brown unfiltered cigarettes contain tobacco and have high levels of
tar and nicotine.
</P>
<P>
   And they are now piling up on the desks of urban school
principals, seized from youths who clamor for the newest must-have
on counters of small markets in the Boston neighborhoods of
Dorchester, Mattapan, Roxbury, and Jamaica Plain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a phenomenon we are just now seeing,'' said Greg
Connolly, who heads the state's tobacco control program for the
Department of Public Health. ``It's mostly in ethnic neighborhoods.
It's become sort of urban chic.''
</P>
<P>
   First a fad with underage smokers in Los Angeles about five
years ago, the beedies craze has slowly moved across the country
through cities like San Francisco, Cleveland, and Chicago, and is
currently ablaze in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco earlier this year, a survey of 461 students at
four city high schools found that 58 percent of them had tried
beedies at least once or knew someone who had. Connolly said he is
considering surveying a high school in Boston or Cambridge for
similar information.
</P>
<P>
   Hand-rolled in India, beedies are unfiltered and tapered at one
or both ends and resemble a marijuana cigarette more than a
standard, machine-rolled Camel or Winston.
</P>
<P>
   But health officials in California say a beedie contains about 8
percent nicotine, up to four times the levels found in standard
American cigarettes. Compared with a Marlboro, a beedie has more
than twice the level of tar, a cancer-causing agent.
</P>
<P>
   And some brands sold in Boston come with a US surgeon general's
warning: Cigarettes contain carbon monoxide.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly believes that distributors of beedies are targeting
poor or minority neighborhoods. And some storekeepers are either
confused about whether they are illegally selling tobacco to
underage smokers or don't care.
</P>
<P>
   But &UR;  &LR; there is consensus on why teenagers find the exotic
cigarettes, a blend of Indian tobacco and other plant leaves, so
appealing.
</P>
<P>
   At an average of $2 for a pack of 20, they are about half the
cost of a standard pack of cigarettes; the price of beedies,
however, varies from store to store. And a smoldering beedie has a
funky odor similar to marijuana and incense smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get a kick out of it,'' said Joseph Moscaritolo, Madison
Park High School assistant director. ``They want you to think they
are smoking marijuana.''
</P>
<P>
   In Cambridge, Lynn Rufo, manager of the Central Square smoke
shop, said her store stocks beedies but refuses to sell them to the
teenagers who constantly ask for them. She has asked some of them
why beedies are so popular.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``They are a big deal,'' Rufo said. ``From what I can gather,
the kids say they can get thrown out of places because it smells
like they are smoking marijuana. &UR;  &LR; And a lot of them say they are
not as addictive as cigarettes.''
</P>
<P>
   School officials and campus police officers say that when they
catch students lighting up, the youths often argue that the beedies
are not dangerous to their health.
</P>
<P>
   ``One kid told me he smokes them because they don't give you
lung cancer,'' Moscaritolo said.
</P>
<P>
   Like a handful of store owners interviewed in the city, Joshua
Drigo, owner of a small Roxbury convenience store, said he began
carrying beedies a few months ago, but will not sell them to
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of business people think it's not tobacco, you
know,'' Drigo said.
</P>
<P>
   And, like other store owners, he suspects that some adults are
buying the beedies for youths.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all want their beedies,'' Drigo said. ``I tell them no,
but they can get someone else to (come in and) buy it for them.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Boston School Police Lieutenant Michael Hennessey said that
busy, neighborhood stores can get away with selling beedies to
children because the bright, cone-shaped packages are easier for
their customers to conceal than a box of mainstream cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just too bad that these stores would take advantage of
the kids,'' Hennessey said. ``We find them on kids as young as 13.
The kids are smoking those more than anything else. We confiscate
them all day long.''
</P>
<P>
   Smokers would be hard-pressed to find beedies stocked in chain
convenience stores. At the Christy's Market on Centre Street in
Jamaica Plain, the sales clerk said she'd never heard of them, but
the small grocers nearby say they have plenty in stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can buy them,'' boasted one 15-year-old girl puffing on a
beedie near Fields Corner last week. ``But they always tell me that
I have to come in when no one else is around.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have vanilla, pineapple, cherry, grape, licorice, and
strawberry,'' said Dino Lopes, a 15-year-old Madison Park student
who does not smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never tried it _ OK, maybe a couple of times, but I hated
it,'' Lopes said. ``It gets you very light-headed.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, anyway, I don't consider a beedie as a cigarette.''

CHRISTIANS FROM MANY LANDS TO SEEK COMMON GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For 2,000 years, Christians have struggled to fulfill Jesus's
prayer that all people be united in one church.
</P>
<P>
   From the very beginning, Christianity has been marked _ many
would say marred _ by divisions and feuds.
</P>
<P>
   Schisms, from the break between Orthodox Christianity and the
Roman Catholic Church to the Protestant Reformation, have been the
hallmark of relations among Christians for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years ago, in a historic conclave in Amsterdam, Christian
leaders banded together to try to chart a new course for
Christianity _ one emphasizing the qualities that unite, rather
than separate, followers of the world's largest religion.
</P>
<P>
   So was born the World Council of Churches, an ambitious
ecumenical organization that will celebrate its 50th anniversary,
beginning Thursday (12/3), with a general assembly expected to draw
thousands of Christians to Harare, Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   There is much to cheer about for an organization created in the
aftermath of World War II amid a strong desire to find ways to heal
the wounds of war.
</P>
<P>
   With 500 million Christians represented through 332 churches,
denominations and fellowships in 120 countries, the World Council
of Churches has helped foment better relations and better
understanding on every continent.
</P>
<P>
   In places like Massachusetts, the ability of different Christian
denominations to work together on social, religious, economic, and
other issues is largely due to the seeds planted by the council.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be the only place where concerns about the life of the
Christian church can be addressed in a broad and very diverse
arena,'' said the Rev. Richard Signore, rector of St. Peter's
Episcopal Church in Buzzards Bay, who will attend the meeting in
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   One tangible byproduct of the ecumenical movement spurred by the
World Council of Churches is the level of cooperation among
Christian churches in the delivery of humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time in the early part of this century, according to
the Rev. Diane C. Kessler, executive director of the Massachusetts
Council of Churches, when Christian missionary groups would compete
over who would provide relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the (World Council of Churches) didn't exist, we would have
to invent it,'' said Kessler, who has been chosen editor of the
English version of the final general assembly report.
</P>
<P>
   But the World Council of Churches faces several significant
problems that strike at the core of its foundation. One prominent
missing member is the Roman Catholic Church, home to 1 billion
Catholics around the world. The church is not likely to formally
join the council anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   The council also faces the prospect of losing its single biggest
member _ the 80 million-member Russian Orthodox Church.
</P>
<P>
   The church is sending just three representatives and is
contending with an uprising among conservatives who denounce the
world council for its discussions of feminist theology and
homosexual clergy. Conservative leaders say associating with the
council would besmirch the Russian Orthodox Church's image.
</P>
<P>
   Orthodox leaders also are smarting over efforts by some
evangelical Christian groups to rush into the former Soviet
republics after the collapse of communism to win converts.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, accusations that the council is tilting to the left
have been leveled by conservative and evangelical Christians in
other denominations, particularly in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative movements within several North American Protestant
mainline denominations, for example, are sending a delegation to
Zimbabwe to challenge what they say is the council's drift away
from biblical authority.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from concerns about the council's direction on gays and
women, conservatives are alarmed that some within the council want
to expand dialogue to include non-Christian religions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned that the council could be signing its own
death warrant because of its current direction,'' said Janice Shaw
Crouse, director of the Ecumenical Coalition on Women and Society,
a conservative Christian group. ``The council is moving in a
direction contrary to Scripture.''
</P>
<P>
   The open and vocal disagreements among Christians promise to
make for lively discussions in Harare.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of being seen as a reason to abandon the ecumenical
movement, Kessler, of the Massachusetts Council of Churches, said
the disputes underscore the importance of the council's work _ no
matter how difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a marker moment in the life of the church,'' she said.
``We still have a lot of work ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   (AT)5Religion Notes
</P>
<P>
   (AT)7 _ Bishop Donald Trautman, the conservative leader of the
Roman Catholic Diocese of Erie, Pa., has drawn the proverbial line
in the sand.
</P>
<P>
   He recently informed politicians who endorse abortion rights
that they are no longer welcome to speak at church-owned
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge, a Catholic who supports
abortion rights even though he personally opposes abortion, said he
has no problem adhering to Trautman's wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Trautman's controversial decision follows the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops' adoption of a new, stricter policy
statement on abortion and the role of public officials.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference eight days ago, Trautman defended his
position by quoting from the Bishops' policy statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Catholics who are privileged to serve in public leadership
positions have an obligation to place their faith at the heart of
their public service, particularly on issues regarding the sanctity
and dignity of human life,'' the statement reads.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge told reporters, ``I intend on honoring my bishop's
instructions.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The leader of the United Church of Christ has reaffirmed the
denomination's support for gay rights in a pastoral letter to all
congregations in the 1.4 million-member church.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign against homosexuals by many conservative
politicians and religious leaders this summer convinced me that
another Christian voice needed to be heard,'' said the Rev. Paul H.
Sherry in a letter that he asked be read from the pulpits of the
more than 6,000 UCC churches.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry's letter also was prompted by the murder of Matthew
Shepard, the gay college student who was fatally beaten in Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be it slavery, women's rights, or human rights, every age
demands that Christians look at Scripture with `new eyes,''' Sherry
wrote. ``All this has helped us discover that our church's concern
for the rights and dignity of gay, lesbian and bisexual people is
not a break from our past, or a departure from Scripture, but is
informed by our moments of greatest fidelity to the prophetic voice
of the Bible and the gospel's embrace of those who, with Christ,
have been despised.''

NEW HAMPSHIRE'S PRIMARY ADVANTAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The coordinated effort by California and eight other Western
states (a.k.a. the Thundering Herd) to move their presidential
primaries closer to New Hampshire's February-of-2000 kickoff may be
one of those carefully plotted political maneuvers that goes ``Pow!
Right in the kisser!'' to the plotters.
</P>
<P>
   The megastate and its followers, tired of hearing how much
influence tiny New Hampshire has on the selection process, want to
elbow their way toward the front of the field. Fine, in theory.
</P>
<P>
   The Westerners want candidates talking about ``their'' issues _
mining, grazing rights on federal property, harvesting (looting?)
timber from public lands, agribusiness poaching of diminishing
water supplies, etc.
</P>
<P>
   But the resulting jam at the start of the delegate-selecting
race _ ``frontloading'' in consultant lingo _ may have quite the
opposite effect of what the Western states intended. It's possible
to construct a theory that makes New Hampshire's snowy verdict even
more important to the wannabes than previously. How come? We start
with the money.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody seriously thinks this Congress will substantially alter
the present system of collecting and spending money to win federal
office. Sure, it's corrupt, inefficient, a scandal, a mine field,
blah-blah. But it also favors incumbents of both parties, so
nothing will change in D.C. until, state by state, enough states
enact their own sorts of reforms that can culminate in a federal
law requiring free or low-cost broadcast time for major-party
candidates. But that's another column.
</P>
<P>
   To run a serious national campaign for president, the consensus
of experts is that you need a large sum _ say, $22 million, the
vast bulk of it in hand by next New Year's Eve. So for each day of
1999, Mr. I-wanna-be-president must raise $60,000, give or take, in
order to be at the front of the trough.
</P>
<P>
   There are only a handful of men _ no women visible at this
juncture, sad to report _ with any reasonable shot at raising that
kind of money. They are: Vice President Al Gore, the prohibitive
favorite on the Democratic side, and on the Republican side,
Governor George W. Bush of Texas, who sits atop a gusher of oil and
other kinds of Texas money, Lamar Alexander, and Steve Forbes. The
latter two have been advertising on New Hampshire television since
last August, believe it or not.
</P>
<P>
   It would take a lot of breaks for Republican hopefuls like
former vice president Dan Quayle, the best-known of the second
tier, or California's Governor Pete Wilson, Representative John
Kasich of Ohio, Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri, or even the
widely praised Senator John McCain of Arizona to crack the
60-grand-per-day club. Not even his close friends think Senator Bob
Smith, the GOP homeboy of the Granite State, could come close.
</P>
<P>
   Either party could win or lose the whole kit and caboodle next
time _ House, Senate, White House. Turnout will be way up,
increasing the Democrats' chances of making solid gains. That makes
it more likely that the House minority leader, Dick Gephardt of
Missouri, will not run for president, leaving the
who'll-challenge-Gore chores to the likes of Senators Bob Kerrey of
Nebraska, John Kerry of Massachusetts, Paul Wellstone of Minnesota,
and former senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey. Not exactly
Murderer's Row in the money-raising department, unless you count in
the two-thirds of a billion pile accrued by Kerry's spouse, the
redoubtable Teresa Heinz.
</P>
<P>
   Just how does this discussion of filthy lucre affect the primary
calendar? With California and the Thundering Herd crowding forward
from the rear to the front of the schedule, it shortens the time in
which a candidate can build name recognition, organize some
semblance of a grass-roots effort on the ground, and raise enough
money to be competitive in the disgracefully expensive world of
television advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called ``free media'' _ newspaper and broadcast coverage
_ concentrate on the horse race, the candidates' inevitable gaffes
and screwups, the confetti tossed in the air by those who wish you
ill. Rare is the outsider _ wrestler-turned-Governor-elect Jesse
Ventura is one _ who can sneak under the media's radar screen to
score points with actual voters.
</P>
<P>
   Without a top-three finish in Iowa's jury-rigged caucuses, a
candidate is extremely unlikely to do much in New Hampshire a week
later. But do well in New Hampshire and your mug is on the cover of
Time and Newsweek, the cable networks go bananas making you a
household name, and with the calendar scrunched toward the weeks
just after New Hampshire, the single biggest bang you can get is to
come out of the Granite State as the man who is hot-hot-hot!
</P>
<P>
   With the lights going out on the Republican congressional
leadership's broken-down impeachment effort and the media hounds
dousing their Monica cigars for the nuts and bolts of presidential
positioning, the road to the White House has to go through New
Hampshire, the Panama Canal of the process.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will probably secure the support of Governor Jeanne
Shaheen, she of the 70 percent approval rating. New Hampshire is
friendly territory. Even his wife is popular there; Tipper is
regarded as Hillary without the barbed wire.
</P>
<P>
   (A GOP note: last Friday on CNN's ``Inside Politics'' I
incorrectly said Representative John Sununu supports Forbes. Sununu
is uncommitted.)

ELDERS TOO OFTEN IN HARM'S WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN McNAMARA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   She was a loyal alumna of Wheaton College, where she had been an
English major in the all-female Class of '36.
</P>
<P>
   She was a walker in her Arlington Heights neighborhood, where
the hills can present a challenge to calves decades younger than
her own.
</P>
<P>
   She was a lady-who-lunched, at whatever new restaurant her group
of longtime friends had discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever image one summons to mind at news that an old woman has
been beaten and scalded, nearly to death, in her own home, it is a
fair bet that Jane Sheard does not fit the stereotype. At 85, she
is elderly only by the calendar's measure; by all others she is _
or was _ more vital than many half her age.
</P>
<P>
   She was neither frail in body nor feeble in spirit when she fell
victim to a category of violence that too often occurs out of
public view. It was only the severity of Mrs. Sheard's injuries _
several broken ribs, a fractured skull, a broken wrist, multiple
broken fingers, and second degree burns over 15 percent of her body
_ that forced us to pause and take notice.
</P>
<P>
   On the day after Thanksgiving, authorities allege, 85-year-old
Jane Sheard was battered within an inch of her life by her own
daughter. While her mother is clinging to life in the intensive
care unit at the Leahy Clinic, Nancy Reida, 54, is undergoing
court-ordered psychiatric tests.
</P>
<P>
   One can only hope that Mrs. Sheard's daughter is crazy.
</P>
<P>
   How much easier to believe that a woman would have to be insane
to pour boiling water over her already vanquished mother than to
accept that such acts of brutality are tragically commonplace in
the lives of the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   The latest statistics compiled by the state's Executive Office
of Elder Affairs offer no such solace, however, indicating as they
do just how frequently older people are victimized by their
caregivers, often their own children. In fiscal 1998, there were
6,010 reports of elder abuse in Massachusetts, a substantial
increase over the year before. Indeed, such violence has increased
every year since fiscal 1984, when the state began tracking abuse
of the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those numbers have faces for Marian Ryan, an assistant
district attorney who has been prosecuting elder abuse cases for 20
years. She estimates that 25 such cases land on her desk every
month. The numbers go up during the holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   The crimes, she says, do not occur just in some tenements or
housing projects. She has 12 cases. The offenders, she says, are
not just cruel home health aides. There is, for instance, the son
who broke his elderly mother's arm in the middle of the day in the
center of what Ryan describes as ``a very nice town.'' Imagine what
was happening to her in private.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not what people think. More often than not, it's an adult
child who has moved back to the parents' home. It's often a nice
home; it's the financial security that lures them back. He or she
usually has problems of his own, drugs or alcohol maybe. Sometimes
a parent is frail and needs constant care; maybe she has
Alzheimer's. The frustration builds. It's inexcusable, but at least
it's more understandable than what happened to Mrs. Sheard.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what happened to Mrs. Sheard is a matter for the courts
to decide, but what may yet end in death might well have begun as
an argument about the family china. Every plate in the house was
smashed.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sheard had been due to try out a new restaurant with her
lunch bunch last Friday but canceled because her son was visiting
from western Massachusetts. Her pals called later to tease her
about what a fine meal she had missed and became alarmed when her
telephone went unanswered. Concerned, they stopped by Tanager
Street, a tidy neighborhood of one- and two-family houses built
into the side of a hill in Arlington, a Boston suburb. When they
got no response to their knock, they called again. After several
rings, Mrs. Sheard picked up the receiver. ``I'm bleeding,'' she
whispered, before dropping the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters had only to follow the bloody handprints on the
wall to locate Mrs. Sheard at the top of the staircase where she
had dragged herself to reach the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   In District Court this week, Nancy Reida looked vacant when she
was committed for a 20-day psychiatric evaluation. The baggy blue
sweatshirt she wore proclaimed that ``Nothing is impossible if you
don't have to do it yourself,'' a message as enigmatic as the crime
for which Jane Sheard's daughter stands accused.

TRUE BELIEVER HEDGES HIS BET ON THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even Joe McNay, the truest believer among Boston's Internet
investors, thinks all this has gotten nuts.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 18 months, no one in this town has bet more of his
money on those incredible rising Internet stocks than McNay,
chairman of Essex Investment Management. The biggest positions in
his portfolio read like a who's who among the pricest stocks in the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Essex, with roughly $5 billion under management, was the largest
institutional owner of Amazon.com at the end of the September
quarter, and it was the firm's biggest single holding. Yahoo, CMG
Information Services, and America Online were three of his next
five largest holdings, according to the Carson Group, a New York
consulting firm. He was the second-largest institutional owner of
eBay and had top 10 positions in such Internet favorites as
(AT)Home, Lycos, Excite, and Network Solutions.
</P>
<P>
   But now, McNay is stepping back. In the past two weeks, as the
stocks have risen fast, McNay has cut his Internet positions
roughly in half. McNay reduced the Internet exposure in his
institutional accounts to 10 percent and to 15 percent in his more
aggressive hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it had become a short-term mania,'' McNay said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   After posting sharp gains for several weeks, Internet stocks
tanked on Monday, with the American Stock Exchange Internet index
falling 7 percent. Yahoo plunged nearly 25 points, or 12 percent;
Amazon.com fell 24 5/8, or 8 percent; and Onsale Inc. was down more
than 36, or 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks recovered some of their gains Tuesday, but McNay
doesn't think the correction is over. He won't name names, but says
he has started selling short _ betting the prices will continue to
fall _ some of the lesser Net companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies that have moved from 20 to 90 in a week that we feel
weren't worth 20,'' he says. Hello Onsale?
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake: McNay is not walking away from the Internet.
Just the opposite, in fact. He calls it ``the biggest revolution
that has occurred in my lifetime in terms of the impact it will
have on us in little ways and big ways.''
</P>
<P>
   This is McNay's kind of market. He is maybe Boston's most
prominent momentum investor, who looks for the big concept and then
rides it up. He did that with oil service stocks in the late 1970s,
cellular telephones and waste management in the late '80s. He was
an early and big player in biotechnology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe is one of the best conceptual momentum investors of his
time,'' says James Pallotta, who worked in McNay's shop until 1993
and now runs a $1.3 billion hedge fund in Boston for Tudor
Investments.
</P>
<P>
   Momentum investing doesn't come without volatility. Over the
last year through Sept. 30, McNay's growth-equity portfolios, which
contain the lion's share of the assets, were up 6.96 &UR;  &LR; percent,
ranking them in the top 10 percent of all institutional midcap
growth managers tracked by Pensions &AMP; Investments. But those same
growth portfolios ranked among the bottom 20 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Returns for two of McNay's hedge funds show just how hot the
Internet stocks have been for him this year. His Essex High Tech
fund, with about $40 million in assets, was up a stunning 86
percent through Nov. 30 and his Permal Media and Communications
fund, with $38 million in assets, was up 43 percent through Nov.
15. Both funds are available only to clients outside the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Internet stocks, McNay continues to like companies
that have ``the true franchise positions.'' He mentions America
Online, Yahoo, Amazon.com, Lycos, eBay. He also continues to like
CMG as an incubator of evolving Internet technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have some of the biggest smart money in the United States
invested behind them,'' McNay says.
</P>
<P>
   But until the prices come down, McNay is unlikely to be a buyer.
By the end of the third quarter, after all, his holdings taken
together carried a price-earnings ratio of 40, nearly 50 percent
higher than the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500, Carson says.
</P>
<P>
   What's he done with all that money he has pulled out of the
Internet companies? ``For a little while cash doesn't feel bad,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Red Herring
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thomas O'Neill, chief investment officer for Fleet Investment
Advisors, has himself a nice little side gig: running three hedge
funds.
</P>
<P>
   At a tough time to find money in the suddenly suspect hedge fund
business, O'Neill raised $100 million for the three funds,
including an undisclosed sum from his daytime employer, Fleet
Financial Group, according to a bank spokesman. The funds are
geared to institutions and wealthy individuals, and will pursue
traditional long and short trading in both US and foreign
securities.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill will presumably charge the industry standard fees of 1
percent of assets and 20 percent of profits _ not bad for a kid who
grew up in South Boston and went to Harvard on a scholarship.

MYTH OF YOUNG COMPUTER HACKERS LOSES A BIT 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sean Trifero awoke one morning in May &UR;  &LR; as federal agents stormed
into his bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Arrested in his boxer shorts, Trifero was charged with
``computer abuse.'' Last month, the 21-year-old from Middletown,
R.I., pleaded guilty in US District Court in Boston to charges he
shut down or illegally accessed five university and commercial
computer systems _ intrusions the Justice Department says caused
damages of about $67,500. He faces sentencing in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case graphically shows the harm that hackers can cause,''
says Donald K. Stern, the US attorney for Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   But exactly how much harm is that? The federal judge overseeing
the case has questioned whether the damages caused by Trifero were
really as high as the government figures.
</P>
<P>
   The charges also fell far short of earlier suspicions, described
by the FBI in November 1997, which had painted Trifero as a menace
to society. The agency, which began investigating Trifero earlier
that year, reported he boasted of attacking White House computers,
shutting down MCI Worldcom Inc. telephone switching equipment, and
discussed intrusions by another hacker into a NASA facility.
</P>
<P>
   Trifero's attorney, Edward St. Onge of Providence, R.I. won't
discuss the FBI's assertions, but says his client's only motive was
gamesmanship. ``What Sean did involved a chess game between man and
machine, and he got a little carried away,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   To some, the Trifero case and others like it suggest that the
supposedly omnipotent young hacker is more myth than fact. Indeed,
many accused youngsters turn out to be much like
Trifero &UR;  &LR; _ &UR;  &LR; nuisances to the private sector, but perhaps not
threats to national security like the teenagers portrayed in the
1983 movie ``War Games.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the myth resonates, in part because many of the
highest-profile cases brought by the Justice Department involve
boastful young defendants. Some even say federal officials have
overblown the threat to build support for the Justice Department's
growing computer crimes unit and a new $29
million &UR;  &LR; computer-security center in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids are a very convenient scapegoat,'' says John
Vranesevich, principal of AntiOnline LLP, an Internet news service
based &UR;  &LR; in Beaver, Pa. &UR;  &LR; George Smith, editor of the on-line Crypt
Newsletter in Pasadena, Calif., says the actual damages they cause
often are unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're saying that these people can topple the republic, and
that's not likely to happen,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   To prosecutors, the criticism stings. Martha Stansell-Gamm,
deputy chief of the Justice Department's computer crimes unit &UR;  &LR; in
Washington, says officials won't ignore complaints of computer
intrusions because they can't know whether investigation will
reveal ``a surplus of testosterone, or a terrorist'' at the other
end of the wire.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in March 1997 radio equipment at the Worcester
airport was knocked out for six hours by an unauthorized tap into a
telephone-switching device, forcing air-traffic controllers to use
a shorter-range backup radio system. Investigators traced the tap
to a teenager living near the airport, who in March of this year
pleaded guilty to charges he inadvertently shut down the main
system by sending commands from a home PC. He was sentenced to two
years' probation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are cases that start out looking like the crime of the
century and wind up being pretty minor,'' Stansell-Gamm says. ``But
we don't feel badly that we pursued them.''
</P>
<P>
   Trifero's case is typical of many computer-security charges
brought under federal laws passed in 1996. The new rules broadened
the definition of protected equipment to include computers involved
in interstate commerce &UR;  &LR; _ &UR;  &LR; including most of the millions of
computers now connected to the Internet. Previously, hackers were
often charged with wiretapping, with limited success.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules, federal prosecutors have obtained guilty
pleas from 20 defendants for the 12 months ended Sept. 30, up from
nine during the same period two years earlier. Investigations grew
to 254 from 73 over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   These cases tend to involve two types of defendants, says Jeanne
Kempthorne, an assistant US attorney in Boston handling the Trifero
case. One group includes youths who mainly aim to show off on line;
the second includes adults with a grudge, usually against their
former employers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Corporate losses
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department agrees that corporate insiders cause the
most damage. A 1997 survey of 520 technology executives by the FBI
and the Computer Security Institute in San Francisco found
hacking-related losses of $136 million nationwide. The biggest
share of that, $50 million, was attributed to ``unauthorized access
by insiders'' to corporate systems, followed by thefts of
proprietary information and telecommunications fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The group didn't try to estimate the damage caused by underage
users, but in any case they rarely seem to succeed in stealing or
compromising top-secret information from government institutions.
Kempthorne says she wrestles with just how far to push cases
against youngsters who mainly seek notoriety. ``The question is,
how do you do deterrence with this group?'' she says. ``It's a huge
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Trifero's career as an on-line prankster seems to have begun in
1996, the year he turned 19.
</P>
<P>
   Through his attorney, Trifero declined to comment for this
story, citing his upcoming sentencing hearing set for January. He
faces up to 18 months in prison under the terms of his plea
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But court filings and interviews with people who know Trifero
paint a picture of a curious young man with a temper and perhaps
too much regard for his own expertise.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Middletown High School, Trifero began
taking computer science classes at a community college in Warwick,
but grew bored and switched to emergency medicine, family members
say.
</P>
<P>
   By January 1998 he had left school altogether and begun a job as
a telephone-help representative for clients of a staffing service,
RHI Consulting. Aside from some traffic tickets, local police say,
his only other brush with the law came when he was arrested for
illegal possession of fireworks on July 4, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But Trifero's day job may not have been as exciting as his
on-line activities, for which the government alleges he often used
the screen name of ``FA-Q.''
</P>
<P>
   These activities were first brought to the attention of
authorities by John O'Donnell, owner of BBSNet Worldwide in East
Providence, R.I., an on-line service provider to which Trifero paid
$20 a month for access to the Internet.

THERE ARE NO MORE LEADING QUESTIONS ABOUT BLEDSOE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Overlooked in the chaos and excitement of
the Patriots' final drive last Sunday _ and Drew Bledsoe again
putting his name to a signature game with a broken index finger _
was what happened in the next-to-last drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great quarterbacks do what Drew did in that fourth quarter,''
said rookie receiver Tony Simmons. ``And he's the one giving us a
chance to win and he's the one coming through for us. That's why
he's The Man.''
</P>
<P>
   What the team saw in those final moments, said running back
Robert Edwards, ``is that Drew is the leader of this team. And
everybody looks up to him and expects him to make great plays.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened on the last play of the last drive, of course, is
well known. And the new attitude of the team was symbolized by
Simmons, standing on the sidelines next to Terry Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked up to Terry and said, `We're about to win,''' said
Simmons. ``I knew Drew was going to Ben (Coates) on the play and
Ben's a big-time receiver and Drew's a big-time passer.''
</P>
<P>
   But on the previous drive, there was another sign of the new
Bledsoe. With five minutes left in the game, Bledsoe had moved his
team from its own 37-yard line to a first down on Buffalo's 20. But
then his protection broke down. Bledsoe was sacked for a 9-yard
loss by Wayne Simmons on first down and then was rushed and hurried
two incomplete passes.
</P>
<P>
   He got up from the turf twice and lashed out at his offensive
line for breaking down at a crucial time. Adam Vinatieri then
missed a 47-yard field goal attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I'm free (to criticize teammates) only when I feel I'm
playing well myself,'' said Bledsoe, downplaying, as usual, any
perception that he is any different from the Bledsoe of 1997 or
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidentally, when the Patriots took over on their 18-yard
line with 1:52 left, the pass protection was much improved. Even
though the Bills knew he was going to pass on every play (except
perhaps the last one), Bledsoe was not sacked on that final drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that we had to give our quarterback time,'' said
tackle Bruce Armstrong. ``And we did. And Drew got the plays
made.''
</P>
<P>
   On the previous drive, Armstrong recalled, ``We called a couple
of protections down there at the 20-yard line and one incorporated
the tight end on the back side and I think Drew got hit on that one
and then he got pressured on the next one. The problem was that the
Bills were running a lot of stunts down there.''
</P>
<P>
   With rookie tight end Rod Rutledge in the game, and with Damon
Denson making his first start at guard, the Patriot offense was
confused by the Bills' moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a rookie tight end in and a second-year guy at guard,
and this is not to say they can't play and play well, but it just
gives you more of an opportunity to make a mistake,'' said
Armstrong. ``The Bills were coming with two-man and three-man games
and this was the first time these new guys had seen them.''
</P>
<P>
   But after Bledsoe's tongue-lashing, said Armstrong, ``We knew
we'd be better prepared as a unit the next time we saw them.''
</P>
<P>
   As you were on the last drive?
</P>
<P>
   ``As we were on the last drive,'' said Armstrong. ``Exactly.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is crystal clear: This is Drew Bledsoe's team now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we've got the guy now who can make the play,'' said
fullback Tony Carter. ``It makes you feel a lot better knowing that
when you're confronted with the same kind of situation again.''
</P>
<P>
   With no running game and a leaky pass defense _ and especially
with the Denver Broncos in their conference _ these Patriots may
not be going to the Super Bowl, but the question in the back of
many minds for so long is now gone: Even if the Patriots had a
running game and a stout defense, did they have a quarterback with
that intangible Super Bowl quality?
</P>
<P>
   That question was answered twice in two weeks. And it was
answered last Sunday, not only on the final drive, but also on the
previous drive.

 UNDATED: ... the Internet.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   O'Donnell says he contacted Middletown, R.I., police in the fall
of 1996 after receiving complaints from several academic
computer-system operators. One call came from Bowdoin College in
Brunswick, Maine, where a BBSNet user calling himself FA-Q had
tapped into Bowdoin's computers using a stolen password.
</P>
<P>
   A Bowdoin system administrator, Tad Macy, says FA-Q was one of
several dozen users he discovered logged onto the school's
computers without permission, apparently to access free game
software that had been secretly installed. ``It didn't hurt the
system operation, but it was a theft of resources,'' Macy said in a
recent interview. ``It was like somebody storing their couch in
your garage without your permission.''
</P>
<P>
   Another complaint came from Brad Karp, a Harvard University
graduate student. Karp says he noticed a BBSNet user &UR;  &LR; _ &UR;  &LR; apparently
Trifero &UR;  &LR; _ &UR;  &LR; had gained access to his network's central computer and
had run a powerful ``decryption'' program to unscramble passwords.
Karp estimates he spent about 200 hours restoring security, which
he says was particularly galling because the intruder didn't seem
to have written the decryption program himself &UR;  &LR; _ &UR;  &LR; usually a hacker
point of pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't push the envelope in any technical sense,'' Karp
says.
</P>
<P>
   Investigating the complaints, O'Donnell found the FA-Q account
was registered to the Middletown apartment where Trifero lived. He
shut down the account, though he adds, ``I'm not sure I've ever met
a teenager who doesn't go through that stage of rebelliousness.''
</P>
<P>
   But the investigation by local police lagged, and Trifero
returned to the Internet via other access providers. According to a
November 1997 affidavit filed by the FBI to obtain a warrant to
search Trifero's home, he also began to associate with a group of
hackers calling themselves the ``Virii,'' exchanging messages in
Internet chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Chatroom bullies
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Computer administrators who encountered FA-Q and other members
of the Virii say they often bullied their way into others' chat
rooms without permission, dominated e-mail traffic and logged off
legitimate users who complained.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would just lock down the room and claim it for their
own,'' says Rached Blili, who once helped administer the volunteer
network known as the ``Undernet,'' which provides free chat
services. Blili, who now works for a networking company in Cedar
Falls, Iowa, says he remembers FA-Q didn't get much respect when he
first appeared in 1996, although he doesn't recall in which group
FA-Q was a member.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of his friends were ragging on him because he wasn't so
good at hacking,'' recalls Blili. Although FA-Q and others bragged
about breaking into Pentagon computers, Blili says most didn't seem
to have written their own code to do so and didn't seem to have
gained access to much sensitive information. ``It was just a lot of
hot air,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the teasing may have driven Trifero to become more
aggressive. According to his plea agreement and to the FBI
affidavit, by the summer of 1997 he had begun to launch
``denial-of-service'' attacks against commercial computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   These attacks, sometimes known as ``ping-bombs,'' are software
commands that cause scores of outside computers to send brief
messages to a host computer. Unable to keep up, hosts can crash or
run sporadically.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Nebraska attack
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Trifero pleaded guilty to disrupting the
services of Navix, an Internet-access provider in Lincoln, Neb.,
owned by Alliant Communications Inc. According to the FBI's filing,
the attack caused the system to crash, knocking out service to
14,000 subscribers and 1,500 corporate users intermittently over a
36-hour period.
</P>
<P>
   Some subscribers canceled their service as a result, says
Alliant spokeswoman Lela Kelliher, although she declines to discuss
how the government arrived at a damage estimate of $29,500.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to desist, FA-Q often would respond with profanity,
system administrators say. Jason Buchanan, a chat-network volunteer
in Springfield, Mo., says FA-Q mainly wanted attention. But when he
reacted politely, Buchanan wrote in a recent e-mail, FA-Q ``would
reply back with things like `you're not supposed to like me, dude.
Why are you talking with me?'''
</P>
<P>
   Other system operators had less patience, however, and
ultimately an exchange with one in Albuquerque led to FA-Q's
undoing. The administrator, Travis Haymore, says FA-Q launched
numerous attacks on his system from August 1996 until September
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Identifying Trifero with the help of other chat-room
administrators, Haymore says he contacted Middletown, R.I., police
and learned of the ongoing local investigation stemming from
O'Donnell's complaint. Haymore says he brought it to the attention
of FBI agents in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Citing Haymore's account and others, the FBI obtained a warrant
and searched Trifero's apartment on Nov. 4, 1997. On May 13, 1998,
federal agents returned to arrest him on computer-abuse charges,
under the 1996 computer-security laws.
</P>
<P>
   Since his arrest, Trifero has been free on $10,000 bond. He was
fired from his $2,400-a-month job at RHI, and a district court
order bans him from using the Internet while he awaits sentencing.
However, he has found a new job ``related to computers,'' says St.
Onge, his attorney.
</P>
<P>
   St. Onge says Trifero may seek a reduced sentence in return for
volunteering as a consultant to the institutions whose computers he
penetrated. But he may find few takers. O'Donnell, the service
provider, calls the proposal ``a joke'' because of the hacker's
apparent use of software written by others.
</P>
<P>
   Karp, the Harvard system operator, says he wouldn't accept the
help for similar reasons _ and suggests the government's
prosecutions may do too much to legitimize the threat from those
like Trifero.
</P>
<P>
   Says Karp, ``If I were the D.O.J., what I'd be worried about is
the notion that getting busted for computer crimes is the pathway
to a great career.''

THE TROUBLES OVER BATHROOM BREAKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When factory owner Kevin Kevelson locked the door to the women's
bathroom two years ago, he unleashed a gust of angry protests.
</P>
<P>
   Workers picketed and demonstrated. Media descended on the Fall
River, Mass. plant, and the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and
Technical Employees blasted the firm for changing the conditions of
employment without negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never timed employees and we never said they couldn't use
the bathroom,'' recalled Kevelson, owner of Ideal Bias Binding
Inc., a maker of baby bibs. ``All we said was `You have to come in
the office and get the key to go.'''
</P>
<P>
   He said he locked the bathroom and put the key in the office
because he wanted to catch the culprits who were smoking in the
loo, littering the facility with cigarette butts, and violating
fire code regulations barring smoking in some sections of the
factory. But 60 textile workers didn't see it that way.
</P>
<P>
   Kevelson probably did not know it, but access to bathroom and to
rest breaks has long been a troubling problem for poultry,
agricultural, textile, and assembly workers, as well as for
druggists and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa attorney Marc Linder discovered as much while representing
migrant farm workers at a New Mexico dairy. ``These were
Mexican-Americans who could not do anything during their 12-hour
shifts,'' Linder said. ``They couldn't eat. They couldn't go to the
bathroom. They had precious few rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Stunned, Linder began researching state and federal laws
governing rest breaks. Then, he went out and talked to workers. His
findings and those of co-author Ingrid Nygaard led to ``Void Where
Prohibited: Rest Breaks and the Right to Urinate on Company Time''
(Industrial Relations Press, Cornell University, 1998), a book that
details the history of the 15-minute rest break many of us now take
for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The right to rest and void at work is not high on the list of
social or political causes supported by professional or executive
employees, who enjoy personal workplace liberties that millions of
factory workers can only dream about,'' wrote the authors.
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that 24 percent of all
full-time blue-collar and service workers employed by midsized and
large firms did not have rest breaks in 1993, the last year for
which data was available on the topic. Moreover, 51 percent of
part-time blue-collar and service workers and a third of clerical
and sales employees cannot take breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Some examples culled from ``Void Where Prohibited:''
</P>
<P>
   _Female workers at Nabisco sued the Oxnard, Calif., plant three
years ago after receiving a supervisory order telling them to
urinate in their clothes while on the production line or risk
three-day suspensions for taking a bathroom break. The women solved
the immediate problem by wearing adult diapers, but several alleged
that long waits to use the restroom had led to urinary tract
infections and bladder disorders.
</P>
<P>
   _In Kansas, a poultry slaughtering worker who had been denied
permission to use the bathroom was fired after he lost control and
urinated on the factory floor.
</P>
<P>
   Denial of rest breaks is not limited to blue-collar or service
workers, though they are the most likely to be penalized for taking
them. In a study released this month, the Pharmacists Society of
the State of New York reported that nearly 70 percent of the 1,011
pharmacists it surveyed this summer ``found the lack of
opportunites for breaks for lunch, rest, and bathroom particularly
irritating.''
</P>
<P>
   Of those polled, 69 percent were male, and 44 percent were
employed by chains. Only 26 percent were independent owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some situations where the pharmacy is in a supermarket or
retail store, the bathroom break is a problem. Usually, there is
only one pharmacist and he or she cannot leave until the store
closes,'' said Craig Burridge, executive director of the
pharmacists' society. ``These are people working 12- to 16-hour
shifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had pharmacists call here in tears. A year out of
pharmacy school, and they cannot believe it. They feel like they've
become machines,'' said Burridge. They fill twice as many scripts,
they make half as much money, and they can't even use the
bathroom.''
</P>
<P>
   With a classroom of young children needing constant attention,
some elementary school teachers have found ingenious ways to answer
nature's call. ``When we studied women teachers in Des Moines and
Iowa City, Iowa, we found that 1 in 10 had to take the entire class
with her to the bathroom,'' said Linder.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are teachers in public schools that do not have aides,''
he said. ``So, a teacher would line the children up outside the
bathroom stall because she didn't want to leave the class
unattended. Other teachers used adult diapers during the day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're with 23 children all day long, you really can't
run off now and then,'' acknowledged Paula Tranchita, an elementary
school teacher in Winchester. ``I know one kindergarten teacher who
took the children into the bathroom. I guess it was like having her
own in there, multiplied by 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on the third floor and there is no adult bathroom on that
floor,'' she said. ``So, I've learned not to go, or find someone to
stand near the door and watch the classroom. Even when you're
feeling a little off, you cannot just get up and go. You really
have to be creative.''
</P>
<P>
   The hue and cry over what many of us regard as a basic workplace
benefit caught the attention of the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration last year, after the United Food and Commercial
Workers union filed a health and safety complaint against the
Hudson Foods poultry plant in Noel, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   The union also argued that OSHA erred when it required that
bathrooms be at worksites but did not mandate that workers must be
given the time and ability to use them.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA disciplined the firm. Then, it issued a four-page memo
clarifying its current toilet standard to mean that workers should
be allowed ``prompt access to sanitary facilities. ... Restrictions
on access must be reasonable and may not cause extended delays.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Greg Denier, a spokesman for the UFCW in Washington, ``in
almost every union organizing campaign we have these days, the
primary issue is, `Will I get the right to go to the bathroom?'''

TRADITION YIELDS TO NEED TO SURVIVE AT SOME LAW FIRMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers

 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ There's an in-house chef, a weekly cocktail night,
lobster bakes on the sundeck, and waterfront views. No, it's not
Club Med. It's Goulston &AMP; Storrs, a Boston law firm picked by young
associates as the best place in the country to work in a recent
poll by American Lawyer magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The perks are good, and the pay is competitive with New York
firms. But such emblems of lawyerly success _ practically
necessities in the go-go '80s _ meant less to the entry-level
attorneys surveyed than something very '90s: a life.
</P>
<P>
   In the words of a midlevel associate quoted by the magazine,
Goulston &AMP; Storrs topped the other big firms &UR;  &LR;  because ``people
legitimately care if you are overworked.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a warm and fuzzy remark might have been unheard of a decade
ago, when law graduates scrapped for the biggest salaries and
planned to forsake any semblance of a life outside the law,
industry observers say. But now, more and more young lawyers
complain that big firms have become mere meat grinders that chew up
associates with long hours, dull work, and few chances for
advancement. And many now say they are unwilling to sacrifice a
life out of the office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd die if this was it,'' says Amy Moody, a 28-year-old
Goulston &AMP; Storrs associate now in her second year at the firm,
which has 124 lawyers. ``I have friends who work until midnight
every day of the week. Being a lawyer is a big part of my life. But
it's not everything.''
</P>
<P>
   In decidedly un-lawyerly terms like ``connectivity'' and
``sharing,'' Goulston &AMP; Storrs officials say they have tried to
abolish the pain the legal profession commonly inflicts on its
newest entrants. The firm doesn't require associates to fulfill
quotas for billable hours, a departure from accepted industry
practice. Senior partners say they reprimand young associates for
working too much _ a fact that may account for a work week at least
five hours shorter than the national average. Associates and
partners alike rotate offices once every two years, an effort to
downplay class distinctions between the two groups. &UR;  &LR;  And young
lawyers are included in business discussions over lunch, held after
every meeting of the firm's leadership. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Partners are expected to mix socially with associates and even
lend a hand when a young attorney's workload becomes too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number one priority is helping people,'' says managing
partner Michael Haroz. ``We're about counseling, teaching, and
cheerleading.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``A lot of firms view associates as expendable and say only a
few are going to make it to partnership. We look at each of our
associates as prospective partners. That's a fundamental
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Goulston &AMP; Storrs isn't alone. Indeed, Boston appears to have
become a mecca for good feeling among associates. Seven of the top
20 firms named in the American Lawyer survey of the nation's 153
biggest firms are in the city. Mintz Levin Cohn Ferris Glovsky &AMP;
Popeo ranked third; Hale and Dorr, sixth; Goodwin Procter &AMP; Hoar,
11th; Testa Hurwitz &AMP; Thibeault, 13th; Ropes &AMP; Gray, 15th; Palmer &AMP;
Dodge, 16th.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, associates said they gave high marks because of
the atmosphere at their firms.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing last in Boston was Bingham Dana, which ranked near the
bottom nationally at 136. Associates ``complained of feeling
isolated and put off by the firm's cliquishness,'' &UR;  &LR; the magazine
said. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The new emphasis on treatment of associates came about because
of &UR;  &LR;  a sea change during the 1980s in the way big law firms were
managed. The number of law school graduates nationwide quadrupled
to 40,000 a year during the decade and ``changed the profession
forever,'' says Jane Sender, who runs a Boston legal placement
service.
</P>
<P>
   Before the boom, graduates could expect to live out their
careers at the firm they signed with after law school, she says.
And while the life of new associates always consisted of long hours
and occasional abuse from domineering partners, they could expect
to share in the firm's best work and count on eventually becoming
partners themselves. Young lawyers often likened the process to
joining the priesthood, a compact for life.
</P>
<P>
   But with the glut of new attorneys _ and an explosion of legal
work, much of it a result of the business boom of the decade _
firms ballooned in size. A gulf widened between rain-making
partners and the hordes of inexperienced associates who
increasingly assumed run-of-the-mill tasks, Sender says.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects for advancement became slim as a glut of new lawyers
competed for relatively few spots at the top of the totem pole,
breeding what some attorneys considered a new and poisonous kind of
politics at many firms. And when the '80s economic boom turned to
bust, firms struggled for survival. Associates increasingly were
viewed simply as cheap labor, worker bees on a treadmill that
became known as ``assembly line law.'' Few associates would ever
make partner.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of all new associates now quit their firm within six
years, according to a survey this year by the National Association
of Law Placement. One-third quit in less than three.
</P>
<P>
   ``Associates are thrown into a big maelstrom and asked to sink
or swim,'' Sender says. ``And the people at the bottom are
considered disposable.''
</P>
<P>
   The associate's plight was more or less accepted for years, she
says, but the Generation X of the legal profession has begun to
complain, forcing some firms competing for the best students to
respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people grew up with all those concepts of flex time and
part time, notions of fairness and this idea that there's more to
life than a job _ even a job like the law,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the praise heaped on firms like Goulston &AMP; Storrs, some
observers remain skeptical, saying feel-good policies can be little
more than a veneer to business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Firms still have to make money,'' says Mark Kwatcher, of
Kwatcher Legal Placement in Boston. ``You make money by billing
hours. Nobody has the idea that they want to grind up associates,
but it's the reality now. Those economic forces haven't changed.''
</P>
<P>
   And while most young associates are clearly happy to be at
Goulston, at least one attorney at the firm said the
feel-good &UR;  &LR; practice &UR;  &LR; doesn't always measure up to the billing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They make a sincere effort, and that means a lot,'' said the
associate, who asked not to be named. ``But when you get beyond
that, this isn't all that much different than a lot of firms. The
hours are still long. Some of the partners are a huge pain to work
with. And the bottom line, no matter what anybody says, is that to
really make it at the firm you've got to make money for the firm. I
don't know that any amount of policy making can get you around
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Goulston &AMP; Storrs' claim of advancing all or most of
its associates to partnership could one day evaporate for the
simple reason that entrenched partners will be ultimately unwilling
to share profits with an ever-growing group, some observers say.
Even firm officials admit it, though they point out the firm has an
unusually high ratio of 71 partners to 52 associates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want everyone to be successful here,'' says Heroz, the
managing partner. ``But one of the issues is, how many partners can
you have? Is there a limit? If you cut up the pie for more and more
partners, there is. You have to be a successful law firm. To do the
kinds of things we are doing, you have to have economic
well-being.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, prosperity may lie at the heart of the matter, some
observers say. The fact that Boston firms performed so well on the
American Lawyer survey has as much to do with the local economy as
it does with firm policies, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are good right now,'' says Kwatcher. ``It's Boston's
time to shine. The firms are busy. They're doing interesting work.
But that's going to change. When times get a little worse, we'll
see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Moody, the second-year associate, says she has
already worked on important cases. She has burned midnight oil, but
she also has time to travel with her boyfriend and spend summer
weekends on the Cape. She occupies an office with a harbor view,
where on one recent evening she could gaze at ferries placidly
churning toward the mist of a rust-colored sunset. ``It's probably
not nirvana,'' she says. ``But it's a very good place to be.''

 By JERRY ACKERMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; You dress right, you stand straight, you maintain good eye
contact. In short, you think you make a good impression in your
work. But first, can you answer this question?
</P>
<P>
   While you are talking in your office with Mr. Wallet, a
potential customer, the company president stops by. Being polite,
you introduce the customer to the boss: ``Mr. Bigg, I would like
you to meet Mr. Wallet.'' Was this correct?
</P>
<P>
   The answer (you'll find it below) isn't readily apparent. But if
you came close, it may be because your company is one of many at
which on-the-job etiquette is taking on new importance.
</P>
<P>
   From the hospitality world _ where niceness is what they sell _
to the combative world of finance and the often-geeky environs of
technology, managers and executives are seeking help to boost
civility in everyday business situations.
</P>
<P>
   Promoting office dress standards, teaching how to wipe your lips
or offer a toast at a formal lunch, encouraging telephone manners _
all are part of what consultants who give such lessons call a
back-to-basics movement that is touching top executives, front-line
sales personnel, and college students.
</P>
<P>
   The decline of such education in schools, the vanishing family
supper hour where the art of small talk was once learned, an
increasingly entrepreneurial business world where social skills
fade as profit pressures grow, and the societal turmoil two decades
ago that thumbed its nose at courtesy _ all have helped create a
boom market today for the sale of savoir faire.
</P>
<P>
   And, as the corporate sales staff at the Boston Harbor Hotel
learned recently, good table manners and conversational style can
be critical in closing a deal. This is especially true, Boston
etiquette consultant Rosanne Thomas told her class, if your client
is from a culture where such skills are held in high esteem and
talking business at a meal is considered rude. Even the food and
wine, fine though they might be, is secondary, she said. ``A
business function ... is really all about building a relationship.
As they say, you sing for your supper.''
</P>
<P>
   Some, of course, might argue that etiquette, carried to an
extreme, interferes with constructive dialogue. Stephen P.
Steinberg, executive director of the Penn National Commission on
Society, Culture and the Community at the University of
Pennsylvania, sees irony in this: ``We want comfort in our
interactions with other people, but at the same time we don't want
to lose the energy and creativity of those interactions.''
</P>
<P>
   And those in business who embrace and promote better behavior
say they do so because everything an individual does, good or bad,
reflects not only on the person but his or her company.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, business has become more relaxed in recent
years,'' laments Jennifer Schaeffner, a vice president at FIS
Securities Inc., the Boston mutual-funds subsidiary of Fleet
Financial Group. Hoping to dent this trend, she recently hired
Thomas to offer etiquette advice to her 22 Massachusetts sales
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be valuable for us to all go back and see
what the basics are,'' Schaeffner said. &UR;  &LR; ``I think it will help
standardize the kind of behavior we want our people to display, so
that if you went to any of our offices ... you would see similar
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   The curriculum ran from the correct way to introduce one's self
and to shake hands to the role that seemingly idle conversation
plays in helping people understand each other.
</P>
<P>
   On handshakes, Thomas's rule is to keep your thumb straight up
and you can't miss. As for small talk, avoid business topics until
it's time to get serious; don't discuss sex, politics, or religion,
and don't boast about your kids.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion was covered, too, although this group, crisply dressed
and clearly at ease in their Financial District setting, hardly
needed it. They roared with laughter at a slide Thomas showed of a
man wearing a short-sleeve dress shirt in an office setting _ OK in
Arizona, perhaps, but a no-no in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   They marveled, though, at the intricacies involved at making a
proper introduction.
</P>
<P>
   While a social introduction defers to age and gender, Thomas
says a business situation generally respects status and power. But,
she says, there is one big exception to that rule. It is that, in a
business setting, the customer is the most important person. Thus,
the introduction in the example at the top of this story was wrong.
It should have gone this way: ``Mr. Wallet, I would like you to
meet our president, Mr. Bigg.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds silly to say it, but I didn't realize there was a
pecking order and an etiquette to this,'' Erica Feldblum, 35, a
funds representative at Fleet Bank's Prudential Center office, said
later. Shaun Murphy, 29, her counterpart in Waltham, Mass., said
this lesson, and the one about where to wear a nametag, were
eye-openers. ``These are things you usually have to learn on your
own, and it is easy to learn the wrong things,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, 43, operates as Protocol Advisors Inc. She began the
business in 1995, after working in corporate sales for Tiffany &AMP;
Co. There, clients buying gifts for overseas visitors often also
asked for tips on how to impress these people. Thomas, who had made
etiquette a hobby after attending a talk during the early 1980s by
Judith Martin, the ``Miss Manners'' columnist, had answers. She
owns 30 books on the subject and uses libraries and the Internet
for additional research.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas is among those who trace current interest in business
manners to the 1960s and 1970s, when schools stopped teaching such
skills. ``By the late 1980s, the world began to perceive that we
had a whole generation coming into adulthood and positions of power
and who were also understanding that they were not well equipped to
go out into the business world,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Re, who teaches the ``Social Savvy'' classes for children
at Boston's Ritz-Carlton Hotel and is adding classes for adults
this winter, agrees. ``People now in their 40s and 50s, they were
busy with the Vietnam War then, either protesting it or fighting in
it,'' Re said. Now they run corporations and want to make sure they
know they are doing the right thing _ and be sure their employees
can learn, too.
</P>
<P>
   Colleges were early to understand the problem, seeing that their
students didn't know how to make a good impression in a job
interview. Northeastern University, Bentley College, and the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology are among those that offer
short courses, usually voluntary, on etiquette students may never
have learned at home.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Merritt, a literature professor at MIT who acts as the de
facto ``dean'' of the one-day Charm School MIT runs each January,
cites the way students walk. ``I noticed several years ago that MIT
students don't have any style'' when they walk, he said. ``I teach
them walking, strolling, sauntering, and striding _ and then we
climax with the power walk.'' Other classes cover dining manners,
proper behavior in a crowded elevator, and a session called ``How
to Butter Up a Big Shot.''
</P>
<P>
   At NewsEdge Inc. in Burlington, Mass., a provider of customized
business news reports to clients at more than 1,200 companies, an
ongoing program offers employees four communications-based courses
that address etiquette issues from several perspectives.
</P>
<P>
   Employees in a company such as NewsEdge need help to ``round out
the edges'' of their acknowledged technical expertise, Marilyn
Hoyle, the company's vice president for marketing, said. One of her
biggest concerns is their reliance on e-mail, ``which can
exacerbate a bad communication situation,'' Hoyle said.
</P>
<P>
   Grace Andrews, whose Cambridge, Mass. consulting firm, Training
by Design, handles clients from high-tech firms to casinos, runs
part of NewsEdge's program.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews says while firms that institute such courses may boast
altruistic motives, she thinks their real drive is to gain a
competitive edge. ``It all comes down to, `Will they remember me?
Will they do something special for me?' That's how you get the
business,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, who counts Fidelity Investments, Putnam Investments,
State Street Bank &AMP; Trust Co., Deloitte &AMP; Touche LLC, and the New
England Medical Center among her clients, says the need for better
business manners has been made more urgent during the past decade
by rapid globalization of business relations.
</P>
<P>
   She now includes in her curriculum a course titled ``Dining Like
a Diplomat,'' tailored for Americans who do business with
Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   At the recent session for the corporate sales staff at the
Boston Harbor Hotel, Thomas explained the uses for 12 types of
forks, eight kinds of knives, and 12 styles of spoons. She teaches
that, when you set your fork and knife down on the plate, they
should be angled to point to ``the 2 o'clock position'' if you are
only resting between bites. If you put them in ``the 4 o'clock
position,'' she says, that's a signal for an attentive waiter to
quietly take your plate away.
</P>
<P>
   With some difficulty, the students learned that the European
style of dining demands the fork always remain in the left hand and
the knife in the right.
</P>
<P>
   Those at this lunch, while often laughing and joking at such
strict attention to detail, said these lessons all were helpful.
Their work is to convince corporate executives, from both the
United States and abroad, to make the Boston Harbor Hotel their
regular hotel and dining spot in Boston, and meetings over meals
are an important part of these negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   These sales people also often find themselves put on the spot by
clients for etiquette advice. ``Big executives that we sit with
every day are always asking things like, `Which bread is mine?'''
said Andrea Costa, the hotel's advertising and marketing manager.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, says Thomas, at a very formal European-style dinner,
``Bread and butter is not served.''

CREDENTIALS COULD CRAMP YOUR STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the years I have developed an interest in the career of
James Fallowzzz, Big Thinker, media critic, and the recently
cashiered editor of U.S. News &AMP; World Report. Jim is now designing
word processing software for Microsoft (Great ad campaign _ ``Write
like Jim Fallowzzz!'') and, of course, I wish him the best.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who suggest that everything Jim has ever
written, from his ``small-is-beautiful'' defense theories to his
prolix valorizations of the Japanese economy, is dead wrong. But
I've always admired an excellent cover story Fallowzzz wrote for
the Atlantic Monthly in 1985, on the subject of ``credentialism.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he expended 12,639 words to put across his thesis,
Fallowzzz's point was a simple one: Professional mobility in
America had become wholly dependent on academic credentials, at the
expense of our professed meritocratic values. Without a degree, and
preferably an advanced degree, from a societally approved temple of
higher learning, one faced tough slogging in what was then Ronald
Reagan's America.
</P>
<P>
   But even this most convincing of Fallowzzz-izms proves to be
wrong. Events of recent weeks reveal that credentials are out, and
moxie is in. If you say you are qualified, you are qualified!
Right, Mary Bono?
</P>
<P>
   Consider:
</P>
<P>
   _Minnesota's Jesse ``the Governor'' Ventura, has been a
professional wrestler, a motorcyle gang _ sorry, club _ member, a
bodyguard for the Rolling Stones, a Navy SEAL, a talk-show host,
and part-time mayor of Brooklyn Park, (Minn.), population 64,000.
He doesn't have a college degree, and the two men he trounced in
last month's election must be wondering why they bothered pursuing
theirs.
</P>
<P>
   _Irene Saez, a 6-foot-1 strawberry blonde who was Miss Universe
in 1981, may or may not be elected president of Venezuela on
Sunday. In other countries, Ms. Saez might be dismissed as just
another pretty face. But in Venezuela, which has spewed forth four
Miss Universes and four Miss Worlds, her credentials are taken very
seriously indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Saez had shown surprising poll strength against
her principal rival, Hugo Chavez, a former army paratrooper who
tried to overthrow the government in 1992. Now the Associated Press
reports that Saez's campaign is losing momentum as the election
nears. ``Irene should have stayed as beauty queen and never gotten
involved in politics,'' according to some strumpet/waitress
interviewed by the AP. Who cares what she thinks, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   _Superwonderfulgreatguy Tom Hanks sees which way the wind is
blowing. If some bimbo can put up big numbers in Caracas, why not
put Forrest Gump back in the White House? Discussing his political
ambitions with The New Yorker, Hanks initially fell into the
credentialism trap, allowing that he might ``have to know about law
or economics'' to run for office.
</P>
<P>
   Then the penny dropped. He flew on ``Apollo 13.'' He has what it
takes. ``My image is a really good one. I made a nice acceptance
speech on TV a couple of times,'' Hanks told the magazine. ``The
actual ideology that anyone can glean as by my appearances on TV is
that America is good because we are all so different, and
respecting each other is not so hard a thing to do. Not a bad
platform, I suppose, to run for some office.''
</P>
<P>
   Terrific platform, Tom! Arthur the Aardvark for vice president!
</P>
<P>
   It is at this point that the discerning reader might ask: What
credentials are required to become a columnist at the Great
Metropolitan Newspaper? Who knows? A penchant for bowing and
scraping in front of editors doesn't hurt, and a casual familiarity
with the English language is encouraged, but not required. (That's
why God invented the copy desk.)
</P>
<P>
   And that's the irony, gentle reader. You could be doing my job.
But, chances are, I couldn't be doing yours.

AILES INSISTS FOX NEWS IS BALANCED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ask Roger Ailes a question and you get an answer: fast,
colorful, blunt as a punch in the nose.
</P>
<P>
   Ailes was the Republican media strategist whose no-holds-barred
use of television to fashion a ``New Nixon'' was chronicled in Joe
McGinnis's ``The Selling of the President.'' He went on perform
similar services for Presidents Reagan and Bush; it was Ailes who
created the 1988 commercial showing a helmeted Michael Dukakis in a
tank.
</P>
<P>
   Now the 58-year-old Ailes is the chairman of Fox News, which has
been accused, along with its cable rivals CNN and MSNBC, of what
critics might call the Smearing of the President. That is, of
indulging in overkill in their coverage of the Monica Lewinsky/Bill
Clinton story.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Ailes isn't buying.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't every day you get a president with a semen-stained
dress,'' Ailes barked Tuesday during an interview. ``It's kind of
an unusual story; you have to give a little credit to the story
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   He conceded, though, that ``there's no question that kind of
story drives ratings, and once the cable networks understand that,
they're all in the hunt.'' And Ailes admitted that the coverage
``was perhaps a little bit overboard,'' though he contended that
Fox News showed restraint at some points.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Ailes said, the network had the story of the cigar
and the dress ``several weeks'' before the competition, but chose
not to broadcast the stories because ``the sourcing had to be
exceptionally strong for that kind of story.''
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of Fox News, Ailes oversees both the Fox News
Channel on cable and the limited amount of news programming (``Fox
Files,'' ``Fox News Sunday'') on the Fox broadcast network. His
political conservatism, along with that of Fox owner Rupert
Murdoch, has prompted some critics to label Fox News as primarily a
conduit for right-wing views. Its zest in covering the White House
scandal has rekindled those suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   But Ailes insists that the aim of the network, whose slogan is
``We report. You decide,'' is to present both sides of stories.
``Between 59 and 68 percent of the American people believe the
media is biased, and most believe it's biased toward the left,'' he
said. ``We say we're not going to spin the story for you in the
middle of the newscast, and that hit a nerve with the American
people, because they know they've been getting spun.''
</P>
<P>
   The all-news cable networks have used the Lewinsky story to
dramatically boost their ratings, though their numbers are still
small compared to the broadcast networks (and Fox News Channel is
third-ranked among the 24-hour cable channels).
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, they have muscled in on territory the broadcast
networks once had to themselves, giving rise to speculation that
one of the broadcasters might eventually get out of the news
business. Ailes envisions such a scenario. ``The network news
divisions, they're struggling to justify costs to support a
half-hour program,'' he said. ``They're living off their magazine
shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of which: Does Ailes worry that the current glut of
newsmagazines will jeopardize ratings for ``Fox Files,'' the
newsmagazine that kicks off a new season tomorrow at 9 p.m.?
</P>
<P>
   ``I am worried about it,'' Ailes said, no trace of worry in his
voice. ``I just hope that the rest of them cancel theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Having decided to broadcast ``Fox Files'' each week from Grand
Central Terminal in New York City _ through which nearly half a
million people pass daily _ is Ailes concerned about potential
disruptions? Au contraire. ``If it happens, we'll shoot it and air
it,'' he said blithely.
</P>
<P>
   More seriously, the decision to locate ``Fox Files'' in Grand
Central was driven by his desire to ``get the show down to the
street level of real people,'' Ailes said. ``We were looking for a
way to do this without an anchor desk, because so many of these
shows are locked in studios.''
</P>
<P>
   Hosted by Catherine Crier and Jon Scott, ``Fox Files'' debuted
last summer, when it pulled a younger audience (average age: 36)
than NBC's ``Dateline'' or CBS's ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ailes reacted nonchalantly to a report Tuesday in Daily Variety
that rival MSNBC is close to signing a lucrative new deal with
nationally syndicated radio host Don Imus, despite efforts by Fox
News Channel and CNN to woo him away. The deal would more than
double the license fee that MSNBC now pays annually to simulcast
``Imus in the Morning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said to Don Imus from time to time, `If they don't treat
you well, come on over here,' but we've never had any official
negotiations with them whatsoever,'' said Ailes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told by one of their lawyers that every time they used
my name their price went up. They learned their lesson from Geraldo
Rivera; Geraldo has been able to buy a few homes thanks to
mentioning my name.''
</P>
<P>
   Last November, around the time Rivera's contract was up for
renewal at CNBC, Ailes made a hefty offer to lure him to Fox News.
NBC, which owns CNBC, quickly countered with an offer for much more
money and exposure for Rivera, which kept him at the Peacock
Network.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people at NBC are now asking me to be their agent,''
cracked Ailes.

TODAY'S SCOUTS PREPARE FOR THE WILDERNESS _ AND THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lord Baden-Powell, who taught the original Boy Scouts how to
guide strangers out of a London fog, had no compass for the murky
wilderness of the Internet. He knew about treating snake bites,
rigging lean-tos and avoiding poisonous toadstools. He didn't know
from black-tar heroin, AIDS, or on-line predators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be prepared _ for any old thing,'' Baden-Powell urged his
scouts in 1907. These days, that means being home alone, minding
siblings, fending off sexual abuse, and dealing with weird instant
messages from strangers on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the `new things' highlighted in the latest edition of
the Boy Scout Handbook, now available across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the old things _ camping and hiking skills, first aid,
personal hygiene, citizenship _ can still be found in the
handbook's 472 pages, which have been reorganized and streamlined
for easier use and printed on recycled and biodegradable paper.
</P>
<P>
   But a new section, ``Prepared for Life,'' offers frank advice
about cyberspace, sex, alcohol, drugs, and peer pressure. ``That's
one thing that came from the scouts themselves,'' says David
Setzer, vice chairman of the Boy Scouts of America's national
committee. ``They wanted something that dealt with the tough
problems they see every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The original scout handbook, published in 1911, was all about
surviving in the outdoors, about woodcraft and campcraft. Scouts
learned how to track and signal, how to tell the deadly Amanita
phalloides from the tasty Agaricus campestris, how to stop a
runaway horse and kill a mad dog.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th edition, the first revision since 1990, still teaches
boys from 11 through 18 how to find true north, make a splint, fold
Old Glory and cook a one-pot stew over a campfire. It also includes
tips on sexual responsibility, avoiding molesters, caring for young
children, and appreciating diversity. (But it avoids mentioning
homosexuals, whom the BSA bans. On Monday the US Supreme Court
denied a gay former Scout leader's challenge to the policy.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The new handbook continues the emphasis on the Scout oath and
Scout law and Scout values,'' says Setzer. ``But it does it for
21st-century kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The BSA understands that the America of Norman Rockwell (who
painted the cover for four &UR;  &LR; of the previous 10 handbook editions)
has vanished. Scouting's WASPy suburban image is evolving. A
quarter of the membership now comes from minority groups, most of
them from inner cities.
</P>
<P>
   Today's scout is likely to come home to an empty house after
school and may have to serve as surrogate parent in a fatherless
home. He doesn't need to go off into the woods to find all the
adventure he can handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scouts told us they wanted the handbook to reflect a lot
of other things,'' says Matt Milleson, a Baylor University
sophomore and Eagle Scout who helped with the revision. ``They
wanted not just a guidebook to the outdoors, but a guidebook to
life.''
</P>
<P>
   So the BSA sounded out volunteers and scouts across the country
and formed a 15-member literary review committee that spent nearly
two years reworking the handbook.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't just a bunch of gray-haired guys sitting in a room
putting a book together,'' says Bob Longoria, an Albuquerque
engineering department manager and scoutmaster who worked on the
revision. ``We got a lot of input from young people.''
</P>
<P>
   The scouts said they wanted the handbook (three-quarters of a
million have been printed) to be more durable, more portable, and
decidedly more readable. So the new version has rounded edges, a
stiffer spine, and thousands fewer words.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't want us to give them an encyclopedia,'' says
Setzer. ``They wanted the information brief, right at it. So we've
skinnied it down quite a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   They've also punched it up graphically for the Wired generation
_ bright colors, sharp graphics, pithy advice boxes that jump off
the page _ and lots of white space, just like the BSA Web site
(www.bsa.scouting.org). It's the millennial handbook for the
21st-century boy.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Baden-Powell, who honed his outdoors skills chasing Boers
across the South African veldt in the Victorian age, knew all about
boxing a compass. But he couldn't have found his way around
cyberspace &UR;  &LR; with the North Star pasted to his forehead.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
EXCERPTS FROM THE NEW HANDBOOK &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Be prepared,'' the age-old Scout motto, has an updated meaning
for the 21st-century boy. Excerpts from the revised Boy Scout
Handbook:  &QL; 
 &QL; 
--Sexual abuse &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No one should live in fear of abuse. You do not have to let
people touch you in ways you find uncomfortable. If you are ever
asked to do something you know is wrong, you have the right to
refuse. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most sexual abuse can be prevented if young people know and
follow these three R's: recognize, resist, and report &QL; 
 &QL; 
--Using the Internet &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _Don't respond to messages or Web sites that make you feel
uncomfortable or that you know are meant only for adults. If you
come across information or images that you don't understand, talk
about it with your parent or guardian.
</P>
<P>
   _Don't give out personal information, including your address,
telephone number, photograph, school name or your parents' work
address or telephone number.
</P>
<P>
   _Never agree to meet anyone who has contacted you on-line unless
your parent or guardian comes with you. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Caring for younger children &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _Keep children out of danger areas.
</P>
<P>
   _Lock the doors. Don't open them for anyone unless you know the
person.
</P>
<P>
   _After the children are in bed, check every half hour to be sure
they are all right.
</P>
<P>
   _Stay awake until a parent or guardian returns &QL; 
 &QL; 
--Drugs
</P>
<P>
   Drugs are chemicals that alter the body's chemistry. When you
are sick, drugs given by a doctor can help you get well.
Unfortunately, many young people use illegal drugs that don't come
from a physician. Marijuana, cocaine and crack, codeine,
depressants, LSD, heroin, inhalants, and steroids have powerful
effects on the mind as well as the body. &QL;

VAN SANT DRAINS `PSYCHO'; FOX'S SEVEN-YEAR BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The glossies are going quite cuckoo for the new ``Psycho,'' Gus
Van Sant's postmodern appropriation _ uh, replication _ uh,
reproduction _ uh, oh whatever of Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 horror
flick. While most directors are reimagining (read: massacre-ing)
classic movies like ``Diabolique'' or ``Sabrina,'' Van Sant sees
himself taking the Hollywood high road by staying as loyal as
possible to Joseph Stefano's original script and Hitchcock's own
setups. He says his ``Psycho,'' which opens on Friday, is not one
of those cynical remakes, the devilish breed of movie that assures
studio marketing departments of name recognition (Suit No.1: ``I
can just picture the blood-down-the-drain shot in the ads.'' Suit
No.2: ``In bloody color!!'') Van Sant's ``Psycho'' is a service to
filmmakers and audiences, he tells the Dec./Jan.  &UR; Movieline &LR; :
``It's a good thing to reestablish the importance of a work like
`Psycho' or `Citizen Kane.' Why not redo in color a brilliant,
successful film nobody's seeing because it's in black and white?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, a remake is a remake is a remake, no? We're in the throes
of a tireless Re-movie Era, where sequels and remakes and now
replicas are easier to produce than riskier new visions. Rather
than revitalize cinema, re-movies erode the public value of, and
taste for, original efforts. Let's face it, Van Sant got a $25
million budget from Universal because his ``Psycho'' is a neat way
to merge Hitchcock's brand-name familiarity with the popularity of
horror-movie series like ``Scream'' and ``I Know What You Did Last
Summer.'' It's bound to be a hit.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, Van Sant has made a name for himself as one of the
more personal of American directors with stubbornly unformulaic
films like ``My Own Private Idaho'' and ``Drugstore Cowboy.'' That
he would choose to borrow an entire movie, and introduce the rough
beast of replication to a Hollywood mindset already bent on
duplication, is not a particularly encouraging move. Especially
since his Oscar-winning box-office hit, ``Good Will Hunting,''
gives Van Sant more power than ever to beat back the claws of
studio hawks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Entertainment Weekly  &LR; for Dec. 4 has a good overview of the
making of the movie, and the December  &UR; Interview  &LR; has a superficial
chat with Van Sant. But Movieline's interview is the most
interesting of the ``Psycho'' pieces, with Stephen Rebello, author
of a book on Hitchcock's ``Psycho,'' prompting Van Sant to be
honest by asking some good questions. Rebello also gets Van Sant to
disclose the names of the actors he initially eyed, including
Robert Sean Leonard, Jeremy Davies, Henry Thomas, Matt Damon, Ben
Affleck, and Leonardo DiCaprio (of course), for the Norman Bates
role that finally went to Vince Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GQ  &LR; for December has a profile of Vaughn that portrays him,
like Bates, as not just a little unusual. After marking Vaughn as
one of the new breed of leading men, along with Damon and Affleck,
writer Lucy Kaylin goes out drinking with him, an adventure that
finds Vaughn's voice becoming ``increasingly redneck'' as he
exaggerates the working-class aspects of his youth and spouts on
about America: ``I love this country; I really do. I know she can
be a harsh mistress, but she's my lady, the U.S.A., and I love her
unconditionally.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The saddest cover story of the week, though, goes to  &UR; People &LR; ,
which broke the news that Michael J. Fox has Parkinson's disease. A
TV actor for most of his career, Fox has the sort of special
intimacy with the public that comes from appearing in their homes
once a week or more. Why has Fox, whose ``Spin City'' is waging a
Wednesday night ratings war, finally come forward with the
heart-rending story of his tremors and facial stiffness after seven
years battling the disease? ``This box I had put everything into
kind of expanded to a point where it's difficult to lug around,''
Fox says. ``What's inside the box isn't inhibiting me. It's the box
itself. I think I can help people by talking. I want to help myself
and my family.''

THE TIME IS RIGHT FOR HOLYFIELD, LEWIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Don King stood behind a podium at the Parker House for
nearly two hours and did what he does best. He emoted.
</P>
<P>
   King was in Boston as part of a whirlwind trip across America
designed to kick-start the promotion of the heavyweight unification
fight between World Boxing Association-International Boxing
Federation champion Evander Holyfield and his World Boxing Council
counterpart, Lennox Lewis. The hope is that on March 13, those two
will settle once and for all who's the baddest man on the planet,
although King was content to argue that he already knows who that
is.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, he declared it is his man. Knowing King,
regardless of who wins, it will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holyfield has proven beyond a doubt he's a believe-it-or-not
Ripley,'' King said of the man he has promoted since Holyfield made
Mike Tyson null and void. ``This is going to be a giant fight
between two giants ready to do battle. It is a fight that will do
giant numbers. Giant numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is why King, Holyfield, Lewis, and their
various associates and business partners were in Boston. It is why
they were in Washington Tuesday as well and New York the day before
that, and why they'll be in Chicago and Los Angeles before the end
of the week. They are in these places to try to ensure that the big
numbers on pay-per-view and at the box office at New York's Madison
Square Garden appear on March 13, as surely as the two champions
will.
</P>
<P>
   This fight, like all prizefights, is about the money first, but
there is something more here. Holyfield agreed to risk all the
hard-earned respect he has won over the past few years for a $20
million payday and the chance to leave boxing in the
not-too-distant future as the undisputed heavyweight champion.
Lewis agreed to accept a mere $9 million for the same opportunity,
knowing that for him, the chance to define himself by such a moment
was fast slipping away.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're all done fighting, nobody remembers how much money
you fought for,'' Lewis said while reclining in a small easy chair
outside his hotel room last night. ``They remember your
accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed a fight like this. I don't know why Holyfield decided
to take the chance and fight me. Maybe he feels he can beat me now.
But it was important for my career to fight him. The others (Tyson,
Riddick Bowe, Michael Moorer, and George Foreman) wouldn't fight
me. If I want to be remembered in boxing, I had to fight one of
these guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like I was marching up a hill and there was always an
iron gate in front of me. I've been knocking on it and beating on
it and punching at it. Now, all of a sudden, it's opened. Not
willingly, but it's opened.''
</P>
<P>
   The gate was opened for a fight the boxing public has wanted for
some time now for an assortment of reasons, many of them financial.
Once King lost control of Tyson, there was no longer a reason for
him to hold off Lewis in the knowledge that Holyfield could make
more money against Tyson with less worry.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, King's position at Showtime, the cable network that
has broadcast his fights for the past eight years, grew more
tentative once he no longer promoted Tyson, so negotiating a
Holyfield-Lewis fight with Showtime's cable rival, HBO, provided
King with the kind of leverage he has made it his business to
possess through most of the past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   The same applied to Holyfield. With Tyson suspended and the
titles Holyfield carries having been adequately defended from the
riffraff of the sport already, he found few other obstacles worth
wasting his time on. At this stage of his career, Holyfield has one
aim: He wants to unify the heavyweight title one last time and
retire without losing another fight. To do that, he knew he must
first beat Lewis, which he is pretty well convinced is not akin to
climbing Mount Everest without bottled oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lennox Lewis is a good fighter,'' Holyfield said, ``but my
goal has always been to be the best, not to share that with
anybody. I appreciate the opportunity Lennox gave me to show size
don't make a difference. The question isn't, will I win? The
question is, how bad am I going to beat him? He has to make a
mistake because I'll make him make a mistake. If he's aggressive,
he'll just go faster.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Lewis, it is obvious that Holyfield is his last, best
hope at boxing immortality, and Lewis was willing to pay a price
for a shot at it, if one considers a $9 million payday paying a
price.
</P>
<P>
   He was willing to take this risk for the same reason Holyfield
is: because he sees no real risk, which is not the same as saying
he sees no danger waiting for him March 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a difficult fight,'' Lewis said. ``I expect we'll
both have some trouble at times, but I had a dream after we signed
for this. I'd won all the belts and had them in front of me. I
picked them all up and pressed them together, and they melted into
one belt. This is my chance. This is my destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, it can't be everybody's destiny to unify the
heavyweight title March 13. On that night, there can be only one
winner.
</P>
<P>
   Plus Don King, of course.

JOANNE DOW WALKS AMONG TRACK'S BEST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers
can make individual purchases by calling 212-556-4204 or -1927.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  It was the summer of 1994. Joanne Dow and her husband Tim
were on their way home from Niagara Falls, where the novice had
done well in her first major racewalking competition. There, she
caught the eye of one of the sport's top coaches, who told her she
had the potential to be among the best in the country.
</P>
<P>
   All she had to do was commit.
</P>
<P>
   From the time she mentioned the topic at a rest area outside of
Buffalo _ ``Do you think we can do this?'' _ their conversation
carried them past the Finger Lakes and Oneida Indian Reservation,
along the peaceful Mohawk River to the billboards of Albany before
taking them home to the Granite State. How can I find more time to
train? How will it affect the children? Can we really make this
work?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget driving down that highway,'' said Dow last
week, down from her Bedford, N.H., home to do an photo shoot for
Adidas. ``When we come to a decision like that, we take it very
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   So seriously that Dow's outstanding 1998 campaign earned her a
nomination for this year's Jesse Owens Award, given by USA Track &AMP;
Field to the sport's outstanding male and female athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I laughed so hard I had tears in my eyes,'' said Dow, 34, of
learning she was nominated. ``I was shocked. I'm still shocked.
This has been their career, for most of them, their whole lives.
It's just me, doing my thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, her thing has included:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; Setting a new US record for 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) of 1
hour, 34 minutes, 46 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; A victory in 10K at the US outdoor nationals.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; A bronze medal at the Goodwill Games, the first-ever medal by
a US racewalker at the event.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; Becoming the first American woman to win the Pan Am Cup.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; Seeing her photo in Sports Illustrated last month as one of
the ``Faces in the Crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't totally surprise me,'' said Tim of his wife's rapid
rise. ``I don't think it's peaked yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Owens award was first given in 1981, winners have
included Joan Benoit Samuelson, Florence Griffith Joyner, and Lynn
Jennings. This year, Dow _ the first racewalker ever nominated _
was up against Regina Jacobs, the new American record-holder at
5,000 meters; Jearl Miles-Clark, 400- and 800-meter runner; Connie
Price-Smith, discus and shot putter; Tisha Waller, high jumper; and
Marion Jones, who was undefeated this year at 100 and 200 meters
and nearly so in the long jump.
</P>
<P>
   Dow didn't think for a moment that she would win, and she
didn't: Jones was announced Tuesday as the female honoree for the
second straight year. (Those sentiments were expressed more
directly by Dow's daughter Hannah. When the 8-year-old heard her
idol Jones was among the nominees, she declared, ``Well, I guess we
know who's going to win that!'')
</P>
<P>
   But the mere fact of Dow's nomination is a victory of sorts,
especially for the sport. ``It's really a big breakthrough for
racewalking,'' said Mark Fenton, Dow's coach and editor-at-large of
Walking magazine. ``It moves a racewalker into the category of
quote unquote real athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it's at least partly because Dow was a real athlete
before she took up racewalking that her progress has been so
phenomenal. A serious swimmer since age 9, Dow twice went to NCAA
nationals on her University of New Hampshire relay team, and had
worked for years as a fitness instructor. She had the genetic
gifts, the endurance, and willingness to push herself to her limits
after discovering what they might be. Always a walker, Dow
discovered racewalking while she was teaching fitness walking
classes at a Manchester health club. It didn't take long to feel
the potential.
</P>
<P>
   After she and her husband committed themselves, Dow buckled
down. ``She became a student of the sport,'' said Fenton. ``She was
willing to read and learn, go to clinics. She took off like a
rocket in the first year of her career.''
</P>
<P>
   But the rocket soon crashed. Barely a year after getting into
the sport, Dow was out of it, felled by a torn hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   ``She may have overtaxed herself,'' said Fenton, explaining that
Dow's superb aerobic conditioning allowed her to push herself
faster than her muscles were ready to carry her.
</P>
<P>
   Dow was crushed. ``I was getting faster and faster and faster,''
she said, her eyes dancing at the joy of it. ``I was just pounding
myself. A day off for me was teaching a class.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a year before Dow was back on track, during which she
gave the 1996 Olympic Trials a go despite the injury and hooked up
with Fenton to help assure the 2000 trials would be more
meaningful. The only thing he has to drive her to do, he said, is
stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I tell you to knock it off, she has to knock it off,'' he
said. Rest means rest. Take a day off means take a day off, not
it's OK to do an easy six miles to stay loose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reaped the rewards this year of having someone like him, who
knows what he's doing,'' said Dow.
</P>
<P>
   All along, it seems, the timing has been right. Her children _
Hannah and 6-year-old Tim _ always seemed to be at the right age
for her next step in racewalking, and this year both are in school
full-time, which allows for training after dawn. The main event in
women's racewalking has just grown from 10K to 20K, which suits her
endurance and levels the playing field in that everyone, even the
most experienced racewalkers in the world, have to cope with the
new distance. She's been healthy long enough to really test herself
in 1999, leading up to an Olympic year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It absolutely came at the right time: agewise, lifewise, what
I could give to it,'' she said. ``I don't feel like I've reached my
potential yet.''
</P>
<P>
   If true, the journey that began at a rest stop outside of
Buffalo could end up on the medal stand in Sydney.

<P>
   The issue is completely irresolvable, which is not to say that
things can't, and certainly shouldn't, be better.
</P>
<P>
   There will never, ever be satisfaction with professional sports
officials, in this country or any other. (Would you like to be
refereeing a big soccer game in Brazil?) That's never, as in
N-E-V-E-R. Not today. Not tomorrow. Not after the millennium. Not
on the Twelfth of Never.
</P>
<P>
   Never.
</P>
<P>
   We must start with that premise and then we must understand why
that premise will never change. It will never change because people
are fallible and because they are essentially untrustworthy.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, people make mistakes and people will cheat if
given a remote opportunity to do so. Put those two things together
and all the electronic help in the world will not give us perfectly
officiated games.
</P>
<P>
   Ever.
</P>
<P>
   It always amuses me when people forget that all our games are
inherently flawed to some degree. Until very recently, we as a
society silently accepted that fact, even if few of us have ever
articulated it. We accepted that mistakes would be made, that
somebody's got to win and somebody's got to lose, and that, for
better or worse, the refs would always be a part of the package.
</P>
<P>
   But that's all changed now. All of a sudden, we want perfection
from everybody.
</P>
<P>
   It's not good enough to be a good team. You must be a
championship team. It's not good enough to be a very good player.
You've just got to have that ring to validate your greatness.
(Think Charles Barkley and Karl Malone.) It's no longer good enough
for a football coach to win 10 games just about every year and have
his team in the playoffs far more often than not. You've got to win
the Super Bowl. (Think Marty Schottenheimer.)
</P>
<P>
   Officials are very important, and they have a lot to do with the
outcome of almost any game. Take basketball, for example. I have
always believed that an official has the value of a good, if not
necessarily great, player. Officials determine who will play and
how the game will be played, both highly important matters. People
who place officials in a neutral category are simply ignorant. How,
for example, can a home plate umpire not be important? (Think Eric
Gregg and Livan Hernandez, or any plate ump and Tom Glavine.)
</P>
<P>
   Officials are a significant part of the package. You might say
we can't live with 'em and can't live without 'em, with an emphasis
on the latter theory.
</P>
<P>
   Now the spotlight is on NFL officials. Are they really worse
than ever? I seriously doubt it. Colleague Ron Borges raises a very
good point when he cites expansion as having a deleterious effect
on officiating, but I think that is only a minor part of the
current controversy and I respectfully submit an alternative view.
I believe we make far more out of every officiating decision than
we did 20 years ago, not to mention 50 years ago. You think there
weren't debatable calls being made every Sunday when Sammy Baugh,
Bulldog Turner, Crazy Legs Hirsch, Chuck Bednarik, Jim Brown, Big
Daddy Lipscomb, and Bob Lilly played? Dream on.
</P>
<P>
   Society is infinitely more demanding now than it was in times
past. We are infected with an entitlement mentality in every walk
of life. None of us is immune to this thought process in everyday
life, so why should it be any different in our athletic pursuits?
Officials are now being caught in the crossfire for many reasons,
starting with the financial ramifications of so many decisions. At
the base of it all, I believe, is the growing assumption that the
man owes this call to me because, well, I'm me and we're us.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball, basketball, hockey, and football _ our clear Big 4
_are all very difficult to administer. Can we all agree on this
basic point? Asking people to be precise to the quarter-inch on
balls and strikes is absurd. Deciding what's allowable contact and
what's not allowable contact under the boards in basketball is
capricious. Making a judgment on the severity of hockey's
minute-by-minute minor mayhem is laughable. Football? When isn't
there holding on a play?
</P>
<P>
   Throw in the fair/foul issue in baseball, the
who-knocked-it-out-of-bounds issue in basketball, the
was-he-in-the-crease-or-wasn't-he issue in hockey, and the one I
consider the granddaddy of all imprecise judgments _ namely,
spotting the football when there has been a 15-body pileup _ and
you've got a recipe for both confusion and error. It's inherent.
There is nothing anyone can do to make these sports easy to
officiate.
</P>
<P>
   These games would be difficult to officiate even if the
participants were scrupulously honest and completely well
intentioned. The opposite is true, as we all know. Even the sainted
Christy Mathewson was never heard to say, ``Mr. Klem, I know you
think that was a strike I just threw, but it seemed to me it was 3
inches outside, so I now ask you to make it a ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Or how about this: When was the last time Rev. Reggie White
picked himself up after sacking a quarterback, walked over to the
nearest official, and demanded he be given a penalty because he was
offside?
</P>
<P>
   In the 19th century, baseball games were handled by one umpire.
Players would take advantage of his occasional preoccupation with
other matters to run from first to third straight across the
diamond, skipping the irritating necessity of going to third base
via second. Does anyone doubt they'd still be doing it today if we
had only one overworked official?
</P>
<P>
   The new cry is to make NFL officials full-time employees of the
league. In three decades of professional activity, I have never
heard a more irrelevant proposal. There is one game a week. There
is no justification imaginable to make these people spend six days
to prepare for one game. You'd think they aren't trained. They're
trained, all right. You'd also think they, like Dorothy's
Scarecrow, lacked a brain. An examination of the officiating roster
reveals 13 people with a title of CEO/president/owner/executive
director/chairman of the board and 17 who work or have worked in
academia. That doesn't count the vice presidents, managing
directors, analysts, and the like.
</P>
<P>
   I can understand why the Pete Carrolls of the world think that
since everyone else in the league is employed full-time, it would
dignify the profession if the officials were likewise under
permanent employment, but they are making more out of this than
they should. This is not the time to overreact because of a very,
very unfortunate coin flip _ explain to me how that one would have
been avoided if Phil Luckett, a computer program analyst, had been
a full-time NFL employee _ and a few other regrettable calls have
been scrutinized, rescrutinized, and ultrascrutinized, just because
we can.
</P>
<P>
   Should there be replay? Maybe. OK, probably. (Don't for one
second think replay will be a panacea for any one of these four
sports.) Should all leagues strive at all times to weed out obvious
incompetents among officials? Absolutely. That's simple common
sense.
</P>
<P>
   Do anything you want as long as you recognize that all these
enterprises will forever be flawed. There is no such thing as a
perfect game and there is no such thing as a perfect person.
</P>
<P>
   I don't see why these things are so difficult to understand.
</P>

HOLY CROSS HAS ITS EYE ON TOURNAMENT PRIZE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since Holy Cross is hosting the fourth annual ECAC women's
basketball holiday tournament this weekend, the team is trying hard
to forget Monday's loss to the University of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to press and will probably try to do on a smaller
scale what Connecticut did to us,'' said coach  &UR; Bill Gibbons  &LR; of
the 107-56 defeat that left the Crusaders 2-3.
</P>
<P>
   Holy Cross's opponent in the opener Saturday at 1 p.m. is Rider,
which is 2-1 in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference. Seton Hall
(2-3), which finished fifth in the Big East last year, faces Brown
(2-2) at 3 p.m. The consolation and championship games will be
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   All the games will be at Holy Cross's Hart Center. ``So it's
definitely on our agenda to win it this year,'' Gibbons said. ``We
want to win on our home turf.''
</P>
<P>
   Holy Cross has hosted the tournament for the past two years,
finishing second both times.
</P>
<P>
   The Crusaders are led by 6-foot-1-inch forward  &UR; Amy O'Brien  &LR; of
Worcester, a hometown favorite as well as the top returning scorer
in the country (26.1 points per game) and Patriot League Player of
the Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's our go-to player, then we have two solid guards who
always make something happen,'' said Gibbons, referring to  &UR; Anne
Kinne &LR;  and  &UR; Lara Marcsisin &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Rider features a fast-break, 3-point-oriented attack led by
guard  &UR; Iris Beistline &LR; , who connected on 66 threes last season.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is led by senior guards  &UR; Vita Redding  &LR; and  &UR; Julie Amato &LR; 
and forward  &UR; Kate Veronneau &LR; , who was 1996-97 Ivy Rookie of the
Year.
</P>
<P>
   Seton Hall is a young team with just two returning players _ 6-2
forward  &UR; Danielle Davis  &LR; and 6-1 forward  &UR; Starr Fuller &LR; , who
graduated from Jeremiah E. Burke High School in Boston. Fuller has
had two double-doubles this year and is the team's leading
rebounder with 7.8 per game.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets, priced at $6 for adults and $3 for students, and can be
purchased the day of the game or by calling 508-793-2573.

Wellesley in Final Four
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wellesley volleyball coach  &UR; Dorothy Webb  &LR; has conflicting
feelings going into the NCAA Final Four Division 3 semifinals this
weekend. She's excited, but with trepidation.
</P>
<P>
   Wellesley, which cruised to a 36-0 rec-ord this season, has not
lost a match since bowing to Wisconsin in last year's NCAA
quarterfinals. The school's first opponent in the Final Four, which
begins Friday at Juniata College in Huntington, Pa., is Central
College (35-2) of Pella, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very, very strong,'' Webb said, ``much stronger than
any of the teams we've seen this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The average height on Wellesley's team is 5-8. Webb estimates
that the Central College women average 5-11.
</P>
<P>
   Wellesley is led by a trio of Regional All-Americans: senior
 &UR; Katy &LR;   &UR; Antypas &LR;  and juniors  &UR; Tiffany Fehr  &LR; and  &UR; Allison &LR; 
 &UR; Schnitzer &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Even though the team has been practicing, it hasn't played a
game since it beat SUNY-Cortland the weekend before last. ``So I
think we're really ready to play,'' Webb said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Wellesley faces Central College at 5 p.m. and Juniata
squares off against California-San Diego at 8. The championship
game is Saturday night.

CHIEF OFFICIAL EMPHASIZES PERSPECTIVE IN BAD CALLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's an annual event, and one that Jerry Seeman does not look
forward to.
</P>
<P>
   Seeman is senior director of officiating in the National
Football League, and experience tells him that, for at least one
week every year, the bottom falls out with questionable calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going good until last week,'' Seeman said softly,
sounding like a guy who had just been hit by a bus. ``You just hope
it continued the way it was going, and then we hit Week 13.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point his voice trailed off, as if he were dreaming
about what might have been.
</P>
<P>
   Then he added, ``Really, it's always just about three or four
plays a week, out of 2,300 plays, that turn the whole thing. But
when they are big plays, in big games, and mistakes are made, that
is ultimately my responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeman would not address directly the controversial calls in the
Patriots-Bills game or the embarrassing coin flip mistake made on
national television Thanksgiving Day in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we had problems in New England and Detroit and they
will be addressed,'' said Seeman. ``We have already changed the way
the coin flip will be done in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to remember here that these officials are human
beings. They are going to make mistakes. On some plays, it is just
impossible to pick up what happened because they go so fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about 15 games a week for all these weeks and you are
bound to miss some. We'd like to take back those four or five plays
each week. But we can't. We have to live with them. That's the
price you pay when you put on a striped shirt in this league. We
all have to deal with the big picture.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a cluster of controversial calls last week.
</P>
<P>
   In Detroit, it was the coin toss before overtime, when the
referee misunderstood the call made by Jerome Bettis and errantly
gave the ball to Detroit, which marched down the field to kick the
winning field goal.
</P>
<P>
   In New England, the Bills appeared to have a victory taken away
from them by two calls at the end of the game _ a completion to
Shawn Jefferson that appeared to be out of bounds, and a pass
interference penalty during a Hail Mary play as time expired.
</P>
<P>
   There also was outrage over questionable calls in the
Oilers-Seahawks game at Seattle, and the Cardinals-Chiefs game at
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   In every instance, critical decisions went in favor of the home
team.
</P>
<P>
   This has triggered a demand for full-time NFL game officials by
many in the sports media.
</P>
<P>
   ``We visited that three or four years ago,'' said Seeman.
Tuesday ``The league set up the Shula Committee to study it. We had
Don Shula, Chuck Noll, Harry Gamble, George Young, myself, and the
commissioner all involved. The consensus was against full-time
officials. We decided that whether the officials are full-time or
not, it is not going to help them making a lightning-quick judgment
call the right way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our emphasis has been on training and educating, finding ways
for our officials to do the best possible job under some tough
circumstances. We have quality officials doing these jobs. They are
well-trained, and well-prepared. And they are dedicated. But it
seems like every year one of these weeks is going to happen, and it
happened last week.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
-------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bills owner Ralph Wilson was still furious over what happened to
his team in New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am more upset about that game in New England than I was
about all four of our Super Bowl losses,'' said Wilson. ``I really
mean that. In the Super Bowls, we were beaten by the other team. In
New England, the officials took the game away from us. We deserved
to win that game, and we didn't get it. I don't know what to do
about it, but I am going to do something. We can't let something
like that happen again to any team. Things much change.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
-------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Steelers coach Bill Cowher is putting the coin flip controversy
behind him and focusing on the Patriots, who visit Pittsburgh
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wish the league would say they made a mistake, and then
get on with it,'' said Cowher. ``Then it would be all over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lost a couple of games lately that we are not used to
losing. Our history is that we win the close games. Then in the
last month, we lost a couple of games that we had the lead going
into the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, I'm pleased with the way our team is playing. I mean
that. I told our team to just keep playing the way we are, and not
get distracted (by losing two tough ones) and we'll start to win.
Offensively, we've had our opportunities and squandered them. Like
the Patriots, we've had some injuries and lost some continuity. But
we're getting some people back and that will help.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing wrong with Jerome Bettis. Some of the problem
with our running game is inconsistency in the offensive line but we
feel like we will play better. Our defense has been solid, our
kicking game good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it. Right now Denver is off in a league of their
own someplace. The rest of us are in a wild scramble to see if we
can win the division or get a wild card spot. Jacksonville, us, New
England, the Jets, the Bills, Miami, it's up for grabs. That's what
I told the team. Because we are all playing each other in these
final four games, all of us have our own destiny in our hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowher remembers his team winning two tough defensive games
against the Patriots at the close of last season, and he expects
the same kind of game in Three Rivers Stadium this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like their defense,'' said Cowher. ``Ty Law is having
a Pro Bowl year. Ted Johnson and Lawyer Milloy are both
exceptional. I'm really impressed by this Chad Eaton kid in the
middle of that defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively, Ben Coates and Terry Glenn are both big weapons.
It seems like our games against the Patriots are always tough, and
come right down to the end.''

Lotto drawing _ a prize that could have totaled $31 million if paid
out over time _ is on parole and has a lengthy criminal history in
Georgia and at least three other states, according to records.
According to state records, new millionaire Kenny Dukes, who also
went by the name David Lee McKenzie, has been in Georgia prisons
four times since the late 1970s and will be on parole until July
2001 for burglary. Records show he also has been charged in

   CARE _ ATLANTA _ Fifty years ago, the relief organization CARE
delivered boxes of food and supplies to grateful Europeans
struggling to recover from the ravages of World War II. But CARE
could never get away today with doing what they did then. Those
boxes contained peanut butter, which was alien to the native
population. They contained candy, which is not nutritious. And they
contained cigarettes, which damage health. Today, aid workers
realize that aid can hurt the people it is intended to help. It can
foster dependency. It can help fuel a war, as in Sudan. Camps that
save refugees can also harbor killers, as in Rwanda. So as CARE
begins work in Honduras and Nicaragua, it is working hard to

<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ This rough-and-tumble democracy has drawn
millions of Taiwanese into a furious 10-day election campaign
revolving around the unspoken issue of how to avoid mainland
China's smothering embrace.
</P>
<P>
   Multi-colored campaign flags festoon every street. Trucks blare
music and rhetoric day and night. Staccato blasts of firecrackers
signal a candidate's arrival to yet another neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Fist-fights break out. Newspapers bemoan ``vote-buying''
estimated at $50 a voter or more.
</P>
<P>
   And doctors, teachers, old folks, laborers -- people of all ages
and pursuits -- walk away from giant political rallies hoarse and
exhilarated from participating in one of the world's most exuberant
democracies.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the Taiwanese will go to the polls on Saturday(Dec.
5) to decide the makeup of the 225-member national legislature, as
well as elect mayors and city council members in their two biggest
cities.
</P>
<P>
   But voters also are defining a course for this demi-nation that
will have world ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Taiwan there is only one issue: Taiwan's national
identity,'' said John Hsieh, political science professor at
National Chengchi University.
</P>
<P>
   This issue has crystallized in the Taipei mayoral race and
expanded the contest far beyond the bounds of traffic jams and
urban renewal. Its outcome is expected to thrust either the ruling
Nationalist Party or the upstart Progressive Party into the
forefront of Taiwan's presidential election in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is sharp: Nationalists support a status quo
looking toward reunification with China if it becomes more
democratic, while the Progressive Party was founded on a call for
eventual Taiwanese independence.
</P>
<P>
   The contest between Nationalist candidate Ma Ying-jeou, 48, and
the Progressives' incumbent Mayor Chen Shui-bian, 47, is the race
most tracked by Beijing's communist leaders, who as recently as
last week threatened to respond with armed force to any steps
toward Taiwanese independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think certainly they (in mainland China) are very much
worried about Mr. Chen's popularity in Taiwan,'' Deputy Foreign
Minister David Lee said in an interview with the Cox News Service.
``They are very worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, a Nationalist, predicted that a failure to win re-election
would be a major setback for Mayor Chen's Progressives, who remain
a minority party on this island of 21 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Overcome in civil war by Chinese communists, the Nationalists
fled here from the mainland in 1949, setting up a dictatorship they
contended was China's real government. The United States withdrew
recognition from Taiwan in 1979 in favor of the communist
government on the mainland, and now Taiwan exists in a nether-world
of lively ``unofficial relations'' with
</P>
<P>
   America that include Washington-approved weapons sales.
</P>
<P>
   It took almost four decades for the Nationalists to finally
relax their grip on Taiwanese politics, giving some voice to more
than two-thirds of the population made up of Malay -descended
Taiwanese natives and other islanders whose families lived here
more than four centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Voters with deep Taiwanese roots such as Chen Di-chou, a wiry
61-year-old, charge the Nationalists are still ``mainlanders'' at
heart. He stood cheering for hours at a Progressive Party rally
last weekend that drew an estimated 100,000 raucous supporters to a
muddy soccer stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an election in Taipei, but the ideology is national,''
said the retired accountant. Over blasts of music and shouts, he
said he is sure the Nationalist candidate Ma ``won't care about
Taiwan'' but will do the bidding of mainland China.
</P>
<P>
   Fears run as strong on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to have war between the two nations across the
strait, said Chao Ching Lo, 35, a cabbie who had plastered
pro-Nationalist flags and stickers on his yellow taxi. ``If
mainland China ever gives up its communist leaders, then we can
reunite.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither side wants to yield the prosperity and democracy setting
this West Virginia-sized island apart from the mainland that looms
only 100 miles away. Yet each side fears the other may lose both.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election will be an important indication of whether a
true opposition party has emerged in Taiwan,'' said longtime
China-watcher Steven Goldstein, professor of government at Smith
College. ``You can't have a solid democratic system unless you have
an opposition party with enough strength to 'throw the rascals out'
sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   A fickle turn of democracy has left Taiwan's Nationalists
fearful of losing power. The heirs of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek
are even accused of being tools of the mainland communists he so
bitterly resisted.
</P>
<P>
   The iron-fisted Chiang, father of the Nationalists and as
autocratic as his mainland communist foe Mao Tse-tung, did not
countenance democracy from the time he took over Taiwan until his
death in 1975. His son Chiang Ching-kuo eventually introduced a
more relaxed atmosphere, and under growing demands for political
rights lifted emergency rule in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Democracy exploded, culminating in a multi-party presidential
election in 1996. The Nationalists have kept control of the
legislature and presidency, but barely.
</P>
<P>
   The Nationalists at times sound worried about the democracy they
unleashed. ``It is awesome. If you have this too heatedly
conducted, then there is the fear that it might lead to something
like anarchy,'' said Fredrick Chien, speaker of the National
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every (election) time in the last 10 years I had that fear,''
Chien said. ``But when the voting day comes, people line up, the
voting percentage is very high, and after casting votes, they just
go home or go out to play.''

A DELUGE OF STYLE BOOKS CATERS TO ALL TASTES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MADELEINE McDERMOTT HAMM 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Astronauts work and live inside cramped, high-tech
space capsules packed with computers and controls. But their houses
on Earth can look like Southern plantations, Arts &AMP; Crafts
bungalows, even French chateaux.
</P>
<P>
   One might live in a converted warehouse loft and fill it with a
mix of machine-modern and flea-market finds. Another might choose a
high-rise apartment stylishly decorated with antiques and Oriental
rugs. Never in our history has interior design been so diverse, so
ready to take the best of the past, blend it with the present and
embrace the future.
</P>
<P>
   The deluge of new design books this season reflects these
wide-ranging interests. No matter what style you favor, whether you
are interested in history or decorating advice, there's probably a
book about it. To review the best of the new books, we have divided
them into five categories: decorating insight, styles, small
spaces, design history and cultural history.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Decorating insight &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do some people insist on neat, tidy rooms, while other
people tend to pile their stuff all over tables, chairs and floors?
Why do some folks crave airy rooms with curtainless windows, while
others are more comfortable in cozy quarters with cushions and
drapery all around?''
</P>
<P>
   Because, explains Judy George in her excellent new book, ``The
Domain Book of Intuitive Home Design'' (Clarkson Potter, $30), we
tend to decorate according to our personality types. George, an
interior designer who created and runs 23 Domain stores on the East
Coast, identifies four personality profiles and explains each one.
</P>
<P>
   A quiz lets the reader decide if he is a Visionary, an Artisan,
an Idealist or an Adventurer, or perhaps a blend of two. George
says that while the book offers decorating ideas, images and
inspiration, ``it also seeks to promote understanding of ourselves
and others ... ultimately, to empower readers to create home
environments that cradle their true selves.''
</P>
<P>
   This is one design book you'll want to read, discuss and share.
</P>
<P>
   ``Open Your Eyes _ 1,000 Simple Ways to Bring Beauty Inside Your
Home &AMP; Life'' (William Morrow, $28) is interior designer Alexandra
Stoddard's 20th book. It tells the reader how to enhance visual
awareness and create a home reflecting individual tastes and sense
of beauty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homestyling: Contrasts in Design'' by Mike Strohl (PBC
International Inc., $19.95) shows a wide variety of excellent
interior photographs and explains the theories and execution of the
designs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feng Shui Design: The Art of Creating Harmony for Interiors,
Landscape and Architecture'' by Sarah Rossbach and Master Lin Yun
(Viking, $29.95) may be the best yet on feng shui (pronounced
``fung shway''), combining history and modern practicality with
charts, graphics and photographs.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Styles &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Americans are drawn to the charm of country French style and the
warmth of English decorating. Two new books offer in-depth looks
and ample advice on how to create them in your own home.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Provenal Interiors: French Country Style in America''
(Gibbs Smith, $39.95), interior designer Betty Lou Phillips, a
former Houston resident, uses her seasoned expertise to explain why
she considers this style understated luxury at its finest. The
photographs demonstrate how many designers have re-created it in
American homes. The book provides an extensive resource list, with
a number of Houston firms included.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl MacLachlan takes us step-by-step through inviting English
interiors, from overstuffed chintz sofas to vibrant colors and dark
woods, in ``Bringing It Home: England'' (Clarkson Potter, $40). The
Idea Notebook ending each chapter gives simple suggestions for
decorating the English way, and history boxes provide background on
traditions.
</P>
<P>
   If neither French nor English is your look, here are more books
to tug at your style inclinations:
</P>
<P>
   ``San Francisco Modern: Interiors, Architecture &AMP; Design'' by
Zahid Sardar and J.D. Peterson (Chronicle Books, $40) _ a tour of
32 residences from opulent Russian Hill flats to funky studios _ is
a treat for anyone with modern taste.
</P>
<P>
   Two books that celebrate today's penchant for furnishings that
reflect another age are ``Flea Market Style: Decorating With a
Creative Edge'' by Emelie Tolley and Chris Mead (Clarkson Potter,
$30) and ``At Home With the Past: How the Love of Old Things
Creates Beautiful Interiors'' by Steve Gross and Sue Daley
(Clarkson Potter, $40). &QL;

TEXAS RULES ALCOHOL VENDING MACHINES ILLEGAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE OLAFSON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Beer drinkers in Texas will have to keep getting their
brews the old-fashioned way after a state attorney general's
opinion declaring that high-tech vending machines that dispense
booze are illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The legal opinion, sought by the administrator of the Texas
Alcoholic Beverage Commission, means that adult beverage machines
that had been placed at private golf courses in the Dallas area
will have to be removed.
</P>
<P>
   The commission had agreed in June to allow installation of the
machines, but a state representative and an official with Mothers
Against Drunk Driving protested the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Their protest was based on the state's Alcoholic Beverage Code,
which states that coin-operated machines or ``similar devices'' may
not be used to sell alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   An Oklahoma City company had argued that its machines, which
dispense drinks when a customer enters a personal identification
number, are not covered by the statute.
</P>
<P>
   The state Alcoholic Beverage Commission sought the attorney
general's opinion after state Rep. Scott Hochberg, D-Texas, and
Vena Cronin, a Houston MADD activist, complained that the agency
was attempting to legislate liquor laws without public involvement
in the process.
</P>
<P>
   The state Attorney General's Office, in a Nov. 13 opinion,
agreed with Hochberg and Cronin, stating that it is ``patently
obvious'' that adult beverage machines are similar to coin-operated
machines, and thus prohibited. Hochberg and Cronin, who had feared
the machines could lead to illegal sales to minors, said they are
happy with the attorney general's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the A.G. made an obvious decision in an obvious case
that was obvious to everybody but the TABC,'' Hochberg said
Tuesday. ``It was pretty clear to me what the law said.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Cronin: ``We don't need TABC legislating laws that could be
potential problems.'' &QL;

<P>
   Judith Miller's Classic Style (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $35) is a
visual feast of sophisticated, sometimes surprising traditional
design in the 1990s, preceded by a smartly executed chapter on
history to set the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Those with a passion for the primitive should take a look at
``Rustic Style'' by Ralph Kylloe (Abrams, $39.95), a broad study of
rustic American design, with interiors from Maine to California,
decorating ideas and a resource list. Also ``Adirondack Style'' by
Ann Stillman O'Leary (Clarkson Potter, $37.50), a closeup look at
the rustic New York State playground of the urban elite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexican Color'' by Amanda Holmes and Elena Poniatowska
(Stewart Tabori &AMP; Chang, $35) and ``Mexicolor: The Spirit of
Mexican Design'' by Melba Levick, Tony Cohan and Masako Takahasi
(Chronicle Books, $24.95) use glorious photographs to convey the
compelling architecture, textiles and decorative objects of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Small spaces &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How to live well in limited space is a perennial design topic.
Of course, for some ``limited'' means 900 square feet, and for
others 3,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Not So Big House: A Blueprint for the Way We Really
Live'' (Taunton Books, $30) architect Sarah Susanka explores
common-sense residential design. The smaller home, Susanka
explains, lets us simplify our lives and beautify our space rather
than taxing our energies with high maintenance. If you're building
or buying a new home or considering remodeling, this book offers a
lot to think about.
</P>
<P>
   Two more books devoted to compact quarters are ``Designing for
Small Homes'' by Dylan Landis (PBC International Inc., $34.95) and
``House Beautiful: Small Spaces'' (Hearst Books, $30).
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Design history &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arts &AMP; Crafts design resurfaced in 1988 when Barbra Streisand
paid an astounding $363,000 at auction for a 1903 Gustav Stickley
sideboard. Interest in the furniture and architecture of the early
20th-century movement keeps growing stronger.
</P>
<P>
   A handsome new book, ``Greene &AMP; Greene Masterworks'' by Bruce
Smith and Alexander Vertikoff (Chronicle Books, $40) surveys the
greatest California houses of architects Charles and Henry Greene,
built mostly between 1903 and 1911. This closeup look at joinery,
woodwork and other details, as well as interiors and exteriors,
will thrill Arts &AMP; Crafts Movement enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Form &AMP; Decoration: Innovation in the Decorative Arts,
1470-1870'' by Peter Thornton (Abrams, $39.95) eloquently surveys
four centuries of Western design, from motifs to styles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Public and Private Worlds of Elizabeth I'' by Susan
Watkins and Mark Fiennes (Thames and Hudson, $40) gives an engaging
portrait of the remarkable 16th-century English queen by studying
the Elizabethan homes, portraits, paintings, tapestries and
personal objects of the period.
</P>
<P>
   Francophiles will relish two beautiful new volumes: ``Treasures
of the French Renaissance: Architecture, Sculpture, Painting,
Drawings'' by Ivan Cloulas, Michele Bimbenet-Privat and Serge
Chirol (Abrams, $49.50) and ``Mansions of Paris'' by Olivier Blanc
and Joachim Bonnemaison (Terrail, $27.50).
</P>
<P>
   ``Williamsburg: Decorating With Style'' by Tricia Foley (Crown,
$30) translates the beauty of Colonial Williamsburg to today's
interiors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tuscany Interiors'' by Paolo Rinaldi (Taschen, $39.99) gives
us an intimate tour of the picturesque Italian region and its
residences, both grand and modest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Shaker Legacy: Perspectives on an Enduring Furniture
Style'' by Christian Becksvoort (Taunton Books, $40) explains how
Shaker belief inspired the simple, beautiful furniture still
influencing design today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Design in the Fifties: When Everyone Went Modern'' by George
H. Marcus (Prestel, $29.95) defines the tastes and hopes of a
country emerging from the war years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cultural history &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The study of houses and their furnishings over the centuries can
be a much more enjoyable way to learn history than memorizing dates
or the names of battles. Three books give new slants on this
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``House'' by illustrator Albert Lorenz (Abrams, $17.95) is a
visually wonderful and verbally concise overview of how people have
lived around the world. The intricate drawings, complete with
cutaway perspectives and closeup details, go from Egyptian pyramids
and Roman houses to midcentury mass housing and the Russian space
station Mir.
</P>
<P>
   Homes of the famous, such as Thomas Jefferson and Claude Monet,
are explored _ even the fictional London town house of Sherlock
Holmes. ``House'' is a delightful book for adults and a captivating
way for children to absorb cultural history.
</P>
<P>
   Lecturer and author Myrna Kaye can get so excited over a
marvelous piece of furniture, it's no wonder she finds studying
historical interiors a way to learn how people lived and who they
were. In ``There's a Bed in the Piano: The Inside Story of the
American Home'' (Bulfinch Press, $38.50), Kaye shows us how to
``read'' rooms and furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Old etchings and photographs with family and guests, in parlors
or around dining tables, visually describe their tastes and
traditions. As the title suggests, there's a photo of a circa 1870
upright piano whose front pulls down, revealing a fold-out bed _
definitely an entertaining space-saver.
</P>
<P>
   More recent design history is relished and often ripped apart in
``Your World ... and Welcome to It: A Rogue's Gallery of Interior
Design'' by Patrick Mauries with hilarious illustrations by fashion
designer Christian Lacroix (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25).
</P>
<P>
   Picking apart the fashionable trends and questionable fads, the
authors start with 1960s ``Horizontal Modern,'' work their way
through ``Disco Deco'' in the '70s and ``Be Still, My Chintz'' in
the '80s (Colefax &AMP; Fowler English country), to today's ``Junk
Junkies'' (``decoration addicts'' searching for the ``decrepit,
rickety, scratched, if not downright dubious''). Nothing is sacred.
Sometimes references are too insider for most of us, but it's
wicked, fun reading. &QL;

A WORLD OF FLAVORS: HOLIDAY COOKBOOKS RANGE FROM BASIC TO EXOTIC 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ANN CRISWELL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ There's a cookbook for everyone this season, whether
you can't boil water or, with a few hours' notice, can prepare a
feast fit for a king. Big and small, general and specific, lavishly
illustrated or not, homespun or sophisticated, this year's books
cover a world of cooking.
</P>
<P>
   The crop of fall books for review has been piling up in the Food
editor's office for months _ recently 22 books arrived on one day.
There are books on chitlins, chocolate, tomatoes, bread, baking,
simple soups and three-ingredient recipes, as well as cookbooks by
celebrities, including semiautobiographical books such as Sophia
Loren's ``Recipes &AMP; Memories'' (GT Publishing, $28). Others include
vegetarian recipes, salsa variations and ideas for healthful
cooking (low-fat, low-cholesterol, low-sodium, low-carbohydrate,
high-fiber).
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   International &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those with a taste for international fare will find inspiration
in ``My Mexico'' by the doyenne of authentic Mexican cooking, Diana
Kennedy (Clarkson Potter, $32.50); ``Rosa Mexicano'' by Josefina
Howard (Viking, $29.95), a culinary autobiography with 60 recipes
from the owner of one of the best Mexican restaurants in New York;
``Simple Menus for the Bento Box'' by Ellen Greaves and Wayne Nish
(Morrow, $25), recipes for the Japanese lunch box (bento) that is a
hot item on the West Coast; and ``Cooking at the Kasbah'' by Kitty
Morse (Chronicle Books, $22.95), recipes from Morse's Moroccan
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Also, ``Julie Sahni's Introduction to Indian Cooking'' (Ten
Speed Press, $16.95); ``Simple Italian Food: Recipes from My Two
Villages'' by TV Food Network star Mario Batali (Clarkson Potter,
$30); and ``Dolci Toscani: The Book of Tuscan Desserts'' by Anne
Bianchi and Sandra Lotti (Ecco Press, $28.95).
</P>
<P>
   Lee Bailey, author of nine best-selling food books, including
``Country Weekends'' and ``Lee Bailey's New Orleans,'' covers
Tuscany, Gascony, the Greek Isles, St. Barth's and New York in this
revised edition of ``Cooking for Friends'' from Gramercy Books
($30). The photography is by Tom Eckerle.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For beginners &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps these are more your speed: ``The Complete Idiot's Guide
to Cooking Basics'' by Ronnie Fein (Alpha Books, $18.95); ``Cooking
For Dummies'' (IDG Books, $19.99); ``The Absolute Beginner's
Cookbook or How Long Do I Cook a 3-Minute Egg?'' by Jackie Eddy and
Eleanor Clark (Prima Publishing, $8.95); and ``How to Cook
Everything'' by Mark Bittman (Macmillan, $25). And you can't go
wrong with Betty Crocker, whose latest is ``Betty Crocker's Cooking
Basics: Learning to Cook with Confidence'' (Macmillan, $19.95).
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Upscale cooking &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More adept culinarians may wish to check out ``Taste'' by David
Rosengarten (Random House, $29.95); ``Saveur Cooks Authentic
American'' (Chronicle Books, $40); and ``Seductions of Rice'' by
Jeffrey Alford and Naomi Duguid (Artisan, $35). ``Saveur'' includes
the recipe for Real Texas Chili from Houstonian Carter Rochelle.
</P>
<P>
   For a new slant on Texas cooking, acclaimed chef Stephan Pyles,
a native Texan and one of the pioneers of Southwestern cuisine, has
written ``New Tastes From Texas'' (Clarkson Potter, $18.95). It
accompanies his public television series of the same name. The
recipe for Grilled Snapper with accompaniments follows.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   African-American cooking &QL;
</P>
<P>
   African, African-American and soul food cookbooks also were big
this year. Consider: ``Ideas for Entertaining from the
African-American Kitchen'' by Angela Shelf Medearis (Plume,
$14.95), with recipes and traditions for holidays throughout the
year; ``The Book of North African Cooking'' by Lesley Mackley (HP
Books, $12), with a color photo and preparation photos of each
recipe; and ``Soul Food'' by Joyce White, a solid book of recipes
and reflections from African-American churches (HarperCollins,
$25).
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vegetables and vegetarian &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This was the year for vegetable and vegetarian cookbooks,
including the slick ``Hot Vegetables'' by Hugh Carpenter &AMP; Teri
Sandison (Ten Speed Press, $17.95). As usual (this is the fifth in
the ``Hot'' series), Sandison's mouthwatering photographs tempt you
to try such unusual dishes as Roasted Beet Salad With Fresh
Mozzarella Cheese.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mollie Katzen's Vegetable Heaven'' (Hyperion, $27.50) is the
latest book from acclaimed chef and public television cook Mollie
Katzen, author of ``Moosewood Cookbook'' and ``The Enchanted
Broccoli Forest.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Cadwallader, author of more than 10 cookbooks and a
nationally syndicated food columnist, tenders simple recipes in
``Easy Vegetarian Cooking'' (Nitty Gritty, $8.95). Tofu is balanced
with a lot of delicious dishes featuring beans, mushrooms,
eggplant, grits, polenta and rice. ``Fresh Vegetables'' by Rose
Grant (Nitty Gritty, $8.95) offers fresh ideas on seasonal
vegetable dishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Occasional Vegetarian'' by Karen Lee with Diane Porter
(Warner Books, $15.99) takes a fresh look at recipes for part-time,
as well as full-time, vegetarians. ``Great American Vegetarian'' by
Nava Atlas (Evans, $24.95) offers traditional and regional recipes,
from Virginia Peanut Soup to New England Blueberry Cake. Atlas also
has written several vegetarian cookbooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fresh From a Monastery Garden'' by Brother Victor-Antoine
d'Avila-Latourrette (Doubleday, $25) is ``an A-to-Z treasury of
delectable vegetable recipes,'' from Artichoke Ragout and Broccoli
Flans to Peach-Zucchini Chutney.
</P>
<P>
   A hot new topic, phytopia or plant-centered cuisine, is explored
in ``the phytopia cookbook'' (LOWERCASE CQ) by Barbara Gollman and
Kim Pierce (Phytopia Inc., $17.98). Phytopia is a word coined from
combining phyto, the Greek word for plant, with utopia. These Texas
authors examine the importance of phytochemicals (including
antioxidants such as beta carotene and vitamin C) and list the
Phytopia Top 10, some of the most powerful or promising phyto
foods: broccoli, oranges, garlic, kale, soybeans, green tea, red
wine, onions, brussels sprouts and tomatoes. Gollman, a spokeswoman
for the American Dietetic Association, did the nutrition analysis
for each recipe.
</P>
<P>
   There are 80 ``completely meat-free'' recipes in ``Babe's
Country Cookbook'' by Dewey Gram (GT Publishing, $19.95). The
porcine star of the Academy Award-winning film gives us a Babe's
eye view of the Hoggett family kitchen. And Babe seems to have
gourmet taste, touting such upscale dishes as Apricot Coffee Cake
With Streusel Filling; Warm Linguini With Fresh Tomato, Balsamic
Vinegar and Parmigiano Reggiano; and Ferdie's Chocolate Bread
Pudding.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

<P>
   Specialty books &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Specialty books that deserve a spot on your cookbook shelf
include:
</P>
<P>
   ``Florence Henderson's Short-Cut Cooking''(Morrow, $19.95). Good
short-cut tips with each appealing recipe, from Favorite Beef
Stroganoff to Quick Chocolate Mousse, from former TV mom Henderson,
who played Carol Brady on ``The Brady Bunch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Memorable Meals'' by San Antonio cooking teacher and hostess
Nancy Wood Moorman (Eakin Press, $22.95). Moorman has taught
classes in Houston at Rice Epicurean Market Cooking School and has
had several autographing sessions here. She studied in Europe, as
well as in San Francisco, with several notable chefs. Traditions of
South Texas ranch cooking and Mexican cuisine are combined with
European influences in more than 180 recipes.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Smokehouse Ham, Spoon Bread, &AMP; Scuppernong Wine''
(Cumberland House, $19.95), Joseph E. Dabney offers a look at the
people, food and customs of the Appalachian Mountains, from pioneer
days to the present. It's an intriguing glimpse into the culture
where corn likker, clabber cheese, hand-churned butter, sausage and
mush, fried apples and molasses gingerbread were common. There are
modern, kitchen-friendly recipes for Crock-Pot Brunswick Stew,
Grits Souffle and No-Mix Blackberry Cobbler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pillsbury Best Desserts'' (Clarkson Potter, $24.95). Your
favorites are sure to be found in this collection, the first
all-dessert book from Pillsbury. Polish your skills by reading the
opening chapter on dessert basics. There's a chapter on cheesecakes
and others on cakes, frosting, pies and tarts and sauces. The
chapter on BAKE-OFF (CQ) Desserts includes such favorites as Topsy
Turvy Apple Pie from 1951 and the first $1 million winner,
Macadamia Fudge Torte.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chocolate &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nick Malgieri, director of the baking program at Peter Kump's
New York Cooking School, was in Houston last week to teach classes
at Le Panier cooking school, owned by LaVerl Daily. He shared
recipes from his latest book, ``Chocolate: From Simple Cookies to
Extravagant Showstoppers'' (HarperCollins, $35). Chocolate lovers
will relate to the renowned baker and pastry chef, who once rushed
home to try a brownie recipe he found on an index card on the
street near his apartment. The only dilemma: which chocolate
creation to choose for a holiday party _ Chocolate Raspberry
Bavarian Cake, Buche de Noel (Christmas Log), Texas Sheet Cake,
Bittersweet Chocolate Crme Brle or Mexican Chocolate Pudding. One
solution? Choose one of each for a dessert party. The Chocolate
Basics chapter is particularly useful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Art of Chocolate'' (Chronicle, $22.95). Elaine Gonzales, a
Chicago teacher and author of several other books on chocolate,
worked with photographer Frankie Frankeny on this beautiful and
useful book of techniques. It includes recipes for cakes, desserts
and confections such as truffles. Chocolate lovers of an artistic
bent will appreciate Gonzales' creations: chocolate leaves,
flowers, cups, baskets and boxes. &QL;

   ``All About Chocolate'' by Carole Bloom (Macmillan, $17). This
lives up to its subtitle, ``The Ultimate Resource for the World's
Favorite Food,'' with the who-what-when-where-why of chocolate plus
25 recipes, from Chocolate Nut Biscotti to Chocolate Espresso Pots
de Creme. The book also includes lists of where to find the best
chocolate in the world, chocolate festivals, events and schools.
Yes, schools. According to Bloom, the best (three-star) chocolates
are found in France, Italy and Switzerland. But she gives two stars
to Fran's Chocolates of Seattle, Wash., and Harbor Sweets of Salem,
Mass.

   There are many similarities between the history of wine in
Australia and that of wine in California.
</P>
<P>
   For example, both industries didn't really get under way until
the mid-1800s. That's about the time Edward Tyrrell planted his
first vines in Australia's Hunter Valley. Today Tyrrell's remains
one of the oldest family-owned wineries Down Under, export manager
Grant Bellve told me sometime back.
</P>

   And Tyrrell's proved to be innovative. ``Tyrrell's also made the
first commercial chardonnay (in 1971) in the Hunter Valley,'' he
said. ``And we were the first to put oak on our chardonnay.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyrrell's makes four ``series'' of wines, but not all are
available here. Here's a look at some, and you'll see what bargains
some of them can be.
</P>
<P>
   One of the series is called ``Long Flat,'' named in 1966 after
one of the best-known Tyrrell's vineyards. The 1996 Tyrrell's
``Long Flat'' Chardonnay/Semillon _ 3 stars _ is a classic
commercial Australian white wine blend, very ``tropical'' in style,
with loads of ripe mangoes, pineapples and vanilla. If you like
that style, you'll love the price: $6.99.
</P>
<P>
   A little leaner, and thus a better food wine, was the 1996
Tyrrell's ``Shee-Oak'' Chardonnay _ 3 { stars _ which is a
single-vineyard wine. Bellve called the Shee-Oak Chardonnay an
``instant gratification'' wine. It's also more expensive at $18.99
and is available only by special order.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 ``Old Winery'' Chardonnay _ 3 stars _ was redolent with
ripe pineapple flavors. The $9.99 price won't dent your mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the ``Private Bin'' series is the 1994 Vat 47 Chardonnay
_ 4 stars _ a classy wine, but the price is classy, too: about
$28.99.
</P>
<P>
   Then we tasted the reds. Make no mistake: The 1997 ``Long Flat
Red'' _ 4 stars _ is a simple wine and meant to be drunk slightly
chilled, but it's also simply delightful. This is a happy wine, a
blend of cabernet, shiraz and mourvedre, with lots of raspberry and
strawberry fruit flavors. For $6.99, jump on it.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 ``Old Winery'' Pinot Noir _ 3 stars _ was a decent
rendition of the red burgundy grape, but it also had a gamay-ish
quality that was a little out of character. About $9.99.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 ``Old Winery'' Cabernet/Merlot _ &UR;  &LR; 3 { stars _ is fairly
rich, ripe and well-balanced. About $9.99.
</P>
<P>
   Australia is famous for its rendition of the red Rhone grape
syrah, which is called shiraz Down Under. The 1995 ``Old Winery''
Shiraz _ 4 { stars _ had lots of raspberry and white pepper
flavors, and was well balanced, with few harsh tannins in the
aftertaste. My note read: ``Grab the lamb chops, baby!'' The $9.99
is a steal.
</P>
<P>
   Also a special order, like the Shee-Oak Chardonnay, is the
individual vineyard 1994 ``Stevens'' Shiraz _ 4 { stars _ with
excellent black fruit flavors, such as black currant, and some
pepper and vanilla undertones. It's not inexpensive at $18.99, but
it is good.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line on Tyrrell's: Some good values here, especially with
the reds.
</P>
<P>
   Tyrrell's is handled here by Glazer's.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To paraphrase Paul Revere, ``The holidays are coming! The
holidays are coming!''
</P>
<P>
   And that means it's OK to splurge on wines for family and
friends.
</P>
<P>
   But here are a couple of high-ticket items I can't recommend.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, egos have gotten completely out of
control in some corners of California. Some wineries with barely a
two- or three-year track record are charging more than $100 for
their wines, usually highly extracted cabernet sauvignons.
</P>
<P>
   Those ridiculous prices mean, unfortunately for us consumers,
that a $40-$50 cabernet is no longer an unusual sight.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the wines in this range are worth it, especially if the
wines have a proven track record of excellence _ and if you can
afford them.
</P>
<P>
   However: Mike Grgich has been making literally world-famous
wines in the Napa Valley since 1972. But his 1995 Grgich Hills
Cabernet Sauvignon _ 2 stars _ is an oddball. Maybe it's too young
_ and Grgich's wines can age _ but this wine has both good fruit
and an unpleasant herbal quality, and the tannins and acidity seem
out of sync with the fruit. I'd like to taste this again in a few
years, but not at $45 per bottle.
</P>
<P>
   You'd be much better off splurging on the 1995 Shafer Cabernet
Sauvignon _ 4 stars _ with its attractive Napa fruit and solid
structure. It isn't cheap _ it's $30 _ but that's a third less than
the Grgich.
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of producers of high-quality alambic
(cognac-style) brandy in California. Perhaps the best-known is
Germain-Robin, which makes a range of brandies that can get pretty
expensive. How much is expensive? How about $240 a bottle for their
``Perfection''?
</P>
<P>
   Now that's expensive.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not worth it. Frankly, other Germain-Robin brandies,
far less expensive ones, have tasted better to me.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, brandies in this price category usually are aged
for decades; that's what gives them the deep layers of flavor and
complexity. The Germain-Robin ``Perfection'' _ 2 stars _ however,
is just a 14-year-old brandy. For another thing, while this brandy
is delicate, with some finesse _ and do not infer that this means
heavy, ponderous, oaky brandies are better _ it doesn't have what
aficionados would call a ``middle palate.'' That is, it's light and
pleasant up front, and the aftertaste is decent, but there's a
hollowness to the flavor.
</P>
<P>
   You want a light, delicate alambic brandy? Try the Delamain XO
Pale and Dry _ 5 stars. It's far better, it's almost twice as old _
and it's one-fourth the cost.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the truth _ straight, no chaser.

HOW TO FIGURE THE VALUE OF A PRO TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For those of you in who have figured out the
arcane math that comprises college football's BCS ratings, here's a
brain teaser.
</P>
<P>
   Explain, in 25 words easily understood by college graduates, how
it is that the Oakland Athletics can be:
</P>
<P>
   Bought for $68 million.
</P>
<P>
   Announced as having been bought for $85 million.
</P>
<P>
   Claimed by their owners to have actually been bought for $95
million.
</P>
<P>
   Valued at $118 million by Forbes magazine.
</P>
<P>
   And put on the market for $155 million.
</P>
<P>
   The annual Forbes rankings always cause a twitter among our
nation's fattest cats, because while we think that sports is about
athletic achievement, they know better.
</P>
<P>
   They know it's about newness of stadiums, number of luxury
suites and available suckers to fill them, total amount of
government givebacks, percentage of bank loans still outstanding,
Internal Revenue Service interaction and amount of money that
doesn't have to be shared with one's partners.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the Forbes list is just a way the suits keep
score.
</P>
<P>
   There are others, to be sure, and they're just as arbitrary and
fluid as this one. How else can you determine that the apparently
bankrupt Pittsburgh Penguins are actually worth $89 million? Or
that the Kansas City Royals were just sold for $75 million, or $33
million under Forbes' mythical blue book, while the New York
Yankees were nearly bought for $600 million, or $238 million more
than the Forbes number.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the Forbes number has no meaning for you or me. But it
would if the Forbes people did a number for us, one that we could
apply our own standards to and adjust for circumstances we
understand.
</P>
<P>
   Let's take a team, do some arbitrary guesswork on the average
value of any team in that league (say, $250 million for an NFL
team, $150 million for an NBA team, $497.50 for an MLS team, etc.),
and apply our own variables.
</P>
<P>
   For example:
</P>
<P>
   If you are about to get a new stadium, add $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   If you have suckers in local government footing the bill, add
another $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   If you have to go to the bank for your financing, subtract $10
million.
</P>
<P>
   For every half-percent rise in the prime rate, subtract $3
million.
</P>
<P>
   If the city ends up being your landlord, subtract $10 million
(legal fees for breaking the lease).
</P>
<P>
   If you sue the city, subtract $15 million. If the city sues you,
subtract $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   If you threaten to move your team, subtract $45 million.
</P>
<P>
   If you move your team to a smaller media market, subtract an
additional $22.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   For every luxury suite, add $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   For every unsold luxury suite, subtract $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   If you find an attorney who can find a way around the
inheritance tax laws, add $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   If you get the first draft pick, add $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   If the first pick signs Arn Tellem, Drew Rosenhaus, Scott Boras
or Don Meehan as his agent, subtract $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   If the first pick is arrested, subtract $180,000.
</P>
<P>
   If the first pick is convicted, subtract the value of the
contract plus $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a good local radio-TV package, add $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a bad local radio-TV package, add $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a competent broadcaster, add $6 million, then
subtract the salary of said broadcaster.
</P>
<P>
   For every bad broadcaster, subtract $3 million for not knowing
better.
</P>
<P>
   For every championship, add $42 million.
</P>
<P>
   For every conference championship, add $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   For every last-place finish, subtract $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   For every big-money player who goes elsewhere because you say
you can't afford nore than a $43 million payroll, subtract half the
price of the contract that player would have received.
</P>
<P>
   For every national commercial one of your players does, add $3
million.
</P>
<P>
   For every appearance on a wrestling pay-per-view event, add $3
million for attractive demographics.
</P>
<P>
   For every illegitimate child/unmarried mother combination,
subtract $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   For every wholesome family man/woman who can't play a lick,
subtract $800,000.
</P>
<P>
   For every federal indictment, subtract $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   For every district attorney willing to plea bargain away jail
time, add $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   If the millennium bug computer catastrophe actually happens,
subtract $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   If it doesn't, add $500,000 and consider yourself lucky.
</P>
<P>
   If your best player chokes your coach, and you end up looking
bad and still have to pay his salary, subtract the purchase price
and get into another line of business.

</P>

more about how Kenneth Starr's people treated Monica Lewinsky at
their first encounter. By Don Van Nata. (1100 words)
</P>
<P>
   And
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-CONSERVATIVES (Washington) _ Even as the House Judiciary
Committee moves to expand its impeachment inquiry, a growing number
of conservatives _ from Huffington to Kristol to Bennett _ are
quietly, grudgingly giving up any hope that President Clinton will
lose his job. By Melinda Henneberger. (1100 words)
</P>
<P>
   And
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-SPEAKERS (Washington) _ Impeachment of the president has
fallen into the vacuum between speakers. Livingston hoped Newt
would deal with it. Newt, ousted by Livingston, seems to have no
interest in solving his successor's problems. Republicans are
increasingly panicked that no one has a party plan. Democrats are
enjoying the show. By Alison Mitchell. (900 words)
</P>
<P>
   DEMS (Washington) _ Sen. Leiberman, Rep. Gephardt and Vice
President Gore address the Democratic Leadership Council. Gore
tries out new slogan, ``practical idealism,'' and takes a slap at
the early Republican front-runner's slogan, saying ``compassionate
conservatism'' falls short of what is needed in America. By
Katharine Q. Seelye. (1000 words)
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-HEALTHCARE (Washington) _ While Republicans dither over

revive the Patients' Bill of Rights. By James Bennet.

</P>
<P>
   TEXAS-MANHUNT (Huntsville) _ Although authorities said
confidently that they would catch Martin Gurule, the first
death-row inmate to escape from the prison, they have been unable
to do so. Now they are adding a helicopter to the search, and the
people who prosecuted him killer have hired body guards. By Rick
Lyman.
</P>
<P>
   WARM-WEATHER (Chicago) _ It's ridiculously warm, even in
Chicago. Ski resorts are upset. It's 66 even in places like
Minneapolis. A wrapup, with some scientific explanation about all
this. Is La Nina, who was supposed to bring cold weather, not
coming? By Bill Dedman.
</P>
<P>
   OHIO-SHEPPARD-MURDER (Columbus, Ohio) _ The Ohio Supreme Court
today cleared the way for a wrongful imprisonment lawsuit by the

RECIPES FOR YUMMY CHICKEN AND DUMPLINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's obvious from our mail who a family's best chicken and
dumplings cook is: someone from a previous generation.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Griffis e-mailed the recipe for old-fashioned rolled
dumplings. It's from her grandmother, Pearl George of Columbia, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   The second recipe is from Bessie Long of Weatherford, texas. She
says her mother-in-law made the best chicken and dumplings but
never used a recipe. A daughter-in-law watched as she made the
dumplings and wrote down each ingredient.
</P>
<P>
   GRANDMA'S ROLLED DUMPLINGS
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4
</P>
<P>
   1 egg
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups unsifted flour
</P>
<P>
   Beat first 5 ingredients together with a fork. Add flour and
beat until stiff. Roll very thin on floured board, cut into
1-by-3-inch strips with pizza cutter and drop into 6 cups of
boiling broth to which boned, cut-up chicken has been added. Cook
10 minutes over medium heat. Recipe can be doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Hint for cooking chicken for dumplings: Never boil the chicken
in water alone. Always add salt, black pepper, a touch of onion, a
little garlic powder and either thyme or marjoram. Just a touch of
turmeric also adds great flavor, but don't add too much, or your
broth will be too yellow.
</P>
<P>
   ``This recipe yields the best chicken and dumplings you will
ever eat.''

<P>
   MOTHER LONG'S DUMPLINGS
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6-8
</P>
<P>
   3 cups flour
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon baking soda
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups broth from the cooking chicken
</P>
<P>
   1 beaten egg
</P>
<P>
   Combine first 4 ingredients, cutting in the butter.
</P>
<P>
   Add broth and beaten egg. Pour mixture onto well-floured board.
It will be thin, but work excess flour into the dough as you pat it
into a 1/2-inch sheet. Cut into strips and drop into boiling broth
with the almost-cooked chicken.

<P>
   Lagniappe: Sometimes, readers just want to share a recipe that
is always a great success, even though it hasn't been requested.
Here are two we received recently. The first is from Geraldine Hall
of De Leon, Texas, who discovered this recipe in ``Potluck on the
Pedernales.'' She made it for her husband, who doesn't like
broccoli. Not only did he eat it, he bragged on it.
</P>
<P>
   The second recipe is from Betty Craiglow of Grapevine, Texas,
who got it from Louisiana relatives.
</P>
<P>
   BROCCOLI SALAD
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6-8
</P>
<P>
   2 bunches broccoli, sliced into fairly small pieces
</P>
<P>
   3 1/4-ounce can black olives, sliced
</P>
<P>
   8 slices bacon, cooked and crumbled
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch scallions, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 cup mayonnaise
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup salad dressing (Miracle Whip)
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup Parmesan cheese (or less)
</P>
<P>
   Italian salad dressing, to thin
</P>
<P>
   Combine vegetables and bacon. Combine dressing ingredients and
pour over vegetables; stir until all ingredients are moist. Chill
for 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Cauliflower may be used in place of some of the broccoli.

<P>
   CIR-FUZZY-COMPUTERS (Undated) _ Arthur and D.W. look for all the
world like simple stuffed toys based on the aardvarks from PBS's
most popular children's show, ``Arthur.'' But these two 21-inch
figures, called Actimates, are not just toys: they are furry
computer peripherals. But Arthur and D.W. are not alone. This fall
has seen the release of a menagerie of fuzzy computers, like My
Interactive Pooh ($99.99) by Mattel and two less expensive toys,
Furby ($34.99) from Tiger Electronics and Real Live Babe ($40), a
toy pig from Equity Toys based on the movie character. All these
dolls offer varying levels of interactivity and differing claims
about educational value. But the educational value of these kinds
of interactive toys is a matter of keen debate among
child-development experts. By Ian Austen.

 FROM: Wired  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 World rights excluding Japan  
 &HT;    Long before NASA's robotic Pathfinder rumbled across the rocky
soil of Mars, Ray Bradbury owned the Red Planet in the popular
imagination, courtesy of ``The Martian Chronicles'' (1950).
 &HT;    His 600-plus short stories have laid claim to other worlds as
well. For example, ``The Veldt'' (1950) inspired a generation of
smart-home and virtual-reality pioneers. ``A Sound of Thunder''
(1952) illustrated chaos theory's butterfly effect years before the
theory existed.
 &HT;    And the character fireman Montag's dash for freedom, televised
by pursuing helicopters in ``Fahrenheit 451'' (1953), could easily
be on Fox-TV's fall schedule. In fact, cameras are ready to roll on
Mel Gibson's version of ``Fahrenheit 451,'' and Avon Books is
reissuing many of the 78-year-old author's titles.
 &HT;    The man who once said ``Give me an ounce of fact and I will
produce you a ton of theory by tea this afternoon'' is today also
an urban design consultant. His ideas have contributed to Disney's
Epcot and the revitalization of downtown Los Angeles.
 &HT;    Here Bradbury talks about how far we've come from the future he
envisioned in the '50s.
 &HT;     -0- 
 &HT;    JOHN GEIRLAND: Describe the city of the future.
 &HT;    RAY BRADBURY: Disneyland! They've done everything right. It has
hundreds of trees and thousands of flowers we don't need, but which
they put in anyway. It has fountains and places to sit. I've
visited Disneyland 30 or 40 times over the years, and there's very
little I would change. Of course, Paris is where Walt Disney
learned all of his lessons.
 &HT;    I once called John Hench at Disney Imagineering: ``John, for
God's sake, I just noticed Viollet-le-Duc's Notre-Dame spire on the
side of Sleeping Beauty's castle.''
 &HT;    ``That's right,'' he said. ``Walt put it there.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What other lessons can we take from the City of Light?
 &HT;    A: The secret of cities is the conviviality of food. Paris has
20,000 restaurants _ if you build a city with 20,000 restaurants,
you have a social city. The United States, and especially Los
Angeles, has forgotten how to eat, how to dine. We need cities
where people can meet, shop and enjoy themselves. That's all cities
are, and all they ever will be.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: You want to shut down LA's freeways. Is that practical?
 &HT;    A: We can eliminate cars and get back to public transit. I've
lived in Los Angeles 64 years and I don't have a driver's license.
Cars have destroyed cities. And the reason there's traffic on the
freeway is because the freeway is there. Freeway driving has
nothing to do with real business needs. It's an excuse for getting
out of the office.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Once the freeways are gone, you propose to build 80 plazas
throughout the LA area. What do you have in mind?
 &HT;    A: I created a blueprint for an ideal plaza _ 400 tables, a
thousand chairs in the open, all kinds of restaurants surrounding
it and theaters at the four corners: a motion picture theater, a
silent motion picture theater, a theater for dramatic presentations
and a music hall presenting all kinds of things, including
symphonies and rock. You have to have a social mix.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: A lot of your work has predicted the future.
 &HT;    A: Yes, and almost everything in ``Fahrenheit 451'' has come
about, one way or the other: the influence of television, the rise
of local TV news, the neglect of education. As a result, one area
of our society is brainless. But I utilized those things in the
novel because I was trying to prevent a future, not predict one.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: The authorities in ``Fahrenheit 451'' also eliminated porches
to reduce social interaction. Has this come to pass?
 &HT;    A: It varies from territory to territory. I was in Omaha
recently and, my God! the size of the lawns and porches and the
feeling of community was incredible. We've been so busy building
outside the city that the city centers are falling apart. Now we're
building substitute cities, such as malls _ substitutes for what we
used to have in every downtown in America.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: How would you change the educational system?
 &HT;    A: President Clinton says he wants to wire every schoolroom. I
say it should happen in third grade, maybe, but kindergarten
through second grade has got to educate kids to read and write,
otherwise they have no tools. Get education back on a local level
where it's controlled by teachers, parents and students. What do
governments know about education? Nothing.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Somewhere in a third-grade class there is a 9 year old who
will be walking on Mars in 2020. How should we prepare that kid?
 &HT;    A: We already are _ my fellow writers and myself. Albert
Schweitzer said: Do something wonderful, people may imitate it. If
you dream the proper dreams, and share the myths with people, they
will want to grow up to be like you. All the astronauts I meet tell
me they have been influenced by me to grow up the way they did. If
you and I dream properly and creatively, then the future will be
secured. But reality will kill you unless you deal with it through
myths and metaphors. The trouble with people who write
realistically is that they want to electrocute you.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What myths should we share?
 &HT;    A: Space travel is our final, greatest dream. If we can reach
the nearest solar system, then we can live for an extra million
years. But ultimately, the particular myth is not important _ it's
how to fall and stay in love. Teach students to be in love with
life, to love their work, to create at the top of their lungs. I
love what I'm doing and started loving it when I was 12. Find
something to love when you're young. Archeology, mythology,
Egyptology, even computerology. Then you can change the future.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Are PCs and the Internet making the future friendlier for
community?
 &HT;    A: No, you've got to make personal contact. Go to the library
and build a network of personal friends, a half dozen or so, as
I've done over the years with other writers. Stop talking on the
telephone, stop talking on the stupid Internet. It's a waste of
time.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: So, no Internet, no computer, not even a driver's license. Is
the modern world passing you by?
 &HT;    A: You don't miss what you've never had. If people talk about
sex when you're 12 years old, you don't know what they're talking
about. I don't know what people are talking about when they talk
about driving. I grew up with roller skates, a bicycle, using the
trolley and bus lines until they went out of existence. No, you
don't miss things.
 &HT;    Put me in a room with a pad and a pencil and set me up against
100 people with 100 computers. I'll outcreate (everyone) in the
room.

 World rights excluding Japan  
 &HT;    Long before NASA's robotic Pathfinder rumbled across the rocky
soil of Mars, Ray Bradbury owned the Red Planet in the popular
imagination, courtesy of ``The Martian Chronicles'' (1950).
 &HT;    His 600-plus short stories have laid claim to other worlds as
well. For example, ``The Veldt'' (1950) inspired a generation of
smart-home and virtual-reality pioneers. ``A Sound of Thunder''
(1952) illustrated chaos theory's butterfly effect years before the
theory existed.
 &HT;    And the character fireman Montag's dash for freedom, televised
by pursuing helicopters in ``Fahrenheit 451'' (1953), could easily
be on Fox-TV's fall schedule. In fact, cameras are ready to roll on
Mel Gibson's version of ``Fahrenheit 451,'' and Avon Books is
reissuing many of the 78-year-old author's titles.
 &HT;    The man who once said ``Give me an ounce of fact and I will
produce you a ton of theory by tea this afternoon'' is today also
an urban design consultant. His ideas have contributed to Disney's
Epcot and the revitalization of downtown Los Angeles.
 &HT;    Here Bradbury talks about how far we've come from the future he
envisioned in the '50s.
 &HT;     -0- 
 &HT;    JOHN GEIRLAND: Describe the city of the future.
 &HT;    RAY BRADBURY: Disneyland! They've done everything right. It has
hundreds of trees and thousands of flowers we don't need, but which
they put in anyway. It has fountains and places to sit. I've
visited Disneyland 30 or 40 times over the years, and there's very
little I would change. Of course, Paris is where Walt Disney
learned all of his lessons.
 &HT;    I once called John Hench at Disney Imagineering: ``John, for
God's sake, I just noticed Viollet-le-Duc's Notre-Dame spire on the
side of Sleeping Beauty's castle.''
 &HT;    ``That's right,'' he said. ``Walt put it there.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What other lessons can we take from the City of Light?
 &HT;    A: The secret of cities is the conviviality of food. Paris has
20,000 restaurants _ if you build a city with 20,000 restaurants,
you have a social city. The United States, and especially Los
Angeles, has forgotten how to eat, how to dine. We need cities
where people can meet, shop and enjoy themselves. That's all cities
are, and all they ever will be.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: You want to shut down LA's freeways. Is that practical?
 &HT;    A: We can eliminate cars and get back to public transit. I've
lived in Los Angeles 64 years and I don't have a driver's license.
Cars have destroyed cities. And the reason there's traffic on the
freeway is because the freeway is there. Freeway driving has
nothing to do with real business needs. It's an excuse for getting
out of the office.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Once the freeways are gone, you propose to build 80 plazas
throughout the LA area. What do you have in mind?
 &HT;    A: I created a blueprint for an ideal plaza _ 400 tables, a
thousand chairs in the open, all kinds of restaurants surrounding
it and theaters at the four corners: a motion picture theater, a
silent motion picture theater, a theater for dramatic presentations
and a music hall presenting all kinds of things, including
symphonies and rock. You have to have a social mix.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: A lot of your work has predicted the future.
 &HT;    A: Yes, and almost everything in ``Fahrenheit 451'' has come
about, one way or the other: the influence of television, the rise
of local TV news, the neglect of education. As a result, one area
of our society is brainless. But I utilized those things in the
novel because I was trying to prevent a future, not predict one.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: The authorities in ``Fahrenheit 451'' also eliminated porches
to reduce social interaction. Has this come to pass?
 &HT;    A: It varies from territory to territory. I was in Omaha
recently and, my God! the size of the lawns and porches and the
feeling of community was incredible. We've been so busy building
outside the city that the city centers are falling apart. Now we're
building substitute cities, such as malls _ substitutes for what we
used to have in every downtown in America.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: How would you change the educational system?
 &HT;    A: President Clinton says he wants to wire every schoolroom. I
say it should happen in third grade, maybe, but kindergarten
through second grade has got to educate kids to read and write,
otherwise they have no tools. Get education back on a local level
where it's controlled by teachers, parents and students. What do
governments know about education? Nothing.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Somewhere in a third-grade class there is a 9 year old who
will be walking on Mars in 2020. How should we prepare that kid?
 &HT;    A: We already are _ my fellow writers and myself. Albert
Schweitzer said: Do something wonderful, people may imitate it. If
you dream the proper dreams, and share the myths with people, they
will want to grow up to be like you. All the astronauts I meet tell
me they have been influenced by me to grow up the way they did. If
you and I dream properly and creatively, then the future will be
secured. But reality will kill you unless you deal with it through
myths and metaphors. The trouble with people who write
realistically is that they want to electrocute you.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What myths should we share?
 &HT;    A: Space travel is our final, greatest dream. If we can reach
the nearest solar system, then we can live for an extra million
years. But ultimately, the particular myth is not important _ it's
how to fall and stay in love. Teach students to be in love with

 World rights excluding Japan  
 &HT;    Within months, a simple, single tower will rise up on the edge
of Australia's vast central desert, inaugurating an era of space
access in which launching payloads to low Earth orbit could be as
easy as booking a night flight to New York.
 &HT;    Kistler Aerospace, headquartered in Kirkland, Wash., is the
company behind the project. Using one of the finest collections of
post-Apollo space engineering talent ever assembled, Kistler wants
to upend our whole approach to getting to space and transform this
scrubby Mad Max desert into an active spaceport.
 &HT;    Its vehicle: a rocket that returns to Earth using parachutes and
airbags, ready for relaunch within days.
 &HT;    If Kistler succeeds, it will be the first in a group of
companies dubbed the Four Musketeers to realize the vision of
reusable space transport.
 &HT;    By introducing airline-type efficiencies to the business of
launching private rockets into space, these new companies aim to
reduce the cost of a typical satellite launch to $1,000 per pound,
down from the current $5,000 to $10,000. Kelly Space &AMP; Technology,
Pioneer Rocketplane, Rotary Rocket and Kistler Aerospace plan to
toss away a decades-old Cold War legacy of government space
monopoly and instead launch private rockets that can be rapidly
refueled and reflown.
 &HT;    In this way, telecommunications, transportation, medicine, even
tourism could be dramatically transformed.
 &HT;    ``If the future holds infinite possibilities for man's presence
in space, transportation is one thing that has to happen,'' says
Mike Kelly, cofounder of Kelly Space &AMP; Technology.
 &HT;    Nearly 1,700 payloads worth $121 billion will need a ride to
space over the next 10 years, according to estimates by the Teal
Group, a defense and aerospace market-analysis firm. Since the
launch industry has never before seen such demand, the anticipated
bonanza is pulling in everyone from NASA lifetime employees to
writer Tom Clancy, who has invested $1 million in Rotary Rocket.
 &HT;    Seventy percent of the payloads will be commercial
communications satellites, most of them in low Earth orbit, or LEO.
Constellations of these satellites will let you travel around the
entire world with one phone number. They'll make pagers beep in
even the most bucolic of rural settings. They'll render high-speed
Internet access more pervasive than ever thought possible.
 &HT;    Taken together, these satellite families will transform the
night sky, effectively turning the orbits into foundations as solid
as city streets for the building of new industries based in space.
 &HT;    Last year, 77 commercial payloads were carried to space
worldwide, tripling the number seen the year before and
outnumbering military and civil-government payloads for the first
time. The quicker these new constellations get deployed and the
more rapidly and cheaply they can be serviced, the faster the
prices of new paging, mobile-phone and Internet services will fall.
 &HT;    And as prices fall, all kinds of other space-based products,
ranging from increasingly sophisticated car-navigation systems to
remote telemedicine, are sure to emerge.
 &HT;    The reduced gravity of orbit could result in new materials
processes, while reusable rockets could deliver packages more
quickly than overnight services by climbing to orbit and dropping
down half a world away in just a few hours.
 &HT;    Many imagine space tourism as a big earner, and one company is
already delivering cremated remains to low Earth orbit for
``burial.''
 &HT;    Iridium, the world's first pan-national corporation _ that is, a
global partnership _ will begin its global telephone service in
late September, and has set the stage for the coming revolution in
space commerce. Although launched on conventional, expendable
boosters, its 485-mile-high, 66-satellite constellation has shown
that giant space-infrastructure projects could be completed at a
speed and budget once considered impossibly tight.
 &HT;    Hot on Iridium's heels is Globalstar, a system of 48 satellites
870 miles high, which is expected to be operational next year.
Other constellation builders include ICO Global Communications,
which is aiming for a first launch to the slightly higher medium
Earth orbit (MEO) before year's end.
 &HT;    Next come what sound like a forgotten Homeric trilogy: Ellipso,
Constellation and Odyssey; each plans initial launches for the year
2000.
 &HT;    Once these constellations are in place, replacements will be
needed regularly as satellites burn out and break down. Late last
year Motorola, already a big buyer of launch services as it builds
Iridium, told launch-service providers it may put up 500 or more
birds by 2010.
 &HT;    These ``big LEOs'' will be joined by ``little LEOs'' that will
soar about 500 to 1,500 miles above Earth (commercial airplanes fly
at an altitude of about 5 miles) and perform highly specific
functions such as reading water meters from space, offering
advanced two-way paging, and tracking fishing vessels on the high
seas. The master of this domain is Orbcomm Global, a Dulles, Va.,
company well on its way to completing a 28-satellite system for
industrial monitoring and two-way paging.
 &HT;    Around 2001, deployment will start for ultrasophisticated
high-bandwidth constellations known as ``broadband LEOs'' that will
make high-speed connectivity _ for videoconferencing and Internet
services, among other activities _ available just about anywhere in
the world.
 &HT;    In this category are Motorola's Celestri, with 63 functioning
satellites; Alcatel Espace's Skybridge, with 64; and the big kahuna
of them all, Teledesic, now at 288.
 &HT;    Until now, most LEOs have gone skyward on heavy booster rockets
capable of carrying several satellites into orbit at once. These
expendable and expensive ballistic workhorses _ with heroic names
such as Delta, Proton and Long March _ are highly impractical for
the kinds of one-by-one replacements the new communications systems
will require.
 &HT;    Recognizing that every large edifice requires a maintenance
staff, Kistler and the other companies _ dubbed the Musketeers _
aim to be the lightbulb changers of space.
 &HT;    For 80-year-old George Mueller, the success of a reusable rocket
would mark a final transition from Cold War technologist to
commercial businessman. Formerly head of NASA's Apollo project and
considered the father of the space shuttle, he's now Kistler's CEO.
 &HT;    Mueller, whose space career blasted off in 1961 when President
John F. Kennedy started the race to the Moon, eventually left the
agency to grow jojoba in Arizona. He was drawn out of retirement by
Kistler to realize a long-held dream denied by the government.
 &HT;    ``I had wanted to design the shuttle to be fully reusable,''
Mueller says. ``This position enables me to accomplish that.''
 &HT;    Mueller's new line of work was made possible in 1984, when the
U.S. Congress passed the Commercial Space Launch Act to encourage
private companies to join the industry.
 &HT;    Momentum picked up after the 1986 Challenger explosion caused an
effective ban on commercial payloads aboard the remaining shuttles,
leading to a bottleneck that persists to this day. And post-Cold
War reductions in military spending meant increased access for
entrepreneurs to U.S. military facilities, not to mention an excess
supply of aeronautical engineers.
 &HT;    Not surprisingly, some of these nascent commercial space
operations have set up shop in old government haunts _ including
Vandenberg Air Force Base and the shuttered Norton Air Force Base,
now renamed the San Bernardino International Airport. Others have
located elsewhere _ the California-Nevada desert, for example.
 &HT;    While the reliability rate of U.S.-based launches in 1997 was
97.4 percent, the remaining 2.6 percent represents a set of
devastating possibilities. So, for its gamble, Kistler believes
there's no better place than Australia, a country that joined the
space fraternity in 1967, when an atmospheric-testing satellite
launched atop a Redstone rocket made it the fourth country to orbit
a satellite, behind the United States, the Soviet Union and France.
 &HT;    ``Australia has a large footprint of flat land, and almost no
population,'' says Robert Wang, Kistler's chair. ``It's a lot safer
to launch from there.''
 &HT;    The challenges Kistler faces remind George Mueller of NASA's
gung-ho days, but he also sees the distinctions.
 &HT;    ``Now, while the schedule is just as intense, you also have
shareholders to worry about,'' he says.
 &HT;    Through private placements, Kistler has raised $300 million and
will seek more to carry it through the testing phase and into
commercial service in late 1999. The company's technology utilizes
a K-1 rocket that will shoot to 135,000 feet, where a second stage
will separate from the first and carry a payload to low Earth
orbit. Navigational systems will then guide both stages back to the
launch area.
 &HT;    Assuming test flights go well, Kistler plans to deliver a
commercial satellite for Space Systems/Loral late next year,
marking the first of a 10-launch, $100 million contract. This,
Kistler is sure, is only the beginning.
 &HT;    Others are equally confident. Revenues in the global space
industry could rise 20 percent annually for years to come, says
John Higginbotham, chair of SpaceVest, a Reston, Va., venture firm
dedicated to space investments.
 &HT;    ``In some ways the space industry in 1998 is where the
automobile industry was in 1938,'' Higginbotham says. ``If you look
at where the space industry can be in 2048, it could be a major
sector of the global economy, equal to health care or the auto
industry today.''
 &HT;    He sees profitable new products emerging from the space
business.
 &HT;    For Higginbotham, it's uncertain how many independent launch
companies the space industry can support. Competition may emerge
from a privatized U.S. space shuttle and from low-cost launch
services from China and Russia, both of which use expendable
rockets.
 &HT;    NASA is also working with Lockheed Martin and Orbital Sciences
on two aerospace plane projects dubbed the X-33 and X-34, intended
primarily to test new engine and materials technologies for a
single-stage-to-orbit vehicle.
 &HT;    While Kistler is developing technology that returns rockets to
Earth on parachutes and airbags, other outfits are eliminating the
launchpad itself.
 &HT;    One of them is Kelly Space &AMP; Technology, which is camped out in
the suburban confines of San Bernardino, Calif. Using a modified
commercial jet, Kelly plans to tow an aerospace plane to 20,000
feet, where it will detach and rocket up to 400,000 feet. From
there, an expendable stage will carry a payload to orbit, while the
piloted aerospace plane returns to Earth, landing, like a
commercial jet, on a runway.
 &HT;    If there's a malfunction at 20,000 feet, Kelly's space vehicle
can return to Earth as a glider. The company has been testing the
system in the California desert, and hopes to carry commercial
payloads next year.
 &HT;    Musketeer No. 3 is Pioneer Rocketplane, a start-up venture
located at Vandenberg Air Force Base, just north of Santa Barbara,
Calif. Pioneer is fusing aircraft and rocket into one in an
airplane-like space vehicle that takes off from a commercial runway
with a payload inside. At 20,000 feet, the vehicle meets up with a
tanker plane, which loads an oxidizer. The rocket plane then blasts
into orbit and releases an additional stage, which carries the
payload to its destination and later disintegrates in the
atmosphere. Meanwhile, the pilots return the rocket plane to
Vandenberg.
 &HT;    The vehicle is still in development, but it could take flight by
2000, says Mitchell Burnside Clapp, Pioneer's president and
cofounder. The company estimates its total development costs at
$100 to $200 million, with first revenue expected by 2001.
 &HT;    ``We'll be looking for replenishment business from Iridium,
Globalstar, and, of course, the Teledesic deployment,'' Clapp says.
``There's going to be no shortage of market.''
 &HT;    Rotary Rocket is taking an equally bold step. The Redwood
Shores, Calif., enterprise plans to use a piloted rocket on the way
up to low Earth orbit and a unique set of helicopter-type rotors to
return to Earth, requiring little in the way of ground
infrastructure. The system remains in the design phase, with tests
at California's Mojave Airport scheduled for next year.
 &HT;    Among those watching Rotary keenly is novelist Clancy, an
acknowledged space buff who invested in the venture after meeting
its president, Gary C. Hudson. Hudson has been plying the
commercial launch market without a launch for some 20 years.
 &HT;    So far, Rotary has raised $17 million of private capital, and it
hopes to raise another $30 million through a private equity
placement. All told, the company needs about $100 million to get a
small fleet operational and start bringing in revenue.
 &HT;    Like Pioneer, Rotary has no contracts yet, but it believes the
LEO-replacement market will provide ready bookings.
 &HT;    It was Hughes who dubbed his firm and its three major
competitors the Four Musketeers, and he thinks there's room in the
market for even more players, all offering somewhat differentiated
services and products.
 &HT;    ``There are other companies, though most of them are still
garage operations,'' he says. ``We distinctly remember when we were
a garage operation, so we don't dismiss them.''
 &HT;    Many of these more futuristic companies are focusing on tourism,
with initial launches expected in 2001 or later. Conceivably, for a
ticket costing about $90,000, you could hop a flight to suborbital
altitude for a quick dose of weightlessness, a view of Earth's
curvature, and a peek into the blackness of space.
 &HT;    While the success or failure of these individual firms may not
be known for a few more years, the early activity is already making
for crowded conditions at established launch sites.
 &HT;    Besides Cape Canaveral and Vandenberg, a site on Wallops Island,
in Virginia, has been licensed by the FAA for commercial launches.
New Mexico and Alaska are also looking to provide launch
operations, along with a site in Manitoba, Canada.
 &HT;    In Australia, other groups of entrepreneurs also are evaluating
launch sites. One has studied the Northern Territory, focusing on
Christmas Island, an atoll in the Indian Ocean that offers open
seas for flight corridors to the south.

 World rights excluding Japan  
 &HT;    Within months, a simple, single tower will rise up on the edge
of Australia's vast central desert, inaugurating an era of space
access in which launching payloads to low Earth orbit could be as
easy as booking a night flight to New York.
 &HT;    Kistler Aerospace, headquartered in Kirkland, Wash., is the
company behind the project. Using one of the finest collections of
post-Apollo space engineering talent ever assembled, Kistler wants
to upend our whole approach to getting to space and transform this
scrubby Mad Max desert into an active spaceport.
 &HT;    Its vehicle: a rocket that returns to Earth using parachutes and
airbags, ready for relaunch within days.
 &HT;    If Kistler succeeds, it will be the first in a group of
companies dubbed the Four Musketeers to realize the vision of
reusable space transport.
 &HT;    By introducing airline-type efficiencies to the business of
launching private rockets into space, these new companies aim to
reduce the cost of a typical satellite launch to $1,000 per pound,
down from the current $5,000 to $10,000. Kelly Space &AMP; Technology,
Pioneer Rocketplane, Rotary Rocket and Kistler Aerospace plan to
toss away a decades-old Cold War legacy of government space
monopoly and instead launch private rockets that can be rapidly
refueled and reflown.
 &HT;    In this way, telecommunications, transportation, medicine, even
tourism could be dramatically transformed.
 &HT;    ``If the future holds infinite possibilities for man's presence
in space, transportation is one thing that has to happen,'' says
Mike Kelly, cofounder of Kelly Space &AMP; Technology.
 &HT;    Nearly 1,700 payloads worth $121 billion will need a ride to
space over the next 10 years, according to estimates by the Teal
Group, a defense and aerospace market-analysis firm. Since the
launch industry has never before seen such demand, the anticipated
bonanza is pulling in everyone from NASA lifetime employees to
writer Tom Clancy, who has invested $1 million in Rotary Rocket.
 &HT;    Seventy percent of the payloads will be commercial
communications satellites, most of them in low Earth orbit, or LEO.
Constellations of these satellites will let you travel around the
entire world with one phone number. They'll make pagers beep in
even the most bucolic of rural settings. They'll render high-speed
Internet access more pervasive than ever thought possible.
 &HT;    Taken together, these satellite families will transform the
night sky, effectively turning the orbits into foundations as solid
as city streets for the building of new industries based in space.
 &HT;    Last year, 77 commercial payloads were carried to space
worldwide, tripling the number seen the year before and
outnumbering military and civil-government payloads for the first
time. The quicker these new constellations get deployed and the
more rapidly and cheaply they can be serviced, the faster the
prices of new paging, mobile-phone and Internet services will fall.
 &HT;    And as prices fall, all kinds of other space-based products,
ranging from increasingly sophisticated car-navigation systems to
remote telemedicine, are sure to emerge.
 &HT;    The reduced gravity of orbit could result in new materials
processes, while reusable rockets could deliver packages more
quickly than overnight services by climbing to orbit and dropping
down half a world away in just a few hours.
 &HT;    Many imagine space tourism as a big earner, and one company is
already delivering cremated remains to low Earth orbit for
``burial.''
 &HT;    Iridium, the world's first pan-national corporation _ that is, a
global partnership _ will begin its global telephone service in
late September, and has set the stage for the coming revolution in
space commerce. Although launched on conventional, expendable
boosters, its 485-mile-high, 66-satellite constellation has shown
that giant space-infrastructure projects could be completed at a
speed and budget once considered impossibly tight.
 &HT;    Hot on Iridium's heels is Globalstar, a system of 48 satellites
870 miles high, which is expected to be operational next year.
Other constellation builders include ICO Global Communications,
which is aiming for a first launch to the slightly higher medium
Earth orbit (MEO) before year's end.
 &HT;    Next come what sound like a forgotten Homeric trilogy: Ellipso,
Constellation and Odyssey; each plans initial launches for the year
2000.
 &HT;    Once these constellations are in place, replacements will be
needed regularly as satellites burn out and break down. Late last
year Motorola, already a big buyer of launch services as it builds
Iridium, told launch-service providers it may put up 500 or more
birds by 2010.
 &HT;    These ``big LEOs'' will be joined by ``little LEOs'' that will
soar about 500 to 1,500 miles above Earth (commercial airplanes fly
at an altitude of about 5 miles) and perform highly specific
functions such as reading water meters from space, offering
advanced two-way paging, and tracking fishing vessels on the high
seas. The master of this domain is Orbcomm Global, a Dulles, Va.,
company well on its way to completing a 28-satellite system for
industrial monitoring and two-way paging.
 &HT;    Around 2001, deployment will start for ultrasophisticated
high-bandwidth constellations known as ``broadband LEOs'' that will
make high-speed connectivity _ for videoconferencing and Internet
services, among other activities _ available just about anywhere in
the world.
 &HT;    In this category are Motorola's Celestri, with 63 functioning
satellites; Alcatel Espace's Skybridge, with 64; and the big kahuna
of them all, Teledesic, now at 288.
 &HT;    Until now, most LEOs have gone skyward on heavy booster rockets
capable of carrying several satellites into orbit at once. These
expendable and expensive ballistic workhorses _ with heroic names
such as Delta, Proton and Long March _ are highly impractical for
the kinds of one-by-one replacements the new communications systems
will require.
 &HT;    Recognizing that every large edifice requires a maintenance
staff, Kistler and the other companies _ dubbed the Musketeers _
aim to be the lightbulb changers of space.
 &HT;    For 80-year-old George Mueller, the success of a reusable rocket
would mark a final transition from Cold War technologist to
commercial businessman. Formerly head of NASA's Apollo project and
considered the father of the space shuttle, he's now Kistler's CEO.
 &HT;    Mueller, whose space career blasted off in 1961 when President
John F. Kennedy started the race to the Moon, eventually left the
agency to grow jojoba in Arizona. He was drawn out of retirement by
Kistler to realize a long-held dream denied by the government.
 &HT;    ``I had wanted to design the shuttle to be fully reusable,''
Mueller says. ``This position enables me to accomplish that.''
 &HT;    Mueller's new line of work was made possible in 1984, when the
U.S. Congress passed the Commercial Space Launch Act to encourage
private companies to join the industry.
 &HT;    Momentum picked up after the 1986 Challenger explosion caused an
effective ban on commercial payloads aboard the remaining shuttles,
leading to a bottleneck that persists to this day. And post-Cold
War reductions in military spending meant increased access for
entrepreneurs to U.S. military facilities, not to mention an excess
supply of aeronautical engineers.
 &HT;    Not surprisingly, some of these nascent commercial space
operations have set up shop in old government haunts _ including
Vandenberg Air Force Base and the shuttered Norton Air Force Base,
now renamed the San Bernardino International Airport. Others have
located elsewhere _ the California-Nevada desert, for example.
 &HT;    While the reliability rate of U.S.-based launches in 1997 was
97.4 percent, the remaining 2.6 percent represents a set of
devastating possibilities. So, for its gamble, Kistler believes
there's no better place than Australia, a country that joined the
space fraternity in 1967, when an atmospheric-testing satellite
launched atop a Redstone rocket made it the fourth country to orbit
a satellite, behind the United States, the Soviet Union and France.
 &HT;    ``Australia has a large footprint of flat land, and almost no
population,'' says Robert Wang, Kistler's chair. ``It's a lot safer
to launch from there.''
 &HT;    The challenges Kistler faces remind George Mueller of NASA's
gung-ho days, but he also sees the distinctions.
 &HT;    ``Now, while the schedule is just as intense, you also have
shareholders to worry about,'' he says.
 &HT;    Through private placements, Kistler has raised $300 million and
will seek more to carry it through the testing phase and into
commercial service in late 1999. The company's technology utilizes
a K-1 rocket that will shoot to 135,000 feet, where a second stage
will separate from the first and carry a payload to low Earth
orbit. Navigational systems will then guide both stages back to the
launch area.
 &HT;    Assuming test flights go well, Kistler plans to deliver a
commercial satellite for Space Systems/Loral late next year,
marking the first of a 10-launch, $100 million contract. This,
Kistler is sure, is only the beginning.
 &HT;    Others are equally confident. Revenues in the global space
industry could rise 20 percent annually for years to come, says
John Higginbotham, chair of SpaceVest, a Reston, Va., venture firm
dedicated to space investments.
 &HT;    ``In some ways the space industry in 1998 is where the
automobile industry was in 1938,'' Higginbotham says. ``If you look
at where the space industry can be in 2048, it could be a major
sector of the global economy, equal to health care or the auto
industry today.''
 &HT;    He sees profitable new products emerging from the space
business.
 &HT;    For Higginbotham, it's uncertain how many independent launch
companies the space industry can support. Competition may emerge
from a privatized U.S. space shuttle and from low-cost launch
services from China and Russia, both of which use expendable
rockets.
 &HT;    NASA is also working with Lockheed Martin and Orbital Sciences
on two aerospace plane projects dubbed the X-33 and X-34, intended
primarily to test new engine and materials technologies for a
single-stage-to-orbit vehicle.
 &HT;    While Kistler is developing technology that returns rockets to
Earth on parachutes and airbags, other outfits are eliminating the
launchpad itself.
 &HT;    One of them is Kelly Space &AMP; Technology, which is camped out in
the suburban confines of San Bernardino, Calif. Using a modified
commercial jet, Kelly plans to tow an aerospace plane to 20,000
feet, where it will detach and rocket up to 400,000 feet. From
there, an expendable stage will carry a payload to orbit, while the
piloted aerospace plane returns to Earth, landing, like a
commercial jet, on a runway.
 &HT;    If there's a malfunction at 20,000 feet, Kelly's space vehicle
can return to Earth as a glider. The company has been testing the
system in the California desert, and hopes to carry commercial
payloads next year.
 &HT;    Musketeer No. 3 is Pioneer Rocketplane, a start-up venture
located at Vandenberg Air Force Base, just north of Santa Barbara,
Calif. Pioneer is fusing aircraft and rocket into one in an
airplane-like space vehicle that takes off from a commercial runway
with a payload inside. At 20,000 feet, the vehicle meets up with a
tanker plane, which loads an oxidizer. The rocket plane then blasts
into orbit and releases an additional stage, which carries the
payload to its destination and later disintegrates in the
atmosphere. Meanwhile, the pilots return the rocket plane to
Vandenberg.
 &HT;    The vehicle is still in development, but it could take flight by
2000, says Mitchell Burnside Clapp, Pioneer's president and
cofounder. The company estimates its total development costs at
$100 to $200 million, with first revenue expected by 2001.
 &HT;    ``We'll be looking for replenishment business from Iridium,
Globalstar, and, of course, the Teledesic deployment,'' Clapp says.
``There's going to be no shortage of market.''
 &HT;    Rotary Rocket is taking an equally bold step. The Redwood
Shores, Calif., enterprise plans to use a piloted rocket on the way
up to low Earth orbit and a unique set of helicopter-type rotors to
return to Earth, requiring little in the way of ground
infrastructure. The system remains in the design phase, with tests
at California's Mojave Airport scheduled for next year.
 &HT;    Among those watching Rotary keenly is novelist Clancy, an
acknowledged space buff who invested in the venture after meeting
its president, Gary C. Hudson. Hudson has been plying the
commercial launch market without a launch for some 20 years.
 &HT;    So far, Rotary has raised $17 million of private capital, and it
hopes to raise another $30 million through a private equity
placement. All told, the company needs about $100 million to get a
small fleet operational and start bringing in revenue.
 &HT;    Like Pioneer, Rotary has no contracts yet, but it believes the
LEO-replacement market will provide ready bookings.
 &HT;    It was Hughes who dubbed his firm and its three major
competitors the Four Musketeers, and he thinks there's room in the
market for even more players, all offering somewhat differentiated
services and products.
 &HT;    ``There are other companies, though most of them are still
garage operations,'' he says. ``We distinctly remember when we were
a garage operation, so we don't dismiss them.''
 &HT;    Many of these more futuristic companies are focusing on tourism,
with initial launches expected in 2001 or later. Conceivably, for a
ticket costing about $90,000, you could hop a flight to suborbital
altitude for a quick dose of weightlessness, a view of Earth's
curvature, and a peek into the blackness of space.
 &HT;    While the success or failure of these individual firms may not
be known for a few more years, the early activity is already making
for crowded conditions at established launch sites.
 &HT;    Besides Cape Canaveral and Vandenberg, a site on Wallops Island,
in Virginia, has been licensed by the FAA for commercial launches.
New Mexico and Alaska are also looking to provide launch
operations, along with a site in Manitoba, Canada.
 &HT;    In Australia, other groups of entrepreneurs also are evaluating
launch sites. One has studied the Northern Territory, focusing on
Christmas Island, an atoll in the Indian Ocean that offers open
seas for flight corridors to the south.

 By CHARLES McGRATH  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    When I was in college, there was a guy famous for wrapping his
brand-new Weejuns with duct tape so that it would look as though
his soles were already flapping. He also, or so it was said, took
brand-new shirts from Brooks Brothers and painstakingly frayed the
cuffs with sandpaper.
 &HT;    This was at Yale in the late '60s, during the last wheezing gasp
_ the final catarrh _ of the patrician ethos that held that the
ultimate status, the highest social perch, belonged to those who
seemingly paid no attention to status. That poor Yalie, with his
tape and sandpaper, made the fatal mistake, of course: He cared too
much and, worse, was seen to care. But in other respects he
understood the code perfectly.
 &HT;    In those days, old was still good. Shabby was good. Instead of
renting a tuxedo, for example, or even buying a new one, it was far
cooler to borrow your great-uncle Ned's _ that hand-sewn mohair
dreadnought, now mossy with age, that he wore to the Stork Club in
the '40s while squiring tipsy debutantes.
 &HT;    What recommended this mothy garment was not just its special
flask pocket or the cigarette burn on the left lapel but that it
(quietly) advertised you as someone who came from tuxedo-wearing
stock, the sort of people who donned formal wear all the time and
not just on self-conscious occasions.
 &HT;    This particular social code owed a lot, obviously, to the old
WASP tradition, with its shunning of vulgar display and its
reverence for old (as opposed to new) anything _ houses, silver,
furniture and, especially, money. And American WASP-iness _
filtered through our Puritan heritage _ in turn owes something to
an imagined ideal of life among the landed British gentry.
 &HT;    You can see the real thing, lovingly and comically depicted, in
the novels of Nancy Mitford or, more recently, in ``The Dower
House,'' by Annabel Davis-Goff, a novel about arguably the most
puritanically class- and status-obsessed people who ever lived: the
Anglo-Irish, who by the 1960s, when this book is set, are neither
truly English nor truly Irish anymore. All they have left, their
sole badge of identity, is good breeding (among themselves and,
just as important, among their dogs and horses) and their dwindling
store of heirlooms.
 &HT;    In the novel's funniest and most painful scene, the scion of a
noble but down-at-the-heels family describes his attempt to repair
his family's fortunes by marrying a girl from London: The courtship
has to be abandoned when, in a shocking display of commonness, she
carries her handbag down to breakfast.
 &HT;    In midcentury America, you didn't have to be a WASP to
appreciate WASP values. In Irish Boston, where I grew up _ Catholic
Irish, not the other kind _ the middle and working classes
sedulously adopted the customs and preferences of their Yankee
overlords. Men took pride in how often their shoes had been reshod,
in the number of times their car odometers had ticked over.
 &HT;    When our next-door neighbor pulled up one evening in a
late-model Cadillac, eyebrows were raised for weeks _ until it was
discovered that he had inherited it from his father-in-law, who was
an undertaker.
 &HT;    For WASP and non-WASP alike, the old status indicators _ thrift,
simplicity, understatement, self-effacement _ made a virtue of the
inescapable: ignorance, insecurity, penury, not to say stinginess.
They also placed a not entirely inappropriate value on history _ on
things (and the people who owned them) that had stood the test of
time.
 &HT;    So what happened? WASP, where is thy sting? Already when I was
in college, there were hints of a new elite, of non-status-seeking
pursued with unimaginable rigor. There were people who didn't even
own Weejuns, much less tape them _ who either didn't know the code
or didn't care and militantly rejected the very idea of property
and hierarchy. (Many of them, after brief stints on the commune,
went on to lucrative careers in investment banking and commercial
real estate.)
 &HT;    And then there were the puritans and the minimalists; you see
them even now, or their descendants, down on Spring Street on
Saturday afternoons _ Mom, Dad and Baby all clad in black, eating
rice cakes and drinking designer water.
 &HT;    The WASP's, meanwhile, fell from their once-lofty ascendance,
done in by inheritance taxes, inbreeding and newly rigorous
admissions standards at the very institutions they once regarded as
their finishing schools. Uncle Ned, were he alive now, would no
longer be working at the family firm. (It was bought out by the
Japanese years ago.)
 &HT;    There's also not enough old stuff to go around anymore. (At a
Sotheby's show of ``important Americana'' recently, I spotted among
the highboys and the sideboards an item labeled ``Sheraton style
... 20th century.'' It was a 1950s coffee table.)
 &HT;    But a more fundamental trouble with the old WASP idea of status
was that it depended on a code as subtle and as complicated as
18th-century calling-card etiquette. The line between an heirloom
and a piece of junk was often hard to draw, as was that between
being ``old shoe'' and looking like a bum. As time went on, fewer
and fewer people knew the signals, until they ceased to be
recognized even by the people who were sending them.
 &HT;    When you think about it, there was probably something phony and
overearnest about America's long romance with gentility and
authenticity. We have always been vulgar _ it's our defining trait.
At the turn of the century, the really rich and really
status-conscious Americans, the people who set the tone that so
many aspired to, were not self-effacing or puritanical at all.
 &HT;    This is the great theme of Edith Wharton and Henry James, that
the Gilded Agers literally wanted entitlement. They wanted palaces
and noble lineage, and they wanted real history, so they went to
Europe and brought it all back _ instant class. Such is the miracle
of America: you can get it now in a good department store in the
Ralph Lauren boutique.
 &HT;    Lauren's genius has been to provide not only stuff that looks
new and feels old _ loafers with a patina of invisible duct tape,
so to speak _ but also a prepackaged ancestral past: cotillions,
hunts, summers at the Adirondack camp. An Uncle Ned for everyone.

 By R.W. APPLE JR.  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    I came to Washington, I always thought, with all the right
stuff: an Ivy League degree, a job on a big-time newspaper, a belly
full of skepticism and a brain littered with assorted information
on throw-weights, T-bills and reapportionment.
 &HT;    I knew who George W. Norris and Arthur Vandenberg and Rexford G.
Tugwell were, and I knew the difference between grands crus and
grand larceny.
 &HT;    I had once had tea at Alice Roosevelt Longworth's.
 &HT;    That pretty well did the trick in the 1970s and 1980s, but not,
alas, in the 1990s. I'm out of some pretty important loops now,
status-wise, because I know little about television and less about
movies. Now that Hollywood narcissism has displaced Rhodes-scholar
earnestness as Washington's controlling ethos, with Barbra
Streisand and David Geffen supplanting George Stephanopoulos and
Robert Reich as prototypical Buddies of Bill, you have to have a
Tinseltown-size appetite for celebrity to keep up in the capital.
 &HT;    Time was, a stiff, black-on-ecru invitation to one of the
soirees given by the grandes dames of Washington was the premier
status symbol. At Evangeline Bruce's or Pamela Harriman's houses,
you might meet the head of the CIA or the members of the permanent
Establishment, those people who had long outlived the
administration that first brought them to town. You might impress
them by your knowledge of the minutiae of politics and government.
 &HT;    The Clintons were launched into Washington by a gala dinner at
Harriman's, come to think of it, but they have long since turned
their backs on most of the people listed in the Green Book,
choosing the glamorous over the grandees.
 &HT;    Me, I still get invited to the British Embassy once in a while,
and before relations between The New York Times and the Clintons
turned testy, I even got asked to the White House a time or two.
But when I failed to recognize Annette Bening at a star-studded
reception at the time of the Clinton inaugural, some of my friends
pitied me. And when I expressed doubts about colleagues who were
trying to turn themselves into celebrities through the pundit
circuit, others dropped me.
 &HT;    The litmus paper changed color especially quickly at the annual
springtime black-tie dinners for Washington reporters and their
guests. They used to be an occasion for us groundlings to chat with
publicity-averse administration officials. (I remember getting Bob
Haldeman in a corner once, the only time I ever talked to him.)
 &HT;    Now, in an effort to make the other guests forget the cheap wine
and the lame jokes, the newsies ask Robert De Niro and Kim Basinger
(and one year, disastrously, the New York shock-jock Don Imus) as
well as Lloyd Cutler and Colin Powell.
 &HT;    The new Washington ought to adopt Suzanne Stone as its mascot.
She was the rapacious small-town weather girl in ``To Die For''
(played by Nicole Kidman, I think) who said you're nothing if
you're not on television. ``What's the point of doing anything
worthwhile,'' she asked, ``if nobody's watching?''
 &HT;    Good question, thinks Washington, vintage 1998, and it has made
Larry King, Tim Russert and Sam and Cokie _ or rather their air
time _ the real forum of American political discourse, eclipsing
the Senate and the House.
 &HT;    During the debate in October about impeachment hearings, Rep.
Robert Wexler, a Florida Democrat, gave the game away. He said that
he wanted to tell his colleagues, ``in the most friendly and
respectful way that I know,'' that he and Rep. Robert Barr, a
Georgia Republican, were scheduled to appear that evening on the
``Crossfire'' program, so he planned to postpone his comments in
the House ``in an effort not to ruin the show.'' No wonder it's
been said that Washington is Hollywood for ugly people.
 &HT;    Everybody's avocation in America is show business, said the man
who wrote ``To Die For,'' Buck Henry. So I guess it's not all that
surprising that President Clinton has got into the game, playing
his sax and discussing his underwear on TV. Or that he spends
almost as much time at fund-raisers in the ballroom of the Century
Plaza as producers, stars and starlets spend in the Lincoln
Bedroom.
 &HT;    Plenty of other Washington heavy-hitters have been fascinated by
Hollywood. But past Presidents kept their psychic distance. John F.
Kennedy was always the star, not the Rat Pack. Bill Clinton, the
unabashed fan of Elvis, is the first star-struck president. I
didn't know Marilyn Monroe, but I know Markie Post is no Marilyn
Monroe.
 &HT;    The president does favors for movieland friends, like arranging
for his national security adviser, Sandy Berger, to brief a group
led by John Travolta on the administration's stand on Scientology.
They, in turn, do favors for him. It's all very chummy.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, former presidents such as Jimmy Carter and Gerald
Ford and eminent senators such as Daniel Patrick Moynihan don't
waste their breath defending Clinton. To the chattering classes of
Georgetown and Cleveland Park, Washington seems critically short of
political heroes these days. But maybe they don't listen to the
right people or read the right publications.
 &HT;    For Hollywood has a whole different take on Clinton's
difficulties. Discussing the president with Elle magazine this
fall, the actress Sharon Stone said this: ``I think Clinton's a
fantastic president. He's done so much good in the world. And
people do not want to assign him the successes of his office. They
only want to assign him the failures. It's really ugly.''
 &HT;    Marshall Herskovitz, executive producer of ``Thirtysomething,''
said recently that Hollywood was more forgiving of Clinton than
other people because it does not see marriage as ``a monolithic
simple entity.''
 &HT;    And Bette Midler told Larry King: ``I feel that he and his wife
have been hounded for the past six years, actually, since they
walked in the door. ... I think he's the smartest guy we ever
had.''
 &HT;    Nowhere else, except in the Congressional Black Caucus and among
the trial lawyers _ surely not among his former aides and onetime
enthusiasts in the universities _ does Clinton get that kind of
unconditional praise.
 &HT;    Maybe it's not surprising that in Washington and in California,
the gossips _ the same ones, now that politics is a subset of
celebrity _ keep whispering that Clinton will go to work one day
for Dreamworks, the entertainment company that Geffen runs with two
other Clinton enthusiasts, Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg,
and live next door to Tom Hanks.
 &HT;    He certainly won't move to Georgetown, where I live, along with
a lot of other people who don't quite fit the new mold. I admit
that I'm of two minds about the status revolution in Washington. I
rather enjoyed playing the old game _ when inside information was
the coin of the realm _ and so naturally I wish I knew more about
the new rules and the redrawn playing field.
 &HT;    But I fear, square that I am, that the whole culture of
celebrity worship has tainted the country, its politics and my
trade as well. In Washington, as elsewhere, fame and fortune, not
talent and perseverance, are now what's most widely respected.
Ex-actors and ex-athletes and relatives of ex-politicians occupy
more and more seats in Congress.
 &HT;    They have instant ``name recognition,'' which is almost as
useful in campaigns these days as money, which propels other people
into high office. You have to wonder whether Abe Lincoln _ homely,
provincial and poor _ would have had a shot at the modern White
House.
 &HT;    Note too that candidates have adopted the techniques of show
business and of marketing, its comrade in hoopla. Both politicians
and producers know that violence sells; as with car chases and gory
murders in movies, TV commercials filled with distorted and
negative language dominate our barren campaigns.
 &HT;    Candidates for important offices no longer proclaim programs and
ideas first and invite people to support them. They take polls to
discover what people think and then develop policies. In other
words, they convene focus groups (cf. sneak previews in Hollywood)
before editing their ideas (cf. recutting the picture).
 &HT;    Politicians' debilitating and humiliating loss of privacy is, of
course, related to the celebrification of politics; we eavesdrop on
Leonardo DiCaprio's love life _ why not on Bill Clinton's? The
voyeur that lurks in each of us has been given more room to do his
stuff, denying it all the while.
 &HT;    Similarly, journalists' loss of standing must have something to
do with the fact that they have emerged from relative anonymity,
reporting less and talking more, part of an ever-growing mountain
of commentary resting on an ever-shrinking base of fact.
 &HT;    I don't blame the man in the street for making very little
distinction between what I do and what Geraldo Rivera does, and
thinking little of either of us. But I don't pretend to like that
particular change in status.

 By R.W. APPLE JR.  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    I came to Washington, I always thought, with all the right
stuff: an Ivy League degree, a job on a big-time newspaper, a belly
full of skepticism and a brain littered with assorted information
on throw-weights, T-bills and reapportionment.
 &HT;    I knew who George W. Norris and Arthur Vandenberg and Rexford G.
Tugwell were, and I knew the difference between grands crus and
grand larceny.
 &HT;    I had once had tea at Alice Roosevelt Longworth's.
 &HT;    That pretty well did the trick in the 1970s and 1980s, but not,
alas, in the 1990s. I'm out of some pretty important loops now,
status-wise, because I know little about television and less about
movies. Now that Hollywood narcissism has displaced Rhodes-scholar
earnestness as Washington's controlling ethos, with Barbra
Streisand and David Geffen supplanting George Stephanopoulos and
Robert Reich as prototypical Buddies of Bill, you have to have a
Tinseltown-size appetite for celebrity to keep up in the capital.
 &HT;    Time was, a stiff, black-on-ecru invitation to one of the
soirees given by the grandes dames of Washington was the premier
status symbol. At Evangeline Bruce's or Pamela Harriman's houses,
you might meet the head of the CIA or the members of the permanent
Establishment, those people who had long outlived the
administration that first brought them to town. You might impress
them by your knowledge of the minutiae of politics and government.
 &HT;    The Clintons were launched into Washington by a gala dinner at
Harriman's, come to think of it, but they have long since turned
their backs on most of the people listed in the Green Book,
choosing the glamorous over the grandees.
 &HT;    Me, I still get invited to the British Embassy once in a while,
and before relations between The New York Times and the Clintons
turned testy, I even got asked to the White House a time or two.
But when I failed to recognize Annette Bening at a star-studded
reception at the time of the Clinton inaugural, some of my friends
pitied me. And when I expressed doubts about colleagues who were
trying to turn themselves into celebrities through the pundit
circuit, others dropped me.
 &HT;    The litmus paper changed color especially quickly at the annual
springtime black-tie dinners for Washington reporters and their
guests. They used to be an occasion for us groundlings to chat with
publicity-averse administration officials. (I remember getting Bob
Haldeman in a corner once, the only time I ever talked to him.)
 &HT;    Now, in an effort to make the other guests forget the cheap wine
and the lame jokes, the newsies ask Robert De Niro and Kim Basinger
(and one year, disastrously, the New York shock-jock Don Imus) as
well as Lloyd Cutler and Colin Powell.
 &HT;    The new Washington ought to adopt Suzanne Stone as its mascot.
She was the rapacious small-town weather girl in ``To Die For''
(played by Nicole Kidman, I think) who said you're nothing if
you're not on television. ``What's the point of doing anything
worthwhile,'' she asked, ``if nobody's watching?''
 &HT;    Good question, thinks Washington, vintage 1998, and it has made
Larry King, Tim Russert and Sam and Cokie _ or rather their air
time _ the real forum of American political discourse, eclipsing
the Senate and the House.
 &HT;    During the debate in October about impeachment hearings, Rep.
Robert Wexler, a Florida Democrat, gave the game away. He said that
he wanted to tell his colleagues, ``in the most friendly and
respectful way that I know,'' that he and Rep. Robert Barr, a
Georgia Republican, were scheduled to appear that evening on the
``Crossfire'' program, so he planned to postpone his comments in
the House ``in an effort not to ruin the show.'' No wonder it's
been said that Washington is Hollywood for ugly people.
 &HT;    Everybody's avocation in America is show business, said the man
who wrote ``To Die For,'' Buck Henry. So I guess it's not all that
surprising that President Clinton has got into the game, playing
his sax and discussing his underwear on TV. Or that he spends
almost as much time at fund-raisers in the ballroom of the Century
Plaza as producers, stars and starlets spend in the Lincoln
Bedroom.
 &HT;    Plenty of other Washington heavy-hitters have been fascinated by
Hollywood. But past Presidents kept their psychic distance. John F.
Kennedy was always the star, not the Rat Pack. Bill Clinton, the
unabashed fan of Elvis, is the first star-struck president. I
didn't know Marilyn Monroe, but I know Markie Post is no Marilyn
Monroe.
 &HT;    The president does favors for movieland friends, like arranging
for his national security adviser, Sandy Berger, to brief a group
led by John Travolta on the administration's stand on Scientology.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    The royal train, sleek and black with pencil-thin red trimming,
is hurtling toward Newcastle, and inside one of the armored middle
cars, Charles, the prince of Wales, is taking his breakfast.
 &HT;    He's dressed down in an open-collar white-and-burgundy striped
shirt, blue cardigan and khaki trousers, and as I enter the cabin,
his look of welcome is mixed with one of concern.
 &HT;    ``I do hope you managed to get some sleep,'' he says, motioning
me to sit across from him.
 &HT;    Gales and lashing rain had rolled in from the North Sea as we
made our midnight departure from Perth, and the heir to the throne
seems to be apologizing for turbulence in the realm.
 &HT;    ``Ghastly night,'' he says.
 &HT;    Freshly done up in blond wood with little ornamentation, the
coach reflects a new reduced configuration aimed at cutting the
train's operating cost. Part of royal downsizing? I ask.
 &HT;    ``Yes,'' he nods. ``What you see is the anorexic British
monarchy.''
 &HT;    In a corner bookcase, there is a small vase of flowers and a
picture of the Queen Mother, said to be Prince Charles' favorite
member of the family. Earlier her two corgis, Dash and Rash, had
taken their morning stroll through the carpeted corridors, friskily
tugging at the leash held by her footman, Leslie Campbell.
 &HT;    The prince's face is ruddy from a blustery weekend at his home
on the Balmoral estate in Scotland, and gray is making a debonair
debut in his thinning hair. His ears are large, as advertised, but
they ride closer to his head and in happier proportion to it than
cartoonists' pens would have you believe.
 &HT;    He speaks so softly that I have to strain to hear him even in
the stillness of the cabin, with its thick, bulletproof windows
keeping out the clatter of our passage along England's northeastern
coast.
 &HT;    Smartly turned out crewmen in navy blazers, charcoal gray
trousers and black shoes shined to a military gloss place before
the prince a silver tray with small jars of preserves and honeys
and a bowl of wheat germ and cereal grains, all of which meet his
high threshold for unadulterated, healthful food.
 &HT;    He reaches for a container of honey, opens it and spoons the
golden spread directly into his mouth. I think I am observing royal
prerogative.
 &HT;    ``I actually don't eat very much at all,'' he says, confirming
the warnings I had received minutes earlier from the butlers and
security men in the mess car as they tucked into their heaping
platefuls of eggs, tomatoes, mushrooms, sausage, bacon and toast.
 &HT;    In fact the atmosphere around the prince and his once-embattled
retinue is assured and upbeat these days. Not long ago the most
reviled member of the British royal family, Charles was able on his
50th birthday in November to look back on a year in which he was
liberated from the competition with Diana, the princess of Wales,
for attention and approval.
 &HT;    He also was given credit previously denied him for being a
sensitive parent to his two sons; was celebrated by the new Labor
government of Prime Minister Tony Blair for the pioneering social
work his Prince's Trust has done; and was encouraged by
significantly growing public endorsement of him as the next
sovereign and of his mistress, Camilla Parker Bowles, as his
private life companion and possible wife.
 &HT;    He has turned the most convulsive moment in his life _ the death
in August 1997 of his former wife, Diana _ into an opportunity for
staging his own revival and for staking a strong claim on the role
of guiding the monarchy into the 21st century.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, his progress has freshened the image of the monarchy.
Mutinous feelings in Britain toward the royals have subsided, and
the major player in disarming the public has surprisingly been
Prince Charles.
 &HT;    For a long time the percussive, single-syllable words like
``twit,'' ``wimp'' and ''prat'' that Britons use to dress down
their well-born often accompanied mention of his name. The product
of an undemonstrative mother, a chastising father and the decidedly
uncozy Windsor household, Charles suffered from self-doubt and
appeared hesitant and distracted in the face of the burdensome
demands of his awesome inheritance.
 &HT;    The question he most commonly puts to people he encounters now
on his official rounds _ ``What do you do?'' _ is one he might have
best avoided years ago for fear someone might ask him back.
 &HT;    When he got around to doing something, he only made matters
worse, uttering ill-thought-out and crudely stated condemnations of
modern architecture, medicine and education. By the time Diana
began attracting favorable attention for her visits to AIDS wards
and refugee camps, Charles had marked himself as something of a
young fogy, dismissing new approaches to old problems as
``fashionable.''
 &HT;    What's more, he was conducting a personal life that became an
ongoing tabloid saga complete with confessional television
interviews and smutty tape recordings of stunningly graceless
sexual small talk.
 &HT;    Recently, however, newspaper and magazine articles and new books
assessing him in connection with his birthday have portrayed a
new-look prince and declared him an underacknowledged overachiever
whose good works went unnoticed in the press onslaught on his
shortcomings.
 &HT;    Anthony Holden, a royal biographer considered hostile by the
prince's supporters and denied all cooperation for his new book,
``Charles at Fifty,'' concluded that ``the human qualities well
known to his inner circle, for all the battering they took during
the Diana years, have come back to the fore. If not entirely at
peace with himself, he is more so with the world around him. Throw
in the shrewdest advisers he has had since his youth, extending
beyond his own office to the inner councils of government, and you
have a public figure suddenly and unexpectedly at the peak of his
powers, bloodied but unbowed by his past, with cause for unwonted
optimism about his future.''
 &HT;    The prince's schedule for this day alone calls for him to spend
seven hours opening a home for the aged, a glass museum, a
job-training center and, most improbably, an oil rig. True, there's
nothing new about the prince of Wales going off to lay cornerstones
and plant trees. In 1997, he had 513 engagements like this.
 &HT;    What is new is that he is no longer alone with his ceremonial
shovel. People are paying attention, and they are doing so because
the ideas of a man long associated with the country's past now seem
very much a part of its future.
 &HT;    Back in the staff mess car, one of Charles' aides confided that
he believed the most significant factor in the changing fortunes of
the prince was the election in May 1997 of Tony Blair and the Labor
Party: ``Suddenly his views became part of the political language
of this country.''
 &HT;    It is a breathtaking fact that many of the reforms the Labor
government is pursuing _ getting private enterprise engaged in
public service and opening up opportunities for young people,
minorities and the unemployed _ are ones that have been undertaken
for years by a member of the famously out-of-touch British
monarchy. On issues such as the environment, genetically modified
food and organic farming, the prince has even bolder prescriptions
than the government.
 &HT;    Where the queen just this year rode in her first public taxi,
walked into her first McDonald's and visited her first pub, Prince
Charles has been tramping through housing projects for two decades.
In 1976, he began a program that made loans available to young
people whom banks wouldn't go near, and the idea is credited with
having helped more than 40,000 people to start new businesses.
 &HT;    Several people who run sections of the Prince's Trust said they
know Charles was motivated to act in the 1980s by evidence that
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's economic revolution was leaving
Britain's poor unprotected and marginalized.
 &HT;    ``It wasn't that he used her name,'' said one executive close to
the prince. ``He spoke out when it was very unfashionable to have
these concerns, and he was the one who persuaded business it had to
enter areas that the government was abandoning.''
 &HT;    Financed by the consolidation of three royal trusts and by
contributions from corporations and individuals, the trust today
manages an endowment of $125 million.
 &HT;    Blair's people have praised the prince for his foresightedness,
and the prince has expressed his pleasure that Labor has found
inspiration in his good works. One gleeful Labor official said,
``He was a Blairite before Blair.''
 &HT;    In contrast, the queen is not known to have any political
viewpoints, and in her long years on the throne she has never been
caught out expressing one. She and Prince Philip are reported by
biographers to be put off by their eldest son's social activism in
general and the perception that he could be playing favorites in
Britain's public life.
 &HT;    The prince has not responded to the grumbling in the House of
Commons about his role, but he has long said the monarchy of the
future should be ``a contributing monarchy.''
 &HT;    In a letter to Tom Shebbeare, the head of the trust, five years
ago, he addressed the question, saying, ``I have no 'political'
agenda _ only a desire to see people achieve their potential.'' He
reasoned that his ability to get attention made him ``a catalyst to
help produce a better and more balanced response to various
problems.''
 &HT;    The prince has known the prime minister since 1990, when Blair
was Labor's shadow employment secretary and took an interest in the
work the Prince's Trust was doing in the area of youth employment.
Their relationship was to deepen in the immediate aftermath of the
death of Diana, as the royal family found itself tone-deaf to the
sorrow and anger of the nation and looked to the newly triumphant
Labor government for help tuning in.
 &HT;    Blair and the prince spoke by phone during the flight Charles
made to Paris to bring Diana's body back to Britain, and associates
of the prime minister played a prominent role in planning the
funeral and in encouraging the royal family to respond to the
outpouring of grief. The prince is the member of the family
credited with convincing the palace that it was too remote, and
much of his counsel came from Blair officials.
 &HT;    Today, on the prince's staff are none of the advisers who
counseled him to confess his adultery in a 1994 television
interview, a strategic decision he now regrets.
 &HT;    While the queen has kept her private secretaries for decades at
a time, Charles has had six since 1985, a measure of his
temperamental leadership. He has now settled down and reached out
to the worlds of politics and entertainment for help. By design,
his staff is no longer all male, all white, all Oxford- and
Cambridge-educated.
 &HT;    Often at odds with their more tradition-bound counterparts in
Buckingham Palace, the prince's people are busy putting forth their
man as the voice of the monarchy's future, even going so far as to
set up his own Web site _ www.princeofwales.gov.uk.
 &HT;    The prince's current honeymoon with the British press began
after a simple act of reconciliation suggested by his new aides.
For 10 years, he had not directed a personal word at any of the
reporters covering him.
 &HT;    Then, on a trip between South Africa and Swaziland last year, a
shirt-sleeved prince walked back to the economy section of the
plane where the press was riding and struck up conversations. He
captivated the surprised reporters with a few jokes on himself, and
by the same afternoon The Evening Standard was on the streets of
London with a front page saying, ``Chattering Charles Plays Royal
Tour Joker.''
 &HT;    The charm offensive was on. Public appearances increased and
Charles began to be seen at West End first nights, film openings,
Spice Girl concerts _ in short, the circles where Diana once
reigned. The usual titled guests at dinners at St. James' Palace
and at Highgrove found themselves seated next to Charles' new
friends, such as Emma Thompson and Rowan Atkinson, whose comic
creation Mr. Bean has come, like the prince, to represent the
lovable side of English awkwardness.
 &HT;    The Sun, Britain's largest-selling tabloid and long a Charles
tormentor, became the recipient of leaks from the prince's office
and made a rapid conversion to the rehabilitation cause. The prince
and his organic garden at Highgrove were lovingly chronicled in
celebrity magazines such as Hello!
 &HT;    Charles took his sons to Vancouver, where they publicly
frolicked in the caps of the Canadian Winter Olympics team. And, in
a gesture interpreted as a truce, the prince agreed to serve as
patron for a new press ball.
 &HT;    At a televised birthday gala, the prince became the star of the
show, appearing in a skit with the actors Stephen Fry and Roger
Moore. The scene was a restaurant, and look-alikes of Michael
Jackson, Tina Turner, Madonna and Humphrey Bogart appeared on stage
as Fry and Moore, the diners, tried unsuccessfully to guess who
they were.
 &HT;    Charles, an accomplished college actor at Cambridge, then walked
on, playing a waiter with a cloth napkin slung over his forearm and
a pen and pad at the ready. When the cheers died down, he
recommended the organic vegetables and cookies made from the
Highgrove granary. ``They're damn good,'' he said.
 &HT;    Moore pondered the prince's performance. ``I know who you're
supposed to be, but you are going to have work on your voice a
bit,'' he said to the laughing crowd.
 &HT;    The aides who have helped engineer the turnabout in public
opinion are encouraged about the future. ``We find doors flying
open everywhere now where we had to really struggle before,'' one
said.
 &HT;    Though the recognition of the prince's pioneering
accomplishments and the public sympathy for him as a single parent
have given him new balance, Charles can still stumble over his
bulky collection of resentments.
 &HT;    There is, first and foremost, the somewhat icy, always
complicated relationship with his parents. It is clear too that the
prince has not fully freed himself from the sense of anger he felt
a year ago at being cast as a villain who betrayed a saint, a
careless adulterer who married a virgin for dynastic reasons and
then destroyed her emotionally.
 &HT;    ``You know the prince thought that Diana was on a mission to
destroy him,'' one courtier explained. He recalled a night in which
Charles could talk of nothing else until the aide, a relative
newcomer to the staff, said: ``You can't keep going on like this.
You must get on with your future.''
 &HT;    The prince agreed that he was being ``obsessive'' but insisted
on talking on. ``Unless you hear what went on in the past,'' he
said, ``you won't understand how I am today.''
 &HT;    How he is today, friends say, is a lot more pleasant than he
used to be, and the behavior figures prominently in his
rehabilitation.
 &HT;    ``He's actually doing the same things he did before,'' said a
Prince's Trust executive, ``but he is much more relaxed and
confident that he can do things on his own. It helps not having
someone out there saying, 'I can do that better than you can.'''
 &HT;    Of course, he is still far from taming his notorious moodiness
or mastering his tantrums, but the best antidote to them, Camilla
Parker Bowles, is more frequently at hand.
 &HT;    ``He is a world-class, wall-to-wall whinger,'' one of his
closest aides said, invoking the English word for whining that
makes self-pity sound even more insufferable.
 &HT;    A woman who heads up one of his charities looked aghast at the
recollection of a moment when she lost patience with the prince and
apparently lost track of whom she was speaking to. ``He does moan
about so,'' she said. ``One day I just said to him: 'Stop
complaining. We all have problem parents.'''

   CIR-FUZZY-COMPUTERS (Undated) _ Arthur and D.W. look for all the
world like simple stuffed toys based on the aardvarks from PBS's
most popular children's show, ``Arthur.'' But these two 21-inch
figures, called Actimates, are not just toys: they are furry
computer peripherals. But Arthur and D.W. are not alone. This fall
has seen the release of a menagerie of fuzzy computers, like My
Interactive Pooh ($99.99) by Mattel and two less expensive toys,
Furby ($34.99) from Tiger Electronics and Real Live Babe ($40), a
toy pig from Equity Toys based on the movie character. All these
dolls offer varying levels of interactivity and differing claims
about educational value. But the educational value of these kinds
of interactive toys is a matter of keen debate among
child-development experts. By Ian Austen.

NUTS ABOUT CHEF GRADY SPEARS' SPICY PECANS? READ ON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``My family loves the pecans Reata serves on their salad. Does
anyone know how those are prepared?'' writes Joann Bresciani from
Crowley, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was chef Grady Spears happy to share his recipe for the
nuts served at his Fort Worth reataurant, he's also sharing many of
his recipes in ``A Cowboy in the Kitchen: Recipes From Reata and
Texas West of the Pecos'' (10 Speed Press, $29.95). The book is hot
off the press and will not be available in bookstores until
January. However, it is for sale at the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   SPICY PECANS
</P>
<P>
   Serves 8
</P>
<P>
   4 cups pecan halves
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons pasilla powder, see Note
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup packed brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   Note: Make pasilla powder by removing the stem and seeds from 5
pasilla chiles. Toast peppers in skillet over medium heat for 5
minutes, turning them often until they are dry and crisp, but not
burned. Puree the peppers in a coffee grinder until they become a
fine powder.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In large bowl, toss pecans with
butter until well-coated. Toss chile powder and brown sugar with
nuts. Sift with fingers. Place on baking sheet and bake for 10-20
minutes. (The length of time may vary, depending on your oven.)
Bake until sugar begins to caramelize. The coating will not be
crunchy at this time, but coating will harden as the nuts cool.
These can be used as croutons on salads or set out for holiday
snacks. Store in airtight container.

ANALYSTS SEE CHEVRON RESISTING MERGER MANIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WENDY TANAKA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Chevron Corp., the offshoot of the old Standard
Oil of California, is unlikely to be swept into the momentum of
consolidation in the oil industry, a company official and industry
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon Corp. announced Tuesday that it agreed to acquire Mobil
Corp. for about $80 billion in stock, raising the likelihood of
more mergers in the competitive world oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at things constantly. Selling assets and acquiring
assets is part of our business,'' said Dawn Soper, spokeswoman for
the San Francisco-based Chevron.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Soper hastened to add that the trend of huge mergers might
not be right for Chevron.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of speculation out there,'' she said, ``but the
continued speculation that you have to be bigger is not a
philosophy we subscribe to.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts who monitor the oil industry concurred, saying
that all the big oil and gas mergers had been put in play. In
addition to the Exxon-Mobil deal, British Petroleum Co. agreed in
August to buy Amoco Corp. in a transaction valued at $48.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Eisenbarth, an analyst at Collins &AMP; Co., a San
Francisco-based brokerage firm, said one potential suitor of
Chevron is Royal Dutch/Shell in the United Kingdom. Eisenbarth said
Royal Dutch/Shell had a market value or capitalization of about
$100 billion, compared with Chevron's $53 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as market cap goes, (Chevron's) at the top of the
list,'' he said. ``It would be an expensive pill to swallow.''
</P>
<P>
   A more likely scenario is that Chevron could be a potential
buyer of a smaller refiner like the Atlantic Richfield Co., or
Arco, which has a market value of about $22 billion and a
significant presence in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Another option for Chevron is not to do anything at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chevron would be fine for the time being,'' said Jennifer
Gordon, a Baltimore-based analyst at BT Alex. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of reducing costs to compete with other oil giants,
Eisenbarth said Chevron already was a very lean operator. With
39,700 workers, the company has about half the employees it did a
decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're one of the low-cost producers right now,'' Eisenbarth
said. ``Chevron doesn't want to scale down operations too far
because it gets to the point where you jeopardize revenues. But
(cost) benchmarks could be reset once the operating structures of
the recently merged companies are hashed out.''
</P>
<P>
   The heads of Exxon and Mobil said they could better compete as
one company in a global market faced with declining prices and
stiff competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole oil industry's in a tough situation,'' Eisenbarth
said. ``Profitability is under fire right now. There's a global
glut of oil on the market. ... That's the catalyst that gets
consolidation going. But Chevron is not going to do anything to the
detriment of its shareholders. They're not going out of business,
merger or not.''
</P>
<P>
   What's most clear is that any move Chevron makes shouldn't bore
a hole in consumer pockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prices at the pump are more determined by supply and demand of
gasoline,'' Eisenbarth said. ``From a consumer perspective, the
impact would be minimal.''
</P>
<P>
   Chevron, like Exxon and Mobil, is an offshoot of the Standard
Oil Co. founded by John D. Rockefeller in 1870. In a landmark
antitrust case, that oil empire was broken up in 1911, creating a
series of separate companies.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon and Mobil are the largest pieces of the old Standard Oil.
If the deal is approved by regulators and stockholders, the
combined operation, to be called Exxon Mobil, would eclipse Royal
Dutch/Shell as the world's largest oil company.

   MUSEUM-SHOPS (Undated) _ Some gift shops have nice museums
attached. Giant flags wave in front of New York's Museum of Natural
History beckoning the public to Vodou, its exhibition of the sacred
arts of Haiti. Inside, cash registers are ringing up sales of
Haitian arts and crafts made of tin, glass and sequins at the Vodou
shop that's been set up for the duration of the show. At the
Philadelphia Museum of Art, a special shop has been created for its
current Delacroix show. Museums large and small have come to depend
on the profits of their shops now that so much public and private
funding of the arts has dried up. By Marianne Rohrlich.

   KALMAN-DESIGN (Undated) _ Thirty years ago the designer Tibor
Kalman showed up. Kalman's brilliance has been to sustain,
throughout his career, a tirade against oppression and for
intellectual freedom. He has maintained that tirade with fearless
biting humor and a legendary, often withering grumpiness toward
those who disagree with him. Kalman's visual manifestoes rail
against technological hyperbole and other fetishes about ``the
Future.'' His work in advertising, journalism and graphic design
constitutes a eulogy for the single clear voice. That voice, a
blunt water cannon, has delighted in hosing down storm-troopers of
style and fashion around the globe. By John Hockenberry.
</P>
<P>
   RUDOLPH-ARCHITECTURE (New York) _ Modernism can be dangerous.
Just ask Cremilda Conceicao, whose forehead and sweatpants bear the
battle scars of fourteen years of cleaning the see-through
elevator, the transparent sinks and some 17 levels of plexiglass
walkways and chrome-plated I-beams that snake bewilderingly through
the late architect Paul Rudolph's Beekman Place triplex, perhaps
the city's most unusual apartment.

   SEE-THROUGH-CAMERA (Undated) _ Rarely has an urban legend been
born so quickly and openly as the tale that Sony's NightShot video
camera could see through clothes. Jay Leno joked about it: ``Hear
about this new video camera that looks through clothes? Well, Sony
has recalled it _ and raised the price.'' The titillating tale
rippled through the news media like snickers through a sophomore
science class. It had only the tiniest grain of truth: in skilled
hands, during the day, under just the right conditions, with just
the right (gauzy) fabrics, it might be possible to produce an image
of a body beneath. The camera could not, of course, see through
clothes, and there was no recall. By Phil Patton.

   FANTASY-CAKE-DECORATOR (New York) _ The call came in from the
White House on Nov. 10. Could Colette Peters, fantasy cake
decorator to Bette Midler, Whoopi Goldberg, Al Pacino, Joan Rivers
and Rockefeller Center, make edible Christmas decorations for the
mantels in the Red Room and the Green Room and for the Grand Foyer.
And could she have them installed by Saturday night, Dec. 5? Not
too many people say no to the White House. Neither did Ms. Peters,
who gave up a career as a painter _ that thing about making a
living _ to bake and decorate cakes for the rich and famous. The
latter turned out to provide a very nice living. By Marian Burros.
</P>
<P>
   TIFFANY-WINDOWS (New York) _ When you enter the long nave of St.
James African Methodist Episcopal Church here, there is a deep,
rich glow near the altar, coming from windows that pulsate with
color and light. The dazzling interplay of emerald greens, dark
blues, ambers and rubies inspires a feeling verging on rapture.
Anyone seeing these six windows will wonder if they are by Louis
Comfort Tiffany. The answer is a definite ``maybe'' and, in fact,
the mystery may never be resolved. By Caroline Seehohm.

RECIPES FOR YUMMY CHICKEN AND DUMPLINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's obvious from our mail who a family's best chicken and
dumplings cook is: someone from a previous generation.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Griffis e-mailed the recipe for old-fashioned rolled
dumplings. It's from her grandmother, Pearl George of Columbia, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   The second recipe is from Bessie Long of Weatherford, texas. She
says her mother-in-law made the best chicken and dumplings but
never used a recipe. A daughter-in-law watched as she made the
dumplings and wrote down each ingredient.
</P>
<P>
   GRANDMA'S ROLLED DUMPLINGS
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4
</P>
<P>
   1 egg
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups unsifted flour
</P>
<P>
   Beat first 5 ingredients together with a fork. Add flour and
beat until stiff. Roll very thin on floured board, cut into
1-by-3-inch strips with pizza cutter and drop into 6 cups of
boiling broth to which boned, cut-up chicken has been added. Cook
10 minutes over medium heat. Recipe can be doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Hint for cooking chicken for dumplings: Never boil the chicken
in water alone. Always add salt, black pepper, a touch of onion, a
little garlic powder and either thyme or marjoram. Just a touch of
turmeric also adds great flavor, but don't add too much, or your
broth will be too yellow.
</P>

ever eat.''

of De Leon, Texas, who discovered this recipe in ``Potluck on the
Pedernales.'' She made it for her husband, who doesn't like
broccoli. Not only did he eat it, he bragged on it.

<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Mountains of waste will soon be heaped into the
newest trash pit at Hunter Ferrell Landfill, but for now, the hole
is home to a prehistoric prize. Nestled 60 feet under the landfill
are fossilized pieces of an 8- to 12-foot-long xiphactinus, a
menacing fish with razor-sharp teeth and powerful jaws that roamed
waterways 90 million years ago. By DIANE SMITH. Story will move in

</P>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The Exxon-Mobil deal is all about Big Oil,
and that makes it a big deal in Texas. But Little Oil is standing
by to pick up the leftovers, and that, too, is a big deal in Texas.
That's because the huge, integrated multinationals such as Exxon
and Mobil have been doing a long, slow retreat from Texas and the
U.S. midcontinent over the past two decades in favor of new plays
in the former Soviet Union, China and Southeast Asia. By DAN

   MERGER-LEADERS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ On paper, they seem so similar. In the flesh, they
seem very different. Lee Raymond and Lucio Noto, the chief
executives of Exxon and Mobil, respectively, joined their companies
in the early 1960s within a year of each other. They spent time
working abroad and then, after displaying financial skills, climbed
through the ranks at home. Roughly 30 years after joining their
organizations, each was named chairman and chief executive _ again,
within 12 months of each other. Now, with both at age 60 and with
the oil industry in the throes of extensive consolidation, the
paths of Raymond and Noto have converged, with the agreement to
combine their companies in the biggest merger in history. By

<P>
   MERGER-TEXAS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ If the merger of oil giants Exxon and Mobil
is approved, North Texas will be home to the world's biggest
corporation. But the region might have to accept some job cuts
along with the distinction. For example, Mobil Corp. employs 2,300
at a production research center in Farmers Branch and at a Dallas
data center. But Exxon Corp., which is based in Irving's Las
Colinas area, also has a production research center. It's in
Houston, the site of Exxon's U.S. production headquarters and the
designated home of the merged company's world production and
chemical operations. By JIM FUQUAY and ANDREW BACKOVER. Story will

</P>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ It's a long way from the Mobil Corp.
boardroom to Dennis Heiser's Mobil station on Loop 820 in North
Richland Hills. Heiser has run the dealership for 23 years and has
long enjoyed a companionable relationship with the owner of the
Exxon across the street. Now, after Exxon and Mobil's megamerger,
the Exxon station on the opposite corner will be a brother business
to Heiser's Mobil station. What that means for dealers and
consumers remains in question. By BILL BOWEN. Story will move in

complex, which dominates the horizon west of Las Colinas' pink
granite towers. The 360,000-square-foot complex can accommodate
hundreds of additional workers who could be shifted as a result of
the Exxon-Mobil merger, according to real estate observers and
local chamber officials. And if they can't be squeezed into the
main office, which already houses about 300 employees, the company
also has 30 acres on which it can build nearby. By MILES MOFFEIT.

PECAN TREES SHELLED OUT A SPARSE CROP THIS YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEATHERFORD, Texas _ At Weatherford's public market, just east
of the Parker County Courthouse, this is the time of year when
shoppers do their annual dance of the pecan.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, there are sacks and sacks of pecans, piled up like
sandbags holding back a river of pie bakers and candy-makers. The
shoppers move deftly between the sacks, grabbing a sample here,
another taste there.
</P>
<P>
   In the background, a sheller pounds out the beat.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, the dance floor is far less crowded. The drought
is once again showing its effect. The pounding sheller goes silent
for hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drought really hurt,'' said Michelle Dunn, who with her
husband, Jim, runs Dunn Produce at the market. ``It's not like it
has been in years past, but it can't be helped.''
</P>
<P>
   There are still mountains of bags stacked in a corner of the
market, and the Dunns have done their best to display their finest
nuts. But being people who rely heavily on the pecan harvest for
their livelihood at this time of year, they are obviously
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the irrigated farms didn't do that well,'' Michelle Dunn
said. ``We thought that would make the difference, but it didn't. I
am not an expert on growing pecans, but I think it was more than
just the lack of water; it was the high temperatures as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pawnee pecans were good, she said. They came in late
September, and they have already disappeared. Apparently, some
shoppers understood what was going on and jumped on the early crop.
</P>
<P>
   Now, only Cheyenne, Wichita and Kiowa are left. Their quality
has been damaged by the drought.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get a 55 percent yield on the pecans,'' she said.
``That means that out of 10 pounds of pecans, we will get 5.5
pounds of meat; the rest is shell. That is kind of our standard.
This year, we're seeing 47 percent in the Cheyennes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Choctaws _ a thin-shelled pecan with a meaty flavor _ didn't
even show up this year. The tasty Desirables were the same. Dunn
said they are hoping that some Burkets would be coming in late, but
doubt that it will happen.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, the Dunns said, lots of people pick up pecans in nearby
parks and fields _ just looking for some extra spending money. But
this year, they haven't shown up either.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even with the rows and rows of varieties missing, the
Dunns insist that what they do have is better than the pre-packaged
pecans in the grocery stores.
</P>
<P>
   For years, pecan growers have tried to persuade grocers to put
pecans in refrigerated areas to keep them from drying out, but to
no avail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to sound too negative,'' Michelle Dunn said.
``Actually, the average person might not be able to tell too much
of a difference between this year's crop and last. The pecans we
have are good; we just don't have as many as we would like.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the Wichitas have a high oil content and are good for
baking; the Cheyennes are light-colored and look very good as a
garnish.
</P>
<P>
   All of them, along with California walnuts, almonds and mixed
nuts, look good in Christmas baskets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do a big business in fruit baskets,'' she said. ``We get a
majority of the fruit-basket business from the churches around
here. We'll have grapefruit and oranges, apples, and lots of fresh
persimmons.''
</P>
<P>
   The most common use for pecans is still pecan pie; here is one
of the most often-used recipes. It is from the folks who make Karo
syrup, the syrup commonly used in pecan pies.

   CIR-FUZZY-COMPUTERS (Undated) _ Arthur and D.W. look for all the
world like simple stuffed toys based on the aardvarks from PBS's
most popular children's show, ``Arthur.'' But these two 21-inch
figures, called Actimates, are not just toys: they are furry
computer peripherals. But Arthur and D.W. are not alone. This fall
has seen the release of a menagerie of fuzzy computers, like My
Interactive Pooh ($99.99) by Mattel and two less expensive toys,
Furby ($34.99) from Tiger Electronics and Real Live Babe ($40), a
toy pig from Equity Toys based on the movie character. All these
dolls offer varying levels of interactivity and differing claims
about educational value. But the educational value of these kinds
of interactive toys is a matter of keen debate among
child-development experts. By Ian Austen.

Haitian arts and crafts made of tin, glass and sequins at the Vodou
shop that's been set up for the duration of the show. At the
Philadelphia Museum of Art, a special shop has been created for its

   KALMAN-DESIGN (Undated) _ Thirty years ago the designer Tibor
Kalman showed up. Kalman's brilliance has been to sustain,
throughout his career, a tirade against oppression and for
intellectual freedom. He has maintained that tirade with fearless
biting humor and a legendary, often withering grumpiness toward
those who disagree with him. Kalman's visual manifestoes rail
against technological hyperbole and other fetishes about ``the
Future.'' His work in advertising, journalism and graphic design
constitutes a eulogy for the single clear voice. That voice, a
blunt water cannon, has delighted in hosing down storm-troopers of

   SEE-THROUGH-CAMERA (Undated) _ Rarely has an urban legend been
born so quickly and openly as the tale that Sony's NightShot video
camera could see through clothes. Jay Leno joked about it: ``Hear
about this new video camera that looks through clothes? Well, Sony
has recalled it _ and raised the price.'' The titillating tale
rippled through the news media like snickers through a sophomore
science class. It had only the tiniest grain of truth: in skilled
hands, during the day, under just the right conditions, with just
the right (gauzy) fabrics, it might be possible to produce an image
of a body beneath. The camera could not, of course, see through
clothes, and there was no recall. By Phil Patton.

decorator to Bette Midler, Whoopi Goldberg, Al Pacino, Joan Rivers
and Rockefeller Center, make edible Christmas decorations for the
mantels in the Red Room and the Green Room and for the Grand Foyer.
And could she have them installed by Saturday night, Dec. 5? Not
too many people say no to the White House. Neither did Ms. Peters,
who gave up a career as a painter _ that thing about making a
living _ to bake and decorate cakes for the rich and famous. The
latter turned out to provide a very nice living. By Marian Burros.
</P>
<P>
   TIFFANY-WINDOWS (New York) _ When you enter the long nave of St.
James African Methodist Episcopal Church here, there is a deep,
rich glow near the altar, coming from windows that pulsate with
color and light. The dazzling interplay of emerald greens, dark
blues, ambers and rubies inspires a feeling verging on rapture.
Anyone seeing these six windows will wonder if they are by Louis
Comfort Tiffany. The answer is a definite ``maybe'' and, in fact,
the mystery may never be resolved. By Caroline Seehohm.

<P>
   LONDON _ When the year 2000 computer problem gained wide
recognition a couple of years ago, the first reaction was disbelief
that a computer's inability to distinguish 2000 from 1900 could
seriously disrupt modern life.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently, companies and governments around the globe have
spent tens of billions of dollars to replace computers, rewrite
decades-old software and test their equipment and operating
systems.
</P>
<P>
   But with only 400 days to go to 2000, there is a growing
realization that time is quickly running out.
</P>
<P>
   So today, governments and industry no longer talk simply about
fixing the millennium bug. They are actively preparing contingency
plans to keep vital operations going as best as they can if and
when problems arise.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point in time, we can say with assurance there are
people who aren't going to make it,'' said Michael Powell, a
commissioner at the U.S. Federal Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely past the period of where you're going to
solve the problem. We're into mitigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The new emphasis on anticipating failures reflects the
unprecedented nature of the year 2000 problem. The pervasiveness of
technology and the complexity of supply chains can cause problems
to cascade through the global economy, disrupting business
activity, communications and transportation networks, and basic
services like power and water.
</P>
<P>
   While multinational companies and banks appear well-prepared,
many government agencies and companies, especially small
businesses, are behind schedule or have yet to address the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be ready,'' said Max Rens, chief information officer of
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. But, he added, referring to Europe's
patchwork of air-traffic control systems, ``we can't fly if they
are not ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The steps being taken range from the mundane, like restocking
forms to be able to revert to paper if computerized order systems
fail, to the strategic, such as finding alternative suppliers of
parts or stockpiling raw materials and finished goods, which
companies like Unilever are considering.
</P>
<P>
   American and British authorities are drawing up plans for police
and emergency services to respond to widespread disruptions or
civil unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Even the U.S. Federal Reserve has gotten into action, ordering
the printing of an extra $50 billion of notes in case consumers
hoard cash ahead of the millennium bug weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contingency planning should be considered a legitimate
exercise and not an admission that you expect failure,'' said Roger
Ferguson, a member of the Fed's board of governors and chairman of
the presidential Year 2000 Council.
</P>
<P>
   The current state of preparedness underscores the need for
contingency arrangements. Gartner Group, a U.S. consultancy that
conducts the broadest assessment of year 2000 preparations, warned
last month that 23 percent of the companies it surveys in 87
countries had not started any work on the problem, a worrying sign,
as it takes the average medium-sized company a full 30 months to
make all its critical operations year 2000 compliant.
</P>
<P>
   Gartner predicted that one-third to one-half of companies and
government agencies worldwide would experience a disruption to
operations severe enough to halt production or product delivery,
cause a significant loss of revenue or legal liability, or pose a
health hazard.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, where remedial efforts are believed to be
among the most advanced, disruptions were expected to hit as many
as 15 percent of companies and agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem continues to be underestimated, and full-scale
actions to address it are only recently beginning in many
countries,'' the Organization of Economic Cooperation and
Development warned in a similar report.
</P>
<P>
   Half of OECD member countries have begun drawing up contingency
plans to deal with year 2000 problems, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Although no one can be sure where problems will arise or how
severe they will be, a consensus is developing that problems will
stop short of catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   Gartner predicted that 90 percent of disruptions will be
resolved within three days, and many companies are making
contingencies for relatively short disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus Industrie, which flies aircraft parts from member
companies in Britain, Germany and Spain to the consortium's final
assembly plant in Toulouse, France, is planning to stockpile one or
two weeks' worth of parts in Toulouse before Dec. 31, 1999, to
safeguard production in case Europe's skies are closed by a failure
of air-traffic control systems, according to Helga Flosdorff, the
company's year 2000 project manager.
</P>
<P>
   Unilever, the British-Dutch consumer products group, is sitting
down with key suppliers to assess their compliance before deciding,
sometime early next year, whether to stockpile raw materials or
finished goods. But the company already is lining up backup
communications facilities with satellite companies such as Inmarsat
and Iridium, said Nick White, head of technology and
communications.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Coast Guard is considering stockpiling such vital spare
parts as rotors for its fleet, said George Naccara, the service's
chief information officer. ``We have found suppliers who have said,
`We will go out of business on Dec. 31.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard also has ordered 10,000 inspection forms to be
printed in case its computerized ship-inspection system crashes,
and it is considering deploying its ships in all major U.S. ports
so their satellite communications can be used as a backup in case
telephone service breaks down.
</P>
<P>
   While anticipating technical problems is difficult, trying to
predict the behavior of consumers is even more fraught with risk.
Two Hollywood studios are believed to be preparing year 2000
disaster films for release next summer.
</P>
<P>
   The American Association of Retired People has urged members to
have $1,000 in cash for every person in their household.
</P>
<P>
   Even Gartner, which warns against a ``bomb-shelter mentality,''
is advising people to fill their gasoline tanks, set aside two
weeks' salary in cash and stock batteries, medicines and a week's
worth of food.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm often asked, `Will there be a dial tone?''' said Powell of
the communications commission. His answer: ``Yes, unless you and
everyone else picks up the phone to check.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell is encouraging U.S. telephone companies to enter
mutual-assistance pacts to provide stopgap service in case of year
2000 failures. Many business executives maintain such government
efforts to ensure the reliability of power, communications and
transportation networks will be vital to preventing a panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public confidence in the infrastructure will affect consumer
behavior,'' White of Unilever said.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson of the Federal Reserve downplayed the prospect of
panic. While the risk of market disruption is real, he said, banks
and financial institutions have led the way in preparing for a fix
for the millennium bug. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the American people will believe the year 2000
disaster story any more than they believed Alfred Hitchcock,'' he
said. &QL;

<P>
   It's better than Tetris.
</P>
<P>
   Tetris has been the best puzzle game on the planet for a decade.
But Devil Dice is definitely better. If you play it enough, it gets
into your dreams. And even in dreams it looks and plays better than
Tetris.
</P>
<P>
   As with Tetris, the rules are simple. The game takes place on a
7-by-7 grid scattered with dice, with an impish devil bobbing and
dancing above. The object is to eliminate the dice by using your
devil to flip them from square to square so matching numbers
connect facing up: two 2s, three 3s, four 4s, five 5s or six 6s.
</P>
<P>
   Once aligned, these chains of dice begin sinking into the floor.
If you connect a matching number to the dice as they sink, you get
that number added to your score, plus a multiple of the value of
the whole chain.
</P>
<P>
   The more dice you add, the higher the multiple. Meanwhile, new
dice are rising from the floor, and the difficulty level is
constantly escalating. The more dice you eliminate, the faster they
rise. When the entire grid fills up, you're dead.
</P>
<P>
   Two players can cooperate to rack up the score and clear the
board. But Battle Mode is much more fun. You can earn extra points
by rolling dice over your opponent _ your bonus depends on the
number facing up as the cube squashes the other player underfoot.
(Your devil squeals with glee and dances a little jig while that is
happening.)
</P>
<P>
   Wars Mode is a five-way free-for-all in which every chain of
dice you string together subtracts from the other players' scores.
As long as the dice are sinking, anyone on the board can compound
the damage, wreaking havoc on everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   In this time-critical action scenario, concepts like ``geometric
progression'' assume a certain urgency. Subtraction becomes a
visceral experience. Arithmetic becomes a form of aggression.
</P>
<P>
   In this context, numbers become tangible, dynamic, emotional _
everything that chalkboard numbers are not. They have a physical
dimension that is completely missing in textbook math. When you
have to roll dice into a particular configuration, you realize that
they're not just cube-shaped random number generators. They have a
geometry. And you have to understand that geometry because the
relationship between those numbers in space defines the game play.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the opposite sides of a die always add to seven.
So a three-sided view is enough to know which number will face up
as the die moves in any direction. You complete the image in your
head because you always know what's on the hidden side.
</P>
<P>
   One number implies another. At some point, we've all gnawed on
this concept. We need it to understand things like exponents. Of
course, it's much more intuitive in the context of a game (most
things are). But plenty of flash-card exercises have been dressed
up with pretty graphics, and none of them are fun.
</P>
<P>
   Devil Dice isn't fun because it's colorful or because it has
great music. It's fun because it makes something abstract into
something tangible, something you can knock around, patterns you
can play with.
</P>
<P>
   It also restores the link between numbers and fingers, which
goes back as far as any of us can remember counting. As Stanislas
Dehaene wrote in ``The Number Sense: How the Mind Creates
Mathematics'' (Oxford University Press, 1997): ``Historically,
digits and other parts of the body have supported a body-based
language of numbers. In countless languages throughout the world,
from Central Africa to Paraguay, the etymology of the word `five'
evokes the word `hand.'''
</P>
<P>
   Numbers and fingers belong together _ we count in base 10 for a
reason. And while you are not counting on your fingers when you
play Devil Dice, you are manipulating numbers with a video-game
controller. So it feels just as comfortable, and just as natural,
more like playing a musical instrument from memory than calculating
sums on paper.
</P>
<P>
   It's curiously synesthetic as well because each side of the die
is color-coded. So you are operating in an environment where aqua
corresponds to the image of four dots, the number 4 and the
opposite of royal blue, which is 3.
</P>
<P>
   And there comes a point, as the action accelerates, when numbers
and colors become functionally equivalent. Two times yellow is four
because you do not have time to separate those concepts. As Dehaene
observed, the area of the human brain that transforms numerical
symbols into quantities also processes information about color and
location.
</P>
<P>
   With all circuits firing simultaneously at high speed, someone
gunning for a record score might experience some mental blur.
</P>
<P>
   But that's what's so great about video games. They show what
your brain can do when it doesn't have to bother with words. Video
games may require virtuosic timing, spatial logic and strategy, but
none of that needs to be expressed verbally.
</P>
<P>
   So there's a quicker turnaround from stimulus to response.
There's less interpretation. Less friction. Less waste.
Problem-solving becomes streamlined and fluid. And fast. Faster
than you can blink.
</P>
<P>
   That's why it's so compelling. Because where else does your
brain work that well? In a video game, the line between logic and
instinct is so thin that it seems to disappear. Your grasp of
abstract problems is instant and complete, and almost palpable.
That's the kind of understanding we attribute to ``pure thinkers'':
scientists, mathematicians, musicians and artists.
</P>
<P>
   And if video games do anything radical, it will be to
democratize that sort of mental experience. If nothing else, they
remove the stigma from thinking hard and liking it.
</P>
<P>
   And we learn, despite ourselves, because any game (digital or
analog) is a machine for learning. We don't generally acknowledge
this because we equate learning with instruction, and games don't
instruct. But there is a big difference between instruction and
learning.
</P>
<P>
   In a game, you learn because simple rules have a way of
combining in complicated ways. And you learn how to maneuver in
that complexity, and you learn how to learn. Because every game is
a different system, and after playing six or a dozen or a hundred
of them, you get good at figuring out new systems.
</P>
<P>
   Systems theory is no longer an arcane academic pursuit. It is
literally child's play.
</P>
<P>
   Flash cards are dorky and boring. Video games are cool.
</P>
<P>
   Viva Devil Dice. &QL;

   LONDON _ When the year 2000 computer problem gained wide
recognition a couple of years ago, the first reaction was disbelief
that a computer's inability to distinguish 2000 from 1900 could
seriously disrupt modern life.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently, companies and governments around the globe have
spent tens of billions of dollars to replace computers, rewrite
decades-old software and test their equipment and operating
systems.
</P>
<P>
   But with only 400 days to go to 2000, there is a growing
realization that time is quickly running out.
</P>
<P>
   So today, governments and industry no longer talk simply about
fixing the millennium bug. They are actively preparing contingency
plans to keep vital operations going as best as they can if and
when problems arise.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point in time, we can say with assurance there are
people who aren't going to make it,'' said Michael Powell, a
commissioner at the U.S. Federal Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely past the period of where you're going to
solve the problem. We're into mitigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The new emphasis on anticipating failures reflects the
unprecedented nature of the year 2000 problem. The pervasiveness of
technology and the complexity of supply chains can cause problems
to cascade through the global economy, disrupting business
activity, communications and transportation networks, and basic
services like power and water.
</P>
<P>
   While multinational companies and banks appear well-prepared,
many government agencies and companies, especially small
businesses, are behind schedule or have yet to address the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be ready,'' said Max Rens, chief information officer of
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. But, he added, referring to Europe's
patchwork of air-traffic control systems, ``we can't fly if they
are not ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The steps being taken range from the mundane, like restocking
forms to be able to revert to paper if computerized order systems
fail, to the strategic, such as finding alternative suppliers of
parts or stockpiling raw materials and finished goods, which
companies like Unilever are considering.
</P>
<P>
   American and British authorities are drawing up plans for police
and emergency services to respond to widespread disruptions or
civil unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Even the U.S. Federal Reserve has gotten into action, ordering
the printing of an extra $50 billion of notes in case consumers
hoard cash ahead of the millennium bug weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contingency planning should be considered a legitimate
exercise and not an admission that you expect failure,'' said Roger
Ferguson, a member of the Fed's board of governors and chairman of
the presidential Year 2000 Council.
</P>
<P>
   The current state of preparedness underscores the need for
contingency arrangements. Gartner Group, a U.S. consultancy that
conducts the broadest assessment of year 2000 preparations, warned
last month that 23 percent of the companies it surveys in 87
countries had not started any work on the problem, a worrying sign,
as it takes the average medium-sized company a full 30 months to
make all its critical operations year 2000 compliant.
</P>
<P>
   Gartner predicted that one-third to one-half of companies and
government agencies worldwide would experience a disruption to
operations severe enough to halt production or product delivery,
cause a significant loss of revenue or legal liability, or pose a
health hazard.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, where remedial efforts are believed to be
among the most advanced, disruptions were expected to hit as many
as 15 percent of companies and agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem continues to be underestimated, and full-scale
actions to address it are only recently beginning in many
countries,'' the Organization of Economic Cooperation and
Development warned in a similar report.
</P>
<P>
   Half of OECD member countries have begun drawing up contingency
plans to deal with year 2000 problems, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Although no one can be sure where problems will arise or how
severe they will be, a consensus is developing that problems will
stop short of catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   Gartner predicted that 90 percent of disruptions will be
resolved within three days, and many companies are making
contingencies for relatively short disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus Industrie, which flies aircraft parts from member
companies in Britain, Germany and Spain to the consortium's final
assembly plant in Toulouse, France, is planning to stockpile one or
two weeks' worth of parts in Toulouse before Dec. 31, 1999, to
safeguard production in case Europe's skies are closed by a failure
of air-traffic control systems, according to Helga Flosdorff, the
company's year 2000 project manager.
</P>
<P>
   Unilever, the British-Dutch consumer products group, is sitting
down with key suppliers to assess their compliance before deciding,
sometime early next year, whether to stockpile raw materials or
finished goods. But the company already is lining up backup
communications facilities with satellite companies such as Inmarsat
and Iridium, said Nick White, head of technology and
communications.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Coast Guard is considering stockpiling such vital spare
parts as rotors for its fleet, said George Naccara, the service's
chief information officer. ``We have found suppliers who have said,
`We will go out of business on Dec. 31.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard also has ordered 10,000 inspection forms to be
printed in case its computerized ship-inspection system crashes,
and it is considering deploying its ships in all major U.S. ports
so their satellite communications can be used as a backup in case
telephone service breaks down.
</P>
<P>
   While anticipating technical problems is difficult, trying to
predict the behavior of consumers is even more fraught with risk.
Two Hollywood studios are believed to be preparing year 2000
disaster films for release next summer.
</P>
<P>
   The American Association of Retired People has urged members to
have $1,000 in cash for every person in their household.
</P>
<P>
   Even Gartner, which warns against a ``bomb-shelter mentality,''
is advising people to fill their gasoline tanks, set aside two
weeks' salary in cash and stock batteries, medicines and a week's
worth of food.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm often asked, `Will there be a dial tone?''' said Powell of
the communications commission. His answer: ``Yes, unless you and
everyone else picks up the phone to check.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell is encouraging U.S. telephone companies to enter
mutual-assistance pacts to provide stopgap service in case of year
2000 failures. Many business executives maintain such government
efforts to ensure the reliability of power, communications and
transportation networks will be vital to preventing a panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public confidence in the infrastructure will affect consumer
behavior,'' White of Unilever said.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson of the Federal Reserve downplayed the prospect of
panic. While the risk of market disruption is real, he said, banks
and financial institutions have led the way in preparing for a fix
for the millennium bug. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the American people will believe the year 2000
disaster story any more than they believed Alfred Hitchcock,'' he
said. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ According to a report before the Security Council,
23 United Nations staff members have lost their lives since July of
last year, and another 33 have been taken hostage or abducted. That
does not count the 31 killed in plane crashes. Nor does it count
locals who work for the United Nations, 60 of whom are detained or
missing.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the great silent scandals of our time.
</P>
<P>
   Relief workers, says the report, are ``threatened, robbed,
beaten, held hostage, stabbed, raped or murdered.'' It would be
hard to tell from the muted response.
</P>
<P>
   Governments are quick to protest U.N. wastage and withhold their
U.N. dues, but only 21 governments have committed themselves to the
protection of aid workers by ratifying the Convention on the Safety
of U.N. and Associated Personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The number of serious security incidents reported to the United
Nations since 1992 totals 162. Only one perpetrator has been
brought to justice.
</P>
<P>
   This lack of concern is less than surprising, since governments
are increasingly responsible for the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Relief workers have always been an easy target. Last year, Hutu
rebels took machetes to a group of U.N. human-rights monitors near
Cyangugu in Rwanda, and left their heads on the hood of the car.
This paralyzed the monitoring mission and gave the Hutu a virtual
license to kill west of Kigali.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of savagery is almost to be expected from groups which
place themselves outside the law. Not so, one would think, with
governments. Yet this report shows clearly that more and more
would-be governments view humanitarian aid workers as legitimate
targets as they cling to power or bludgeon critics into silence.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, after President Laurent Kabila of Congo
accused U.N. agencies of supporting the rebellion in the east,
UNICEF and UNHCR officials were threatened, abused and even
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   One local UNICEF official, Bernard Nsabimana, remains in
detention. All UNICEF field offices are provided with post-exposure
treatment for the AIDs virus since the rape of a staff member in
Congo.
</P>
<P>
   In Afghanistan, local employees of relief agencies have been
lashed for disobeying Taleban rules. International staffers were
publicly slapped and expelled for objecting to discrimination
against their women colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   In Rwanda, Tutsi employees of the United Nations were among the
first to be killed during the 1994 genocide. Hutu employees were
among the first to be arrested, when the Tutsi took control. Many
are still in jail.
</P>
<P>
   In southern Sudan, where U.N. officials are battling starvation
and war, the United Nations is forbidden to establish its own
communication system, which could greatly improve safety.
</P>
<P>
   In the Middle East, scores of local employees of the U.N. Relief
and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees have been detained in the
past year by Syria, Jordan and Israel. Fifteen were detained by the
Palestinian Authority in the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations can do little on its own. The peacekeeping
mission in Georgia proposed to set up a 294-strong protection unit,
but this was vetoed by the two warring parties.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has set up a trust fund to pay for improved
security for relief workers, but only Norway has contributed. The
United Nations even lacks funds to hire two stress counselors for
traumatized relief workers.
</P>
<P>
   As often in the humanitarian business, there are no easy
answers. The ultimate recourse is to withdraw, as relief agencies
have done from Congo, Afghanistan and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger dilemma is whether foreign officials should demand
special protection, when those whom they have come to help are so
helpless. Many are deeply uncomfortable at the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they agonize alone. There is no sense of urgency from the
U.N. Security Council, and nothing to suggest that governments will
bring those responsible to account.
</P>
<P>
   It is time for leadership from the U.N. Security Council, which

   WASHINGTON _ According to a report before the Security Council,
23 United Nations staff members have lost their lives since July of
last year, and another 33 have been taken hostage or abducted. That
does not count the 31 killed in plane crashes. Nor does it count
locals who work for the United Nations, 60 of whom are detained or
missing.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the great silent scandals of our time.
</P>
<P>
   Relief workers, says the report, are ``threatened, robbed,
beaten, held hostage, stabbed, raped or murdered.'' It would be
hard to tell from the muted response.
</P>
<P>
   Governments are quick to protest U.N. wastage and withhold their
U.N. dues, but only 21 governments have committed themselves to the
protection of aid workers by ratifying the Convention on the Safety
of U.N. and Associated Personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The number of serious security incidents reported to the United
Nations since 1992 totals 162. Only one perpetrator has been
brought to justice.
</P>
<P>
   This lack of concern is less than surprising, since governments
are increasingly responsible for the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Relief workers have always been an easy target. Last year, Hutu
rebels took machetes to a group of U.N. human-rights monitors near
Cyangugu in Rwanda, and left their heads on the hood of the car.
This paralyzed the monitoring mission and gave the Hutu a virtual
license to kill west of Kigali.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of savagery is almost to be expected from groups which
place themselves outside the law. Not so, one would think, with
governments. Yet this report shows clearly that more and more
would-be governments view humanitarian aid workers as legitimate
targets as they cling to power or bludgeon critics into silence.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, after President Laurent Kabila of Congo
accused U.N. agencies of supporting the rebellion in the east,
UNICEF and UNHCR officials were threatened, abused and even
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   One local UNICEF official, Bernard Nsabimana, remains in
detention. All UNICEF field offices are provided with post-exposure
treatment for the AIDs virus since the rape of a staff member in
Congo.
</P>
<P>
   In Afghanistan, local employees of relief agencies have been
lashed for disobeying Taleban rules. International staffers were
publicly slapped and expelled for objecting to discrimination
against their women colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   In Rwanda, Tutsi employees of the United Nations were among the
first to be killed during the 1994 genocide. Hutu employees were
among the first to be arrested, when the Tutsi took control. Many
are still in jail.
</P>
<P>
   In southern Sudan, where U.N. officials are battling starvation
and war, the United Nations is forbidden to establish its own
communication system, which could greatly improve safety.
</P>
<P>
   In the Middle East, scores of local employees of the U.N. Relief
and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees have been detained in the
past year by Syria, Jordan and Israel. Fifteen were detained by the
Palestinian Authority in the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations can do little on its own. The peacekeeping
mission in Georgia proposed to set up a 294-strong protection unit,
but this was vetoed by the two warring parties.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has set up a trust fund to pay for improved
security for relief workers, but only Norway has contributed. The
United Nations even lacks funds to hire two stress counselors for
traumatized relief workers.
</P>
<P>
   As often in the humanitarian business, there are no easy
answers. The ultimate recourse is to withdraw, as relief agencies
have done from Congo, Afghanistan and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger dilemma is whether foreign officials should demand
special protection, when those whom they have come to help are so
helpless. Many are deeply uncomfortable at the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they agonize alone. There is no sense of urgency from the
U.N. Security Council, and nothing to suggest that governments will
bring those responsible to account.
</P>
<P>
   It is time for leadership from the U.N. Security Council, which
often relies on humanitarian aid workers to bail it out of hot
spots. At this rate, there will be no more relief operations for
the Council to exploit. &QL;

JANE HORROCKS: 'LITTLE VOICE,' BIG TALENT 
</HEADLINE>
  World rights except Great Britain and Australia 
 Color slides and black and white photos of Jane Horrocks in
``Little Voice.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It was such a plum role that the ultra-hot Gwyneth Paltrow had
her eye on it. But British actress Jane Horrocks _ a virtual
unknown in Hollywood _ beat her to the punch.
 &HT;    As a result Horrocks has become a dark-horse Best Actress Oscar
contender for ``Little Voice,'' a British-made fable in which the
spotlight falls directly on the 34-year-old actress, best known for
her role as the ditzy Bubble in TV's U.K. comedy import
``Absolutely Fabulous.''
 &HT;    ``They were going to switch the film from England to America
with Gwyneth Paltrow, but it didn't work out,'' Horrocks said, her
voice brimming with happiness, in a telephone interview from New
York. ``So suddenly the part came back to me.''
 &HT;    In ``Little Voice,'' (opening Dec. 4 in New York, San Francisco
and Los Angeles, and on Christmas Day elsewhere) Horrocks is the
shy daughter of Brenda Blethyn (nominated for an Oscar for
``Secrets and Lies''), fearful of leaving the safety of her room
and her precious record collection. They call her Little Voice but
the girl packs a big talent. She can belt out a song and sound
exactly like Judy Garland, Marilyn Monroe, Shirley Bassey or
Marlene Dietrich _ to name a few.
 &HT;    It's a miraculous feat: Before your eyes Miss Meek is
transformed into a series of charismatic nightclub singers.
 &HT;    ``They had other people in mind for the lead,'' says Horrocks,
``but Jim Cartwright, who wrote the play, insisted he wanted me.''
In fact, she notes, Cartwright penned the play from which the movie
is drawn with her in mind.
 &HT;    ``I was in another play by him and we became friends,'' she
recalls. ``We were in my back garden one day and the subject of
impersonations came up. So I did a few for him. He said he would
write a play around me _ and two years later he did. I was
horrified and frightened to death to do the voices on stage. At the
time I hoped some disaster would come and take it away. But I did
the play for eight months, first at the National Theater then in
the West End.''
 &HT;    In the movie, Little Voice has to contend with her crude, rude
and hard-drinking mother (Blethyn), and with Michael Caine as the
sleazy agent who wants to exploit her talent. Ewan McGregor plays
her telephone repairman boyfriend.
 &HT;    What will astonish moviegoers is that Horrocks actually sings in
the voices of the legendary ladies; no tricks or miming are used.
``It was important to me and Mark Herman (the
screenwriter-director) that I actually sang because if the audience
thinks for a moment that the character is miming then you've lost
them.''
 &HT;    While she was impressive as an anorexic teenager in Mike Leigh's
``Life Is Sweet'' (1991) and has had roles in ``Memphis Belle''
(1990), ``The Witches'' and a slew of TV including her own British
comedy show ``Never Mind the Horrocks,'' the tiny Jane first caught
everyone's attention as the flaky PR girl in ``Ab-Fab.''
 &HT;    She auditioned first for the role of one of the character's
daughter but because she was too old for that part they hired her
to play Bubble. The show featuring the addled antics of a pair of
dipsomaniacs, quickly became a cult hit, and when it came to the
end of its run its devoted fans mourned. Of its future Jane says,
``Maybe they'll do a one-off special,'' using the British term for
a one-time TV presentation. ``The shows work well for 30 minutes
but I think they'd die in a two-hour movie.''
 &HT;    Her part as the dumb Bubble has had a considerable impact on her
career. ``It's made me more of a semi-household name, and given me
a lot of attention. But I'm not massively famous in the U.K. People
sometimes come up to me in the street and say, 'Oh, you're
So-and-so.' But it's not out of control. It's at a very nice
level.''
 &HT;    Unlike Bubble, Jane is no airhead. She lives in suburban London
with writer Nick Vivian and is expecting their second child. She's
not in favor of marriage, explaining: ``It doesn't appeal to me.
I'm happy as I am and feel if it ain't broke why fix it.''
 &HT;    She seems astonishingly natural on- and off-screen, but it
doesn't come as easily as all that. ``Like my character in the film
I'm a sort of reticent performer,'' she says. ``I don't feel
comfortable doing it. I don't consider myself an impersonator. I'm
an actress really. I began doing impersonations when I was about 9.
My parents had all these Shirley Bassey and Cilla Black records and
I was able to imitate them. Friends thought it was amazing so I
became this little party act. Garland and Monroe and Dietrich came
much later. ''
 &HT;    Now almost five months pregnant, (Dylan, her son with Vivian is
l8 months old) she says: ``I don't enjoy working as much as I used
to. I'd like to have more time for the momhood than the work. I'm
very fortunate because at home I've been able to do supermarket TV
commercials which doesn't take me away from home and pays the
bills. I'd love to retire.''
 &HT;    She says that however much she's been praised for her
impersonation, her son Dylan is often less than impressed. ``When I
did a Judy Garland for him he screamed his head off. He much
prefers my Julie Andrews.''

 By REGINALD DALE  
 c.1998 International Herald Tribune  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Why was Japan's artillery much more accurate than
its rifle-fire in World War II? Why do Japanese athletes, unlike
those of most other countries, perform better in trials for their
national Olympic team than in the Olympics themselves?
</P>
<P>
   According to a prominent Japanese sociologist, the answer to
both questions is the same: Japanese people do better when they are
not being observed by foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   The artillery was far behind the front-lines, out of sight of
the enemy, and only Japanese spectators watch Olympic trials while
the whole world watches the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   The sociologist first expounded this theory in the 1970s, since
when Japan has gotten much more used to being watched by foreigners
_ especially where its economic performance is concerned. But many
Japanese manifestly feel uncomfortable under a foreign microscope.
</P>
<P>
   Since its economy began stagnating seven years ago, Japan has
endured a deluge of criticism and advice, mostly from the United
States. Recent weeks have brought more of the same, with senior
U.S. officials savaging Japanese trade policy and President Bill
Clinton delivering milder admonishments during his recent visit to
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Some leading Japanese commentators now say the country's poor
economic performance, and foreign disapproval of it, are bringing
deep feelings of insecurity to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   The country's reaction to foreign pressure is complex. Sometimes
Japanese officials welcome it as a way of persuading public opinion
to accept unpopular decisions; sometimes they resent it. Lately,
resentment has been growing.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly these cultural factors need to be taken into account by
foreigners seeking to influence Japanese decisions. Grating against
a culture is usually counterproductive (witness U.S. attempts to
browbeat France), and there is no point in gratuitously alienating
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, there are two sides to most issues. Clinton may have a
point when he warns that the soaring Japanese trade surplus could
provoke calls for ``retaliatory protectionism'' in the United
States. But it is part of his job, not just Japan's, to keep
American protectionism at bay.
</P>
<P>
   The United States may be right that Japan has not done enough to
help its neighbors since the Asian economic crisis erupted last
year. But it was Washington that torpedoed Japan's original plans
for a big new Asian fund to help countries in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo was wrong to block further trade liberalization at the
summit meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum this
month. But it is right to point out that fast-growing America will
inevitably suck in more imports than slow-growing Japan.
</P>
<P>
   America is perfectly entitled to ask whether the Japanese
system, so effective when Japan was catching up with the West, is
capable of dealing with current problems. But many Americans tend
to forget that Japan's values and priorities are legitimately
different from their own.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, the Japanese will have to get used to
foreign attention. In today's interdependent world, the trend is
for the international community to intervene ever more intrusively
into what used to be regarded as a country's domestic economic and
political affairs.
</P>
<P>
   There is also nothing in Japan remotely resembling the huge
American policy-formation machine, a nexus of public and private
interests of every hue, that is constantly throwing out new
economic plans and ideas.
</P>
<P>
   As the world's third-largest economy after the United States and
the European Union, Japan must accept that its domestic policies
are a legitimate subject for foreign analysis and recommendations,
especially when they are not succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that if the Japanese find that those
recommendations clash too sharply with their culture and their
values, they should come up with more effective policies of their
own. &QL;

   SAN FRANCISCO _ A singing driver for the Municipal Railway has
been slapped on the wrist for disrupting the peace with his
renditions of soul classics.
</P>
<P>
   Cornelius Perdue, known as Dr. Love to his daily passengers on
the F-line, has been warned by his supervisors not to have his
train's outside speakers on when he serenades riders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just cautioned and reinstructed,'' said Perdue, 55.
``The voice continues. No problem. I can sing.''
</P>
<P>
   Perdue, who croons melodies from the likes of Marvin Gaye, Al
Green and other pop singers, faced suspension or other disciplinary
action when a resident of the city's Castro District complained
that Perdue refused to shut off his outdoor speakers when he was
asked to. The resident accused Perdue of insulting him in front of
passengers, alleging that Perdue called him a ``party pooper,'' a
statement that Perdue denied.
</P>
<P>
   Perdue said he could not shut the speaker system off during the
night of the confrontation because it was broken and he offered a
maintenance slip as proof of the defect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't rude to him,'' Perdue said. ``Everyone on that train
was mad at him. I'm the one that saved him. I closed the doors when
they wanted to get out and give him a piece of their mind. He broke
their spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Municipal Railway, or Muni, notified Perdue Tuesday that the
man's complaint was valid. Muni spokesman P.J. Johnston said he
could not comment on what disciplinary action was taken because it
was a confidential personnel matter.
</P>
<P>
   Muni supervisors have reiterated the policy that speakers on the
outside of trains are to be used only for emergencies or to give
information to waiting passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an immensely popular driver, and he's likely to accept
the consequences and we'll move on,'' Johnston said. ``Knowing this
driver, I think he'll do whatever he can not to offend those
residents again.''
</P>
<P>
   No other complaints were filed against Perdue. Several hundred
riders on the F-Line train signed a petition supporting him.
</P>
<P>
   But other residents along the line said they were pleased that
the singing has been silenced. One of them, Peter Groubert, drove a
city bus for 20 years before retiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was the only one that it disturbed until he
mentioned it,'' Groubert, 52, said in referring to the complainant.
``It's not that he's singing. It's just so darned loud. When he
turns the corner, it's like he's in the living room.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to whistle and sing so I can't put him down for it,''
Groubert said. ``But I kept it in the bus.''

   WASHINGTON _ Why was Japan's artillery much more accurate than
its rifle-fire in World War II? Why do Japanese athletes, unlike
those of most other countries, perform better in trials for their
national Olympic team than in the Olympics themselves?
</P>
<P>
   According to a prominent Japanese sociologist, the answer to
both questions is the same: Japanese people do better when they are
not being observed by foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   The artillery was far behind the front-lines, out of sight of
the enemy, and only Japanese spectators watch Olympic trials while
the whole world watches the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   The sociologist first expounded this theory in the 1970s, since
when Japan has gotten much more used to being watched by foreigners
_ especially where its economic performance is concerned. But many
Japanese manifestly feel uncomfortable under a foreign microscope.
</P>
<P>
   Since its economy began stagnating seven years ago, Japan has
endured a deluge of criticism and advice, mostly from the United
States. Recent weeks have brought more of the same, with senior
U.S. officials savaging Japanese trade policy and President Bill
Clinton delivering milder admonishments during his recent visit to
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Some leading Japanese commentators now say the country's poor
economic performance, and foreign disapproval of it, are bringing
deep feelings of insecurity to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   The country's reaction to foreign pressure is complex. Sometimes
Japanese officials welcome it as a way of persuading public opinion
to accept unpopular decisions; sometimes they resent it. Lately,
resentment has been growing.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly these cultural factors need to be taken into account by
foreigners seeking to influence Japanese decisions. Grating against
a culture is usually counterproductive (witness U.S. attempts to
browbeat France), and there is no point in gratuitously alienating
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, there are two sides to most issues. Clinton may have a
point when he warns that the soaring Japanese trade surplus could
provoke calls for ``retaliatory protectionism'' in the United
States. But it is part of his job, not just Japan's, to keep
American protectionism at bay.
</P>
<P>
   The United States may be right that Japan has not done enough to
help its neighbors since the Asian economic crisis erupted last
year. But it was Washington that torpedoed Japan's original plans
for a big new Asian fund to help countries in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo was wrong to block further trade liberalization at the
summit meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum this
month. But it is right to point out that fast-growing America will
inevitably suck in more imports than slow-growing Japan.
</P>
<P>
   America is perfectly entitled to ask whether the Japanese
system, so effective when Japan was catching up with the West, is
capable of dealing with current problems. But many Americans tend
to forget that Japan's values and priorities are legitimately
different from their own.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, the Japanese will have to get used to
foreign attention. In today's interdependent world, the trend is
for the international community to intervene ever more intrusively
into what used to be regarded as a country's domestic economic and
political affairs.
</P>
<P>
   There is also nothing in Japan remotely resembling the huge
American policy-formation machine, a nexus of public and private
interests of every hue, that is constantly throwing out new
economic plans and ideas.
</P>
<P>
   As the world's third-largest economy after the United States and
the European Union, Japan must accept that its domestic policies
are a legitimate subject for foreign analysis and recommendations,
especially when they are not succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that if the Japanese find that those
recommendations clash too sharply with their culture and their
values, they should come up with more effective policies of their
own. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ George Soros, the greatest speculator of the age,
admitted in a book published worldwide Sunday that putting his
funds' money into Russia was ``the worst investment of my
professional career'' and warned that the world is heading into a
depression unless international finance is reformed soon.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Crisis of Global Capitalism,'' Soros has put together
many of his observations of recent years in a book that amounts to
a wake-up call from a man who knows his subject firsthand.
</P>
<P>
   This year the value of the Soros funds dropped from about $22
billion to $18 billion _ half of the losses vanished in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   One section of the book consists of his diary of how he tried to
prevent the August financial meltdown in Moscow, an experience that
he concedes demonstrated to him the difficulty of reconciling his
role as an investor with his efforts to help make Russia a
democratic society.
</P>
<P>
   He seeks neither sympathy nor redress for his losses, only a new
and more stable order for global finance, despite the fact that
less volatility would mean fewer opportunities for speculators like
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to prevent the global capitalist system from destroying
itself,'' he writes. It is as if Joseph P. Kennedy had demanded
stock-market regulation during the Roaring Twenties _ or, if Soros
is right, just before the crash of 1929.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the book is devoted to an attack on what he calls the
dogma of ``market fundamentalism'' underlying the structure of the
global economy.
</P>
<P>
   At times he overstates the obvious, most notably in a lengthy
explanation of his favorite market theory of ``reflexivity,'' which
boils down to the observation that the thoughts and statements of
market players can affect the market.
</P>
<P>
   His definition of this unsurprising theory: ``Facts can be
influenced by making statements about them.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, when enough people chant the mantra of ``the magic
of the marketplace,'' Soros warns, this helps create the mass
delusion that the market solves all problems, whereupon people like
him bet that the herd will eventually stumble and he then picks up
the pieces.
</P>
<P>
   He explains how his theories have helped make this contrarian
rich, but lest he give away Soros Fund Management's crown jewels,
he cites few examples beyond his already well-documented
billion-dollar profit on the 1992 fall of the British pound.
</P>
<P>
   In the present crisis, he argues that more information for
lenders is not sufficient because markets are inherently unstable _
and ``how much instability can society take?''
</P>
<P>
   Soros proposes a carrot-and-stick combination that would help
guarantee loans to countries that disclose their full balance
sheets and penalize banks that ignored warning signs.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of having the International Monetary Fund serve as the
multinational banks' debt collector from devastated borrowers in
the developing world, the banks would have to swallow some of their
losses by turning bad debts into equity.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the IMF's lending capacity would be increased
by issuing Special Drawing Rights to fill the financial hole
created by a default. The Special Drawing Right, or SDR, is an
artificial IMF reserve currency that central banks can cash in for
dollars and other currencies.
</P>
<P>
   This complex plan would be institutionalized by an International
Credit Insurance Corporation with access to all information about
outstanding loans, public and private, carried by borrowers and
lenders alike.
</P>
<P>
   The corporation would then decide what proportion of a loan to
guarantee at preferential interest rates. Foreign banks and
bondholders would be at risk for the rest.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that lenders could no longer count on IMF bailouts,
Soros argues, would put a powerful tool in the hands of the IMF and
``avoid excesses in either direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The book's publishing history demonstrates the public lack of
urgency about the problem. Originally contracted to Random House
for an advance of $50,000, a draft of the book was delivered this
summer to the publisher, which had recently been bought by
Bertelsmann AG of Germany. Soros urged Random House to move up the
publishing date from early 1999 to the autumn of this year.
</P>
<P>
   After Random House refused, the author went to PublicAffairs, a
small, new, and aggressive house, which shipped copies to U.S.
bookstores within two months of receiving his manuscript on Sept.
22.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, PublicAffairs sold the international rights for
$900,000, splitting the money in the traditional ratio of 75-25
between author and publisher in a financial coup worthy of, well,
George Soros. &QL;

PROFESSOR FUDGE: CANDY EXPERT JAN SINGLETON SHARES HIS SWEET
SECRETS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KATHRYN HOPPER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAPEVINE, Texas _ Making great fudge is like dancing the tango.
</P>
<P>
   ``Timing is the key,'' says Jan Singleton, a dance instructor
turned carpenter turned fudgemaker extraordinaire. ``All the parts
have to fit together at the right moment, or it doesn't really
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Singleton is a Grapevine handyman known as Mr. Fixer, but in
Oklahoma City, he's better known as The Fudge Man. For 13 years, he
went door to door selling his fudge, which came in more than 20
flavors, from the bestselling chocolate pecan to the unusual lemon
cream.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is teaching his craft to fellow fudge fiends through the
Grapevine Parks &AMP; Recreation Department. Singleton teaches a
one-day seminar on the basics and a longer course that explores
exotic varieties, such as Kahlua Kiss.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he demonstrated his fudgemaking prowess at the
Grapevine Recreation Center. Anyone trying to work out on
treadmills or run laps around the track was forced to smell
Singleton's handiwork as he blended his way through several
batches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all how long you cook it, how long you beat it and when
you add the dry ingredients,'' he said before delving into the
finer points of fudgemaking.
</P>
<P>
   Like any master chef, he's a bit particular when it comes to the
ingredients. For example, he only uses Imperial and C&AMP;H sugars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cheaper stuff doesn't come out nearly as good,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He also insists on using real butter but says any brand will do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to think it would make a difference, but it doesn't,''
he says. ``A cow's a cow.''
</P>
<P>
   As for chocolate, he tells students to go with Guittard and
Baker's brands:
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the only ones that give you a rounded flavor and all
the rich nuances of the chocolate,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Once the proper ingredients are assembled, it's time to stir.
Singleton uses a long-handled, black wooden spoon to blend the
sugar, marshmallows and condensed milk in his basic fudge recipe.
His favorite spoon is worn down to a straight line on the tip after
stirring more than 1,200 batches.
</P>
<P>
   Singleton tells a bit of his life story as he stirs. The
60-year-old Oklahoma native probably wouldn't have ever gotten into
the fudge business if the oil bust hadn't hit so hard in the '80s.
When his carpentry jobs dried up, fudge got his family through the
tough times.
</P>
<P>
   He sold his fudge at craft shows and then door to door,
eventually building a clientele of more than 1,500 customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got used to seeing The Fudge Man coming around,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife moved to Grapevine about two years ago, and
people there are just now learning about his way with nuts and
chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have the equipment and space that I used to have, so
we're doing this on a much smaller scale,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He prepares for the key moment of fudgemaking: taking the melted
concoction off the burner at precisely the right time. Not doing
so, he warns, is the biggest mistake most people make.
</P>
<P>
   He can usually tell by sight and texture when its ready, but he
warns novices to use a candy thermometer, which should read 245
degrees Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't use one of those thermometers you buy at the grocery
store,'' he says. ``They're cheap and not really accurate. Get one
from a bakers' supply company or cake-decorating shop.''
</P>
<P>
   When the concoction is ready, it's time to blend it with the
chocolate in a mixer. Singleton uses two classic KitchenAid mixers
and tells students to forget their favorite hand-held ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be able to be at least 225 amps to handle it,'' he
says. ``Otherwise, it will burn out the motor as it starts to
set.''
</P>
<P>
   He mixes batches for at least 12 minutes. For a more exotic
variety, such as his Chocolate Silk, he pours in amaretto and turns
on the mixer for 30 seconds more.
</P>
<P>
   He then stirs in the remaining dry ingredients and spoons the
fudge into a greased baking pan. Singleton lets it set for at least
30 minutes, although he says that the time can vary, based on
humidity, altitude and even barometric pressure.
</P>
<P>
   When it's time to store the fudge, Singleton recommends using a
glass jar with a plastic top, which will preserve it _ in the
fridge _ for up to 6 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ages in the jar and actually gets even smoother,'' says his
wife, Marie Singleton.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, for all his work, Jan Singleton can't eat the fudge he
creates because he is diabetic. But he doesn't seem to mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the challenge of creating it,'' he says. ``It's fun for
me to see what I can come up with.''

FOR PURSUING THE TRIVIAL, CHOOSE YOUR PATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Quiz shows have been around at least since the days of radio and
were also a staple of early television programs. Even though the
shows were broadcast through a speaker, they were often interactive
for their listeners, who would play along and shout out the answers
to the trivia questions along with the on-air contestants.
</P>
<P>
   At least they did in my family, where the nightly half-hour of
``Jeopardy'' was considered educational television.
</P>
<P>
   Trivia-quiz games also proved popular at parties. The original
Trivial Pursuit was a hot seller in the early 1980s. People
gathered together for the challenge of hopping little pie pans
around the game-board wheel in search of intellectual dominance.
</P>
<P>
   Multiplayer quiz games for the personal computer seem like a
natural step. In that market niche, You Don't Know Jack, which
bills itself as ``the irreverent quiz show party game,'' has
dominated the market since its release in 1995, and for good
reason.
</P>
<P>
   The game is programmed to respond to each player's keyboard
input with a variety of jokes and insults; it truly lives up to the
billing of interactivity that CD-ROMs promise. The game pumps mass
quantities of energy, humor and attitude into the television
quiz-show format with clever questions that combine popular culture
with typical general-knowledge topics.
</P>
<P>
   (A sample question on the subject of ``baked goods and the
height-challenged'' reads: ``The Keebler elves are what? (a)
nomadic; (b) carnivorous; (c) migratory, or (d) arboreal?'') The
Quiz Kids have grown up into the MTV generation.
</P>
<P>
   Head Rush, a spinoff of You Don't Know Jack, loosely follows the
same formula but aims for slightly younger players. Jeopardy! and
Rocky &AMP; Bullwinkle's Know-It-All Quiz Show are bookends for the age
groups, with the former intended for adults and the latter meant
for children under 12.
</P>
<P>
   All the games reviewed here follow similar formats. They allow
one to three players to compete at the same time under names they
choose. Each player is assigned a specific key on the computer's
keyboard with which to ``buzz'' in ahead of the other players, and
a couple of the programs allow users to select an avatar, a
graphical character to represent the player on the computer's
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps as a nod to the impact of their broadcast forebears, all
the games here use the set of a television studio as a framing
device for the action.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of television, the Keebler elves are arboreal. In their
many commercials, they are shown living in trees. &QL;

   YOU DON'T KNOW JACK VOLUME 4, THE RIDE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Jellyvision and Berkeley Systems; $29.99; Windows 95 and 98,
Macintosh 7.1 and later.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Back with yet another edition, You Don't Know Jack comes
screeching onto your screen with 800 new questions, all with the
same tone of hip sarcasm that made the first three versions of the
game a hit.
</P>
<P>
   The Ride begins with an on-screen elevator descent. While the
floors pass by through the elevator's windows, an unseen guide goes
over the rules of the game and guides players through the setup.
</P>
<P>
   If your mind wanders and the game senses no keyboard response
when it asks you to type in your name in preparation for play, it
speaks right up with a sneer: ``Come on, this isn't television. You
have to (italics)work.''(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   True to the television-style format, the game presents a wide
range of fake commercials and sponsors of imaginary products like
E.coli Diet Shakes. The background music veers from thunderous rock
to pure game-show cheese, and most of the hosts deliver the
questions in a smart-alecky manner reminiscent of the old Dennis
Miller ``Weekend Update'' segments on ``Saturday Night Live.'' But
it all fits with the hyperactive tone of the game.
</P>
<P>
   With spinning visuals and a steady backbeat of noise, trivia
questions are hurled toward players at a frenetic pace and in
varying formats. The Ride contains several minisections devoted to
word associations, including one called Road Kill in which terms
related to a clue float on the screen, daring you to buzz in on the
correct answer as a yellow line on a dark highway speeds by in the
background.
</P>
<P>
   The You Don't Know Jack game series has been quite successful
because of its take-no-prisoners attitude, bawdy humor and dazzling
graphics, and Volume 4 continues in that vein. The program itself
is quite huge, though, and users need a computer with at least 180
megabytes of free hard-disk space to install it.
</P>
<P>
   An online version of the game can be found at www.bezerk.com.
Jack has earned its reputation as a party animal, and between gags
about bodily functions, double-entendres and bad puns, the game
even manages to impart some wisdom. &QL;

   This ... is ... Jeopardy!''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most popular and cerebral game shows on the air is
now on a CD-ROM, complete with the familiar big blue board of
categories and the television host, Alex Trebek, doing the
voice-over as the moderator and appearing in digitized form.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeopardy,'' which ran on NBC from 1964 to 1975 and has had
fresh episodes in syndication since 1984, has a unique format in
which players have to respond to an answer by providing the right
question.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ George Soros, the greatest speculator of the age,
admitted in a book published worldwide Sunday that putting his
funds' money into Russia was ``the worst investment of my
professional career'' and warned that the world is heading into a
depression unless international finance is reformed soon.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Crisis of Global Capitalism,'' Soros has put together
many of his observations of recent years in a book that amounts to
a wake-up call from a man who knows his subject firsthand.
</P>
<P>
   This year the value of the Soros funds dropped from about $22
billion to $18 billion _ half of the losses vanished in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   One section of the book consists of his diary of how he tried to
prevent the August financial meltdown in Moscow, an experience that
he concedes demonstrated to him the difficulty of reconciling his
role as an investor with his efforts to help make Russia a
democratic society.
</P>
<P>
   He seeks neither sympathy nor redress for his losses, only a new
and more stable order for global finance, despite the fact that
less volatility would mean fewer opportunities for speculators like
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to prevent the global capitalist system from destroying
itself,'' he writes. It is as if Joseph P. Kennedy had demanded
stock-market regulation during the Roaring Twenties _ or, if Soros
is right, just before the crash of 1929.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the book is devoted to an attack on what he calls the
dogma of ``market fundamentalism'' underlying the structure of the
global economy.
</P>
<P>
   At times he overstates the obvious, most notably in a lengthy
explanation of his favorite market theory of ``reflexivity,'' which
boils down to the observation that the thoughts and statements of
market players can affect the market.
</P>
<P>
   His definition of this unsurprising theory: ``Facts can be
influenced by making statements about them.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, when enough people chant the mantra of ``the magic
of the marketplace,'' Soros warns, this helps create the mass
delusion that the market solves all problems, whereupon people like
him bet that the herd will eventually stumble and he then picks up
the pieces.
</P>
<P>
   He explains how his theories have helped make this contrarian
rich, but lest he give away Soros Fund Management's crown jewels,
he cites few examples beyond his already well-documented
billion-dollar profit on the 1992 fall of the British pound.
</P>
<P>
   In the present crisis, he argues that more information for
lenders is not sufficient because markets are inherently unstable _
and ``how much instability can society take?''
</P>
<P>
   Soros proposes a carrot-and-stick combination that would help
guarantee loans to countries that disclose their full balance
sheets and penalize banks that ignored warning signs.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of having the International Monetary Fund serve as the
multinational banks' debt collector from devastated borrowers in
the developing world, the banks would have to swallow some of their
losses by turning bad debts into equity.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the IMF's lending capacity would be increased
by issuing Special Drawing Rights to fill the financial hole
created by a default. The Special Drawing Right, or SDR, is an
artificial IMF reserve currency that central banks can cash in for
dollars and other currencies.
</P>
<P>
   This complex plan would be institutionalized by an International
Credit Insurance Corporation with access to all information about
outstanding loans, public and private, carried by borrowers and
lenders alike.
</P>
<P>
   The corporation would then decide what proportion of a loan to
guarantee at preferential interest rates. Foreign banks and
bondholders would be at risk for the rest.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that lenders could no longer count on IMF bailouts,
Soros argues, would put a powerful tool in the hands of the IMF and
``avoid excesses in either direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The book's publishing history demonstrates the public lack of
urgency about the problem. Originally contracted to Random House
for an advance of $50,000, a draft of the book was delivered this
summer to the publisher, which had recently been bought by
Bertelsmann AG of Germany. Soros urged Random House to move up the
publishing date from early 1999 to the autumn of this year.
</P>
<P>
   After Random House refused, the author went to PublicAffairs, a
small, new, and aggressive house, which shipped copies to U.S.
bookstores within two months of receiving his manuscript on Sept.
22.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, PublicAffairs sold the international rights for
$900,000, splitting the money in the traditional ratio of 75-25
between author and publisher in a financial coup worthy of, well,
George Soros. &QL;

 UNDATED: right question.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The computerized version of the game transfers the format, as
well as the look of the ``Jeopardy'' television studio, to the
desktop. Three players compete in each match, although if you're
short on players, the game will provide electronic ones.
</P>
<P>
   When buzzing in, human players type in their responses on the
keyboard (although the program will provide the ``who is ...'' or
``what is ...'' half of the question for you) while the
cybercontestants get away with answering out loud.
</P>
<P>
   Users can choose three levels of play: normal, tournament and
speed match. In the normal game, which resembles the television
version, subject categories are paraded out and attached to the big
board along with rows of monetary figures.
</P>
<P>
   To choose a category and a dollar amount, click on the
appropriate square. The clue is read, and players can buzz in as
soon as the ``lockout'' lights come on. The lockout lights prevent
the human players from excitedly buzzing in while the clue is being
presented.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeopardy'' in any form has never pandered to the intelligence
(or lack thereof) of its audience. The game's subjects range from
the choreographer Twyla Tharp to obscure geography tidbits to the
reigns of foreign dictators. ``Yessss!'' Trebek often says when a
player comes up with the proper answer.
</P>
<P>
   The interface is fairly basic. To break up the monotony of
looking at the blue squares for the whole game, different views of
the virtual studio are displayed on the screen. The game will not
amuse you with inventive animations or witty repartee being mumbled
in the background; it is designed as a serious, stately game for
intelligent trivia buffs _ without the parting gifts for
contestants. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HEAD RUSH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Jellyvision and Berkeley Systems; $29.95; for Windows 95 and
98, and Macintosh 7.1 and later.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The box copy for Head Rush says: ``This product contains
immature content, loud body noises, a smattering of mildly saucy
language and references to music, TV shows and movies that will
definitely not be suitable for most geezers. Besides, they won't
get it anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Who says there isn't truth in advertising these days?
</P>
<P>
   Aimed squarely at teen-agers, Head Rush is a junior version of
the hugely popular You Don't Know Jack, but it doesn't skimp on
features.
</P>
<P>
   The game format follows that of its older sibling: players pick
an avatar and a name, and they try to beat one another at pressing
their assigned keys on the keyboard in response to questions, then
select one of four multiple-choice answers.
</P>
<P>
   Players rack up large totals of imaginary money for nailing the
right answers to questions, but a wrong answer will result in
having your avatar disintegrate before your eyes, only to bounce
back for the next round.
</P>
<P>
   With thumping background music, slick animation, quick keyboard
responses and an unseen announcer moving things along between
questions, Head Rush manages to wrangle such unusual suspects as
Arnold Schwarzenegger, the bubble-gum pop group Hanson and
television's ``X-Files'' into questions that are actually about
classical music, grammar and history.
</P>
<P>
   The game allows a maneuver called Bite Your Neighbor, complete
with chomping little teeth, in which a player can jump in with the
answer if the first player who buzzed in stalls.
</P>
<P>
   As in You Don't Know Jack, there is also a section called Dis or
Dat that asks players to decide if a term flashed on the screen
falls into one of two categories. (``Famous Artist or Foreign Car _
Audi? El Greco? Alfa Romeo?'').
</P>
<P>
   Head Rush keeps up its level of prickly personalized attention
to the player at all times. ``Not bad, you only missed one!'' the
announcer will sometimes scoff after a round.
</P>
<P>
   Hyperactive as it is, Head Rush is also infectious, as long as
you do not tend to get easily upset or disgusted in the pursuit of
knowledge. It's like the high-school quiz bowl with humor about
embarrassing body functions thrown in. The game is loud, rude and
crude _ and teen-agers will probably love it. &QL;

   ROCKY &AMP; BULLWINKLE'S KNOW-IT-ALL QUIZ GAME &QL;

<P>
   (Houghton Mifflin Interactive; $19.95; Windows 95 and 98, and
Macintosh 7.1 and later.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For young trivia fans not quite old enough to handle You Don't
Know Jack or Jeopardy but who still want to play, Rocky &AMP;
Bullwinkle's Know-It-All Quiz Game might be a good choice. The
original Jay Ward cartoon television shows starring Rocket J.
Squirrel and Bullwinkle J. Moose ran from 1959 to 1973 and have
been in perpetual reruns ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The Know-It-All Quiz Game transfers much of the look, sly humor
and insider asides from the show to the CD-ROM. (``What's an
avatar?'' the moose asks as the program prepares the players for
action. ``Bullwinkle!'' the squirrel scolds. ``Didn't you pay
attention at the production meeting?'')
</P>
<P>
   The game takes its time, and several screens, setting up the
action. Players select the level of questioning (Easy or Hard),
pick avatars to represent themselves, then choose virtual teammates
from the Bullwinkle stable, including Peabody the talking dog,
Dudley Do-Right and, of course, the consummate foes Boris and
Natasha.
</P>
<P>
   Intended for players age 9 to 12, the program is designed as a
straightforward quiz show with three rounds of play. The first two
rounds consist of multiple-choice questions, and the third is a
true-false test. In the first round, players are with their
selected team members, who comment on the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we have the superior team,'' Peabody proclaims every
so often after a correct answer. Most of the questions seem on
target for the preteen-age audience the game is aimed at; they
range from stumpers about the book ``Johnny Tremain'' and basic
history and science trivia.
</P>
<P>
   The animation in the program is simple and somewhat jerky, much
like the animation in the television show, and the pace of play is
not particularly fast.
</P>
<P>
   The game does not dump hundreds of megabytes onto your hard
drive, however, and the system requirements are fairly low, so you
do not have to have the latest and greatest hardware for your kids
to see Boris and Natasha plotting (italics)beeg(end italics)
trouble for moose and squirrel.

billion-dollar profit on the 1992 fall of the British pound.
</P>
<P>
   In the present crisis, he argues that more information for
lenders is not sufficient because markets are inherently unstable _
and ``how much instability can society take?''
</P>
<P>
   Soros proposes a carrot-and-stick combination that would help
guarantee loans to countries that disclose their full balance
sheets and penalize banks that ignored warning signs.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of having the International Monetary Fund serve as the
multinational banks' debt collector from devastated borrowers in
the developing world, the banks would have to swallow some of their
losses by turning bad debts into equity.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the IMF's lending capacity would be increased
by issuing Special Drawing Rights to fill the financial hole
created by a default. The Special Drawing Right, or SDR, is an
artificial IMF reserve currency that central banks can cash in for
dollars and other currencies.
</P>
<P>
   This complex plan would be institutionalized by an International
Credit Insurance Corporation with access to all information about
outstanding loans, public and private, carried by borrowers and
lenders alike.
</P>
<P>
   The corporation would then decide what proportion of a loan to
guarantee at preferential interest rates. Foreign banks and
bondholders would be at risk for the rest.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that lenders could no longer count on IMF bailouts,
Soros argues, would put a powerful tool in the hands of the IMF and
``avoid excesses in either direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The book's publishing history demonstrates the public lack of
urgency about the problem. Originally contracted to Random House
for an advance of $50,000, a draft of the book was delivered this
summer to the publisher, which had recently been bought by
Bertelsmann AG of Germany. Soros urged Random House to move up the
publishing date from early 1999 to the autumn of this year.
</P>
<P>
   After Random House refused, the author went to PublicAffairs, a
small, new, and aggressive house, which shipped copies to U.S.
bookstores within two months of receiving his manuscript on Sept.
22.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, PublicAffairs sold the international rights for
$900,000, splitting the money in the traditional ratio of 75-25
between author and publisher in a financial coup worthy of, well,
George Soros. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   They are, rest assured, the only Microsoft products to be tested
for excessive hugging. Arthur and DW look for all the world like
simple stuffed toys based on the aardvarks from PBS's most popular
children's show, ``Arthur.''
</P>
<P>
   But these two 21-inch figures, called Actimates, are not toys:
they are furry computer peripherals. Both Arthur and DW have
roughly 700 internal parts _ including 512 kilobytes of computer
memory _ to natter and sing away with a vocabulary of roughly 4,000
words.
</P>
<P>
   It's only when you squeeze one of the creature's extremities
that it reveals its true nature. ``Do you know what's gross?''
Arthur asks when you squeeze his hand and then his ear in a weird
impression of a Masonic handshake. ``Green goop that drips from
faucets. That's gross.'' DW, in return for a handshake, will recite
the date and time.
</P>
<P>
   The tricks, however, don't end there. Sit an Actimate in front
of a computer running an Arthur CD-ROM (made by Microsoft; $35) or
the PBS Arthur Web site (underwritten by Microsoft) and the doll
will help the child solve on-screen puzzles and games. Put the doll
in front of a television set showing ``Arthur'' programs or
Microsoft-adapted videotapes of the show (about $15) and the dolls
will talk back to the television. ``That's got to hurt!'' the
Arthur doll groans when the on-screen Arthur takes a tumble.
</P>
<P>
   If this all sounds too much like one of those horror movies
where dolls spring to life, be warned: Arthur and DW are not alone.
This fall has seen the release of a menagerie of fuzzy computers.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel has introduced My Interactive Pooh, a $100
Winnie-the-Pooh doll that can download 20 minutes of chat or songs
from a CD-ROM into its memory, call a child by name and interact
with a computer through a cable link. Two other, less expensive
creatures _ Furby from Tiger Electronics and Real Live Babe, a toy
pig from Equity Toys based on the movie character _ have
sophisticated electronic innards that allow some interactivity
(although neither have computer or television interfaces). And this
month Microsoft announced four new Actimates that will be based on
the BBC-produced ``Teletubbies.''
</P>
<P>
   All of these dolls offer varying levels of interactivity and
differing claims about educational value. Microsoft, which financed
sophisticated psychological testing during the Actimates'
development, does not even use the word toy to describe its dolls.
</P>
<P>
   They are, Microsoft press releases say, nothing less than
``learning systems.'' But the educational value of these kinds of
interactive toys is a matter of keen debate among child-development
experts. Should parents buy a fuzzy chip-enhanced doll in the hope
that it will help a child learn?
</P>
<P>
   ``People think these kinds of things are going to get their kids
to be Harvard grads,'' said Mariann Szymanski, president of the Toy
Tips Research Center at Marquette University. ``They're not.''
</P>
<P>
   Claire Lerner, a child development specialist at Zero to Three,
a Washington-based nonprofit organization, also worries that
parental anxiety alone drives these purchases. ``Parents are very
overwhelmed right now with an explosion of research on how they can
help their children's' development,'' she said. ``There's a real
danger in promoting these toys that way.''
</P>
<P>
   There have also been positive reviews. Microsoft has received
high marks for its first Actimate, an interactive version of
Barney, the purple dinosaur. The dolls certainly seem educational.
Among other things, they try to get children to say the alphabet
backwards, pick out rhyming words and play simple memory games.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the dolls often seem almost oppressively instructive.
Arthur, for example, can be programmed to act as a singing alarm
clock. A child expecting a cheerful ``What do you want for
breakfast?'' after waking is more likely to hear, ``Today is the
Hindu festival of light. To find out more, go to your local
library.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Erik Strommen, a developmental child psychologist who had
been trying to find ways to make computers more accessible to small
children, was working at the Children's Television Workshop, the
home of ``Sesame Street,'' when Microsoft approached him about
working on Barney in 1996. ``I gasped when I first saw it,''
Strommen said of an early prototype. ``I hadn't thought along these
lines. My initial reaction was, This jumps the fence.''
</P>
<P>
   Strommen's job, as the project's research and design consultant,
was to figure out how to make the gadget an effective learning toy,
a task that would ultimately involve upward of 25 formal
psychological test programs studying 500 children and a variety of
more casual assessments at day-care centers near Microsoft's
headquarters in Redmond, Wash. The goal, Strommen said, was that
Barney should give children ``a sense of mastery.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the first test versions of Barney undermined that
goal. Because the device was capable of doing so many things _ and
because it insisted on doing so many things _ it was perceived by
many children as a fuzzy tyrant. ``He was browbeating,'' Strommen
said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Microsoft concluded, was that Barney had been
programmed like a piece of software _ unfriendly, unyielding and
full of tasks to complete _ instead of like a toy. The company had
assumed that kids would play along with Barney, while the kids
expected that the (italics)doll(end italics) would play around with
them. To tone Barney down, subsequent versions replaced some of the
orders with praise and idle pseudoconversation.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the lessons Strommenn learned from Barney, which is
aimed at children as young as 2, didn't completely transfer to
Arthur and DW, which are intended for ages 4 to 8. To reflect their
older audience, the Arthur and DW dolls deal with more complicated
learning material like basic arithmetic, telling time and the
alphabet. To that end, they have double the computer memory and
roughly twice the vocabulary of Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Remembering the tyrannical Barney, Strommen thought it might be
useful to further humanize Arthur and DW by allowing them to make
preprogrammed mistakes when participating in, say, an arithmetic
exercise while the child is using a computer. The scheme, however,
made children furious.
</P>
<P>
   It showed, Strommen said, that no matter how much they appeared
to be treating the toys like human playmates, the children had very
different expectations for the devices. ``Children are more
sophisticated than we give them credit for,'' he said. ``They
always know damn well that this is not a person.
</P>
<P>
   All the Actimates behave in three distinct ways. When used with
the PC or television connections, the toys' programming emphasizes
what psychologists call scaffolding, that is, providing temporary
forms of assistance. For example, if a child has trouble picking
out ryhming sounds in a word game, the Arthur and DW dolls gently
offer the correct answer.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Older human playmates and parents do much the same thing when
they help children count by, say, filling in missing numbers.
</P>
<P>
   When an Actimate comes under the control of a PC, however, it
keeps scaffolding but encourages the child to play only with the
on-screen image of the character that appears on the CD-ROM or Web
site. The dolls receive their instructions through a hamburger-size
radio transmitter ($55) that plugs into a standard MIDI port (on a
machine running Microsoft Windows) to form a wireless link between
the fuzzy creatures and PCs.
</P>
<P>
   There is a second radio transmitter (for another $55) that plugs
into any standard VCR. That transmitter literally puts words in the
dolls' mouths, the words having been sent as data through the
television signal.
</P>
<P>
   When in couch-potato mode, the Actimate tries to focus the
child's attention on the tube. If the child squeezes the doll while
the TV is on, the doll will offer such peevish remarks as ``Are you
trying to get my attention?''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a toy's encouraging children to watch TV might
appall many parents, but Strommen said that viewing in the company
of a parent or older child helps younger children learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Research tells us that you're sitting there watching TV,'' he
said. ``And research also shows your parents are not with you,'' he
said. The Actimate is programmed to act like a surrogate parent.
</P>
<P>
   That is the kind of help that Marla Smith needed. A shift worker
and single mother in Decatur, Ill., Ms Smith doesn't always have
the time she would like to help her 5-year-old son, Travis, learn.
</P>
<P>
   She bought a PC three years ago but struggled to find software
appropriate for young children. Last year, she ordered a Barney
doll with computer interface and CD-ROM after seeing them
advertised on a home shopping channel. ``It was expensive but I
figure it was worth it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For Travis, the chip-laden Barney fulfilled an important
traditional stuffed-doll role. Last May, after he broke his arm
after a failed attempt to emulate Superman, Travis insisted on
bringing his Barney to the hospital emergency room for comfort. The
robo-Barney had also become part of his daily computer sessions.
Ms. Smith said her son has learned to identify color, basic shapes,
several songs and how to operate the computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to his teachers, he is ahead of all the other kids
in his class,'' she said, attributing a large part of that success
to the doll. ``If only they had them when I was a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts in child development disagreed with that kind of
assessment. Ms. Szymanski said that figures based on well-known
characters are useful at helping children with ``character
development roles,'' but cautioned that parents should not believe
that by buying these toys, ``they're going to make their kids
smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lerner suggested that simpler, time-proven toys can often be
more effective at preparing young children for computers (to say
nothing about life) by developing logical thinking and motor
skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at a shape sorter and think that I'd rather my child
use that,'' Ms. Lerner said. ``With a shape sorter, a child is much
more an active agent than they tend to be with highly titillating
toys that do so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchel Resnick, head of the learning research group at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Lab, agreed that some
of the ``richest learning experiences'' are provided by simpler
toys like old-fashioned building blocks that allow children to act
as designers or creators. ``Just because something is complicated
or electronic doesn't mean it's useful,'' he said. ``What's more
important is the nature of the interaction the toy supports.
Sophisticated toys can lead to different types of interactions,
some better and some worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Strommen at Microsoft readily acknowledged the value of
traditional toys. ``What we can do with technology a person can do
infinitely more powerfully,'' he said. But whether or not Microsoft
becomes a giant in the stuffed-toy business, the distinction
between traditional toys and the new microchip-driven toys is
likely to blur. Resnick emphasized that parents must now focus on
what the toy does instead of what it contains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asking today about electronics in toys is as if you said in
the 50s, `Do you think toys made of plastic are going to be
dominant in the future?' When you go to Toys `R' Us today, there is
not a plastic toys category.''

   Given that Marc Brown, a children's author, doesn't use a
computer and just upgraded from rotary-dial phones, it is not
surprising he wasn't all that impressed when Microsoft came calling
in early 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft wanted to transform his two anthropomorphized aardvark
siblings, Arthur and DW, into microchip-laden plush dolls that
could interact with computers and television sets.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown was reluctant after seeing Microsoft's first effort at
toy making, a computer-friendly version of Barney. ``It's a little
bit like flying a Lear jet down to your mailbox to pick up your
mail,'' he said. ``It wasn't really necessary to have an
animatronic doll to learn your colors.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown had previously turned down requests to turn the Arthur
stories into an animated series. ``I just knew what would happen to
Arthur,'' he said. ``In no time, they'd have him carry a weapon in
his backpack.''
</P>
<P>
   He finally agreed to a television series in 1994 after receiving
a proposal from WBGH, the public broadcasting station in Boston,
and Cinar Films of Montreal. ``Arthur'' began in 1996 and is now
the No. 1 show among 2- to 5-year-olds nationally.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also forced Brown to be more open to licensing his
characters, because much of program's funding comes from payments
for those rights. Eventually, he gave in to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw the very first prototypes, it was scary,'' Brown
recalled. ``It didn't resemble him at all.'' After some design
changes, Brown was generally satisfied. But his foray into the
world of computers hasn't changed his mind about technology.
``Using electric light is a big excitement for us,'' Brown said
from his studio in Hingham, Mass.

<P>
   NAPA, CALIF. _ Gunfire is not a sound commonly associated with
the Napa Valley, California's celebrated wine-making area tucked
away in the hills north of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least it wasn't until an eruption of armed violence over
the past two weeks, in which nine teenagers have been treated for
gunshot wounds and the city of Napa has become America's latest,
and least likely, capital of crime.
</P>
<P>
   After months of simmering tensions, rival gangs of Latino
teenagers staged a bloody shoot-out in a run-down corner of the
city at the beginning of last week. Two days later, a gunman from
one of the gangs sought revenge by opening fire with a 22-caliber
automatic pistol on a line of high school students waiting for
their morning bus.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did he hit his intended target, the 14-year-old brother
of one of the participants in the earlier fight, he also injured
two other teenagers standing next to him. The rest of the bus queue
fled in terror.
</P>
<P>
   This was not the first outbreak of armed violence in Napa _
there have been sporadic incidents for a few months _ but it marked
a sharp escalation in the increasingly bitter feuds pitting
disenfranchised Latino teenagers against each other in one of the
most affluent corners of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, it was the first time that bystanders had got caught
up in the violence. And it has set Napa thinking that it might be
on the verge of an all-out gang war.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot is in jeopardy here, because of the wineries and the
tourist industry. They are going to have to find a solution to this
because if it runs out of control it will be a big, big problem,''
warned Gilbert Lopez, a former a gang member turned Pentecostal
minister who works the streets up and down the valley.
</P>
<P>
   City authorities have been extraordinarily cautious in their
comments, clearly terrified of the impact that any further violence
might have on the livelihood of the area.
</P>
<P>
   The police insist Napa is still a safe place to visit, and the
tourist office insists it has received no panic calls or booking
cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   But for leaders of the Latino community, which does almost all
the menial work in the wine industry as well as the hotel and
restaurant trades but receives little if any recognition, it is
clear a crisis point has been reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel a great rage about what is going on, because they
feel they are essentially in an apartheid situation,'' said
Guillermo Brito, who runs a social services center called Nuestra
Esperanza. ``If the system keeps people down instead of helping
them to empower themselves, it is a recipe for major conflict down
the line.''
</P>
<P>
   The scourge of gang violence has hit Napa in much the same way
that it has spread throughout California. Turf wars in Los Angeles
in the late 1970s and early 1980s led families to send children
susceptible to gang influence out of town, thus contributing
unwittingly to the dissemination of the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   In state prisons, Mexicans then divided themselves into two
clans, the Nortenos and the Surenos _ northerners and southerners.
Partly this was a matter of where they had settled in California,
the city of Bakersfield being the rough dividing line.
</P>
<P>
   Partly it was a matter of integration. Second- or
third-generation Latinos formed friendships with white Americans,
creating the Norteno gang together, and learned to look down on
Sureno newcomers, whom they call ``scraps'' or ``corns.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Napa Valley, the two gangs do not fight so much over
territory or criminal rackets (although there are drugs around,
particularly methamphetamines known locally as ``crank``) as over
issues of identity.
</P>
<P>
   The Nortenos wear red, the Surenos blue, and they clash all
along the Napa River valley, from the city of Napa itself _ just
off the main tourist trail _ to the pretty town of Calistoga,
famous for its mud baths as well as its wine.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly the violence has taken the form of beatings, clubbings or
the occasional knife attack. Six months ago, though, Napa
experienced its first drive-by shooting, resulting in the death of
a 17-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   In Westwood, the Napa city neighborhood where the latest
violence has occurred, the situation is particularly explosive
because Nortenos and Surenos live on the same street blocks.
</P>
<P>
   For many Latinos in the Napa Valley, the gang violence is a
symptom of desperation experienced by young people with little to
fill their time and little to look forward to except a sense of
alienation from mainstream American society.
</P>
<P>
   There are few role models for them to look up to other than the
``cool'' gang leaders on the street. Only a tiny fraction of the
valley's schoolteachers and policemen speak Spanish, and fewer
still show much cultural understanding of their situation.
</P>
<P>
   The valley's main economic and political interest groups have
pressed for an end to the bad publicity before it damages the wine
and tourist industries and they have urged the police to catch the
culprits. One of two guns used in the recent shootings has now been
found, and an unnamed 17-year-old arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Such limited actions do not address the broader issues at stake
for the Latinos _ adequate wages, education and health care,
primarily _ and do little to bridge the gap between the two
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Latinos already make up 80 percent of the valley's population,
and the proportion is growing. More than a quarter of pupils
registering at public schools are new arrivals fresh from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``California is in for a rude awakening,'' Brito said. ``It
depends on Mexicans for labor but offers them little or nothing in
return. The gangs are only one piece of a much larger problem.'' &QL;

</P>
<P>
   This was not the first outbreak of armed violence in Napa _
there have been sporadic incidents for a few months _ but it marked
a sharp escalation in the increasingly bitter feuds pitting
disenfranchised Latino teenagers against each other in one of the
most affluent corners of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, it was the first time that bystanders had got caught
up in the violence. And it has set Napa thinking that it might be
on the verge of an all-out gang war.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot is in jeopardy here, because of the wineries and the
tourist industry. They are going to have to find a solution to this
because if it runs out of control it will be a big, big problem,''
warned Gilbert Lopez, a former a gang member turned Pentecostal
minister who works the streets up and down the valley.
</P>
<P>
   City authorities have been extraordinarily cautious in their
comments, clearly terrified of the impact that any further violence
might have on the livelihood of the area.
</P>
<P>
   The police insist Napa is still a safe place to visit, and the
tourist office insists it has received no panic calls or booking
cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   But for leaders of the Latino community, which does almost all
the menial work in the wine industry as well as the hotel and
restaurant trades but receives little if any recognition, it is
clear a crisis point has been reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel a great rage about what is going on, because they
feel they are essentially in an apartheid situation,'' said
Guillermo Brito, who runs a social services center called Nuestra
Esperanza. ``If the system keeps people down instead of helping
them to empower themselves, it is a recipe for major conflict down
the line.''
</P>
<P>
   The scourge of gang violence has hit Napa in much the same way
that it has spread throughout California. Turf wars in Los Angeles
in the late 1970s and early 1980s led families to send children
susceptible to gang influence out of town, thus contributing
unwittingly to the dissemination of the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   In state prisons, Mexicans then divided themselves into two
clans, the Nortenos and the Surenos _ northerners and southerners.
Partly this was a matter of where they had settled in California,
the city of Bakersfield being the rough dividing line.
</P>
<P>
   Partly it was a matter of integration. Second- or
third-generation Latinos formed friendships with white Americans,
creating the Norteno gang together, and learned to look down on
Sureno newcomers, whom they call ``scraps'' or ``corns.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Napa Valley, the two gangs do not fight so much over
territory or criminal rackets (although there are drugs around,
particularly methamphetamines known locally as ``crank``) as over
issues of identity.
</P>
<P>
   The Nortenos wear red, the Surenos blue, and they clash all
along the Napa River valley, from the city of Napa itself _ just
off the main tourist trail _ to the pretty town of Calistoga,
famous for its mud baths as well as its wine.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly the violence has taken the form of beatings, clubbings or
the occasional knife attack. Six months ago, though, Napa
experienced its first drive-by shooting, resulting in the death of
a 17-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   In Westwood, the Napa city neighborhood where the latest
violence has occurred, the situation is particularly explosive
because Nortenos and Surenos live on the same street blocks.
</P>
<P>
   For many Latinos in the Napa Valley, the gang violence is a
symptom of desperation experienced by young people with little to
fill their time and little to look forward to except a sense of
alienation from mainstream American society.
</P>
<P>
   There are few role models for them to look up to other than the
``cool'' gang leaders on the street. Only a tiny fraction of the
valley's schoolteachers and policemen speak Spanish, and fewer
still show much cultural understanding of their situation.
</P>
<P>
   The valley's main economic and political interest groups have
pressed for an end to the bad publicity before it damages the wine
and tourist industries and they have urged the police to catch the
culprits. One of two guns used in the recent shootings has now been
found, and an unnamed 17-year-old arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Such limited actions do not address the broader issues at stake
for the Latinos _ adequate wages, education and health care,
primarily _ and do little to bridge the gap between the two
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Latinos already make up 80 percent of the valley's population,
and the proportion is growing. More than a quarter of pupils
registering at public schools are new arrivals fresh from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``California is in for a rude awakening,'' Brito said. ``It
depends on Mexicans for labor but offers them little or nothing in
return. The gangs are only one piece of a much larger problem.'' &QL;

<P>
   BRUSSELS _ Christmas will come early this year for Carlos Prade.
In a few week's time Rotterdam's newest residential home for
retired people will be ready and Carlos will be moving in.
</P>
<P>
   Peering through a pair of funky blue-tinted glasses Carlos
admits he is weary now. He wants to take it easy, let someone else
take the strain.
</P>
<P>
   Although a fresh-faced 59, he suffers from aches and pains, his
hands are shaking and he speaks in a whisper. His grip on reality
appears tenuous. He shuffles off in mid-conversation and then
suddenly says: ``I want to go to England. To see Elizabeth.'' Then
he breaks into a song.
</P>
<P>
   In the home, a converted townhouse, Carlos will have his own
room and bathroom. There will be television, a communal kitchen for
anyone capable of cooking. Round-the-clock medical care is
guaranteed as well as trained staff to look after his
``psycho-social needs.''
</P>
<P>
   There won't be any official supply of dope heroin or cocaine.
But Carlos has no worries on that score. He is about to become the
first resident of the world's first old folks' home for drug
addicts.
</P>
<P>
   Holland has the healthiest drug addicts in the world. So healthy
that they are turning into pensioners and the authorities have a
geriatric drug policy dilemma on their hands.
</P>
<P>
   The average age of Dutch drug users has risen to 36, the highest
in the world, and thanks to a policy based on health rather than
criminalization that is increasing by 10 months each year. In
Rotterdam alone at least 100 drug addicts have made it to the 55-
to 70-year-old bracket.
</P>
<P>
   But substance abuse takes its toll, and although they are living
longer, aging Dutch junkies are old before their time.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 55 or 60 they are displaying symptoms of people 20 years
older. Senility is common. They forget things and feel
threatened,'' explains Harry Kuiper of the Boumanhuis Foundation,
one of the biggest Dutch drug addiction agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Most old people fret about keeping warm and getting to the shops
and the pension office. But Holland's geriatric junkies have the
added stress of having to hold their own on the drugs scene which
even in an ultra-tolerant society, where consumption is not
prosecuted, is run by criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Procuring narcotics, knowing when you are being fobbed off with
inferior stuff and finding enough money to keep the dealers happy
is not that easy when you have difficulty walking unaided.
</P>
<P>
   Now in response to a novel proposal from the Rotterdam
Junkiebond, the drug addicts union, the municipal health authority
has agreed to finance an old folks' home, devoted exclusively to
drug users, on a one-year pilot scheme basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a totally new development not just for the
Netherlands and Europe, but for the world,'' says Kuiper a keen
supporter of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   It is not on he says, to integrate the OAP junkies with ordinary
senior citizens because they might have difficulty finding
acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most elderly people would tolerate a person taking a drink or
smoking a cigarette, but just one gram of heroin in an old peoples'
home and they would want you out.''
</P>
<P>
   Nora Storm whose idea it was, has already given the residence a
name. ``Coconuts. One of the old men chose it,'' she says. ``He's
on coke and he's nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   A formidable woman in her fifties, Nora is the Junkiebond
president and has turned her own home into a dwelling for junkies
of all ages. She runs a tight ship. Drugs are allowed in the rooms
but you must show you are making an effort to limit consumption and
you must find a job and pay your way.
</P>
<P>
   The inauguration of Coconuts means she can at last stop worrying
about the granddaddies as she calls them. ``They can't cope. Their
brains are going and they leave on the gas sometimes. And they are
lonely. The music is not the same these days. They also have the
problem that their grandchildren won't visit them.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially the plan is to restrict the home to seven residents.
Out of their pensions they will pay a monthly rent. There will be
no pressure to kick the habit.
</P>
<P>
   So where will the drugs come from? ``It won't be a problem,'' is
all Nora will say. She foresees a growing demand for such
residences and insists that it should be up to the national health
service to take over the cost and running of them.
</P>
<P>
   Kuiper agrees. ``This is not an indulgence or an amusement,'' he
says. ``These people need special care.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 800. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   The broad-minded Dutch approach to drug use is legendary but a
national old junkies' home plan may be a bridge too far.
Rotterdam's health authority is pioneering a controversial scheme
to distribute free heroin to serious addicts, but even here, the
location of the house is being kept a strict secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neighbors think it will attract drug traffickers to the area.
But we certainly don't want it to be in an isolated part of town,
cut off from the community,'' says Kuiper.
</P>
<P>
   Local newspapers have been running stories about how drugs will
be delivered each day by the home's in-house dealer _ a claim
flatly denied by all involved. ``There will be no buying or
selling. Not in the house,'' Kuiper says.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end,'' he sighs, ``it all comes down to an acceptance
of drug use. At the heart of this debate is the question of whether
we can accept elderly people using heroin, even in small amounts.
I'm not sure everyone can. This might be too much, even for
Holland.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   BONN _ Germany's most persecuted minority hide behind an
answering machine. You leave a message, and wait for the
conspiratorial return call. Five days later, the phone rings at
last.
</P>
<P>
   ``You called, Herr Crackers,'' a woman intones in a soft voice.
``We are the Messies.''
</P>
<P>
   There is barely enough time to grab a pen. The caller is
wrestling with a baby, and her two other small children are making
noises in the background. A perfect moment, then, to conduct the
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Her name is Susanne Herms, she was teacher of English and
Religious Studies at a Gottingen grammar school before she started
planning a family. Now she is at home, and when she has some spare
time, she acts as the national coordinator for one of the
fastest-growing movements in the country: ``Messies Anonymous.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an American organization, invented by a Florida housewife,
which in Germany has found fertile soil. In just over two years, 40
local groups of ``Messies Anonymous'' have sprung up, organized _
if that is the right word _ by 300 contact persons.
</P>
<P>
   Herms, and the toddler who occasionally screams ``Mamma'' into
the receiver, are at the apex of this pyramid. What they and the
army of anonymous supporters who meet in secret locations up and
down the country have in common is their shameful secret: they are
disorganized.
</P>
<P>
   They rally behind the English word ``messy'' because the German
language does not have an equally forgiving equivalent. In their
native tongue their crime is ``Unordnung,'' the opposite of
``Ordnung,'' or order.
</P>
<P>
   Ordnung is what all Germans aspire to. To be lacking in Ordnung
is akin to being afflicted with bubonic plague.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a joke,'' Herms says. ``Many people laugh when you
miss an appointment or can't find your things. But there are
dramatic cases: people whose personal relationships break down
because of their Unordnung.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not punctual, you can lose your job. And you can
lose your friends if you don't dare to let them into your house,
because you're too messy.''
</P>
<P>
   Though you would never believe it, an estimated 10 percent of
Germans suffer from this ailment, and their numbers are rising.
</P>
<P>
   While scientists are coming to the conclusion that
disorganization is an inherited trait, the erosion of social
conventions is also blamed for increasing manifestations of this
aberrant behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Modernity and loose morals are wreaking havoc. A whole
generation of Germans has grown up never once having been clipped
around the ear for smudging the door handle in the kitchen. Some
others have, but they force themselves to be messy as a token of
rebellion against parental authority.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, young Germans protested against the world of
their elders by becoming urban guerrillas. Today they do it by
walking around with untied shoelaces.
</P>
<P>
   As the traditional society unravels, great changes are in store.
Soon it may no longer be commonplace to see the womenfolk of your
neighborhood sweeping the pavement in front of their houses at 8:25
every morning with a small broom and dustpan. There might even be a
noticeable decline in car hygiene in years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Until that happens, though, the disorganized must keep their
disability in the closet.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people in Germany are successful at work, but they
hide their disorganized home life,'' Herms says. Those who want to
come out can go to meetings of ``Messies Anonymous,'' to meet
like-minded people and receive tips on how to cope.
</P>
<P>
   This being an American movement, there are sure-fire cures,
developed by its patron saint, Sandra Felton. She has identified
three types of messies: the ``hoarder,'' the ``time messy'' and the
``chaos worker.''
</P>
<P>
   In the German environment, the second syndrome is the most
socially crippling. Once the malady is diagnosed, each sufferer is
offered a cure of his or her own.
</P>
<P>
   It says a lot about the advance of American civilization in the
late 20th century that even the Germans are turning to a Florida
guru to learn about ``Ordnung.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain, for once, is sadly lagging behind in domesticating this
bit of Americana. Despite the obviously higher proportion of slobs
residing across the Channel, Felton's book, published 16 years ago,
has bombed in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to the British publishers, this book doesn't suit
the British market,'' Herms says. ``British people who are
disorderly seem happy with their lifestyle.'' In Germany, though,
the book is selling like hot cakes. &QL;

   BONN _ Germany's most persecuted minority hide behind an
answering machine. You leave a message, and wait for the
conspiratorial return call. Five days later, the phone rings at
last.
</P>
<P>
   ``You called, Herr Crackers,'' a woman intones in a soft voice.
``We are the Messies.''
</P>
<P>
   There is barely enough time to grab a pen. The caller is
wrestling with a baby, and her two other small children are making
noises in the background. A perfect moment, then, to conduct the
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Her name is Susanne Herms, she was teacher of English and
Religious Studies at a Gottingen grammar school before she started
planning a family. Now she is at home, and when she has some spare
time, she acts as the national coordinator for one of the
fastest-growing movements in the country: ``Messies Anonymous.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an American organization, invented by a Florida housewife,
which in Germany has found fertile soil. In just over two years, 40
local groups of ``Messies Anonymous'' have sprung up, organized _
if that is the right word _ by 300 contact persons.
</P>
<P>
   Herms, and the toddler who occasionally screams ``Mamma'' into
the receiver, are at the apex of this pyramid. What they and the
army of anonymous supporters who meet in secret locations up and
down the country have in common is their shameful secret: they are
disorganized.
</P>
<P>
   They rally behind the English word ``messy'' because the German
language does not have an equally forgiving equivalent. In their
native tongue their crime is ``Unordnung,'' the opposite of
``Ordnung,'' or order.
</P>
<P>
   Ordnung is what all Germans aspire to. To be lacking in Ordnung
is akin to being afflicted with bubonic plague.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a joke,'' Herms says. ``Many people laugh when you
miss an appointment or can't find your things. But there are
dramatic cases: people whose personal relationships break down
because of their Unordnung.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not punctual, you can lose your job. And you can
lose your friends if you don't dare to let them into your house,
because you're too messy.''
</P>
<P>
   Though you would never believe it, an estimated 10 percent of
Germans suffer from this ailment, and their numbers are rising.
</P>
<P>
   While scientists are coming to the conclusion that
disorganization is an inherited trait, the erosion of social
conventions is also blamed for increasing manifestations of this
aberrant behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Modernity and loose morals are wreaking havoc. A whole
generation of Germans has grown up never once having been clipped
around the ear for smudging the door handle in the kitchen. Some
others have, but they force themselves to be messy as a token of
rebellion against parental authority.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, young Germans protested against the world of
their elders by becoming urban guerrillas. Today they do it by
walking around with untied shoelaces.
</P>
<P>
   As the traditional society unravels, great changes are in store.
Soon it may no longer be commonplace to see the womenfolk of your
neighborhood sweeping the pavement in front of their houses at 8:25
every morning with a small broom and dustpan. There might even be a
noticeable decline in car hygiene in years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Until that happens, though, the disorganized must keep their
disability in the closet.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people in Germany are successful at work, but they
hide their disorganized home life,'' Herms says. Those who want to
come out can go to meetings of ``Messies Anonymous,'' to meet
like-minded people and receive tips on how to cope.
</P>
<P>
   This being an American movement, there are sure-fire cures,
developed by its patron saint, Sandra Felton. She has identified
three types of messies: the ``hoarder,'' the ``time messy'' and the
``chaos worker.''
</P>
<P>
   In the German environment, the second syndrome is the most
socially crippling. Once the malady is diagnosed, each sufferer is
offered a cure of his or her own.
</P>
<P>
   It says a lot about the advance of American civilization in the
late 20th century that even the Germans are turning to a Florida
guru to learn about ``Ordnung.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain, for once, is sadly lagging behind in domesticating this
bit of Americana. Despite the obviously higher proportion of slobs
residing across the Channel, Felton's book, published 16 years ago,
has bombed in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to the British publishers, this book doesn't suit
the British market,'' Herms says. ``British people who are
disorderly seem happy with their lifestyle.'' In Germany, though,
the book is selling like hot cakes. &QL;

<P>
   TOKYO _ Everywhere you go in Tokyo _ hanging from the straps on
crowded underground trains, in cafes, restaurants, and in parks _
you will come across people reading ``manga,'' the plump, pulpy
Japanese comic books.
</P>
<P>
   There are kids' manga about sci-fi robots, sentimental ``ladies'
manga'' about young women looking for romance, and graphic
gentlemen's manga, featuring a different kind of lady in various
states of undress.
</P>
<P>
   But this year's most fashionable and original comic book could
hardly be more different: it is 400 pages long, packed with dense,
polemical text and bears the solemn title of ``Sensoron: Theory
About The War.''
</P>
<P>
   Its author is Yoshinori Kobayashi, a lean, bespectacled young
intellectual, a frequent guest on television discussion programs
and the principal character of his own comic strip.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, compiled from his bi-monthly contributions to a
popular magazine, Kobayashi orchestrates historical argument,
dramatized scenes of past and present, and horrible caricatures of
his intellectual adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   It all presents a simple message: that, contrary to the view
propagated in the West, Japan's invasions of Asia during the
Pacific War were not the brutal actions of a predatory colonizer.
They were a noble and valiant undertaking, carried out with
discipline and restraint, and their effect was to liberate Asians
from the colonial dominance of Western imperialists.
</P>
<P>
   This past weekend, a group of former Allied PoWs left Tokyo
bitterly disappointed after losing their claim for compensation and
apology. The pages of ``Sensoron,'' it is fair to predict, would
leave them in despair.
</P>
<P>
   A typical sequence of frames shows ugly Caucasians with fat lips
and outsized noses sticking Union Jacks, Stars and Stripes and
Tricolors into a map of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In the next box, stern but noble Japanese soldiers surge across
the map, snapping the puny flags to the chagrin of the hideous
whiteys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The white Western countries thought of colored people like us
as primitive monkeys and colonized the countries of East Asia,''
runs the text. ``It was the Japanese army which beat them. Let's
give them a round of applause.''
</P>
<P>
   There has always been a strain of such thinking in Japan _ in
Tokyo and most big cities, so-called ``rightists'' can be seen
every day blaring martial music from black trucks painted with
rising suns, and eulogizing the Emperor.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the din, few Japanese regarded them as more than noisy
middle-aged eccentrics. Kobayashi, by contrast, is young,
widely-read and cool.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, the success of his comic has fostered a
surprising and in some ways an alarming trend _ a revival of
right-wing revisionism about Japan's war among the youngest and
cleverest Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never used to talk to my friends about these things, but
it's all changed in the last two years,'' says Tomomi Yamada, a
26-year old magazine editor, and a fan of ``Sensoron.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're Japanese, and you start raising questions about
Japan in the war, people always used to point the finger and say,
`rightist!' Now my friends talk about it and a lot of them agree
with me. It's terrific, and Kobayashi has had a big influence.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan's right-wing revival has little in common with those of
Europe and _ with her polite English and fluffy sweater _ Ms.
Yamada could hardly be further from a drooling neo-Nazi. Once a
month she attends a meeting of the Japan Public Opinion Society, a
discussion group of like-minded people, to hear speeches by
conservative historians.
</P>
<P>
   These days as many as half the members of the audience are her
own age; when she first attended, three years ago, very few were.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the speakers were saying was so different from what we
were taught in school, that Japan fought an aggressive war,'' she
says. ``It was shocking and new, and very attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   A frequent subject of discussion is the 1937 Rape of Nanking.
According to most Western and many Japanese historians, the
imperial army embarked on an orgy of killing, looting and rape
which left at least 100,000 dead _ the Chinese reckon it could have
been as many as 300,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``To kill 300,000 you would need two nuclear bombs,'' asserts
Kobayashi. ``It couldn't be done with Japanese guns.''
</P>
<P>
   His book has gone through 17 printings and some 400,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   This year's most successful Japanese film was ``Pride,'' an epic
eulogy to Hideki Tojo, the wartime prime minister hanged as a war
criminal 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Over a million copies have been sold of a series of books
entitled ``The History Which The Textbooks Don't Teach,'' by a
group of revisionist historians irritated with the increasingly
liberal tenor of history teaching in schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese are depicted as criminals on whose shoulders fate
has placed the burden of atoning for their sins for generations to
come,'' says one of the authors, Professor Nobukatsu Fujioka of
Tokyo University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Current Japanese textbooks include the wartime propaganda of
former enemies, treating it as though it were historical fact.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 850. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Unlike Western neo-Nazis, Japanese revisionists have never
turned their intellectual agenda into any kind of political action,
and the numbers of committed activists is probably small, even if
their influence is increasing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends very much on social conditions, and whether the
economic situation gets worse or not,'' says Tesuya Miyazaki, a
writer who frequently speaks out against Kobayashi and his views.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the post-war period everyone in Japan thought of themselves
as middle class, but now things are changing and gaps are opening
up between the top and bottom, and between parents and children.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the confusion that Kobayashi speaks to _ it's not that
people are trying to revive the spirit of the war, just a feeling
of togetherness.'' &QL;

c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; 'Tis the season for opulence and office parties.
</P>
<P>
   The economy is up, businesses are celebrating, and people are
excited about dressing up again, says Milinda Martin, fashion
spokeswoman for Robinsons-May stores. But after such a long dry
spell, many employees don't have a clue about what's new and
yule-cool, much less about office politics to keep your name out of
the rumor mill.
</P>
<P>
   So is it safer for women to wear basic black or go for festive
red festooned in feathers? Are sweaters better or should
corporate-climbing guys invest in vests?
</P>
<P>
   ``The office party is one of the most difficult social events to
dress for because you need to get the right mix between festive and
professional,'' says Martin. ``One of the best options is what we
call evening sportswear, items that can be interchanged to dress up
an outfit.''
</P>
<P>
   Think color. Think sparkle. Think simple but elegant.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds easy enough, right? Yeah, sure.
</P>
<P>
   We loaded the car with clothes and put style standards to the
test by consulting that fashionably frisky office staff on the set
of NBC's sitcom ``Working,'' and even the actors who play the
dysfunctionally funny crew couldn't settle on the same look.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Savage, who plays young college graduate Matt Peyser,
traded his trademark business suit for a cheery red pull-over
sweater with polo shirt detailing by Tommy Hilfiger. ``Nothing too
flashy ... I like to be casual,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Too flashy? There's no such phrase in Debi Mazar's world, thank
you very much. The newest addition to the ensemble cast plays Liz,
a saucy and ambitious office worker with an in-your-face 'tude, who
likes high drama in her wardrobe. With a toss of her red
fur-trimmed stole, Mazar advised, ``Always wear something you'd
never wear during office hours. You want them to talk!''
</P>
<P>
   So much for staying out of the rumor mill. At this rate, she'll
be the talk of the office the Monday after _ unless Arden Myrin
gets her way.
</P>
<P>
   Myrin, who plays perky Abby, the unofficial office cheerleader,
also goes for the glam, zeroing in on a red and leopard print
velvet number by Mica.
</P>
<P>
   As she tries on the dress, she explains, ``Abby's a little
naive, like a cruise director or a sorority girl who's just so
organized and cares so much about social events, so she'd want a
complete ensemble, like this velvet dress. And that coat with the
feathers. And the tiara.''
</P>
<P>
   She's not alone. Not only are feathers and tiaras showing up at
stores all over the country, but velvet is one of the hottest
fabrics of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Says style authority Leah Feldon, who's the author of ``Dress
Like a Million _ On Considerably Less'' and fashion consultant for
Wards stores, ``Fabrics with textures, sparkle and color are what
will make the biggest impact at the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Hytner, the ``Working'' cast's bitter and sarcastic
Delaney, was hip to the vibe on velvet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the all-black look with a turtleneck sweater is in, but
my character wouldn't wear the matching sweater,'' Hytner says as
he tosses the sweater and buttons up a white dress shirt with his
night-clubby Claiborne blazer and trousers in black velveteen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Party tips? You need false sincerity (to impress the boss and
score with chicks).
</P>
<P>
   ``The best attitude after you've made a fool of yourself?
Denial!
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, if they've got actual photos of you misbehaving, you'd
better have your own set of photos,'' he quips.
</P>
<P>
   Then Maurice Godin jumped into the fashion fest.
</P>
<P>
   The actor who plays the opportunistic, morally challenged
corporate boss, says, ``Ahh, the office party rules. I know ...
never get drunker than the boss. And always watch to see who the
boss is hitting on and steer clear of that person.''
</P>
<P>
   Suiting up in an elegant Hugo Boss suit and knotting his Donna
Karan tie, Godin laughs. ``Oh, you wanted real advice? I think you
should consider having it away from the office so everyone is on
the same footing, and can feel free to wear what they want,'' he
suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Myrin is back in the dressing room to change into another party
dress, and confesses she's having a blast. ``When it comes to
dressing up, I tend to overdo it. I like boas, big red lips ... and
anything frivolous. And I have lots of tiaras,'' she explains.
``But I guess if I were giving advice to a new person in the
office, I'd say, `Look pretty, but not too sexy. And work the
outskirts of the party instead of being the center of attention so
you won't be talked about.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line? ``To avoid career suicide, never step out of
character,'' says Yvette Freeman, who plays Evelyn, the bossy
know-it-all office manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``My character is a hard-nosed company liner, so she wants to
show the staff she does have a fun side. But no party hat,'' she
snaps.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca McFarland, who plays the ultra-sexy secretary, refused
to wear a party hat, too. She squeezed into a slinky gown, loaded
herself down with rhinestones, and wrapped up in a big boa and
stretched out on the sofa.
</P>
<P>
   Uh-oh. A low-cut dress isn't what most fashion mavens or
professional consultants would advise. A much safer fashion
alternative for office parties is a sweater, says Martin, because
it's festive and glam but not overly sexy.
</P>
<P>
   McFarland changes into a sweater, but she's still a tad too
saucy.
</P>
<P>
   If you're in doubt, consider Martin's rule when in a
professional party setting: ``Never expose skin in more than one
place at one time. If you've got a slit up your skirt, don't have a
bare back.''

 &HT;    WOULD-BE COUP LEADER POISED TO WIN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN
VENEZUELA
 &HT;    With VENEZUELA-BOX-$ADV05.
 &HT;    For Use Saturday, Dec. 5 And Thereafter.

<P>
   MIAMI _ His critics paint him as a cross between a terrorist and
the devil, someone who opposes trade, supports rebellion, and
hasn't been able to get a U.S. visa since he came close to toppling
his country's democratic government in 1992 with a would-be coup.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Lt. Col. Hugo Chavez, a controversial but charismatic
populist, is the front-runner in Sunday's(Dec. 6) much-anticipated
presidential election in Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Known as ``El Comandante,'' he's won widespread appeal by vowing
to shake up the state oil industry, which he says has failed to
benefit the poorest in Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   ``Venezuela is a big supplier of oil so the United States is
frightened of this left-leaning candidate who brings a lot of
uncertainty to the country's future,'' said Larry Birns, head of
the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, a Washington, D.C., think tank.
</P>
<P>
   His allure lies in pledges to fight corruption and dissolve
congress in order to create a ``new democracy'' that would improve
the lots of rich and poor alike.
</P>
<P>
   But Chavez, 44, also has hinted that he might introduce price
controls, stop payments on Venezuela's foreign debt, and use more
protectionist policies to close the country's borders to most
trade.
</P>
<P>
   This has provoked uneasiness among those in the middle and upper
classes, who fear he might impose a dictatorship and roll back
free-market reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Chavez has some so concerned that current President
Rafael Caldera's army chief recently implied that the armed forces
might even try to block Chavez's ascent to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   With so much uncertainty, the candidates have asked the
Atlanta-based Carter Center to monitor the election, which could
prove to be a turning point in the nation's 40 years of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview with Cox News Service, former U.S.
President Jimmy Carter said Chavez had previously indicated that he
may not accept the election results unless he wins.
</P>
<P>
   But later, after a lengthy conversation with Carter, Chavez
apparently indicated that he will accept the election results, even
if he loses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy is in danger, at least in the opinion of many
Venezuelans, if the election is not successful,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Carter will head up a 26-person delegation to monitor the
elections, a team that will include former U.S. Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady and former Chilean President Patricio Aylwin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Venezuelan people want, almost unanimously, dramatic
change in their government, and they want peaceful change,'' Carter
said.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's leftist Patriotic Pole coalition, made up of 14 minor
parties, won a stunning victory in legislative and gubernatorial
elections on Nov. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Now Chavez stands a good chance of being elected president,
riding high on a tide of discontent with traditional parties over
government corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The latest polls show Chavez with about 50 percent of the vote
and his closest challenger, Henrique Salas, 62, with 38 percent of
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Both have run independently, although the Yale-educated Salas is
believed to be more mainstream and is more favored by the business
community.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Venezuela's largest political party, Democratic
Action, decided to dump its candidate and support Salas in a final,
last-ditch move to keep Chavez from winning.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela's other main party, the Social Christian COPEI,
followed suit on Wednesday, dropping its candidate, former Miss
Universe Irene Saez, to back Salas.
</P>
<P>
   Saez, even though her popularity has plummeted in recent months,
plans to remain as an independent candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Venezuelans have been going through bad economic times and are
demanding political change,'' said Jennifer McCoy, director of the
Carter Center's Latin American and Caribbean Program. ``The rise of
all these independent candidates is the manifestation of the
political change.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Chavez helped plot an attempted coup against former
President Carlos Andres Perez, claiming he was corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Perez was impeached and removed from office a year later after
being found guilty of misusing public money.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Caldera pardoned Chavez, who has has spent the last
four years building grassroots support among the more than 70
percent of the country's population that are considered poor.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has not been so forgiving. It still deems
Chavez ``ineligible'' for a U.S. visa because of his role in the
failed coup attempt.
</P>
<P>
   With 23 million people and the largest oil reserves outside the
Middle East, Venezuela is the main supplier of oil to the U.S.
market and is Latin America's fourth-largest economy.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, many Venezuelans have accused the government of
frittering away their oil-rich country's vast wealth, hence the
dissatisfaction with traditional parties has grown.
</P>
<P>
   According to the United Nations, more than half the country's
wealth goes to the richest 20 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Adding fuel to the fire is an economy that's been hammered this
year by soaring inflation, a jumpy stock market, a sharply
overvalued currency, and oil prices that are at their lowest point
in years.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, especially those in the oil industry, are becoming
increasingly unnerved by the possibility of a Chavez win and some
have already fled the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst scenario is that anyone who has any resources will
get out of the country, turning Venezuela into a gigantic ghetto,''
said Jerry Haar, a Latin American expert at the University of
Miami's North-South Center. ``The business community and Chavez are
going to have to find a way to work together even if that community
doesn't support him.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez also has pledged to dismiss the president of the state
oil company Petroleos de Venezuela S.A., Luis Giusti, a
highly-regarded oil executive who helped open the nationalized oil
sector up to outside companies.
</P>
<P>
   Companies such as Mobil Corp., Exxon Corp., Texaco Inc., and
Atlantic Richfield Co. recently returned to Venezuela for the first
time in decades under Venezuela's plan to double oil production
within 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Chavez has backed away from some of his earlier,
more-controversial threats including one to take dictatorial
powers.
</P>
<P>
   He's even lobbied the U.S. government for official recognition
and has, recently, pledged to improve ties with Washington if
elected despite being denied a U.S. visa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chavez is certainly considered to be a radical, but he will
make concessions,'' Birns said. ``Everybody has to when they are
confronted by the realities of being a leader.''

SECRET SOCIETY OF HAPPY PEOPLE: GRIN AND SHARE IT
</HEADLINE>
 PEOPLE-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LIZ STEVENS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're happy and you know it ...
</P>
<P>
   ... keep it to yourself, thanks.
</P>
<P>
   Happiness, it sometimes seems, has gone the way of Tab cola and
Milli Vanilli, fading into oblivion. It's hip to be hopeless,
stylish to be stressed and popular to be a pitiable sap spreading
gloom and bad juju. Even Ann Landers seems to be toeing the ``No
one wants to hear about your good fortune'' line.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's the Jerry Springer effect.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it is, Pam Johnson is tired of it; she's not mad, mind
you, because that would be a waste of mental energy. Instead, she
is doing something to counteract the widespread negativity she
encounters daily.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Johnson founded the Secret Society of Happy People.
It might sound corny (OK, it does sound corny), but Johnson's
message strikes a universal chord: We spend way too much time
whining about our problems and way too little time acknowledging
the good moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 100-something 12-step groups that exist, and that
has a place in our society,'' Johnson says, ``but there's really
not much out there that says, `It's OK to be happy, just because.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Think about conversations with friends, family and co-workers:
They probably focus on negative events, Johnson notes. ``If you go
to work and you tell people that you're happy, people make jokes;
they don't want to hear it,'' she adds. On the other hand, ``If you
have a horrible morning, you get a lot of sympathy.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson points to a recent Ann Landers column in which the
advice maven agreed with writers who insisted that people who send
holiday cards should omit their good news: ``Spare us the details
of the Ivy League schools your children are attending and the
honors and awards they have received during the year ...'' wrote
the ornery ``Your Cousins in Illinois.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Johnson drafted a news release calling the column
``a blatant public example'' of the attitude she is combating, and
sent it via overnight mail to various TV personalities and
talk-show hosts.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who lives in Irving, began teaching personal
empowerment workshops at local community centers several years
back. Her clients encouraged her to publish a newsletter, and
Johnson added a humor column following the antics of a fictitious
Secret Society of Happy People. The made-up members of SSOHP were
so vilified by the outside world that they wore bags over their
heads when attending meetings.
</P>
<P>
   But then real people started asking Johnson if they could join
the club, and voila: The Web site (www.sohp.com) went up in
September, the first newsletter is scheduled for mailing this
month, and more than 50 people nationwide have coughed up $30 to
become official members. (Each one receives a T-shirt, lapel pin,
bumper sticker, quarterly newsletter and opportunity for a pen
pal.)
</P>
<P>
   The goal of SSOHP is to move people away from bonding based on
``woundology,'' a term coined by ``Anatomy of the Spirit'' author
Caroline Myss. ``I don't think there's anything wrong with
overcoming your wounds,'' says Johnson, 32. ``But we've come to a
place where we wear them like a badge of courage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of very heavy things in life day-to-day, either
personally or worldwide, and I think sometimes this whole idea of
happiness does get lost,'' says Joan Teeter, a SSOHP member in
Waverly, N.Y. Teeter, like Johnson, works as a regional
representative for the publishing arm of the Minnesota-based
Hazelden Foundation, famous for its addiction-treatment center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people become connected through pain, and I'm
not saying that that's a bad thing,'' Teeter adds. ``But there
seems to be this component that that's all they talk about, and
there's so much more to life than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson urges a stop-and-smell-the-roses approach. Give as much
time to dwelling on the great things in life as to the cruddy
stuff, she says, and encourage others to share positive thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people laugh at me at first, and then they get it,''
Johnson says. ``It's one of those things that they already somewhat
know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you deal with people who have a positive outlook, who
aren't afraid to be happy and admit that they're happy, it tends to
rub off,'' says Andre Freimann, a neighbor of Johnson's and SSOHP
member. ``You know, when you smile, other people smile.''

MOURNING A LOSS TOO OFTEN IGNORED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since the day the postman turned it over to me nearly eight
years ago, the small wooden box _ about 2 inches by 4 inches _ has
sat undisturbed on the mantel in my den.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I had the emotional strength to open it, to touch the
ashes inside, to smell them, but I don't. I had loved Snuggles _
the Samoyed my husband gave me as a wedding present _ as if she
were a child.
</P>
<P>
   Just about the time we were settled into our new home in Fort
Worth and were ready to send for Snuggles, my friend who had been
caring for her in Sacramento called to say that mu dog had died.
Rather than bury her in California, I asked that she be cremated
and her ashes forwarded. The thought of having her so far away was
too painful.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think much about losing Snuggles anymore; somehow, I
find comfort in the presence of that small wooden box. There is no
such comfort, however, when I remember the baby I miscarried.
</P>
<P>
   He was at 11 weeks gestation, and few states, if any, would even
consider him human.
</P>
<P>
   And so today, I hope someone will read my words and do for me
and other North Texas women who've lost their babies what the
Milton S. Hershey Medical Center has done for women in
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks ago, I read a story on the news wire about a
$12,000 communal burial site for stillborn babies, miscarriages and
ectopic pregnancies had been dedicated in September and will be
maintained by the medical center through private donations.
</P>
<P>
   Graveside services will be held quarterly, and infants will be
buried in common graves, each marked by a gray stone. The first
memorial service was held Nov. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Such burial sites are becoming increasingly common, said Fran
Rybarik, director of Bereavement Services of Gundersen Lutheran
Medical Center in La Crosse, Wis., the model for the Hershey
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we do the training, we ask people to look at what's
available and fill the gap,'' Rybarik said. ``But not all programs
opt to provide the burial site.''
</P>
<P>
   At least two Fort Worth hospitals, John Peter Smith and Harris
Methodist downtown, offer services to couples who have lost a baby
through miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth or neonatal
death. At John Peter Smith, an annual memorial service is held for
people who have suffered those sorts of losses. A marker dedicated
to ``the memories of our babies'' stands at the hospital's west
entrance, proclaiming ``our tears for lost smiles, our grief for
lost dreams and our courage to find them.'' But although some
funeral homes provide a designated area for infants, no common
burial ground is available in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   In a world that sometimes seems to honor its pets more than it
does its children, it is the least we can do.
</P>
<P>
   Because there are few, if any, tangible memories of these
infants, ``many people minimize the loss,'' said Dan Baker,
coordinator of John Peter Smith's perinatal bereavement program.
</P>
<P>
   To alleviate the problem, both Fort Worth hospitals work to
create memories for parents when possible, taking pictures of the
infant, for instance, or allowing parents to hold the baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes people want to view the baby, even if it's just
tissue,'' Baker said. ``We don't push this on people, but if they
need to do that, it's very therapeutic.''
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the size of the fetus _ 20 weeks gestation or more
under Texas law _ some parents are given a birth and death
certificate.
</P>
<P>
   But if you miscarry before then, as I did 10 years ago, there
are no tangible memories. It is as if your baby never existed.
</P>
<P>
   A common burial ground could help change that.

   TOO MUCH SMOTHERING
</P>
<P>
   Q. Three years ago, I transplanted three rhubarb plants. I
smother them with manure early in spring, during the summer and at
the end of the summer. Yet, all I get are thin stalks, although
they came from a plant that gave my friends wide stalks.
</P>
<P>
   A. It sounds as if you might be smothering them more than they
can stand. Rhubarb is a heavy feeder, it's true, and composted
manure is a fine fertilizer, especially if you are using what my
neighbors call ``hen dressing.'' But too much of a good thing is
still too much; one generous application each year should be
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Heap it on in late fall, after the plants have gone fully
dormant, or in early spring, before they start active growth. Give
them a side dressing of compost in mid-spring and a small amount of
balanced commercial fertilizer _ or more composted manure _ when
you are almost done harvesting. Be sure to mulch heavily all
through the growing season. Rhubarb does best when its roots stay
cool and get plenty of moisture.
</P>
<P>
   Thin stalks may simply mean that the plants are young and not
yet well established, but they can also indicate overcrowding.
Rhubarb plants should be at least three feet apart in all
directions.
</P>
<P>
   Shade might also be the culprit. Although rhubarb will survive
low-light conditions, it must be grown in full sun to produce
thick, flavorful stalks.
</P>
<P>
   Tilden, a variety that has very broad stalks, is available from
Fedco Trees, P.O. Box 520, Waterville, Maine 04903-0520; (207)
878-7333; catalog, $2. Chipman's Canada Red, which can be a bit
sweeter and is noted for strong color that comes through cooking
well, is sold by Henry Field's Seed and Nursery, 415 North Burnett,
Shenandoah, Iowa 51602; (605) 665-4491; free catalog.

   WINTERING HOSTAS
</P>
<P>
   Q. I grew hostas in pots this past summer. How do I keep them
over the winter?
</P>
<P>
   A. Tough perennials like hostas don't mind frozen ground, but
they suffer when subjected to repeated freeze-thaw cycles, and most
pots hold so little soil they make such cycles likely. Repeated
freezing and thawing is also hard on the pots themselves: plastic
becomes increasingly brittle, terra cotta tends to chip and crack,
and even cement may break if tiny fissures get filled with water
that swells into ice over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   You can store the potted hostas in an unheated garage or shed
where temperatures stay between 32 and 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Or
you can protect both plants and pots by burying them right up to
the rim. Make sure the soil around clay pots is free of rocks that
might shift and cause damage. Mulch after the ground freezes to
help it stay frozen.
</P>
<P>
   Truly huge ``estate size'' planters (think the bottom third of a
telephone booth) may be left in place; there's safety in volume.
But pots that fall in the middle _ too big to bury, too small to
trust _ should be emptied. Same goes for planters made of wood,
which is vulnerable to rot. Transfer the plants to plastic pots,
and store or bury them as above; then, turn the planters upside
down so water doesn't collect in them.
</P>
<P>
   All else failing, just group the pots together and insulate as
best you can. There's a good chance they'll come through fine.

MAKERS OF SKIS, BATS AND BIKES TRY A NEW TECHNOLOGY TO ABSORB
SHOCKS

<P>
   Just off the two-lane highway that runs through Washington
State's lush Vashon Island sits the wood-paneled headquarters of
the K2 Corp. Although Vashon is the kind of place where, just down
the road from the company, people leave their trucks unlocked, keys
in the ignition, while they purchase chicken feed, K2 seems more
standoffish.
</P>
<P>
   In its front window, the company has a sign posted prominently
that says, ``Sorry, No Factory Tours.'' At mention of the sign,
Andy Luhn, a company spokesman, shrugs and mutters something about
espionage.
</P>
<P>
   It is here that the first convergence took place of commercial
sports equipment and piezoelectric technology, a way of translating
mechanical energy (shocks, bumps, vibrations and the like) into
electricity and heat.
</P>
<P>
   The technology was developed largely in secret during both world
wars and has been used in military, medical, aerospace, automotive
and industrial products. But in 1995, the release of the K2 Four
``smart ski'' introduced the first high-volume commercial
application of piezoelectricity for vibration control in sports
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, a handful of sports equipment manufacturers have
begun embedding piezoelectric (the first part is pronounced
pee-AY-zoh) modules in snowboards, mountain bicycles, baseball bats
and water skis, in some cases using microprocessors to improve the
modules' performance. Next year, a piezo-enhanced golf club should
be available.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The warning sign in front of K2's factory seems in keeping with
the company's portrayal of itself as groundbreaking innovator for
having wed piezoelectric technology to sports equipment. ``I guess
we take it for granted that it's very revolutionary,'' Luhn said.
</P>
<P>
   Some the users and makers of rival skis, snowboards and
bicycles, however, aren't so sure. While no one questions the basic
workings of piezoeletric materials, not everyone is enamored of the
results on the slope or the mountain. And where some see
revolution, others see gimmick.
</P>
<P>
   Among the skeptics is Soren Wolff, a ski instructor at Squaw
Valley USA, near Lake Tahoe, Calif. Wolff owns a pair of K2 Fours _
but his motive for buying them might not be what the marketing
people at K2 had in mind. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a slave to fashion,'' he said. ``I thought they were cool
looking. They brought the retro pattern back.'' Wolff was referring
to the red, white and blue striped design recycled from the
original 1971 K2 Four ski.
</P>
<P>
   So how well do the skis work?
</P>
<P>
   ``To be completely honest, I'd say it's more of a novelty,''
Wolff said. ``But, yeah, it works. If a person has achieved a
certain amount of proficiency, anything will work. People are going
to get on a ski, and it turns left and right.''
</P>
<P>
   A representative of a competitor of K2 had a harsher assessment.
``It's just a gadget, and people like gadgets,'' said Daniel
Morney, Rossignol Ski Co.'s vice president of racing and
promotions.
</P>
<P>
   The technology has also brought mixed reviews from the other
sports where it has been applied. Dan Grausam, an expert-class
mountain bicycle racer in Berkeley, Calif., said he was not
impressed by the piezo in the K2 bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``While they're certainly adequate bikes, the piezoelectric
system hasn't really revolutionized suspension,'' Grausam said.
``If you believe K2's marketing hype, right, it's like they're the
only company that does this and it's the best thing in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, a lot of people ride them and race them
successfully. But they're not the end-all, be-all of suspension.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The physics behind piezoelectric technology is well established.
Piezoelectric materials convert mechanical impulses to electrical
energy, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Hall, associate professor of aeronautics and astronautics
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the technology
should transfer well to skis.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that you could measure it in a laboratory
and it would be a significant effect,'' said Hall, who added that
he is a friend of one of the developers of the piezoelectric module
that K2 uses. ``I know that in similar kinds of systems, when you
use piezos to do damping, you can get significant levels. So it
ought to work in a ski as well as in any other system.`
</P>
<P>
   In a ski equipped with the devices, vibrations are damped down
by very thin piezoceramic plates. The plates absorb joint-jarring
vibrations and convert them to harmless electrical impulses relayed
through wires to an electronic shunt circuit. The electricity
lights up a small red or green LED (light-emitting diode). The
excess energy dissipates as heat.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, with the plates installed, instead of knocking you
off your feet, tough runs should merely light up a tiny spot on
your ski.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain bike shock absorbers use the technology somewhat
differently. Electronic sensors monitor how bumpy the ride is and
relay that information to the piezoceramic ``bender'' plates.
Rather than converting the mechanical energy to electrical energy
and dispersing it, the piezoceramic plate converts the electrical
signal back to mechanical energy.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the ceramic bends, letting varying amounts of oil
flow to the bicycle's shock absorbers, as needed, for cushioning
against the world's roots, rocks and off-road trails. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Piezoelectric devices are by no means the only method on the
high-end sporting goods market right now to reduce vibration.
``Everybody's got something,'' said Sean English, manager of the
San Francisco outdoor equipment store Any Mountain. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rossignol, for example, has the patented ``VAS,''or Vibration
Absorbing System, which uses a viscoelastic material, a kind of
rubber. Other damping materials include products that use wood,
titanium or synthetics.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   For outdoor sports, however, especially those during the winter,
one of the advantages of piezoceramics is that they ``experience
almost zero temperature sensitivity,'' said Brian Mulcahey, a
spokesman for the Actice Control eXperts of Cambridge, Mass. ACX,
as the company is known, produces all of the piezoceramic modules
currently used in sports products. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Piezoelectric technology predates modern, so-called ``smart''
sports products by more than a century. It was the scientists
Jacques and Pierre Curie who discovered that quartz and other
crystals emitted electricity when subjected to mechanical stress. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Examples of the process can be found in everyday life. All that
is needed, for example, are two of the decidedly low-tech quartz
rocks commonly found on the beach, said John Frank, an engineer at
Ideo Product Development of Palo Alto, Calif. who has helped
develop piezoelectric applications. ``They're called `flash
rocks,''' he said. ``When you throw them against the floor, they
spark.
</P>
<P>
   While piezoelectric quartz crystals were used after World War I
in a myriad of products, from sonar submarine detectors to crystal
radios, the crystals were hard to produce. ``Cutting the quartz
crystals was some sort of black art that companies would spend
years and years trying to master, said Frank. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, isolated research groups in the United
States, the Soviet Union and Japan found piezoelectric capacities
in certain ceramics that were easier to produce than cutting
crystals.
</P>
<P>
   While piezoceramics have been used since they were first
manufactured, they are typically brittle, expensive, and very
fragile. The process of soldering wires to the ceramic to harness
the electricity often caused irreparable breakage, making mass
consumer applications like the K2 skis impractical.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Lazurus, co-founder of ACX, worked with raw piezoceramics at
MIT's Space Engineering Research Center while completing his PhD.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no technique for making these in high volume,'' said
Mulcahey. He said Lazurus was the one who figured out how to
mass-produce them.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the ACX module is the innovative packaging: a
plastic-like material called polyimide that protects the ceramic
and eliminates the need for soldering wires directly onto it.
</P>
<P>
   Because ACX's innovation renders the technology relatively
durable and inexpensive, sports equipment manufacturers like K2,
O'Brien International and Worth Inc. can add the vibration-damping
module to their products without making them exponentially more
expensive. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The innovations in the original K2 Four piezoelectric ski damped
up to 70 percent of the ski's vibrations, according to K2, which
says that in its first full year of sales, the K2 Four was the best
selling ski in the nation. An entire line of K2 skills _ the Merlin
series _ now uses the dampers, and all told about a third of the
company's skis have the piezo module implanted.
</P>
<P>
   Skiers with a taste for the high-tech, however, will have to pay
more for the privilege. The piezo-enhanced Merlin III, for example,
costs $565, while the roughly comparable K2 Three, without any
damper, costs $425_ a $140 price difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've increased the price of the high-end end product by about
a hundred dollars,'' said Mulcahey.
</P>
<P>
   Peizoelectric devices have also increased the cost of the other
sports products to which they have been added.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Mapple, the 1998 slalom waterskiing World Cup Champion,
helped design the piezoelectric enhanced ``Mapple Siege'' slalom
ski. Released by O'Brien International in September, the Mapple
Siege and its fellow piezo-enhanced ski, the Vision GT, are the
latest piezo sports products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only drawback is that it adds expense,'' said Mapple, who
tested the skis in several World Cup events. ``With any sport or
anything else, you pay for the technology.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Vision GT is just over $200 more than a non-piezo ski a
notch down on the line. And even Mapple thinks that the vibration
damping advance won't eliminate the skill needed to ski well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure that putting piezos in the ski will make you ski
more buoys,'' he said, ``but it will make you ski more buoys more
often.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The costs of the technology can be driven still higher, because
some manufacturers have begun combining piezoelectric devices with
microchips. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In October 1997, for example, K2 BIKE, a division of K2, came
out with a ``smart shock'' system based on ACX's technology.
</P>
<P>
   An electronic sensor determines whether or not shock-absorbtion
is needed and how much (if the rider hits a boulder, say, he or she
needs harder shock than if he or she hits a molehill).
</P>
<P>
   The sensor sends a signal to a microprocessor, which then sends
an electric signal to the piezo module. The piezoceramic reacts
with a mechanical impulse: It moves, allowing more or less oil into
the shock for greater or less cushioning. K2 BIKE now uses
piezoelectric modules in 70 percent of its products.

HOME REPAIR: HANDLING POP-UP STOPPER PROBLEMS IN THE SINK

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today most bathroom sinks have pop-up stoppers instead of the
old-fashioned rubber plugs. Generally pop-up stoppers work well,
but over time they may become clogged with hair or other debris and
fall out of alignment. Then they may not open or close properly.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, these stoppers are easy to repair. The tools
required are simple ones, usually only a screwdriver and a pair of
pliers. The repair procedure consists of disassembly, cleaning and
reassembly. After all the parts are in place, it may be necessary
to readjust the linkage so the stopper closes properly. While
adjustments are straightforward, it may take a little
experimentation to get them just right.
</P>
<P>
   Usually the pop-up stopper and connecting linkage consists of
five parts. The stopper is, of course, positioned in the throat of
the drain pipe. When it is down, it contains the water in the sink.
Raising the stopper allows the water to drain.
</P>
<P>
   The base of the stopper connects with a pivot rod that runs
through a fitting in the drain pipe to mate with a clevis directly
under the lift knob on the sink. The pivot rod has a ball
positioned midpoint on its shaft. The ball acts as a fulcrum and
allows the rod to swing up and down and activate the stopper.
</P>
<P>
   The clevis is a piece of flat metal perforated with a series of
adjustment holes. Not all sinks have a clevis. Instead, the pivot
rod may connect directly to a vertical rod from the lift knob. The
clevis, however, is useful because it makes it easier to adjust the
action of the stopper.
</P>
<P>
   The lift knob on top of the sink raises and lowers the stopper.
It has a vertical rod that runs through the sink and connects with
the clevis below. The two pieces are held together with a set
screw. Pulling up on the lift knob causes the pivot rod to raise on
one end and pull the stopper down at the other. Pushing down on the
knob reverses the action.
</P>
<P>
   If the stopper fails to close properly, the linkage may be out
of alignment or the stopper may be clogged with debris or hair.
It's best to remove the stopper and examine it before attempting to
adjust the linkage. On some sinks, the stopper only rests on the
pivot rod and can easily be removed by pulling it straight up.
Other stoppers have a locking notch that grips the pivot rod. To
remove this type of stopper, give it a quarter turn
counterclockwise then lift up.
</P>
<P>
   There is also another kind of stopper that connects to the pivot
rod with a retaining ring. It cannot be removed from the drain
until the pivot rod is pulled free. This is neither complicated nor
difficult. Use a pair of channel pliers (wrap the plier jaws with
masking tape so they do not damage the fitting) to loosen the nut
at the drain fitting, then pull back the pivot rod. This will free
the stopper so you can remove it.
</P>
<P>
   Once the stopper is free, examine it carefully. Clean it, if
necessary, then look at stopper head. Some stoppers have an O-ring
around the head. When the stopper is down, the O-ring seals the
drain to keep water from seeping past the stopper. If the O-ring is
cracked or flattened, it cannot make an effective seal, so replace
it.
</P>
<P>
   Clean the stopper and the inside of the drain pipe, then
reposition the stopper by reversing the removal procedure. Before
pushing the pivot rod back into place, inspect the two washers, or
gaskets, positioned on either side of the ball-fulcrum. Make sure
these are in good condition. Cracked or worn washers will allow
water from the drain to leak past the retaining nut on the drain
fitting.
</P>
<P>
   You are now ready to adjust the linkage so the stopper moves
correctly in the drain. It is best to start by adjusting the lift
rod-clevis connection. The adjustment is made by loosening the set
screw that holds the clevis and lift rod. Use a short screwdriver
or a pair of pliers (wrap the jaws with masking tape) to loosen the
set screw (for stubborn screws you may need a few drops of
penetrating oil), then slide the clevis up or down to reposition
the stopper.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to adjust the travel of the stopper is by moving the
pivot rod up or down into a different hole in the clevis rod. The
rod is held in place with a spring clip. Squeeze the clip, then
slide the rod free. Move the rod and clip to another hole, then try
closing the stopper again. These adjustment procedures are easy
enough, but you will have to work under the sink in a cramped and
confined space. Be careful to avoid bumping your head on the sink.

BORN AT 1 POUND 3 OUNCES, BABY IS A MIRACLE OF SURVIVAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   She came out a little, purple ball, hands flying and feet
kicking furiously in all directions, Baby Zoe's mother recalls.
Because Zoe was a ``border baby,'' born at just 23 weeks gestation,
she was thought to have a 1 percent probability of surviving more
than a week.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because she refused to uncurl those tiny legs and hold
still, Zoe Caldwell's length at birth was estimated at 6 inches.
She was officially still under 12 inches when she was measured at
one month, according to records at Harris Methodist Fort Worth,
where the premature infant spent almost the first full four months
of her life.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in an effort to enable her to walk, Zoe, not quite 22
months old, is immobilized in a body cast that extends from just
under her arms to the tips of her still-tiny toes.
</P>
<P>
   The cast, which she will wear for two to four months, follows
surgery Nov. 17 at Cook Children's Medical Center to rebuild Zoe's
left hip socket, which never completely formed, and to fit her leg
properly in the new socket so that she can learn to crawl and walk.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, premature babies like Zoe had much slimmer
chances of surviving, let alone thriving and learning to walk. But
breakthroughs in technology and drugs have not only helped increase
the odds of survival for preemies but pushed back the age of
viability to as early as 23 weeks gestation. These very premature
infants often continue to struggle, undergoing extensive surgery,
taking medications to mature their lungs more quickly and existing
on special diets.
</P>
<P>
   Baby Zoe barely made it to 23 weeks gestation. When she was born
Feb. 23, 1997, she weighed a whopping 1 pound 3 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never seen anything like her,'' said her mother, Tina
Caldwell. ``Her head looked like a small lemon, her fingers like
pencil lead with the tiniest little fingernail at the end of each
one. Her skin was very transparent _ so thin her veins and organs
were visible.''
</P>
<P>
   Clay Caldwell, Zoe's father and a professional chef, was equally
surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor cut my wife open for the C-section and suddenly
pulled out this little purple baked potato _ that's what she looked
like,'' he says. ``I expected a pretty pink baby. I didn't know
that purple potato was my child.''
</P>
<P>
   While Clay Caldwell was collapsing in disbelief against the
anesthesiologist, his wife was praying out loud.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was imploring God to breathe the breath of life into our
baby, and suddenly the name `Zoe' just came to me,'' says Clay
Caldwell, a longtime student of theology. ``It means `the breath of
God.' ''
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Zoe's life has depended on modern medicine and
on more sublime miracles, her parents say. As soon as Zoe was born,
the neonatologist suctioned out her mouth and throat and
immediately tried to insert the smallest breathing tube available
down to her tiny, premature lungs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was saying the tube was too big and her throat was too
small, and he couldn't get it down,'' Tina Caldwell says. ``Then,
my sister, who was standing right next to the doctor, started
praying out loud.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could hear her praying, `Lord you make a way where there is
no way,' and suddenly the tube just slipped on in.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the breathing tube, Zoe wasn't given much hope _
except by her parents, who say they were totally overwhelmed and
had no choice but to turn everything over to God.
</P>
<P>
   Since her birth, Zoe has had surgeries to reinflate a collapsed
lung, to repair a ruptured small intestine and to correct her
vision. And she has been treated for a life-threatening infection.
Doctors say she has done amazingly well for a baby born on the
border of viability.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the family celebrated Zoe's first birthday with an
open house for more than 100 friends and neighbors. They designed
the invitations with a picture of Zoe lying in a big bowl of salad
greens and the words, ``Lettuce Rejoice.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, baby Zoe is ``just as fiery and determined as can be. She
knows all the neighbors and who lives where, and she loves
people,'' her mother says. Even better, beyond the treatment
involving the body cast, no additional special medical care is
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Life is at last becoming normal for Zoe and the Caldwells.
Meanwhile, father Clay, who is chief chef for Kenneth Copeland
Ministries in Fort Worth, takes full credit for the fact that Zoe's
favorite food is broccoli.
</P>
<P>
   He gives God credit for all the rest.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The spirit of universal design _ making something that enhances
everyone's life _ has filtered into my garden plans for next
spring. As I planted tulips up and down the hill in front of our
barn in Maryland over Thanksgiving, I scoured the old buildings for
good junk that might lend itself to a container garden on the south
side of the house, just outside the kitchen door.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, when a patio was still something you saw in Spain, my
grandfather poured a slab of concrete in the L-shaped space, which
was not only protected from the north wind but also operated as a
passive solar heat collector. Ever since, the cement, as we call
it, has been a natural gathering place for people, dogs, cats and
black snakes. It's often warm enough to sit out there in the
winter, provided the wind is down, and by spring, it feels like the
Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, we have lined the edge with pots of oleanders or
African lilies. Morning glories have scrambled over the kitchen
porch roof, from their humble whisky barrels on either side of the
door.
</P>
<P>
   And next spring, I'm going to add a few old washtubs on rollers
_ like the ones I've admired at the roof garden at Terence Cardinal
Cook Health Center in East Harlem _ for a little movable salad bar
next to the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Out in the garden, Bernie Eckenrode, who keeps everything from
the old Gravely tractor to the furnace going, has agreed that this
winter he will build a raised bed, about thigh-high, so that my
mother can get her fingers in the dirt without crawling around on
her hands and knees. (``Don't put me in any more stories,''
Kathleen says.)
</P>
<P>
   It will be wide enough to sit on while twiddling with the plants
and will be made of rot-resistant cedar rather than treated lumber,
because we don't want chemicals leaching into our food supply.
After the summer harvest, this same bed will be a convenient site
for the cold frame, which produces cold-hardy greens in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   I'm envisioning more trellises, too, for tomatoes, pole beans,
peas and squash. Vertical crops get more sun and air circulation,
they are less vulnerable to insects and rot, and you don't have to
bend down to pick them.
</P>
<P>
   You can make trellises out of bamboo or sapling weed trees or
buy them ready-made, and they work equally well in the ground or
with planters. I saw some great ones at the roof garden at Terence
Cardinal Cook, including vine-covered arbors, which can provide
food as well as shade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make sure you provide raised beds with a variety of heights,''
said David Kamp, the landscape architect who designed that garden.
``Somebody in a walker might find it more comfortable to stand and
plant, while someone else might want to sit. Even individual needs
change from day to day.''
</P>
<P>
   I fell in love with the spirit of universal design a few weeks
ago, at the ``Unlimited by Design'' exhibition at the Cooper-Hewitt
National Design Museum. As soon as you make something more
accessible, everyone wants it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think, `Oh, universal design, that's for people with
disabilities,' '' said Bruce Hannah, who, with Tanya Van Cott,
designed the exhibition. ``But I always say, Alexander Graham
Bell's father ran a school for the deaf. He invented a hearing aid
that works so well I can hear someone talking from California with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   He handed me a pair of featherweight rubber hedge shears,
designed by Frank Cogliano, with comfortably large handles. They
were so much lighter than I'd expected, they almost floated out of
my hand, and I longed for some boxwood to test the blades on. Who
wouldn't prefer these to the wooden-handled variety, which can
strain even the most vigorous wrists? Too bad, they're not yet in
production. I also was curious to see how much force a pair of
gear-operated loppers would bring to bear on my overgrown mock
oranges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about increasing reach and leverage,'' Hannah said,
as I picked up a trowel bent at a right angle to the handle, with
cuffs that fit around your forearm. The design takes the pressure
off the wrist and harnesses the use of the whole arm for digging.
</P>
<P>
   Haws now makes a plastic watering can with an arching handle,
far lighter than its brass ancestors. Smith &AMP; Hawken offers a
lightweight, two-wheeled cart for collecting garden clippings and
toting tools, but I wondered about the single handle. Wouldn't a
two-handled cart be more stable?
</P>
<P>
   ``My father would never use a walker,'' Gianfranco Zaccai, a
designer for the exhibition, had told me. ``But he loved to go to
the grocery store and push the cart for my mother. There was lots
to look at, it was socially acceptable, and he was doing something
to help my mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as I started thinking that's what the world needed _ a
grocery cart for the garden _ I got an e-mail from
``nick(AT)noblemotion.com.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A wheelchair is the last thing you need,'' said the electronic
Nick Thompson, replying to a comment I made last week about my
mother's aversion to wheelchairs (sorry, Mom).
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask your mother'' _ (sorry, Mom) _ ``and her friends where
they walk best. At the risk of sounding cocky, I am betting their
answer will be, `Behind a grocery cart.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson sells something called a rollator, designed in Sweden,
which looks like a walker on four wheels, with a little basket to
hold your stuff and a seat for taking a breather. (Information:
800-234-9255 or www.noblemotion.com.) It costs about $400,
depending on the model.
</P>
<P>
   But look, you don't have to spend a lot of money to bring
universal design to the tomato patch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't make disabled people special,'' said Nancy Chambers, the
director of horticulture therapy at the Rusk Institute of
Rehabilitation Medicine in Manhattan. ``All people are different,
and it's just a matter of finding the right tools.''
</P>
<P>
   She held up her hand and ordered me to place my palm against
hers. My fingers were about an inch longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``See?'' she said. ``Would we use the same tools?'' I tried out
a lightweight pair of snippers she finds ideal for light pruning.
They were simply too small for my hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you have a little arthritis in your right hand,'' she
said. ``You should be using Felco No. 7, which turns and swivels.''
</P>
<P>
   There are extenders that can be snapped onto favorite rakes and
hoes to extend reach and prevent lower back strain. There are
dozens of tools with soft grips that are easy on the hand. There
are garden stools and little seats on wheels that can roll you down
the garden bed, as you weed or plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all available,'' Ms. Chambers said. ``But you have to go
to the store and try out the tools. Or order from the catalogs. If
they don't work for you, send them back.''
</P>
<P>
   So, I leafed through my favorite catalogs. Smith &AMP; Hawken has a
whole line of tools for what it calls the ageless garden. Fiskars
(800-500-4849 for a list of retailers), known for its scissors, has
a wealth of extenders, soft grips, right-angled tools and
gear-operated pruners and loppers.
</P>
<P>
   Stillbrook Horticultural Supplies (800-414-4468) offers a Felco
No. 13 pruner, developed by occupational therapists, with an
extra-long handle for two-handed use, as well as many other
universal tools. Gardener's Supply (800-863-1700) offers everything
from bamboo trellises and raised beds to sturdy kneelers, which
creaky gardeners can use to lower themselves to the ground (or turn
upside down for a seat).
</P>
<P>
   Another great source of information is ``The Enabling Garden,''
by Gene Rothert (Taylor Publishing, 1994), a horticultural
therapist who uses a wheelchair. Rothert designed the barrier-free
garden at the Chicago Botanic Garden, and much of his practical
wisdom is in this book.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever works. Rollators, washtubs on wheels. My cousin Janice
crawled up to her garden one spring, after her hip operation, just
to plant the peas.

<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ When you enter the long nave of St. James African
Methodist Episcopal Church here, there is a deep, rich glow near
the altar, coming from windows that pulsate with color and light.
The dazzling interplay of emerald greens, dark blues, ambers and
rubies inspires a feeling verging on rapture. Anyone seeing these
six windows will wonder if they are by Louis Comfort Tiffany. The
answer is a definite ``maybe'' and, in fact, the mystery may never
be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   St. James Church stands on a hill in a blighted area of Newark.
Originally Presbyterian, it became African Methodist Episcopal in
1945. Today, the Rev. Dr. William Watley presides over the church,
which provides free meals daily and support to its community.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting this hard-working place, one feels like the person who
goes into a grandmother's attic and discovers an Old Master
painting. The fine 1850 Gothic-style building was designed by John
Welch, with extensive additions in the 1890s by Carrere &AMP; Hastings.
In the addition there is a magnificent south-facing rose window,
six feet in diameter. Five of the six stained glass windows
surrounding the altar depict religious scenes; the other one shows
a woman looking out into a garden.
</P>
<P>
   Churches in the New York area that have Tiffany windows include,
most notably, St. Michael's Episcopal Church, at 225 W. 99th St.
and, on Long Island, St. Andrew's Dune Church in Southampton, the
Church of the Atonement in Quogue, St. John's Episcopal Church in
Cold Spring Harbor (near the site where Tiffany built his country
home, Laurelton Hall) and St. Mark's Episcopal Church in Islip.
</P>
<P>
   While Tiffany windows add a spiritual and esthetic dimension to
churches, their maintenance is a huge responsibility, particularly
if the buildings pass from affluent memberships to those struggling
to meet parishioners' needs. A congregation in Brooklyn that was
selling the All Souls Universalist church in 1997 decided to lend
its two Tiffany windows to the Brooklyn Museum. (At least the
windows were not sold; Christie's valued the pair at $120,000 to
$160,000.)
</P>
<P>
   As for the St. James windows in Newark, it is not certain they
are by Tiffany. All documents relating to the building of the
church were burned, and local newspapers contain no record of its
erection. Nor are the windows listed in the 1912 inventory of
Tiffany's work. But Arthur Femenella, one of the leading Tiffany
glass consultants in the country, points out several reasons why
the Tiffany attribution is convincing.
</P>
<P>
   ``These windows were put in at a later date than the other ones
in the church,'' he said, ``probably in the 1890s, when the Carrere
&AMP; Hastings addition was being built. Thomas Hastings had worked
with Tiffany on the Seventh Regiment Armory in Manhattan, and it
seems likely he brought the artist with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Femenella said the glass is of the highest quality. ``The
studio's full arsenal of artistic weapons has been unleashed
here,'' he said. ``The drapery glass in particular bears the mark
of Tiffany. The emphasis on landscape and foliage is typical of
Tiffany. Finally, the use of copper foil in the windows was rarely
used by glass designers other than Tiffany.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lennox, the owner of Stained Glass Imagery Inc. of Staten
Island, is in charge of restoring the windows. ``Up to four or five
layers of glass have been used to give a three-dimensional
impression, like relief work,'' he said. ``The chunk glass around
the memorial plaques is very Tiffany. The rondels are like
handblown jewels.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany or not, the windows are in need of help. ``Lead in
stained glass windows should be replaced every 50 to 100 years,''
Lennox said. ``The protective plexiglass put up over the rose
window has actually been detrimental, creating a climate of
moisture between the covering and the window that has rotted the
wood and encouraged termites.'' The rose window is being removed,
then cleaned and releaded in Lennox's studio. It will be reset in
the church in March in restored wood frames.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The St. James congregation hired Annabelle Radcliffe-Trenner, a
preservation architect in Princeton, N.J., to examine the entire
building and give a diagnosis. The news was not good.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crisis management,'' Ms. Radcliffe-Trenner said. ``We are
doing emergency work simply to prevent further deterioration. Damp,
rot, removal of tar _ the list is endless. We removed 15 dead
pigeons from the roof. We should be making long-term plans, but the
cost is prohibitive.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Historic Trust gave St. James the largest loan it
has ever made, $450,000, toward the repair of the roof, the
building's stonework and the rose window. But Calvin Jackson, a
church trustee who is overseeing the restoration, said that even
that sum will not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   At lunchtime these days people crowd the dining hall for a free
meal and a prayer, to the accompaniment of the sound of hammering
on the church roof. St. James has vowed not to sell its treasures.
Instead, it continues to look after its flock under their jeweled
light.
</P>
<P>
   A HAMMER'S FALL
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Interest in Tiffany continues. Along with the Tiffany
exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum and a collection of historic
church stained glass at the American Bible Society, Christie's is
holding an auction next Thursday devoted exclusively to Tiffany
works. The prices that Christie's estimates the objects will bring
are an indication of how well Tiffany pieces have done at auction
previously.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's is offering a clematis skylight from the Harbel
mansion in Akron, Ohio, circa 1915, which it estimates will bring
$90,000 to $120,000; a brilliantly colored window showing a young
woman with auburn hair ($70,000 to $100,000), and floor and table
lamps with themes as varied as poppies, peonies and fireflies.
</P>
<P>
   A star of the auction is a magnolia leaded-glass and gilt bronze
floor lamp, circa 1913. A similar one brought a record $993,500 in
June. Also at auction is a mantel clock covered in mosaics with a
band of linked peacock ``eyes'' ($28,000 to $36,000). Viewing
begins Saturday at Christie's. The auction is scheduled for 2 p.m.
next Thursday. The catalog is $35 from (800) 395-6300.

   (italics)These five kinds of sports gear use Advanced Control
Experts' piezoceramic vibration-control module, which has
piezoceramic plates that convert mechanical vibrations to
electrical impulses.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   K2 SKIS, $565-$795 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   K2 Skis introduced the first piezo-enhanced sports product in
November 1995 and has expanded its piezo-enhanced lineup to
approximately one-third of its products. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   K2 BIKE, MOUNTAIN BICYCLES, $800-$4,000 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   First released in October 1997, the K2 mountain bicycle ``smart
shock'' uses the piezoceramic module somewhat differently than
other piezo sports products. Instead of converting mechanical
impulses to electrical impulses and dissipating the energy, the
shock uses an electronic sensor to monitor the need for ``harder''
or ``softer'' shocks.
</P>
<P>
   The sensor signals the piezoceramic, which then lets more or
less oil through the shock mechanism. This year's models use a
Motorola microprocessor within the shock. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   K2 SNOWBOARD, $500 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Electra, released in June 1997, uses two piezoelectric
vibration dampers, one on each edge of the board between the foot
and the tip of the board. Advanced Control Experts says tests show
an 80 percent drop in destabilizing vibrations. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WORTH INC., COPPERHEAD ACX BASEBALL BAT, $279-$299 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The company says the Copperhead ACX, released in May, reduces
vibrations _ and the sting that accompanies them _ by 50 percent to
70 percent. The ACX piezoelectric module is embedded in the handle.
It enlarges the spot where the batter will achieve maximum speed on
the ball, so batters hit better with less sting. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   O'BRIEN INTERNATIONAL WATER SKIS, $589 and $539 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tested by Andy Mapple, a champion water skier, in this year's
World Cup Championship, O'Brien's piezo water skis came out in
September. They reduce ``chatter,'' for better turns and control.

IMAGES OF THE GREAT DEPRESSION, NOW AVAILABLE ON THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ During the Great Depression, the federal government
hired a corps of photographers to capture the searing poverty of
beleaguered farmers and other workers and, not incidentally, to
provide work for unemployed photographers. Now these pictures, some
of the most memorable photographs of that era, have been made
available over the Internet without fees to anyone with a computer.
</P>
<P>
   One of those great photographers couldn't be more pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important because otherwise an important part of
history is sitting dead in files,'' said that photographer, Gordon
Parks, who went on from a $48-a-week government photographer to a
long career that has also brought him acclaim as a movie director.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet project includes such well-known pictures as Parks'
image of a black charwoman holding a broom and a mop in front of an
American flag, in ironic homage in segregated Washington to Grant
Wood's ``American Gothic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be profitable to many people,'' Parks said. ``The
photographs are indictments of what the government was doing
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The Library of Congress has put online 52,000 black-and-white
pictures, plus 1,600 in color. They are from the collections of the
Farm Security Administration and a successor agency, the Office of
War Information, selected from 164,000 photographs taken from 1935
to 1945. Eventually, all the pictures in the collection, ``America
From the Great Depression to World War II,'' will be put on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site for the photos is
http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/fsahtml/fahome.html
</P>
<P>
   Besides Parks, who has 227 pictures on the Web site, others
include Walker Evans, who is represented with 517 photographs,
including the simply titled ``Sharecropper's grave'' from 1936.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothea Lange has 759 images, one of which is bound to be among
those most often downloaded _ ``Migrant Mother: Destitute Pea
Pickers in California,'' a 1936 photograph of a defeated woman with
two children, their backs to the camera, burying their faces on her
shoulders as she stares ahead. It is a picture of complete defeat
and hopelessness. It is No. 542 in Lange's Internet canon.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Mydans has 1,116 photographs available, including one of
junk piled up behind two houses in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   There are 1,430 photos by Ben Shahn, some showing people trying
to eke out livings as as cotton pickers, miners and masons. An
itinerant street photographer stands in front of a restaurant in
Columbus, Ohio, in August 1938, his eyes asking that the passerby
pose and buy the photograph from him.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Brannan, a curator of photography at the Library of
Congress, said that the Internet program had its roots in a
preservation project that started seven years ago in which new
positive prints and digital versions were made from the library's
negative collection. Last June, the library started putting
together the collection for its Internet site and it began becoming
available to the public in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is part of a preservation project for the negatives and at
the same time makes it more accessible,'' Ms. Brannan said.
</P>
<P>
   Parks and any of the other photographers still alive will not
make any money from the wide distribution of their pictures because
the pictures are government property, made while the photographers
were working for the federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The going rate for photographers during the Depression, Ms.
Brannan said, was about $2,300 a year, or $44 a week. Parks got an
extra $4 a week because he was regarded as a senior photographer.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Fleischauer, technical coordinator for the project, said
that the resolution of the pictures on the Internet was similar to
that found in daily newspapers but not as clear as that in
magazines. In any event, quality will also depend on the computer
and printer used by the person who takes the pictures off the Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how good the computer and printer, the Internet
pictures are still not near the quality of the photographic prints.
These can be ordered from the Library of Congress for $18 and up,
Ms. Brannan said. Instructions for ordering are on the Web site.

FOSSIL OF 90-MILLION-YEAR-OLD FISH FOUND IN TEXAS LANDFILL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DIANE SMITH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Mountains of waste will soon be heaped into the
newest trash pit at Hunter Ferrell Landfill, but for now, the hole
is home to a prehistoric prize.
</P>
<P>
   Nestled 60 feet under the landfill are fossilized pieces of an
8- to 12-foot-long xiphactinus, a menacing fish with razor-sharp
teeth and powerful jaws, that roamed waterways 90 million years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The fish's fin, jaw, teeth and a string of vertebrae were
discovered Monday by workers who were digging a pit at the
landfill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really don't ever expect to find interesting treasures when
we're digging the holes. It's always when we are filling it,'' said
Mary Nix, disposal manager for the Irving Department of Public
Health and Environmental Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I called `a dino-fish,' '' Nix said. ``It's
big.''
</P>
<P>
   After being excavated, portions of the fossil were taken to
Southern Methodist University in Dallas, where the fish was
identified by Louis Jacobs, a professor of geological sciences.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I heard is that because of the rain, they had moved to
another area to dig, and that's the only reason they saw it,''
Jacobs said. ``If they hadn't been digging there, it would have
never been found. It would have been forever under the trash pit.''
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the fossil were taken to the Dallas Museum of Natural
History Tuesday afternoon for further study. Museum officials said
they hope to continue the dig.
</P>
<P>
   Herminio Beltran, a 21-year-old employee with the L.D. Kemp
excavation company, unearthed the fossil while operating an
excavator.
</P>
<P>
   Beltran said that he often looks for fossils when digging and
that he wasn't surprised by the find.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found the head first,'' he said. ``It was different than the
rock. It looked black.''
</P>
<P>
   Excitement about the find spread quickly among area experts in
geology and paleontology, the study of fossils.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have one that good here'' at SMU, Jacobs said. ``It's
just a beautiful specimen. The head is out, but all the pieces are
there, and it can be prepared beautifully.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Fiorillo, curator of paleontology at the Dallas museum,
said the find will complement a less-than-perfect xiphactinus on
display in the museum's Oryx Hall, which showcases Texas dinosaurs
and prehistoric turtles, fish and other animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty of the specimen is how much of it is there,''
Fiorillo said.
</P>
<P>
   The remains of the carnivorous fish were found in shale from the
Eagleford Formation, dating to the Cretaceous Period. At the time
this type of fish traveled the oceans, dinosaurs roamed the land.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Head, a graduate student in paleontology at SMU, said the
xiphactinus was an ancestor of the tarpon, an ocean game fish. But
this fish, which averaged 15 feet in length, had an appetite for
other creatures of the sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a large predatory fish,'' Head said, noting that a
xiphactinus specimen in Kansas was found with a fish in its
stomach.
</P>
<P>
   The stomach of the Irving Xiphactinus has not been found, but
experts said they hope the fish died shortly after eating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they find another fish in its belly,'' Jacobs said.

   NEW YORK _ The call came in from the White House on Nov. 10.
Could Colette Peters, fantasy cake decorator to Bette Midler,
Whoopi Goldberg, Al Pacino, Joan Rivers and Rockefeller Center,
make edible Christmas decorations for the mantels in the Red Room
and the Green Room and for the Grand Foyer? And could she have them
installed by Saturday night, Dec. 5?
</P>
<P>
   Not too many people say no to the White House. Neither did Ms.
Peters, who gave up a career as a painter _ that thing about making
a living _ to bake and decorate cakes for the rich and famous. The
cakes turned out to provide a very nice living.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for the holiday request, which came through Robert
Isabell, the New York party designer and florist who is also doing
some White House decorations, Ms. Peters cleared her shop on
Washington Street in the West Village and set to work with the
tools of a painter and sculptor. This week, her workroom looked
like a set for ``The Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy'': any visitor
standing still risked being coated with rolled fondant and
decorated with nonpareils.
</P>
<P>
   With royal icing, gum paste, fondant, pastillage, silver and
gold dragees, Karo syrup, lemon extract and plastic-foam base she
has created an edible Christmas tree decorated with elegantly
wrapped packages for the foyer, a lacy ice palace and ice garden to
sit on the mantel in the Green Room under a portrait of Benjamin
Franklin, and for the Red Room, a whimsical tableau of polar bears,
igloos and snowflakes.
</P>
<P>
   It is the painstaking details that make Ms. Peters' work so
unusual _ closer to sculpture than to cake decoration. The
snowflakes look like tracery. The white wrapping paper and silver
and gold ribbons for the packages on the tree are all patterned
icing.
</P>
<P>
   After studying at the Pratt Institute and the Rhode Island
School of Design, Ms. Peters decided to give up the life of an
artist for the life of a designer at Tiffany's, where she also did
all the cakes for John Loring's Tiffany books. Twenty years ago,
she went into cake decorating full time. Last year, Tiffany's asked
her to do its Christmas windows.
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of work she likes best, leaving the baking to
her assistants. ``If I never had to bake a cake again, I'd be
happy,'' she said. ``I'd rather spend the time decorating.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she did not put a price tag on her White House
creations, she estimated that it would cost her at least $2,000 in
supplies and trips to and from Washington for herself and her
staff. And in order to take on the White House project, Ms. Peters
has had to turn away about $10,000 in commissions.
</P>
<P>
   The minimum price for a Colette Peters cake is $250; most cost
$1,000. The six-foot cake for the wedding of Marie-Chantal Miller
to Crown Prince Pavlos of Greece in 1995 was ``more than $25,000,
but less than $100,000,'' Ms. Peters said. It was decorated with
the same flowers that are used on Flora Danica, the pricey Swedish
china originally made for the prince's royal Swedish relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Since each of the 1,500 guests at the wedding had an individual
cake, the main cake remained untouched. So Ms. Peters brought it
back to New York and, from time to time, scavenged flower
decorations from it.
</P>
<P>
   Barbra Streisand's wedding cake, from a Los Angeles bakery,
looked exactly like her design for the prince, Ms. Peters says, and
others have lifted ideas from her books. If imitation is the
sincerest form of flattery Ms. Peters must be flattered to death.
But credit, she said, would be even better.
</P>
<P>
   Which is all she will be getting at the White House. Still, ``I
didn't think a minute about accepting the job,'' she said, adding:
``It's a great honor. And it's a chance to do something of my own
design.''
</P>
<P>
   Glimpses of Ms. Peters' designs can be had during public tours
of the state rooms, starting Monday and continuing through Dec. 31.
What with 4-year-olds who cannot resist snacking and grown-ups who
cannot resist touching, the icing, gum paste, pastillage and
fondant will not be recycled.

   LONDON _ There is a ``substantial risk'' that the world will
plunge into recession next year, according to a gloomy new forecast
from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The sister organization to the International Monetary Fund warns
that sharp stock market falls in the U.S. and Europe, or a
continuing pause in international capital flows, could bring global
growth to a halt in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Even taking a more optimistic outlook, the developing countries
face their worst growth prospects since the Third World debt crisis
nearly 20 years ago, it says.
</P>
<P>
   Controversially, the new report also recommends that some
developing countries should restrict or tax ``hot money'' capital
flows to safeguard against future crises.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Stiglitz, the World Bank's chief economist, concludes
that the recent crises reveal fundamental weaknesses in the
international financial system.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a single car has an accident on a bend in the highway,
one might infer something about the driver or his car. But when, at
the same bend, there are accidents day in and day out, the
presumption changes _ there is probably something wrong with the
road,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   The bank welcomes the recent U.S. interest rate cuts and
Japanese fiscal package but calls for further measures to avert a
deep global slump.
</P>
<P>
   The risk of a worsening recession in Japan and slower growth in
the U.S. and Europe if share prices suffer a sharp correction make
prospects for 1999 precarious, the report warns.
</P>
<P>
   It forecasts that global growth will nearly halve from 3.2
percent in 1997 to 1.8 percent in 1999, and puts a high probability
on zero growth next year. The crisis-ridden Asian economies are
likely to have seen an 8 percent drop in GDP this year, with no
growth in prospect next year.
</P>
<P>
   Developing countries will be hit hardest. Brazil, Indonesia,
Russia and other countries, accounting for a quarter of world
demand, have suffered a decline in GDP per head this year.
</P>
<P>
   The report argues for an expansion in demand, a better social
safety net, and injections of public funds for banking reform in
the crisis countries.
</P>
<P>
   It estimates that the cost will amount to 20 to 30 percent of
their GDP. ``Continuing financial support from the international
community is vital,'' it says.
</P>
<P>
   The report comes out in favor of restrictions on the more
volatile short-term capital flows in future to reduce the risk of
repeat crises. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The Puget Sound, a stretch of water that cuts inland
from the northwest Pacific coast of the United States, is Boeing
country. From Everett in the north, on through Boeing Fields and
downtown Seattle, to Renton at the southern tip of the Puget, the
familiar logo of the world's biggest aircraft manufacturer
dominates the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Seattle has other household names and other big employers
_ Microsoft and Starbucks, the coffee people, come to mind. But
when Boeing sneezes, the Puget shakes.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, it was still reverberating from Boeing's stunning
announcement that it intends to shed 48,000 employees _ a fifth of
its work force _ over the next two years and cut back production
savagely.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has caught a bad dose of the Asian flu and its work force
is paying the price for the collapse in air travel and hence demand
for passenger jets in the Pacific Rim.
</P>
<P>
   But the effects will be felt not just in Puget Sound. Boeing is
a big spender in the U.K. as well, where it buys (pounds sterling)
1.4 billion-worth of supplies a year from 200 component firms
including Rolls-Royce, British Aerospace, GEC Marconi and Smiths
Industries.
</P>
<P>
   Across Europe, some 90,000 direct and indirect jobs are said to
depend on Boeing orders.
</P>
<P>
   Half of those job cuts were already in the pipeline.
Nevertheless, the scale of the additional reductions, coupled with
a warning that profits would be $500 million lower next year than
forecast, caught the aerospace industry and Wall Street on the hop.
</P>
<P>
   Production of Boeing's entire model range, with the exception of
the new 100-seater 717, will be cut back. Output of the 747 Jumbo
jet, Boeing's biggest profit earner, will fall from 3.5 a month now
to two in 1999 and just one a month the year after.
</P>
<P>
   Production of the New Generation 737, the workhorse of most
airline fleets, is also being trimmed back by more than 10 percent,
while the 757 and 767 lines will slow down.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian downturn has not yet materialized in cancelled,
delayed or deferred orders. In fact Boeing has lost just three
orders in the region so far _ and that followed the collapse of
Philippines Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide deliveries this year are on target to reach 550 and
are forecast to increase to 620 next year. Boeing expects to
deliver all 84 aircraft on order from Asian airlines in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond that, the market falls off a cliff. Harry
Stonecipher, Boeing's chief operating officer, said Wednesday:
``Options are not being exercised and there is zero market growth.
It is not a pretty picture, nor is it improving. We think this
situation will take between two and five years to work through.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 475. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Not everyone in the aviation industry is convinced by Boeing's
explanation. Over the last decade, the work force at Seattle has
gone up and down like a fiddler's elbow _ more because of Boeing's
inability to match production capacity to customer demand than
because of any collapse in the market.
</P>
<P>
   The last big jobs cull took place in the early 1990s when the
work force was trimmed by 20 percent. But just as Seattle was
recovering from that, Boeing unveiled a hugely ambitious program to
double production and, until last year, it was taking on workers at
the rate of 1,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Then Boeing hit the buffers in late 1997 when it had to cut back
production of the New Generation 737 because of acute bottlenecks
on its assembly lines. The resulting financial mayhem and penalty
payments to airlines drove the company into its first loss in five
decades.
</P>
<P>
   A rival aerospace executive said: ``When I heard the news from
Seattle I could not believe it. Boeing is blaming the Asian crisis
for its troubles but the reality is that it has been too greedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug McVitie, managing director of the Arran Aerospace aviation
consultancy, agrees: ``I'm not sure all of this can go down to the
situation in Asia. They overstretched themselves and left very
little margin for error.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's problems are compounded by the fact that it is losing
market share to its European rival Airbus Industrie, in which
British Aerospace has a 20 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   This year the Toulouse-based consortium has scooped half the
market for new orders, which explains its air of confidence and
rapidly growing production lines. Airbus has increased production
by 25 percent this year to 230 aircraft and expects to raise output
to 290 aircraft in 1999 and 320 the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Airbus forecasts that the world's airlines will require
13,600 new aircraft of 70 seats or more over the next 20 years,
worth a total of $1,200 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian market is important. It accounts for 20 percent of
world airline traffic and is forecast to grow at a faster rate than
any other part of the world except for China in the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   But Adam Brown, vice-president of forecasting and strategic
planning at Airbus, thinks the impact of the Asian crisis has been
overdone. He estimates that the areas of Asia that are in decline
represent only 7 percent of the world airline market.
</P>
<P>
   ``If air travel in all these areas were to come to a complete
standstill for a year, total world air traffic would show hardly
any decline at all. Also, despite the severe short-term problems
facing the Asian airlines, the fundamentals underlying the region's
great potential for sustained long-term economic growth remain
unchanged.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be some months before Boeing's U.K. suppliers feel the
full backdraft from the cutbacks in Seattle. Meanwhile, at least
there is the consultation of knowing that Boeing's loss is Airbus
Industrie's gain. &QL;

its work force _ over the next two years and cut back production
savagely.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has caught a bad dose of the Asian flu and its work force
is paying the price for the collapse in air travel and hence demand
for passenger jets in the Pacific Rim.
</P>
<P>
   But the effects will be felt not just in Puget Sound. Boeing is
a big spender in the U.K. as well, where it buys (pounds sterling)
1.4 billion-worth of supplies a year from 200 component firms
including Rolls-Royce, British Aerospace, GEC Marconi and Smiths
Industries.
</P>
<P>
   Across Europe, some 90,000 direct and indirect jobs are said to
depend on Boeing orders.
</P>
<P>
   Half of those job cuts were already in the pipeline.
Nevertheless, the scale of the additional reductions, coupled with
a warning that profits would be $500 million lower next year than
forecast, caught the aerospace industry and Wall Street on the hop.
</P>
<P>
   Production of Boeing's entire model range, with the exception of
the new 100-seater 717, will be cut back. Output of the 747 Jumbo
jet, Boeing's biggest profit earner, will fall from 3.5 a month now
to two in 1999 and just one a month the year after.
</P>
<P>
   Production of the New Generation 737, the workhorse of most
airline fleets, is also being trimmed back by more than 10 percent,
while the 757 and 767 lines will slow down.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian downturn has not yet materialized in cancelled,
delayed or deferred orders. In fact Boeing has lost just three
orders in the region so far _ and that followed the collapse of
Philippines Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide deliveries this year are on target to reach 550 and
are forecast to increase to 620 next year. Boeing expects to
deliver all 84 aircraft on order from Asian airlines in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond that, the market falls off a cliff. Harry
Stonecipher, Boeing's chief operating officer, said Wednesday:
``Options are not being exercised and there is zero market growth.
It is not a pretty picture, nor is it improving. We think this
situation will take between two and five years to work through.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 475. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Not everyone in the aviation industry is convinced by Boeing's
explanation. Over the last decade, the work force at Seattle has
gone up and down like a fiddler's elbow _ more because of Boeing's
inability to match production capacity to customer demand than
because of any collapse in the market.
</P>
<P>
   The last big jobs cull took place in the early 1990s when the
work force was trimmed by 20 percent. But just as Seattle was
recovering from that, Boeing unveiled a hugely ambitious program to
double production and, until last year, it was taking on workers at
the rate of 1,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Then Boeing hit the buffers in late 1997 when it had to cut back
production of the New Generation 737 because of acute bottlenecks
on its assembly lines. The resulting financial mayhem and penalty
payments to airlines drove the company into its first loss in five
decades.
</P>
<P>
   A rival aerospace executive said: ``When I heard the news from
Seattle I could not believe it. Boeing is blaming the Asian crisis
for its troubles but the reality is that it has been too greedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug McVitie, managing director of the Arran Aerospace aviation
consultancy, agrees: ``I'm not sure all of this can go down to the
situation in Asia. They overstretched themselves and left very
little margin for error.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's problems are compounded by the fact that it is losing
market share to its European rival Airbus Industrie, in which
British Aerospace has a 20 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   This year the Toulouse-based consortium has scooped half the
market for new orders, which explains its air of confidence and
rapidly growing production lines. Airbus has increased production
by 25 percent this year to 230 aircraft and expects to raise output
to 290 aircraft in 1999 and 320 the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Airbus forecasts that the world's airlines will require
13,600 new aircraft of 70 seats or more over the next 20 years,
worth a total of $1,200 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian market is important. It accounts for 20 percent of
world airline traffic and is forecast to grow at a faster rate than
any other part of the world except for China in the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   But Adam Brown, vice-president of forecasting and strategic
planning at Airbus, thinks the impact of the Asian crisis has been
overdone. He estimates that the areas of Asia that are in decline
represent only 7 percent of the world airline market.
</P>
<P>
   ``If air travel in all these areas were to come to a complete
standstill for a year, total world air traffic would show hardly
any decline at all. Also, despite the severe short-term problems
facing the Asian airlines, the fundamentals underlying the region's
great potential for sustained long-term economic growth remain
unchanged.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be some months before Boeing's U.K. suppliers feel the
full backdraft from the cutbacks in Seattle. Meanwhile, at least
there is the consultation of knowing that Boeing's loss is Airbus
Industrie's gain. &QL;

DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS SEEK THE SAME ENDS THROUGH DIFFERENT MEANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Dec. 6)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients) ,
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If strangers from another planet studied the policy
declarations of Democrats and Republicans running for president in
2000, they might wonder what, if any, the differences are between
America's major political parties.
</P>
<P>
   What issues, they might ask, split the two most dramatically?
</P>
<P>
   Both parties' hopefuls speak confidently of reforming education.
They promise to save Social Security and Medicare. They talk about
cutting taxes, pledge protection of the environment, vow to fight
crime and strengthen our national defense.
</P>
<P>
   None of them so far have suggested huge federal programs of the
kind created during the presidencies of Franklin D. Roosevelt and
Lyndon B. Johnson. Few, if any, indicate a preference for the
discredited isolationist, protectionist policies of the past.
</P>
<P>
   The would-be presidents generally agree about the areas where
action should be taken to strengthen America and move it
confidently into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   So how does Al Gore differ from George W. Bush or Dick Gephardt
from Dan Quayle or Bob Kerrey from Lamar Alexander or Bill Bradley
from Steve Forbes?
</P>
<P>
   The answer lies in the details of the initiatives they offer and
the priorities they assign to those initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Take education, for example. Both parties recognize that
schools, especially those in the central city, need improvement.
But how can improvement be achieved?
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats would channel more billions into recruiting
additional teachers, building classrooms and rejuvenating the
public school system.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans also talk of constructing classrooms and adding
teachers, but they focus most on the voucher system, which provides
students from poor areas with money to enroll in upscale private
and parochial schools in affluent neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats claim that in channeling money away from public
schools and into private institutions, the government would destroy
the public school system, which is one of the treasures of our
republic.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats seriously question whether the voucher plan, which
may violate our historic devotion to the separation of church and
state, is constitutional. They also question whether the money
provided by vouchers would be adequate to support poor children in
schools with hefty tuition requirements.
</P>
<P>
   And what, they ask, would be the fate of those children left
behind in substandard public schools?
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans assert that Democratic opposition to the voucher
system is motivated by the fact that a majority of members of the
National Education Association and other teachers' unions are
staunch supporters of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   They argue that the voucher plan provides parents with a needed
choice of where their children should be educated and makes schools
competitive with one another.
</P>
<P>
   So the issue before voters is not whether one party or the other
would try to make education better. The question is how it should
be done.
</P>
<P>
   Times and politics are changing.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the Democratic Party has been able to count on
strong backing from women, African Americans, Hispanics, gays and
the underprivileged. But in last month's election, Republicans
George W. Bush in Texas and Jeb Bush in Florida were elected to
governorships with sizable support from Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
   A similar situation confronts the GOP. In previous elections,
they have been able to count on a tremendous turnout of members of
the religious right, who oppose abortion, want to mandate prayer in
public classrooms and favor such other things as term limits for
members of Congress and reduced federal spending.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, however, the religious right split its vote far more
than it has in recent years. That is one reason Republicans lost
seats in the House and failed to gain any in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   On Social Security, Democrats tend to adhere to Bill Clinton's
pledge to ``save Social Security first'' with funds from America's
first federal budget surplus in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential candidates do not question the need to
save Social Security and Medicare. But their priorities include
returning sizable portions of surpluses to voters in the form of
tax cuts. They also would move toward privatizing Social Security
by encouraging investment in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Accepting the GOP presidential nomination in 1960, Richard Nixon
sought to move to a new political plateau, far removed from the
bitter, red-baiting demagoguery of his past.
</P>
<P>
   He contended therefore that Democrats, who had just nominated
John F. Kennedy for president, and Republicans sought similar ends
but through different means. The means he advocated were, of
course, those of the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   If Nixon returned to earth today, he would recognize that the
battle between the two parties still is less over the ends desired
by Democrats and Republicans than the means to attain those ends.

EXPANSION PLAN FOR FORT WORTH MUSEUM IS BIG-LEAGUE STEP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JANET TYSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ I've always respected the Amon Carter
Museum. Its collections are great. Its staff is sophisticated,
utterly professional and devoted to its mission. The goals are
lofty. The programs are first-class.
</P>
<P>
   But, greedy me, I've always wanted more. I want to walk into the
Amon Carter and experience the sort of thrill that comes from
simply being in the Kimbell Art Museum.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, I've wanted to get excited about the Carter as a
place _ and that means getting excited about its architecture.
</P>
<P>
   And now I'll have my chance, thanks to Philip Johnson's new plan
for the museum. Adopted by museum trustees last week, it more than
triples the space for showing art, by far the Carter's most crucial
need. But it also has the potential to give the Carter a shot of
architectural charisma.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson designed the original 1961 structure, with its splendid
view and its shell-stone walls, as a memorial to museum founder
Amon G. Carter Sr. Johnson also designed the two additions.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Johnson said recently, none of those structures was
designed as a museum, which may be why experiencing the Carter can
be confusing. Elation over the superb artworks turns to anxiety as
the exhibition spaces that start out so grandly in the main gallery
become jumbled and cramped in the mezzanine galleries.
</P>
<P>
   That's about to change, however. Because finally, Carter
officials have commissioned Johnson and his partner, Alan Ritchie,
to design them a museum _ one that will crystallize, in the form of
a new building, all of the Carter's keenly focused sense of
identity as a major repository of American paintings, sculpture,
photographs and other works on paper.
</P>
<P>
   For, although the Carter memorial collection comprised works by
Remington and Russell _ works that remain central to the museum's
identity _ it has grown far beyond that. The museum owns key
paintings by 19th-century artists such as Thomas Cole and Martin
Johnson Heade; paintings and sculptures by early modernists such as
Georgia O'Keeffe, Elie Nadelman, Charles Demuth and Stuart Davis;
and photographs by giants including Robert Frank and Paul
Outerbridge, as well as by gifted anonymous photographers. The
collection has grown from 400 to almost 300,000 artworks.
</P>
<P>
   What the plan calls for is radical: nothing less than
demolishing and rebuilding two-thirds of the structure. All that
would remain of the current museum is the initial memorial.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of doing away with so much space that simply doesn't
work is exhilarating in itself. But Johnson's plan _ and no
construction timetable has been announced _ is outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, there's all that exhibition space: more than
27,000 square feet. The plan also calls for a 170-seat auditorium,
a paper-conservation lab, improved library and research facilities,
a larger retail space and an additional public entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the original entrance will bring visitors into a
space once again dedicated to Amon G. Carter Sr.'s collection and
other works representing the 19th-century American frontier. Apart
from introducing visitors to the museum's origins, this space will
become an entry into the larger museum via an atrium _ canopied to
admit natural light _ that will also link it to the new south
entrance.
</P>
<P>
   The new structure's second floor will house galleries for the
permanent collection of paintings and sculpture, space for showing
works on paper, and 4,000 square feet devoted to the photography
collection. More than 5,000 square feet will be reserved for major
traveling shows.
</P>
<P>
   This plan catapults the Carter into a new league
architecturally: It will go from being a decent building by an
important architect to a major statement about Philip Johnson. The
plan says that Johnson is a creator of witty, memorable
architectural statements and a sober, bread-and-butter
problem-solver. And it synthesizes both identities in one building.
</P>
<P>
   His new, chunky museum building becomes a simple but obviously
fine setting for his Carter memorial _ underscoring its stylized,
classical design as a rare architectural gem representing a
significant period in his restless career. Clad in a luscious brown
Arabian granite that contrasts beautifully with the shell stone of
the '61 building, it will make us look at and consider that
original structure as much more than the showy front end for a
couple of make-do additions.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, I see this plan as a vindication of Johnson's career: It
gives both the Carter and the architect's reputation a new lease on
life.

SAPLINGS FROM FAMOUS TREES ARE AVAILABLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GAILE ROBINSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The tree is the most profound sight at the Alamo.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has been to Texas' most famous historical attraction
in the last half of this century knows immediately which tree: the
enormous, undulating live oak that dominates the courtyard.
</P>
<P>
   The Alamo tree is for sale; so are Austin's Treaty Oak and the
Hanging Oak of Goliad. Cuttings and seedlings from many of
America's most famous trees are being sold by American Forests, the
oldest nonprofit conservation organization in the United States,
through its Historic &AMP; Famous Trees program.
</P>
<P>
   There are offspring of the Civil War battlefields _ Pickett's
Charge Black Walnut from Gettysburg, and the Antietam Sycamore.
There are apple trees that are believed to have been planted by
John Chapman, the arboreal enthusiast better known as Johnny
Appleseed.
</P>
<P>
   Look on the back of a $20 bill (not the new, big-headed Andy
version, but the old one, still in circulation) and to the left of
the White House, you'll see a large magnolia. President Andrew
Jackson brought it from the Hermitage in 1829 in memory of his
wife, Rachel. It is the oldest tree on the White House lawn, and
it, too, has been propagated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We identify trees that are significant to our history,'' says
Jeff Meyer, the project's organizer. For more than 100 years, the
organization has cataloged the trees; several years ago, the
growing program was instituted. And now, people can grow a part of
American history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowhere is the response more enthusiastic than Texas,'' Meyer
says.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder. Texans have many trees from which to choose,
such as Sam Houston's kissing tree. ``It's quite significant to
Texas history,'' Meyer says. ``In 1857, several people in San
Marcos were at the train station waiting for the arrival of Sam
Houston, who was running for governor. Mary Elizabeth Davis had
made a flag to present to Houston, and upon receiving it, he kissed
her. The old oak has become known as the Sam Houston kissing bur
oak. It has seeds as big as baseballs.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyer has grown offspring of other, less famous Texas trees,
such as the Ben Milam bald cypress, the tree that held a Mexican
sniper during the Texas Revolution in December 1835; the Trinity
River Bur Oak, a tree that marked a favorite camping spot of the
Caddo Indians; and the Masonic Live Oak. It was under the latter
tree that Anson Jones, first grand master of Texas Masonic Lodges,
assembled his organization in Brazoria County in 1834.
</P>
<P>
   Sycamore seeds have traveled the farthest to be included in the
program. Astronaut Stuart Roosa, a member of Apollo 14 and a former
fire jumper in the forest service, took seeds into space. Those
seeds have grown into Moon Sycamores.
</P>
<P>
   The Goose Island Live Oak, though, is by far the tree with the
strangest tale to tell. It is one of the nation's largest and
oldest trees, estimated to be more than 1,000 years old. Legend has
it that the tree grows where cannibalistic Karankawas held pagan
ceremonies, devouring their enemies. Early visitors to the area,
near Rockport, may have included explorers Alvar Nunez Cabeza de
Vaca in 1528 and Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, in 1864.
</P>
<P>
   It costs $35 to own a tree that has been to the moon or a
sapling to remember the Alamo. American Forests will ship a
year-old sapling and a 4-foot high greenhouse. The tree should be
planted and supported with a wooden stake; the greenhouse protects
it during its first year in new soil. Buyers get a personalized
history of the tree, fertilizer and a lifetime guarantee. ``We want
people to be successful,'' says Meyer, who takes a very
paternalistic view of the trees. For more information, call (800)
320-8733.

<P>
   In the golden age of five-and-dimes, there was a special place
mainly for girls. Tucked on a rack between the comic books and the
coloring books were folders of paper dolls. The nice ones might be
29 cents or 59 cents, the cheap ones 15 cents.
</P>
<P>
   For some girls (and more than a few boys), playing with the
mix-and-match outfits was almost an afterthought; there was a
satisfaction simply in cutting out the clothes and the little white
tabs that held them in place.
</P>
<P>
   Today, five-and-dimes aren't what they used to be, and neither
are paper dolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not the variety out there that there was years ago,''
said Jim Faraone, the editor and publisher of Paper Doll Pal, a
newsletter for creators and collectors. ``If it's not a Disney
movie or a Barbie doll, there's not much coming out.''
</P>
<P>
   For some enthusiasts, the Internet is replacing those
inexpensive paper folders. Many paper-doll artists are putting
samples of their work on line, where they can be downloaded free
and reproduced on black-and-white or color printers. Some more
elaborate Web sites provide visitors to pick from a variety of
online outfits and dress dolls the way they choose.
</P>
<P>
   A good place to start is the home page of the Original Paper
Doll Artists Guild (www.opdag.com), an organization of doll fans
that prints a quarterly newsletter for members and has links to
many doll pages.
</P>
<P>
   One such site, Marilee's Paperdoll Page
(www.ameritech.net/users/macler/paperdolls.html) includes links for
a wide variety of paper dolls _ teen-age dolls, animals and toys,
historical figures and celebrity dolls _ along with her own
printable dolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get letters from people who have printed a copy of every
paper doll linked to my site, just as a collection,'' Marilee wrote
via e-mail. (Marilee, who lives in a Chicago suburb, declined to
disclose her last name.) ``Some teachers have written saying they
used the paper dolls in the classroom to teach computer skills. A
Canadian art teacher was coordinating classrooms in different parts
of the world. They looked at my site for ideas, made their own
paper dolls using photos of their faces, then traded with some
other school somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Paper dolls have been around since 18th-century France. Some
current doll artists, like C. David Claudon
(www.tezcat.com/videoc/PaperDolls.html), design elaborate costumes
in medieval, French court and stage styles. Rather than coloring
his black-and-white originals, Claudon scanned them into the
computer and colored them on line. ``Learning to paint with the
computer added a whole new dimension,'' Claudon said in an e-mail
interview, `` and I really like the freedom it offers.''
</P>
<P>
   There are more familiar doll names on line, too, like the
Berenstain Bears (www.berenstainbears. com/dressup.html). The
Archie Comics site has a page for fans of Katy Keene
(www.archiecomics. com/katy), the fashion queen whose comic book,
bearing a host of paper dolls, appeared regularly from 1949 to 1961
and again from 1983 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Sneathen Mattox, a well-known paper doll artist from
Indiana (photon.indy.net/paperdoll/bsmdoll.html), displays only a
few of her doll designs on line and sells the complete sets. She
said via e-mail that for paper-doll artists, the Internet ``enables
us to get our work in front of people who might not otherwise see
it, especially kids who barely know what a paper doll is!''
</P>
<P>
   In the paper doll world, Kiss means not the rock group, but
kisaeke (Japanese for ``changing clothes''), a form of Japanese
doll cartoons. They are highly imaginative dolls, but parents
should take note: in Japan, dolls and paper doll mannequins often
start off nude. Not Barbie nude, but nude nude.
</P>
<P>
   Kiss sites should be checked out by parents first. G-rated Kiss
offerings are usually available through a Kids Domain site
(www.kidsdomain.com/down/kiss), which is down for a week or two for
maintenance.

HIGH-TECH GEAR OFFERS VISIONS OF THE NIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By PHIL PATTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rarely has an urban legend been born so quickly and openly as
the tale that Sony's NightShot video camera could see through
clothes. Jay Leno joked about it: ``Hear about this new video
camera that looks through clothes? Well, Sony has recalled it _ and
raised the price.'' The government of Malaysia banned the device
with its No Lux infrared feature.
</P>
<P>
   The titillating tale rippled through the news media like
snickers through a sophomore science class. It had only the tiniest
grain of truth: in skilled hands, during the day, under just the
right conditions, with just the right (gauzy) fabrics, it might be
possible to produce an image of a body beneath. The camera could
not, of course, see through clothes, and there was no recall.
</P>
<P>
   Sony was only slightly embarrassed; what the company had in mind
with the No Lux feature, its press release said, was ``to record
nighttime activities, such as a new baby sleeping.'' Even though
400,000 units had been sold, the company still modified the
infrared transmitters on new cameras to remove even the most-remote
possibility of intrusive video taping.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of the story was a sure indication of the emotional
chords it struck in the collective unconscious. It illuminated the
darkness of our fears and fascinations about video surveillance.
People are increasingly nervous about being watched, yet they don't
seem to have lost their desire to see more themselves _ to see
through the dark, through walls, through the murk, to view a hidden
order.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's camera is not alone. No lux is new luxe: the latest
luxury option from Cadillac is a night-vision panel projected onto
the windshield, to aid drivers at night.
</P>
<P>
   Sales for night-vision equipment, ``civilianized'' from military
models by ITT Industries, the manufacturer of material for defense
and industry, are booming among boaters and hunters. Veterans swear
these models are inferior to less-expensive Russian models sold by
catalogs like Quartermaster and U.S. Cavalry; the idea of the magic
technology of a defeated enemy, after all, has its own appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The Herrington catalog, devoted to the latest gadgets, describes
the ITT Night Mariner binoculars it offers as piercing ``the pitch
black mysteries of the dark.''
</P>
<P>
   And ITT itself gives us a touching advertisement, showing how
its night-vision system found a boy lost in the snow: ``When a
child is lost and it's dark on the mountain, your heart breaks.''
The searchers followed footprints ``until new snow fell and covered
them. But our Night Vision showed his tracks through the new snow.
...''
</P>
<P>
   Here it was again, the modern myth, the most-extreme claim of
night vision, to see not just into the night, but through things,
like X-rays. Seeing through things means security, as at the
airport check-in scanners. Danger seen is danger disarmed; danger
seen at night, from a distance, makes for voyeurism.
</P>
<P>
   Night vision has been chic since Dan Rather went to Afghanistan
and the Gulf War lighted up Baghdad. Creating a world that seems
carved out of a single gritty-green mineral is a fixture of film
thrillers.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Patriot Games,'' Harrison Ford thwarts the IRA terrorists,
who are wearing night-vision goggles, by hiding in the basement of
a darkened house, then flipping on all the lights at once. The
seemingly blinded attackers scream and scratch their eyes in agony.
Outdoorsmen, familiar with night vision, snort at the idea.
</P>
<P>
   In the film ``Eraser,'' there's an even more fanciful futuristic
version of night vision: a scope on a rifle that, like a demonic
sonogram, can look into houses, through not only clothes, but also
through layers of the body, so that its cross hairs center on a
beating heart.
</P>
<P>
   Night vision has become a familiar mode on television shows like
``Cops,'' which offer furtive glimpses into the down-market
demimonde. The cameras on such shows send out the same sort of
waves as the viewer's remote control _ infrared.
</P>
<P>
   These waves, with lengths just beyond visible light _ they're
cousins to heat waves _ bounce from objects back onto chips that
electronically magnify them into images. Spies have long used
infrared; Weegee used it to capture nighttime New York. L.A.
chopper cops use infrared to pick out the still warm engine of the
stolen car from among those peacefully parked.
</P>
<P>
   But some of us hope to find something different in the dark.
Advertisements for Sony's NightShot show a cat and dog caught in
surreptitious embrace, in some high-tech version of Edward Hicks'
``Peaceable Kingdom'' paintings. The implication is that No Lux
will reveal not just a secret world of war and crime, but also an
ideal, peaceful one _ that it will see through the oppositions of
daylight.
</P>
<P>
   Is that what we hope to see in the dark? Perhaps the heat of
infrared does cast some light after all.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bleary-eyed and coffee-saturated, you wait for the commuter
train in the morning, then the subway, then for hordes of people to
cross the busy street. By the time you force yourself through the
revolving doors at 9 to get to work, the last thing you want to do
is wait for a crowded elevator to haul you up to your office.
</P>
<P>
   We could all take a lesson from the Three Stooges, for they knew
how to get an elevator pronto: a simple yank on the floor indicator
stick above the door inevitably brought the car to them
instantaneously _ along with a jumble of bewildered passengers
picking themselves up off the floor.
</P>
<P>
   That technique doesn't work that well today. After all, when was
the last time you even saw a mechanical floor indicator? In the
last 50 years _ with the banishment of human operators and
starters, individuals who stood outside elevator banks and, with
the flick of their metal clickers, told the operators to start
moving _ elevator management has become a computer-controlled
science, where improvements are measured in fractions of a second.
</P>
<P>
   The Holy Grail, according to Bruce Powell, perhaps the
industry's only certified elevator scholar, is to make elevator
operation seem effortless from the point of view of passengers.
</P>
<P>
   As sole possessor of the title ``technical fellow'' at Otis
Elevator Co. in Farmington, Conn., the industry leader, Powell
directs a team of people trying to figure out how to move as many
people as possible as quickly as possible in an elevator.
</P>
<P>
   Mechanically, elevators use the same basic design they did when
Elisha Otis invented the safety version in the 19th century (the
first modern elevator is said to have been built in 1743 in France
as a way for Louis XV to slink around the Palace of Versailles
undetected _ or, in an alternate version, to allow his mistress to
arrive clandestinely). Cars ride up and down a vertical track,
raised by either a hydraulic system or a counterweight. A series of
cables and ratchets stop the cab from falling; if a cab falls, a
safety brake kicks in to slow and stop it.
</P>
<P>
   Today's high-speed elevators have redundant safety systems. The
world's fastest elevator, in Osaka, Japan, can move at 2,600 feet
per minute (nearly 30 miles per hour), compared with the elevators
at the World Trade Center in New York, which can travel at 1,600
feet per minute.
</P>
<P>
   Greater speed does not mean greater danger. The last time an
elevator may have entered free fall was in 1945, Otis officials
say. That was when a B-25 bomber hit the Empire State Building
between the 78th and 79th floors, severing lift cables. A cab
dropped 75 stories, but the two women inside survived.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, automatic elevators went to floors in the order
the call buttons were pushed. Like an emotionally dependent golden
retriever, a car would go to the floor that issued the first call,
leaving other would-be passengers stranded. Elevators would arrive
at lobbies in packs, often empty, rivaling only Manhattan buses as
hallmarks of inefficiency.
</P>
<P>
   By the beginning of the next decade, mechanical elevator
dispatchers had been programmed to send cars all the way up and all
the way down, stopping for passengers along the way _ great if you
were the one on or off first, but frustrating if you were along for
the long ride. With zoned dispatching strategies, introduced in the
mid-1960s, elevators were designated as expresses, serving just
lower or higher floors, or as locals. Zone system technology is
still in use.
</P>
<P>
   One impetus for smarter elevators came from Asia's economic
boom. The growth of heavily populated skyscrapers created an ideal
market for better elevators. To make elevators more efficient, the
industry developed fuzzy logic, which allows a system to keep
several objectives in mind as it juggles elevator routes. If
someone on the eighth floor calls for the elevator, the electronic
controller is told, in effect: ``Hey, stupid, don't just send the
closest cab. Send the one a few floors farther away if it's empty
because it'll actually get there faster.''
</P>
<P>
   First used in a building in Osaka in 1993, fuzzy logic came to
U.S. shores two years ago in an Otis retrofit of the elevator
systems in the TransAmerica building in San Francisco. This is
fuzzy logic with a twist: not only did TransAmerica workers save
time in their vertical journeys, but they also found out which
elevator they would be taking the moment they asked because of
Otis' early car announcement technology. When a passenger asks for
an elevator, the system determines which car the passenger should
take and directs the passenger to that elevator door immediately by
flashing a light over that door _ instead of indicating the car
shortly before its arrival. To make sure that 20 embarking
passengers do not collide into 15 exiting workers, the system
directs riders to one or more empty cars that will leave more
quickly instead of to full ones.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the system can be misunderstood. After it was installed at
TransAmerica, an angry executive, misunderstanding the advance
signal, complained to the building manager that the elevators must
be broken because ``the elevator light came on and no car came for
a long time.'' Lunch-time lectures were quickly held to explain the
new system.
</P>
<P>
   The next big thing in the industry is perfecting neural
networks, computer programs that mimic, to some extent, the kind of
complex information processing done by neurons in the brain. A
neural network system not only learns from the past in directing
elevators but also tries to predict future behavior. The technique
is becoming possible only now, thanks to more powerful
microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   ``These systems will be like computer chess programs,'' Powell
said. ``They'll look at a building's traffic flow and posit `what
ifs.''' For example, elevator systems today can learn to adjust the
way they deploy their cars based on changes in passenger traffic in
the past few days. With a neural network, ``we'll be able to ask
what will happen to traffic and car availability a few minutes
after I send car A out and to instruct the system not to do so if
certain other conditions occur,'' Powell said.
</P>
<P>
   People should not have to modify their behavior to adapt to
elevators' needs, he said, adding: ``We'll need very speedy
computer chips. We want elevators to act more like us.''

JUST PLANE MISERY: GOD-AWFUL LUCK IS MY COPILOT 
</HEADLINE>

 By LAURI NOTARO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - ``So what's the weather really like in Phoenix during
the summer?'' the man across the aisle asked me as I leaned as far
over into the aisle as I could. ``I'm moving here in a couple of
months.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' I said, trying to separate my leg from my fellow
passenger sitting to the right of me, ``It's not hot enough to kill
you, just hot enough to make you want to die.''
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to die right about now, too. Heading toward Los Angeles
in a 737, I wasn't very happy, but I wasn't surprised. I've never
had good luck with airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Once, while flying back from San Francisco, the pilot
nonchalantly announced as we approached Las Vegas that one of the
engines had simply dropped off the plane and was now hurling toward
the ground at a ferocious speed to become the headpiece for some
showgirl.
</P>
<P>
   On another trip to Seattle, I checked in at the gate, and
instead of getting a seat assignment, I was handed a number, like
at a deli.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I'll take a ham on rye, easy on the mustard,'' I replied,
but the real joke was on me when I boarded the flight.
</P>
<P>
   With every seat occupied, crammed and overflowing, I looked down
the aisle and realized I wasn't flying on a plane. I was flying on
what could only be described as a Vietnamese bus gone airborne, and
I desperately waited for some flying chickens or a couple of mean
pigs to come snorting down the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   At snack time, the flight attendant started whipping out little
bags of peanuts and throwing them at people, and if you didn't
catch one, you just didn't get to eat.
</P>
<P>
   This time, headed to L.A. to visit friends, not only was I
hungry, I was in physical agony. Still not completely recovered
from a sinus infection, my head was full of so much pressure that
the only thing keeping the eyeballs in my head was some very badly
applied mascara.
</P>
<P>
   My right leg was stuck to the woman sitting next to me, bound by
perspiration and tight quarters. I felt empathy for her, because
her needs weren't exactly being met, either. We were all squeezed
into tiny little airplane seats, but for my neighbor, a
plus-plus-size woman, they provided even more of a challenge when
her extremities started to turn white because her blood wasn't
circulating.
</P>
<P>
   To be nice, I tried to give her as much room as possible, and
moved as far over to my left as I could, which pretty much put me
in the aisle. So far, it had been a horrible trip, and I was only
seven minutes into it.
</P>
<P>
   At the metal-detector station in the terminal, the guards had
insisted on searching my bag, and started to giggle as they dug in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, you're a married lady, huh?'' one of them said with a
smirk. ``The hole in your bra matches the one in your panties. Or
is that a deflated hot-air balloon?''
</P>
<P>
   They made me feel dirty.
</P>
<P>
   Now, here I was, swapping sweat with a strange woman who was
physically closer to me than I ever let my husband get, even on his
birthday. The only relief in sight was the flight attendant a
couple of rows ahead of me, nicely placing little bags of pretzels
on people's trays.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of work do you do?'' the man across the aisle asked
me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an antagonist,'' I said, wiping the sweat from my
forehead, not really in the mood for conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sounds scientific,'' he said, popping a pretzel into his
mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't cure cancer, I cause it,'' I said caustically, then
noticed his snack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where did you get those? I didn't see any flying pretzels!''
</P>
<P>
   ``The girl came by when you were fussing with your lady friend's
leg,'' he answered, popping another one.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not my friend,'' I said simply, stretching my neck up,
only to see the flight attendant move farther away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got my own business,'' my neighbor said, leaning closer
to me. ``And I figure it would do pretty well in Scottsdale. I'm a
distributor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' I said with a sigh. ``Cocaine or crystal meth? Cocaine,
I bet, because you'd have to live in Apache Junction for crystal
meth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm a regional manager,'' he said as I tried to flag down
the flight attendant. ``For Amway.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah?'' I said in horror. ``A cult job! My mom once bought
Amway shampoo, but when she went to throw it away, it had gone
through a molecular transformation and had eaten through the bottom
of the cabinet and down to the foundation of the house. Firemen had
to come and take it away. We had to live in a hotel for a week.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure could use somebody to show me around a new town,'' he
added, undaunted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm MARRIED,'' I said sharply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought so. Well, I don't care what people say. If you love
somebody, you should say so, no matter what the world thinks,'' he
said with a wink and a motion of his hand. ``I had already figured
you two were a couple.''
</P>
<P>
   I turned my head toward the direction of his motioning hand, but
the only thing I saw was my neighbor eating the last of her
pretzels.
</P>
<P>
   As I turned my head back around to tell him our joint sweating
was not conjugal, just unavoidable, I felt a dull thud and a sharp
pain and looked up to see the flight attendant rubbing her left
thigh. She gave me a dirty look and walked on, still rubbing the
spot where my head had hit her butt. As I rubbed my own head,
something sparkly and blue on the ground caught my eye, and as my
vision started to clear, I saw the soft halo of a beautiful little
bag of pretzels.
</P>
<P>
   With my dry hand, I reached out to get it. My fingers were
almost touching it, I almost had it in my possession, when
suddenly, the plane hit an air pocket and the pretzels shot down
the aisle to four rows ahead of me.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't even have enough time to scream in anger before we hit
another air pocket, then another and another, and the pilot
overhead instructed everyone to remain seated and to buckle up. My
knuckles clawed the arm rests, and I held on tight as the plane
embarked on a ride wilder than Mr. Toad's. My hands, I noticed,
were turning white with fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wanna hold hands?'' my neighbor to the right asked, her voice
shaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' I said, and gave her my sweaty one. &QL;

LEWINSKY AND WALTERS ARE KINDRED SELLOUTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Monica Lewinsky and Barbara Walters. Makes sense. Both have sold
out. Lewinsky and her dignity. Walters and her integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Time was when Walters was a scrappy journalist with everything
to prove, in an industry in which men talked on camera and women
fetched water to help the men clear their throats. Then came
celebrity and riches and a comfy niche. A TV journalist became a TV
personality.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Walters is the only interviewer who can chat with Tom Hanks
as though they're in the same line of work.
</P>
<P>
   In the process of covering show biz and news, Walters has become
show biz and news, her own entity. ``The Babs,'' or ``BW,'' as
she's affectionately referred to on the ABC morning talk show ``The
View.''
</P>
<P>
   I dismissed Walters as a serious newsperson long ago, way before
network news became as soft as a Nerf ball, long before you
couldn't figure out who was the larger celebrity, the interviewer
or interviewee. She'd taken her place in that world where charming
personalities vie for our attention, each apparently intent on
giving us not information and explanation but comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Walters does this better than anyone. Better than Oprah Winfrey,
better than Katie Couric, better than Fred Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's interview on the Walters-fronted 20/20 will most
likely fall during February, when her book hits shelves and the
networks seek to impress advertisers by scheduling over-the-top
programming for sweeps. The interview is certain to draw millions
and rank up there with her chummy chats with Gen. Colin Powell,
Christopher Reeve and Demi Moore, who, promoting a film, taught
Babs how to wiggle like a stripper.
</P>
<P>
   Walters mentioned this week on ``The View'' that she courted
Lewinsky like everyone else (reportedly Fox News and ``Hard Copy''
were ready to go to their vaults), but not by tossing large money
bags through her window. ``We don't pay for interviews,'' Walters
said.
</P>
<P>
   The cynic in me says ABC indeed slipped something under the
table, but if Lewinsky watched ``The View'' in the past year,
perhaps it was obvious that she couldn't find a more sympathetic
interviewer unless she paid for one.
</P>
<P>
   Just the other day, Walters talked of the ``terrible year''
Lewinsky is having, recounting the former White House intern's
``heartbreak'' that taped conversations with Linda Tripp were
surfacing and saying how ``innocent'' Lewinsky was in the whole
affair with President Clinton. Walters was on a roll, halting only
when it was obvious that this gushing was going even beyond her
standards. ``I'm certainly not her public relations person,''
Walters would say.
</P>
<P>
   A pause later, Walters was accusing the press (it's not
surprising that she talks of the media as a separate entity from
herself) of ``vilifying'' Lewinsky as a calculating, power-hungry
tart.
</P>
<P>
   Word is that Oprah Winfrey was also in the running for the
interview, but that was a no-brainer. In shows of this sort,
Winfrey's audience has been more likely to vilify the cheater and
the cheatee. (In Winfrey's world, everyone takes blame.) I can see
some audience members actually booing the woman.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky figured Walters was just the newsperson to lob softball
questions at her, to pull back if she begins to get teary, to, who
knows, hug her when bringing up the sensitive subject of love vs.
lust for power and position.
</P>
<P>
   I can see Walters leaning over at one point, handing Lewinsky a
tissue, and whispering, ``You loved him dearly, didn't you, child?
... Oh, how painful this must be.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, MSNBC's Jodi Applegate would probably have made a more
effective interviewer. Some say Cokie Roberts. (I can't imagine the
Lewinsky camp ever considering a male interviewer, except Fred
Rogers.)
</P>
<P>
   My choice? ``The View's'' resident jokester Joy Behar, who
cracks me up. At least we'd get a laugh out of it.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Those who wish to assure Social Security's
financial soundness for decades to come have suggested a variety of
ways to do so. But each of the solutions involve tradeoffs which
may make them unpopular.
</P>
<P>
   The four main components of reform plans being discussed are:
allowing individuals to privately invest their payroll taxes;
raising the retirement age beyond 67 or accelerating the schedule
for reaching 67; raising payroll taxes, or cutting benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the drawbacks to each proposal:

   NEW YORK _ Some gift shops have nice museums attached. In fact,
museum shops are proliferating so wildly that some might call it a
whole new mall game. They are bright little exhibitions all to
themselves _ good places for holiday browsing and gift-buying.
</P>
<P>
   At the American Museum of Natural History, one-of-a-kind
sequined banners and other arts and crafts are featured at the
Vodou shop outside the exhibition on the sacred arts of Haiti. The
Philadelphia Museum of Art has Moroccan handicrafts inspired by its
current Delacroix show. Successful shows make for successful shops,
and museums depend on the shops' profits, with public and private
money drying up. Last year, retail sales at the Metropolitan Museum
of Art totaled $83 million; two shops at the Museum of Modern Art
pulled in $20 million. At the Museum of American Folk Art, the shop
gave back $150,000. ``That might sound like a small amount,'' said
Jeffrey Grand, the director of finance and operations, ``but you
really miss it if it isn't there. And try to go out and raise that
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Emphasizing originality, museum shops like the MOMA Design Store
have been hiring curatorial elves with retailing prowess. But
unlike the situation at a department store, said John Curran, vice
president of retailing at the Met and an alumnus of Gump's, ``I
have 110 curators weighing in on new products.'' Museum shops offer
creative gifts for less than $25. Yes, you can shop on the Web (at
www.museumshop.com), but you'll miss the joy of ambling through the
museum show when you're done. &QL;

 &HT;    UNDER THE WHITE HOUSE, BIG IMPROVEMENTS ARE PLANNED
 &HT;    560&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two decades into the new millennium, a moving
sidewalk will carry tourists through a tunnel to the White House.
Correspondents will question the presidential press secretary in a
high-tech underground studio. But the first family will still see
softball games on the grassy Ellipse behind their historic home.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that's the ``carefully crafted vision'' that National
Park Service officials sketched Wednesday in an ambitious, 20-year,
$300 million ``Comprehensive Design Plan for the White House and
President's Park.''
</P>
<P>
   The project would accomplish the biggest alteration of the White
House complex _ albeit mostly underground _ since George Washington
approved the original design in 1791.
</P>
<P>
   It will ``effectively meet the demands of the 21st century
presidency'' while protecting historic structures and preserving
familiar vistas around 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., promised Robert
Stanton, director of the National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   The plan has been six years in the making, but still faces
scrutiny by Congress and several oversight agencies, as well as a
90-day period of public review, before any construction is begun.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, the current visitor's center, located across
15th Street southeast of the White House, will be expanded
underground. Four small theaters and interactive displays will be
added to keep tourists busy while they await their White House
tours.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than walking across 15th Street, the tourists will ride
moving sidewalks beneath it, coming up near the visitor's gate on
the sidewalk adjacent to the South Lawn. About 1.2 million tourists
visit the White House each year.
</P>
<P>
   Street-level parking would be banned from around the Ellipse
behind the South Lawn. White House staffers would instead park in a
two-level underground garage constructed beneath the park. The
Ellipse is the site of the National Christmas Tree, as well as
almost daily softball and soccer games and periodic mass protests
such as the annual ``Right to Life'' anti-abortion march.
</P>
<P>
   A second underground parking lot for senior staffers and
motorcade vehicles would be built below the section of Pennsylvania
Avenue directly in front of the White House, where traffic has been
blocked off since the Oklahoma City bombing raised security
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The Park Service did not include a plan for renovating the
street level of this stretch of pavement between the White House
and Lafayette Park. A pedestrian mall has been suggested, but would
have to be approved by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Deliveries to the White House would also be made underground,
with an entrance located near the New Executive Office Building.
located two blocks northwest of the White House. Tunnels would run
to an underground storage facility beneath Pennsylvania Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   An underground addition would be made to the present press room,
which is located between the West Wing and the main White House
building. The press briefing room would be moved into this new
facility.
</P>
<P>
   An underground recreational room for the first family would be
added just north of the existing executive mansion, and an
underground conference room would be located beneath Executive
Avenue, between the West Wing and Old Executive Office Building.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The Park Service plan had input from a dozen other agencies,
ranging from the Secret Service to the Commission on Fine Arts. It
concludes that past White House planning has been ``piecemeal'' and
resulted in an assortment of problems. There is no room to store
furniture, for instance, and no place for many White House staffers
to park their cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, Americans are unaware of these problems,''
the report said. ``On the evening news or the front page of the
morning paper, the white columns still gleam, the chandeliers still
sparkle and the lawns and shrubs remain impeccably groomed.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes will ensure that the White House continues to run
efficiently, Stanton said at a press conference where the plan was
announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan seeks to protect the historic site while making site
operations over the next two decades smoother and more efficient,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress would have to appropriate most of the $300 million cost
of the renovations, but the Park Service said some would come from
private donations.
</P>
<P>
   The Park Service's report is available on the Internet
(http://www.nps.gov/planning).

 By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Modernism can be dangerous. Just ask Cremilda
Conceicao, whose forehead and sweat pants bear the battle scars of
14 years of cleaning the see-through elevator, transparent sinks
and 17 levels of Plexiglas walkways and mirrored I-beams that snake
bewilderingly through the late architect Paul Rudolph's Beekman
Place triplex, perhaps the city's most stunning apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a crazy place, very accidental,'' she was explaining this
week, spritzing Windex as she recounted how she almost fell off a
balcony while trying to clean a Plexiglas platform that serves as
head-grazing ceiling for one level and the floor for the level
above. ``You're always cleaning back and forth, back and forth.
It's never ending.''
</P>
<P>
   The never-ending possibilities of space was a concept held dear
by the Modernist architect, who died at age 78 last summer. He left
behind a mysterious infinity-box of an apartment _ the building is
now on the market for $5.65 million, reduced from $6.25 million _
in which every detail was the product of his singular, some might
say obsessive vision, from a built-in television set encased in
chrome-plated Formica to steel staircases without banisters, whose
dagger edges continue to wreak havoc on Miss Conceicao's sweat
pants.
</P>
<P>
   The latest occasion for Windex was a party given by Nest
magazine last week, a dizzying affair that drew nearly 200 people,
some of whom found themselves drinking white wine and listening to
performance artists while trying to forget they were standing in a
cantilevered bathtub.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the transparent sink through which you could see into
the bedroom below. The most sought-after accessory may not have
been a Prada waist pouch, but a scopolamine patch for seasickness
tucked surreptitiously behind the ear.
</P>
<P>
   The apartment, a tectonic collision of abstract-mirrored and
transparent forms that occupies the top three and a half floors of
the nine-floor building, may ultimately be looked upon as a
poignant piece of modernist folk art.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Rev. Howard Finster's ``Paradise Garden,'' it is a
fiercely personal, handmade, never-finished laboratory of one man's
ideas. And like the Finster environment, it is in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   The creator of this passionate spatial fantasy, a rare, intact
artifact from the Plexi-Baroque period, was a celebrated
Harvard-educated architect, who served as chairman of the Yale
University School of Architecture from 1958 to 1965, and during his
lifetime was described by Mildred F. Schmertz, the former editor of
Architectural Record, as the ``world's most eminent diehard late
modernist.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he studied with Walter Gropius and was steeped in
Bauhaus, Rudolph's spaces were ``emotionally decorative,'' observed
Donald Luckenbill, who served as Rudolph's project architect from
1969 to 1982 and oversaw the apartment's construction (though
Rudolph tinkered with it practically daily until his death from
asbestos-related cancer _ ``He could never leave it alone,''
Luckenbill said).
</P>
<P>
   He loved making turns; for example, entering the apartment is a
Rod Serling experience in which floors feel tenuous and corners
seem to dematerialize in reflections. ``He wanted to reorient you
to the inside, to debrief you and then capture you in a new
world,'' Luckenbill said. ``He wanted to overwhelm, bedazzle you
with what he could do.''
</P>
<P>
   The apartment is indeed bedazzling. It was conceived as a
sequence of pinwheeling planes, the concept of split-level taken to
extremes. It is a piece of spatial choreography, composed of
mirrored steel beams and translucent acrylic bridges, that do not
form rooms so much as interpenetrate, changing elevations and
seemingly defying gravity.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph was constantly experimenting with materials, once
sheathing the apartment with Plexiglas floors, lighted from
beneath. He was not a big fan of furniture, so he invented
built-ins, like a daybed in which beige suede pillows are attached
with metal rings to steel springs, like a spiral notebook.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the apartment might be interpreted as the
rebellious act of a minister's son who pushed the limits of
conventional notions of space and home. ``It's not a normal home,''
said Peter Blake, an architectural critic and close friend. ``It's
a dream house, completely mad and uninhabitable in many ways, but
beautiful to be in.''
</P>
<P>
   The most uninhabitable spaces may be the bathrooms (mercifully,
a see-through Jacuzzi is now boarded up). But one bathroom has no
privacy, despite Plexiglas shutters. ``He was interested in
translucency,'' Ms. Schmertz said. ``Perhaps too interested.''
</P>
<P>
   The apartment also contains precipitous drops, modernist
crevasses, which, a close friend said, resulted in the loss of a
pet cat. ``People tried not to drink too much when they were at
Paul's,'' she said, ``but that poor cat. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the idiosyncratic space abounds in human touches,
like a spear from New Guinea that projects out defiantly from a
kitchen equipped with see-through shelves and see-through glasses.
Rudolph invented ingenious ways to organize his treasures, like
tiny Mexican milagros, marching single file along ribbons of Mylar
embedded in Plexiglas.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph's spirit seems to permeate the place even now,
accentuated by a small memorial surrounded by votive candles
containing his ashes. It is a shrine to modernism, one that is
betraying its age in scuffed chrome, buckling carpeting and fraying
Plexiglas.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of Rudolph's daring creation is of deep concern to his
friends and to those who envision the space as an architectural and
urban think tank. The Landmarks Preservation Commission does not
designate residential interiors unless they are open to the public,
though at 30 years old, the Rudolph design could qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Ernst Wagner, the estate's co-executor and a longtime friend,
says there had been an attempt to contact potential
modernist-loving white knights and former clients like Sid Bass,
the Texas industrialist. Sotheby's International Realty, the
property's agent, has placed ads in Malaysia, Singapore and other
outposts where Rudolph worked in his later years, marketing it as
contemporary. ``But the Asian economy is not exactly at the point
where many are able to make this kind of purchase,'' said Frederick
Williams, an associate broker.
</P>
<P>
   To Wagner, ``preservation is a key issue, because this was a
very, very personal piece of work.'' Thomas Heckman, an attorney
and the estate's co-executor with Wagner, said net proceeds from
the building's sale will go to the Library of Congress, home to
1,493 tightly packed tubes of renderings extricated over a two-day
period from the apartment. Meantime, the space is being rented out
for fashion shoots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unlike any place in New York,'' Blake said. ``I'm buying
lottery tickets myself.''

NEW PC: HOW TO KICK THE TIRES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pity the consumer who walks into a car dealership and says,
simply, ``I want to buy a car.'' The salesman probably attempts to
help the customer by asking a series of questions. New? Used?
Sedan? Sports car? Sport utility vehicle? Pickup truck? Minivan?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, golly, I don't know, which kind do I need?''
</P>
<P>
   In coming weeks thousands of consumers will go shopping for a
personal computer with an even foggier plan than that of the car
buyer above.
</P>
<P>
   In the commercial spirit of Christmas, which descended on my
town this year shortly after Halloween, I visited a local computer
emporium to pretend to shop for the computer equivalent of a
minivan.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping for a PC was not a pleasant experience.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt there are many knowledgeable, cheerful, courteous,
patient, empathetic salespeople working in computer stores whose
goal is to match consumers with the ideal computers to meet their
needs and budgets. I just didn &UR; ' &LR; t find any.
</P>
<P>
   Without further ado, here is some of the advice that I had hoped
to hear from the salespeople, but didn't:
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is the driving force for the computer industry
today. You do not need a fancy computer to connect to the Internet,
browse the World Wide Web, send and receive e-mail, or, for that
matter, to operate simple Windows business applications like word
processing, spreadsheets and scheduling. Any new computer will do.
Even a used computer of fairly recent vintage will do (for example,
an Intel 486).
</P>
<P>
   But software developers are coming out with cool new Internet
applications all the time, including audio and video, and they
almost always require more of everything _ microprocessor speed,
hard-disk space, bandwidth, graphics capabilities and so on.
</P>
<P>
   For the long term, your overall experience will be better with a
newer and more powerful computer, one that can be upgraded.
</P>
<P>
   If you wait, you will always be able to buy a better, faster and
cheaper computer a couple of months from now. By waiting, though,
you will miss the benefits of having a PC today.
</P>
<P>
   For those who cannot wait, rest assured that today's computers
are better than ever and better bargains than ever.
</P>
<P>
   For those who can wait, the new technologies coming in the
spring are very impressive. These include powerful new
microprocessors from Intel and AMD, a new crop of low-cost home PCs
and some special-purpose, low-cost, non-PC information appliances
that offer Internet access with less complexity than a PC.
</P>
<P>
   Procrastinators can also take advantage of price cuts that
typically come in February and March. Apple, for example, is
rumored to be planning to cut the price of the popular iMac to $999
after the holidays and to introduce an improved version of iMac at
the original price, $1,299.
</P>
<P>
   Craig R. Barrett, the chief executive of the Intel Corp., said
last month at Comdex that he expected to see PCs with Intel chips
for as little as $399 late in 1999. A Korean-backed company called
eMachines is already selling an Internet-ready computer with
Windows 98 but no monitor for $399, or $499 with a 14-inch monitor.
It is based on a relatively feeble Cyrix processor, but its
components are otherwise respectable.
</P>
<P>
   If all you want to do is connect to the Internet, browse the
Web, send and receive e-mail, do some word processing and simple
business applications, balance the checkbook and so on, almost any
new PC on the market today, even the low-end eMachines model, will
meet your needs.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to play the latest games or do fancy stuff with
multimedia, you will lust for more speed and power. Speed and power
cost more, sometimes a lot more.
</P>
<P>
   The cheapest computers are no-name clones, assembled from
bargain-bin components in so-called screwdriver shops. Some of
these PCs are surprisingly good. Others are cobbled together from
discontinued parts.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies, including Gateway, Dell and Apple, now offer
consumers the chance to buy or lease a new computer with Internet
access for as little as $50 a month. No matter how attractive the
sellers try to make such programs sound, consumers are always much
better off buying a computer with cash.
</P>
<P>
   But for those who lack cash and want to get a child or other
family member on line immediately, these programs offer an
affordable entry point.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, remember that buying a computer creates a hole in your
wallet that will leak for years to come. There will be more
spending _ a lot more _ for software; hardware upgrades;
peripherals, like modems, printers, scanners and digital cameras;
classes and instruction books; Internet access, and even for
computer furniture.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Brand-name machines, from Compaq, Dell, Gateway,
Hewlett-Packard, International Business Machines and others,
usually cost more but offer the security of technical support,
warranties and on-site service policies. Screwdriver shops often go
out of business without notice. Many people prefer to pay extra for
peace of mind.
</P>
<P>
   PC Magazine just released its annual survey results on customer
satisfaction. Only three makers of desktop computers earned an A
grade this year: IBM, Dell and Hewlett-Packard. For notebook
computers, the only As went to Dell and Gateway.
</P>
<P>
   Customers were asked to rate reliability, satisfaction with
repair experience, satisfaction with technical support and repair
frequency. The class clowns were Packard-Bell and AST Research.
</P>
<P>
   But enough general advice. Let's get down to the bitty gritty.
</P>
<P>
   A good salesman will ask, ``What do you want to do with the
computer?'' before making a specific recommendation. The trouble is
that people who have had limited exposure to computers often do not
know yet what a computer can do, much less what they want to do
with it.
</P>
<P>
   The safe route is to get a midrange machine _ a minivan _ that
is capable of doing most things well today and is capable of being
upgraded later, once a favorite task is identified.
</P>
<P>
   There is not room here to get into the Macintosh versus Windows
debate, except to note that an Apple Macintosh G3 can be set up to
run Windows software as well as Macintosh software. Still, more
than 9 out of 10 buyers will choose a Windows-only machine.
</P>
<P>
   Here are my minimum specifications for Windows-based machines:
</P>
<P>
   Processor: An Intel Pentium II with a speed of 350 megahertz or
higher. Or an AMD K6-2 processor rated 300 MHz or higher. Yes, it
is safe to buy a non-Intel processor. Frankly, lesser chips _ the
newest Intel Celerons, the older Pentiums with MMX, the AMD K6s,
the Cyrixes _ will all do fine for today's common applications.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pentium II 350 and higher and the K6-2 300s and higher
take advantage of a new and improved electronic plumbing system
built into better computers, technically called the 100-MHz
external bus, or PC-100 data bus.
</P>
<P>
   Older computers have a 66-MHz data bus. The faster data bus
makes most applications run faster, and it means that the owner can
upgrade to faster processors down the road.
</P>
<P>
   Memory: Microsoft asserts on its Web site that Windows 98 will
work on a computer with as little as 16 megabytes of system memory
(16 MB of RAM, or random access memory). Technically, that is true.
But technically, one can also play a round of golf with a 7-iron
and a putter.
</P>
<P>
   The experience is improved by having more clubs. (Except for my
game, of course, which would not suffer noticeably if I used a Coke
bottle, an umbrella and a pool cue.)
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, 64 MB is the practical minimum. Do not buy any
computer with less than 32 megabytes of RAM. Memory is very cheap
these days, so buy 128 MB if you can. Adding more RAM is the single
best improvement one can make to a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-disk drive: As long as software developers keep making
bloatware, you will need a bigger hard drive. Look for 6 gigabytes
(GB) or more.
</P>
<P>
   Monitor: The biggest you can afford.
</P>
<P>
   Modem: It must say V.90.
</P>
<P>
   Backup: The floppy disk is on its way to obsolescence. Consider
spending more for a Superdisk or a newer HiFD disk drive, which
works with older diskettes but offers much greater storage. As an
alternative, get a Zip drive or, better, a CD-R drive (which allows
you to write data onto a blank CD disk) to augment the floppy
drive.
</P>
<P>
   Fun: The low-end machines are not good for games. If games are
important, spend more for a better computer or get a separate Sony
Playstation. A DVD-ROM drive cannot record data, but it is a smart
alternative to a boring CD-ROM drive if you can afford it.
</P>
<P>
   You can still use your old CDs and install CD-based software,
and on higher-end systems you can also watch DVD movies. Yes, you
want a good set of speakers.

FOREIGN FILMS SHARE CANNES-DO ATTITUDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB McCARTHY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A record-tying number of foreign language films
from 45 countries have been submitted for Academy Award
consideration, including the first-ever entry from Kyrgyzstan.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon and Morocco sent entries in the Best Foreign Language
Film competition for the first time in 20 years. Under Academy
rules, each country is invited to submit its top film of the year.
This year's response ties the record set in 1994, according to the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Noteworthy are ``Eternity and a Day'' by the mercurial Greek
director Theo Angelopoulos, who took top prize at this year's
CannesFestival, and the runner-up, ``Life is Beautiful,'' by
Italian director Roberto Benigni. Foremost Russian filmmaker Nikita
Mikhalkov, who won the 1994 Foreign Language Oscar for ``Burnt by
the Sun,'' is entered again with ``Barber of Siberia.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Oscar race is news, some of the films will be
recognizable to audiences. ``Life is Beautiful'' and `The
Celebration'' by Danish filmmaker Thomas Vinterberg have already
opened in Los Angeles theaters. Spanish director Carlos Saura's
entry for Argentina, ``Tango,'' and the Brazilian-made ``Central
Station'' by Walter Salles are due to open.
</P>
<P>
   The Foreign Language Film committee begins screening entries in
December to select five for Oscar consideration. Nominations will

<P>
   I've certainly cried over television before. Those stock
triumph-over-tragedy movies have been known to reduce me to a
quivering mess of smeared mascara, and even though I know I'm being
had, I always fall victim to the schmaltzy AT&AMP;T commercials. And oh
yes, when I was younger and less hardened to the vagaries of
professional sports, I used to cry whenever the Minnesota Vikings
lost. (In those days, that meant quite often.)
</P>
<P>
   But until last month, I've never cried over my television
service.
</P>
<P>
   In this electronic age, we take television service for granted.
For most Americans, Katie Couric is either captured out of thin air
by an antenna or piped in via cable. That's for most Americans. I
was part of most America for 35 years, until my husband, a
photographer who can live anywhere for his work, decided he wanted
to be in the country, far from the urban plagues of crowds and
crime. I'd spent 10 years in New York and four in Austin, Texas,
and though living in the country wasn't my dream, it wasn't my
nightmare either.
</P>
<P>
   So off we went to a stone barn we had renovated on a 200-acre
piece of land 50 miles southwest of Austin, in the middle of the
Texas Hill Country, with its undulating horizon, massive live oaks
and impossibly green rivers.
</P>
<P>
   I am a freelance writer, and like many people who flee the city
for the serene countryside, I hoped that via fax, Federal Express
and the Internet I could conduct business as effectively as I had
before _ albeit with a few limitations, like a 1 p.m. Fedex cut-off
time.
</P>
<P>
   There have been some challenges, however. Before the phone
company upgraded our lines, we'd occasionally think a vacuum
cleaner had called when we picked up the receiver. ``Those
squirrels have been chewing on the wires again,'' the technician
would say when he came out to investigate the static. For a year
after we moved here, we had to use a long-distance number to
connect to AOL, which inhibited any surfing urges. Progress finally
came to Podunk in the form of a local server.
</P>
<P>
   We had trouble with our television, too. Even with a
decent-sized antenna, the picture looked like the closest thing the
Hill Country would ever see to a blizzard. But the solution seemed
easy: a satellite dish. Not a huge, wading-pool-sized number that
looks as if you are communicating with aliens, but a compact,
18-inch one. We mounted it on our dog kennel, and got beautiful
reception on a stupefying array of channels.
</P>
<P>
   For some time, we felt we had a slight technological edge over
our city friends. Not only because of the vast selection of
stations, but also because we received our networks from distant
cities (satellite providers do not tailor their transmissions to
local markets). I could sit in my living room, with cows roaming
outside in the fields, and _ in what seemed like a geography warp _
I could watch Chuck Scarborough and Sue Simmons deliver New York
news. Sometimes I would pretend I still lived there, and that if I
opened my door I'd be back on my old Chelsea sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   We also got a West Coast station for every network, so that if I
missed 60 Minutes at 6 p.m., I could catch it on the CBS station
out of Los Angeles at 9 p.m. One of our ABC stations came from
Nashville, close to my hometown, and I was able to keep up on
weather and political races there.
</P>
<P>
   The media junkie in me was ecstatic. I had a strange sense that,
while physically in the middle of nowhere, I was living everywhere
in the country at once. (Of course, we couldn't get our own local
television news, since satellite services offer very little local
programming; for that we relied on radio and the Austin paper.)
</P>
<P>
   Any perceived advantages came to a screeching halt in September,
when I clicked on PBS so my 17-month-old son could watch
Teletubbies. The screen was black, except for a note advising me to
call Direct TV, my satellite provider. I soon found that all of the
networks were off _ Fox, ABC, CBS and NBC _ though I still received
the other 300-some channels, from CNN to the Animal Planet network.
</P>
<P>
   After making a few distraught calls, this is what I learned: A
law passed by Congress in 1988 stipulated that a house was not
allowed to receive network programs through a satellite dish unless
it was ``unserved'' _ meaning it was not able to get an acceptable
picture from the local affiliates via antenna.
</P>
<P>
   The definition of ``acceptable'' was based on a standard devised
by the Federal Communications Commission in the 1950s, when fuzzy
pictures were more the norm.
</P>
<P>
   No one really paid attention to this for some years, and many
viewers in cities and suburbs bought dishes and got their networks
from far-off markets.
</P>
<P>
   This all changed when the Fox and CBS affiliates in Miami went
to federal court in 1997 and sued Primetime 24, which feeds the
networks to satellite providers like Direct TV. The affiliates
believed they were losing viewers and advertising dollars, because
many in their viewing area were getting their Ally McBeal and Cosby
from stations far from South Beach. The affiliates won the suit,
and in July a judge ordered all satellite providers to stop
offering networks to anyone but the unserved.
</P>
<P>
   Although the injunction will not go into effect until next
February, and related litigation is still going on, companies like
Direct have begin turning some customers off now, so that it will
be in compliance with the ruling. The FCC estimates that 2 million
people nationwide will be affected by the judge's order.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't worry too much when I heard this, remembering the
quality of our picture pre-dish. So I was quite shocked when I was
told two weeks after we lost the networks that we didn't qualify as
unserved and weren't going to get them back. I argued with the
Direct TV representative, rattling off our rural credentials _
miles from the closest city, hilly terrain that makes reception
miserable. ``We don't even have a Starbucks, for God's sake,'' I
declared finally. That gave her pause, but ultimately the only
thing she could do was advise me to call my Austin affiliates for a
waiver.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On the phone, the staff at most of the affiliates acted
sympathetic and asked me to send a letter explaining my situation.
In fact, the letters and my fervent appeals got me nowhere. Three
stations sent back a form response, essentially saying that it was
my satellite provider's responsibility to come out and test the
strength of my signal. If I didn't pass, the satellite provider
could give me my service back.
</P>
<P>
   I made one more call to Direct TV, and was told it didn't have
the manpower to test 1 million customers; I was designated
``served'' merely by my zip code, which out here covers a broad
swath of land.
</P>
<P>
   I was encouraged, however, to join a satellite provider lobbying
effort by calling a special 800 number, through which I would be
connected right to one of my senator's offices so I could vent my
frustration. At least one bill is before Congress to address the
problem by redefining what is an unserved area.
</P>
<P>
   The most exasperating part of this whole experience _ the thing
that brought me to tears finally _ was my call to the PBS affiliate
for a waiver. I expected no problem. It is, after all, Public
Television. But when I spoke to the head of the Austin station, he
told me they weren't granting waivers, period. He wouldn't even
allow me to write a letter stating my case. I was furious. Not only
do tax dollars help support the station, but I have been a regular
contributor to PBS all my adult life.
</P>
<P>
   I got off the phone and wept, much to my surprise. It's not that
television is that important to me in a couch potato sense. It's
important in my feeling that I'm maintaining a level of
``connectedness'' out here that somehow approximates the level that
came so easily in the city. My not getting PBS was the last straw,
and somehow a metaphor for life in the country. There are so many
amenities you give up out here _ dry cleaners, newsstands, take-out
Chinese _ I couldn't stand losing one more.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing what is going on in the world and the media, I realized,
is not just crucial for my work, but also for my sense of who I am.
For all its failings and all the statistics about falling
viewership, network television acts as a national community, and I
felt more isolated than ever from mainstream America. My
network-less stint began just about the time the Starr Report hit
and I was desperate to know what Ted Koppel was saying about the
whole affair; I wanted to hear the jokes Jay Leno and David
Letterman were making.
</P>
<P>
   I also noticed that I missed out on what are essentially
national rituals, like the new season of prime time shows. Though I
don't watch much prime time, I do like to check out a hot new show
to see what everyone is talking about. I've been told I'm not
missing much this year, but I would like to see for myself how bad
it all is.
</P>
<P>
   And despite ESPN, nothing beats the networks when it comes to
sports. I had to miss the playoffs and the whole World Series this
year (what hideous mistake by Chuck Knoblauch?). And when my father
visited recently, he was ready to drive to a friend's house in
Austin to catch his Sunday football.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly however, I long for the small traditions that had become
part of my daily routine. At 6 p.m. every weekday, while I made
dinner, I would watch The News Hour with Jim Lehrer, the most
calming source of news. Now, I look at the clock at 6 p.m. and
think of what I'm missing _ like a phantom limb that aches. What is
Michael Beschloss' take on the impeachment hearings? What does Paul
Gigot think of Newt Gingrich's demise?
</P>
<P>
   What I essentially discovered is that for me, the shows on
network television are similar to what they say about all the
cultural activities in Manhattan: It's not whether you indulge in
them that matters; it's knowing you can when you want to that makes
all the difference.
</P>
<P>
   At this point our choice is simply to accept our un-American
status until a new bill passes, or, as my local affiliates advise,
go the distinctly anti-high-tech route and put a 30-foot antenna on
our roof. But my husband and I spent too much time and money
renovating our house to turn it into a pin cushion. So for now
aesthetics are winning out. But George Clooney and the rest of the
folks at ``ER'' beckon.

THE SEARCH FOR SPEED 
</HEADLINE>
   By J.D. BIERSDORFER (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. What is xDSL technology and is it available in New York?
</P>
<P>
   A. The term xDSL refers to several types of digital subscriber
lines that speed up a user's connection to the Internet. While
conventional modem speeds are topping out around 56 kilobits per
second, the new technology offers significantly faster speeds.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most popular members of the xDSL family is ADSL (for
asymmetric digital subscriber line), which promises speeds of up to
8 megabits (8 million bits) per second for data coming to the user;
most users will probably see speeds of 1 to 4 megabits per second.
</P>
<P>
   Uploads can attain speeds up to 1 megabit per second. ADSL is
aimed at users who need to download a lot of information in a
hurry, like Web pages or digital video, but don't have to upload,
or send, a lot of material. ADSL is not universally available yet.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike cable modems, which offer fast connection speeds over a
shared line, ADSL uses special digital coding to get more speed out
of a single phone line. It also allows you to use a single
telephone line for both an Internet connection and for regular
phone or fax needs simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   An excellent Web site devoted to ADSL, www.adsl.com, contains a
table that shows what parts of the country have access to ADSL
service (yes, it is available in parts of New York).

FOREST SERVICE SCIENTIST CRITICIZES REDWOOD PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ A respected federal scientist said in a
report released Wednesday that the environmental plan designed to
protect a redwood forest in Northern California from loggers was
inadequate and would cause more mudslides and further threaten an
endangered fish.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie M. Reid, who works for the U.S. Forest Service, said that
logging of the Headwaters Forest by the Pacific Lumber Co. could
strip away vital vegetation that protects streams from erosion and
provides cool waters for the dwindling numbers of coho salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Reid's report, which was requested by Rep. George Miller,
D-Calif., is being touted by environmentalists who want to scuttle
an agreement with the logging company over the fate of the
privately-owned forest and its stand of old-growth redwoods.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Reid's report, environmental groups have gathered
some allies in their fight. People who live near the forest are
worried that continued logging by Pacific Lumber will cause ruinous
mudslides and foul their drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents of the Humboldt County town of Stafford have
already sued Pacific Lumber over a 1997 mudslide that destroyed 10
houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been trying to say, `Stop, already,''' said Nona
Kraus, 69, who lives near Eureka across a road from the north fork
of the Elk River. The logging ``is really doing a lot of damage to
the stream. It has absolutely destroyed the fishery in the north
fork. They have slide after slide after slide. The value of our
property is declining, along with the water quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a hard-fought deal, taxpayers will spend $480 million to
buy and permanently preserve about 10,000 acres of redwood groves
owned by Houston-based Maxxam, which owns Pacific Lumber and is
controlled by financier Charles Hurwitz.
</P>
<P>
   Wrapped up in the deal is an environmental plan covering about
180,000 acres surrounding the new Headwaters preserve. That plan is
being scrutinized by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the
National Marine Fisheries Service. The plan is supported by
President Clinton, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and California
Gov. Pete Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Reid's report is highly critical of the environmental
protections the plan promises. Reid, who prepared the report for
Miller and the Environmental Protection Agency, is an expert on
logging erosion and has worked for 20 years with fisheries
biologists.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Miller, she said that the environmental plan is
not strong enough to prevent logging-related landslides,
particularly near small streams. The plan will ``decrease the
likelihood of survival of any coho salmon migrating through''
erosion-choked streams.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the plan is changed, mudslides will cause ``increasing
damage to downstream properties and infrastructure, destroying
salmon (spawning grounds) and newly hatched fry, and increasing
rates of downstream bank erosion and stream-side landsliding.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the plan protects Pacific Lumber from liability, she
said, ``American taxpayers would become fiscally responsible for
addressing'' any problems that come up after the plan is approved.
</P>
<P>
   But Pacific Lumber questioned Reid's fairness, and points to
other scientists who have praised the environmental plan. John
Campbell, president and chief executive of the company, said
Pacific Lumber had agreed to study and find ways to correct erosion
problems over the next five years and, in the meantime, will not
log within 100 feet of large streams and 30 feet of smaller
streams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize Dr. Reid is a good scientist,'' Campbell said
Tuesday, ``but we're disappointed she appears to have abandoned her
scientific objectivity in this review. ... I think on this
particular review, it's important to understand that this is the
opinion of just a few scientists.''

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups hope that by enlisting local residents they
can persuade federal authorities to reconsider the environmental
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The logging company, which has been cited by state forestry
officials for 134 violations since 1996, was cited again in
September for continually running heavy logging equipment through a
large stream, said Karen Terrill, a spokeswoman for the state
Department of Forestry, which suspended Pacific Lumber's logging
license until at least Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Residents and environmentalists worry about additional
violations under the new Headwaters agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very real,'' said Paul Mason, president of the
Garberville-based Environmental Protection Information Center.
``The claims that logging doesn't have an impact on watershed are
hollow. People who have lived at the bases of these watersheds for
50 or 60 years have seen the shape of the stream change from being
a narrow, deep channel to being filled with silt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our domestic water supply has been ruined,'' said Nona Kraus'
husband, Ralph, 71, a former science teacher. ``Even in the winter,
it has a distinct taste of rotting vegetation.''

DRIVING IS THE ROAD TO RUIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA FRAZIER ANDERSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The learned folks who juggle statistics say that we are at a
greater risk of being injured while in an automobile than in an
airplane. That's quite believable, when you consider the thousands
of people who commute by plane every day and the fact there are
relatively few reports of major accidents in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, I pass accidents involving motor vehicles
almost every day. Some are minor fender-benders, and others require
paramedics and ambulances. Few of us will live our entire lives
without hearing the disheartening sound of crumpled metal as our
car collides with another.
</P>
<P>
   And that is the problem. I've acquired a fear of driving.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I have no fear of flying, unless the weather is bad. I'm
not afraid to eat at a truck stop where the waitress calls me
``Honey'' and wipes her hands on a dirty apron. I'm not even afraid
of those rental bowling shoes that never fit properly, but I do
have a growing fear of other drivers on the raging roads of life.
Ordinary, normally kind people get behind the wheel of a car and
lose their minds. ``Defensive driving'' has taken on a whole new
meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Think about all the wonderful new driving tips we've acquired
over the past decade. Keep your doors and windows locked at all
times, no matter how hot it is. Leave a full car length in front of
you when stopping at a red light, as an escape route in case of a
carjacking attempt. Don't ever flash your lights at another car; it
might be a gang member, and he might shoot you. Don't toot your
horn at anyone sitting at a green light; It might be an executive
who just got downsized and deleted, and he might shoot you. Never,
ever cut anyone off on the freeway, because it might be a psycho
terrorist on the run, and you know what will happen.
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder that so many people in large urban cities don't
even own a car? Who needs that kind of stress?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe when we get those flying cars in the next millennium,
everything will get better. Until then, hop in your car and
carefully cruise over to Circle T's Truck Stop out on the
interstate. Tell Big Mabel that you want one of those giant
chicken-fried steaks with cream gravy and a side of mashed
potatoes. Forget the salad; the lettuce is always brown.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I'm not implying that a big dinner will make your life a
bed of roses or clear traffic out of your path, but at least you
won't be hungry for a couple of days.
</P>
<P>
   Geez, will you look at that! I've gotta go. Those kids are
trying to steal my bicycle again!

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: DIDI AND GOGO IN MIDDLE AGE, UNCHANGING BUT
FRESH 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fifty years ago Samuel Beckett began writing
``Waiting for Godot,'' the play that was to transform his life and
alter the direction of contemporary theater. In a recent survey,
the Royal National Theater in London concluded that ``Godot'' was
the most significant English language play of the 20th century, a
point that no longer seems arguable.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, in the intervening years, the play has been seen and
appreciated by a wide theatergoing public, as demonstrated by the
current production at the Classic Stage Company in the East
Village. The times and the audience have changed, while Beckett has
remained immutable.
</P>
<P>
   When ``Godot'' opened on Broadway in April, 1956, critics held
it at a distance, as if it were a foreign body, a meteorite landing
on earth. They were so busy wondering what ``Godot'' was and what
it was doing on Broadway that they failed to recognize its
originality.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Beckett won the Nobel Prize in literature in 1969,
skepticism had faded and the world _ or at least part of it _ was
attuned to the author's message of fortitude in the face of
nothingness. The play and the playwright gathered their own
momentum. Soon Beckett was being taught on college campuses and the
paperback text of the play and his other plays went into endless
reprintings.
</P>
<P>
   Often after an artist's death, the work takes a downturn _ or
lands in limbo _ awaiting re-evaluation. With Beckett (who died in
1989), there was no waiting period. Since then, productions have
proliferated, and Beckett's audience has continually expanded.
</P>
<P>
   When Dublin's Gate Theater presented all his stage plays at the
first Lincoln Center Festival two years ago, it proved to be the
festival's highlight. The Gate will repeat the marathon next year
at the Royal Shakespeare Company.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Hall, who had staged the first London production of
``Godot'' in 1955, returned to it successfully last year (with Alan
Howard and Ben Kingsley). There were school children in the
audience who had not seen the play and did not even know if Godot
would come. They greeted it as a fresh new work.
</P>
<P>
   Something similar is occurring with the Classic Stage Company
production. Directed by Andrei Belgrader, it stars Tony Shalhoub
and John Turturro, actors who had profitable theatrical careers
before making their names on television and in films. Almost all
tickets to the show's limited run have been sold.
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously, Estelle Parsons is performing ``Happy Days'' at
the Hartford Stage Company. Along with ``Godot'' and ``Endgame,''
that play is a cornerstone of Beckett's work.
</P>
<P>
   From performances at both theaters, it is evident that the
confusion exhibited early on by theatergoers as well as critics has
disappeared. Now they sit back and enjoy the play, which is not to
say that their minds are at rest. At a recent Sunday matinee at
Hartford, the theater was filled with people choosing to spend an
afternoon with Beckett.
</P>
<P>
   After the performance, there was a public discussion about the
play and its author. From the questions, it seemed clear that
theatergoers were unfazed by the oddity that Winnie (Ms. Parsons)
was buried up to her waist and later, to her neck, in a mound of
earth.
</P>
<P>
   One theatergoer wondered if Beckett's audience was predominantly
older, overlooking the fact that there were people of all ages at
Hartford. Another asked about Beckett's influences, Joyce and other
playwrights. The response was that Beckett certainly owed a great
debt to Joyce and Synge, among others, but that his primary
influences were Laurel and Hardy, Buster Keaton and French and
English music hall and vaudeville clowns _ one reason for his
enduring popularity. It was added that Beckett was less the
influenced than the influencer.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, since Beckett's death directors have tried to be
more freely interpretive of his work. Earlier this season, Joy
Zinoman's production of ``Godot'' at the Studio Theater in
Washington featured black actors and looked at the play through the
prism of black vaudeville.
</P>
<P>
   In the belief that the production was contrary to the
playwright's wishes, Beckett's New York agent demanded that it be
withdrawn, a ban that was later rescinded by Edward Beckett, the
playwright's nephew and literary executor.
</P>
<P>
   For Edward Beckett, as it would have been for his uncle, the
question was not that of the actors but of the approach. Black
actors have often played ``Godot.'' Seven months after the original
Broadway production closed, it reopened with Earle Hyman, Mantan
Moreland and Geoffrey Holder. In 1980, the South African version
(with John Kani and Winston Ntshona) was presented at the Long
Wharf Theater in New Haven, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Beckett forcefully objected to any attempt at altering the
gender of a character. Often there were requests to do an all
female ``Godot'' and for an actress to perform ``Krapp's Last
Tape.'' ``It's a man voice,'' he said about ``Krapp.'' ``Were a
woman to do it, it would be like having a soprano sing a baritone
role.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly he would have objected to the idea of an all male
``Happy Days.'' The role of Winnie, as Dame Peggy Ashcroft
asserted, is ``a summit part'' for an actress, a female equivalent
of ``Hamlet.''
</P>
<P>
   On one other point the playwright was always adamant:
productions should follow his stage directions explicitly. In a new
book, ``No Author Better Served,'' a collection of 30 years of
letters between Beckett and his director Alan Schneider (published
by Harvard University Press and edited by Maurice Harmon), the
playwright offers fascinating insights about performance and
interpretation if not meaning. As Beckett described one production
of ``Happy Days'' to Schneider, ``all poised on a razor-edge and no
breather anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   When it came to questions of exegesis, Beckett refused to be
involved. In a very important letter to Schneider, written in 1957,
he insisted ``on the extreme simplicity of dramatic situation and
issue,'' and added, ``If people want to have headaches among the
overtones, let them. And provide their own aspirin.''
</P>
<P>
   With Beckett supplying drawings indicating stage movement and
also specifying the exact intention of individual lines, there is
no doubt that at each point he knew precisely what he was doing. In
a 1955 letter he said that Vladimir was ``the spirit'' of
``Godot,'' that in performance the character was restless and
``always on the fidget.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Godot'' was a sudden burst of intuition, but it is also a
carefully plotted work, as was also true of ``Happy Days,'' in
which Winnie's dialogue is interspersed with detailed descriptions
of her gestures and expressions, a minefield for any actress
attempting the role.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his reputation for pessimism, Beckett took a
philosophical position toward all questionable productions and to
the possibility of failure itself.
</P>
<P>
   In ``No Author Better Served,'' it is clear that he was calm
even in the face of hostility. His advice to Schneider as the
director was about to embark on the first American production of
``Godot'' (in Miami in 1956): ``Et courage! On les aura!'' or
``Courage, we'll win.''
</P>
<P>
   On this, as in other matters, Beckett had the last word.

SUSAN J. PETERSEN: THE VISION TO MAKE IT RAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   How did she know?
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course sex is `OK.' Again, if I didn't want you to play
certain games, I wouldn't have given you the toys. Do you give your
children things you don't want them to play with?'' That's God
talking, in the book ``Conversations With God,'' and the question
is how did Susan J. Petersen know when she read such pithy
utterings in the manuscript that they could translate into a huge
best seller?
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts in book publishing, Ms. Petersen has an acute
literary sensibility and an uncanny intuition about writings in the
spiritual dominion. Not out-of-body wizardry stuff, but mainstream
spirituality as befitting a woman who is interested in meditation
and is said to have visited an ashram and who published ``The
Cloister Walk,'' and ``Amazing Grace: A Vocabulary of Faith''
(Riverhead Books), both by Kathleen Norris and both of which made
the New York Times best-seller list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cloister Walk'' is about monastic life, not exactly a buzz
topic, but Ms. Petersen is a ``rainmaker,'' ultimately the highest
accolade in book publishing, a publisher who spots the showers
coming where others often don't; who publishes books that people
not only think they should read, but actually walk into a bookstore
and buy. Not many, for instance, would have guessed that Harold
Bloom's ``Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human'' (Riverhead), a
fat, expensive ($35), scary title, would become a best seller. Nor
would one naturally predict that James McBride's ``Color of Water:
A Black Man's Tribute to His White Mother'' would be on The Times'
paperback best-seller list for nearly two years, and still selling.
</P>
<P>
   One of Ms. Petersen's competitors, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said: ``It's not that all her books are best sellers.
It's that many of her books will probably sell and resell and
resell.'' Which is even better than simply having a best seller.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, her divining rod doesn't always find water. Riverhead
went into a Billy Joel project this year, and then it was dropped.
It also was said to have paid about $1 million for the paperback
rights for Marianne Williamson's ``Illuminata,'' a book about
prayer, which made the best-seller list but did not sell enough to
earn back such an advance.
</P>
<P>
   Book publishing often seems a whiner's trade, caught up in the
lamentations about consolidation and conglomeration, the fear that
somehow it will implode. Despite that ambiance, or perhaps because
of it, about four years ago Phyllis Grann, president of Penguin
Putnam Inc., decided to create a new publishing division that would
be more upmarket, quality driven, youthful than Putnam, and its
other imprints. Ms. Petersen proved that a major new publishing
presence such as Riverhead could be created and be successful,
despite the industry's habitual hand-wringing.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Petersen had left Ballantine at Random House in 1992 after
running it for about 16 years, her stormy personality
notwithstanding, and spent two years wandering about the mansions
of contemplation _ ``I had been working since I was 14 and didn't
know anything,'' she explained _ before she was hired by Mrs. Grann
to run the new division.
</P>
<P>
   (Last year, Ms. Petersen also took over running Viking, Penguin,
another Penguin Putnam Inc. division. Riverhead publishes about 30
hardcover books a year and retains all their paperback rights;
Viking and its groups publish about 130 books annually.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Petersen purchased Neale Donald Walsch's ``Conversations
with God: Book I,'' from Hampton Roads Publishing, a small press,
and published it for Putnam, not Riverhead. It's been on The Times'
best-seller list for almost two years. (Books II and III of the
series, also best sellers, were published by Hampton Roads.)
</P>
<P>
   To succeed as a publisher one needs many things: certainly an
entrepreneurial gift, but also that vision thing. ``I thought that
there were subjects that fascinated me,'' Ms. Petersen said, ``and,
therefore, probably fascinated other people. And then I had to look
for editors who would fit in, but would also extend my field of
vision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I got editors who were fascinated by the ways in which people
are alike, yet different, who would buy books that take me into a
different world that is compelling,'' she went on, in an interview.
``As obvious as it now seems to be, Harold Bloom's book shows a
rare vision of Shakespeare.'' So she hired Julie Grau, formerly of
Random House, and Celina Spiegel of Houghton Mifflin as
co-editorial directors, and Amy Hertz of Harper San Francisco as
her West Coast editor.
</P>
<P>
   Among others Ms. Grau bought ``An Instance of the Fingerpost,''
a 700-page novel about war-torn 17th-century England, that was
critically acclaimed and made the best-seller list this spring, and
it was Ms. Spiegel who trolled in Kathleen Norris.
</P>
<P>
   What is interesting about Riverhead is that nearly all its
books, fiction and nonfiction, reflect its publisher's vision: they
chronicle a journey that is physical and spiritual, with possible
absolution for those who take the trip.
</P>
<P>
   On the summer list, for instance, is ``The Group,'' by Paul
Solotaroff, which was acquired by Ms. Grau, about a particular
group in therapy, and James Morgan's ``Distance to the Moon: A Road
Trip into the American Dream,'' bought by Ms. Spiegel, in which a
man drives across the United States in his Porsche. ``Every decade
there's a personal journey book that is an interesting way to think
about the meaning of life,'' Ms. Petersen said. ``Its appeal is the
Lewis and Clark in all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as God said in ``Conversations with God'': ``There is no
such thing as `getting into heaven.' There is only knowing that you
are already there. There is an accepting, an understanding, not a
working for or a striving.''

CAN RUGRATS CROSS OVER? YES AND NO 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a time in the 1960s _ long before fast-food chains
began to distribute superhero action figures as freely as french
fries _ when my brother Jack and I lived for the ``Batman''
television show.
</P>
<P>
   If a particular episode truly moved us, the next morning we
would be out on the backyard swings, wearing Batman and Robin capes
that looked suspiciously like our mother's aprons tied across our
shoulders. We pumped our swings as high as we could, then jumped
off, shrieking, ``Take that, Riddler!''
</P>
<P>
   We concocted elaborate plots in which we trounced Freeze or the
Penguin (both played grudgingly by our schnauzer) or zoomed off to
the Bat Cave (the garage) in the Batmobile (our Schwinn Pixies,
with training wheels).
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, I realize that this was my introduction to
cross-over branding, the phenomenon that occurs when pop-culture
icons leverage their popularity in one entertainment medium to make
the leap to another. In those days, the distance that Batman and
Robin traveled was relatively tiny _ from the fuzzy black-and-white
set in our bedroom to the backyard swing set.
</P>
<P>
   Let the marketers point smugly to the Batman Color-Forms and
plastic Batmobiles that followed. To me, the true measure of the
effort's success is the fact that my brother and I still sometimes
greet each other with ``ka-Pow, Batman!''
</P>
<P>
   Today, life seems more complicated. In a single 24-hour period
last week, my two older daughters and I participated in a
1990s-style cross-branding extravaganza called the Rugrats. For
those who don't have kids: the Rugrats are television's band of
big-eyed cartoon toddlers who were recently transformed into stars
of both the cinema and the computer desktop (not to mention the
action figures).
</P>
<P>
   Curious to see how successfully the Rugrats would cross over to
new milieus, I watched my daughters watch an episode of the
television show, then accompanied them to the theater to see ``The
Rugrats Movie,'' then installed The Rugrats Movie Activity
Challenge CD-ROM game for them on my home computer.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what I observed:
</P>
<P>
   In front of the television set, the subjects (ages 9 and 7) sat
enthralled on the sofa. (For the purposes of this study,
``enthralled'' means that they were so caught up in the on-screen
action that no one noticed that one sister had violated a treaty by
placing her arm in the demilitarized armrest zone between their
seats or that the other was eating more than her fair share of
snacks.) When the show ended, both subjects asked if they could go
see the movie.
</P>
<P>
   At the theater, the subjects sat enthralled (see above) in their
seats, snickering during a scene in which the rebellious toddlers
undercut the authority of their doddering parents by escaping from
a playpen.
</P>
<P>
   At the computer, they sat politely for 10 minutes, working their
way through the Rugrats game's series of six simplistic tasks,
which mainly called for players to click on images of various
Rugrats or their vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, my daughters played Aqua Reptar, steering a
toddler-laden raft down a river by using the arrow keys on the
keyboard. Then they played a few rounds of Monkey Mayhem, in which
they used both the arrow keys and the spacebar to propel the
Rugrats into the air to grab jars of baby food away from jeering
monkeys.
</P>
<P>
   One subject said, ``Are you bored, Zoe?'' and the other
answered, ``Yeah, let's go ride bikes or something.''
</P>
<P>
   From this experiment, I concluded that although the Rugrats
brand was indeed strong enough to cross over from television, the
computer game version failed to hold the subjects' attention for a
simple reason: it did not take advantage of the possibilities of
its medium.
</P>
<P>
   All the Rugrats computer game had to do to win over my daughters
was to allow them to interact _ to identify with the slyly anarchic
toddlers in the same way that my brother and I had patterned our
play on Batman and Robin three decades earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the only portion of the game that managed to even
invoke the spirit of the Rugrats was a series of animated opening
screens (lifted almost verbatim from the movie) in which the
toddlers resembled Indiana Jones in diapers as they navigated a
dark cave to find treasure.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the game quickly deteriorated. At best, the
point-and-click scenes were vague reminders of the Rugrats. But
they had no more personality than a tattoo that ``dances'' when its
owner flexes a bicep.
</P>
<P>
   What would have worked better? For starters, building the game
around a strong narrative, the way the television episodes and the
movie are built. Then the computer game could have taken full
advantage of its interactive capabilities by giving players the
power to influence events.
</P>
<P>
   Let the players control the actions of the protagonists. Or
better yet, let them imagine themselves as the protagonists. Then
players will believe that they have a stake in the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   I am reminded of my daughters' all-time favorite computer
program, Oregon Trail. Created by a group of Minnesota teachers in
the 1970s as a text-based educational exercise played on punch
cards, Oregon Trail allows players to experience firsthand the
tribulations of the westward migration of 1848.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest multimedia versions distributed by the Learning
Co., players traveling cross-country with a wagon party must make
decisions every step of the way _ about how to overcome obstacles
like swollen, rushing rivers, for instance, or how to avoid the
deadly threat of cholera.
</P>
<P>
   In my household the true measure of a successful brand (which
the Oregon Trail mastered) is whether it crosses over and succeeds
in the rigorous interactive medium known as my daughters'
imaginations.
</P>
<P>
   After Zoe and Ellie abandoned the Rugrats Movie computer game, I
heard them scuttle down to the basement, where, an hour later, I
found them wearing pioneer costumes, fashioned from old tablecloths
draped across their shoulders. Aprons would have worked just as
well.

`CHILDREN OF THE FIELDS': TOO BUSY WORKING TO GO TO SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: program airs at 8 p.m. Eastern time)  
 (bl)  
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For 11-year-old James Flores, school is a sometime, somewhere
thing. He spends much of the year on the road in his family's
breakdown-prone old van traveling thousands of miles with his
father and seven brothers and sisters in hopes of catching a few
weeks of picking at harvest time.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of '98, as chronicled in Thursday night's
``Dateline NBC,'' it was a grueling four-month trip; if the oil
pump didn't conk out, it was the transmission. Working for less
than the minimum wage, the family didn't make enough to meet
expenses and ended up dragging back home to Texas worse off than
when they started. The focus of this report by Dennis Murphy is on
James, who by law should not have been working at all, the minimum
legal age for farm workers being 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children of the Fields'' is sketchy about the numbers of the
under-aged out picking, and, unlike famous past exposes, it doesn't
dwell on the conditions in which migrant workers exist these days,
except to note that electricity and clean water can be in short
supply. Murphy concentrates instead on a collusion between migrant
families and farmers to skirt the law.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers need the low-paid seasonal workers to bring in their
crops for a profit; the families need the muscle power of every
member, even an 11-year-old, to earn enough to keep the van running
and everybody eating. ``I have to help my dad,'' says James. When
the blueberry crop fails in Michigan, the wage goes down to $2.35
an hour.
</P>
<P>
   As for the big food processors like Heinz, which buys the
cucumbers that the Flores clan picks in Ohio, they declare their
abidance to the law against employing minors (``We just won't
tolerate it'') but don't seem to go to excessive exertions to
enforce it. The report suggests that the prevailing rule in
American agriculture is, ``Don't ask, don't tell.''
</P>
<P>
   One farmer, who runs into trouble when James is discovered
working his pickle farm is shamefaced about his reliance on workers
whom he can't afford to pay a decent wage. But another makes the
vehement case that James is better off working the fields along
with his close-knit family than in a broken home. A sorry choice,
yet the evidence of family unity adds a softening touch to their
harsh odyssey.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, James manages to get some schooling, but next
season he'll be 12 and so permitted to work legally. The hour is a
painful look at the migrant-worker condition and at an engaging,
dutiful, plucky boy who seems on his way to giving up what chance
he may have to get through high school in an effort to help his
family get through a hard life.

   The New York Times computer football ranking is based on an
analysis of each team's scores with emphasis on three factors: who
won, by what margin and against what quality of opposition. The
quality of an opponent is determined by examining its record
against other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Times computer model collapses runaway scores and takes note
of a home-field advantage. Recent games count more than earlier
games.
</P>
<P>
   The top team is assigned a rating of 1.000; the ratings of all
other teams are percentages reflecting their strength relative to
the top team. This week, for example, there is a very large
difference between Denver (No. 1) and Minnesota (2), and a much
smaller difference between the Jets (3) and Atlanta (4).

   In ceremonies Wednesday in Cambridge, Mass., the English
architect and urban designer Sir Norman Foster and his London-based
firm, Foster &AMP; Partners, received the fifth Veronica Rudge Green
Prize in Urban Design from the Harvard Design School. Foster &AMP;
Partners was chosen for two projects: the subway system in Bilbao,
Spain, and the development of the Carre d'Art Plaza in Nimes,
France.

   The 15-by-11-inch painting looked like a Rembrandt. It was
labeled a Rembrandt. Its subject was Rembrandt himself. But on
Wednesday the unsigned oil, ``Self-Portrait With Gorget,'' which
has hung for years in the Mauritshuis museum in The Hague,
Netherlands, was judged by experts to be a copy. A signed version
hangs in Germany. Researchers using infrared technology and X-rays
discovered outlines of the portrait under the Mauritshuis painting,
and because Rembrandt never made outlines, experts agreed it was
probably a copy by one of his students.

the photographer known as Brassai, the Museum of Fine Arts in
Houston will open what is billed as the first major American
retrospective of his work in three decades. The show, ``Brassai:
The Eye of Paris,'' from Sunday through Feb. 28, will feature about
140 works by Brassai (1899-1984), who focused primarily on scenes
of everyday Paris life and the leading artists, writers and

the saxophonist and composer Oliver Lake that draws on more than
200 poems submitted by more than 90 people of all ages and
backgrounds living in and around Montclair. In addition, the piece
by Lake, a founder of the World Saxophone Quartet, features a poet,

THE SPLENDID RAGE OF TIBOR KALMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN HOCKENBERRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Choice and free will have lost some of their
philosophical luster in our day. Updated and retooled through the
decibels of corporate advertising, free will is today expressed as
the fashionable condition of being edgy or in your face. In
America, corporate symbols, the young, the famous, all aspire to
this sublime state. The same blank look of disaffected angst sells
everything from stockbrokers to Buicks to white cotton briefs. Free
will in the classical sense implies that you actually do something.
Being edgy requires only that we show up, late of course, and that
we buy something.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, the designer Tibor Kalman did much more than
show up. Kalman's brilliance has been to sustain, throughout his
career, a tirade against oppression and for intellectual freedom.
He has maintained that tirade with fearless biting humor and a
legendary, often withering grumpiness toward those who disagree
with him.
</P>
<P>
   Kalman's visual manifestoes rail against hyperbole about our
technological future. His work in advertising, journalism and
graphic design constitutes a eulogy for the single clear voice.
That voice, a blunt water cannon, has delighted in hosing down
storm troopers of style and fashion around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Kalman (called Tibor even by those who do not know him) may be
an obscure, egghead personality, but his work is everywhere. In the
1970s, he designed distinctive medieval-looking shopping bags for
Barnes &AMP; Noble that became the signature for a global retail
empire. He produced the memorable East-meets-West logo _ a coat of
arms with chopsticks _ for the midtown Manhattan power room China
Grill, and hilarious menus and advertising for the downtown
after-hours mecca Florent.
</P>
<P>
   Kalman designed perhaps the '80s' greatest album artwork, for
Talking Heads, matching the impenetrable nerdiness of lead singer
David Byrne with a collage of color, primitive typography and
techno-images. And he was behind Colors, Benetton's radical and
mysterious magazine. His memorable images invariably evoke the
response: ``He did that? I love that.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a body of work breathtaking to behold all at once, which
is the best thing about ``Tibor Kalman: Perverse Optimist''
(Princeton Architectural Press, $60), a handsomely produced volume
published last month that is an archive of and homage to the
designer.
</P>
<P>
   The book is also an oddly appealing scrapbook of Kalman's
passions, which include his family and his hard-to-nail-down
politics. It is a playful greatest hits compilation of his most
important work with M&AMP;Co, the groundbreaking design firm he founded
with his wife and collaborator, the artist and children's book
author Maira Kalman.
</P>
<P>
   In the fine print is his own story, entertainingly told by
various contributors, including Kalman himself. He is interviewed
by writer Kurt Andersen. We learn how the child political refugee
from Eastern Europe fell in love with America even as he was
repulsed by its capitalist excesses in the 1950s and '60s. At New
York University, he joined SDS and in 1970 he made an illicit trip
to Castro's Cuba to learn farming, which could have earned him a
deportation hearing.
</P>
<P>
   He dropped out of NYU, and as a ``paste and prop boy'' making
window displays for a college bookstore, he started his career. The
store's owner, Leonard Riggio, was then cobbling together a retail
business that would become Barnes &AMP; Noble.
</P>
<P>
   Kalman's education as a designer never got much beyond cutting
sugar cane; yet, he directed Barnes &AMP; Noble's national advertising,
a job that landed him a position as director of visual
merchandising at the E.J. Korvettes chain. Using M&AMP;Co as his
mysterious cover, he went on to design watches, calendars and
stationery items (a genre Kalman calls Yuppie Pornography), and to
produce the logo and type for the fashion designer Issac Mizrahi,
his neighbor in Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   M&AMP;Co's forte was a kind of anti-corporate voice and feel that
attracted well-heeled clients like Knoll Furniture, the Limited,
the 42nd Street Development Project, ABC News, Lifetime Television
and a number of museums and movie studios thrashing about in the
1980s and '90s for some succinct statement of purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Kalman supplied it. But it was his reputation as a salesman and
irrepressible charmer that brought the greatest legend and
financial success to M&AMP;Co. The book is at its most interesting as a
deconstruction of an influential designer's interior interplay of
craft, inspiration, personality and pure ego.
</P>
<P>
   As his stature grew in the design community, Kalman became
famous for his shocking, iconoclastic presentations at stodgy
professional meetings of designers and architects. Most designers,
he claimed, were prissy sycophants; successful designers were
fronts for the evils of the system. For Kalman, design award
ceremonies became an irresistible opportunity to expose
exploitative corporate business practices. Fashion companies were
bluntly excoriated for their inhuman wages in Third World
countries. Manufacturers were showcased as rapists of the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   In his public appearances, Kalman demanded that designers make
themselves relevant by focusing on the concrete needs of a
prosperous industrialized society plagued with poverty and
inequality. A great story line in this book shows how the more
Kalman railed against corporate hypocrisy and waste, the more
successful he became and the bigger clients he attracted.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Olivieri Toscani, creative director at Benetton, hired
Kalman to start up Colors, a global magazine envisioned as the
perfect union between corporate sponsor (Benetton) and editorial
content (Kalman). In visual style, Colors was seductive and
shocking; yet, it was as journalistically aggressive as more
conventional publications. There were single-concept issues on
Heaven and AIDS. A poverty issue contained a global map of where
the people live versus where the money is. Radical for its time,
the editorial style has since been imitated by publications like
The New Yorker and U.S. News &AMP; World Report.
</P>
<P>
   Colors had no interest in celebrities and took few
advertisements, a radical concept. But because it was devoid of
explicit advertising and had a design that deliberately blurred the
conventions of commercial and editorial copy, each image had the
effect of wordlessly evoking Benetton as a benevolent godfather.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, this drew considerable criticism. Yet, the
early issues of Colors were Kalman's troubled, brilliant
masterpiece. Each offered a slice of his passions, outrages and
visual experiments. For an issue on race, for instance, he depicted
Queen Elizabeth and Arnold Schwarzenegger with black skin, and
Spike Lee as a white guy with a goatee and blue eyes.
</P>
<P>
   With Colors, Kalman became a storm trooper of style. His
vocabulary of biting visual contrasts begat the more timid generic
edge of the moment. As a social reformer, Kalman has a less secure
legacy, a condition that is also a commentary on the profession of
design. Designers are along for the ride in corporate America. They
do not get to drive. Yet, Kalman can at least claim to have
demanded the keys.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Colors under Kalman was too lavish a production and
too challenging visually to sustain itself. This is one of Kalman's
great talents: finding the fabulous big-budgeted project and
through it pushing his personal vision to the limit until the
project either implodes from excess or the client's money runs out.
Here he is Michelangelo _ a subversive virus infecting his clients
and making them do very entertaining things. His annual report for
the Limited during one of its worst years reads like a contrite
public humiliation ritual from a Maoist re-education camp. It did
not reassure stockholders. M&AMP;Co was not asked back.
</P>
<P>
   It should be said that Tibor Kalman is also one of the great
acid-tongued monsters of his or any other profession. People on the
receiving end of his frostiness are featured in the book: Elisabeth
Sussman, a museum curator; the restaurateur Florent Morellet, and
Mizrahi. Ingrid Sichy had a stormy collaboration with Kalman at Art
Forum and Interview magazines. She named him Creative Troublemaker
on Interview's masthead. In an affectionate and candid testimonial,
she compares Kalman with the upper-crust fashion iconoclast Diana
Vreeland, whom Kalman might have targeted for a pie in the face had
he met her at a party.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '90s, when I was a correspondent for ABC News, I
had a brief encounter with Kalman. Tom Yellin, the executive
producer at ABC News, had hired M&AMP;Co to design the logo for a new
prime-time news magazine and to come up with a title for it. Kalman
suggested ``Naked Eye,'' a not so subtle slam at the competition,
CBS, and its eye logo, and a prophetic commentary on what would
become the whole mission of television journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Although Yellin loved it, ``Naked Eye'' was trashed by network
management in favor of the more conventional ``Day One.'' ``Good
clients are smarter than you,'' Kalman says in the book. ``Bad
clients are dumber than you.''
</P>
<P>
   On balance, this book, like his work, is oddly touching for all
its bluster. Unstated but poignant on every page is the hint of
Kalman's struggle with cancer, which has taken a toll on his
outward vitality and gives this whole volume the somber feel of a
retrospective.
</P>
<P>
   His free will intact, Tibor Kalman lives on.

A WRITER WITH AN EAR FOR THE MELODY OF PEASANT SPEECH 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIAS, Lanzarote, Canary Islands _ Looking back on his life from
the outpost of his 76 years, Jose Saramago still finds it hard to
believe that on Dec. 10 in Stockholm he will become the first
Portuguese-language writer to receive the Nobel Prize in
Literature. Not that he was a surprise choice: he was already the
pundits' favorite last year when the prize went to Dario Fo of
Italy. It is just that, as he puts it softly, ``I was not born for
this.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of a peasant father and an illiterate mother, brought up
in a home with no books, he took almost 40 years to go from
metalworker to civil servant to editor in a publishing house to
newspaper editor. The accident of unemployment in his mid-50s
finally led him to risk life as a full-time writer. And he was 60
before he earned recognition at home and abroad with ``Baltasar and
Blimunda.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, if the tall, slim, bespectacled Portuguese likes to
remind people that he ``was not born for this,'' it is not only out
of bemusement at his late-in-life success. It is also to explain
that his distinctive narrative style, his ironic voice, his
unrestrained imagination and the allegorical themes of his books
are all products of his life before he became a writer. ``I think
it simply has to do with my past,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That this past is also deeply rooted in the history and
literature of what was long one of Europe's poorest and most
isolated countries may well have narrowed his focus, but Saramago
feels this has worked in his favor. ``I believe that the more
authentic the expression of the cultural roots of an author, the
more understandable it is to people from other cultures,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, while profoundly Portuguese, Saramago remains an
outsider: an atheist and a Communist in a Roman Catholic and
conservative land.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 a center-right Portuguese government even vetoed his
novel ``The Gospel According to Jesus Christ'' on the ground of
blasphemy. Furious, he left Lisbon and moved to this volcanic
Spanish island off the west coast of Africa with his wife, Pilar
del Rio, a Spanish journalist.
</P>
<P>
   After his Nobel Prize was announced in October, it was the
Vatican's turn to lament that for the second year running the award
had gone to someone it perceives to be anti-religious. ``Why does
the Vatican get involved in these things?'' Saramago asked,
uncharacteristically raising his voice. ``Why doesn't it keep
itself busy with prayers? Why doesn't it instead open its cupboards
and reveal the skeletons it has inside?''
</P>
<P>
   But in Portugal, where walls were plastered with posters
proclaiming ``Congratulations, Jose Saramago,'' he was now received
like a prodigal son. ``The prize became a national happening,'' he
said. ``People came up to me, not to congratulate me _ that would
be normal _ but to say, `Thank you, thank you,' as if the Nobel
Prize were a sort of recognition for all my countrymen, as if
everyone had grown one inch taller.''
</P>
<P>
   The prize abruptly ended Saramago's tranquillity, assaulting him
with the vagaries of sudden fame, a topic he treats mockingly in
his latest novel, ``Todos os Nomes,'' or ``All the Names,'' still
to be published in English. But the flurry of recent weeks has also
led him to reflect on his life, to rummage in his past for the
incidents and influences that explain why, what and how he writes.
</P>
<P>
   Two childhood memories stand out. Although his parents moved to
Lisbon in 1924, when he was 2, he always spent vacations with his
grandparents in his birthplace in the village of Azinhaga in the
Ribatejo region. They bred pigs and, in the winter, he recalled,
they would take weak piglets to their bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we can imagine the two oldies, covered with blankets, in a
cold house, freezing outside, and between them, like their own
children, two or three piglets, being heated by human warmth,'' he
said, slipping into storytelling mode. ``Of course, they would be
killed later. Life was like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Years later, he said, his grandfather suffered a stroke and was
to be taken to Lisbon for treatment. ``He went into the yard of his
house, where there were a few trees, fig trees, olive trees,''
Saramago said, ``and he went one by one, embracing the trees and
crying, saying goodbye to them because he knew he would not return.
To see this, to live this, if that doesn't mark you for the rest of
your life, you have no feeling.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At primary school, young Jose loved reading and writing but,
with no money for further studies, at 12 he entered an industrial
college to learn the trade of metalworker. To his delight, the
school also offered a course in literature.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he began work as a metalworker at 17, he was
dreaming of becoming a writer. He switched jobs to become a clerk
in a hospital and began spending evenings in a local library.
``When I was 25, I wrote a novel, `Land of Sin,' and amazingly it
was published,'' he said, ``although it went unnoticed.''
</P>
<P>
   But after he sent a second novel to a publisher and it never
returned, he stopped writing. ``I don't think I was conscious of
this at the time, but looking back, I think I reached the
conclusion that I had nothing important to say,'' he mused, ``so I
went 20 years, from 1947 to 1966, without publishing a word. I had
no regrets. I wasn't even collecting experiences to recount later.
My writing period was over. I just lived my life.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, while working for a Lisbon publisher, he published
two books of poems, but nothing more ambitious. At the time,
Portugal was ruled by a rightist dictatorship that had been in
power since 1926, but this did not explain Saramago's silence. ``I
was not a victim of fascist oppression,'' he said. ``There were
great writers who continued to write against all odds. I took no
risks because I had nothing to say.''
</P>
<P>
   At least not in a literary sense. Having joined the Communist
Party in 1969, he began writing editorials in a Lisbon newspaper,
struggling daily with official censors. After the April 1974
revolution toppled the regime, he became deputy editor of a newly
nationalized Communist-dominated newspaper, Diario de Noticias,
until he was thrown out of his job by an anti-Communist
counteroffensive in November 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can probably thank this for the fact I became a writer,'' he
said. ``Finding myself out of work, defeated politically, I decided
the time had come to determine if I really was a writer. I felt I
had something to say, but I didn't know what. In `Manual of
Painting and Calligraphy,' published in 1977, about a painter who
writes to reflect on how badly he paints, I indirectly pose the
basic question: `Now, Jose, what are you going to write?' ''
</P>
<P>
   In his next book, ``Raised From the Floor,'' a neo-realistic
story of oppressed peasants struggling for land, he addressed what
would prove to be an equally important question: how was he going
to write? ``I did the research in the Alentejo; then for three
years I couldn't write it,'' he said. ``Finally I began, but it
still wasn't right. Then, around page 23 or 24, without even
thinking about it, I began to write in the way that became my
particular style of narrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only does this dispense with orthodox punctuation, like
question marks or quotation marks for dialogue, but also it hops
between past and present tenses. ``I later understood why this
happened,'' Saramago said. ``I had been listening to the stories of
peasants who could not read or write, so I said to myself, `Tell
them the stories they had told me.' That's how I found the voice of
the narrator. And I didn't need punctuation because that's not how
we talk.''
</P>
<P>
   In his breakthrough novel, ``Baltasar and Blimunda,'' this
technique enabled him to tell a story set in the early 18th century
_ about an eccentric priest, a one-armed army veteran and a
mystical woman and their attempts to fly _ as a story being
recounted today. Similarly, the narrator in ``The Gospel According
to Jesus Christ'' offers his version of Jesus' life, but also
refers to what has happened to Christianity since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who say I write historical novels are totally wrong,''
he said. ``They are novels that deal with things that happened, but
it's the same to me if they happened yesterday or 2,000 years ago.
I see time as an enormous cloth where everything that happens is
projected in a chaotic manner. It is the writer's job to find the
line that links things that happen at different times and facts
that appear to have nothing to do with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The History of the Siege of Lisbon,'' in which a
proofreader tries to change history by adding the word ``not'' to a
description of crucial events 850 years earlier, the novelist
reflects further on time. ``History is not a science, but a reading
of facts that can be interpreted a thousand ways,'' he said.
``Think how often history has been rewritten to suit political or
ideological circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Some ideas for books simply come out of the blue. For example,
``Blindness,'' published to acclaim in the United States this fall
by Harcourt Brace, which has brought out most of his books in
English, was born while he was waiting to be served in a
restaurant. ``The question suddenly came into my head, `And if we
were all blind?''' he recalled. ``And then immediately, as if
answering myself, `But we are all blind.' '' And from this came his
allegorical account of a city swept by an epidemic of sudden
blindness.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most intriguing is this atheist writer's fascination
with religion. In ``The Gospel According to Jesus Christ,'' it is
apparent that he knows his Bible, and he treats the figure of Jesus
with compassion, as a victim of a power struggle between God and
the Devil. But his underlying message is that religion has turned
man against man in wars, massacres, exterminations, autos-da-fe and
the like, ``all in the name of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, with his books translated into 25 languages, the
international appeal of his fiction is no longer a mystery. ``The
themes that interest me are questions that I think concern
everyone,'' he said. ``I'm thinking of my own relationship with the
world, with society, with time, with history. There is also a way
of narrating, a greater or lesser degree of emotion, an ironic look
at powerful institutions, perhaps all of this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But in the end,'' he went on, ``I could only be a Portuguese
writer. Some people need to make references, like the `Garcia
Marquez of Europe,' but I don't think this is the case. There are
many differences between us, all of them favoring Garcia Marquez.
But I believe my work is a direct product of my imagination, my
concerns. I have always lived in isolation. I read everything, but
my roots are Portuguese.''

MANY A CROSS WORD ENCOUNTERED HERE

<P>
   Q: Who invented the crossword puzzle? _ D.S., Decatur, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: The first crossword puzzle was devised by Arthur Wynne in
1913 for the ``New York World'' newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Wynne created puzzles each week for the ``World.'' On Dec. 21,
1913, his ``Word-Cross'' puzzle was published for the first time,
according to Famous First Facts.
</P>

   The puzzle had the same rules as current crossword puzzles but
an unusual shape. Words crisscrossed one another on a
diamond-shaped grid with black squares in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Wynne quickly settled on a rectangular shape and the name
``Cross-Word'' for his puzzles. In 1924, fledgling book publishers
Dick Simon and Lincoln Schuster introduced crosswords to an
international audience by issuing a bestselling collection of ``New
York World'' puzzles.

   Q: Why is Chicago called the ``Windy City''? _ J.E.P.,
Baldwinville, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A: According to information gathered by the Chicago Public
Library Information Center, the name comes from a century-old
battle to host the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago and New York competed to host the exposition, and
long-winded Chicago boosters weren't well-received in the rival
city.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York Sun'' Editor Charles Dana urged readers not to
believe the ``nonsensical claims of that windy city. Its people
could not hold a world's fair even if they won it.''
</P>
<P>
   A better choice for windiest city is Blue Hill, Mass., with an
average wind speed of 15.4 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am a big fan of native Texan Tommy Lee Jones. Where can I
write to him? _ A.S., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to Jones in care of International Creative Management,
8942 Wilshire Blvd., Beverly Hills, CA 90211.
</P>
<P>
   During an Oct. 30 polo match near Houston, Jones was thrown from
a horse and stepped on. He was hospitalized overnight but suffered
no serious injuries, contrary to some early media reports.
</P>
<P>
   The 52-year-old actor runs a polo club on his ranch near San
Saba, the town where he was born. He recently completed his 36th
film, ``Double Jeopardy,'' with Ashley Judd.  &QL;

 UNDATED: computer furniture.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brand-name machines, from Compaq, Dell, Gateway,
Hewlett-Packard, International Business Machines and others,
usually cost more but offer the security of technical support,
warranties and on-site service policies. Screwdriver shops often go
out of business without notice. Many people prefer to pay extra for
peace of mind.
</P>
<P>
   PC Magazine just released its annual survey results on customer
satisfaction. Only three makers of desktop computers earned an A
grade this year: IBM, Dell and Hewlett-Packard. For notebook
computers, the only As went to Dell and Gateway.
</P>
<P>
   Customers were asked to rate reliability, satisfaction with
repair experience, satisfaction with technical support and repair
frequency. The class clowns were Packard-Bell and AST Research.
</P>
<P>
   But enough general advice. Let's get down to the bitty gritty.
</P>
<P>
   A good salesman will ask, ``What do you want to do with the
computer?'' before making a specific recommendation. The trouble is
that people who have had limited exposure to computers often do not
know yet what a computer can do, much less what they want to do
with it.
</P>
<P>
   The safe route is to get a midrange machine _ a minivan _ that
is capable of doing most things well today and is capable of being
upgraded later, once a favorite task is identified.
</P>
<P>
   There is not room here to get into the Macintosh versus Windows
debate, except to note that an Apple Macintosh G3 can be set up to
run Windows software as well as Macintosh software. Still, more
than 9 out of 10 buyers will choose a Windows-only machine.
</P>
<P>
   Here are my minimum specifications for Windows-based machines:
</P>
<P>
   Processor: An Intel Pentium II with a speed of 350 megahertz or
higher. Or an AMD K6-2 processor rated 300 MHz or higher. Yes, it
is safe to buy a non-Intel processor. Frankly, lesser chips _ the
newest Intel Celerons, the older Pentiums with MMX, the AMD K6s,
the Cyrixes _ will all do fine for today's common applications.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pentium II 350 and higher and the K6-2 300s and higher
take advantage of a new and improved electronic plumbing system
built into better computers, technically called the 100-MHz
external bus, or PC-100 data bus.
</P>
<P>
   Older computers have a 66-MHz data bus. The faster data bus
makes most applications run faster, and it means that the owner can
upgrade to faster processors down the road.
</P>
<P>
   Memory: Microsoft asserts on its Web site that Windows 98 will
work on a computer with as little as 16 megabytes of system memory
(16 MB of RAM, or random access memory). Technically, that is true.
But technically, one can also play a round of golf with a 7-iron
and a putter.
</P>
<P>
   The experience is improved by having more clubs. (Except for my
game, of course, which would not suffer noticeably if I used a Coke
bottle, an umbrella and a pool cue.)
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, 64 MB is the practical minimum. Do not buy any
computer with less than 32 megabytes of RAM. Memory is very cheap
these days, so buy 128 MB if you can. Adding more RAM is the single
best improvement one can make to a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-disk drive: As long as software developers keep making
bloatware, you will need a bigger hard drive. Look for 6 gigabytes
(GB) or more.
</P>
<P>
   Monitor: The biggest you can afford.
</P>
<P>
   Modem: It must say V.90.
</P>
<P>
   Backup: The floppy disk is on its way to obsolescence. Consider
spending more for a Superdisk or a newer HiFD disk drive, which
works with older diskettes but offers much greater storage. As an
alternative, get a Zip drive or, better, a CD-R drive (which allows
you to write data onto a blank CD disk) to augment the floppy
drive.
</P>
<P>
   Fun: The low-end machines are not good for games. If games are
important, spend more for a better computer or get a separate Sony
Playstation. A DVD-ROM drive cannot record data, but it is a smart
alternative to a boring CD-ROM drive if you can afford it.
</P>
<P>
   You can still use your old CDs and install CD-based software,
and on higher-end systems you can also watch DVD movies. Yes, you
want a good set of speakers.

ESCAPES FROM DEATH ROW ARE RARE, BUT HAVE HAPPENED BEFORE  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KIM COBB 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unlike Texas death row inmate Martin Gurule, who had to scale a
razor wire-topped fence amid gunfire from the guard tower,
condemned inmate Robert Lewis simply walked unchallenged through
the gate of a Florida prison in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how it happens, an escape by a dangerous inmate is
a nightmare for anyone in the prison business.
</P>
<P>
   Prison administrators around the country are following the news
of Gurule's escape from Texas' death row with keen interest and,
occasionally, real empathy. Although death row breakouts are rare,
they have happened before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety-nine percent of all escape plots, we stop them,'' said
Harry Singletary Jr., Florida Secretary of Corrections. ``But it's
the fear of every correction administrator ... where the next high
profile escape will come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these people who escape, all you do is wait out at
their Mama's house,'' Singletary said. ``But it's a scarey thing
and my heart goes out to the folks in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've probably got citizens out there who are armed _ it just
escalates, and a lot of bad things can go wrong, including the
inmate hurting somebody. I've been praying for them, and I hope
they'll be able to recover the inmate. I know what it's like to
have 500 people out there looking for dangerous folks,'' Singletary
said.
</P>
<P>
   The American Correctional Association reports there were 9,482
escapes nationwide in 1997 out of a total prison population of
slightly more than a million. But spokesman Jim Turpin cautions
that different states report escapes differently _ for example,
Texas reported 20 escapes and 19 returns that year, while Illinois
reported 1,000 escapes with 962 returns. Turpin said that Illinois
may be including such things as bail jumpers and parole violations
as ``escapes.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida had its own escape from death row in 1978, when Lewis
simply walked out of the prison unaccosted, wearing a guard's
uniform which had been smuggled in by a visitor under his own
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Corrections Department spokeswoman Debbie Buchannan said the
visitor went to the visiting area bathroom, shed the uniform, and
returned to the visiting area. ``Bobby Lewis went into the bathroom
and changed into it and for lack of a better term, simply walked
out,'' said Buchannan.
</P>
<P>
   Inmates and visitors are no longer allowed to use the same
bathrooms, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He actually got to the back gate where only cars are allowed
in and out, and told the officer in the tower his wife had been in
an auto accident and he had to go home,'' Buchannan said. ``They
opened the gate.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis remained at large for about 10 days before he was
apprehended in South Carolina and his death sentence was later
overturned.
</P>
<P>
   States like Florida and Texas have some of the largest prison
populations in the country, with hundreds of people waiting for
execution. But Virginia gets the nod for the biggest death row
escape on the books.
</P>
<P>
   On May 31, 1984, six condemned men took 13 prison employees
hostage, stripped them of their clothing, tied them up and locked
them in a cell. They managed to convince prison officials they had
a bomb, which turned out to be a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   The six had one of the hostages call in the ``bomb'', they
masqueraded as guards in prison riot gear and, after pretending to
neutralize the bogus bomb with fire extinguishers, drove out of the
Mecklenberg Correctional Center in a prison van.
</P>
<P>
   One of the escapees was arrested in Vermont about a week after
the breakout. The rest were captured within three weeks. Lem Davis
Tuggle Jr., the last surviving member of the escape team, was
executed in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are some of the highest risk inmates we have. They have
nothing to lose insofar as they're looking at death in prison,''
said Nic Howell, spokesman for the Illinois Department of
Corrections. ``So we expect them to be high escape risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far as I can recall, we've never had an escape... even an
escape attempt in death row,'' Howell said. But Illinois has had
its share of other escapes, including one which occurred during the
filming of a prison movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nick Nolte was filming the movie `Weed' and this one guy got
out by hiding in one of the trucks they used to bring in stuff for
the movie,'' Howell said. ``He was caught three days later in
either South or North Dakota.''
</P>
<P>
   But many prison officials point to the 1920s and 1930s as the
wild years for prison breakouts, before sophisticated prison
security made things more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were inmates at Stateville who killed an assistant
warden, commandeered a truck, put a ladder on it, went up the
ladder to go over the wall,'' Howell said. ``Statesville's walls
are 33 feet high.
</P>
<P>
   ``An armed tower officer saw what was going on and fired on
them,'' Howell continued. ``They had taken a hostage and the
hostage was killed in the fusillade. One of the inmates was killed
and the rest subdued.''
</P>
<P>
   But a half a century later, two prisoners went over the wall at
Statesville again, this time on New Year's Eve, and this time they
made it, Howell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We chased those two guys for a period of time,'' Howell said.
``In fact we caught one of them in Dallas or Houston a month or a
month and a half later. He was going to bartender school. The other
guy we found in the Carolinas.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola, the natural
barricade presented by the adjacent Mississippi River has always
made escape more dangerous, and inmates have drowned in the swift
waters. But at Angola, they remember Charlie Frazier's escape in
1933 as the prison's most daring.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and 10 other inmates escaped from Angola,'' said prison
museum curator Nadine Tanner. ``One of the inmates had gotten his
common-law wife to smuggle a small-caliber gun in during visiting
hours. It was a Sunday afternoon, there was a baseball game going
on and everyone was involved in that.''
</P>
<P>
   One inmate was shot during the escape, she said, as well as the
captain of the prison guard. The inmates got to the Mississippi
River at a time when it was low, hopped on a log and floated
downriver to a sandbar, and eventually made it to the other side.
</P>
<P>
   The group split up at that point, Tanner said, and Frazier sent
some of the escapees on to a point where he knew they'd be caught,
creating a diversion for his own escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he and several of the other inmates made it all the way
to Northern Louisiana,'' Tanner said. ``They robbed banks in North
Louisiana, Texas and Arkansas. They went on a spree, but he was
caught in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was returned to Angola, he was welded into his cell,
Tanner said, where legend has it he remained for eight years.
Frazier died in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day in every (prison) system in the country there are
inmates hatching escape plots,'' Florida's Singletary said.
``That's part of what people held against their will do. The more
secure your place becomes, because of fences, razor wire and armed
patrols _ the more elaborate the escape plots will become and the
more they try to compromise staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to always have to worry about looking within _ that
inmates would try to escape from within,'' Singletary said. ``But
now people from the outside may come and help them escape by
blowing up a tower or your fence or taking out your patrols on the
perimeter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our last murder of a staff member was Officer Fred Griffith.
He was on an escort taking an inmate to a medical appointment and
two ex-inmates tried to break him out,'' Singletary said. ``They
ended up killing our officer. Both of them are on death row in
Florida now. These things are getting more exotic.'' &QL;

 &HT;    PBS lets us all groove on Darin's cool moves
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone with half a grasp of the history of popular song knows
that Bobby Darin could sing. His treatments of ``Beyond the Sea''
and ``Mack the Knife'' (the latter the swingingest treatment ever
of a serial killer) are part of the pantheon.
</P>
<P>
   But it's nice to be reminded, or to see for the first time, how
the dude could move.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of clips from old TV shows, ``Bobby Darin: Beyond
the Song'' (9:30 E.S.T. tonight on WGTV) gives us a cocky young guy
who glides around a stage with a beguiling fluidity; in body
movement (though not in musical taste), he could be the father of
Beck.
</P>
<P>
   This new PBS special (part of a PBS pledge drive, so be prepared
for interruptions) is packed with golden clips.
</P>
<P>
   On Darin's first TV appearance in 1956, he doesn't have cue
cards, so he writes the lyrics to ``Rock Island Line'' on his hand
and keeps surreptitiously glancing down. Jimmy Durante, on some
uncredited variety show, does an extended goof with Darin, with
each imitating the other. In a 1970 concert, he does ``Mack the
Knife'' in its entirety (thank you, PBS, for not cutting away).
</P>
<P>
   But Darin's personal life was as bizarre as his onstage act was
finger-poppin'. Born Walden Robert Cassotto, he had a congenital
heart defect, and he said he never expected to live past 30. He
made it to 37, when his heart gave out during an operation in 1973.
A few years before his death, he had learned that the woman he
thought was an older sister was his biological mother, and his
``mother'' was really his grandmother. In a spooky clip from a 1959
``This Is Your Life,'' he's reunited with his ``sister'' at a time
when he didn't know she was his mother. Imagine what Jerry Springer
would have done with all this, and be thankful for the gentility of
an earlier time.
</P>
<P>
   Darin was first known as a rock 'n' roller with hits such as
``Splish Splash.'' Dick Clark, one of many who reminisce about
Darin, recalls that when the singer said he wanted to make an album
of standards (one that included ``Mack''), Clark told him: ``Are
you out of your mind? That's the kind of stuff you'd hear a lounge
lizard do. You're a rock 'n' roll singer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Splish Splash'' now sounds like a novelty record, while ``Mack
the Knife'' will forever be identified with the deepest shade of
cool.

   Haworth leaving CNN
</P>
<P>
   CNN is losing a valued player at the end of the year with the
departure of Steve Haworth, the company's chief spokesman for a
decade. As vice president of public relations, Haworth has
frequently been called upon to issue official comment on
CNN-related stories ranging from ratings during the Persian Gulf
War to this summer's Operation Tailwind debacle. He's also been one
of CNN's key executives in planning corporate strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Network spokesman is a high-turnover, high-burnout job (sort of
the TV equivalent of White House press secretary) that Haworth
handled with grace, aplomb, honesty and extremely hard work during
his years at CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Haworth is leaving CNN and his longtime home in Atlanta to
become vice president of communications for RealNetworks Inc., a
Seattle-based Internet company that markets streaming video and
audio.

   NEW YORK _ With the bravado of youth, the Adobe Theater Company,
a nonprofit troupe that prefers to spell its name in lowercase
letters, shuns other unnecessary highs: high art, high-handedness
and _ until their recent transfer to the 170-seat Actors Playhouse
in Greenwich Village _ high overhead.
</P>
<P>
   But after their critically acclaimed ``Duet!: A Romantic
Fable,'' a pulpy parody of puppy love and American culture, closed
with sold-out houses in SoHo last year, this Off Off Broadway
troupe took the leap to their first open-ended commercial run and
reopened the play Off Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our original mission statement was, `We do what we want to
do,' '' said Jeremy Dobrish, the company's 30-year-old artistic
director and founder. ``We hope we are still doing that, but with a
little more attention.'' For the eight-year-old Adobe, a company
that has, Dobrish said, ``cleaned toilets and rat droppings in
small downtown theaters so we could work there,'' the move is
significant.
</P>
<P>
   Combining talking animals and punning trees with macabre plot
turns, ``Duet!'' seems poised somewhere between Saturday morning
cartoons and ``Saturday Night Live'' as directed by David Lynch,
and geared to an audience weaned on television.
</P>
<P>
   The 75-minute show was developed and staged in episodes for five
years by Erin Quinn Purcell and her co-writer and co-performer
Gregory Jackson, whom she had dated 12 years ago when they were
freshmen at the University of Iowa. The play, which focuses on a
young couple (portrayed by Ms. Purcell and Jackson, both 30) who
meet and begin dating, opened in its current form in in 1997 at the
75-seat Ohio Theater, directed by its two chief performers and
Dobrish.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who is not an Adobe member, said, ``The spoof quality
of `Duet!' was something Erin and I had done since college, and it
was great that the Adobe, with its playful esthetic, found us and
we found them.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the company's move ``uptown'' to the Village could not
be financed alone. Adobe's average annual operating budget is about
$83,000; it has cost $190,000 for the commercial remounting of
``Duet!'' To the rescue came Dodger Endemol Theatricals, a producer
of such current mainstream Broadway fare as the musicals
``Footloose'' and ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are fans, pure and simple,'' said Michael David of Dodger
Endemol, which became a producer of ``Duet!'' ``I came to them
after seeing three of their shows. `Duet!' is such good theater
that it seemed serendipitous to support them at this time. It's a
win-win situation. They need us, and we felt the need to expose the
future of the theater. Twenty-five years ago, grants and
foundations did this sort of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' support of ``Duet!'' may reflect a trend in New
York theater: producers with deep pockets, often with several
Broadway productions up and running, taking financial risks on
shows clearly aimed at younger audiences. Fran and Barry Weissler
are planning to produce the commercial transfer of Kenneth
Lonergan's ``This Is Our Youth,'' now at Second Stage.
</P>
<P>
   And the Shubert Organization's backing of the recent ``Stupid
Kids,'' a tale about being gay in high school, was a play,
according to Gerald Schoenfeld, the organization's chairman, that
was ``taken on in the hopes of getting young people into the
theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Now a collective of 26 actors, designers and playwrights, Adobe
initially involved six people when it was founded in 1991, five of
whom were friends from Wesleyan University, including Dobrish and
Christopher Roberts, 31, the producing director. The troupe's
offices were in Dobrish's living room in the Flatiron district of
Manhattan until 1997, when they rented office space from the
Atlantic Theater Company in Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   With his beard, pony tail and casual clothes, Dobrish, who grew
up on the Upper West Side, still looks like a college student. The
fact that he and Roberts called their company Adobe to evoke a
sense of homeyness and because the word to them looks like ``a
visual palindrome,'' reflects the kind of breezy collegiate style
that still informs some of the company's work.
</P>
<P>
   Their first break came in 1992 when a company dropped out of its
rental agreement with SoHo Rep, and Dobrish, then working at the
theater, was given the booking in exchange for box office duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't turn it down, even though I had no play,'' he said
recently over lunch in a diner near his apartment. ``I threw
together an evening of sketches called `True Words Are Never
Spoken,' hardly our crowning achievement, but it launched us.''
</P>
<P>
   This early effort, which Roberts wryly describes as ``modest in
its ambitions and its achievements,'' made an instant playwright
out of Dobrish, who has since written or directed most of the
company's 20 or so productions. It also defined the troupe's
esthetic, which draws from ``high art to pop culture, fairy tales
to urban myths and traditional theater to modern performance art,''
in Dobrish's words.
</P>
<P>
   In his review of ``Duet!'' in The New York Times last year,
Peter Marks called the company ``an 80-channel cable television
system, accepting signals from a host of sources.''

`LITTLE VOICE' FALLS A LITTLE SHORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 2 { Stars 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With her moptop haircut and prodigious nose,
actress Jane Horrocks bears more than a passing resemblance to a
``Hard Days Night'' era Ringo Starr _ except for the singing voice.
Horrocks doesn't need a little help from her friends. She can
imitate them. From a brassy Shirley Bassey to a quivering Judy
Garland, Horrocks can capture every legendary inflection, right
down to the smallest hand gesture and facial expression.
</P>
<P>
   Horrocks is the best reason to see ``Little Voice,'' a wildly
uneven movie about a sheltered, fragile young woman who won't speak
but can sing up a storm. The film was adapted from an English play,
``The Rise and Fall of Little Voice,'' and, my guess is, it worked
much better as a live stage show than it does as a movie. But
Horrocks' presence, along with a devilish supporting turn from
Michael Caine and a soundtrack full of marvelous standards, ensures
more than a few entertaining moments.
</P>
<P>
   Horrocks plays LV (or Little Voice), a young woman who lives in
the dark attic of her father's once thriving record shop. Dad is
dead now, and LV has never quite recovered from that. She plays
albums from his record collection night and day, developing an
uncanny ability to sing along with the likes of Bassey, Garland,
Marilyn Monroe and Marlene Dietrich.
</P>
<P>
   LV may never talk, but her obnoxious mother, Mari (Brenda
Blethyn), more than fills the sound void. Ever on the prowl, Mari
has her sights set on a low-life talent promoter with the wonderful
name of Ray Say (Caine). Obliging and convivial (at least on the
surface), Ray is convinced that he could have made it big if only
he had caught one lucky break. When he overhears LV singing ``Over
the Rainbow,'' Ray realizes he has found his meal ticket.
</P>
<P>
   One problem: LV doesn't want to perform in public. For her,
singing is a private therapy, a way to cope with her tortured
relationship with her spiteful mother. The ties between mother and
daughter should be ripe for exploration, but writer-director Mark
Herman's script doesn't delve into the subject until it's much too
late.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that he didn't reign in Blethyn's over-the-top
performance _ she comes off as a cross between Eliza Doolittle and
any dunce from the royal family _ doesn't help matters much,
either. Neither does a rather pointless subplot involving Ewan
McGregor as LV's pigeon-loving suitor.
</P>
<P>
   Horrocks' nuanced performance almost makes up for all these
shortcomings, though. Having originated the character on stage, she
knows LV inside and out and delivers a rollicking revue once Little
Voice takes to the stage. Caine is equally enjoyable, particularly
in a quiet scene where he convinces LV to go public with her
talents. It's an indelible reminder of a talent too often hidden
through the years by poor choices.

 NEW YORK: of sources.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While this cut-and-paste style may be more the rule than the
exception on Off Off Broadway, Adobe differs from other downtown
troupes in its focus on the audience. Spectators can buy beer and
soda onstage before a performance and are invited to talk with cast
members after every show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where else do you get a sense of community these days, besides
church or the local bar?'' Dobrish said.
</P>
<P>
   Early experiments with audience involvement included pre-show
pranks like an on-stage ringing telephone. And ``fun'' and
``entertaining'' seem to be favorite words of Dobrish and Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Wood, an actor currently playing the title role in ``Side
Man'' on Broadway, performed in Dobrish-directed productions with
the Adobe between 1992 and 1994. Wood compared the current
``Duet!'' ``to everything Adobe does, in that it captures the
company's spirit: sweet, but not afraid to show the grotesque side
of human nature, like Grimms' fairy tales.''
</P>
<P>
   Dobrish, in fact, adapted a Grimms tale for ``The Handless
Maiden,'' his company's well-received play last spring that was set
in both ``the faraway kingdom of New York City'' and magical
forests of demons.
</P>
<P>
   Like their art, Dobrish and Roberts wear their erudition
lightly, quoting rock musicians (John Lennon and Bob Dylan) rather
than Bertolt Brecht or Antonin Artaud to explain their artistic
philosophies. And they borrow from everyone, including critics.
</P>
<P>
   When Ben Brantley, writing in The New York Times, described
Adobe's 1995 film-noir satire ``Blink of an Eye'' as ``Pirandello
on Prozac,'' Dobrish thought, ``Hey, I've read `Six Characters in
Search of an Author' but I should read some more Pirandello.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, adapting an obscure Pirandello play, ``Each in His Own
Way,'' he incorporated images of mobsters from popular culture and
dialogue filled with contemporary vernacular. The result was last
year's ``Notions in Motion,'' a gangster spoof that played with
theatrical illusion, written and directed by Dobrish in a style he
calls ``Pirandello meets Tarantino.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Notions in Motion'' was the Adobe success of which he is most
proud. ``It got high school students into the theater, and they
were screaming and shouting,'' he said. ``They might never have
been in the theater before, and suddenly they were sticking around
to talk about the play with the actors afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   Dobrish, who was a psychology and theater major in college, says
he enjoys theater that is ``accessible'' and expresses disdain for
the ``self-conscious preciousness'' that some people associate with
downtown experimental theater. ``I would often go see things Off
Off Broadway,'' Dobrish said, ``and feel like I was at a party with
the cool kids, but I wasn't really invited.''
</P>
<P>
   He mentions as influences the director Mark Brokaw (``This Is
Our Youth'') and the playwright Tony Kushner, but he is more likely
to emulate artistic directors _ Doug Aibel of the Vineyard Theater
and Neil Pepe of the Atlantic, for example _ and speaks of admiring
artists for sustaining long careers in the theater. Richard Foreman
and David Mamet, two far-flung names with whom he admits no
stylistic affinity, are to Dobrish ``heroic'' in this regard.
</P>
<P>
   He likes to call the Adobe ``a downtown theater with an uptown
sensibility.'' ``Our company believes,'' he said, ``that it's too
bad people think of Off Off Broadway as sitting trapped in some hot
basement, watching untalented actors being pretentious. Let's not
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   But will Adobe's downtown following be alienated by the move to
Off Broadway and the $45 ticket price it demands? Roberts bristled:
``Suddenly, the media notices you and wonders, `Why are you
moving?' Everyone forgets that that's the reality of the economic
mechanisms in the theater of getting your work seen. You'd never
say to a painter, `You must show that painting 20 times and then
put it in the closet and never show it again.' ''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures soared to 77 degrees at Pierre, S.D., on Tuesday, a
reading indicative of the unusual weather pattern holding across
the contiguous states. Thursday, unseasonable warmth will persist
across much of the eastern half of the nation as fast jet stream
winds from the west-southwest over the northern-tier states
continue to impede the advance of colder air from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Wet weather will again beset parts of the Pacific Northwest as
an important southward dip in the jet stream marks an active trough
of low pressure over the eastern Pacific Ocean. Moderate to heavy
rains are possible later Thursday or Thursday night in northern
California as a potent Pacific disturbance associated with the
trough moves inland. Isolated thunderstorms may accent the rain in
some areas. Prior to the arrival of the disturbance, moist onshore
winds will promote broken areas of lighter rains from western
Washington to northern California.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a renegade low pressure system in the southern branch
of the jet stream will generate showers and thunderstorms across
the southern Plains. The heaviest rains will fall across parts of
north-central and northeast Texas, Oklahoma, southeast Kansas and
western Arkansas, where moisture streaming northward from the Gulf
of Mexico is lifted by the disturbance. A few thunderstorms could
approach severe levels, but low clouds will limit heating by the
sun and thereby limit the potential for severe storms.
</P>
<P>
   Precipitation over the northern Plains will be spotty and light
because moisture will be limited.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Skip Winter
</P>
<P>
   It was as if Minnesotans skipped winter. The mercury rose to 68
degrees at the capital on Tuesday, setting a new all-time record
for December. The previous record for the month at Minneapolis was
63 degrees, set most recently in 1982. Many other locations in
central and southern Minnesota set daily and monthly records as
readings rose into the 60s. These values are typical for the first
day of autumn, rather than the last few weeks of this season when
afternoon readings should be near freezing. The warmth will persist
until the weekend when a large storm will bring back seasonal
chill.

SHARING FOOD MAY BE A GENDER THING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Tuesday Dec. 8)  
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I may be wandering into sensitive territory here, but I think
that women are more adept at sharing their food than men.
</P>
<P>
   I'm talking about collective dining,
eating-off-another-person's-plate kind of sharing.
</P>
<P>
   Simple observation proves it. At a restaurant you're more apt to
see a tableful of women passing their plates back and forth than a
tableful of men.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the men are serious foodies or have a professional
interest in sampling a menu, women seem to be more comfortable at
round-table eating where you are welcome to stick your fork into
another's plate without getting stabbed.
</P>
<P>
   This is how it works. You and, for example, five friends agree
to order six different items which you all have some interest in
tasting.
</P>
<P>
   You may be the one to lobby for the ravioli but it will not
become your personal ravioli. You may not even get to have the
first bite of it or the last. However, if the ravioli is a big
success you could get credit for making a stunning choice.
Likewise, because there's general consensus before ordering, if the
ravioli's a flop it's not your fault. Or your loss, since there are
five other dishes to eat from.
</P>
<P>
   Many women assume they'll be doing collective dining when they
go out together. It's as if every restaurant is Chinese style.
We'll just order a bunch of food and pass it around.
</P>
<P>
   But I suspect that when men go out with their men friends that
doesn't naturally happen.
</P>
<P>
   Of course I also suspect that when men go out with men they
order big steaks dripping with blood and fat and other retro food
like baked potatoes with butter and sour cream which they wash down
with brown liquor and top off with cigars. If you ask them later
what they had to eat they say pizza.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not fair to stereotype. If they did that with women
they'd have us all sipping wine spritzers and ordering dainty
salads _ dressing on the side _ arguing over the check and leaving
paltry tips.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't true with the gangs I graze with.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a good sized group you can end up experiencing a
large part of the menu. You don't have to decide on the honeyed
lamb, the calamari or the marinated duck. You can have it all. At
least guaranteed bites.
</P>
<P>
   It's like being at your own personal food tasting, minus the
sorbet in between to cleanse your palate.
</P>
<P>
   You want to choose a restaurant that understands collective
dining, one that doesn't mind that you order six appetizers, three
salads and four desserts, sometimes no entrees at all and need
extra plates.
</P>
<P>
   You can only do this with friends who also look at eating as an
adventure, who aren't worried about germs, who are flexible and
don't get upset when strange and unlike foods touch each other.
</P>
<P>
   Some people, not necessarily just men, don't like foreign
elements next to their chicken. They order chicken, they're
thinking about chicken, and chicken is all they want to taste. They
do not welcome non-chicken elements being spooned onto their plate.
These people seldom offer chicken bites and when asked will give up
the tiniest amount, grudgingly. Perhaps they grew up with a brother
or sister sitting next to them like some giant seagull, ready to
grab their last drumstick when they weren't paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   In the collective dining style you can't horde.
</P>
<P>
   You also want to make certain that no one in the group is on a
diet or has grave food prejudices and could act out if the pasta
comes with chipotle sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally you do see men and women sharing their food in
public. They sit side by side and feed each other off their forks.
But this is probably something else, a prelude to greater
intimacies. They don't count in this discussion.
</P>
<P>
   I used to think that a willingness of women to eat from
another's plate was a natural result of the mothering experience,
seeing how mothers can eat anything at anytime, no matter who's
touched it. But maybe we're just more daring in our eating habits,
more eager to challenge tradition. Or could be we're just not sure
when we'll get out to eat again so we better try it all.
</P>
<P>
   Collective dining becomes the evening's entertainment.
Participants tend to sigh and moan a lot and discuss each offering.
You also tend to eat slowly, at the same pace, respecting
everyone's butternut squash moment.
</P>
<P>
   The group effort means that eventually just about everything on
the table disappears. Waiters learn not to clear prematurely just
because there's a pause in the action.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly someone can eat this last sliver of hazelnut torte.
Here, let's cut it into sixths.

 &HT;    Life long search for the perfect Christmas confection owes its
start to parade of ants
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   My search for the perfect Christmas cookie began behind a column
of ants in an Alabama kitchen 41 years ago, before I was tall
enough to reach the countertop.
</P>
<P>
   I have no memory of it, but the domestic legend is retold
whenever several of us get together with homemade cookies on the
table. With three children under 6, my mother had time to herself
only when we slept. Projects that took more than one nap time were
considered very big deals indeed, especially if they involved
cooking _ not her favorite pastime. And so on a quiet afternoon in
December 1958, she worked quickly, cutting out and baking a whole
season's worth of sugar cookies.
</P>
<P>
   The next afternoon she dressed her Santa Clauses in
white-trimmed red suits and chocolate boots. She iced the bells
with blue, the stars with yellow and Christmas trees with green,
and topped them with sprinkles, cinnamon red hots and those silver
dragees so hard to find today.
</P>
<P>
   When I got up from my nap, she lifted me up to see them laid out
to dry on the countertop. Then she went to the bedroom to get my
sister out of her crib.
</P>
<P>
   That's when, as the story goes, I spied the ants and picked up
the pump-action ant sprayer.
</P>
<P>
   When she heard the familiar ``psst, psst, psst,'' Mama ran down
the hall crying, ``No, Marcia, no.'' She asked if I had sprayed the
cookies, but in the end she couldn't take any chances.
</P>
<P>
   She gathered up all her work, took it outside and threw it in
the trash.
</P>
<P>
   Mama doesn't know if she made more cookies that year, but
starting the next year, she let me help. All I know is I've been
baking and decorating and clipping recipes ever since, trying to
find cookies as perfect as those red-suited Santas.

 &HT;    Closing in on confection perfection
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years I've been on the trail of the perfect cookie.
</P>
<P>
   In my mind, it has just a few ingredients, ones that are easy to
find and aren't too difficult either to mix or to bake. It might be
crunchy, but it isn't necessarily chocolate. And most of all, it is
more delicious than any other.
</P>
<P>
   In my husband's mind, it's a Mallomar.
</P>
<P>
   For me, it's a Viennese Crescent _ a sublime and proportionally
superior combination of vanilla sugar, freshly mashed walnuts,
unsalted butter and flour that meets all my expectations when it's
cookie baking time.
</P>
<P>
   Cookie cutters seem to stamp out copies of themselves in my
kitchen, where every year I wonder how the stuff multiplies. There
are three cookie presses, decorating bags, cookie stamps, cutters
shaped like letters and numbers, airplanes, trucks and dogs.
Santas, angels, stars, wise men and sprucelike trees are there,
too, although one nontraditional year we decorated palm trees and
had Santa truck in the gifts.
</P>
<P>
   This year, while looking for cookies that don't contain butter _
because the price of a pound hovered around $4 _ I found a new
keeper in the gingersnaps in Elinor Klivans' new book, ``125
Cookies to Bake, Nibble and Savor'' (Broadway, $25). Klivans also
offers great tips on freezing cookies wrapped by twos in plastic
wrap and storing in metal or plastic freezer containers.
</P>
<P>
   Other cookie-baking tips:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Turn cookie sheets halfway through baking, even if you're
baking only one sheet. Ovens have hot spots, and cookies will bake
more evenly if turned.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Line cookie sheets with parchment paper, available in the
baking supplies section of most large grocery stores and at kitchen
specialty shops.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Most professionals recommend shiny, heavy-duty cookie sheets,
though I've had good results with insulated sheets. Whatever your
preference, let them cool between uses.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Unless the recipe says otherwise, chill dough before baking.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If a recipe doesn't specify how to cool the cookies, cool on
the sheets for a minute or two, then transfer to wire racks to cool
completely.

   Viennese Crescents
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 dozen crescents Preparation time: 45 minutes Cooking
time: 15-18 minutes for each sheet Standing time: overnight for
vanilla sugar
</P>
<P>
   Introductory remarks on this seemingly simple recipe caught my
eye: ``When this recipe was first published in The (New York)
Times, one food authority wrote that it was, in her opinion, the
greatest cookie recipe ever devised.'' How could I resist? Because
there are so few ingredients, use the best. Crack and chop fresh
walnuts, use a good-quality vanilla bean and the best butter you
can find.
</P>
<P>
   1/4 vanilla bean
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sifted confectioners' sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chopped walnut meats
</P>
<P>
   1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   Chop the piece of vanilla bean. Pound it in a mortar or
pulverize it in an electric blender with about 1 tablespoon of the
sugar. Mix with the remaining confectioners' sugar. Cover and let
stand, preferably overnight. Cut the walnuts with a sharp knife
into very small pieces. Pound the nuts to a paste, using a mortar
and pestle.
</P>
<P>
   When you are ready to make the cookies, preheat oven to 350
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   With a wooden spoon or your fingers, mix the walnuts, butter,
granulated sugar and flour to a smooth dough. Shape the dough,
about a teaspoon at a time, into small crescents about 1 1/2 inches
in diameter. Place an inch apart on ungreased cookie sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Bake 15-18 minutes, until lightly browned at edges. Put vanilla
confectioners' sugar in a shallow dish. Cool the cookies one minute
on the sheet, then, while they are still warm, roll them in the
vanilla sugar. Store in airtight containers for 3 days, or freeze.

   Chocolate-Tipped Butter Cookies
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 dozen cookies Preparation time: 25 minutes Cooking time:
10-12 minutes for each sheet
</P>
<P>
   This has been my sister-in-law's favorite since it was published
by Scripps Howard News Service in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup sifted confectioners' sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   2 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1 (6-ounce) package semisweet chocolate morsels
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon hydrogenated vegetable shortening
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. With electric mixer, cream butter
and confectioners' sugar until fluffy. Add vanilla. Gradually add
flour, mixing well with a wooden spoon or the hands. Dough will be
dry. Shape dough into sticks about 2 1/2 inches long, 1/2 inch wide
and 1/2 inch deep (thick). Place on ungreased cookie sheets about
an inch apart. Flatten 3/4 of each cookie lengthwise with fork to
1/4 inch thickness, leaving the patterns of the fork tines in the
dough.
</P>
<P>
   Bake 10-12 minutes, or until set but not brown. Remove to wire
racks to cool.
</P>
<P>
   Combine chocolate morsels and shortening in microwaveable dish;
microwave on high (100 percent power) 45 to 60 seconds, or until
melted. Or melt in top of double boiler or in a heavy-bottom pan.
</P>
<P>
   Put melted chocolate in a small, deep glass. Dip the thick,
plain end of each cooled cookie in chocolate mixture and let excess
drip back into the glass. Place cookies on wax paper until
chocolate is firm. Store in airtight containers between layers of
wax paper for 3 days or freeze.

   Toasted Hazelnut Shortbread Shapes Dipped in Milk Chocolate
</P>
<P>
   Makes 5 dozen Preparation time: 30 minutes Chilling time: 1 hour
Cooking time: 20 minutes each sheet
</P>
<P>
   A shortbread variation, this one is sweetened with toasted
hazelnuts and dipped in milk chocolate. Rolling the dough 1/4 inch
thick ensures the delicate cookies won't crumble when you dip them.
If you don't have heavyweight cookie sheets, reduce the baking time
and watch them closely.
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup cornstarch
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup peeled hazelnuts, toasted
</P>
<P>
   1 3/4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound plus 4 tablespoons (2 1/2 sticks) soft unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup superfine granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   Parchment paper
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon vegetable shortening
</P>
<P>
   6 ounces milk chocolate, chopped (preferably Callebaut or Dove
Bar)
</P>
<P>
   Put the cornstarch and hazelnuts in the work bowl of a food
processor fitted with the steel blade and process with a few short
bursts to combine. Process the mixture about 2 minutes, until the
hazelnuts are finely ground. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Sift the flour, baking powder and salt together. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Put the butter in a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer
on low speed for 15 seconds. Add the sugar slowly and beat on
medium speed for 2 minutes, until the mixture lightens slightly in
color and looks smooth. Stop the mixer and scrape the sides of the
bowl once during the mixing. Blend in the vanilla. Decrease the
speed to low and mix in the nuts. Add the flour mixture and beat
just until a soft dough forms. Stop the mixer and scrape the bowl
and the beaters during the mixing. Form the dough into two 6-inch
discs and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate until the dough is cold
and just firm enough to roll, about 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   Position 2 oven racks in the lower middle and upper third of the
oven. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Line 2 heavyweight baking sheets
with parchment paper.
</P>
<P>
   Remove 1 disk of dough from the refrigerator. Lightly flour the
rolling surface and rolling pin and roll the dough 1/4-inch thick.
Use a 2-inch metal cutter to cut out shapes. With a metal spatula,
transfer the cookies to the prepared baking sheets, placing them 1
inch apart. Remove the second disc from the refrigerator and
repeat. Gather the scraps together and repeat until all the dough
is used.
</P>
<P>
   Bake the cookies for up to 20 minutes, or until they are golden,
reversing the baking sheets after 10 minutes front to back and top
to bottom to ensure even baking. Cool the cookies on the baking
sheets for 5 minutes, then use a wide metal spatula to transfer
them to wire racks to cool completely.
</P>
<P>
   Put the vegetable shortening and milk chocolate in a heatproof
container and place it over, but not touching, a saucepan of barely
simmering water. Stir over the hot water until the chocolate is
melted and the mixture is smooth. Put the melted chocolate mixture
in a small, shallow bowl. Dip one side of the top of each cookie in
the chocolate and place it on the wire rack until the chocolate is
firm. Use a sweeping motion to pull one side of the cookie through
the chocolate. _ From ``125 Cookies to Bake, Nibble and Savor'' by

</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup finely chopped nuts
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup miniature semisweet chocolate pieces
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon rum flavoring, or 1/2 teaspoon almond or vanilla

</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 375 degrees. In a mixing bowl, beat butter and
shortening with an electric mixer on medium to high speed for 30
seconds. Add sugar, baking soda and salt; beat until combined. Beat
in the egg, milk and vanilla. Beat in as much of the flour as you
can with the mixer and stir in remaining flour.
</P>
<P>
   Divide dough in half. Knead the melted chocolate and nuts into
half of the dough. Knead the miniature chocolate pieces and rum or
other flavoring into the other half of the dough. Divide each of
these portions of dough in half.
</P>
<P>
   To shape dough, line the bottom and sides of a 9-by-5-by-3-inch
loaf pan with wax paper or clear plastic wrap. Press half the
chocolate dough evenly in pan. Top with half the vanilla dough,
then the remaining chocolate dough, then the remaining vanilla
dough, pressing each layer firmly and evenly over the last layer.
</P>
<P>
   Invert pan to remove dough. Peel off wax paper or plastic wrap.
Cut dough crosswise into thirds. Then turn each third and slice
crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Place cookies 2 inches apart
on an ungreased cookie sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Bake cookies about 10 minutes or until edges are firm and
bottoms are lightly browned. Transfer the cookies to a wire rack to

   A snap to bake, these snaps fill the house with a holiday scent
that beats a candle. The dough is very sticky but easier to handle
once it's rolled in sugar.
</P>
<P>
   2 1/3 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons baking soda
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup canola oil or corn oil (see note)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup molasses
</P>
<P>
   1 cup packed dark brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Use either heavy-duty cookie sheets
or insulated sheets; line sheets with parchment paper.
</P>
<P>
   Sift the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, cloves, ginger and
nutmeg together and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   In a medium bowl, put oil, molasses, brown sugar and egg. Beat
with electric mixer until smooth, about 30 seconds. Add flour
mixture and mix at low speed until incorporated.
</P>
<P>
   Put the granulated sugar in a small bowl. Drop dough (which will
be sticky) by heaping teaspoonfuls into bowl of sugar and, with
your fingertips, roll it around until it is completely covered with
sugar. Place balls on cookie sheets about 2 inches apart. Bake in
center of oven for about 8-10 minutes, turning sheet around halfway
through baking. Cookies are done when they flatten and tops crack.
Cool on baking sheet 2 minutes, then transfer to wire racks to cool
completely.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Measure oil in a measuring cup, then, without wiping out
cup, use it to measure molasses and the molasses won't stick to it.

 COX &HT;    A custardy version of pecan pie
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry

   ATLANTA _ Though Georgia home cooks probably have about as many
pecan pie recipes as cooks anywhere, not too many came through when

 &HT;    Magazine celebrates real food, real cooks _ and circulation
soars
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   From peasant fare to prix fixe feasts, the world of food is
often divided between the everyday and the gourmet. But for the
folks at upstart Saveur magazine, such a distinction is off the
mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply think `good food' and `bad food,' '' explains editor
and co-founder Colman Andrews, as he savors his first taste of
cracklin' bread at Harold's Barbecue in south Atlanta. It quickly
takes a place in his ``good food'' category.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews, who lived in Atlanta briefly in 1964, banging out
free-lance stories on a typewriter borrowed from famed Atlanta
Constitution Editor Ralph McGill, was back in town recently to
promote his magazine's new cookbook, ``Saveur Cooks Authentic
American'' (Chronicle Books, $40). It's a lush look at what we eat
in our homes and favorite restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``French fries done right are better than foie gras _ from a can
with a dent in it _ that tastes like shoe polish,'' he goes on
between the Brunswick stew and chopped pork.
</P>
<P>
   Food done right is what Saveur magazine, and now the cookbook,
is all about. And doing it right can just as often mean honoring a
tradition as perfecting a technique, with the expert as likely to
be your next-door neighbor as a celebrity chef.
</P>
<P>
   There, on Page 108 of the cookbook, renowned American chef
Jonathan Waxman shows how to stuff a whole striped bass with blood
oranges and fresh tarragon and bake it in a salt crust. Turn the
page and there's South Carolina game warden Ben Moise giving the
lowdown on a Lowcountry oyster roast, complete with the sauce that
starts with plain old ketchup.
</P>
<P>
   Both are illustrated with compelling on-location photos _ a
trademark of the magazine. There are more than 400 stunning
photographs throughout the cookbook, illustrating 175 recipes and
numerous short stories about the people, places and rituals behind
them.
</P>
<P>
   That's what makes Saveur equally at home on the coffee table and
the kitchen counter. As book or magazine, it's as engaging to
browse and read as it is to cook with.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to operate on the common wisdom that said you
have to have 100 recipes per issue, and 25 percent needed to be low
fat, and you have to review restaurants, and you have to address
health concerns,'' Andrews says.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he and co-founders Dorothy Kalins and Christopher
Hirsheimer _ all friends, foodies and journalists _ wanted a
magazine that ``reflected the way we feel'' about food, he
explains.
</P>
<P>
   One look at the publication and you know that that ``feeling''
is for food as culture, as history, as geography, as soul and
sensation. And then back again to being simply good food.
</P>
<P>
   Capturing all that means going to the rivers of Minnesota to see
the wild rice being harvested; squeezing a ``dead man's recipe''
for fried chicken out of Gus Vanderbilt, who runs a joint near
Memphis; and discerning that the burritos at H&AMP;H Coffee Shop in El
Paso, Texas, transcend all ``wrap'' trends.
</P>
<P>
   The recipes are authentic, the photographs almost always
naturally lit and presented. No glossy spreads of beautiful people
with fake laughs drinking cocktails here _ even in the book's
section on cocktails. Instead, we see real bars and real
bartenders.
</P>
<P>
   And trends? ``Oh, they say basil is out this year,'' Andrews
says. ``Well, it's been around for 3,000 years. Trends in food are
invented by people who don't want to do one thing well for a long
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see balsamic barbecue turkey wraps at Harold's,''
Andrews points out. ``You might at a lesser place.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that attitude and its reflection in Saveur _ pronounced
``sa-VUR'' and meaning flavor or taste _ that has shaken up the
food magazine business. In just three years, Saveur has won six
James Beard Awards, two National Magazine Awards and Advertising
Age's Magazine of the Year Award. Subscriptions have far surpassed
the original target of 100,000 and are now around 375,000, Andrews
says.
</P>
<P>
   That means Monte's secret is out.
</P>
<P>
   Monte Mathews is an advertising copywriter in New York who
believes the trick to entertaining a crowd is a cheap ham,
hopefully not costing more than 99 cents a pound.
</P>
<P>
   In the cookbook (and here), he shares his recipe for spiking a
smoked, bone-in ham with whole cloves, slathering it with orange
marmalade, Dijon mustard and brown sugar, then roasting it to a
crusty brown to serve to 20 or so of your favorite people.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that's food done right.

 &HT;    GORE MOCKS BUSH SLOGAN OF 'COMPASSIONATE CONSERVATISM'
 &HT;    Eds: Will be updated after 9 p.m. EST with Clinton remarks.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore, rehearsing his campaign for
the presidency, tweaked Texas Gov. George W. Bush and the
Republican Party's newly discovered ``compassionate conservatism''
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the centrist Democratic Leadership Council (DLC),
Gore said such talk reminded him of Theodoric of York, the Middle
Ages barber portrayed by comedian Steve Martin on TV's ``Saturday
Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After indulging in the most grotesque and primitive practices
in medicine or the law _ applying leeches or dunking witches in
vats of oil _ Theodoric would pause for a sudden blinding insight
and question whether we need a new enlightened approach _ whether
due process of law, or the scientific method, or the rule of
reason,'' Gore said. ``And after musing poetically about the
possibilities of the future, he'd admit: 'Naaah.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Without mentioning Bush by name, Gore gleefully noted the
similarities in the themes the Texas governor sounded in his hugely
successful re-election campaign this fall and those of President
Clinton in his 1992 campaign for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some (Republicans) now say that what we need is 'compassionate
conservatism.' They call for opportunity combined with
responsibility,'' said Gore. ``Hmmm. ...I wonder where they got
that. It sounds familiar.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``We welcome the apparent suggestion by some
Republicans that they want to move their party to the center _ that
they want to fashion their own new centrist philosophy. But we know
that there is a long road between rhetoric and results.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing differences between Democrats and Republicans on
education spending, Social Security, taxes, the environment and
crime, Gore said, ``compassion is more than a pretty word: it is
the highest of all disciplines.''
</P>
<P>
   Testing the broad themes of his campaign for the presidency in
2000, the vice president said the nation ``needs something more
than compassionate conservatism.'' He instead called for a ``new
practical idealism'' that recognizes ``our mutuality'' and moves
the country beyond ``the old polarities'' that have characterized
American politics.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton was scheduled to address the DLC on Wednesday
evening, Gore's speech was the most anticipated event of the DLC's
one-day conference because of his front-runner status for the
party's presidential nomination in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was one of the founders of the DLC, which was created after
Walter Mondale's disastrous 1984 presidential campaign. The
organization, once dismissed as a refuge for disaffected white
Southern male Democrats, is widely credited with helping to move
the Democratic Party to the political center and electing Clinton
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri, another DLC
founder and its first chairman, also addressed the gathering
Wednesday, but sounded less like a presidential aspirant than a
would-be speaker of the House. In fact, the DLC president, Al From,
introduced Gephardt with the prediction that a new Democratic House
majority would make him speaker in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt said the Democratic Party narrowed the GOP majority in
the House this fall because of ``in-touch ideas'' of ``fairness,
opportunity and responsibility'' that are relevant to people's
lives.
</P>
<P>
   The DLC also heard from Democratic Sens. John Kerry of
Massachusetts and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, both of whom are eyeing a
White House campaign in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry chastised both parties for not doing more to improve
public education. ``Democrats are viewed as defending the
indefensible, while Republicans refuse to be a part of what they
believe is indefensible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Kerrey, who lost the Democratic nomination to Clinton in
1992, warned that there is ``no easy way out'' in trying to reform
Social Security. Any plan to assure long-term financing of the
federal retirement program will be a ``tough vote'' for
politicians, he warned.

CLIBURN FOUNDATION TO STAGE AMATEUR PIANO COMPETITION
</HEADLINE>
 AMATEURS-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The people who just sit in the audience and
dream, but keep practicing the piano anyway, will have a chance to
shine in Fort Worth next summer: The Cliburn Foundation, presenter
of the world's most significant international piano competition for
professsionals, will sponsor an International Piano Competition for
Outstanding Amateurs, to be held June 9-13.
</P>
<P>
   John Giordano, music director of the Fort Worth Symphony and
chairman of the jury of the Van Cliburn International Piano
Competition, will head the jury. The jury will include Gerard
Bekerman, a professor of economics at the University of Paris who
is also the founder and president of the ``Concours des Grands
Amateurs de Piano,'' an international competition for amateur
pianists held annually in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Rodzinski, executive director of the Cliburn Foundation,
became interested in the concept because of Aniela Rubinstein, the
widow of Artur Rubinstein and a longtime friend of Rodzinski's. A
frequent member of the jury in Paris, she spoke enthusiastically to
Rodzinski of the atmosphere of the French competition.
</P>
<P>
   Rodzinski served on the jury in Paris this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful idea,'' he says. ``Its real value is that it
encourages the making of music, not just on the stage, but at home.
In Paris, it brought together a number of people who share a common
interest. Everyone played well, but winning was not the main
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The quadrennial Cliburn competition has long served as the model
for other competitions around the world, but this new amateur
competition is frankly modeled on the Parisian competition.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1989 and financially supported by Radio France and
the cultural ministry of the government of France, the French
amateur competition draws about 100 competitors every year from
around the world. The first prize is approximately $2,000, and
every five years, the first-prize winners appear in a joint concert
of concertos with orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   The frequency of the competition in Fort Worth will depend on
the success of next summer's contest. Rodzinski expects that the
funds from application fees and ticket sales will cover the cost of
the event.
</P>
<P>
   Applicants for the amateur competition in Fort Worth must be
older than 30 as of June 1, 1999, and may not earn a living as a
professional musician or music teacher. Approximately 100 pianists
will be accepted in the event, which will open with a three-day
preliminary round June 9-11 at Ed Landreth Auditorium at Texas
Christian University. Each competitor in the preliminary round will
play a 10-minute program.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 18 semifinalists will perform 20-minute programs on
June 12; six finalists will perform programs of 30 minutes on June
13. The first-prize winner will receive a cash prize of $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   There are no restrictions on repertory, and complete rules are
available from the Cliburn Foundation at (817) 738-6536.
Applications, including pertinent materials and an application fee
of $50, are due March 1, 1999, and accepted applicants will be
notified by April 15.
</P>
<P>
   The TCU/Cliburn Piano Institute, which annually hosts an
amateurs' program along with its programs for teachers and aspiring
professionals, will hold its amateurs' division on the TCU campus
June 1-9 and June 14-22, including selective auditions for a chance
to perform a concerto movement with the Fort Worth Chamber
Orchestra.

(FIXING WORDING IN 1ST LINE OF 2ND GRAF)  
 WHEN A GOLDEN-AGE WRITER DECIDED TO GO COMMERCIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Dec. 6)

<TEXT>
<P>
   The television writer and producer Rod Serling died 23 years
ago, but watching him in action today is as engrossing as taking in
one of his fanciful dramas. Maybe more so.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a fifth dimension,'' he says at the start of many
episodes of ``The Twilight Zone,'' the famed science fiction series
that ran from 1959 to 1965 and was his signature. ``It is the
middle ground between light and shadow, between science and
superstition, and it lies between the pit of man's fears and the
summit of his knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   That the words still stand as one of the more memorable
utterances of American popular culture is largely because of the
way Serling spoke them _ smoothly and resonantly, with the smug yet
winning assurance of a man with absolute knowledge of a product and
how to sell it. In fact, when he was talking to potential
advertisers about ``The Twilight Zone,'' that was exactly how he
referred to it: ``product.''
</P>
<P>
   As caught in ``Treasures of the Twilight Zone,'' a new pair of
digital video disks from Panasonic Interactive Media, Serling is a
man of both artistic and pragmatic dispositions. On the disks are
six half-hour episodes, including the pilot (``Where Is
Everybody?''), biographical material about Serling and the show,
and several features with the man strutting his stuff, so to speak,
in front of tough audiences.
</P>
<P>
   In one of these clips, called ``Pitches,'' Serling talks to
Madison Avenue about his new show. In honor of the audience,
presumably Oxford wing-tipped corporate types, the little address
begins behind a desk but soon repairs to props arranged around the
set. Serling, all faintly condescending brilliance and speaking
with that renowned punchy articulation, strides to a bucket of
sand, which he spills dramatically across a table. Slowly he sifts
some through his hand. Viewers are to imagine a desert on an
asteroid in space and the nightmarish loneliness of a man stranded
thereon.
</P>
<P>
   The presentation moves on, with Serling leaning jauntily against
a huge camera. Lightning flashes and thunder rolls. Serling puts on
that little grin. Imagine a little Faustian tale.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best part is that Serling remains rather likable.
For a fuller picture, the disks include an interview with Mike
Wallace in 1959. Wallace asks Serling, the writer of epic
television dramas like ``Requiem for a Heavyweight,'' if he is
selling out by undertaking a popular series, which will inevitably
mean concessions to advertisers and mass tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Serling replies that throughout his career, he has acquiesced in
only a few minor instances. Wallace notes that both Paddy Chayevsky
and Gore Vidal left television when it became too oppressive. Has
Serling thought about becoming a novelist? Serling disarmingly
replies that he's not sure he could make it outside television,
then defends his decision succinctly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calling something commercial isn't putting a tag on it that it
stinks,'' he says.

   The Clio, a handheld computer that arrives in stores this month,
falls somewhere between standard laptops, and the smaller Windows
CE devices. The 9.4-inch screen and nearly full-sized keyboard are
akin to a laptop, but the brains _ no hard drive, 16 megabytes of
RAM, and a MIPS processor _ are not much more than a CE would
muster.
</P>
<P>
   The $999 Clio, made by Vadem, based in San Jose, Calif., offers
one added twist, literally. Its screen is attached to the keyboard
by two aluminum arms, on which the screen can rotate top to bottom.
</P>
<P>
   This ``swing-top design,'' as Vadem calls it, allows the screen
to be put in three positions: upright in a standard computer setup;
folded atop the keyboard for use as a digital tablet (it comes with
stylus and hand-recognition software), or folded outward _ opposite
the keyboard _ so that it can be used to display presentations.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Epel, Vadem's vice president for marketing, calls the device
a ``mobile information appliance,'' leaving open the question of
whether mobile refers to the person carrying the device, or to its
screen. &QL;

   At last, a compelling reason to buy high-definition television.
</P>
<P>
   Future games of the New York Rangers hockey team, the world
champion New York Yankees, the New York Mets, and the New York
Knicks _ if professional basketball ever resumes _ are going to be
delivered to cable television subscribers in high definition next
year, according to an announcement Wednesday by the MSG Network, a
division of Cablevision Systems.
</P>
<P>
   True, the current HDTV sets are atrociously expensive, costing
many thousands of dollars. Only a relative handful of people in New
York City have bought them and only a few HDTV programs have been
broadcast. But at 1,080 lines of resolution, HDTV promises to allow
cable subscribers to see each drop of sweat as clearly as if the
viewer had court-side season tickets costing many thousands of
dollars. And cable seats are easier to get.
</P>
<P>
   The MSG Network, which began HDTV broadcasts of a few Rangers
games in late October, just purchased a pair of Lucent MPEG-2
Digital Video System encoders for its Madison Square Garden digital
cable production facility, signaling that it is serious about
regular high-definition transmissions for sports and special
events.
</P>
<P>
   But one big question remains: Is HDTV a curse on New York teams?
The Rangers have lost every HDTV game so far, and the Knicks are on
strike. Does HDTV spell doom for the Yankees next season?

   To avoid viruses in this day and age, it is advisable to be
careful when swapping floppy disks, and, perhaps before long, Web
pages too. Some companies that make virus protection software _ and
thus have a commercial interest in telling us these things _ report
they have seen a new, though rare, strain of virus notable because
it can be embedded in hypertext markup language, or HTML pages, the
documents that make up Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   So far, this virus, like most others, is not widespread and
poses no widespread danger. But the potential impact could be
significant since in theory a hard drive could get the virus simply
when a user opens an infected Web page or e-mail, said Igor
Grebert, who is a senior virus researcher at Trend Micro, a Silicon
Valley company that makes virus protection software.
</P>
<P>
   The viruses started appearing in early November, and some 20
variations have emerged, Trend Micro officials said. Many of the
viruses are not malicious, but one of them is designed to replace
``text'' files _ documents that end with ``.txt'' _ with a picture
of a naked man making a lewd gesture.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Grebert said the viruses were not particularly worrisome
at this point for several reasons, one of which was that they were
only circulating among researchers and hackers, not ``in the
wild.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The significance is that this is proof of the concept that
such a virus can live in HTML,'' he said. A further reason not to
worry is that Windows, the operating system that would be
susceptible to the viruses, has some protection built in: Before
the virus can become active, Windows will provide a prompt asking a
user whether it should execute a visual basic script, the language
in which the viruses are written. This, at least, can warn users of
a pending problem.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Cooper, the moderator of the NTbugtraq mailing list, a
discussion group of security issues affecting the Windows NT
operating system, agreed that, for now at least, the viruses are no
big deal. Although he added that the concept had the potential to
``make people wary of everything on the Net.'' ``For now,'' Cooper
said, ``I'd be more worried that people will see pornography while
surfing than that they will get a virus.'' &QL;

   Some analysts have theorized that the proposed buyout by America
Online of Netscape could put a crimp in the Justice Department's
efforts to categorize the Microsoft Corp. as the Internet's
reigning monolith. A new survey seems to back that argument.
</P>
<P>
   If the buyout goes through, Web sites owned by AOL will become
by far the most dominant gateways to cyberspace, according to the
survey by Cyber Dialogue, a New York-based Internet research firm.
</P>
<P>
   The company's report says that after an AOL-Netscape alliance,
one in every three American adults would start each Web experience
from an AOL-owned site. These sites would include AOL's proprietary
service, used by 14 million people worldwide, AOL's home page on
the Web and the Netcenter portal, which is Netscape's home page.
</P>
<P>
   That dominance won't be without challenges, however, said Thomas
E. Miller, vice president of Cyber Dialogue. In particular, he
said, AOL would have to fuse two vastly different cultures _ the
newbies and neophytes of AOL with the relatively more sophisticated
surfers who regularly log onto Netcenter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attitudes of the two audiences are really quite
different,'' Miller said. ``The challenge is going to be how to
blend them.''

GETTY CENTER CALLING ON ITS NEIGHBORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (bl) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Just about everything in the new Getty Center's
first year of operations has been larger than life, but one of the
more revealing developments at its spectacular campus here took
place quietly.
</P>
<P>
   The Getty had previously agreed to bring an exhibition on
Sigmund Freud to its campus. But several months ago Getty officials
called the nearby Skirball Cultural Center and asked if it wanted
to be the host of the exhibition, which is now at the Library of
Congress in Washington, adding that the Getty would still foot the
cost, roughly $300,000. ``They approached us, which I think was a
very important statement,'' said Dr. Uri Herscher, president of the
Skirball, which is dedicated to Jewish-American culture. It was the
first time the Getty had engaged in such a cooperative venture with
another museum here.
</P>
<P>
   When the J. Paul Getty Trust opened its $1 billion hilltop home
last Dec. 16 after 13 years of planning and construction, it was
one of the more celebrated cultural events in the nation. Visits to
the museum are running about 50 percent ahead of what had been
expected: close to 2 million people will have made the trip in the
first year, even though parking reservations have been almost
impossible to obtain, and the museum can be reached only after a
tram ride. As a result, the Getty's first new construction project
involves an additional set of restrooms.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the big numbers and public enthusiasm, the Getty, one
of the wealthiest private arts institutions in the world, has been
rethinking its mission and its role in Los Angeles. For good or for
ill, the once remote and self-contained museum is reaching out in
new ways, as it did to the Skirball, however slowly at times; it is
also turning from unfettered growth to an era of limits on what it
can do by itself.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Munitz, who was named the Getty's president and chief
executive shortly after the opening, has made it a point to
consolidate some of the trust's activities and to reach out to
other museums here. Munitz has insisted that the trust's endowment,
though close to $5 billion, could no longer be the sole source of
support and that he would be seeking corporate sponsorships as well
as donations from individuals.
</P>
<P>
   As these shifts gain momentum, three senior officials have
departed. And some of the other museums in Los Angeles have
expressed nervousness about some of the Getty's ambitions. Just
this week the Getty announced that Miguel Angel Corzo had resigned
as chief of its respected Conservation Institute. Munitz insisted
that it was just one part of an institution undergoing what he
called ``a pretty dramatic transformation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't surprise me if there were one or more resignations
down the road of senior people,'' he said. ``Inevitably that may
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Getty Trust has long been a leader in financing arts
education projects, archeological digs and conservation efforts
around the globe. It also gives roughly $7.5 million a year in arts
grants.
</P>
<P>
   But Munitz, 57, has sought to give these efforts greater muscle,
adding flesh to the initial goals he had vaguely sketched when he
took over in January after leaving his post as chancellor of the
California State University system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sort of staggered across the finish line when we opened
last year and expected we'd take some time to catch our breath, but
Barry came in with a lot of energy and a desire to move us to a
higher level,'' said Stephen Rountree, the chief operating officer
of the trust.
</P>
<P>
   Munitz, who was reared in Brooklyn, was an unexpected choice for
the job as head of the trust since he was an academic and
businessman with no experience at an arts institution. But he made
it clear from the start that he had some new ideas. He succeeded
Harold Williams, a somewhat cerebral former tax lawyer who had
presided over a decade of enormous growth when the Getty,
previously housed in a small faux-Roman villa in Malibu, was seen
as a somewhat cloistered if impressive institution.
</P>
<P>
   Eli Broad, a leading collector who helped build two other major
museums here, has worked closely with both men and said their
personal differences were being underlined by the Getty's new
directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barry, as a result of his personality and his background, is
more of a populist and he has a greater interest in serving a
broader public,'' said Broad. ``Harold's agenda was different.
Neither is right or wrong. They're just different.''
</P>
<P>
   The California State University system Munitz had headed has
long been seen as the more accessible but second-tier portion of
the state's higher education system, behind the prestigious
University of California campuses. Munitz said he made it clear to
the board that if he came to the Getty, he would push to broaden
its public mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they chose someone like me it was a profound political
statement and the board recognized it clearly,'' said Munitz, who
was also Governor-elect Gray Davis' surprise choice several week
ago to lead his transition team.
</P>
<P>
   The changes at the Getty so far have been mostly small, but
symbolic. The Getty recently opened an information kiosk at, of all
places, a shopping mall. Even when the museum cut back its
advertising because it was overwhelmed by visitors, it continued to
advertise on a local Spanish-language radio station to diversify
its audience.
</P>
<P>
   An institution that long shunned commercial partnerships, in
part because of its wealth, is now planning to allow a corporation,
Aetna, to sponsor a planned show of Degas' photography, which is
now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Munitz said he found the Getty Center's six-building campus,
designed by Richard Meier and covered in acres of honey-tone
travertine marble, quite beautiful but in practical terms
``surprisingly and unhappily inflexible.'' Thus, he said, he is
already tinkering with ways of trying to make it more adaptable.
</P>
<P>
   Many internal barriers are being taken down. Munitz initiated a
review of the Getty's many divisions that has already resulted in
the closing of its Information Institute, which was involved in
software development for the arts. About 15 people are likely to
lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a far more important symbolic break, Munitz composed his
review committees of midlevel staff members and a few outsiders.
Such policy decisions used to be the province only of top
administrators.
</P>
<P>
   The reviews also cut across the previously rigid boundaries
separating the various institutes that make up the Getty Trust,
including the Conservation Institute, which is involved in the
conservation of artworks, and the Research Institute, which has a
vast library, an online system and sponsors extensive arts
scholarships. As Munitz noted, the security cards of one institute
did not work for the others, which meant that visiting a different
area was like obtaining a visa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The institutes were all in their own worlds,'' said Jack
Meyers, a senior program officer in the Getty's grant program and a
member of the panel that reviewed the Information Institute. ``The
idea of someone immersing themselves in another area here felt
really different.''
</P>
<P>
   Given its enormous size and influence, the Getty's new activism
is also raising deep concerns in some quarters. For instance,
Munitz said he intended to seek donations of money and art from
wealthy individuals. Told of this plan, Andrea Rich, president and
chief executive of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, a major
institution with almost no endowment, said such a move would be
threatening.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a problem if they went out and competed with us
for charitable contributions and art,'' said Ms. Rich. ``It would
have an impact on this institution.''
</P>
<P>
   Told of the concerns, Munitz said he intended to work
cooperatively with other museums, but that competition for certain
extremely wealthy donors ``might be inevitable.''

   Cartoons Dare To Mock Icons
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The discipline of pop-music cartoon strips is a
small and sad one, but one of the best has always been ``Great Pop
Things.'' Running for 10 years in alternative weekly newspapers,
this pen-and-ink history of rock-and-roll has informed readers that
Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones ate so much candy that ``his
entire body rotted away from the teeth downwards,'' Madonna ``tried
to change organized religion'' by ``wearing her underwear outside
her clothes,'' Bob Dylan's music opened the way for new
singer-songwriters who ``were usually discovered feeling sorry for
themselves on the stairs at parties'' and Bono of U2 ``retired from
music to make LPs.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who don't live in the cities where the comic strip is
regularly published (Los Angeles and Chicago, mainly), this smart,
skewed, pun-filled and just plain inaccurate history of
rock-and-roll has always been out of reach. This month, its best
strips have been anthologized for the first time in the United
States as a book, ``Great Pop Things: The Real History of
Rock-and-Roll From Elvis to Oasis'' by Verse Chorus Press. (In
1992, Penguin in England released a hard-to-find anthology that the
creators weren't happy with, then retained the rights to the comics
until last year.)
</P>
<P>
   Steve Connell, who runs Verse Chorus Press and is a publisher of
the music magazine ``Puncture,'' said he was attracted to the comic
strip by ``the attitude of complete irreverence to things that are
normally approached with great reverence _ phenomena like U2
especially, which begs to be made fun of.''
</P>
<P>
   The strip is drawn by Jon Langford (of the 20-year-old rock
group the Mekons) under the pseudonym Chuck Death. A friend from
his hometown of Newport, Wales, Colin B. Morton, writes the text.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have a problem with the comic strip,'' Langford
said. ``Morrissey picked up a copy and threw it across the room and
said his chin was too big. He was quite angry. But others,
especially less popular bands, have used the comic as a T-shirt and
view being included in it as an honor.''
</P>
<P>
   The criteria for being included in ``Great Pop Things'' are
usually arrogance, a lack of self-awareness and being a pop-culture
phenomenon, which has made for lots of comics about Morrissey,
Madonna and U2.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Morrissey, U2 has never responded to the barbed, mocking
insults the comic has hurled at them. ``That's one of the things
that gall me,'' Langford said. ``We relentlessly pillory them for
being one of the most obnoxious and pompous of rock bands. But
they've never gotten back to us. I'm sure they could break our legs
if they wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   The strip originally ran in Record Mirror in England in 1988
and, according to Langford, his inspiration has never ebbed. ``Just
when we think we've run out of ideas, David Bowie will say he's
going to relaunch `Ziggy Stardust,''' he said. ``Or the Sex Pistols
will reform and we'll go, `Wow, we can get five strips out of that;
that's like 500 bucks.' There's no bounds to the ridiculousness of
pop people.''
</P>
<P>
   But does Langford feel hypocritical in making fun of all these
popular and semipopular musicians when he is one himself? ``They've
got more money than me, but they're not as good-looking or
talented, so I should ridicule them,'' he explained, not without
sarcasm. ``So it was partially inspired out of greed and hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   R-and-B Awards
</P>
<P>
   The Rhythm-and-Blues Foundation announced the recipients of its
annual Pioneer Awards on Wednesday. They include Johnny Adams, the
New Orleans singer who died this year; Garnet Mimms, the leader of
the Enchanters whose songs have been most famously interpreted by
Janis Joplin; Mickey Baker, the prolific session guitarist; Brenda
Holloway, the Motown singer; Dee Dee Warwick, the sister of Dionne;
Patti LaBelle and the Bluetones, whose original lineup will be
reunited at the awards ceremony for the first time since 1967; the
Manhattans and members of the Drifters.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, John Lee Hooker, now in his 50th year recording
music, will receive a lifetime achievement award.
</P>
<P>
   The awards ceremony and performances will be at Sony Studios
here, with Smokey Robinson as host, on Feb. 25, a date
strategically planned for the day after the Grammy Awards. This
way, rhythm-and-blues music can borrow some of the fanfare from the
popular music that has borrowed so much from it. Unlike the
Grammys, however, recipients of the Pioneer Award receive not just
recognition and a piece of molded metal but also a fat check:
$15,000 for individuals, $20,000 for groups. This year, the
foundation is giving away $260,000, a sum that Janis Hazel, the
foundation's new executive director, describes as ``an all-time
whopper.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, she said, the foundation has focused on its
education project, creating a 26-part radio series on
rhythm-and-blues planned to run on National Public Radio next year
and working on bringing music education programs to schools. The
foundation has also continued its drive to make sure music pioneers
with a legacy but little money to show for it (thanks chiefly to
bad record deals) have what they need. It helped pay medical and,
ultimately, funeral expenses for one of this year's honorees,
Adams.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation started 10 years ago with seed money from Ahmet
Ertegun of Atlantic Records, but recently it has been forced to get
more creative in its search for funds, which may be one reason
Ronald Perelman, the chairman of Revlon and a rhythm-and-blues fan,
will be presiding over this year's ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy has shrunk, the music industry is tightening its
belt,'' Ms. Hazel said. ``We need to seriously fund-raise in order
to continue with our programs so we have been looking at other
industries like automobile and major appliance manufacturers that
use R-and-B in their advertisements.''

LEWINSKY'S BOOK DEAL SMACKS OF DESPERATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of this, we may be certain: Monica Lewinsky's book deal smacks
of desperation.
</P>
<P>
   St. Martin's Press will publish ``Monica's Story'' in February.
Lewinsky's co-author, a snappier title than ``ghost writer,'' will
be Andrew Morton, best-known for writing the bestselling ``Diana:
Her True Story'' with considerable input from the princess. For
baring her soul to the world about baring the rest of herself to
Bill Clinton, Monica picks up a reported $600,000 plus ``bonuses
for bestseller rankings.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't think for a minute that Lewinsky is unconditionally
thrilled. From who is publishing the book to who is helping
Lewinsky write it to the money she's being paid, the literary tea
leaves are impossible to misinterpret.
</P>
<P>
   Start with St. Martin's Press, Monica's American publisher. Yes,
the deal was supposedly put together by Britain's O'Mara Books,
which will publish ``Monica's Story'' in the rest of the world, but
by all reports the rest of the world is unconcerned with
presidential peccadilloes. For ``Monica's Story,'' financial
success hinges on U.S. sales.
</P>
<P>
   St. Martin's is known for churning out quickie titles. From
David Koresh to O.J. Simpson, if there's a sensational murder or
spicy scandal, St. Martin's will probably be the first to weigh in,
usually with a superficial quick hit designed to grab a few bucks
before the fickle public turns its attention to something else.
Signing with St. Martin's is a flat-out admission by Monica and/or
her advisers that her book needs to hit stores ASAP.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because it's increasingly obvious that most Americans are
sick of the whole Lewinsky business and that impeachment
proceedings against Clinton are unlikely to be the drawn-out affair
(pun intended) they seemed certain to be just a few months ago.
Back then, Monica &AMP; Co. wanted a lot more than $600,000 to spill
her guts in print. But the recent national elections shot down more
than Newt Gingrich; any publishing company's belief that countless
outraged Americans would snap up Monica's book vanished, too.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Monica's Story'' comes out in December 1999 instead of
February, it might just as well be stuck straight in the $1 bargain
bins. So St. Martin's became the perfect publisher; in this
situation, speed counts more than quality.
</P>
<P>
   Morton's involvement is further proof of sales desperation.
Among the many celebrity flavors-of-the-month over the past silly
decade or so, Princess Diana is one of the few who retained
long-term icon status. St. Martin's has to hope _ pray _ that
enough people still link Morton's name with the Diana book to buy
anything else he writes about a poor lost girl suffering through no
fault of her own.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the money. Just weeks ago, solid
publishing-industry scuttlebutt had Monica close to signing a $2.2
million deal with a much more prestigious publisher. Six hundred
thousand may seem like plenty to the rest of us, but as a
celebrity's book advance, it's less than tip money. Don't be too
impressed by the add-on bestseller bonus. ``Monica's Story'' will
undoubtedly be a bestseller for two, maybe three weeks, until the
easily titillated have bought their copies. ``Rankings'' is the key
word in the money end of the agreement. It could easily mean that
``Monica's Story'' would have to end up among 1999's top 10 sellers
to earn her an extra penny. It won't.
</P>
<P>
   If it's any consolation to Lewinsky, her scaled-down deal will
still eclipse anything Linda Tripp will get. And even if ``Monica's
Story'' sells better than expected, its success will still pale
against the numbers racked up by the Clinton book that everyone
will want to read no matter when it is published _ the White House
memoirs of Hillary Rodham Clinton. .MDBU/.MDNM/ (Visit the

According to state records, new millionaire Kenny Dukes, who also

four times since the late 1970s and will be on parole until July
2001 for burglary. Records show he also has been charged in

   CARE _ ATLANTA _ Fifty years ago, the relief organization CARE
delivered boxes of food and supplies to grateful Europeans
struggling to recover from the ravages of World War II. But CARE
could never get away today with doing what they did then. Those
boxes contained peanut butter, which was alien to the native
population. They contained candy, which is not nutritious. And they
contained cigarettes, which damage health. Today, aid workers
realize that aid can hurt the people it is intended to help. It can
foster dependency. It can help fuel a war, as in Sudan. Camps that
save refugees can also harbor killers, as in Rwanda. So as CARE
begins work in Honduras and Nicaragua, it is working hard to
deliver aid in an effective and non-harmful way. (Melvin, Atlanta

the scientists who conducted the DNA study on Count Casmir Pulaski

IN THE HEARTLAND, A CORNUCOPIA OF CULTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Minn., Texas)  (For release Sunday, Dec. 6)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   PEORIA, Ill. _ When Richard Nixon asked, ``Will it play in
Peoria?'' he was taking the nation's temperature, checking on the
predilections of mainstream citizens. But he was also reviving an
adage from the early part of the century, when this city was a
center of whiskey production and an active vaudeville circuit stop,
and the farm folks were renowned as a particularly dour and
tough-to-please audience.
</P>
<P>
   When I echoed the question last month _ what I actually said
was: ``So what plays in Peoria?'' _ the occasion was a round-table
discussion, organized at the request of The New York Times, among
representatives of local arts groups. The subject was the health of
the arts in this conservative heartland city of 113,000 people on
the Illinois River. And it was with the emblematic history of
Peoria in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wondered how long it would take you to ask,'' said the
mayor, Bud Grieves. ``We get that a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Best known today, perhaps, as the headquarters of Caterpillar
Inc., the heavy-equipment manufacturer, Peoria, a three-hour drive
southwest of Chicago, has exported a healthy regiment of cultural
troops: comedians Richard Pryor and Sam Kinison, pop singer Dan
Fogelberg and actors Susan Dey and Tom Irwin, not to mention Betty
Friedan.
</P>
<P>
   But even with them long removed _ and casting aside the
gimmickry of my journalistic conceit _ the city still serves as an
adequate emblem of the nation's cultural health. Which is to say,
there is a lot more going on than you might expect.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor had joined officials from the Peoria Symphony, the
Peoria Players Theater, the Peoria Ballet, Opera Illinois and a
dozen or so others on the second floor of a once-abandoned
warehouse on the city's developing riverfront that a young
entrepreneur has successfully transformed into a dinner theater.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, they wanted to brag on themselves, with some reason. All
the nonprofits at the table, even the opera, were at least breaking
even. That week, the city-owned Peoria Civic Center was presenting
the music of both Mahler and Motley Crue. The Peoria Arts Guild,
which exhibits the work of regional artists and each summer
sponsors an art fair that attracts thousands of visitors, was
preparing to move, with the help of a $1 million gift from a local
patron, to a new building near the river, one more addition to what
is becoming a bona fide cultural district.
</P>
<P>
   The schools have maintained a modest budget for arts
instruction. And as Grieves pointed out, for 60 years the citizenry
has upheld, through a referendum, a tax to support twice-weekly
summer concerts by the Peoria Municipal Band.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is not the whole story; there is much that
doesn't play in Peoria. But it is worthwhile to pause here and
consider the good news, because in the continuing public discourse
about the state of the nation's cultural life, the good news
doesn't seem be heard much.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, mostly because of the well-publicized struggle of the
National Endowment for the Arts to remain alive and viable, it
seems fair to say the prevailing perception is that the arts in
America are suffering, that the nation's cultural life has
diminished, that the artistic side of the American character is
undernourished. The endowment had its budget reduced by Congress
from $176 million in 1992 to the current $98 million, and, even
though its Congressional support seems to have stabilized in recent
months, its role as grantmaker has been decried by conservatives
because of its support for a handful of controversial projects.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in its own report on the state of the arts in this
country, ``American Canvas,'' the endowment sounded an ominous
note, describing the arts as undersupported by the public, and the
arts community as insufficiently engaged with society as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   That report was released 14 months ago, about the same time this
newspaper gave me the assignment to travel the country and write
about the arts as they are practiced and appreciated outside New
York. In that time, I have visited 40 cities, my own personal
American canvas, and my impression is that far from being dormant
or in retreat, the arts, on balance, are edifyingly, thrillingly
abloom. Virtually everywhere. The quantity of activity in any given
community has surprised me almost every time, and more often than
not I was surprised by its quality as well.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have suspected that in Bozeman, Mont., a city of
35,000 people, there are some 75 arts organizations? Or for that
matter, that in Peoria and its surrounding counties there are more
than 50, including an orchestra, now in its 101st season, that is
the 15th-oldest in the United States and that drew some 1,500
people to hear Mahler's Fourth Symphony last month, its tricky,
exposed solos in the middle movements handled with delicacy by the
horns and woodwinds.
</P>
<P>
   Frequently, I would visit a place to see something or someone
specific, and while there come upon a trail of breadcrumbs leading
irresistibly to something or someone else. In El Paso, I found a
Chicano artists cooperative, painters, sculptors and musicians
squatting _ with permission _ in the shell of an old furniture
store, enlivening a struggling neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, I was
introduced, by Richard Flood, the chief curator there, to Christi
Atkinson, who runs No Name Exhibitions, a group of more than 100
local artists in the midst of renovating an old soap factory. The
building was only partly spiffed up; it might be 10 years before
the renovation is complete, Ms. Atkinson said. But already artists
were working in studios, and several shows had been mounted, even
though the place doesn't have heat yet.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   I never thought to find _ who would? _ an amateur production of
``The Marriage of Figaro'' in the woods of mid-coast Maine. Nor did
I expect a riverfront concert in Des Moines by the Kabbalas, an
Iowa-based rock band with a sound that is part Middle Eastern, part
electric klezmer and part Spike Jones. In Sacramento, I stumbled on
Fred Rochlin, a 74-year-old retired architect who had just begun a
second career _ as a monologist.
</P>
<P>
   This is hardly scientific evidence of anything, true. But these
anecdotal examples (and dozens of others) of arts activity in
disparate places, often underfinanced and almost always beneath the
radar of the media, have reminded me that the impulse toward art _
making it and appreciating it _ is irrefutably potent.
</P>
<P>
   And here are some numbers to underscore my impression. In a
survey released in September, the endowment reported that in 1997,
20 million Americans sang in choirs or other groups; 33 million
took photographs for artistic purposes; 24 million wrote creatively
for reasons other than school or work, and 22 million played
classical music on some instrument or other.
</P>
<P>
   The same year, 5 million Americans acted on a public stage. And
97 million, fully half the adult population of the United States,
attended at least one of the following events: a museum exhibit, a
jazz performance, an opera, a classical music concert, a stage
musical, a play or a ballet. In terms of percentage, that is up
from 41 percent of adults who attended arts events in 1992, the
last time the survey was conducted. (And it is worth noting that
this number does not include those who saw a movie, read a novel or
played in a garage band.)
</P>
<P>
   The numbers suggest that our arts institutions have begun to
address _ successfully _ the problem of integrating themselves into
their communities. More educational programs, more children's
programming, more outreach: all of this has emphasized the good the
arts can do, focusing attention on what Ben Cameron, the executive
director of the Theater Communications Group in New York, an
umbrella organization for nonprofit theaters, calls ``the value
rather than the quality'' of art.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in many cities, Peoria included, arts institutions
continue to worry about aging audiences. Minority groups still
complain about feeling unwelcome in theaters and concert halls
where, beyond the occasional token production, programming rarely
reflects their interests and where, at the same time, traditional
programmers feel frustrated at being unable to attract minority
audiences, despite what they feel are their best efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a minority marketing committee but I'll be frank, we
have really struggled,'' said Debbie Ritschel, the marketing
director of the Peoria Civic Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our African-American community works very well within its own
community, but we can't seem to get them here.'' Last year, she
added, ``An Evening With Langston and Martin,'' a theatrical
presentation about the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Langston
Hughes, sold only 125 tickets, even though it had considerable star
power, with Danny Glover as the renowned poet of the Harlem
Renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   Stan Maclin, who performs in an African drumming troupe that is
based in Peoria, pointed out that in this city, which is 70 percent
white, ``most people who look like me don't attend meetings like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't usually invited,'' he said. ``It's overwhelming. If
you don't know how to get the audience, it's because you've created
a situation where you feel you can participate but we don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the fact that minority attendance has recently climbed
nationwide in museums, opera houses and theaters is an indication
that some people who were not showing up in these places in the
past are doing so now.
</P>
<P>
   An annual survey of nonprofit theaters, for example, compiled by
the Theater Communications Group, indicated that in 1997, 17.2
million people attended a performance at one of 197 nonprofit
theaters in the nation. That is 160,000 more people than the survey
counted a year before, which is even more impressive considering
that 31 fewer theaters participated in the survey this year.
</P>
<P>
   Further, while it is true that society still marginalizes some
outre artists and audiences, even the margins yield a kind of
optimism. Did you know that in August, 1,300 people attended the
National Poetry Slam in Austin, Texas, testimony to an almost
entirely unacknowledged new art form that is being nurtured in
coffeehouses and bars in almost every city in the country? I don't
even know what to call it _ performance poetry? competitive poetry?
_ these spoken-verse contests rooted for and hooted at as though
they were football games.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a mix of people involved, people off the street,
dissatisfied M.F.A. students,'' said Guy LeCharles Gonzalez, a New
Yorker who, representing the Nuyorican Poets Cafe on the Lower East
Side of Manhattan, was a member of this year's championship team in
Austin. ``We have some people involved in the so-called legit
journals, too, but the lifeblood is people who feel they don't have
a voice elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly enough, Gonzalez, 29, works as the membership
coordinator for the Academy of American Poets, which is at the very
center of the establishment, and whose president, Jonathan Galassi,
once dismissed slam poetry as ``karaoke.'' Gonzalez also runs a
Monday night series of readings at 13 Bar Lounge in Greenwich
Village. ``Obviously, we're not recognized by the establishment as
a legitimate form, so funding sources that are there for others are
not there for us,'' he said. ``But if the NEA fell apart tomorrow,
these coffee shops would still have readings.''
</P>
<P>
   For the purposes of many arts groups, of course, the NEA has
already fallen apart; it is impossible to know how many groups
disappeared when their Federal grant money did. But less publicized
is that local and state governments are supporting the arts at
record levels. Part of the reason for this is that the arts have
become such proven economic generators that countless communities
have, in the last few years, applied public funds to the
construction of arts facilities in order to spur redevelopment of
benighted neighborhoods. Places as different (and unexpected) as
Las Vegas and Madison, Wis., have begun creating strategies for
developing cultural tourism.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In another economic trend, in spite of concerns that the decline
in federal grantmaking to the arts would spur a dwindling of
corporate grantmaking as well, that hasn't exactly happened.
</P>
<P>
   Though a triennial survey released in November by the Business
Committee for the Arts, an organization in New York that encourages
and tracks partnerships between businesses and arts groups,
reported that the percentage of American businesses contributing to
the arts dropped to 39 percent last year, from 45 percent in 1994,
the total contributed amount rose to an estimated $1.2 billion last
year, from $875 million three years earlier. Further, and since
1994, when half of corporate arts financing derived from the
Northeast and the West Coast, the money is now more evenly
distributed.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 60 percent of corporate arts financing came from the
South and the Midwest, which is particularly significant because
almost all corporate contributions to the arts are made locally,
and nearly half of the businesses surveyed made contributions to
small or emerging arts groups.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even as Congress, in its snubbing of the endowment, has
refused to acknowledge the importance of the arts to Americans, the
corporate community has done the opposite, according to the IEG
Sponsorship Report, a Chicago publication that tracks corporate
sponsorships of all types: more than one-third of corporate arts
contributions originate not from corporate foundations or
charitable contributions funds but from marketing budgets. Clearly,
businesses believe an affiliation with the arts helps instill
public confidence.
</P>
<P>
   But does it help sell, say, chocolate cake?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, sure it does,'' said John Bryan, the CEO of Sara Lee
Corp., which recently received a presidential arts medal for its
arts support.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a couple of reasons the arts are especially
effective for corporations. One is the opportunity to identify with
the quality image that the cultural aspects of our lives project.
Our business is a simple one of creating value by building brands,
and to a large extent this happens in the art world. The name on a
painting tells you, `This is an original thing.' It gives you trust
in that bit of art, even though it may not be obvious to you why
this piece is better than another. The name gives you confidence.
The same is true of a brand. So identifying with art is a fantastic
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some would question the value of reveling in the
corporate sponsorship of art. After all, if art is a mere
commodity, if it is so unchallenging as to be popular, if it is fit
for mass consumption, then perhaps it is uncertain why we value art
and artists in the first place. Isn't art supposed to be
provocative? Thorny? Difficult? Art is, by nature, independent,
unbeholden to commerce; as arts organizations increase their
reliance on corporate support, and increase their solicitation of
it, such independence may be threatened.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one of the often heard complaints now is that artists
and arts institutions are in retreat from controversy, a concession
to the indignant conservatism that at the beginning of this decade
undermined the National Endowment for the Arts, alienated the
public and chilled private support. Artists, the argument
continues, have conceded as well to a complacent national audience
that won't pay to be challenged, only to be entertained.
</P>
<P>
   This is a reasonable concern, but whether, over all, Americans
have access to as much controversial, experimental art as they once
did is difficult to measure. So is the relative worthiness of the
art we are producing. Does more participation in the arts result in
more great art being created? Or does it inevitably attenuate our
standards? I'm not touching that.
</P>
<P>
   What is true, certainly, is that in most of the country, art is
not being made for export; what is created stays home. And for that
reason, it is subject to home rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't like to see their friends and neighbors in
controversial roles,'' said Ginny Andrews, a board member of the
Peoria Players Theater, a community group now in its 80th season of
admittedly fluffy fare. ``They'll accept it from a touring company,
but not from us.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not an altogether terrible thing; it is one reason for
places like New York, so artists who get weary of the outlook in
Peoria have a place to go. And in my experience, most places, from
time to time, will surprise you with their tolerance, if not their
enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   They have never had Tony Kushner's play ``Angels in America: A
Gay Fantasia on National Themes'' in Peoria, which is what you
might expect, but a production of its first half, ``Millennium
Approaches'' was well received last month at Illinois State
University in Bloomington, 40 miles away. Two years ago, the
Lakeview Museum here had a Robert Mapplethorpe photography exhibit,
which caused no stir at all. ``On the other hand, I can't say the
room was overworked,'' said Pat Barton, the museum board president.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 14 months, I have seen a lot of theater, opera,
painting, dance, orchestral music, jazz, blues and rock-and-roll.
Some of it has been terrible. But much of it was not, performing
valuable service in its community. And if I have learned anything
in my travels thus far, it is that I have only scratched the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``People pay attention to certain places, New York, Chicago, as
if they're the center of the world,'' said Preston Jackson, a
sculptor who teaches at the Chicago Art Institute but whose studio
is on the Peoria riverfront. ``They're not. There's a healthy art
scene in Springfield. There's one here. Benton Harbor, Mich.,
that's another hot spot. People who want to see art should get up
and travel a little bit.''

   ``A book must be the ax for the frozen sea inside us,'' wrote
Kafka to a friend, but the holiday gift books rounded up below seem
unwieldy for Kafka's purpose. Think of them instead as conversation

   `HOW TO SKIP STONES: AND 43 MORE OF LIFE'S FORGOTTEN PLEASURES.'
Cover design by Matt Adamec. (97 pages. Hyperion. Paperback.
$9.95.) Or how to fly a kite, catch a snowflake on your tongue,
take a nap, tickle, fish, be spontaneous. It isn't the instructions
that matter so much here in this booklet that was published in
hardcover last year with the title ``Balance''; for instance, how
you give a foot massage is: 1. ``Find someone with feet.'' 2. ``Rub
firmly, deliberately pushing outwardly with thumbs. (No
tickling.)'' 3. ``Beg recipient to return favor.'' What counts are
the reminders of the simple silly things you used to do before life
got complicated.

   `THE SPORTING NEWS SELECTS BASEBALL'S 100 GREATEST PLAYERS: A
CELEBRATION OF THE 20TH CENTURY'S BEST.' By Ron Smith. Foreword by
Willie Mays. (224 pages. The Sporting News Publishing Co. $29.95.)
Ruth is No. 1, of course. And Nos. 2 through 6, reasonably enough,
are Mays, Cobb, Walter Johnson, Aaron and Gehrig. But Williams No.
8, Musial 10 and DiMaggio 11? Pete Rose as low as 25 and Mark

   `ONE DIGITAL DAY: HOW THE MICROCHIP IS CHANGING OUR WORLD.'
Created by Rick Smolan and Jennifer Erwitt. Designed by Tom Walker.
(223 pages. Times Books/Random House in association with Against
All Odds Productions. $40.) Two hundred photos illustrating how the
microchip is taking over our lives, from Istanbul, where a magic
decoder ring will pay your subway fare, to Tokyo, where a $3,500
toilet will warm its seat to your liking. Granted, it's a
book-length ad for Intel Corp., which sponsored the project; still,
it entertainingly shows how the world is turning into a computer
game.
</P>
<P>
   `SAVEUR COOKS AUTHENTIC AMERICAN.' By the editors of Saveur
Magazine. (320 pages. Chronicle Books. $40.) No matter what the
recipes here may produce, the results appear irresistible in this
pictorial celebration of American regional cooking. Even the
macaroni and cheese, made with good old Wisconsin cheddar, looks
like a gourmet special.
</P>
<P>
   `THE PRINCE OF EGYPT: A NEW VISION IN ANIMATION.' By Charles
Solomon. (192 pages. Harry N. Abrams. $45.) A sumptuously
illustrated how-they-did-it look behind the scenes of the
forthcoming Dreamworks animated musical version of ``The Ten
Commandments,'' complete with the Burning Bush, the Ten Plagues and
the parting of the Red Sea. Barring too many lines like ``Hey,
Ramses, how would you like your face carved on a wall?,'' the film,
with its lifelike animation, should be worth seeing if it lives up
to the power of this preview.

   Just in case you missed any, these two books sum up in words and
pictures the peaks and disasters of the past hundred years. One,
`THE AMERICAN CENTURY,' by Harold Evans, with Gail Buckland and
Kevin Baker (712 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $50.), says it was not
inevitable that the era should have been an American one, and
examines just how it turned out to be. The other, `THE CENTURY,' by
Peter Jennings and Todd Brewster; photographs edited by Katherine
Bourbeau (606 pages. Doubleday. $60.), a companion to the ABC News
and the History Channel television series of the same name, strives
with considerable success to give a documentary sense of what the
times were like.
</P>
<P>
   `CARTIER: THE TANK WATCH.' By Franco Cologni. With a Catalog of
Watches From 1917 to the Present by Dominique Flechon. (263 pages.
Flammarion. $75.) So ubiquitous has been the tank watch _ designed
by Louis Cartier in 1917, named after the Renault tank whose
modernistic design inspired it and presented to General Pershing in
1918 _ that Rudolph Valentino even wore one while playing in ``The
Son of the Sheik.'' This elegant volume tracks the watch's life and
times and accounts for why its design, even for those of us who
can't afford one, has become as familiar as the back of our, uh,
naked wrist.
</P>
<P>
   `JACKSON POLLOCK.' By Kirk Varnedoe with Pepe Karmel. (336
pages. Museum of Modern Art, New York. Distributed by Harry N.
Abrams. $75.) The accompanying volume to the major Pollock
exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan, this includes
more than 200 color reproductions and traces the development of the
pioneering abstract expressionist. Like great jazz music, Pollock's
radically experimental drip paintings seem with the passage of time
increasingly classic.
</P>
<P>
   `JACQUES HENRI LARTIGUE, PHOTOGRAPHER.' Introduction by Vicki
Goldberg. (288 pages. Bulfinch Press/Little, Brown and Company.
$95.) A charming monograph on Lartigue, the first book to survey
the French photographer's work in depth since ``Diary of a
Century,'' edited by Richard Avedon, was published in the 1970s.
Lartigue, in his fascination with kites, airplanes, cars and
motorcycles, captured a world defying gravity. As Ms. Goldberg, a
contributor on photography and the arts to The New York Times,
writes in her introduction, ``History provided him with a
cornucopia of inventions, including a camera with a fast lens, and
he responded with the passions of a child and the eye of an
adult.''

<P>
   Is New York still the tallest city in the world? You'll have
little doubt after viewing these two spectacular photo collections,
one looking up at the great city, the other down: `NEW YORK
VERTICAL,' by Horst Hamann, (165 pages. Te Neues Publishing
Company. $98. Also available in reduced format, $29.95), in which
each of the 66 tall black-and-white pictures is accompanied by a
telling comment like the one by Winka Dubbeldam, an architect,
``The only city where the sky is not the limit.'' And `NEW YORK
FROM THE AIR,' photographs by Yann Arthus-Bertrand, text by John
Tauranac (159 pages. Harry N. Abrams. $45.), where the city's
familiar buildings appear so cleanly bathed in golden light that
you feel almost sorry for all of us who must view them from the
ground.

   PLUNDERED-ART (Undated) -- World Jewish Congress accuses the

HEAD OF BRITISH AUTOMAKER RESIGNS AS CUTS ARE ANNOUNCED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany)  (mk) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The chairman of Rover Group, a subsidiary of Germany's
BMW AG, stepped down Wednesday, saying he felt ``quite strongly
that somebody has to be prepared to stand up and be counted'' for
the company's failure to make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   The resignation of Walter Haselkuss _ whom BMW had appointed as
chairman of Rover _ came as the British automaker disclosed
proposals for job cuts, innovative working hours, government aid
and new investment intended to propel the company into
profitability.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was made two days after Volvo AB, the Swedish
maker of cars, buses, trucks and construction equipment, said it
planned layoffs of 5,300 workers _ 7 percent of its work force _
reflecting worries among European automakers about a slowdown in
global markets.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when Britain is locked in dispute with other members
of the European Union, particularly Germany and France, about
proposals to ``harmonize'' some European taxes, BMW's rescue
strategy _ based on the flexible work-hours system used at its
plants in Germany _ offered a vivid example of how businesses are
establishing Europe-wide practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the British auto industry can't go along with this, it's a
very bad sign about the industry going forward,'' said Nick Snee,
an analyst with J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   BMW bought Rover from British Aerospace in 1994 and has been
constantly frustrated by the unit's inability to make a profit in
the high-margin British auto market.
</P>
<P>
   Haselkuss, who has been with BMW for 22 years, had taken a high
profile in recent months, contending that the strong British pound
undermined Rover's exports and exposed it to cheaper imports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The British car market is profitable, but part of that is
because the pound is very strong,'' Snee said. ``Cars made in
France and sold in Britain make a profit, but Rover is losing
money. Part of Rover's problem has been that the pound has been so
strong that imports are cheaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Haselkuss will be replaced by Werner Samann, another executive
with 22 years of service at BMW. For the last six years, he has
been head of the BMW engine and chassis division.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the change at the top, BMW also announced proposals
Wednesday to cut 2,500 jobs from Rover's work force of 39,000 and
to introduce a system of flexible work hours based on a four-day,
35-hour week.
</P>
<P>
   The BMW system allows the company to pay standard wages for
overtime, including night and Saturday shifts, when demand is high.
But it also permits workers to collect up to 200 overtime hours to
be taken as time off when demand is low. The current workweek at
Rover is 37 hours over five days plus paid overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The new system is similar to the work schedule at BMW plants in
Germany, where the company says it produces flexibility and
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   BMW also offered to invest $3.2 billion more in the company
provided the British government comes up with financial aid,
reportedly worth $400 million, for the development of new models.
There was no immediate guarantee of aid from British officials, who
largely welcomed the plan. A key part of the deal is that it will
insure the continued use of Rover's biggest plant, at Longbridge
near Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders urged Rover's workers to accept the proposals when
they vote on them later this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The work force cannot afford to reject it,'' Ken Jackson, a
union leader, said. BMW executives said the proposals would save
$247 million a year by 2000 _the date BMW has set for pushing Rover
into profit.

CHINA DEFENDS ARREST OF PROMINENT DISSIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ In response to criticism from home and abroad, Chinese
officials broke their silence Wednesday to defend their arrest this
week of a prominent dissident who was trying to form an opposition
political party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Xu Wenli is suspected of involvement in activities damaging to
national security and has violated relevant criminal codes of the
People's Republic of China,'' said a statement from the Foreign
Ministry, which on Tuesday declined to comment on the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden arrest on Monday night of Xu, as well as several
other activists involved with him in trying to form the China
Democratic Party, set off strong protests from human rights groups,
other Chinese dissidents and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view his detention for peacefully exercising fundamental
freedoms guaranteed by international human rights instruments as a
serious step in the wrong direction,'' State Department spokesman
James P. Rubin said in Washington on Tuesday. &UR;  &LR;  U.S. officials in
Beijing urged the government to release Xu and asked for
clarification as to the exact nature of his crime.
</P>
<P>
   China signed the International Covenant of Civil and Political
Rights with great fanfare in October, and Xu's arrest is seen by
human rights groups as a test of the nation's commitment to its
tenets.
</P>
<P>
   Dissidents in and out of China rose to Xu's defense, with more
than a dozen activists around the country announcing that they
would begin fasts in support of Xu and another leader of the China
Democratic Party, Qin Yongmin, who was arrested in his home in
Wuhan on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 200 dissidents signed a letter to the Chinese government
protesting the detentions, said the Information Center for Human
Rights and Democratic Movement in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Three other Democratic Party organizers were also detained on
Monday, although two of them were released early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the two more prominent dissidents, Xu and Qin, are likely to
face a much longer haul since both have been charged with
``criminal acts.''
</P>
<P>
   Xu's wife, He Xintong, said Wednesday night that she had still
not been informed of the specific charge against her husband,
although she surmised from the aggressive behavior of the arresting
officers that the sentence ``could be long.''
</P>
<P>
   Qin's family was told that he was charged with ``plotting to
subvert the government,'' a crime that for serious offenses
commands sentences of three years to life.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the Chinese criminal code, this charge comes under a grab-bag
section called ``threatening state security,'' which makes almost
any political activity that questions or hampers the authority of
the Communist Party illegal, from ``violent or nonviolent
activities aimed at overthrowing the government authorities,'' to
``activities designed to change the basic nature of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Xu's and Qin's trouble almost certainly stems from their efforts
to gain recognition for the China Democratic Party, a loose network
of pro-democracy activists in more than a dozen cities around China
that was formed this year.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six months they have become increasingly aggressive
and defiant in their attempts to register the party with the
government, submitting repeated applications even after local
authorities had declared the concept of an opposition party
illegal. They say the Chinese Constitution does not specifically
forbid the formation of new political parties, although there have
been no new parties since the founding of the People's Republic in
1949.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the by-laws of the China Democratic Party are fairly
tame; they carefully acknowledge the central role of the Communist
Party, but also support free speech and free elections for public
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband thought the time was right to begin working to form
a new party, since China recently signed the covenant on human
rights,'' Ms. He said. In September, a few Democratic Party members
got some slightly encouraging signals from local governments, which
initially accepted their applications to form a social organization
to develop a party. But in recent weeks, as organizers like Xu
became more insistent and defiant, harassment by the police
increased.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this past week we felt something was going to happen,''
Ms. He said. ``It seemed that anyone who came to visit us was later
detained for a while. And there have been a lot more cars from the
Public Security Bureau parked outside than is usual.''

BREAKING UP IS HARD TO DO FOR LA MAFIA

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Houston-based Tejano supergroup La Mafia has decided
to call it quits after nearly two decades of music, international
success, two Grammy awards and a slew of multiplatinum albums.
</P>
<P>
   But not before one more tour.
</P>
<P>
   The band's latest album, ``Euforia,'' was released in September
on Sony Discos. The first single, ``Pido,'' was a top 20 hit on
Billboard's Hot Latin Tracks chart. La Mafia will hold a press
conference Thursday addressing the break-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been thinking about it. It's hard because I've been
doing this since I was 12 with La Mafia,'' lead singer Oscar de la
Rosa said Wednesday at Houston Sound Studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knew that this was going to happen. I didn't even know
it was going to happen. It's just something that I decided a few
months ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Located just off Interstate 45 North, Houston Sound Studio has
served as La Mafia's headquarters and recording studio. Every wall
is adorned with posters, platinum albums and snapshots.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, however, the fortress was quiet, and the mood
somber.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm just getting tired of doing the same thing,'' de
la Rosa said. ``All the touring, always away from home. You start
doing things because you have to, not because you want to. I want
to enjoy myself when I'm performing, and it's gotten to a point to
where it's like work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say that I didn't enjoy it, because I love
when the fans get into what you're doing. It just started getting
to a point to where it was work, and it wasn't music anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   La Mafia established itself as the premiere Tejano group in
Texas and around the world. After nearly two dozen albums on small
and local labels, the group signed with Sony Discos and released
``Estas Tocando Fuego'' in 1991. It sold more than 1 million copies
worldwide, a then-unheard-of number for the primarily regional
Tejano market.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent albums were also successful, thanks to La Mafia's
lilting blend of Tejano rhythms and pop sensibilities. The band
earned Grammys in 1997 for ``Un Millon de Rosas'' and in 1998 for
``En Tus Manos,'' both in the Mexican/Tejano category. Album sales
to date are well over the 5-million mark.
</P>
<P>
   Those past accomplishments are still important for de la Rosa,
as is the sense of family that developed within the band _ members
Leonard Gonzales, David de la Garza, Tim Ruiz, Michael Aguilar and
Mando Lichtenberger Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys have been wonderful. It's been great while it
lasted, but it's time to move on and try something else, do
something else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The break-up comes after much discussion, de la Rosa said.
Ultimately, he wanted to end things on good terms, instead of
waiting for the wear of hectic schedules and constant promotion to
develop into disagreements.
</P>
<P>
   De la Rosa downplayed rumors of fighting and money problems, but
pointed to problems with Sony Discos as a factor in the group's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Mexico, the past few years, I've been really, really
disappointed with the label. They haven't been doing their job.
They haven't been doing the work they should have been doing for
the band,'' he said, referring to the group's disappointing
promotional tour of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were there for a whole month, and we were promoting the
album (`Euforia'), visiting radio, doing TV shows,'' he said. ``We
were told (by the label) that the album was out, and we have people
that go out and check all the stores to make sure the product is
out. We find there is no product out in the stores, and so we
started asking questions. We had to cancel our tour in Mexico for
that reason. The band was totally upset with the record company
because we didn't get the respect we should've gotten.''
</P>
<P>
   La Mafia has canceled its scheduled appearances for December and
January, but the group will play 20-40 dates in the United States
and Mexico in 1999, de la Rosa said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked about opening the tour here in Houston or closing
the tour here in Houston, because Houston is our home base. Houston
is where the group was born,'' de la Rosa said. ``Once we go to one
city, it means we won't go back as La Mafia. It's going to be a
one-time thing, a last-time thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The group has one album remaining on its Sony contract. De la
Rosa said the group's final album will be similar stylistically to
``Euforia.'' An anthology of '80s hits is another possibility.
</P>
<P>
   La Mafia is selling most of its equipment, including lighting
rigs and tour buses. A bus recently purchased for the ``Euforia''
tour was sold to ``norteno'' group Los Palominos, and another truck
was sold to a musical group out of California. Houston Sound Studio
will remain. Lichtenberger, who served as La Mafia's keyboardist
and producer, will continue to work on projects with other artists.
</P>
<P>
   De la Rosa wants to get away from Houston for a few years, he
said, ``just try to start my new life ... maybe go to Miami, get
myself a condo in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, I'm happy it's over, then in a way I'm sad, because
... I'm still wondering what am I going to do. It's not going to be
the same. Come Christmas, New Year's Eve, you're always around your
friends. You're always together, and I know that this time around
we're not going to be together. Everybody's going to go their own
way. After 20 years of the same thing, it bothers you.'' &QL;

`BECKER' IS THE POSTER BOY FOR STRIDENCY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Look who's back: Ted Danson, that wild misfire called ``Ink''
safely behind him, returns to series television, and not a moment
too soon. He's gone psycho.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Becker,'' he's John Becker, doctor with an attitude. A bad
one.
</P>
<P>
   Let's assess the damage, shall we?
</P>
<P>
   On society: ``You know what's killing this country? Talk shows.
I watched one last night. I should have just stuck a fork in my
eye.''
</P>
<P>
   On talk show hosts: ``White trash is the only natural resource
this country will never run out of.''
</P>
<P>
   To an overweight patient: ``Your blood pressure's too high, your
cholesterol is through the roof, and your legs are killing you.
Then why wouldn't they be? Look what they're trying to hold up.''
</P>
<P>
   To his ditzy nurse's aide: ``If you shut your mouth, it keeps
the words from falling out like that.''
</P>
<P>
   To the homeless guy asking for spare change: ``You mean extra
change? Money that, if you weren't here, I would just throw away?''
</P>
<P>
   Becker rants and raves like this throughout the pilot, whether
eating or lounging or smoking (yeah, he puffs, on camera!) at his
favorite diner. There, he goes toe-to-toe with Reggie (Terry
Farrell), the cute female owner and certain love interest, and Jake
(Alex Desert), the blind newsstand proprietor armed with a few
snappy one-liners of his own.
</P>
<P>
   At his small clinic, Becker's head nurse (Hattie Winston)
catches his fury. At his apartment, which is supposed to be a guy's
sanctuary, Becker yells frantically out the window when a
neighbor's loud music bugs him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, foreigner,'' he screams. ``Turn that off or I'll call
immigration.''
</P>
<P>
   Creator and executive producer Dave Hackel, who produced
``Wings,'' says Becker is designed as the anti-sitcom, a half-hour
of equal-opportunity offending. He likens ``Becker'' to Archie
Bunker of ``All in the Family,'' who spoke his mind on bigotry and
politics, making us laugh at the absurdity of his views. These
days, ``You can't write about anything without offending someone,''
Hackel moans. ``It's a little silly.''
</P>
<P>
   So Becker is Archie without the narrow bigotry and with a brain,
zeroing in on the irritating aspects of contemporary American life.
The question, of course, is whether we'll laugh at his deranged
overreactions and if we'll simply tire of him going postal every
week.
</P>
<P>
   Hackel is betting that we'll not only laugh, but identify with
his tantrums, indulging our secret desires to see a loud,
music-playing foreigner get his.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's reading too much into ``Becker,'' but it reminds me
of the Michael Douglas film ``Falling Down,'' that kind of
manipulative revenge fantasy that shot its credibility by going
after such broad, easy targets.
</P>
<P>
   Same here. Everyone Becker meets should get it: The fat guy who
won't diet, the car saleswoman who cries on Becker's shoulder
(''Can I talk to a man salesman, please?''), the homeless guy
looking for change.
</P>
<P>
   He goes after TV talk shows, but Becker's own tone reminds me of
those glib, self-righteous jerks populating talk radio. Instead of
offering a coherent point of view, Becker merely gripes, hoping for
a reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, deep down, Becker isn't anti-sitcom at all.
Tonight, for instance, he shows compassion for an HIV-positive
7-year-old, even paying for the kid's treatment. And remember the
fat guy to whom he gave a tongue-lashing? Before leaving the
examination room, he tells him, softly, ``Hey, you can do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike, say, ``All in the Family,'' where Archie's views matured
and his heart softened, somewhat, over several years, ``Becker''
already has a heart. It's hidden from his colleagues but
conveniently exposed to viewers.
</P>
<P>
   This is essentially a cop-out, because Becker's under-the-table
good deeds are designed to take the sting out of the ranting that
lures us in the first place. We're asked to believe that Becker
isn't the true aggressor at all. He's merely the poor defender,
striking back at a lousy world.
</P>
<P>
   To me, he's merely an angry guy who needs to take a chill pill.
</P>

JUDGES ORDERS CLERGYMAN RELEASED TO WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ A federal judge ordered that an elderly former
pastor be handed over to a United Nations war crimes tribunal to
face charges of genocide in his native Rwanda, the man's lawyer
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge John Rainey issued the order Monday but gave
the defense lawyer 30 days to appeal the decision, effectively
delaying extradition.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey Clark, the former U.S. attorney general who is
representing Elizaphan Ntakirutimana, said he would appeal the
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Rainey ruled that there was sufficient evidence to warrant
Ntakirutimana's arrest and that it was legal to hand him over to
the tribunal. If that happens, it would mark the first time a
person arrested on U.S. soil would face a war crimes tribunal,
officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal, based in Tanzania, has accused the 74-year-old
Ntakirutimana of leading attackers armed with machetes, grenades
and guns in a murderous April 1994 rampage that killed dozens of
people who were hiding in the church.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Rwanda was in the throes of a bloody feud between
the country's dominant ethnic groups, the Hutus and Tutsis, strife
that killed an estimated 500,000 and sent 2 million refugees
fleeing to neighboring nations. Most of those killed, including
those in Ntakirutimana's church, were Tutsis. Ntakirutimana is a
member of the dominant Hutu ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
   Ntakirutimana, the former head of the Seventh-day Adventist
Church in Rwanda, is being held at the Webb County Jail in Laredo.
He has spent almost 20 months in the lockup.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a lifetime of religious service, he's met a tragedy of
biblical proportions, to his people, his ministry and himself,''
Clark said by telephone from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Clark contends it would be illegal to send Ntakirutimana to
stand trial before the tribunal because it would amount to the U.S.
government honoring a treaty that was made without the approval of
the Senate or the president.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said he would appeal to the Supreme Court, if necessary.
``It's certainly Supreme Court material,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the United Nations and the Justice Department,
which supports the extradition of the minister, could not be
reached for comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses, whose identities are being kept secret, have said
Ntakirutimana drove soldiers to the church compound in his pick-up
truck and carried a pistol.
</P>
<P>
   A witness, who survived the slaughter by hiding among the
bodies, quoted Ntakirutimana as saying: ``You are all condemned to
die. It is all over for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Ntakirutimana, who has battled severe health problems, had been
living with one of his sons, who is Laredo physician.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The judge's ruling is the latest twist in a case that has twice
sent Ntakirutimana to the Webb County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, a U.S. magistrate judge found the charges against
Ntakirutimana to be unconstitutional and ordered him freed after 15
months behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors refiled the case before Rainey, who then
ordered that Ntakirutimana be returned to jail. He has spent the
last five months behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   Clark contends Ntakirutimana is being unjustly accused as a
result of ethnic hatred and a government that despised
Ntakirutimana's power as the head of the 265,000-member church.
</P>
<P>
   He faces up to life in prison, a sentence the tribunal has
already handed to two former Rwandan government officials who were
convicted of genocide.

TURKEY'S EX-PREMIER ECEVIT IS ASKED TO FORM NEW GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ A week after the Turkish government fell in a
corruption scandal, President Suleyman Demirel on Wednesday asked a
veteran left-wing politician known for his personal honesty, Bulent
Ecevit, to form a new government.
</P>
<P>
   Ecevit, who served as prime minister three times in the 1970s,
said he would immediately begin working to fashion a government
that could command a majority in the faction-ridden Parliament. He
also suggested that although Parliament has set April 18 as the
date for a new election, he might seek to remain in power for a
longer period.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is wrong to see this government as simply an election
government,'' he said. ``There are problems that will not wait
until an election.''
</P>
<P>
   Military commanders, who hold ultimate power in Turkey, have
quietly told senior political figures, including Demirel, that they
do not want a quick election. They fear it will produce a
Parliament just as divided as the present one, perhaps with the
Islamic-oriented Virtue Party as the largest bloc.
</P>
<P>
   The commanders are also hoping to exclude two of the country's
leading politicians, outgoing Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and
former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, neither of whom they trust,
from posts in the new government. Ecevit must now try to build a
government that includes their center-right parties but not them as
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting this week the country's senior policy-making body,
the National Security Council, in which military officers have a
strong say, set three priorities for the coming months. It said
that whatever government emerges from forthcoming negotiations
should dedicate itself to fighting religious fundamentalism,
Kurdish nationalism and criminal gangs that have infiltrated the
state apparatus.
</P>
<P>
   Among Ecevit's immediate challenges will be to resolve a
political crisis with Italy that broke out last month when the
Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan was arrested in Rome and then
asked for political asylum there. Turkey wants Ocalan sent here for
trial, but Italy says it cannot extradite him as long as Turkey
retains the death penalty. Ecevit (pronounced EH-che-vit) is among
the few senior Turkish politicians who favors the abolition of
capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Together with Demirel, Ecevit is often cited by Turks who
complain about the continued dominance of a geriatric political
elite here. He is 73 and has been in politics for most of his adult
life.
</P>
<P>
   Early in his career Ecevit emerged as a spokesman for Turkey's
downtrodden masses. Perhaps more than any other figure, he
legitimized social democratic ideology in a climate where leftist
sympathies were often considered subversive.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, he has shown himself to be a fierce
nationalist. He was prime minister when Turkey sent troops to
occupy northern Cyprus in 1974 and is still considered a hard-liner
on Cyprus. He is also uncompromising in his opposition to Kurdish
nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   During his terms as prime minister in the 1970s, Ecevit
successfully undermined efforts to move Turkey toward membership in
the European Union, then called the European Economic Community. He
considered it an instrument of capitalist exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   Ecevit has also disturbed the United States by flirting with
anti-Western ideologies. In the early 1990s, during an interval
when he worked as a journalist, he traveled to Iraq and wrote a
series of articles favorable to Saddam Hussein. He recently called
for better relations between Turkey and Iraq, and maintains some of
the anti-imperialist positions and suspicion of capitalism that he
developed in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Socialist Party, which Ecevit heads, is a closely
held family fiefdom. He and his wife carefully screen applicants
for membership and veto those whose personal loyalty to Ecevit is
suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``During his terms as prime minister in the '70s, Ecevit did not
appear to be a consensus builder,'' said Ilter Turan, a professor
of political science at Bilgi University in Istanbul. ``It seems
that nowadays he is more accommodating, so from that perspective he
may not be bad choice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On many issues that Turkish society is encountering now, he
represents an orientation which does not seem to be totally in tune
with the times,'' Turan said. ``That would include his position on
issues like privatization, integrating Turkey more fully into the
international system, and the devolution of central authority. He
has failed to grasp where the world is heading. He looks at and
analyzes the world in categories that are no longer useful or
appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost alone among Turkish politicians, Ecevit lives modestly
and has avoided any hint of personal or financial scandal. He
speaks fluent English, and his reading tastes run to poetry and
intellectual journals such as The New York Review of Books. He has
translated the works of T.S. Eliot into Turkish and published
several volumes of his own poems.

SOCIAL IMPACT OF ASIA CRISIS IS WORSENING, REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ The social costs of the Asian economic crisis are
far higher than initial estimates and are ``dramatically
worsening,'' according to a report issued here on Tuesday by the
International Labor Organization, a U.N. agency.
</P>
<P>
   The ILO said the economic collapse had resulted in a combustible
mixture of soaring unemployment, spreading poverty and dashed
expectations. The lack of social welfare programs made the
hardest-hit countries, like Indonesia, ``fertile ground for
breeding social unrest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would veer to the pessimistic side,'' said Eddy Lee, an ILO
economist, who wrote the report. ``The unrest in Indonesia is
spilling over into Malaysia. And even where you don't have street
riots, there is a tremendous amount of social instability just
beneath the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia has seen violent clashes between soldiers and students
and between Christians and Muslims. In Malaysia demonstrators are
protesting against Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad for ousting and
imprisoning his deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
   The report called on governments to increase spending on social
programs, particularly unemployment insurance, which is largely
unknown in Asia. It likened the current crisis to the Great
Depression of the 1930s, which galvanized the United States to
weave a social safety net.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question we asked was, `What could people in these
countries expect?' '' Lee said. ``The answer was, `Very little.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In its bleak and even alarmist tone, the report is starkly at
odds with both Asia's resurgent financial markets and other
international agencies, like the International Monetary Fund, that
have played up the prospects for a rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said a swift recovery was unlikely, given the deeper than
expected recessions in Indonesia, Thailand and South Korea. In
Indonesia, the report estimates, economic output will decline 15
percent in 1998, while in Thailand and South Korea it will shrink
by 6.5 percent and 5 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the abrupt loss of commercial activity has come
rapidly accelerating unemployment. The report estimates that the
crisis has wiped out one-fifth of non-farm jobs in Indonesia this
year, a loss that will drive 40 million people, or 20 percent of
the population, into poverty.
</P>
<P>
   In Thailand, the report predicts, the unemployment rate will
triple, to 6 percent, this year. Even in South Korea, which is
perceived as being on the road to recovery, unemployment is
expected to jump to 8.2 percent, from 2.3 percent, while 12 percent
of Koreans will sink under the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the crisis has driven home is the consequence of not
having stronger social policies,'' Lee said. He noted that of these
countries, only South Korea offers even rudimentary unemployment
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Lee conceded that financially strapped Asian governments did not
have the resources to subsidize unemployment insurance on a mass
scale. But he said such benefits could be financed through a modest
payroll tax.
</P>
<P>
   With Asia moving from panic to painful recovery, more people are
focusing on the social implications of the downturn. Former Vice
President Walter Mondale said in an interview in Hong Kong
Wednesday that Indonesia, in particular, could spin out of control
without a sturdier social safety net.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have religious fissures, Christians fighting Muslims, and
disaffected students,'' said Mondale, who was sent by President
Clinton on a special mission to Indonesia last March. ``I'm very
worried about it.''

   TOUL DANGKOR, Cambodia _ At first it sounds like wind chimes in
the cool breeze, the merry clink of scores of little hammers on big
chunks of stone.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the sound of survival in this barren village, where
entire families, from grandparents to grandchildren, earn a scant
living by chipping and selling the rocks that lie buried around
them.
</P>
<P>
   The more skilled among them use a chisel to fashion grinding
stones for rice flour. Others _ particularly the children and the
elderly _ hammer small stones into smaller ones to be sold as
paving material.
</P>
<P>
   On a good day, a strong young man or woman can earn 80 cents or
so. This is enough for two meals a day of rice or rice gruel, but
not enough to buy radios or wristwatches or shoes.
</P>
<P>
   This is the way the people of Toul Dangkor have lived for
generations, deep in the countryside 50 miles north of Phnom Penh.
They are among the rural poor who make up some 80 percent of
Cambodia's 11 million people.
</P>
<P>
   It is the challenge of the country's newly installed leadership
_ as it has been the failed challenge of its predecessors _ to
address the hardships that make Cambodia one of the poorest nations
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Mer Thon, a 48-year-old villager, had a comment to make about
the inauguration of a new Parliament the other day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard that Cambodia is stable now,'' he said. ``But here in
the countryside it is not stable because there is nothing to eat.
They are stable, but we have nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Another villager, Huy Oan, 41, said she had voted with optimism
in the elections in July that produced the newly installed
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to have freedom and enough food and no war,'' she
said. ``Especially food.''
</P>
<P>
   But she said that although she was proud of her 8-year-old
daughter, Nay Huoy (``She knows how to make rock''), she did not
yet dare to hope for a better future for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is no more war I have a little hope for her,'' Mrs.
Huy Oan said. ``But if there's war, I have no hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Decades of war, brutality and the rapaciousness of corrupt
leaders have left the people of Cambodia so poor that King Norodom
Sihanouk said last year that he feared a new peasant revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gap separating the rich and poor is becoming deeper and
larger every day,'' he said. ``The social injustice is becoming
more and more intolerable. There are villages where our compatriots
are in rags and have nothing more to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   With a new government in place, Cambodia has a chance for a
fresh start. International donor groups are already stepping up
their aid. But mismanagement and the country's widespread
corruption remain major hurdles. And the problems are huge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything you read about malnutrition, AIDS, poverty in
general, about the degradation of the environment, is bleak reading
indeed,'' a European diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   And he noted that the government had yet to place its own
priority on social welfare.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 percent of the national budget is spent on the military
in a country that faces no external threat and, since the demise of
the Khmer Rouge insurgency, no major internal challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Just 10.3 percent of the budget is spent on health care in a
country where AIDS, malaria and dengue fever are rampant and where
nearly half the population has no access to health services.
</P>
<P>
   And only 6 percent goes to education in a nation with one of the
world's lowest literacy rates, about 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In a ``human development index'' calculating gross national
product, life expectancy and literacy, the U.N. Development Project
recently ranked Cambodia at 140 out of 174 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Life expectancy for men has fallen to just 50 years, according
to recent U.N. figures. Half the children under 5 are malnourished.
</P>
<P>
   This national portrait is evident in Toul Dangkor, where there
is no nearby school or clinic, no well, no electricity and no paved
road and where villagers reacted with awe and perplexity when
handed newspapers and magazines.
</P>
<P>
   The children are thin and underweight, barefoot and coughing. A
number died in a recent outbreak of dengue fever, the villagers
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the children earn their keep. As soon as they can heft a
hammer, usually at age 7 or 8, they are put to work.
</P>
<P>
   It is not as if the people here have been forgotten by the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Norodom Ranariddh, who has just been named the new
speaker of the National Assembly, put Toul Dangkor on his itinerary
last spring in his failed campaign to become prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when Ranariddh came,'' said the villager named Mer
Thon. ``He gave out T-shirts and cotton scarves. Then he left us
and never came back, and nothing has changed.''

TORY LEADER OUSTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In the first casualty of an increasingly divisive
battle between liberals and traditionalists, Lord Cranborne was
dumped Wednesday as the Conservative Party leader in the House of
Lords after Prime Minister Tony Blair said he had a deal with
Cranborne to reform the upper house of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Party leader William Hague appeared caught off
guard when Blair rose in the House of Commons and said he had cut a
deal with Lord Cranborne to steer through reform of the House of
Lords, the centerpiece of which is the abolition of the voting and
speaking rights of the so-called hereditary peers who inherit their
seats in the unelected, 1,164-member upper house.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the Conservative Party's traditional links to the
aristocracy, Tory peers account for the vast majority of the 759
hereditary peers, which gives the Tories a perpetual advantage in
the upper house, and Hague has made defending the hereditary peers
a key plank in his opposition party's platform.
</P>
<P>
   After the dramatic confrontation on the House of Commons floor
with Blair, who called Hague's opposition to Lords reform
``absurd'' given the deal struck between Cranborne and the
government, Hague called an emergency meeting with Tory peers.
Hague asked Cranborne to repudiate the deal claimed by Blair. When
Cranborne refused, Hague sacked him.
</P>
<P>
   Some parliamentarian observers said they could not recall a
similar situation in which a House of Commons leader had sacked the
party's Lords leader in a policy dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic war of words on the Commons floor between Blair and
Hague, and its apparently unprecedented aftermath, underscore how
the fate of the hereditary peers has become a battle of epic
proportions between Britain's two biggest political parties, a
defining moment in Blair's attempt to modernize British democracy
and traditionalists' desire to maintain the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's governing Labor party, which enjoys the biggest
parliamentary majority in nearly two centuries, sees the House of
Lords in general and its hereditary members in particular as relics
of Britain's aristocratic past. As part of his drive to make
Britain's democracy more similar to those in the rest of Europe,
Blair wants to drastically reform the unelected upper house and at
the very least make it more democratically accountable.
</P>
<P>
   Hague, whose party has struggled since Blair's election in May
1997 to find a cohesive opposition policy after leading the British
government for 18 years, says the government should not try to fix
something that is not broken. Hague and the Conservatives say the
Lords function perfectly well, and say Blair's claim that he wants
to democratize the upper house is a ruse to eliminate one of the
few checks on government power. They also say Blair wants to expand
his patronage patch, eliminating the hereditary peers, some of
whose titles go back to the Norman invasion, so he can appoint his
own handpicked peers.
</P>
<P>
   Blair has said he would forfeit his right to appoint so-called
life peers in exchange for reform, but the government's lack of a
precise model to replace the current upper house has led many
critics to say Blair is exploiting class divisions here to get rid
of a check on his power.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Lord Cranborne was until recently one of those who
accused Blair of megalomaniac excess in targeting the hereditary
peers for extinction. But the picture that emerged on the Commons
floor Wednesday was of someone who had accepted that, under law,
the Lords can delay a government's legislative intent for up to a
year but cannot unilaterally block it.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Cranborne's supporters describe him as a man of principle
who accepted the constitutional limits placed on the upper house,
and that he was wary of being used as a pawn in what is shaping up
as an unseemly partisan battle. They said he had agreed to a
compromise in which the government would leave 10 percent of the
hereditary peers in place until there was a consensus on how to
reform the upper house.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, however, Tory leaders denounced him as
duplicitous and disrespectful of Hague and putting the party leader
in an embarrassing position on the Commons floor.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the truth, Lord Cranborne is hardly the last casualty
in this latest battle of Britain.

JUDGE RULES TEXAS PAROLE BOARD VIOLATES LAW IN DECIDING CLEMENCY
PLEAS 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM HENDERSON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ For the second time this year a district judge in
Austin has ruled that the State Board of Pardons and Parole
violates the constitution and state laws in the way it decides
clemency pleas from condemned convicts.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling Tuesday in a class-action lawsuit filed on Oct. 9 by
death row inmates, state District Judge Paul Davis said the parole
board's practice of reviewing cases in secrecy ``violates the Texas
constitution and the Texas Open Meetings Act.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the two named plaintiff's is Joseph Stanley Faulder, the
Canadian national whose pending execution has drawn protests from
the Canadian government and a plea for a stay of execution from
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Faulder was arrested
and convicted of murdering a prominent East Texas woman without
being informed of his rights to contact his government _ a
violation of the 1969 Vienna Convention on Consular Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Davis issued a temporary restraining order requiring the board
to comply with the constitution by ``keeping a record of its
actions and stating the reasons for its actions'' and to comply
with the open meetings act by ``deliberating and voting in
public.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than hold meetings, the 18 members of the board review
inmate files individually and cast their vote by fax or telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, state District Judge Mary Pearl Williams made a
similar ruling in a suit brought by Lesley Lee Gosch, who was about
to be executed for the 1985 murder of a San Antonio woman during a
botched extortion attempt.
</P>
<P>
   She ordered that the board hold a public meeting to decide
Gosch's case, but the Court of Criminal Appeals overturned the
order because it would have delayed the execution _ a power that
Williams did not have.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Davis' order was issued Tuesday, Attorney General
Dan Morales, who has argued that the parole board is exempt from
the open meetings law, asked the appellate court to again overrule
the lower court.
</P>
<P>
   Austin attorney Kurt Sauer, who filed the class action suit on
behalf of Faulder, Andre Lewis and ``all other living persons who
are or will be on death row in Texas or who were on death row in
Texas after 1988,'' said there is a difference in the restraining
orders issued by the two judges: Davis' would not delay an
execution.
</P>
<P>
   It specifically states that ``because this court has no
authority to stay or interfere with an execution, if the (parole
board) fails to comply with this order by three o'clock p.m. on the
day of an execution, then this order shall expire as to that
individual plaintiff.''
</P>
<P>
   The order would remain in effect for other inmates seeking
clemency until a higher court vacates it.
</P>
<P>
   Parole Board Chairman Victor Rodriguez could not be reached
Wednesday for comment on the judge's order, but after the Gosch
case last spring he said that the board might reconsider its
procedures and hold public meetings to decide the clemency cases.
It continued to deliberate and vote in private, however.
</P>
<P>
   Sauer said he will file a response on Friday to the attorney
general's motion asking the Court of Criminal Appeals to overturn
Davis' order. He plans to continue attacking the argument that the
parole board is exempt from the open meetings law.
</P>
<P>
   He said legislation passed in 1993 states that the board ``does
not have to meet as a body,'' but claims that does not give it a
blanket exemption.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legislative history is clear,'' he said. ``The House
wanted to exempt everything (concerning the parole board) and the
Senate wouldn't go for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Dusek, a spokesman for the attorney general, said the
language of the statute is clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are not required to meet as a body, there is no public

<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Microsoft Corp. portrayed itself Wednesday as the
victim of a monopoly plot in claiming that arch-rival Sun
Microsystems Inc. hatched plans in 1995 to seize control of both
the software and hardware that powers personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   By inserting a sheaf of previously secret Sun documents into the
landmark antitrust trial, the company claimed it was the intended
target of Sun's new Java technology. To further its own
monopolistic goals, Microsoft said, Sun seeks to displace Windows
on users' desktops and the Intel Corp. chips mated to Microsoft's
operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft lawyer Tom Burt contended that under a September 1995
business plan, Sun, in the company's words, wanted to ``turn Java
into a complete architecture and product franchise for computing''
while establishing ``a high-volume, low-margin hardware product
line based on Java and breakthrough graphics performance.''
</P>
<P>
   But James Gosling, a Sun vice president and Java's chief
creator, said, ``Taking a Java virtual machine and putting it on a
piece of silicon would be a nutty thing to do, to use a technical
term.''
</P>
<P>
   From the witness chair, Gosling largely dismissed the internal
documents and e-mails from Bill Joy, one of Sun's chief strategists
and a co-founder of the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill invents 10 products a day with the names he attaches to
them,'' Gosling said.
</P>
<P>
   When Burt persisted in asserting that Microsoft was the wronged
party, allegedly fertile prey to Sun's planned ``all-encompassing
complete computing platform,'' Gosling shot back: ``You make it
sound as if we tried to take control of 100 percent of the computer
universe. We would have been happy with two orders of magnitude
below that.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, as Burt stood by helplessly, Gosling, a direct man
with shoulder-length hair that flows below a bald crown, engaged in
a seven-minute tutorial with U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson on the subtler points of the Java technology he invented in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   But Gosling conceded under cross-examination that Java may not
yet be ready for prime time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certainly tasks to which Java is not appropriate.
That's why there are multiple languages in the world,'' Sun's chief
scientist said.
</P>
<P>
   Gosling claims Microsoft has used its deep financial pockets and
its clout with software developers in a bid to scuttle
cross-platform Java.
</P>
<P>
   His views were echoed on the federal courthouse plaza by David
Boies, the government's top litigator, who said: ``This is a case
on whether consumers should have a choice between Windows and
something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Gosling's testimony, Boies showed another videotape of
Microsoft chairman Bill Gates. The highlight from the August
deposition came when Boies asked Gates about a May 1997 e-mail
message in which one of his lieutenants, Ben Slivka, said, ``We're
going to be pissing on (a new version of Java) at every
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   In a lengthy and often comical exchange with Boies, Gates said:
``He might mean that we're going to be clear that we're not
involved with it, that we think there's a better approach.''
</P>
<P>
   ``... Would it be fair for me to assume that 'pissing on' is not
some code word that means saying nice things about you, that has
the usual meaning that it would in the vernacular?'' Boies asked.
</P>
<P>
   Gates replied: ``... Believe me, it's not a term that's commonly
used. ... In this case I think it means what you've suggested.''

COMMENTARY: TRUTH IN TRAVIS COUNTY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)   (bl)  
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Now the lies.
</P>
<P>
   I got a call at my hotel a little after 9 p.m. Monday from
Ronnie Earle, the district attorney of Travis County. I had spoken
to him earlier in the evening but now there was a heightened
urgency to his tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things you don't know about this case, that you
haven't been privy to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He was talking about Lacresha Murray. Now 14, Lacresha is
serving a sentence of 25 years for the beating death in 1996 of
2{-year-old Jayla Belton. I have been writing columns about the two
convictions (the first was thrown out) that Earle's office managed
to get against Lacresha without the benefit of any witnesses or
physical evidence linking her to the child's death.
</P>
<P>
   Earle is an affable politician, cooperative and readily
accessible. But you can almost feel him steaming over the
suggestion that his office, through negligence or incompetence or
worse, had driven an innocent child into prison. ``If you had all
the facts,'' he said, ``you might change your mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the trials long over and Lacresha sent off to the
Giddings State Home and School, Earle was calling to say for the
first time that Lacresha's own grandparents had told authorities
they were afraid to leave small children with her because she was
``so rough with them.'' He said one of his top aides recalled that
the grandparents, R.L. and Shirley Murray, who are Lacresha's
adoptive parents, had expressed very specific concerns about the
threat Lacresha posed.
</P>
<P>
   This was news to me. I had never heard that Lacresha's
grandparents thought she was dangerous. I asked the DA why this had
never come up in our previous conversations, including an extensive
telephone interview I did two weeks ago with him and the aide,
Assistant District Attorney Gary Cobb.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first place I didn't know it,'' Earle said. He said it
was Cobb who had clued him in, that it was Cobb who knew all the
details. ``I had only passing familiarity with this,'' said Earle.
</P>
<P>
   He said Cobb probably hadn't mentioned it because he was not
comfortable dealing with the press.
</P>
<P>
   I immediately got in touch with Keith Hampton, the scrupulous,
straightforward young lawyer who is handling Lacresha's appeal.
When I told him of Earle's comments, he said: ``It's fiction as far
as I know. And the timing of this revelation suggests its
improbability.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton said he had studied the records from both trials and
anything of that nature would ``stand out in my mind. It doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Murray, when asked about the DA's comments, said:
``That's not true. We never did leave the children with Lacresha
because she was just 11 years old. But I would have trusted her
with any child.''
</P>
<P>
   R.L. Murray said, ``I never said anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday the district attorney was backtracking. He said he
thought his comments had been off the record. (They weren't.) He
said he had not expected his comments to be taken as ``specific
facts.'' He said, ``I was not trying to give you a verbatim
rendition of anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, his staff had spent the previous 36 hours trying to
find anything similar to what their boss had said on Monday. They
came up with a signed statement from R.L. Murray, who was grilled
intensely by the police soon after Jayla's death. Murray knew at
the time that he and Lacresha were potential suspects.
</P>
<P>
   He said of Lacresha: ``In the past Lacresha has been with small
children. I have never seen her abuse children.'' He said he had
seen children a couple of times with bruises that he described in
the statement as ``suspicious.'' But he did not attribute those
bruises to Lacresha. He said that if Lacresha had, in fact, killed
Jayla he would want to see her ``get some help.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth in Travis County is elusive. Earle's reckless
assertion Monday night, in keeping with his office's attempts from
the beginning to portray Lacresha as an 11-year-old monster, turned
out not to be true. It wasn't the first time that bad information
had come out of his office. It was just the latest desperate
attempt to justify a case that wasn't even put together with smoke
and mirrors, just smoke.

$25 MILLION GRANT TO ESTABLISH CENTER FOR BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RUTH SoRELLE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A five-year, $25 million grant from the Houston-based
Brown Foundation will enable Baylor College of Medicine to
establish the Center for Brain and Behavior to integrate basic
research and treatment of mental illness, school officials
announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The brain is the answer,'' said Dr. James Patrick, vice
president and dean of research at the medical college. ``This
institute will provide special care for specific brain-related
ailments and will really be an excellent setting for clinical basic
research into the genetic basis of mental illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mental illness has been poorly served by research funding in
the past,'' said Patrick, who is also chairman of Baylor's
Department of Neuroscience.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding the biologic and genetic bases of mental illnesses
will contribute to the creation of better treatments, Patrick said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stuart Yudofsky, chairman of psychiatry, said there's an
enormous stigma associated with psychiatric disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``That stigma clouds the fact that these are highly common,
serious illnesses,'' Yudofsky said. ``When they occur, it is
devastating not only for the patient but also for their families
and the community at large.''
</P>
<P>
   The center will concentrate on four areas of study and
treatment: affective disorders, neuropsychiatric disorders of
learning and memory, psychotic disorders and addictive behaviors.
</P>
<P>
   Affective disorders include depression and major bipolar
disorders as well as associated anxiety disorders. Public health
officials estimate that one in five women and one in 10 men will
suffer from a depressive illness at one point.
</P>
<P>
   The learning and memory portion will focus on diseases of the
central nervous system that affect learning and memory of children
and adults.
</P>
<P>
   The study of psychotic disorders will focus on understanding
schizophrenia at all levels with the goal of developing better
drugs and treatments.
</P>
<P>
   In the addictive behaviors section, alcoholism and the abuse of
legal and illegal substances will be studied to determine how the
brain is changed by these mind-altering compounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have just hit the point where we have the tools in science
to understand the biological bases for these conditions,'' Yudofsky
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the new center will look at the biological, social,
psychological and spiritual approaches to treatment of mental
health problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been quoted in the past that it is very dangerous to
leave out the biologic or brain components in mental health,'' he
said. ``I call it `brainless psychiatry.' However, I don't want to
have a mindless approach to it either. It is important to be
comprehensive.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brown Foundation was established in 1951 by Alice Pratt
Brown, George R. Brown, Herman Brown and Margaret Root Brown.
George and Herman Brown founded Brown and Root Inc., a construction
company with holdings in oil, real estate, paper mills and mining.
All of its philanthropy has been in the state of Texas. &QL;

EXPERTS SPECULATE THAT OIL GIANT ROYAL DUTCH/SHELL GROUP WILL
ACQUIRE MAJOR U.S. COMPANY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MICHAEL DAVIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that the dust has cleared on the merger of Exxon and Mobil,
speculation has shifted to whether Royal Dutch/Shell Group will
also gobble up a major U.S. oil company,
</P>
<P>
   If the oil giant makes that move _ and there is no indication
that the company is even talking to potential merger partners _
many expect Texaco to be the likely candidate, largely because of
existing ties the two companies have in their U.S. refining and
marketing operations.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron Corp. and Atlantic Richfield Co. are also considered
prime merger candidates, but it is Texaco that analysts say may be
pushed into the arms of Shell by the Exxon-Mobil merger and British
Petroleum's deal to buy Amoco.
</P>
<P>
   The Texaco-Shell speculation shifted into high gear earlier this
week when the two companies called off talks for an alliance in
their European refining and retail operations. Many viewed it as a
sign that a bigger deal was in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Moving to squelch the rumors, Texaco's chairman and chief
executive said Wednesday the company is shopping for acquisitions
and alliances but has no plans to rush into a merger to remain
competitive with the new breed of ``super majors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not rush into anything. I do not feel the urge to
merge,'' Peter Bijur said at the company's annual meeting with Wall
Street analysts.
</P>
<P>
   But the companies have ties that keep the takeover talk alive.
</P>
<P>
   Texaco and Shell already have a joint venture of their refining
operations in the United States, a chief factor contributing to
speculation that they might merge completely.
</P>
<P>
   Shell has not given any public indication that it is looking for
a merger with Texaco or any other major oil company, said Stacy
Hutchinson, a spokeswoman for Shell Oil Co., Royal Dutch/Shell's
U.S. oil and gas exploration unit based in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Following Bijur's remarks, Texaco's stock lost 2 to close at 54
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to have a wider base of opportunities,'' Bijur said.
``That's why we continue to look for acquisitions,'' he said. As
for being taken over, he said, ``I never say `never' to anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts' opinions vary on the potential benefits of a
Texaco-Shell union, with some saying it would make sense while
others feel Shell already has enough problems managing all of its
assets. All, however, agree that more big deals are coming as long
as oil prices remain depressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speculation is running wild because Exxon has proven that size
is going to matter,'' said Lysle Brinker, senior vice president at
John S. Herold Inc. ``And Shell has kind of floundered in the last
couple of years; they have seen their earnings decline more sharply
then other majors such as Exxon as oil prices have dropped.''
</P>
<P>
   Texaco would be a more likely candidate to pair off with Shell
than Chevron, Brinker said, because buying Chevron would give the
combined company so much of the U.S. refining and marketing market
that such a deal would probably not pass regulatory approval.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Dutch/Shell saw its earnings drop 56 percent in the third
quarter compared to the same time last year, the result of low oil
prices and the Asian economic crisis. Exxon, by contrast, only had
a 23 percent decline in third quarter profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you could say that Shell has got its work cut out for
it rationalizing its existing asset base,'' said Adam Sieminski,
oil analyst with BT Alex. Brown in Baltimore. ``They don't need the
headache of a merger. They have had two very bad quarters and have
admitted to analysts that they have failed to deliver on their
promises.''
</P>
<P>
   Others believe Exxon is not finished and may target another
major for acquisition after it completes its deal to buy Mobil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not sure that Exxon is done,'' said Paul Korus, oil
analyst with Petrie Parkman &AMP; Co. in Denver. ``I don't think we
should be surprised by any further consolidation that involves
Texaco, Chevron or Arco.''
</P>
<P>
   A report in the San Francisco Examiner on Wednesday quoted a
Chevron spokeswoman as saying the trend of huge mergers might not
be right for Chevron.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of speculation out there,'' said Dawn Soper with
Chevron in San Francisco, ``but the continued speculation that you
have to be bigger is not a philosophy we subscribe to.'' &QL;

AS FRANCE'S WEATHER TURNS COLD, UNIONS TURN UP THE HEAT 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ French train conductors say they're lonely and
overworked, so they have been on strike since last Thursday,
disrupting long-distance rail service in many regions.
</P>
<P>
   French journalists say their paychecks don't buy as much as they
used to, so they went on strike this week, too _ not against their
newspapers and television and radio stations, but against a
government plan to do away with a special tax deduction of up to
50,000 francs, or $8,850, that they have enjoyed since 1934.
</P>
<P>
   The long-term unemployed, who closed state job offices last
Christmas and demanded higher benefits, occupied an unemployment
office Monday in Marseilles, where the movement began last year,
demanding a Christmas bonus of 3000 francs, or $530, like the one
they received last year.
</P>
<P>
   The French have been taking to the streets since the Revolution,
usually to demand something from the state. Not surprisingly,
because government spending amounts to 56 percent of the gross
domestic product, compared with 41 percent in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the year, when the days become short, cold and gray,
usually brings a spate of labor disputes and visions of paralyzing
national shutdowns like the three-week transportation strike in
1995 that sealed the fate of a conservative government that had
tried to reduce pension benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The latest strike on the state railroad is not anywhere near
that big. But its 11,000 conductors have kept up steady pressure to
try to force the network to hire additional conductors. A union
conductor in Bordeaux, Sauveur Ventura, told Agence France-Presse
on Monday that it was sometimes a lonely job with many
responsibilities but nobody to talk to except passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition, we're also attacked by customers who complain
about fares being raised,'' Ventura said.
</P>
<P>
   Then Agence France-Presse shut down most of Tuesday because of
the journalists' strike.
</P>
<P>
   The 182,000 railway workers run some of the fastest, cleanest
and sleekest trains in the world. These days they work, indirectly,
for a Communist, Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot, under a
Socialist government that promises to reduce the workweek for all
of them to 35 hours a week starting next year, as some have had for
years. But the conductors are also striking to make sure that the
workweek reductions are negotiated seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The former aerospace executive in charge of the railroad, Louis
Gallois, said last week that railroad employees accounted for 20
percent to 30 percent of all workdays lost to strikes in France.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the way the enterprise resolves its internal conflicts,''
Gallois said. ``Everybody lives off strikes, the hierarchy, the
administration, the staff and the labor unions.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though fewer than 10 percent of all workers in France
belong to unions, opinion polls show that the French people as
often as not sympathize with them.
</P>
<P>
   That may not be true of journalists, whose profession is one of
73 that enjoyed special tax breaks that a Conservative government
decided three years ago to try to abolish. Journalists, including
foreign correspondents based here, can deduct 30 percent of their
salaries, up to the 50,000 franc ceiling, from their taxable income
as a writeoff for supposedly nonitemizable professional expenses.
</P>
<P>
   An accountant who works for many journalists here, Richard Van
Ham, said losing the deduction would cost many a loss of income.
Print and broadcasting employees' unions demonstrated Tuesday in
front of Parliament, even though the upper house had voted to
postpone consideration of the measure for a year.

KELLOGG ANNOUNCES JOB CUTS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   In a widely expected move intended to help revive its ailing
cereal business, Kellogg Co. said Wednesday that it would dismiss
525 salaried employees from its North American operations and would
eliminate 240 of about 600 contracted positions.
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg, the maker of Rice Krispies and Frosted Flakes, said it
would take a one-time charge against fourth-quarter profits of $45
million, or 11 cents a share, to pay for the job cuts, which the
company expects will reduce annual expenses by about $105 million.
Those savings would help offset increased spending on product
development and promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg said most of the job cuts, which will affect 21 percent
of its salaried work force, would come from operations at its
headquarters in Battle Creek, Mich., but that about 25 percent
would come from sales division and plants elsewhere in North
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strategy is centered on increasing growth in our
ready-to-eat cereal business, accelerating the expansion of our
convenience foods and continu/usly improving the cost efficiency of
our operations worldwide,'' said Arnold Langbo, chairman and chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were not impressed. Shares of Kellogg fell 93.75
cents, to $36.375.
</P>
<P>
   The market reaction, analysts and fund managers said, was a
signal to the company that management would have to take more
decisive action to improve the company's long-term prospects. ``We
consider this to be the first step in what is likely to be a long
journey to turn the company around,'' said Eric Katzman, an analyst
at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the analysts and fund managers said, management has
offered few details about how it plans to compete more effectively
as bagel makers and manufacturers of cheaper, private-label cereals
continue to erode Kellogg's sales.
</P>
<P>
   The company's revenue and profits have plummeted. Last month,
Kellogg reported a 32 percent drop in third-quarter profits, to
$141.9 million, or 35 cents a share, and warned that earnings for
the full year would be disappointing, possibly falling as much as
20 percent.

COURT APPROVES SUIT BY SON IN NOTORIOUS MURDER CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than four decades after Dr. Sam Sheppard was convicted of
murdering his wife in a case that transfixed America, the Ohio
Supreme Court cleared the way Wednesday for his son to finally try
to prove his father's innocence and to sue the state of Ohio for
wrongfully imprisoning him.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio's highest court ruled, 4-3, against a request by the
Cuyahoga County prosecutor to stop the suit by the son, Sam Reese
Sheppard, from going to trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm heartened we're getting our day in court, and I'm
surprised, because I didn't think the Supreme Court would have the
will to do this,'' said Sheppard, who lives in Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Sheppard was 7 years old in 1954 when his father was found
guilty of bludgeoning his wife, Marilyn, to death in their lakeside
home in suburban Cleveland, and was sentenced to life in prison.
Ten years later Sheppard's conviction was overturned by the U.S.
Supreme Court on the ground that the news media turned the trial
into a carnival, and in a second trial Sheppard was found not
guilty.
</P>
<P>
   But the son believed that justice had not been done, and
embarked on an investigation that has now found DNA evidence
exonerating his father and pointing to a window washer at the
Sheppard home as the murderer.
</P>
<P>
   The Shepard case, the O.J. Simpson trial of the 1950s, entered
popular culture by forming the basis for the television series
``The Fugitive'' and the movie of the same name.
</P>
<P>
   Sheppard contended that a ``bushy-haired'' intruder was the real
killer. But prosecutors always dismissed his defense, and the case
has continued to polarize Cleveland. Indeed, Stephanie Tubbs Jones,
the prosecutor in Cleveland who tried to block the wrongful
imprisonment trial, issued a statement Wednesday saying she would
``ask the Supreme Court to reconsider its decision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me clearly state,'' Ms. Jones said, that the Ohio Supreme
Court's opinion ``in no way suggests that Sam Sheppard should be
declared innocent or that his claim for money damages has any
merit.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones, who was elected to Congress last month, will leave
the prosecutor's office in January, but she has taken what some
lawyers, politicians and journalists in Cleveland see as a tough,
personal stance against Sheppard and his efforts to clear his
father.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones said she would also ask the trial judge, Ronald
Suster, of Cuyahoga County, to find that the statute of limitations
had expired and that Sheppard had no legal standing to bring a case
for wrongful imprisonment on his father's behalf. Ms. Jones made
similar arguments to the state Supreme Court in trying to stop the
trial, but the court majority rejected her contentions and held
that they were issues that could be decided by the trial judge.
</P>
<P>
   As an indication of how politically sensitive the Sheppard case
remains, one of the three dissenting justices on the Ohio Supreme
Court, Francis Sweeney, was an assistant prosecutor in Sheppard's
second trial. He refused to recuse himself.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Gilbert, the lawyer for Sheppard, said he would be happy
``to sit down and discuss a settlement in a civil way'' with the
prosecutor's office. ``This case has been a painful legacy for
Cleveland,'' Gilbert said, ``and it's time that the community
resolve the tragedy and acknowledge that Sam Sheppard was
wrongfully imprisoned and that this had consequences for him, his
family and our system of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert said he did not expect the trial for a declaration of
innocence and wrongful imprisonment to begin before next summer,
given the complexity of the case. If Sheppard was found to be
wrongfully imprisoned, under Ohio law his son could then bring a
separate suit for damages in the state Court of Claims.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert said he and Sheppard had not yet discussed what amount
of damages they would seek. By law, the state would be liable for
$25,000 for each of the 10 years that Sheppard served in prison,
plus lawyers fees and any loss of earnings, which could be
considerable, given that he had had a large medical practice.
</P>
<P>
   Among the evidence Gilbert plans to introduce will be DNA
evidence taken from the exhumed body of Sheppard and wood chips
with blood smears taken by police from the Sheppards' house after
the murder. The evidence was examined by Mohammad Tahir, a
supervisor of DNA and serology at the Indianapolis-Marion County
Forensic Services Agency.
</P>
<P>
   According to Tahir, the samples show the blood did not come from
either Sheppard or his wife; therefore, there must have been a
third person present at the murder. That person, Tahir said, was
the window washer, Richard Eberling, whose DNA was obtained after a
court order as part of Sheppard's lawsuit. Eberling, who had been
convicted of another murder, died in prison last July.

COMMENTARY: YOU BET YOUR LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Let me lay before you a modest proposal that will
enable us to double aid to education, insure everybody's health,
put a million new cops on the streets and install an impenetrable
missile defense _ all while cutting taxes across the board.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the big idea: a national lottery with the world's first
billion-dollar jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   Radical, you say? Smacks of a banana republic, unbefitting the
only global superduperpower? You are out of step with the people;
you have missed the great something-for-nothing cultural shift.
</P>
<P>
   Gambling is now far more American than apple pie. Annual U.S.
sales of apple pie (35 percent of the total pie market) can be
estimated at a mere $150 million; the gaming profession (formerly
the casino industry, and before that the gambling racket) turns
over bets of at least $50 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians oppose gambling's political juggernaut at their
peril. The Republican governors of South Carolina and Alabama,
old-fashionably trying to resist the tide of lotteries and video
poker games in their states, were overwhelmed by candidates advised
by the Cajun Clintonian, James Carville, to advocate letting the
good dice roll.
</P>
<P>
   And not just in the swingin' South did the bingo brigades
triumph in the '98 elections. Missouri showed us the way in an
initiative legalizing ``boat in the moat'' casinos on riverboats
that sit in man-made basins.
</P>
<P>
   Arizonans voted 2 to 1 to continue their troubled lottery.
Californians by the same margin gave Indian tribes the right to
build glitzy casinos to snatch back high-rolling palefaces from Las
Vegas, in the highest-spending statewide campaign in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   Only in Maryland did the gambling fever fail to infect the
populace. Gov. Parris Glendening, a Democrat, standing in the
racetrack gate to bar slot machines, turned back a conservative
candidate backed by gambling interests.
</P>
<P>
   The people have spoken. Morality, shmorality. Those of us
fuddy-duddies who hold that state-sponsored gambling is a
perversion of public policy have been routed. Time not just to move
on, but to move up to the Age of the Crapshooter.
</P>
<P>
   Who can be expected to support my Billion-Dollar National
Lottery (BDNL)?
</P>
<P>
   Democratic intellectuals should seize upon it. First, it would
put the federal government in direct competition with private
casino operators, always a desirable matchup. Second, a national
lottery, with its publicizable billion-dollar jackpot, would
undermine the burgeoning state lottery system and concentrate power
in Washington, always better equipped to allocate resources fairly.
</P>
<P>
   Republican fat cats should be supportive. Everyone in the 38
percent bracket knows that it is in the nature of lotteries to soak
the poor, who have been getting away with economic murder since the
imposition of progressive taxation. Under the BDNL, the sure losers
_ those poor suckers happy to contribute a high percentage of their
earnings to a lottery _ make it possible to reduce the heavy tax
burden of life's winners.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign strategists of both parties will set up their dissembly
lines. All know that with the siren call of money ``earmarked for
education,'' lottery income soon substitutes for general revenues
formerly spent on education. Thus, in the hands of persuasive focus
groupies, a surreptitious sin tax can masquerade as a virtuous,
pain-free non-tax.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition is likely to come from newly affluent Indian tribes
now snatching bread from the mouths of Bugsy Siegel's successors.
Sen. Richard (Slots for Tots) Bryant of Nevada induced the General
Accounting Office to launch a $70,000 harassment of the federal
commission finding rampant compulsive gambling. Instead, his
contributor-constituents should get him to induce tax-free tribal
profiteers to reduce the $1.7 billion budget of Interior's Bureau
of Indian Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious challenge to the BDNL will come from the
cyberbettors. Government-sponsored gambling will whet the next
generation's appetite for ever-greater ripoffs of indigent
thrill-seekers. Our great national bet would ultimately be covered
and raised: On the Internet, helping squeeze a few hundred million
taka out of Bangladesh, millennial gamblers can foresee the
Trillion-Dollar Global Jackpot.

 &HT;        TIMONEY RIPS PHILLY POLICE DEPARTMENT AT LIVABLE CITIES
CONFERENCE   By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, December 2 -- During Philadelphia Police
Commissioner John Timoney's first nine months heading up the city's
department, he encountered problems he had never seen before, he
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   When he took over the department of 7,000 officers, his first
challenge was that he could only find 6,500 of them, Timoney said
in a speech at the Heritage Foundation's Livable Cities Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Timoney, who is credited with restructuring New York City's
police force as first deputy commissioner of the department, and
helping to lower the city's crime rate in his tenure, proceeded to
pepper his speech with jokes that ripped apart the Philadelphia
department.
</P>
<P>
   He said when he got to Philly, he found an inefficient
department organization, a lack of higher education in the upper
ranks, federal court decrees that tied officers' hands, and ``one
union'' that ``fits all.''
</P>
<P>
   But before you can turn a department around, he said, you have
to know where everyone is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sort of a game,'' Timoney said. ``Let's find the
missing officers who are on the payroll, but who are gone.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he located the officers, some of whom were on loan to
other localities, while others were on special task forces that
were never dissolved after their stated mission expired.
</P>
<P>
   Under his watch, every task force must have an expiration date
when its mission will be reviewed, Timoney said. If an officer is
loaned to another locality, he must have a specific return date.
</P>
<P>
   He said federal court decrees keep officers from doing their
jobs, citing one that essentially required officers to read crime
witnesses Miranda rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell a witness they have the right to remain silent ...
that's insane,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Philadelphia's gun-related crime rate was ``out of
control.'' Of the 410 homicides reported in 1997 in the City of
Brotherly Love, 327 were committed by handgun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can get a gun in this city unless you have a
criminal record,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Timoney said there is a ``woeful lack of higher education'' in
the upper ranks.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 percent of Philadelphia's officers with a rank of
captain or above have college degrees, while in cities like New
York, nearly all officers in the higher ranks are expected to have
degrees, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He extended the police academy training from 25 to 32 weeks.
Also, he started a program in September with six universities that
allows police officers to continue their education.
</P>
<P>
   Timoney said he had never seen a department where ``one union
fits all.'' The same union that represents the commissioner also
serves his lower-ranked colleagues. He said it defied logic that if
the chief decided to sue him it would be through a union lawyer
paid for by both of their dues.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best methods for turning a department around is by
being honest to community members, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People may not like what I have to say,'' Timoney said. ``But
by the end after I tell them what the problems are and how I plan
to fix them, I usually win them over.''

BAY STATE TAX TAKE UP 11 PERCENT OVER '97 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HILARY SARGENT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Defying economists' predictions in the spring that the
state's booming economy would slow down this fall, Massachusetts
continues to bring in a bonanza of tax revenue, with collections
running nearly 11 percent ahead of levels at this time last year.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, by November 1997 tax revenues had increased about 4
percent over the previous year. By the end of the fiscal year, or
June 30, the state had a record $1 billion budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   November tax revenues, just released, jumped roughly 12 percent
over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   If the torrid pace continues, the state will enjoy another huge
budget surplus that will likely set off another round of disputes
over tax cuts and spending plans.
</P>
<P>
   A large surplus would also bolster Governor Paul Cellucci's call
to reduce the state's income tax rate to 5 percent, a cut that
would trim revenue intake by more than $1 billion. Democratic
legislative leaders have resisted such a cut, in part because they
say the immediate future of the state's economy is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   In the month of November, the state collected $972 million,
compared to $866.8 million during the same month a year ago,
according to Acting Revenue Commissioner Bernard F. Crowley, Jr.
The revenue collected thus far in the fiscal year totals $5.43
billion, up $522.9 million, or nearly 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``All major tax categories continue to show steady growth, with
the past month's revenue bolstered by strong sales tax collections,
which is good news as we begin the holiday season,'' Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
   During November, sales tax collections were up about 19 percent
from the same month last year, totaling almost $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   The business excise tax levied on banks, insurance companies,
and public utilities has shown remarkable growth, rising almost 47
percent between July 1 and November 30, compared to the same period
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing the five-month periods, net income taxes are up about
10 percent, sales taxes nearly 7 percent and corporate taxes almost
12 percent.

<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., _ Buoyed by an improved weather forecast,
NASA made final preparations late Wednesday for a pre-dawn launch
of the shuttle Endeavour, with six astronauts and the second
component of the new international space station.
</P>
<P>
   Endeavour's launch window from the Kennedy Space Center was
limited to a 10-minute period to enable the shuttle and its 25,000
pound station payload to reach the orbiting station component
launched by the Russians on Nov. 20.
</P>
<P>
   As night fell Wednesday, mission managers directed ground teams
to fill the shuttle's fuel tanks with explosive propellants. Rain
showers posed a small threat to the liftoff, but forecasters said
conditions had improved overall.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters closely watched cloudy conditions at the shuttle's
three emergency runways in Europe and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Loaded in the shuttle's payload bay is the station's Unity
module, a 33-foot long cylinder with a half-dozen docking ports
that will connect a future U.S. laboratory module, airlock and
power generating gear to the new outpost.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian-built Zarya module, a much larger spacecraft
designed to provide propulsion, electrical power, guidance and
ground communications, awaited the shuttle crew's arrival in an
orbit just over 240 miles high. The $240 million, U.S.-financed
Zarya was launched by the Russians from Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The Endeavour crew plans to rendezvous with Zarya then, using
the shuttle's robot arm and at least three long spacewalks, join
the two components. Forty-five launches are envisioned over the
next six years to fully assemble an orbital complex that will
sprawl to the size of two football fields placed side by side.
</P>
<P>
   ``This crew is ready and very excited about their upcoming
mission,'' said Frank Culbertson, NASA's director of space station
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-day flight will require Endeavour's crew to embrace a
day-for-night work regime.
</P>
<P>
   Endeavour commander Bob Cabana, pilot Rick Sturckow, flight
engineer Nancy Currie, spacewalkers Jerry Ross and Jim Newman and
Russian cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev awakened Wednesday afternoon and
prepared for the early morning trip to the launching pad.
</P>
<P>
   Stowed aboard the shuttle during its countdown were a pair of
Russian electronic devices and cabling that Krikalev may be asked
to install aboard Zarya. The electronic controller on one of six
power storage batteries aboard the module that discharges
electricity is not working properly.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the balky battery's charging and discharging is being
handled by ground control teams. A repair would re-automate the
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision is basically risk versus risk,'' said Culbertson.
``Do you want to take the risk of leaving it as is, hoping for no
further failures, or do you want to take the risk of changing it
out, making a mistake or making it worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Delegates from many of the 16 nations involved in the massive
project assembled at Kennedy to witness the Endeavour launch.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new era of space exploration that will contribute to
the well being of mankind,'' said Alain Dubeau, who manages the
development of the large robotic arm the Canadian Space Agency will
contribute to the station.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a starting point, everyone's dream come true,'' said
Hideo Takamatsu, who leads the Japanese Space Agency's development
of a research module and other scientific equipment. ``We will face
many challenges, but I believe we will get through them.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the obstacles are differences of culture, language and
economic means.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truly, we are not testing just hardware as part of this
program,'' said Mikhail Sinelschikov, chief of the Russian Space
Agency's financially handicapped human space program. ``We are
testing our relationship very much, and our mutual trust and our
confidence in each other.'' &QL;

</P>
<P>
   FEATURE story &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PEORIA-ARTS (Peoria, Ill.) _ When Richard Nixon asked, ``Will it
play in Peoria?'' he was taking the nation's temperature, checking
on the predilections of mainstream citizens. But he was also
reviving an adage from the early part of the century, when this was
a center of whisky production and an active vaudeville circuit
stop, and the farm folks were renowned as a particularly dour and
tough-to-please audience. When I echoed the question last month _
what I actually said was: ``So what plays in Peoria?'' _ the
occasion was a round-table discussion, organized at the request of
The New York Times, among representatives of local arts
organizations. The subject was the health of the arts here in this
conservative heartland city of 113,000 people on the Illinois
River. By Bruce Weber. &UR;  &LR; (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   FILM AND VIDEO
</P>
<P>
   EUROPE-FILM-SCIONS (subslug) (Undated) _ For the Italian actor
Alessandro Gassman, taking the lead role in ``Steam: The Turkish
Bath'' was the riskiest _ and maybe the smartest _ move of his
career. Gassman plays a married Italian designer who goes to
Istanbul to take care of his aunt's estate. While there, he
discovers the enticing culture of the Turkish bath _ and with it,
the realization that he is gay. His role in ``Steam,'' a thoughtful
and elegiac film by Ferzan Ozpetek, must have surprised some fans,
since Gassman was best known for a successful series of light
comedies in recent years. But his 76-year-old father was not
shocked; in fact, he encouraged the venture. After all, the father
is Vittorio Gassman, a fixture on the Italian stage and screen for
more than 50 years. By Ted Loos. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TWILIGHT-ZONE-VIDEO (Undated) _ The television writer and
producer Rod Serling died 23 years ago, but watching him in action
today is as engrossing as taking in one of his fanciful dramas.
Maybe more so. ``There is a fifth dimension,'' he says at the start
of each episode of ``The Twilight Zone,'' the famed science fiction
series that ran from 1959 to 1965 and was his signature. As caught
in ``Treasures of the Twilight Zone,'' a new pair of digital video
disks from Panasonic Interactive Media, Serling is a man of both
artistic and pragmatic dispositions. By Peter M. Nichols. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   DANCE
</P>
<P>
   MARTHA-GRAHAM-SATIRE (New York) _ Despite forensic evidence, the
modern-dance pioneer Martha Graham did not die in 1991. She can be
found performing, name dropping and introducing guest
choreographers the first Wednesday and Thursday of most months at a
club in Manhattan's meatpacking district. Oh, she also grew 16
inches and is often mistaken for a soft-spoken, witty man named
Richard Move. Martha(AT)Mother is the event, a satiric character
study of Graham as artist, diva and publicity hound _ all portrayed
by the 6-foot-4-inch Move in Graham drag _ as well as a loving
tribute to modern dance and its practitioners. By William Harris.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   THEATER
</P>
<P>
   DUET-THEATER (New York) _ With the bravado of youth, the Adobe
Theater Company, a nonprofit troupe that prefers to spell its name
in lowercase letters, shuns other unnecessary highs: high art,
high-handedness and _ until their recent transfer to the 170-seat
Actors Playhouse in Greenwich Village _ high overhead. But after
their critically acclaimed ``Duet!: A Romantic Fable,'' a pulpy
parody of puppy love and American culture, closed with sold-out
houses in SoHo last year, this Off Off Broadway troupe took the
leap to their first open-ended commercial run and reopened the play
Off Broadway. By Steven Drukman. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   CANBY-THEATER (Undated) _ Vincent Canby reviews: ``Waiting for
Godot''; ``Grimm Tales'' and ``Forbidden Broadway.'' (Moved).

</P>
<P>
   CLASSICAL
</P>
<P>
   ORPHEUS-CHAMBER-ORCHESTRA (Hanoi, Vietnam) _ The twain met here
last month, when the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, the conductorless
ensemble from New York, performed at the Hanoi Opera House.
Orpheus, which plays on Monday evening at Carnegie Hall, was the
first professional American orchestra to appear in this country
since the Vietnam War ended in 1975. The two sold-out concerts were
glittering affairs, attended by culture-starved expatriates and
curious Vietnamese, turned out in their dressiest Western-style
clothes. By Jamie James. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN-ARTS-CENTER (Undated) _ American arts centers, those
multipurpose, multicultural, multihalled institutions now dominate
the cultural scene, often in ways that have barely been recognized.
They are becoming as common as city halls, cost anywhere from $30
million to $200 million, and promise cultural rebirth and economic
vitality. The development of these centers may mark the most
dramatic change in the American performing arts landscape since
concert halls were built in the 19th century. By Edward Rothstein.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   POWDER-HER-FACE-OPERA (Undated) _ Thomas Ades' opera ``Powder
Her Face,'' which opens at the Majestic Theater of the Brooklyn
Academy of Music on Tuesday, the central character _ a Duchess,
anonymous but based on the Duchess of Argyll who gave Britain some
widely enjoyed scandal in the 1950s _ is being interviewed. Though
only 27, Ades has been relentlessly acclaimed in his native Britain
for nearly a decade, and the appetite for his music is now
international. By Paul Griffiths. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-AIDA (Shanghai) _ When enthusiastic applause erupted at
the final curtain for a recent production of Verdi's ``Aida,'' the
first opera to appear in Shanghai's sparklingly attractive new
opera house, Bonko Chan thought that he might collapse with a heart
attack. ``We only performed three nights, but that was enough for
me,'' said Chan, a freight-company executive who produced ``Aida''
in his spare time. ``I checked into a hospital with exhaustion.''
Bringing singers from Florence to pair them with dancers and
acrobats from Shanghai was a serious artistic and logistical
challenge in itself. But Chan had to add in the inevitable snafus
of a new performing-arts center, as well as countless political and
bureacratic land mines in a city where art is still dominated and
sometimes even strangled by officialdom. ``Aida'' was a critical
success, receiving well-deserved praise from Shanghai reviewers for
its captivating singing and lavish staging. By Seth Faison.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   POP MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   JAZZ-COMMERCIALS (Undated) _ No one would have guessed that
music once identified with the demimonde of smoky bars and drug
addicts would become mainstream, capable, at least in the minds of
advertisers, of selling almost anything. Yet, for the last few
years, that is exactly what has happened. ``Jazz is a great
untapped resource,'' said Peter Greco, senior vice president and
music director at the Young &AMP; Rubicam advertising agency. ``Its
freshness breaks through the clutter. We look to legends like Miles
Davis, Count Basie and John Coltrane for classicism.'' By Valerie
Gladstone. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   GREG-OSBY-JAZZ (Undated) _ One of the best jazz records of 1998
dares you, at first glance and listen, to take it seriously. Sold
in stores at a budget price, the alto saxophonist Greg Osby's
``Banned in New York'' is a live recording with one original tune
and a few standards, and aside from a little professional editing,
it was made for about $7. The music was captured on a small
minidisk recorder over the course of a few nights last winter at
Sweet Basil, a Manhattan club, with a single microphone placed in
front of the stage. By Ben Ratliff. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   ART
</P>
<P>
   BELLAGIO-HOTEL-ART (Las Vegas) _ This being Las Vegas, the art
gallery at Steve Wynn's new Bellagio Hotel was still open the other
night, at 11 o'clock, so I wandered in. Every day, I'm told, 1,800
people, which is the maximum number allowed, pay $10 to see what's
in the gallery's two small rooms (dark walls, spotlights on the
pictures). Half of them buy the $4 audio guides narrated by Wynn.
The crowds had thinned at night, which made it easier to see the
Brancusi and Giacometti sculptures and a big Franz Kline painting
called ``August Day.'' I mention those three works, among the
couple of dozen things on view, because the next morning, when I
returned to take another look, poof! They were gone. They'd been
sold and shipped out in the middle of the night. Hey, this is
Vegas. What do you expect? Novelty rules. By Michael Kimmelman.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ANTIQUES
</P>
<P>
   FANTASY-MACHINES-ANTIQUES (New York) _ At first glance, Steven
Montgomery's fantasy machines resemble the images that inspired
them _ metal engines rusting in Detroit junkyards and giant
electrical conduits snaking along the walls of tunnels and
stairwells in the subways of Lower Manhattan. Most of the machines
are huge, up to six feet long, while others are quite small, less
than a foot tall. Six of Montgomery's fictitious machines are on
exhibition at Ivan Karp's O.K. Harris gallery on West Broadway,
through Jan. 2. (They range in price from $3,500 to $22,000.) By
Rita Reif. (Moved).

 UNDATED: computer furniture.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brand-name machines, from Compaq, Dell, Gateway,
Hewlett-Packard, International Business Machines and others,
usually cost more but offer the security of technical support,
warranties and on-site service policies. Screwdriver shops often go
out of business without notice. Many people prefer to pay extra for
peace of mind.
</P>
<P>
   PC Magazine just released its annual survey results on customer
satisfaction. Only three makers of desktop computers earned an A
grade this year: IBM, Dell and Hewlett-Packard. For notebook
computers, the only As went to Dell and Gateway.
</P>
<P>
   Customers were asked to rate reliability, satisfaction with
repair experience, satisfaction with technical support and repair
frequency. The class clowns were Packard-Bell and AST Research.
</P>
<P>
   But enough general advice. Let's get down to the bitty gritty.
</P>
<P>
   A good salesman will ask, ``What do you want to do with the
computer?'' before making a specific recommendation. The trouble is
that people who have had limited exposure to computers often do not
know yet what a computer can do, much less what they want to do
with it.
</P>
<P>
   The safe route is to get a midrange machine _ a minivan _ that
is capable of doing most things well today and is capable of being
upgraded later, once a favorite task is identified.
</P>
<P>
   There is not room here to get into the Macintosh versus Windows
debate, except to note that an Apple Macintosh G3 can be set up to
run Windows software as well as Macintosh software. Still, more
than 9 out of 10 buyers will choose a Windows-only machine.
</P>
<P>
   Here are my minimum specifications for Windows-based machines:
</P>
<P>
   Processor: An Intel Pentium II with a speed of 350 megahertz or
higher. Or an AMD K6-2 processor rated 300 MHz or higher. Yes, it
is safe to buy a non-Intel processor. Frankly, lesser chips _ the
newest Intel Celerons, the older Pentiums with MMX, the AMD K6s,
the Cyrixes _ will all do fine for today's common applications.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pentium II 350 and higher and the K6-2 300s and higher
take advantage of a new and improved electronic plumbing system
built into better computers, technically called the 100-MHz
external bus, or PC-100 data bus.
</P>
<P>
   Older computers have a 66-MHz data bus. The faster data bus
makes most applications run faster, and it means that the owner can
upgrade to faster processors down the road.
</P>
<P>
   Memory: Microsoft asserts on its Web site that Windows 98 will
work on a computer with as little as 16 megabytes of system memory
(16 MB of RAM, or random access memory). Technically, that is true.
But technically, one can also play a round of golf with a 7-iron
and a putter.
</P>
<P>
   The experience is improved by having more clubs. (Except for my
game, of course, which would not suffer noticeably if I used a Coke
bottle, an umbrella and a pool cue.)
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, 64 MB is the practical minimum. Do not buy any
computer with less than 32 megabytes of RAM. Memory is very cheap
these days, so buy 128 MB if you can. Adding more RAM is the single
best improvement one can make to a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-disk drive: As long as software developers keep making
bloatware, you will need a bigger hard drive. Look for 6 gigabytes
(GB) or more.
</P>
<P>
   Monitor: The biggest you can afford.
</P>
<P>
   Modem: It must say V.90.
</P>
<P>
   Backup: The floppy disk is on its way to obsolescence. Consider
spending more for a Superdisk or a newer HiFD disk drive, which
works with older diskettes but offers much greater storage. As an
alternative, get a Zip drive or, better, a CD-R drive (which allows
you to write data onto a blank CD disk) to augment the floppy
drive.
</P>
<P>
   Fun: The low-end machines are not good for games. If games are
important, spend more for a better computer or get a separate Sony
Playstation. A DVD-ROM drive cannot record data, but it is a smart
alternative to a boring CD-ROM drive if you can afford it.
</P>
<P>
   You can still use your old CDs and install CD-based software,
and on higher-end systems you can also watch DVD movies. Yes, you
want a good set of speakers.

 By CLAIRE POOLE, with SERGIO R. BUSTOS in Miami 
 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Four years ago, Brazilian airline Varig was flying low.
 &HT;    The country's leading airline had been leasing aircraft using
Japanese financing since 1980. But it hadn't done anything to
protect itself from currency fluctuations. When the Brazilian
economy took a nose dive in early 1994, leading to a sinking
cruzado and runaway inflation, Varig couldn't pay the US$400
million due on 14 aircraft leases. If not for a massive
restructuring plan, the patience of its creditors (who became
shareholders) and some backup lease support from McDonnell Douglas
and General Electric, the airline would have gone under.
 &HT;    ``They could have easily insured themselves,'' says Marcelo
Martinelli, a consultant with Eurolatin, a Sao Paulo-based airline
consulting firm, ``but they didn't.''
 &HT;    It's hard for even the world's best economists to predict the
rise and fall of currencies around the world, especially in a
topsy-turvy region like Latin America. Mexico's 1994 peso
devaluation, for example, caught most economists, business
executives and citizens by surprise, creating a domino effect
across the region.
 &HT;    Now, after a couple of years of stability, Latin America's
currencies are again under attack, mostly due to the economic
fallout in Asia, political instability in Russia and nervousness in
the U.S. markets. On Sept. 2, less than one month after incoming
President Andres Pastrana assumed power, Colombia devalued its
currency, the peso, by 5 percent. Less than two weeks later,
Ecuador followed suit, allowing the sucre to fall by 10 percent,
the second time this year that the central bank devalued the
currency. Shortly thereafter, Peru started buying U.S. dollars to
protect its currency, the new sol. Many think Brazil, Venezuela and
Mexico may be next to devalue, despite assurances from their
respective leaders.
 &HT;    ``Brazil could make an adjustment to its currency by early
January,'' says Miguel A. Valdes, director of Ernst &AMP; Young LLP's
Latin American Business Center.
 &HT;    No matter what occurs, there are several actions companies can
take to protect themselves against currency fluctuations and
devaluations. Here are five:
 &HT;    HEDGING PROGRAMS: Hedging is a commonly used tool to offset
future currency fluctuations and protect the value of a company's
goods or services. The master of the hedge is Cemex, Mexico's
largest cement maker. With operations all over the world, from
South America to Spain to the Philippines, the Monterrey-based
company is extremely active in the capital markets. ``With [its]
debt so large and in so many different denominations, Cemex is the
most aggressive in terms of hedging,'' says Eduardo Cabrera, Latin
America equity strategist at U.S. investment house Merrill Lynch.
 &HT;    Argentine oil and industrial conglomerate Perez Companc has also
had some success using hedging techniques. This year the company
hedged 100 percent of its oil sales at $18 to $20 a barrel, a
pretty smart bet given soft oil prices and even softer currencies
across the region. ``That way, they can protect their cash flow in
case of a devaluation,'' says Frank McGann, Latin America oil and
gas analyst at Merrill Lynch in Buenos Aires.
 &HT;    But betting the wrong way can be very expensive. Argentine oil
giant YPF found that out a few years ago, when it wagered that oil
prices would remain at $20. They ended up shooting up to $24.72.
The bet cost the company $40 million.
 &HT;    ``We did a study on the long-term effects of hedging and found
out that half the time people were right and half the time people
were wrong,'' says Eduardo Dutrey, an investor relations manager at
YPF. ``So we decided the best hedge was to be as efficient as we
can be.''
 &HT;    Small to mid-sized companies should beware of hedging programs.
These techniques are expensive, with premiums ranging from 12
percent to 20 percent on the risk. Bill Zink, an international tax
partner at U.S.-based accounting firm Grant Thornton, recommends
hedging programs only for large, well-capitalized, multinational
companies. One of his clients, which makes machine tool parts in
Brazil, tried to join a hedging program at three different banks.
But the premiums, which were averaging in the teens, would have
killed them. ``Hedges aren't an easy answer,'' he says.
 &HT;    STICK WITH DOLLAR-BASED DEBT: After Mexico's devaluation,
companies that had peso-denominated debt got hammered, having to
pay ballooning interest rates. Those with dollar-based debt had to
generate more pesos to pay off their notes, but over the long term
they paid less because of a lower interest rate. ``Dollar debt is
so much cheaper long term and so much more reliable,'' says
Christopher Taylor, a Latin America fixed-income analyst at BT.
Alex Brown, a U.S.-based investment firm. ``If it's long-term debt,
you have a natural hedge because inflation always catches up with
devaluation. Any company that still has local-currency debt has a
foolish capital structure.''
 &HT;    For an extra level of comfort, many Latin American companies
hedge their dollar-based debt by swapping dollar contracts for
local currency contracts. That's what pan-regional bottler Panamco
and Mexican juice company Jugos del Valle did before the Mexican
peso devaluation and, as a result, their net earnings weren't as
impacted. Other Mexican beverage companies that didn't hedge, such
as Gemex, Femsa and Coca-Cola Femsa, saw their net earnings turn
into huge net losses. It took them years to catch up. Despite what
happened, Gemex and Femsa were still not hedged as of the end of
the second quarter.
 &HT;    Taking a page from Panamco's book, Brazilian brewer Brahma is
hedging its short-term, mostly dollar-based debt by swapping dollar
contracts for local currency contracts, paying the cost up front.
And Chilean bottler Andina is hedging its dollar-based notes by
investing in U.S. money-market instruments. ``While Andina has been
carrying a 200 negative-basis point spread, this has mitigated its
currency risk,'' says Laura D. Meizler, a Latin America food and
beverage analyst at New York investment firm Salomon Smith Barney.
 &HT;    RAISE PRICES: Often, the best way to prepare for a devaluation
is to simply raise prices. Panamco recently did that in Venezuela,
where it bought the soft drink operations from the Cisneros Group
and converted them from Pepsi to Coca-Cola. The only risk is that
your competitor might cut prices, stealing customers. Luckily for
Panamco, Pepsi has followed its competitor's pricing policies.
 &HT;    NEGOTIATE ALL YOUR CONTRACTS IN DOLLARS: That's not a problem
for domestic or foreign manufacturers supplying many of the larger
U.S. players in Latin America, such as the big auto makers. But
many of the larger companies in the region have become
multinational players themselves and may agree to sign deals in
something other than their local currency. ``Many U.S. companies
are afraid to ask their customers to agree to this,'' Grant
Thornton's Zink says, ``but it pays to try. They're often much more
willing to agree than you might expect.''
 &HT;    EXPORT WHEN POSSIBLE AND IN DOLLARS: For example, U.S.-based
diaper company Drypers has to buy much of its wood pulp from U.S.
suppliers for its manufacturing operations in Mexico. To counteract
its dollar-based raw materials costs with its peso-based sales,
Drypers is exporting as much excess production as possible to
Andean countries such as Venezuela, which have been willing to pay
in dollars. ``It's a natural hedge and it's cost free,'' says Wally
Klemp, chairman of Drypers.
 &HT;    Unfortunately, the company hasn't been able to do the same in
Brazil, where demand is brisk and supplies are tight. ``It's not
always possible,'' Klemp says. ``But where we can, we try to get as
much receivables as payables in dollars.''
 &HT;    One thing Drypers does do: The company estimates the next year's
currency devaluation and accrues the difference over the year.
``The real risk is if there's more of a devaluation than world
economists think,'' Klemp says.
 &HT;    If you're a foreign company considering setting up operations in
the region, Grant Thornton's Zink recommends you either link up or
sign a licensing agreement with a local company. That way, you can
give them the capital and/or technology they need and they will
take on all the currency risk. ``In Brazil, the ones that are
getting clobbered are not partnering,'' he says.
 &HT;    Companies already operating in Latin America should consider
scaling back. One of Zink's clients, a manufacturer of industrial
parts, recently pulled its Brazilian operations and is now
licensing its process to a local company. Contract manufacturing in
dollars would have been another way to go.
 &HT;    In Varig's case, the Brazilian airline could have avoided its
problems four years ago with the use of such financial tools as
overnight accounts, whose rates are adjusted daily to hedge against
inflation. It could also have developed a faster revenue-collection
system. Or it could have avoided the problem entirely by not
leasing the planes in a currency from a country located halfway
around the world.
 &HT;    The airline has learned its lesson. It just signed a new leasing
agreement for 39 jets, none of which were financed in yen. ``We
don't do that anymore,'' Varig spokesman Marcelo Lima says. ``That
was in the past.'' In these uncertain times, that was probably a
smart move.

 Por CLAIRE POOLE, con SERGIO R. BUSTOS en Miami 
 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Hace cuatro anos, la aerolinea brasilena Varig volaba bajo.
 &HT;    Desde 1980, la principal linea aerea del pais arrendaba aviones
con financiacion japonesa. Pero no habia hecho nada para protegerse
de las fluctuaciones de la moneda. Cuando la economia brasilena
cayo en picado a principios de 1994, con el consiguiente naufragio
del cruzado y el alza desaforada de la inflacion, Varig no pudo
pagar los US$400 millones que debia por 14 contratos de
arrendamiento de aviones. De no haber sido por un vasto plan de
reestructuracion, la paciencia de sus acreedores (que se
convirtieron en accionistas) y cierto respaldo en los
arrendamientos por parte de McDonnell Douglas y General Electric,
la aerolinea habria desaparecido.
 &HT;    ``Podrian haberse asegurado ellos mismos facilmente,'' senala
Marcelo Martinelli, consultor de Eurolatin, una firma de asesoria
de aerolineas radicada en Sao Paulo. ``Pero no lo hicieron.''
 &HT;    Hasta para los mejores economistas es dificil pronosticar los
altibajos de las monedas, sobre todo en una region como America
Latina. La devaluacion del peso mexicano en 1994, por ejemplo, tomo
por sorpresa a la mayoria de los economistas, ejecutivos y
ciudadanos, y creo un efecto domino en la region. Tras un par de
anos de estabilidad, las monedas latinoamericanas estan otra vez
bajo asedio, debido a la crisis economica de Asia, la inestabilidad
politica en Rusia y el nerviosismo de los mercados norteamericanos.
El 2 de septiembre, menos de un mes despues que el presidente
Andres Pastrana asumio el poder, Colombia devaluo el peso en el 5
por ciento. Menos de dos semanas despues, Ecuador dio el mismo paso
al permitir que el sucre cayera el 10 por ciento, la segunda vez en
lo que va de ano. Poco despues, Peru comenzo a comprar dolares para
proteger su moneda, el sol. Muchos piensan que Brasil, Venezuela y
Mexico podrian ser los proximos en devaluar. ``Brasil podria hacer
un ajuste a su moneda para principios de enero,'' dice Miguel A.
Valdes, director del Centro de Negocios Latinoamericanos de Ernst &AMP;
Young LLP.
 &HT;    Hay varias cosas que las empresas pueden hacer para protegerse
de estos altibajos. Cinco de esas medidas son:
 &HT;    1. Programas de compensacion de riesgo. El maestro de la
compensacion de riesgo es Cemex, el mayor fabricante mexicano de
cemento. Con operaciones en todo el mundo, esta empresa de
Monterrey esta muy activa en los mercados de capital. ``Con una
deuda tan grande y en tantas denominaciones, Cemex es la mas activa
en el terreno de la compensacion de riesgo,'' afirma Eduardo
Cabrera, especialista en estrategia del banco de inversion Merrill
Lynch, de Nueva York.
 &HT;    El conglomerado petrolero e industrial argentino Perez Companc
tambien ha tenido cierto exito. Este ano la empresa cubrio el 100
por ciento de sus ventas de petroleo entre US$18 y US$20 el barril,
un paso muy astuto ante los bajos precios del petroleo y las
divisas aun mas debiles en la region. ``De esa manera, pueden
proteger su flujo de efectivo en caso de una devaluacion,'' dice
Frank McGann, analista de petroleo y gas en America Latina para
Merrill Lynch en Buenos Aires.
 &HT;    Pero equivocarse en la apuesta puede resultar muy costoso. El
coloso petrolero argentino YPF descubrio esa realidad hace unos
anos, cuando calculo que los precios del petroleo se quedarian en
US$20. Al final se dispararon a US$24,72. La apuesta costo US$40
millones a la compania.
 &HT;    ``Hicimos un estudio en los efectos a largo plazo de la
compensacion de riesgo y hallamos que la gente tenia razon el 50
por ciento de las veces,'' dice Eduardo Dutrey, gerente de
relaciones con inversionistas de YPF. ``De modo que decidimos que
la mejor cobertura seria alcanzar el mayor grado posible de
eficiencia.''
 &HT;    Las companias pequenas y medianas deben tener cuidado con los
programas de compensacion de riesgo. Estas tecnicas son costosas, y
las primas oscilan entre el 12 por ciento y el 20 por ciento del
riesgo. Bill Zink, de la firma estadounidense de contabilidad Grant
Thornton, recomienda programas de compensacion solo a
multinacionales grandes y bien capitalizadas. Uno de sus clientes,
que fabrica piezas para maquinaria en Brasil, trato de adquirir
compensacion de riesgo en tres bancos. Pero no podia costear las
primas, que rondaban el 15 por ciento. ``La compensacion de riesgo
no es una respuesta facil,'' dice Zink.
 &HT;    2. Quedarse con deuda en dolares. Tras la devaluacion en Mexico,
las empresas con deuda en pesos sufrieron un fuerte golpe al tener
que pagar altas tasas de interes. Las que tenian deudas en dolares
tuvieron que generar mas pesos para pagar sus cuentas, pero a largo
plazo pagaron menos porque sus tasas de interes eran mas bajas.
``La deuda en dolares es mucho menos costosa a largo plazo y mucho
mas confiable,'' indica Christopher Taylor, analista de ingresos
fijos en America Latina para BT. Alex Brown, una firma de inversion
de EU. ``Si la deuda es a largo plazo, se tiene una cobertura
natural porque la inflacion siempre se nivela con la devaluacion.
Cualquier empresa que tenga deuda en moneda local tiene una
estructura de capital disparatada.''
 &HT;    Para mayor comodidad, muchas empresas latinoamericanas protegen
sus deudas en dolares cambiando contratos en dolares por contratos
en moneda local. Eso fue lo que hicieron la embotelladora regional
Panamco y la empresa mexicana Jugos del Valle antes de la
devaluacion del peso mexicano y, como resultado, sus ingresos netos
no sufrieron tanto. Otras companias mexicanas de bebidas que no se
cubrieron, como Gemex, Femsa y Coca-Cola Femsa, tuvieron enormes
perdidas y les tomo anos recuperarse. A pesar de lo sucedido, Gemex
y Femsa todavia no estaban cubiertas al finalizar el segundo
trimestre.
 &HT;    Copiando la estrategia de Panamco, la cervecera brasilena Brahma
protege su deuda a corto plazo, mayormente en dolares, cambiando
contratos en dolares por contratos en moneda local y pagando el
costo por adelantado. Y la embotelladora chilena Andina protege sus
deudas en dolares invirtiendo en instrumentos monetarios de EU.
``Aunque Andina ha tenido una dispersion negativa de 200 puntos
base, esto ha aliviado su riesgo monetario,'' dice Laura D.
Meizler, analista de alimentos y bebidas de America Latina en la
firma de inversion Salomon Smith Barney, de Nueva York.
 &HT;    3. Subir los precios. Muchas veces la mejor manera de prepararse
para una devaluacion es subir los precios. Panamco lo hizo hace
poco en Venezuela, donde compro las operaciones de refrescos del
Grupo Cisneros y las paso de Pepsi a Coca-Cola. El unico riesgo es
que el competidor puede reducir los precios y robarse clientes.
 &HT;    4. Negociar todos sus contratos en dolares. Eso no es un
problema para los fabricantes nacionales o extranjeros que
abastecen a muchas de las grandes empresas norteamericanas en
America Latina, como los fabricantes de automoviles. Pero gran
parte de las mayores empresas de la region se han convertido en
multinacionales y pueden aceptar acuerdos que no sean en moneda
local. ``Muchas firmas norteamericanas temen preguntar a sus
clientes si aceptarian un convenio que no sea en la divisa local,''
senala Zink, de Grant Thornton, ``pero vale la pena probar. Muchas
veces estan mas dispuestas a aceptar mas de lo que uno cree.''
 &HT;    5. Cuando sea posible, exporte, y en dolares. Por ejemplo, la
compania norteamericana de panales Drypers tiene que comprar gran
parte de su pulpa a suministradores norteamericanos para sus
operaciones en Mexico. Para compensar sus costos de materia prima
en dolares con las ventas en pesos, Drypers exporta toda la
produccion excedente que puede a paises sudamericanos dispuestos a
pagar en dolares. ``Es una proteccion natural y es gratis,'' dice
Wally Klemp, presidente del directorio de Drypers.
 &HT;    Desafortunadamente, la empresa no ha podido hacer lo mismo en
Brasil, donde la demanda es fuerte y el suministro no abunda. ``No
siempre se puede,'' dice Klemp. ``Pero donde podemos tratamos de
conseguir la mayor cantidad posible de cuentas por pagar y por
cobrar en dolares.''
 &HT;    Ademas, Drypers calcula la posible devaluacion del ano siguiente
y acumula la diferencia durante el ano. ``El riesgo real es si hay
una devaluacion mayor de lo que piensan los economistas,'' dice
Klemp.
 &HT;    A las companias extranjeras que consideran iniciar operaciones
en la region, Zink, de Grant Thornton, les recomienda que
establezcan un acuerdo de concesion de licencia con una empresa
local. De esa manera, la empresa extranjera le puede dar a la
compania local el capital o la tecnologia que necesita, y la
empresa local asumira todo el riesgo monetario. ``En Brasil, los
mas golpeados son los que no se asocian,'' afirma.
 &HT;    Las empresas que ya operan en America Latina deben considerar
una reduccion. Uno de los clientes de Zink, un fabricante de piezas
industriales, retiro recientemente sus operaciones de Brasil y
ahora da la licencia del proceso a una empresa local. La
manufactura por contrato en dolares habria sido otra opcion.
 &HT;    En el caso de Varig, la aerolinea pudo haberse evitado los
problemas hace cuatro anos con el uso de instrumentos financieros
como las cuentas al dia, cuyas tasas se ajustan diariamente con el
fin de protegerse contra la inflacion. Tambien pudo haber
desarrollado un sistema de cobro mas rapido. O pudo haber eludido
el problema por completo no arrendando sus aviones en una moneda de
un pais situado al otro lado del mundo. La aerolinea ha aprendido
la leccion. Hace poco firmo un acuerdo de arrendamiento de 39
aviones, y ninguno esta financiado en yenes. ``Ya no hacemos eso,''
afirma Marcelo Lima, portavoz de Varig. ``Eso fue en el pasado.''
En estos tiempos de incertidumbre, Varig probablemente dio un paso
inteligente.

NEW U.S. LAW ON TORTURE ABROAD IS FOCUS OF DEPORTATION CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Md.)  (bl) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ A Nigerian widow who says she and her
11-year-old daughter face sexual abuses if they are forced to
return to her homeland has asked to stay in the United States under
new legislation that makes an international convention against
torture part of U.S. law.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Virginia Anikwata, who has been battling to stay in
the United States for 10 years on various grounds after the death
of her husband, a student, will have a hearing Friday on her new
claim in Arlington, Va., according to her lawyer in Washington,
Morton Sklar.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Anikwata says that if she returns to Nigeria she will become
the shared property of her late husband's extended family and that
her daughter, Chinedu Sharon, a U.S. citizen, will face genital
cutting, known widely in Africa as female circumcision. Immigration
law no longer automatically allows an immigrant to remain in the
United States with a child who is a citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Sklar said Ms. Anikwata's case built on a precedent set by
Fauziya Kassindja, an illegal immigrant from Togo who was given
asylum in the United States in 1996 based on her fear of having to
undergo genital cutting if she returned.
</P>
<P>
   In Ms. Anikwata's case, however, she is asking for protection
for herself and the girl, and she is not using asylum procedures
but legislation enacted by Congress in October. That law provides
automatic protection against deportation for people who file claims
under the 1984 United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other
Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The United
States ratified the convention in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Sklar, director of the U.S. branch of the independent World
Organization Against Torture, said the process could take a year to
complete in hearings under the antitorture law. In that time Ms.
Anikwata will be permitted to work and cannot be deported.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kassindja case established the right of a woman not to go
back to a situation where she would be subjected to FGM,'' Sklar
said, using a shorthand expression for female genital mutilation.
``What's unique about this case is that for the first time it deals
with whether a parent can use this protection on behalf of a child.
The Immigration and Naturalization Service has not recognized that
right yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The protection of children, especially girls, is becoming an
issue in more immigration and asylum cases, and judges have
considerable flexibility in considering pleas. On Nov. 5 an
immigration judge in New York allowed an Indian couple to stay in
the United States on the ground that their two daughters, both U.S.
citizens, could not be expected to develop well under the hardships
of India.
</P>
<P>
   A campaign on Ms. Anikwata's behalf has been led by Equality
Now, a New York human rights organization that helps women in the
developing world and immigrants in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want courts in this country to recognize that girls from
countries where the practice of female genital mutilation takes
place are at risk and that their mothers are very likely not going
to be able to protect them,'' said Jessica Neuwirth, a lawyer who
is president of Equality Now.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Neuwirth said it was also outrageous that immigration
officials had suggested that Ms. Anikwata should leave her daughter
behind if she is fearful of her fate in Nigeria. They have no
relatives in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Anikwata, 36, married Godfrey Anikwata in Nigeria in 1986
and moved with him to the University of Maryland, where he was a
student. Anikwata was found to have terminal lung cancer and died
in September 1987, when their only child, Chinedu Sharon, was 2
months old. With her husband's death, Ms. Anikwata lost her right
to remain in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The family of the late Mr. Anikwata, Ibos like Ms. Anikwata, has
been demanding that she return to Nigeria to become part of the
extended clan and bear other children by male relatives, she said
in an affidavit. After having lived in the United States she did
not want to live under that arrangement. She also has other fears.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a male dies and has only one child that child becomes the
property of the husband's family,'' Ms. Anikwata wrote in the
affidavit. ``I do not want her to have to face an uprooted life, to
have to live with persons and a culture she does not know, to see
her mother having to commit acts against her principles and, most
of all, to endure female circumcision, which will surely be her
fate.''

STEM CELL RESEARCH IS VITAL, EXPERTS TELL SENATE PANEL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Iowa.)  (htv) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In unusually emphatic and optimistic terms,
scientists told a Senate hearing Wednesday that research with human
embryonic cells was likely to yield important medical benefits and
should be supported by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not too unrealistic to say that this research has the
potential to revolutionize the practice of medicine and improve the
quality and length of life,'' said Dr. Harold Varmus, director of
the National Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing, the scientists who announced last month that
they had isolated and cultured the cells explained how they could
be grown into any desired tissue of the body and used to treat
almost any disease, particularly those like Parkinson's disease and
juvenile diabetes that are caused by deficiency of a specific type
of cell.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is almost no realm of medicine that might not be touched
by this innovation,'' Varmus said.
</P>
<P>
   But use of the human embryonic stem cells also raises ethical
issues. The cells are widely regarded as meriting a special moral
status. They are close cousins to the fertilized egg, although they
cannot by themselves develop into an infant.
</P>
<P>
   Among a panel of ethicists who followed the scientists, some
said that the practical benefits of treatments using the cells
should outweigh moral qualms about their use, but Richard M.
Doerflinger, of the National conference of Catholic Bishops, said
that ``scientific progress must not come at the expense of human
dignity'' and warned against use of the cells unless they had been
derived from spontaneously aborted fetuses.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the hearing, held by the Appropriations
subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, the Senate
committee that approves funding for federal biomedical research,
was to explore the implications of the new research in light of the
ban on using federal funds for embryo research. The ban,
originating on the House side, has been attached to appropriations
bills for the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   The human embryonic stem cells described last month were
developed by academic scientists who were supported by Geron Corp.
and received no federal funding. University scientists, who receive
most of their support from the National Institutes of Health, would
like to work with the cells but will not be able to do so unless
the federal ban on financing of embryo research is lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently hoping that the ban will not be introduced for a
fourth year, Varmus and other scientific witnesses were unusually
eloquent in describing the expected benefits of embryonic stem cell
research.
</P>
<P>
   These cells are the all-purpose genetic material from which all
of the body's tissues are molded. In the womb, the embryonic cells
develop naturally into the highly organized set of tissues that
constitute a living infant. Now that the cells can for the first
time be cultured in the laboratory, scientists hope to channel them
into any desired type of cell, replacing or relieving the need for
transplantable donor organs and providing novel treatments for many
other kinds of disease.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas Okarma, Geron's vice president for research, said
embryonic stem cells were a potential source of:
</P>
<P>
   _ heart muscle cells to treat congestive heart failure;
</P>
<P>
   _ blood-forming cells to help cancer patients whose own bone
marrow cells had been damaged by chemotherapy;
</P>
<P>
   _ cells to line the inside of blood vessels, to treat
atherosclerosis;
</P>
<P>
   _ insulin-producing cells to cure those with insulin-dependent
diabetes;
</P>
<P>
   _ nerve and brain cells to treat patients with Parkinson's and
Alzheimer's disease and victims of stroke.
</P>
<P>
   The two scientists whose embryonic stem cell work was funded by
Geron, Dr. James A. Thomson of the University of Wisconsin in
Madison and Dr. John Gearhart of Johns Hopkins University, offered
similarly optimistic testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Though Geron has a strong commercial interest in advertising the
value of the cells, on whose use it owns an exclusive license, the
company's general position on the wide applicability of the cells
was supported by Varmus, an eminent biologist.
</P>
<P>
   When Sen. Arlen Specter, R.-Pa., pressed the scientists to say
how soon treatments using the cells might be available, Thomson
said therapy for Parkinson's could be expected in five to 10 years,
and Gearhart predicted seven to 12 years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Scientists usually decline to predict the date of prospective
treatments because many results that seem promising in the
laboratory stumble before reaching the marketplace, and regulatory
delays are equally unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   But even this enthusiastic panel of researchers became
resolutely noncommittal when Specter asked, ``Do we have a
realistic fountain of youth with this technique?''
</P>
<P>
   At least two major obstacles remain to be overcome before any
possible stem cell treatments emerge. One is that biologists have
not yet identified the natural signals that are assumed to govern
the differentiation of embryonic cells in the body.
</P>
<P>
   Another is that the developed cells produced from the embryonic
stem cells will be rejected unless they can somehow be genetically
manipulated so as to avoid provoking the patient's immune defenses.
Varmus said that ``these technical challenges, though significant,
are not insurmountable.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the derivation and use of human embryonic stem cells raise
unaccustomed ethical questions, ones that President Clinton last
month asked the National Bioethics Advisory Commission to address.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson derived his cells from pre-implantation embryos that had
been created in fertility clinics and would otherwise have been
discarded. The embryos, at that stage a small blob of cells known
as a blastocyst, had been frozen for several years. The cells
Gearhart used came from aborted fetuses, from a region destined to
form the egg or sperm cells.
</P>
<P>
   Doerflinger, representing the Catholic position, objected to any
research that involved the creation or destruction of an embryo for
research purposes, which in his view included the cells Thomson
used, and, in practice, those used by Gearhart.
</P>
<P>
   But he said Gearhart's method might be acceptable if it were
applied only to spontaneously aborted fetuses, depending on whether
or not the method creates human embryos. ``I think the answer is
no, but I don't know and I don't think anyone knows,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Varmus said he believed that Gearhart's research probably could
have been funded by the National Institutes of Health, despite the
ban, but that he was awaiting a ruling from the office of general
counsel in the Department of Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   Many biologists are eager to start research on the human
embryonic stem cells but will have to wait a little while yet.
Although Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said at the hearing that he
thought even the cells used by Thomson did not fall under the
federal funding ban, Specter said afterwards that he was not yet
ready to reach a judgment on whether research of the sort Gearheart
conducted could be federally funded.
</P>
<P>
   Okarma said that Geron would make the cells freely available for
research purposes.

FROM TV'S ARCHIVES, 15 THAT GOT AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some of TV's best shows ever died young and left handsome
corpses.
</P>
<P>
   They make up our list of all-time top flops _ shows that were
canceled too soon but buried with full creative honors.
</P>
<P>
   Better that than to live in infamy, in the scruffy company of
two-time Nielsen ratings champ ``The Beverly Hillbillies.''
</P>
<P>
   Television's all-time favorite failure is none other than ``Star
Trek,'' which broke free from the grave and mother-shipped a
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   True, ``Star Trek'' wasn't axed after a month, or even a season.
But it was hard-pressed to last from 1966 into the 1968-69 season,
leaving behind those eternal 79 episodes.
</P>
<P>
   To the NBC brass, ``Star Trek'' was a fanciful clunker with a
small but rabid fan base. If it had had the stuff of a true hit, it
would have knocked CBS' ``Gomer Pyle'' out of the box. It didn't,
and it died, only to fulfill its phenomenal Lazarus destiny in the
world of syndicated reruns.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us can recall an attachment to some prematurely canceled
series. ``My So-Called Life,'' maybe. ``The Days and Nights of
Molly Dodd.'' Or last season's ``Nothing Sacred.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is one critic's list of 14 other shows that were canceled
in their youth _ usually the first season _ but deserved longer
runs.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``The Ernie Kovacs Show,'' &LR;  CBS, 1952-53. Kovacs could always
get noticed, but he never had a national hit. And yet he was the
inventive comedian who broke from the radio-with-pictures mold and
used the techniques of television itself _ including video tricks
and blackouts _ to get laughs. Among the regular features were the
ape-suited Nairobi Trio, the lisping poet Percy Dovetonsils, singer
(and Kovacs' wife) Edie Adams and all manner of people emerging
from a single bathtub.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``East Side, West Side,'' &LR;  CBS, 1963-64. Starring George C.
Scott as New York social worker Neil Brock, it lasted one gritty
and ratings-impaired season. It was a period of high idealism and
grand social shifts in American life, but TV viewers apparently
weren't ready to see urban social problems, including race
relations, dramatized in a weekly series.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``The Paper Chase,'' &LR;  CBS, 1978-79. Based on the novel and
1973 movie, the series starred James Stephens as a first-year
student at a prestigious Eastern law school and John Houseman as
the legendary law professor who was especially adept at terrorizing
first-year students. The drama was a favorite of CBS chairman
William Paley. And (set ital)still(end ital) it was canceled for
anemic ratings. But like ``Star Trek,'' it found a new lease
elsewhere. Showtime cable picked up the series for what would
become 36 new episodes. It was the first such network-to-cable
transfer.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``The Associates,'' &LR;  ABC, 1979-80. Way too slick for the ABC
of 1979. ``Laverne &AMP; Shirley'' and ``Happy Days,'' sure, but this
was a smart, attractively produced comedy about lawyers. The main
characters were three youthful associates at a Wall Street legal
firm headed by the ever-so-slightly senile Emerson Marshall
(Wilfrid Hyde-White). One of the associates, Tucker Kerwin, was
played by a relatively unknown Canadian comic, Martin Short. The
show was mainly a victim of scheduling. It was slotted after ``Mork
&AMP; Mindy'' on Sunday nights, when ABC foolishly decided that Robin
Williams could finish off Archie Bunker.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``United States,'' &LR;  NBC, 1980. First telecast, March 11.
Final telecast, April 29. That's grim. But this comedy from Larry
Gelbart was a ground-breaker anyway. Starring Beau Bridges and
Helen Shaver, it downplayed jokes and tried to mix comedy and drama
in the course of examining the tribulations of a modern marriage.
Viewers apparently found it grim and preachy. And, in truth, it
doesn't stand up well to time. But for 1980, it was daring adult
television.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Bosom Buddies,'' &LR;  ABC, 1980-1982. It hung around for a
season and a half, but it was touch-and-go all the way. The idea
was that two desperate male roommates had to masquerade as women to
live in a New York residential hotel for women. ``Bosom Buddies''
relied too heavily on cheap laughs and short towels for the boys'
new gal pals. But the stars had talent and chemistry. One was Peter
Scolari, pre-``Newhart.'' The other was Tom Hanks, pre-everything.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Bay City Blues,'' &LR;  NBC, 1983. That's October 1983 and
November 1983. Co-created by Steven Bochco, it was a one-hour drama
about life with a minor-league baseball team, the Bay City (Calif.)
Bluebirds. Guess what; there's never been a hit TV series about
baseball. And this show had an amazing distinction; every single
quarter hour it was on the air, its ratings declined from the
previous quarter hour. That's failure, and yet ``Bay City Blues''
was a good, textured show. The cast included Michael Nouri, Pat
Corley, Bernie Casey, Dennis Franz, Michele Greene, Ken Olin, Peter
Jurasik, Sheree North and, as the wife of the bed-wetting star
pitcher, Sharon Stone.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``The `Slap' Maxwell Story,'' &LR;  ABC, 1987-88. It was somewhere
in the middle of Dabney Coleman's string of TV flops, after the
better-remembered ``Buffalo Bill.'' The show was also a dramedy, a
drama-comedy hybrid that's never quite sprouted in Nielsen soil.
Coleman adroitly balanced the laughs and pathos as an acerbic
sports columnist for a little newspaper in New Mexico. Splendidly
written and acted, the show failed to survive for a full season.
Among the other cast members were Megan Gallagher as Slap's
girlfriend, Susan Anspach as his ex-wife and Bill Cobbs as a bar
proprietor.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``A Year in the Life,'' &LR;  NBC, 1987-88. NBC's programming
chief, the late Brandon Tartikoff, swore that this cancellation
really hurt. It should have hurt. Spawned by a 1986 miniseries, the
intelligent and realistic drama series was about a Seattle widower
and businessman (Richard Kiley) and his four grown children.
Viewers seemed to mistake it for educational television. So
producers Joshua Brand and John Falsey, fresh from ``St.
Elsewhere,'' were forced to pack and move on to their next big
project, ``Northern Exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Twin Peaks,'' &LR;  ABC, 1990-91. It's an anomaly among these
vaunted failures. Everything else was killed off. ``Twin Peaks''
amounted to a suicide. The David Lynch-Mark Frost series premiered
to critical raves, a ready-made reputation for hipness and decent
ratings. Then, over the next year, the producers ran it into the
ground. The show bogged down in confusion, tangents and surrealism
when it should have advanced the continuing story line of Laura
Palmer's murder. But when it was good, ``Twin Peaks'' could elicit
a giggle, a shudder and a ``huh?'' almost simultaneously. Certainly
coffee and cherry pie will never be the same again. Such a
squandered opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Middle Ages,'' &LR;  CBS, 1992. Would Baby Boomers watch a TV
series that reminded them they were getting older? Absolutely not;
``Middle Ages'' lasted less than a month. And the show had so much
to say, most of it revolving around the humdrum life of a
43-year-old traveling salesman (Peter Riegert) in the throes of a
midlife crisis. Sexual dysfunction, insecurities, career stall,
corporate downsizing _ it was all here. Nice cast, too. Besides
Riegert, there were William Russ, Michael O'Keefe, James Gammon,
Amy Brenneman, Kyle Secor and Maria Pitillo.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Profit,'' &LR;  Fox, 1996. Adrian Pasdar was Jack Profit, the
company's junior vice president for acquisitions. He was also a
psychopath who'd been raised in a cardboard moving box, where he
could watch TV through a peephole. This sardonic series simply
teemed with nasty metaphors for our times. It was probably on the
wrong network. Or maybe Rupert Murdoch saw something of himself
here and got spooked. Too bad.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``EZ Streets,'' &LR;  CBS, 1996-97. Producer Paul Haggis created
his own pea-soup world of public and private corruption in the
decaying heart of a Rust Belt city. So OK, it wasn't exactly
designed to be a huge hit. But the drama, which starred Ken Olin,
certainly deserved better than it got. Joe Pantoliano was wonderful
as a mob boss on the make. In one pilot scene, he made small talk
while he and a dim-witted underling (Mike Starr) rummaged through
severed hands in a freezer, looking for just the right fingerprint
to attach to a murder weapon.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Lateline,'' &LR;  NBC, 1998. It's not dead yet. But it's not on
the air, either, and worrying is encouraged. In his comedy send-up
of a ``Nightline''-like news show, Al Franken was Al Freundlich,
schlemiel and overly sincere network news correspondent. In its few
weeks on the air to date, ``Lateline'' already contributed a
classic half hour in which the labor story Freundlich has nursed to
air is pre-empted in favor of a premature obituary for Buddy
Hackett.

SHUTTLE CREW EMBARKS ON DANGEROUS, MOMENTOUS MISSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The space shuttle Endeavour is poised for a liftoff before dawn
Thursday morning on a mission expected to be among the most
difficult and complex since shuttles began flying in 1981 _ and a
mission that is to usher in a whole new era for humans in space.
</P>
<P>
   If the mission goes as planned, the first two sections of the
planned $60 billion International Space Station will be placed in
orbit and joined, and briefly occupied by astronauts connecting
their power and data cables. It will be the beginning of the
assembly of by far the largest structure ever built in space, and
the first one to involve so much international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   When completed _ in 2004, under the current schedule _ the space
station will extend over an area almost as large as three football
fields, and its laboratory and living modules will have as much
room as two Boeing 747 jumbojets. That's a big leap from the Apollo
days of the late '60s, when astronauts worked in a capsule about
the size of a Volkswagen beetle.
</P>
<P>
   Already postponed for a year because of Russia's delays in
completing its key modules, the planned 3:56 a.m. launch may be
delayed again for a more typical reason: bad weather expected at
Cape Canaveral and at emergency landing sites in Spain and Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force meteorologist Ed Priselac said there was only a 40
percent chance the weather would cooperate for the predawn launch;
the odds are equally bad for Friday morning. That means getting the
shuttle off the ground ``is going to be a crapshoot'' either day,
Priselac said. There is a 60 percent chance of acceptable weather
Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   And because this mission requires a pinpoint rendezvous in orbit
with a Russian station module called Zarya (sunrise), launched two
weeks ago, the launch window is an unusually brief 10 minutes. But
because of the unusual orbit required, the shuttle should be
visible from most of the East Coast as it climbs into orbit powered
by three hydrogen-burning main engines. Its brighter-burning solid
rocket boosters, which only last for about two minutes, will have
been jettisoned before it comes into view here.
</P>
<P>
   Once in orbit, the shuttle will spend three days chasing the
Zarya module in a delicately choreographed series of moves,
eventually closing to within just 600 feet. Then, astronaut Nancy
Currie will use the shuttle's robot arm to lift a US-made
connecting module called Unity out of the shuttle's cargo bay and
connect it to an airlock attached to the crew cabin.
</P>
<P>
   Then, shuttle commander Robert Cabana will begin a slow, careful
maneuver to line up the 18-foot-long, 15-foot-diameter Unity module
with Zarya, nudging it slowly close enough for the two crafts'
docking rings to connect.
</P>
<P>
   When this difficult space ballet is completed, the combined
space station modules will be 63 feet long and carry an array of
solar panels 78 feet across. Then, astronauts Jerry Ross and James
Newman will make three 6-hour spacewalks in the following days to
finish connecting and testing the combined pieces _ the ``first
element'' of the International Space Station.
</P>
<P>
   It will take 45 flights by the US space shuttle and Russian
rockets to put together all 100 components of the station. But in
just over a year, in January 2000, it will be able to support a
crew of astronauts. Three astronauts will be sent up that month on
a Russian Soyuz module to begin a five-month stay in the station.
They will return by shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   The whole assembly process will involve more spacewalks in orbit
than have been carried out so far by all US and Russian astronauts
since the dawn of the human space program.
</P>
<P>
   ``This flight will clearly demonstrate the unique capabilities
of the space shuttle and of astronauts and cosmonauts to assemble
large structures in space,'' said George Abbey, director of the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Johnson Space
Center.
</P>
<P>
   And with 16 nations involved in building and operating parts of
the space station _ including all 11 members of the European Space
Agency, as well as Russia, Japan, and Canada _ this will be by far
the largest international collaboration ever attempted in space. It
will be a very different era after decades of intense international
competition.
</P>
<P>
   As NASA administrator Daniel Goldin put it, the station will
usher in ``a multinational permanent human presence in space. In
doing so, we will truly open up the space frontier, replete with
its tremendous challenge for the human spirit and its promise of
intellectual and material riches. The ISS will be a world community
living and working together in space.''

GORE ATTACKS GOV. BUSH OVER CONSERVATIVE STANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore moved closer to presidential
campaign mode Wednesday with a centrist call for ``practical
idealism'' and a pre-emptive attack on the man who might be his
Republican rival, Texas Governor George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Without mentioning Bush by name, Gore, addressing members of the
Democratic Leadership Council, ridiculed the Texan's recent
declaration that he can adhere to a ``conservative philosophy and
implement policies that are compassionate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some now say that we need a `compassionate conservatism.' I
wonder where they got that from?'' Gore said in a mocking tone.
``Let us be clear. We welcome all who truly want to join us in this
vital center. But there is a difference between using the rhetoric
of the center, and actually governing from the center.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said the governor was surprised at
Gore's remarks. ``He said what? Where?'' Bush said, according to
Hughes. She called Gore's statement ``rather odd.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It must indicate that the vice president is nervous or is at
least thinking a lot about an election that is two years away,''
Hughes said in a phone interview. ``It is unusual for the vice
president to clearly engage in an attack against a very popular
governor of Texas who has not even decided whether he will make a
national race.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's speech before the Council, a moderate force within the
party, was described by aides as an effort to underscore that he is
in the political mainstream as he prepares to run for president in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he attempted to portray his possible chief
rival as only a pretender to moderation. It was an effort that
echoed the way then-Governor Bill Clinton, with Gore as his running
mate, ran against Bush's father, President George Bush, in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's event before the leadership council, which had the
earmarks of a cattle call for possible Democratic presidential
candidates, underscored that the party's hopes for retaining
control of the White House may be in the hands of the moderates.
Three other Democratic prospects who appeared Wednesday _ Senator
John F. Kerry, Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and House Minority
Leader Richard Gephardt _ tailored their speeches to the center.
Kerry reiterated his call for education reform, Kerrey proposed
revamping Social Security, and Gephardt declared that Democrats
represent ``practicality and pragmatism.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's history with the DLC goes back a dozen years, and his
status as front-runner made him the star attraction, even though he
was vague about how he would implement ``practical idealism.''
</P>
<P>
   In a speech filled with empathy for suburban angst and
references to pop culture, Gore bemoaned a ``Beavis and Butthead
world'' where children are assaulted over the airwaves with
violence. He also cited the plight of two-income families with
little time for their children, and mourned an American landscape
blighted by sprawl and shopping malls. Gore did not, however, offer
any new initiatives to solve such problems.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's attack on Bush included a mocking comparison of a
compassionate conservative to a character from a ``Saturday Night
Live'' skit named Theodoric of York. ``After indulging in the most
grotesque and primitive practices in medicine or law, applying
leeches to heal the sick, or dunking witches in vats of oil,
Theodoric would pause for a sudden blinding insight, and question
whether we need a new, enlightened approach ... and after musing
poetically about the possibilities of the future, he'd admit,
Naaah!''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who helped create the Democratic Leadership Council a
dozen years ago and won election with President Clinton by running
on its centrist philosophy, Wednesday sought to redefine the DLC's
vision of a ``third way'' in politics.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president defined his practical idealism slogan with
the following statement: ``By strengthening the bond between
progressive goals and responsible government, by leading boldly
from this new and dynamic center, we can strengthen the bonds
between us all, and we can affirm our proudest potential: jobs and
opportunity, safe streets and strong communities, and a clean
environment; equal opportunity and fundamental fairness, global
strength and security.''

FROM MARK McGWIRE TO MARC CHAGALL, THE YEAR'S BEST COFFEE-TABLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: all quite exciting &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JEFF GUINN'S TOP TEN (listed alphabetically by title)
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrating 70: Mark McGwire's Historic Season'' by Bernie
Miklasz, Ron Smith, Mike Eisenbath and Dave Kindred (Sporting News,
$29.95). If anyone wonders whether baseball is back, just count the
oversized books on the sport that cram stores shelves this holiday
season. The best is this team effort by staffers at The Sporting
News, which captures the excitement of the 1998 season and a sense
of the player who dominated the diamond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Country Life: A Handbook for Realists and Dreamers,'' by Paul
Heiney (DK Publishing, $24.95). Believe it or not, here is a
coffee-table book that teaches readers how to milk cows and shear
sheep. Even if you have no plans to go out and live off the land,
you'll have lots of fun learning how to build a proper manure pile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Icons of the 20th Century: 200 Men and Women Who Have Made a
Difference,'' by Barbara Cady (Overlook, $75). This is a truly
stunning collection of essays about the great leaders, thinkers and
performers of modern times. Photo editor Jean-Jacques Naudet
provides equally impressive art.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leading the West: One Hundred Contemporary Painters and
Sculptors,'' by Donald J. Hagerty (Northland, $60). The American
West has been described as ``the landscape of the American
psyche.'' It is impossible not to be drawn to at least some of the
art and sculpture reproduced here, and Hagerty's accompanying notes
are highly informative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music From the Heart: The Fifty-Year Chronicle of His Life in
Music,'' by Rod Kennedy (Eakin Press, $39.95). Although he is
best-known as producer of the legendary Kerrville Folk Festival,
Rod Kennedy's career mirrors the history of Texas music since the
1960s. This is fun to read and a primer on the music industry, and
it represents a significant achievement on the part of Austin-based
Eakin Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Prince of Egypt: A New Vision in Animation,'' by Charles
Solomon (Abrams, $45). Film animation has come a long way since the
primitive contortions of ``Steamboat Willie.'' DreamWorks SGK has
spared no expense creating ``The Prince of Egypt,'' its touted
holiday '98 release, and this eponymously titled book lets us in on
all the secrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rolling Stones: A Life on the Road,'' by Jools Holland and
Dora Loewenstein (Penguin Studio, $50). In a coffee-table book
publishing cycle when it is obviously ``in'' to chronicle rock
stars and bands (Phish, Springsteen, the Grateful Dead), this
insider's view of the Stones on the road proves to be the best.
There are lots of reasonably insightful interviews with Keith,
Mick, Charlie and Ronnie. Ex-bassist Bill Wyman gets a chance to
reminisce. Too bad Brian Jones can't add his tuppence worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Superman: The Complete History,'' by Les Daniels (Chronicle
Books, $29.95). Some oversized books are meant to be informative,
others to awe readers with sheer gorgeousness. A special few, like
this one, are meant to be both, plus fun to read. Daniels shares a
wealth of knowledge; devotees of the Man of Steel have to have this
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Testament: At the Creation of the State of Israel,'' by Aaron
Levin (Artisan, $35). The photographs are all in black and white,
but none is somber. Each depicts an older Israeli and complements
his or her recollections of the founding of Israel after World War
II. These first-person accounts are staggeringly honest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Warhol Look,'' edited by Mark Francis and Margery King
(Bullfinch Press, $75. Depending on your opinion, Andy Warhol was
either a modern-art pioneer or an overhyped hack. Either way, this
eclectic package of photos, essays, reproduced newspaper articles
and other assorted bits and pieces pretty well captures the man's
quirky work and interests. .MDBU/.MDNM/ (Visit the Star-Telegram's

From Mark McGwire to Marc Chagall, the year's best coffee-table
books 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL AND JEFF GUINN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From ``Dressing Diana'' to ``Ultimate Beer,'' from ``Texas Sky''
to ``Tuscany Interiors,'' the season yields coffee-table books
about everything but the kitchen sink. Of course, maybe that will
come next year.
</P>
<P>
   In midyear they trickled in, and with autumn they became a
landslide: a few hundred gift books to bewilder us once more. No
way to cover them all, so Star-Telegram book editors have
endeavored to identify their favorites from the lavish inventory.
</P>
<P>
   LARRY SWINDELL'S TOP TEN
</P>
<P>
   ``The American Heritage History of the United States,'' by
Douglas Brinkley (Viking, $50). This is not a textbook; instead, it
is what textbooks eternally should be. It's a spirited narrative
account of the birth, life and ascent of our nation. The work is
not overpowered by the visual quotient, although paintings,
drawings and photographs are abundant, and all well-chosen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chagall,'' by Jacob Baal-Teshuva (Taschen, $50). The season
offers fancy-volume salutes to individual artists famous and less
so. This sumptuous tribute to Marc Chagall eclipses the field for
three primary reasons: the stature of the artist; the value of the
substantial critical text; and the fidelity of color reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eye of the Beholder: The Photography of James L. Stanfield,''
(National Geographic, $40). Here the color photography is
captivating not in a spectacular way, but for the human drama it
consistently defines. Stanfield's camera has been all over the
world. Extended captions and random text inserts decode the skill
and imagination of Stanfield's 30-year picture-taking odyssey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Illustrated Longitude,'' by Dava Sobel and William J.H.
Andrews (Walker, $32.95). Sobel's ``Longitude'' was critically
acclaimed three years ago. This republication in oversized format
is richly illustrated under Andrews' supervision. It's for science
buffs, being the ``true story of a lone genius (John Harrison) who
solved the greatest scientific problem of his time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One Digital Day: How the Microchip Is Changing Our World,''
created by Rick Smolan and Jennifer Erwitt, and designed by Tom
Walker (Times Books/Random House, $40). From the creators of the
popular ``Day in the Life'' series of books in coffee-table format,
here's an exploration of the microchip's omnipresence. ``In one
generation, microchips have changed the world so profoundly that
daily life without them has become unimaginable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Painted Sketch: American Impressions From Nature,
1830-1880,'' by Eleanor Jones Harvey (Dallas Museum of Art/Abrams,
$49.50). Some art books are merely to look at. This one's
educational, a fascinating crash course in the tradition of
American landscape painting. The pioneering heroes of this serene
volume are Thomas Cole, Albert Bierstadt, Frederic Church and
Sanford Robinson Gifford.
</P>
<P>
   The Simon &AMP; Schuster Encyclopedia of Animals, Dr. Philip
Whitfield, general consultant ($50). It's what it says it is: ``A
visual who's who of the world's creatures.'' It may not be as much
fun as a trip to the zoo, but it's more informative, and here
you'll find more animals than any zoo could accommodate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sports Art of Bart Forbes,'' (Beckett, $39.95). The
enterprising, Dallas-based specialist in commemorative sports books
has outdone itself with this assembly of oils and watercolors by
one of the sports world's premier artists. Forbes doesn't miss,
whether it's baseball, football, basketball, boxing, tennis, auto
racing, or outdoor sports; but the impression given here is that
golf is the activity closest to the artist's heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Story of Opera,'' by Richard Somerset-Ward (Abrams,
$49.50). For anyone who cares about opera, this is the gift book of
the year. People who don't go for grand opera may change their tune
if they absorb this book, which is to be read. It's a vivid history
of the hybrid theatrical form that is opera, from the very
beginning to now. Sample chapter headings: ``From Gluck to
Mozart''; ``The Golden Age of Italian Opera''; ``German Romantic
Opera''; ``Popular Musical Theater''; and ``On the Twentieth
Century.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tributes: Celebrating 50 Years of New York City Ballet,''
conceived and edited by Christopher Ramsey (Morrow, $50). There's
enough to see and enough to read, although the preface by Peter
Martins and foreword by Mikhail Baryshnikov are superfluous. A
potpourri of essays on different aspects of the art adds up not to
a book about ballet, but a book about a ballet company, and it's
all quite exciting. MORE &QL;

JOHN HANCOCK SIGNS DEAL TO SELL ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. signed a $7.5
million deal Wednesday to market through websites on Microsoft's
MSN online service, joining a growing number of companies signing
big Internet advertising contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Microsoft will help construct interactive
banner advertisements that will appear for two years at sites
including MSNBC, MSN HomeAdvisor, MSN MoneyCentral and the online
magazine Slate.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is one of many hammered out this year by Internet
services like America Online and Microsoft, which has recently put
together agreements with financial institutions like First USA and
Unilever, the consumer products giant that makes everything from
Lipton tea to Calvin Klein perfumes, industry observers said. But
Hancock is the first insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one deal in many that is making a trend,'' said Jill
Frankle, an analyst at Framingham-based International Data Corp.
``This one is set apart because it's insurance. But what it's
telling us is that a much broader spectrum of companies are seeing
the Internet as a place to advertise.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads will have electronic links that hook up consumers with
Hancock's homepage and allow them to fill out applications and
purchase insurance on-line, said Kathy Graveline, a Hancock senior
vice president in charge of Internet sales.
</P>
<P>
   Internet insurance sales are expected to soar in coming years.
Dozens of companies now offer products online. And Forrester
Research in Cambridge says it expects sales over the Internet to
approach $155 million this year and to climb to $4 billion within
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock's Graveline said since the company developed its
homepage two years ago, on-line sale of life insurance has jumped
to almost 20 percent of the company's total life insurance sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``That surprised everyone,'' she said. ``We want to be the
player on the Internet. We want to be there when those sales
figures get big.''

HARVARD DIPS INTO ENDOWMENT, UPS FUNDING 20 PERCENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Harvard University, responding to an embarrassment of
riches in its investments and fund-raising, Wednesday announced
that it will tap its endowment for an extra $95 million beginning
next year to reduce class sizes, expand financial aid, hire more
professors, and make other educational improvements.
</P>
<P>
   The 20 percent increase will bring the endowment's payment into
Harvard's annual operating budget _ which currently stands at $1.7
billion _ to $500 million starting in fiscal 2000. Officials said
the contribution would subsequently grow by 4 percent to 5 percent
a year, and by more if investments continue to soar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very major move,'' Neil Rudenstine, Harvard's
president, said in a telephone interview last night. ``It's rare
that you have the chance to undergird so many parts of the
institution that need the help. . . . Historically, I don't
remember when it happened last, it's that unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's action has significant implications, both for its own
future and for other top-tier educational institutions.
</P>
<P>
   In an academic world in which national competition for students
and faculty is rapidly intensifying, the additional money
presumably will help Harvard maintain or even expand its prestige
and appeal. At the same time, Harvard's decision to dip more deeply
into its endowment seems certain to induce other schools to follow
suit _ especially since they also have enjoyed investment returns
hovering around 20 percent during the stock market boom of the last
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, including some major donors, have urged many American
colleges and universities to channel more of their windfalls to
offset tuition increases and other rising costs. Harvard has
received the most attention, however, because its endowment of
nearly $13 billion far exceeds that of any other institution of
higher education in the world.
</P>
<P>
   A Boston Globe series earlier this year raised questions about
whether Harvard was growing more concerned about accumulating funds
than spending them. It reported that the university, while reaping
huge returns on its investments and exceeding goals in a $2.1
billion fund-raising campaign, spent less than 4 percent of its
endowment for educational purposes at a time when tuition costs
were rising, junior faculties salaries were lagging, and many
students sought more financial aid.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard officials acknowledged Wednesday that they were aware of
the criticism surrounding their endowment, and had been prodded by
some contributors, as they considered whether to move more money
into the operating budget. But they insisted they had not acted in
response to any pressure; rather, they said they had waited until
they felt certain about the stability of their financial gains,
then started discussions last summer on how large a shift to
execute.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was clearly an awareness . . . that people perceive us
as being extremely fortunate,'' said Elizabeth C. Huidekoper, the
university's vice president for finance. ``We already knew we were
fortunate, though, and we felt an obligation to use our good
fortune wisely to invest in high-priority progams.''
</P>
<P>
   While they would not acknowledge it for the record, the Harvard
officials clearly knew months ago that some big infusion of funds
would be forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   In September, they announced the most sweeping restructuring of
the school's undergraduate financial-aid program in three decades.
The 20 percent overall boost in assistance included an additional
$2,000 per student annually beginning this year, along with an
easing of work requirements.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, no one discussed exactly where the money would come
from to pay for the ambitious program, which Harvard touted as an
attempt to ease the burden of its $31,132 yearly pricetag.
Wednesday, though, the source of the funding became clear: the
extra endowment contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Several administrators said specific decisions had not yet been
made on where else the $95 million will go, but they agreed that
much of the money will be channeled to areas that don't tend to
receive targeted donations. They said, for example, that graduate
and professional-school students are likely to get more financial
aid and that attempts will be made to hold down tuition rises _
which have been criticized in recent years because they exceeded
the rate of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Rudenstine said a significant chunk of the money will be used
for capital investment, particularly in the sciences and new
technologies. Those fields increasingly require larger expenditures
for buying and updating equipment, since the state of the art
advances so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to stay strong in science, you know now that you
have to spend the money,'' said Rudenstine. ``It's very
competitive; it's just a fact of life. . . . You simply need the
systems that allow people to do the kind of work they expect to do
at a place like Harvard.''
</P>
<P>
   Other officials, noting this same competitive climate, said the
university plans to recruit new faculty in several areas with its
additional funding, including some to expand its offerings in the
sciences and new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The breadth of Harvard's plans for the endowment money
illustrates just how ambitious it plans to be _ and how much money
is involved. The university also intends to help pay for extensive
new computer systems for research and teaching; for the
preservation of voluminous library materials; for promoting more
cross-disciplinary study; and for cutting the size of some classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an extraordinarily welcome step that will allow some
very significant improvements in education,'' said Jeremy Knowles,
the dean of the faculty of arts and sciences. He estimated that his
school's annual budget of $550 million would now grow by $20
million to $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   His smile almost audible over the telephone, Knowles added:
``You are talking to a very happy dean.''

ORDERING CLINTON AND DOLE TO REPAY MILLIONS UNLIKELY, EXPERTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Election Commission is widely expected
to reject its staff auditors' recommendation that the 1996
campaigns of President Clinton and former Sen. Bob Dole repay the
government millions of dollars because of violations of campaign
finance rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a virtual certainty that these things won't be adopted,''
said David Mason, a Republican in his first year as a commissioner.
Mason said in an interview Wednesday that when the six-member
commission meets Thursday he would offer motions that would have
the effect of blocking most, if not all, of the repayment
requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Cooper, a former senior staff member of the commission and
now a consultant on campaign finance matters, agreed with Mason's
assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they go along with the staff recommendation, that would be
a shocker,'' Cooper said. ``I think they'll block it on a 6-0
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   The main reason for the confident predictions that the
commission will overrule its auditors is that the six members _ by
law, three Republicans and three Democrats _ are generally beholden
to their parties, and both parties are vigorously opposing the
stiff penalties that were recommended.
</P>
<P>
   The auditors' report, released on Tuesday, found that the
Clinton and Dole presidential campaigns illegally benefited from
issue advertising paid for by their political parties. The staff
recommended that the Clinton campaign committee be forced to repay
the government $7 million and the Dole campaign $17.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   The assessments would partly offset the $13 million each
candidate received in federal matching money in the primary season
in 1996 and the more than $60 million each received for the general
election campaign. In return for the federal money, the candidates
agreed to limit their spending of private funds.
</P>
<P>
   The commission may vote on the audit on Thursday, or a vote may
be put off until next week, officials said. It would take a
majority of four of the commissioners to adopt the report.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Attorney General Janet Reno subpoenaed an early
draft of the audit, and it became the basis for a preliminary
inquiry into whether she should ask for an independent counsel to
investigate accusations of unlawful spending by Clinton and the
Democratic Party. She is expected to announce her decision by Dec.
7.
</P>
<P>
   The word among law enforcement officials has been that she is
likely to find insufficient grounds to warrant an outside counsel.
No one knows whether the final audit or its rejection by the
commission will affect her decision.
</P>
<P>
   But Reno was put in an awkward position by the finding that the
Dole campaign had committed some of the same violations that
Republican lawmakers have accused Clinton of. Under the independent
counsel law, she is required to ask for an outside prosecutor if
she finds clear evidence of criminal wrongdoing by the president.
But she cannot seek an independent counsel to investigate Dole and
the Republicans because they are not among those covered by the
law.
</P>
<P>
   If the auditors' recommendations are rejected, it will
illustrate two important points: The campaign law is so riddled
with loopholes that almost any restraint can be breached, and the
FEC is basically toothless.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the millions of dollars the parties spent on issue
advertisements on behalf of their presidential candidates. The
auditors found that the issue ads, as anyone who saw them on
television recognized, were hardly distinguishable from the
candidates' own commercials, spending on which was carefully
limited by law.
</P>
<P>
   Mason, who was an assistant to Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., and a
scholar at the Heritage Foundation before he was appointed to the
FEC, has spoken and written in opposition to limits on ``soft
money,'' the unregulated money used by political parties.
</P>
<P>
   But in this case, he said, that view is irrelevant. He holds
that there is no basis in the law for requiring repayments of
matching funds that candidates received during the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   And those who predict that the FEC will overrule their auditors'
recommendations point out that the terms of two commissioners _ Lee
Ann Elliott, a Republican, and Danny McDonald, a Democrat _ expire
in April, and presumably they want their parties to reappoint them.
Three others _ Mason; Darryl Wold, also a Republican, and Karl
Sandstrom, a Democrat _ were recently appointed to the commission,
presumably because of their loyalty to their parties. The sixth
member is the acting chairman, Scott Thomas, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can bet that they've been getting a lot of calls on
this,'' said Cooper, the former FEC staff member.

FROM TV'S ARCHIVES, 15 THAT GOT AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some of TV's best shows ever died young and left handsome
corpses.
</P>
<P>
   They make up our list of all-time top flops _ shows that were
canceled too soon but buried with full creative honors.
</P>
<P>
   Better that than to live in infamy, in the scruffy company of
two-time Nielsen ratings champ ``The Beverly Hillbillies.''
</P>
<P>
   Television's all-time favorite failure is none other than ``Star
Trek,'' which broke free from the grave and mother-shipped a
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   True, ``Star Trek'' wasn't axed after a month, or even a season.
But it was hard-pressed to last from 1966 into the 1968-69 season,
leaving behind those eternal 79 episodes.
</P>
<P>
   To the NBC brass, ``Star Trek'' was a fanciful clunker with a
small but rabid fan base. If it had had the stuff of a true hit, it
would have knocked CBS' ``Gomer Pyle'' out of the box. It didn't,
and it died, only to fulfill its phenomenal Lazarus destiny in the
world of syndicated reruns.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us can recall an attachment to some prematurely canceled
series. ``My So-Called Life,'' maybe. ``The Days and Nights of
Molly Dodd.'' Or last season's ``Nothing Sacred.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is one critic's list of 14 other shows that were canceled
in their youth _ usually the first season _ but deserved longer
runs.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``The Ernie Kovacs Show,'' &LR;  CBS, 1952-53. Kovacs could always
get noticed, but he never had a national hit. And yet he was the
inventive comedian who broke from the radio-with-pictures mold and
used the techniques of television itself _ including video tricks
and blackouts _ to get laughs. Among the regular features were the
ape-suited Nairobi Trio, the lisping poet Percy Dovetonsils, singer
(and Kovacs' wife) Edie Adams and all manner of people emerging
from a single bathtub.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``East Side, West Side,'' &LR;  CBS, 1963-64. Starring George C.
Scott as New York social worker Neil Brock, it lasted one gritty
and ratings-impaired season. It was a period of high idealism and
grand social shifts in American life, but TV viewers apparently
weren't ready to see urban social problems, including race
relations, dramatized in a weekly series.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``The Paper Chase,'' &LR;  CBS, 1978-79. Based on the novel and
1973 movie, the series starred James Stephens as a first-year
student at a prestigious Eastern law school and John Houseman as
the legendary law professor who was especially adept at terrorizing
first-year students. The drama was a favorite of CBS chairman
William Paley. And (set ital)still(end ital) it was canceled for
anemic ratings. But like ``Star Trek,'' it found a new lease
elsewhere. Showtime cable picked up the series for what would
become 36 new episodes. It was the first such network-to-cable
transfer.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``The Associates,'' &LR;  ABC, 1979-80. Way too slick for the ABC
of 1979. ``Laverne &AMP; Shirley'' and ``Happy Days,'' sure, but this
was a smart, attractively produced comedy about lawyers. The main
characters were three youthful associates at a Wall Street legal
firm headed by the ever-so-slightly senile Emerson Marshall
(Wilfrid Hyde-White). One of the associates, Tucker Kerwin, was
played by a relatively unknown Canadian comic, Martin Short. The
show was mainly a victim of scheduling. It was slotted after ``Mork
&AMP; Mindy'' on Sunday nights, when ABC foolishly decided that Robin
Williams could finish off Archie Bunker.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``United States,'' &LR;  NBC, 1980. First telecast, March 11.
Final telecast, April 29. That's grim. But this comedy from Larry
Gelbart was a ground-breaker anyway. Starring Beau Bridges and
Helen Shaver, it downplayed jokes and tried to mix comedy and drama
in the course of examining the tribulations of a modern marriage.
Viewers apparently found it grim and preachy. And, in truth, it
doesn't stand up well to time. But for 1980, it was daring adult
television.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Bosom Buddies,'' &LR;  ABC, 1980-1982. It hung around for a
season and a half, but it was touch-and-go all the way. The idea
was that two desperate male roommates had to masquerade as women to
live in a New York residential hotel for women. ``Bosom Buddies''
relied too heavily on cheap laughs and short towels for the boys'
new gal pals. But the stars had talent and chemistry. One was Peter
Scolari, pre-``Newhart.'' The other was Tom Hanks, pre-everything.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Bay City Blues,'' &LR;  NBC, 1983. That's October 1983 and
November 1983. Co-created by Steven Bochco, it was a one-hour drama
about life with a minor-league baseball team, the Bay City (Calif.)
Bluebirds. Guess what; there's never been a hit TV series about
baseball. And this show had an amazing distinction; every single
quarter hour it was on the air, its ratings declined from the
previous quarter hour. That's failure, and yet ``Bay City Blues''
was a good, textured show. The cast included Michael Nouri, Pat
Corley, Bernie Casey, Dennis Franz, Michele Greene, Ken Olin, Peter
Jurasik, Sheree North and, as the wife of the bed-wetting star
pitcher, Sharon Stone.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``The `Slap' Maxwell Story,'' &LR;  ABC, 1987-88. It was somewhere
in the middle of Dabney Coleman's string of TV flops, after the
better-remembered ``Buffalo Bill.'' The show was also a dramedy, a
drama-comedy hybrid that's never quite sprouted in Nielsen soil.
Coleman adroitly balanced the laughs and pathos as an acerbic
sports columnist for a little newspaper in New Mexico. Splendidly
written and acted, the show failed to survive for a full season.
Among the other cast members were Megan Gallagher as Slap's
girlfriend, Susan Anspach as his ex-wife and Bill Cobbs as a bar
proprietor.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``A Year in the Life,'' &LR;  NBC, 1987-88. NBC's programming
chief, the late Brandon Tartikoff, swore that this cancellation
really hurt. It should have hurt. Spawned by a 1986 miniseries, the
intelligent and realistic drama series was about a Seattle widower
and businessman (Richard Kiley) and his four grown children.
Viewers seemed to mistake it for educational television. So
producers Joshua Brand and John Falsey, fresh from ``St.
Elsewhere,'' were forced to pack and move on to their next big
project, ``Northern Exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Twin Peaks,'' &LR;  ABC, 1990-91. It's an anomaly among these
vaunted failures. Everything else was killed off. ``Twin Peaks''
amounted to a suicide. The David Lynch-Mark Frost series premiered
to critical raves, a ready-made reputation for hipness and decent
ratings. Then, over the next year, the producers ran it into the
ground. The show bogged down in confusion, tangents and surrealism
when it should have advanced the continuing story line of Laura
Palmer's murder. But when it was good, ``Twin Peaks'' could elicit
a giggle, a shudder and a ``huh?'' almost simultaneously. Certainly
coffee and cherry pie will never be the same again. Such a
squandered opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Middle Ages,'' &LR;  CBS, 1992. Would Baby Boomers watch a TV
series that reminded them they were getting older? Absolutely not;
``Middle Ages'' lasted less than a month. And the show had so much
to say, most of it revolving around the humdrum life of a
43-year-old traveling salesman (Peter Riegert) in the throes of a
midlife crisis. Sexual dysfunction, insecurities, career stall,
corporate downsizing _ it was all here. Nice cast, too. Besides
Riegert, there were William Russ, Michael O'Keefe, James Gammon,
Amy Brenneman, Kyle Secor and Maria Pitillo.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Profit,'' &LR;  Fox, 1996. Adrian Pasdar was Jack Profit, the
company's junior vice president for acquisitions. He was also a
psychopath who'd been raised in a cardboard moving box, where he
could watch TV through a peephole. This sardonic series simply
teemed with nasty metaphors for our times. It was probably on the
wrong network. Or maybe Rupert Murdoch saw something of himself
here and got spooked. Too bad.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``EZ Streets,'' &LR;  CBS, 1996-97. Producer Paul Haggis created
his own pea-soup world of public and private corruption in the
decaying heart of a Rust Belt city. So OK, it wasn't exactly
designed to be a huge hit. But the drama, which starred Ken Olin,
certainly deserved better than it got. Joe Pantoliano was wonderful
as a mob boss on the make. In one pilot scene, he made small talk
while he and a dim-witted underling (Mike Starr) rummaged through
severed hands in a freezer, looking for just the right fingerprint
to attach to a murder weapon.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Lateline,'' &LR;  NBC, 1998. It's not dead yet. But it's not on
the air, either, and worrying is encouraged. In his comedy send-up
of a ``Nightline''-like news show, Al Franken was Al Freundlich,
schlemiel and overly sincere network news correspondent. In its few
weeks on the air to date, ``Lateline'' already contributed a
classic half hour in which the labor story Freundlich has nursed to
air is pre-empted in favor of a premature obituary for Buddy
Hackett.

WORLD BANK REPORT LAYS BLAME IN GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISES

 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The decision by the International Monetary Fund and
the United States Treasury last year to push Asian nations to send
their interest rates soaring was a crucial blunder that worsened
the world financial crisis, the World Bank concluded Wednesday in a
report of how the trouble started.
</P>
<P>
   The 200-page document deliberately omitted any direct reference
to the IMF or to the Treasury, which has a major voice in the IMF's
decisions. The omission, bank officials said, was a conciliatory
gesture to both institutions, which have often disagreed with the
bank on strategies to fix the crisis that began 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank's blow-by-blow account of a series of cascading
misjudgments places much of the blame on global investors who lent
money with abandon to developing nations, and on Asian officials
who were eager to accumulate the cash. But it left little doubt
that in the bank's judgment the IMF and the Clinton administration
shared responsibility for mishandling the initial response to the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The report also predicts that most of the afflicted nations will
probably begin climbing out of recession next year, with growth
continuing in 2000. But it warns that ``there is still a
substantial risk that the world economy will plunge into recession
in 1999,'' particularly if Japan is unable to end its recession.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank report reflects a broader debate among economists
and policymakers about whether decisions by the IMF and the U.S.
Treasury deepened the crisis, and whether the movement in recent
years to liberalize financial markets around the world should be
dramatically slowed. It argues that some system should be developed
to limit the rush of short-term investments into developing
countries that do not yet have the regulatory systems in place to
monitor how the foreign cash is spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heart of this current crisis,'' Joseph Stiglitz, the chief
economist of the Bank, said Wednesday, ``is the surge of capital
flows _ the surge is followed by a precipitous flow out. Few
countries, no matter how strong their financial institutions, could
have withstood such a turnaround, but clearly, the fact that the
financial institutions were weak and their firms highly leveraged
made these countries particularly vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the IMF nor the Treasury, both of which saw the report
before it was published, issued any public comment on it Wednesday.
There are parts they agree with: IMF and Treasury officials have
often blamed the huge volume of private investment into developing
countries _ and the refusal of investors to heed the risks
associated with putting their money into countries with few
regulatory safeguards _ for creating the conditions that led to the
bust.
</P>
<P>
   But they continue to defend their initial strategy of urging
Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea to raise their interest rates,
a classic economic solution intended to reassure investors and
stabilize national currencies. In Thailand and South Korea, those
rates have now declined to about 7 percent and the currencies have
stabilized, developments that IMF officials say vindicate their
approach.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank's report argues that the strategy backfired,
stabilizing the currencies at the cost of plunging the countries
into deep recessions with substantial unemployment. The report
asserts that the interest rate increases spread the economic pain
far beyond the banks, investment funds and real estate companies
that had gotten the countries into trouble to begin with, sending
thousands of small businesses in to bankruptcy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Some estimates are that levels of bankruptcy in Indonesia now
are 75 percent,'' Stiglitz argued Wednesday, ``and, you know, you
cannot have a country perform with 75 percent of its firms in
bankruptcy.''
</P>
<P>
   The report was published on the day that the board of the IMF
formally began its review of the latest bailout, a $41.5 billion
aid package to Brazil. While the World Bank is a major participant
in that bailout, it warned Wednesday against the risk of what it
termed ``rescue creep'' as aid packages get larger and larger.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``No reasonable amount of public money can stop a justified
speculative attack'' on a country's currency, the report concluded.
``By themselves, larger packages worsen moral hazard problems'' _
the risk that investors will expect governments to bail them out _
``and may lead to excessively tough conditions, defeating the end
objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank and the IMF were both created by the Bretton
Woods agreement in 1944 to bring order to the world economy. The
bank's primary responsibility is tending to the poor with
development programs to help fend off poverty and disease; the IMF
focuses chiefly on economic and monetary policy. Those differing
mandates have often led them to disagreements, and two months ago
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin publicly warned both institutions
that the time had come to put their differences aside. One of the
many proposals floating around Washington to reform the
institutions would merge their governing boards, but that would
require a marriage of two very different cultures.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF continues to insist that it made the best judgments it
could at a time of tremendous chaos last year, when the governments
of Thailand and South Korea were going through elections and seemed
unable to make decisions. And it argues that its program in
Indonesia was undermined by the refusal of the government of
President Suharto to stick to its economic agreements, and then by
the political chaos that resulted in Suharto's resignation and
continues on the streets to this day.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at a seminar early this week a senior IMF official
conceded that the fund made some judgments ``too quickly'' and
mistakenly thought it was seeing a repeat of past currency crises,
particularly the one that struck Mexico in 1995. Several months
ago, Stanley Fischer, the IMF's first deputy managing director,
noted that ``in most cases governments call us in only after they
discover they are in a mess, usually because they didn't do things
they needed to do long ago. If the problems were easy to solve,
they'd do it themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the conclusions in the report are likely to fuel the
debate over what to do next. For example, the Bank calls for a
tremendous slowdown in the movement in recent years to deregulate
financial markets in developing countries, a reversal of the policy
that the IMF advocated as late as April 1997, just three months
before Thailand's troubles touched off the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Financial sector liberalization,'' the report concludes,
``which can significantly boost the risk of crisis, should proceed
with care and in step with the capacity to design and enforce
tighter regulation and supervision.'' In the past year the IMF and
the Treasury have begun to take the same line, stressing the need
to build regulatory institutions before opening economies to huge
capital flows.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank, however, praised the IMF's programs in several
countries, including their focus on restructuring corporations and
compelling countries, in return for aid, to overhaul their
bankruptcy systems and inject public funds into weak banking
systems.
</P>
<P>
   It also credited the IMF for loosening the conditions on the
bailout programs to ease the pain on the poor. Still it noted that
17 million more people in Indonesia are expected to fall below the
poverty line this year, as wages collapse.

ISRAEL CHALLENGES ARAFAT ON INDEPENDENT STATE CLAIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The Israeli government said Wednesday that it would
cede no more West Bank land until Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
reversed his often stated intention to declare the creation of an
independent Palestinian state next May.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimatum by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu casts an
ominous cloud over the rekindled peace process and the pending
visit by President Clinton on Dec. 14 to Gaza, seat of Arafat's
Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   The United States reacted quickly Wednesday, rejecting the new
conditions. Officials in Washington said envoy Dennis Ross would
head to the region this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not believe it is appropriate to add new conditions to
the implementation of this agreement,'' State Department spokesman
James Rubin said, according to Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   This latest war of words climaxed a long day of violence and
bloodshed that left an Israeli soldier injured and a Palestinian
civilian dead.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis, under a new interim peace agreement hammered out
in October at the Wye River Plantation in Maryland, are to withdraw
from an additional 5 percent of the West Bank in mid-December and
turn the land over to Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   Israel agreed in the accord to hand over another 13 percent of
the West Bank in three stages. It has already carried out the first
stage.
</P>
<P>
   This next step forward in the peace process was to coincide with
Clinton's visit, which a White House spokesman vowed Wednesday will
take place as planned despite the new tension created by the
Israeli demand.
</P>
<P>
   The statement from the Netanyahu government said, ``Israel will
carry out the next stage of the withdrawal only if . . . the
Palestinian Authority explicitly announces the abandonment of its
intention to unilaterally declare a Palestinian state.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement listed two other conditions: Palestinian agreement
to Israel's terms for the release of Palestinian political
prisoners from Israeli jails, and punitive measures against
Palestinians who took part in Wednesday's violence.
</P>
<P>
   The new Israeli ultimatum set the two sides on a collision
course in which Arafat would have to abandon a deeply emotional
promise to his people to declare the creation of an independent
state on May 4, 1999, or face the possibility of a new deadlock in
the much-delayed peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, both sides charged that the other had violated the
Wye Memorandum.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Palestinian peace negotiator Saeb Erekat called the
ultimatum a ``grave threat to the process'' and a ``complete
violation of the Wye agreement signed at the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They did not carry out the release of political prisoners.
They have continued expansion of settlements. And now they have set
a new condition,'' Erekat added. ``Why should we believe that they
are honoring this agreement? This is a total violation.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu senior advisor David Bar-Illan responded by asking,
``What are we giving them land for if they are going to scuttle the
process by unilaterally declaring a state?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palestinians have violated the Wye agreement by inciting
the violence we saw this afternoon and the constant pronoucnements
that they would declare an independent state,'' Bar-Illan added.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis last night watched chilling television images of a
group of Palestinian student demonstrators surrounding an Israeli
car in the West Bank town of Ramallah and brutally beating an
Israeli civilian and a soldier in the car.
</P>
<P>
   With TV cameras running, the Palestinians dragged the soldier
out of the car, pummelled him with rocks and stole his weapon
before he fled for his life toward an Israeli checkpoint. The
student protesters had gathered to demand that Israel live up to an
agreement to release Palestinian political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   But the morning began with Palestinian blood being shed.
</P>
<P>
   A 41-year-old Palestinian father of six was stabbed to death by
what police believe was an Israeli ``ultra-nationalist'' intent on
avenging the killings of Jews by Palestinians in Jerusalem.
Jerusalem Police commander Yair Yitzhaki said detectives were
investigating to determine if the murder was linked to the
stabbings late last year of six other Palestinians, one of which
was fatal, in Mea Sharim, the heart of the Jewish ultra-Orthodox
community in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral of the man, Osama Natshe, took place Wednesday in
the usually peaceful Arab-Jewish Jerusalem neighborhood of Abu Tor
where he lived and died. It touched off more violence as
Palestinian youths threw rocks and clashed with Israeli troops in
nearby East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Israel did carry out the release of some 150 Palestinian
prisoners last month, but Palestinian leaders say half of them were
common criminals and not the political prisoners they had expected
to be released.
</P>
<P>
   An angry Bar-Illan last night said the Israeli ultimatum was a
reaction to the beating of the Israeli soldier by the Palestinian
protesters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you see that? Did you watch those images? This is a mob
instigated by the Palestinian Authority.'' Palestinian Legislative
Council Chairman ``Abu Allah called on them to use `their stones,
their bodies' to attack settlers. What do you expect?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It (the ultimatum) is not just an emotional reaction to a near
lynching. It is the anger created when you know that this was
instigated and encouraged by the Palestinian government,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   David Makovsky, the diplomatic correspondent for the leading
Israeli newspaper, Ha'aretz, said, ``This is a dramatic
development. There have been fits and starts before. But this is
the first time the linkage is directly to a delcaration that Arafat
not declare a state on May 4.''
</P>
<P>
   Makovsky, who follows the peace process, said Arafat may have
brought this new crisis upon himself by repeatedly declaring his
intention to declare a state on May 4, a date which marks the end
of the five-year period set for Israelis and Palestinians to reach
a final agreement as outlined in the historic 1993 Oslo accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``These statements (by Arafat) were a miscalculation, and in a
way Arafat has played right into Netanyahu's hands. . . . It will
cast a shadow over the presidents visit if what was to be a
celebration of peace turns into a breakdown in the process,'' he
added.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A Palestinian mob beat an Israeli soldier and seized
his gun in the West Bank on Wednesday, prompting a warning from
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he might halt further
Israeli troop withdrawals in the West Bank under the new
land-for-security accord with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Violence also erupted in East Jerusalem after a Palestinian was
killed by an assailant believed to be a Jewish serial stabber
responsible for attacks on several Arabs in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   The incidents fueled the war of words between Israelis and
Palestinians that has been raging since they signed their latest
agreement, known as the Wye memorandum in Washington on Oct. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Consulting Cabinet ministers after the West Bank incident,
Netanyahu warned that there would be no further military
withdrawals unless the Palestinian Authority halted ``acts of
incitement and violence,'' abandoned plans to declare an
independent state in May and accepted Israeli criteria for the
release of Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Saeb Erakat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, dismissed the
Israeli demands as ``completely unacceptable.'' And Ahmad Tibi, an
adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, accused Netanyahu of
seeking pretexts to renege on the accord.
</P>
<P>
   (In Washington, the Clinton administration also rejected
Israel's new conditions and insisted that the Wye accord should be
carried out quickly.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Rubin said the United States
condemned the beating of an Israeli soldier. ``There is no place
for that kind of violence in the peace process,'' he said.
</P>

   U.S. officials said that despite the danger to the peace process
posed by a recent rash of violence, and the new Israeli ultimatum,
President Clinton still intended to visit the West Bank and Israel
later this month.)

   The beating of the soldier took place outside the
Palestinian-ruled town of Ramallah in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Students from Bir Zeit University who had marched for the
release of Palestinian prisoners stoned an Israeli car and smashed
its windows at a junction on the northern outskirts of the city.
After the driver fled, an Israeli soldier riding in the car was
beaten and his gun seized before the mob set the vehicle on fire.
The shaken soldier escaped with light injuries. Israeli troops who
rushed to the scene fired rubber-coated bullets and tear gas to
disperse the attackers.

<P>
   The commander of Israeli forces in the West Bank, Brig. Gen.
Yitzhak Eitan, accused the Palestinian police of failing to block
the marchers, and Israeli forces responded by preventing a convoy
of Palestinian police officers from leaving Ramallah. The soldier's
gun was later returned to the Israelis by the Palestinian
Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the Ramallah incident as ``the climax'' of
Palestinian violations of the latest peace accord, Netanyahu's
office released a statement laying down three conditions for a
further Israeli pullback.
</P>
<P>
   After consulting Cabinet ministers, the statement said,
Netanyahu decided that there will be a withdrawal only if the
Palestinian Authority accepted that prisoners released by Israel
under the Wye accord cannot ``have blood on their hands'' or be
members of Hamas; if it abandoned plans to declare an independent
state and declared itself ready to negotiate a permanent peace, and
if it halted incitement and violence while punishing the rioters
who attacked the car Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palestinian Authority is encouraging acts of violence such
as the brutal attack today in Ramallah, in an attempt to pressure
Israel on the issue of the prisoners,'' the statement quoted
Netanyahu as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians have demanded that Israel release prisoners
suspected of anti-Israeli violence and political activity, while
the Israelis have insisted on freeing mostly common criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing a rally of prisoners' families Tuesday, Ahmad Korei,
the speaker of the Palestinian parliament, declared, ``The
leadership that threw stones is ready to return and use stones to
free the people and the land.''
</P>
<P>
   The victim of the stabbing in Jerusalem was identified as Osama
Natsheh, a 41-year-old father of eight who worked as a city street
cleaner. A masked assailant stabbed him near his home in the mixed
Jewish-Arab neighborhood of Abu Tor, on the dividing line between
the Jewish and Arab areas of Jerusalem, the police and relatives
said.
</P>
<P>
   Natsheh's funeral set off fierce clashes in downtown East
Jerusalem, where scores of Palestinian youths threw stones at
Israeli police officers, who responded with heavy volleys of
rubber-coated bullets and tear gas. An Israeli pickup truck was set
on fire after its driver was forced out of the vehicle, and several
people were reportedly injured.
</P>
<P>
   The stabbing of Natsheh was the second fatal attack in a series
of seven knifings of Arabs in Jerusalem that began in December
1997, apparently in revenge for Palestinian slayings of Jews in the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Shmuel Ben-Ruby, a spokesman for the Jerusalem police, said that
investigators had recovered the knife used in Wednesday's attack
and that the evidence pointed to a possible connection to earlier
stabbings. A knife found after the fatal stabbing of an Arab last
May reportedly bore the name of a slain Jew.
</P>
<P>
   Natsheh's relatives said he had left for work shortly before 5
a.m. when he was stabbed about 30 yards from his home. Natsheh
staggered back toward the house, but collapsed on the sidewalk in a
pool of blood.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after the killing, a trail of blood marked Natsheh's
last steps on a street flanked by Jewish and Arab homes. Grieving
relatives sat silently as a mournful wail of Koran verses wafted
from a loudspeaker. A hand-made sign in Hebrew left by a Jewish
neighbor said: ``No to violence. Respect for every human life.''
Jewish residents of Abu Tor later issued a statement condemning the
killing, calling for coexistence and urging the police to catch the
attacker.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu also denounced the slaying. ``A murderer is a
murderer, and murder is murder,'' he told reporters. ``We are not
prepared to accept murder of innocents, and we demand pursuit of
all legal means against the murderers.''
</P>
<P>
   But Natsheh's neighbors said they felt unprotected by the
Israeli police, who have been unable to stop the serial stabbings
of Arabs in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we walk to work we're not safe,'' said Daoud Natsheh, the
victim's nephew. ``Only one side is secure. When a stone is thrown
in a Jewish neighborhood the police all arrive immediately. When
something happens here nobody reacts.''
</P>
<P>
   Faisal Husseini, the top Palestinian official in Jerusalem,
accused the Israeli authorities of dragging their feet in
investigating attacks on Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   Ben-Ruby asserted that police and the Shin Bet security service
were working intensively to track down the assailant. He said that
several suspects had been arrested after the previous stabbings,
which occurred in the area of the strictly Orthodox neighborhood of
Mea Shearim. The suspects were later released for lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that this is a lone stabber working by himself,
keeping his secret to himself, which makes it difficult to solve,''
Ben-Ruby said.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Even as global pressures drive Europe to a
tighter single market and a new single currency, similar pressures
are forcing a consolidation of the weapons and aviation industries.
</P>
<P>
   European leaders recognize that with the fall of Communism,
their military needs are radically different. And the emergence of
U.S. giants like Boeing, Raytheon and Lockheed Martin creates a new
competitive landscape. So these leaders envision the arms and
aircraft industries from each nation uniting in a single, highly
efficient, all-purpose conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   Progress toward this goal has been glacial, but it is still
creating tremendous strains, especially in France. Aerospatiale,
France's aerospace and arms group, is about to be transformed from
a state-owned company to a private one for the sole purpose of
qualifying to join this Continent-wide behemoth, but Yves Michot,
its chairman and chief executive, is not entirely happy with how
the process is unfolding.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want to merge together, we need to have each other's
full confidence,'' he said. But Michot has not found that comfort
level. Like many in France, he objected to the way foreign business
leaders, notably those at British Aerospace and DaimlerChrysler
Aerospace, a unit of the German industrial giant DaimlerChrysler,
had threatened to snub the French if they did not cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   And even if Europe pulls off the creation of the conglomerate,
tentatively known as the European Aerospace and Defense Co., some
experts, fearing a monopoly that would stifle competition, wonder
whether they should.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not like a world in which you have three large United
States integrated contractors _ Boeing, Raytheon and Lockheed _ and
one in Europe,'' said John Deutsch, a former U.S. Undersecretary of
Defense. A single European military contractor, he argued, would
``essentially not be competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from fighting off antitrust regulators, though, Europe's
military industries are actually getting encouragement from their
governments. Competition is assured, the companies argue, given the
huge American presence in the European arms and aviation market.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. companies have always done a booming military business in
Europe. During the Cold War, many European countries, particularly
smaller nations like the Netherlands and Belgium, almost
exclusively bought U.S. fighter aircraft and weapons systems.
European industry leaders, including the French, deny they want
anything like a Fortress Europe now.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. arms companies, of course, went through a similar, though
less extreme, consolidation. European executives like to talk about
the ``Last Supper,'' a 1993 gathering at which Les Aspin, then U.S.
defense secretary, sketched out for industry leaders the Pentagon's
view of the future, one in which a few military contractors would
divide a greatly curtailed Pentagon budget.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in Europe, the process has been reversed, with executives at
British Aerospace and DaimlerChrysler pushing their agenda on often
reluctant governments.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere has that reluctance been more evident than in France.
The prospect of marring the prestige of a French national industry,
not to mention losing jobs, is creating a fierce conflict that pits
French traditions against the harsh realities of a globalizing
world.
</P>
<P>
   But the process has most definitely begun. In November, Dassault
Aviation Group announced that it would transfer the government's
stake, 46 percent, to Aerospatiale. The plan involving Dassault, a
maker of Mirage and Rafale military jets and Falcon business jets,
was announced in July, but it took months to secure the approval of
Serge Dassault, the company's feisty 73-year-old chief executive
and controlling shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   This follows a decision in July by the government of Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin, after months of debate, to push the
government's stake in Aerospatiale below 50 percent and bring in
the big weapons and publishing group Lagardere as the leading
private shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   By this week, after separate consultation with the German and
British governments about recasting the military industry, Paris
appeared to have dropped its fundamental insistence on a
simultaneous three-way merger, clearing the path for a gradual
two-by-two process, including some form of union between British
Aerospace and DaimlerChrysler, to be followed by a link with
Aerospatiale and Lagardere's Matra military business.
</P>
<P>
   Aerospatiale has excellent products and advanced technology, but
past government largess produced a company rich in technology but
inefficient and unaccustomed to the notion of shareholder value.
``Ten years ago, the government told Aerospatiale not to make
profits but to make products,'' said Philippe Gossard, of Credit
Lyonnais Securities in Paris. And the numbers show that
productivity has indeed sagged. Last year, each of Aerospatiale's
37,000 employees generated $297,000 of revenues, against $326,000
for British Aerospace's 46,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   For France's partners at British Aerospace and DaimlerChrysler,
both owned by shareholders, getting government out of the business
is an essential first step.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our demand is that future shareholders be of the same sort and
share the same goals,'' said Wolfgang Piller, a strategy chief at
DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Richard Evans, chairman of British Aerospace, agrees. The
group should feature a highly fragmented shareholder base, he said
recently, adding that for the Germans and the British, there should
be zero government ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Industry leaders are also urging European governments to end
centuries of fragmentation and form common military and security
policies, including weapons procurement. ``Combine your purchasing
power,'' Piller said, ``and you will have all the influence
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Michot readily acknowledges that the changes at Aerospatiale
must go forward. ``It's not a problem of whether big is beautiful
or small is beautiful,'' he said in an interview, ``but projects
are more and more sophisticated, and bigger and bigger companies
are needed.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   What he acknowledges less readily is that Aerospatiale needs
reorganizing. It is, after all, no slouch. It has a 37.9 percent
stake in Airbus Industrie, the efficient, profitable consortium
that, despite bitter competition from Boeing, grabbed half the
worldwide orders this year for commercial jets. The Ariane rocket
program, a joint European undertaking in which Aerospatiale is
primary contractor, controls 50 percent of the market for satellite
launchings, a business expected to be worth $60 billion over the
next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some activities, like missiles, lose money, while others,
like a stake in ATR, a maker of turboprop aircraft, face an
uncertain future. And Ariane itself may prove to be a white
elephant, as smaller and cheaper satellite launching devices enter
the market.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts even question whether Michot, 57, an aeronautical
engineer with decades of experience as a government adviser on
weapons programs, is the man to do the reorganizing. Indeed, part
of the reason for bringing in Lagardere was to tap the group's
thick-skinned managers, like Philippe Camus, its 50-year-old chief
executive. The challenges facing the merger appear not to have
escaped Lagardere's investors, about 40 percent of whom are
American and British investment funds: After the July announcement,
the shares lost nearly half their value, though they have since
recovered much of that.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the French willingness to accept private solutions by
bringing in Lagardere and Dassault shows their flexibility. And
Michot says it can go further. Jospin's government, he said, which
originally insisted on a permanent government minority stake in
Aerospatiale, and hence in the new European arms company, is now
pragmatic. ``If I go back with a good idea, the consequence of
which is a new decrease in the government stake,'' he said, ``they
are ready to examine it.''
</P>
<P>
   Such French pragmatism, experts say, illustrates how even rigid
political positions are gradually yielding to the realities of
international competition.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, discussion of a common European security policy is
reviving, and the process is expected to be accelerated when the
euro, the European single-currency, begins in January. Finance
ministers from the 11 countries that will adopt the euro now meet
regularly to formulate common economic policies, and this month the
15 military ministers of the European Union began similar meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have common grounds for our prosperity,'' said Holger H.
Mey, director of the Institute for Strategic Analyses in Bonn,
``then shouldn't we have a common security policy?''
</P>
<P>
   But if that is the long-term goal, what drives the current
change is the onslaught of the U.S. giants _ Boeing, Raytheon and
Lockheed Martin. In 1987, the United States had 22 percent of the
$85 billion world arms market; by this year, the market had shrunk
to $40 billion, but the U.S. share had climbed to 55 percent,
though in dollar terms it had risen only from $19 billion, to $22
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, governments in France, Britain and Germany
endorsed the idea for a unified company; the plan has since been
supported by Spain, Italy and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some experts caution that seeking to merge the industries of
three or even six countries at once will be almost impossible. Nor
has the global economic slowdown made the task easier. This week,
Boeing said the downturn in Asia would force it to trim production
of commercial jets beginning next year and to cut as many as 20,000
more jobs the next two years than it had earlier indicated.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking recently to British industrialists, Sir Richard of
British Aerospace checked off just some of the thornier choices
facing such a company, including where production sites should be
and where to put groupwide units, like finance and central
management.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as industries are merged, jobs will disappear.
Deciding who remains will be particularly difficult, since Europe's
unemployment rate remains at least double that of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where there are two partners, it is difficult, but just
achievable,'' said John Dowdy, of McKinsey &AMP; Co.'s military
industry group in London. He described the American industry
consolidation, with its two-by-two mergers, as the ``Noah's Ark
formation.'' But ``when you add three or four or more, it becomes
exponentially more difficult,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   John Weston, British Aerospace's chief executive, said the
Pentagon's decision earlier this year to block Lockheed Martin's
bid for Northrop Grumman might have signaled the start of an
American search for trans-Atlantic partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   Michot agreed, adding that Europe must be prepared for such
alliances. Europe's goal, he said, is not to circle the wagons but
``to create conditions in which we are on a level field with the
United States.''

$27.7M AGENCY DEAL UNITES ARNOLD, UK AD SHOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The corporate parent of Arnold Communications has given it an
early holiday gift: its own English ad agency.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder Communications of Bethesda, Md., which bought Arnold in
March, said Wednesday it had acquired Partners BDDH of London in a
stock deal valued at $27.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will unite Boston-based Arnold, New England's largest
ad agency, with one of the largest independent ad agencies in the
United Kingdom. When expressed in terms of US dollars, Partners
BDDH projects annual billings are in the range of $120 million to
$140 million.
</P>
<P>
   With Volkswagen of America and regional groups of McDonald's
franchisees as some of its largest clients, Arnold projects annual
billings of $870 million.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the deal could propel Arnold to its goal of being
the first New England ad agency to record $1 billion in annual
billings.
</P>
<P>
   Partners BDDH, which creates advertising in Europe for clients
such as Mercedes-Benz and Harley Davidson, will continue to operate
as a stand-alone unit, but its chief will report to Arnold chairman
Ed Eskandarian, said Snyder's chief financial officer Clay Perfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Partners BDDH is now an Arnold Communications company,''
Eskandarian said. ``This will be our first step in international
expansion.''
</P>
<P>
   Partners BDDH is part of the Elan Network, an affiliation of
independent ad agencies in most major European countries.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the acquisition will also give Arnold a toehold on
the Continent, Eskandarian said.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Partners BDDH will continue to operate under its
own name.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to retain the characteristics of BDDH,'' said
Eskandarian, who added that those characteristics are very
``consistent'' with Arnold's, he said. Snyder specializes in
data-base direct marketing, and many key clients have been
pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Snyder has been on an acquisition spree,
snapping up similar direct-marketing companies.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to broaden its expertise, Snyder began buying ad
agencies earlier this year. Arnold was its first purchase of a big
ad agency, and Partners BDDH is its second, Perfall said.
</P>
<P>
   After Snyder bought Arnold, Eskandarian was issued a mandate:
Buy more ad agencies. And Partners BDDH is his first big deal for
his new boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the additions of Arnold Communications and Partners BDDH,
Snyder Communications is positioned to offer our clients
world-class creative and brand-building services throughout the
United States, the United Kingdom, and Europe to match our
market-leading data-base and direct-marketing services,'' said
Snyder company founder Daniel M. Snyder in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Snyder fell 1 13/16 to
close at 33.

 &HT;    PalmPilot to feature Internet access
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The faddishly popular PalmPilot will soon come with
Internet access, a wireless feature that will be carried over
BellSouth's burgeoning network.
</P>
<P>
   The makers of the PalmPilot, 3Com Corp., announced Wednesday
that the Net-friendly version of the handheld organizer, available
early next year, will have the ability to ``clip'' data from
various Net sites while the user is on the move _ as long as the
right kind of BellSouth transmission tower is in range.
</P>
<P>
   The PalmPilot, which came to 3Com with its purchase of U.S.
Robotics, now apparently holds the majority share of the market for
handheld computing but that dominance is being challenged by
technology from Microsoft. The souped-up PalmPilot is meant to
exploit both the passion for mobile organizers and the trend toward
wireless communications.
</P>
<P>
   Signals from the PalmPilot to the Net and back will be
transmitted through base stations installed by BellSouth throughout
the country. Neither company would disclose details of the
arrangement, except to say 3Com will pay for the use of the
network.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will bill their customers and we will bill them,'' said
William Lenahan, president of BellSouth Wireless Data.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth already has coverage in the southeast and has the
equipment in 16 other metropolitan areas, with plans for many more,
he said. ``It is very ambitious, but this particular poject is only
one piece of why we are building this out.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth is still rooted in the southeast where it reaps about
$15 billion in revenue from a near-monopoly in local phone service.
However, of late, the $22 billion-a-year company has been branching
out. BellSouth has poured money into Latin America _ mostly to
build wireless phone systems _ while also investing in wireless
phone companies in Houston and Los Angeles. BellSouth recently
launched a national two-way paging service.
</P>
<P>
   The PalmPilot will work over the same network used for
interactive paging, a system designed for data, not voice, Lenahan
said.
</P>
<P>
   The new PalmPilots will be sold by 3Com. BellSouth has talked
about marketing the devices. ``There's no reason why it shouldn't
happen,'' Lenahan said.
</P>
<P>
   Joining in the 3Com announcement were a number of companies
whose technology will mesh with the PalmPilot, including
Atlanta-based UPS, which promised customers the power to check on
the status of deliveries via the device.
</P>
<P>
   The company now permits users to track packages on the Internet.
Dale Hayes, UPS vice president, said it will be the first time such
data will be available to customers through a wireless device.

 &HT;    Editions double up to make forecasts
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If it's December, it must be forecast time for the
nation's business press.
</P>
<P>
   Fortune, in a special year-end double edition, looks at the
future from the viewpoint of investors, asking why they are so
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the very least, the great bull market of the 1990s has
entered a new phase. Suddenly we find ourselves in a world where we
are as concerned about deflation as inflation. Where Internet
stocks flash (and sometimes flame out) ... and each morning we fret
over the latest bulletins from Indonesia and Brazil,'' Fortune
says. ``It's all rather humbling, really.''
</P>
<P>
   Humbling, maybe, but the magazine offers a package of articles
on how to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Worth (December/January), also in a double edition, is just as
somber about the outlook, declaring ``the game has changed. The
world is again a scary place. Genuine risk has returned to
investing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We would probably be better off today if the Federal Reserve
Chairman (Alan Greenspan) had forestalled some of the speculative
excess as the Dow (Jones industrial average) topped 9,300 this
summer. ... Dow 10,000 now seems no more likely to come next than
Dow 7,000 (or below),'' the magazine says.
</P>
<P>
   Money offers its year-end advice in a special financial guide in
addition to its regular magazine. In it, the personal finance
publication advises readers to take care of 1998 details before
moving on to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine lists 25 ``moves to make now'' that will lower
taxes and save money, and eight ``use it or lose it'' benefits that
expire at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, Money assembled a panel of six analysts who agree
growth will be slower in 1999 but disagree widely about everything
else.
</P>
<P>
   Take that, chauvinist
</P>
<P>
   Business Week cover story on chief executive officer vacancies,
illustrated by an empty pair of men's wing-tip shoes, was too much
for the editors of Working Woman.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to use a pair of men's shoes instead of an empty
desk or chair conveyed the idea that only men are qualified for
such positions, said Bernadette Grey, editor-in-chief of Working
Woman.

 &HT;    Atlanta's appeal slipping among foreign real estate investing
group
 &HT;    By Sallye Salter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Metro Atlanta's real estate market took another hit
Wednesday when a survey of foreign investors showed the city, which
was top-ranked in the mid-1990s, has declined to fifth among U.S.
cities in investment potential.
</P>
<P>
   The gap was wide between top-ranked Washington, D.C., which
scored 44, and Atlanta, which scored 4, in the annual poll by the
Washington-based Association of Foreign Investors in Real Estate.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the group's 145 members, mostly Europeans,
responded to the survey asking them to rank the top five U.S.
cities for foreign investment potential.
</P>
<P>
   New York scored second-highest; San Francisco, third; and
Boston, fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Metro Atlanta, which was fourth a year ago, was ranked No. 1 in
the survey in 1994, 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The poll results were the latest in a string of reports over the
past year that reflect investors' concerns about the area's excess
construction, as well as constraints on growth caused by
infrastructure problems.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the foreign investors' plans for investment in
U.S. real estate in general are more cautious than a year ago.
Forty-two percent of the respondents said they would increase their
U.S. investment in the year ahead, down from 67 percent in last
year's survey.
</P>
<P>
   While domestic turmoil among both real estate investment trusts
and capital markets has created opportunities for these investors,
``the optimism of foreign investors has been tempered by continuing
concerns about a global recession,'' said David Golden, chairman of
the investors' association.

 &HT;    Russell to move key operations to Cobb County, Ga.
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Russell Corp., maker of sportswear and Major League
Baseball uniforms, has picked Cobb County's booming
Cumberland-Galleria district over several sites in north Fulton for
the relocation of several key divisions from its headquarters in
Alexander City, Ala. Russell said Atlanta will be its
``co-headquarters.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell, the nation's largest athletic clothing manufacturer
with $1.23 billion in revenue, announced in July it would establish
co-headquarters in Atlanta. The company will transfer 100 to 150
high-level corporate employees, including division presidents and
the chief financial officer. Russell Chairman and Chief Executive
Jack Ward will have offices in both Alexander City and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Initial plans call for the construction of a 250,000-square-foot
building on Cumberland Boulevard west of South Cobb Parkway.
Russell said it plans to execute a formal lease and joint venture
agreement on the building by Jan. 15. The property, which is under
contract by Pope and Land Enterprises, will go before the Cobb
County Board of Commissioners Dec. 15 for rezoning.
</P>
<P>
   The company will soon sign a letter of intent on the site,
according to a recent letter from Ward to broker and developer Pope
&AMP; Land.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Cumberland) was selected from an extensive list of
alternatives, primarily located in north Fulton County,'' Ward's
letter said. The letter said the commitment was contingent on
rezoning. Ward could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Russell hopes to move into its new headquarters by mid-2000,
said Russell spokeswoman Nancy Young. Construction will take 12 to
18 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the meantime, we're looking for temporary sites to begin
moving employees early next year,'' Young said. One potential
temporary site includes the nearby Atlanta Galleria.
</P>
<P>
   The relocation is part of a major restructuring by Russell,
which is in the midst of cutting more than 20 percent of its work
force and moving most of its sewing operations to Mexico and
Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   The new Atlanta headquarters is part of the company's increased
focus on marketing and advertising its brands, which include
Russell Athletic team uniforms, Jerzees sweatshirts and sweatpants
and Cross Creek golf wear. Young said the move from Alexander City,
a rural community of 15,000 about 50 miles northwest of Montgomery,
will make it easier to recruit top-notch marketing talent.

 &HT;    UPS expands in its 'last frontier,' Latin America
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ United Parcel Service is moving to enlarge its Latin
America toehold by buying a small shipping company in Argentina, a
key market.
</P>
<P>
   The Sandy Springs, Ga.-based delivery company said it is
acquiring the assets of Union Pak S.A. for an undisclosed price and
will use them to establish its own operations under the banner UPS
de Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   UPS has used Union Pak as a contractor to test the Argentine
market.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina becomes the third South American nation, along with
Brazil and Chile, in which UPS has operations. It uses contractors
to serve other countries but remains well behind rivals DHL
Worldwide and Federal Express in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Scherck, president of Marietta, Ga.-based consulting firm
Colography Group, said the buyout alone will not significantly
boost UPS' position in South America.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``It may very well be the first signs of an
emerging strategy similar to what what UPS did in Europe.'' UPS in
the late 1980s began buying local firms in Europe, absorbing huge
losses before seeing profits in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Heraclio Rojas, UPS' Latin American marketing manager, said the
company now has only a ``single digit'' market share of
international air shipments in Argentina but believes it can
quickly add to that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plans are to attain a 25 percent market share on exports
and imports,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The move follows a recent UPS deal to use air rights held by
cargo carrier Challenge Air to fly between the United States and
Brazil five times a week. Contract carriers will feed cargo from
Argentina and other nations to the UPS flights.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas said Union Pak has 62 employees and UPS expects to add
more. He called South America UPS' ``last frontier'' and said the
company is not discouraged by a cooling Latin economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see it as an opportunity because customers will be looking
for alternatives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   UPS has had a Latin America and Caribbean regional headquarters
near Miami since 1989.

 &HT;    Cable, broadcast industries find much in common
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ When a cable TV operator bashes broadcasters
today, it's not unlike hitting a brother on the head.
</P>
<P>
   Cable and broadcasting have become that entwined. Nowhere was
that more evident than at the opening of the cable industry trade
convention called the Western Show, being held here Wednesday
through Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Seated side-by-side on stage were Bob Wright, NBC chief
executive, and Leo J. Hindery Jr., president of giant cable
operator Tele-Communications Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Wright and Hindery weren't exactly making kissy-face. But they
did agree more than disagree as part of a panel on the future of
the cable TV industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue for us is not just getting bigger,'' said Wright,
whose company owns cable channels MSNBC and CNBC. ``The issue is
are we in businesses that are getting bigger because opportunity is
growing quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Hindery, whose company is being bought by AT&AMP;T, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years from now 50 percent of our revenue will come from
new businesses,'' he added, referring to the fact cable lines are
increasingly being used to deliver telephone service and high-speed
access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Wright and Hindery discussed the industry in front of several
thousand cable industry executives. Other panelists were Barry
Diller, chairman of USA Networks and the force behind an attempt to
create a hybrid cable-broadcast network, and Gordon Crawford, the
industry's leading investor.
</P>
<P>
   All saw tremendous opportunity as operators continue to lay
digital wires, capable of delivering everything from
high-definition television to telephone service to CD-quality music
to Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   But all saw great danger, too. Crawford, for one, scolded the
audience for not taking digital satellite operators such as DirecTV
more seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Satellite will add 2.5 million new subscribers this year,
while cable will add only 1 million,'' said Crawford, who runs Los
Angeles-based investment fund Capital Research and Management Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means satellite will capture 60 percent of the growth in
new subscribers.''
</P>
<P>
   Crawford urged operators to speed introduction of new digital
services to stay competitive, but Hindery said that was not easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one should underestimate the difficulty of delivering these
new services,'' said Hindery.

 &HT;    Cable execs urged not to increase prices
 &HT;    WITH WESTERNCABLE-COLOR
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The president of the National Cable Television
Association called on his members Wednesday to ``restrain price''
increases to cable subscribers through at least next March.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must make price restraint our top priority,'' Decker
Anstrom told a gathering of some several thousand cable television
executives at the opening of the big industry gathering, the
Western Show.
</P>
<P>
   ``If not, our careful success of the past several years will be
swept away.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing of Anstrom's call is not arbitrary. Federal price
regulation of the cable TV industry is scheduled to expire in
March. But many fear Congress would be tempted to re-regulate the
industry if operators once again initiate steep price increases.
</P>
<P>
   Anstrom is not alone. Other industry leaders have also called
for restraint in price increases, including Jim Robbins, president
and chief executive of Atlanta-based Cox Communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the industry overall has tried to be cautious,'' said
Robbins, ``although we've had a few strays raise rates too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry data supports Robbins' assessment. A recent survey in
industry trade magazine, CableWorld, show most operators including
Cox Communications and MediaOne plan rate increases in the 5
percent range for next year.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, this year, MediaOne, which owns the largest
single system in metro Atlanta, raised its rates an average of 7
percent to 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry executives, though, worry that some in Washington
still will want to regulate cable TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I made a list of the industry's top challenges, it would
read 'Washington, Washington, Washington,''' says Gordon Crawford,
who runs the media investment fund Capital Research and Management
Co.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, U.S. Representatives Billy Tauzin (R-La.) and Edward
Markey (D-Mass.) are sponsoring a bill that would give
municipalities the power to continue regulating cable after federal
laws expire on March 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is going to continue to play an important role
in how this industry performs,'' says Crawford.

RUSSIA VOWS TO RETURN SOME ART LOOTED IN WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Russia announced here Wednesday that it would
return some World War II booty to individual claimants and
contribute information from its archives to an international
database on looted art.
</P>
<P>
   By giving ground on those fronts, Valery Kulishov, the director
of the restitution department at the Russian Culture Ministry,
surprised a conference on Holocaust-era assets that is shaping up
as something of a diplomatic revival meeting, with delegates from
country after country reporting on how they are grappling with
restitution to those who lost art or other property during the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we find an object of art and there is definite proof that
it belongs to a victim of the Holocaust, there is no law in Russia
that would prevent quick and just restitution to the victim or his
legal successor,'' Kulishov said in an interview. Most conference
sessions are not open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Kulishov made clear that the offer did not extend to so-called
trophy art, the works taken by Soviet troops from Germany and
Eastern Europe that the Russians consider to be reparations for the
wartime ravages their country suffered. The Russian parliament has
repeatedly refused to consider the return of trophy art, now in the
Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts in Moscow and the Hermitage in
St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   Nikolai Gubenko, a member of the Russian parliament who is also
a delegate, defended the law that essentially nationalizes trophy
art and said the Russian people should be recognized as victims,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Several art experts at the conference, which includes delegates
from 44 countries and 13 Jewish and Gypsy groups, hailed the
Russian announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great step forward,'' said Lynn H. Nicholas, the author
of ``The Rape of Europa: The Fate of Europe's Treasures in the
Third Reich and the Second World War'' (Alfred A. Knopf, 1994). ``I
don't believe the Russians have ever said publicly that they would
give anything back.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Petropoulos, a historian at Loyola College in
Baltimore, said, ``For the Russians to say they are prepared to
make a database of what's in their repositories is very
significant, real movement on their part.''
</P>
<P>
   Kulishov said Russia would respond to inquiries about its
wartime records, although it would not open them to scholars, as
some countries do. As for potential claims, he said he had ``no
idea how much art is involved,'' adding, ``If something belongs to
a Holocaust victim, we will search for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics pointed out that Kulishov gave no specific information
about what constituted proof or how claims would be handled, except
that they should be made by a government on behalf of individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did he indicate how Russia would view complicated situations
like that of the Gutmann family of Vienna, a case recently
uncovered by Oliver Rathkolb of the Kreisky Archives and Institute
for Contemporary History at the University of Vienna. He said 41
Rembrandt engravings owned by the Gutmanns were seized by Hitler's
forces, then taken by Soviet forces. ``I think it would qualify,''
Rathkolb said.
</P>
<P>
   But as with all announcements and developments at the
conference, there are no enforcement mechanisms other than the
desire to maintain international standing. ``Every government
talked of doing something, and how serious they are it is hard to
judge,'' Ms. Nicholas said. ``But having said something in public,
it would be hard to retreat.''
</P>
<P>
   Retreat may be difficult. Ronald Lauder, the wealthy cosmetics
heir who is chairman of the World Jewish Congress' Commission for
Art Recovery and chairman of the Museum of Modern Art in New York,
railed at the Netherlands for saying it would take three years to
research works of questionable provenance in its state collections,
when he believed that it should take six months. And Lauder faulted
France, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Germany for holding on to
works that belong to Jews.
</P>
<P>
   No one actually knows how much Nazi-looted art is missing, said
Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat, who is chairman of the
conference. Petropoulos has estimated that perhaps 10,000 to
100,000 works of unknown value are missing. Nearly every speaker
has called for greater openness with archival records and sharing
of information in an easily accessible international database.
</P>
<P>
   Most sessions at this conference, attended by 44 countries and
13 Jewish and Gypsy groups and sponsored by the State Department
and the Holocaust Memorial Museum, are not open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   In a briefing for reporters, Eizenstat reported new commitments
from Spain and Slovenia to contribute to the gold fund created a
year ago to compensate Holocaust survivors. He said Hungary and the
Czech Republic would join a global effort to compensate Jews who
lost insurance assets.

 &HT;    CARE changes with times
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Fifty years ago, the new international relief
organization called CARE delivered boxes of food and supplies to
Europeans struggling to recover from the ravages of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   And many Europeans were profoundly grateful.
</P>
<P>
   But CARE officials know they could never get away today with
doing what they did then. Those boxes _ the original CARE packages
_ would be completely unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   They contained peanut butter, which was alien to the native
population. They contained candy, which is not nutritious. And they
contained cigarettes, which damage health.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is in a different place today,'' said Peter Bell,
CARE's president. ``Today, I think the world expects more.''
</P>
<P>
   The growing realization that aid can sometimes do as much harm
as good _ that it can foster dependence and even fuel wars _ has
prompted relief organizations like CARE, which since 1993 has been
headquartered in Atlanta, to change the way they deliver it.
</P>
<P>
   CARE, Bell said, pays greater attention now to the cultural and
economic context in which its aid is delivered. And, in some areas
torn by war, CARE has not only delivered food but lobbied for
peace.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics say that is not enough. They contend that the whole
idea of aid is wrong, that what is needed is investment rather than
charity, and that aid too often harms the people it is intended to
help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the current system needs to be dismantled,'' said
Michael Maren, an author and former aid worker whose book, ``The
Road to Hell,'' offers sharp criticism of international aid
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   But Bell said the delivery of aid needs to be improved, not
scrapped. When people are dying, he said, the only ethical choice
is to save lives.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, humanitarian aid seems easy to understand and to
deliver.
</P>
<P>
   When Hurricane Mitch leaves people in Honduras and Nicaragua
with no food, shelter or clean water, those necessities must be
provided. When people in Sudan are starving, they need food. When
people flee mass murder in Rwanda, they need a safe haven, a place
to stay, something to eat.
</P>
<P>
   Few people dispute those basic assertions.
</P>
<P>
   But even aid officials agree, however, that delivering aid,
however badly it is needed, can also cause harm.
</P>
<P>
   Sheltering and feeding people in Central America can foster
dependence. Airlifting food into Sudan can draw people off their
land and help sustain that country's 15-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   And running camps for refugees from Rwanda, in addition to
saving lives, probably provided a safe haven to genocidal killers.
</P>
<P>
   Mary B. Anderson, of the Local Capacities for Peace Project in
Cambridge, Mass., has studied the challenges of delivering aid.
Though she believes assistance can be rendered effectively, she
suggests that aid workers, like physicians, should take the
Hippocratic oath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Understanding that the best-intentioned humanitarian or
development assistance can inadvertently also do harm,'' she wrote
in 1996, ``they should also declare that they will `First do no
harm.'''
</P>
<P>
   CARE delivers aid in a much different way today than it did 10
years ago, Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   As it engages in a major effort to help people in Nicaragua and
Honduras, two countries devastated in October by Hurricane Mitch,
CARE is trying to meet victims's immediate needs without fostering
long-term dependency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as little as five years ago, we would talk about a
relief-to-recovery-to-development continuum,'' Bell said. ``And we
have become acutely aware that this is not so much a continuum, and
that we need to be thinking about all of these elements _ relief,
recovery and development _ all the time that we are working with
people in extreme poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   Thinking only about victims' immediate needs, critical as they
are, could foster not only dependency but despondency, he said.
Over time, gratitude could become mixed with resentment.
</P>
<P>
   So, while sheltering and feeding people, CARE is working
simultaneously on development programs _ planning to have people
work in exchange for food, perhaps cleaning their communities, and
ordering seeds and tools to distribute so people can again become
self-sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Bell said it will be six to nine months before any semblance of
normalcy returns to Nicaragua and Honduras, but the planning must
begin now.
</P>
<P>
   ``CARE's whole reason for being is to help people help
themselves,'' he said. ``And it's important for the self-respect
and the well-being of the people with whom we're working that they
be able to, insofar as possible, support themselves, to earn a
living on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation in Honduras is a one-time emergency from which a
recovery can envisioned. But Sudan, where a civil war has been
fought for 15 years, poses more difficult challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Maren, the author who is critical of international aid agencies,
said that some portion of the food aid is siphoned off by the rival
armies; that food, he said, has helped fuel this long-running
conflict, with disastrous consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible that this war would not still be going on if it
had not been for all this aid going in over the years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he noted the damage to the society of southern Sudanese
people caused by feeding stations _ damage acknowledged by many aid
workers in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The famine camp is a logistical necessity for aid groups, but
it is a cultural disaster,'' Maren said. ``You have an entire
generation of kids who have grown up in the camps. They don't have
the survival skills that their parents have. You have a breakdown
of traditional authority. The kids who grow up in these camps are
great fodder for the rebel armies.''
</P>
<P>
   CARE does not dismiss that analysis out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are constantly trying to sort through issues just like
those,'' Bell said. ``And we are responding differently today than
the way we might have responded 10 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, other issues demand consideration, too, he said, such as
all the people who will die if no food is provided.
</P>
<P>
   This summer CARE set up feeding stations in the southern
Sudanese city of Wau. Tens of thousands of people walked five days
or even 10 to reach the food. Hundreds probably died along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was our choice?'' Bell asked. ``Food was the difference
between life and death. And we responded by feeding those people.
Ethically, there was absolutely no choice.''
</P>
<P>
   But recognizing that the war had greatly exacerbated the famine,
CARE abandoned its traditional apolitical stance and ``felt it
important to crank up a full advocacy strategy with regard to
Sudan,'' Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   CARE lobbied both sides to extend a cease-fire that was set to
expire this fall. And CARE took the lead role in organizing four of
the world's largest relief agencies _ CARE, Oxfam, Medecins Sans
Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) and Save the Children Fund _
to jointly urge the U.N. Security Council to take an active role in
ending the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The genocide in Rwanda posed its own excruciating ethical
dilemmas. In 1994, about 500,000 Rwandans were killed in ethnic
fighting. More than a million people fled the slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   But refugee camps set up just outside Rwanda's borders offered a
safe haven not only to desperate women and children, but to people
who had organized, and who continued to perpetrate, massive ethnic
murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember myself visiting the camps at Ngara in Tanzania,''
Bell said, ``and staying up much of the night talking with CARE
staff _ you know, should we remain, should we go? Under what
circumstances should we remain? And in the end they felt strongly
that we had to remain because of all the innocent children, that we
just couldn't turn our backs on them.''
</P>
<P>
   CARE tried to discriminate, insisting, for example, on
distributing food only to women rather than to men who might use it
for paramilitary purposes.
</P>
<P>
   But CARE did not control the camps, it had no security forces,
and in the end the choice was either to stay or to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not clear-cut choices,'' Bell said. ``Maybe the world
has become more complex. But certainly we have become more
sensitive to the broader context in which we are working.''

 &HT;    Lottery winner breaks losing streak
 &HT;    By Jingle Davis
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUNSWICK, Ga. _ Kenny Dukes, whose lengthy criminal record
surfaced after he picked up $10.65 million in lottery winnings this
week, said he felt so ashamed of stealing from his mother three
years ago that he decided to turn his life around or kill himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''While I was sitting in jail, I felt so low, all I wanted to do
was end my life. All I wanted was to see my parents one more time
and let them know I was sorry,'' Dukes, 40, said in an interview
here Wednesday at his attorneys' office.
</P>
<P>
   After his 1995 arrest for burglarizing a Brunswick business and
homes, including his mother's, he planned to ''do a plunge'' off of
a second-tier balcony onto the concrete floor at the Glynn County
jail, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Dukes said, a dream convinced him he could become
''someone my parents could be proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything has changed since I'm not drinking and drugging
anymore,'' Dukes said. ''That Kenny Dukes is not the person sitting
here before you today.''
</P>
<P>
   Released from prison to a Savannah halfway house in 1996, Dukes
was hired by a Savannah architectural concrete company, quickly
working his way up from an hourly wage position to plant
superintendent. He swore off alcohol and drugs, he said. A former
acolyte in the Lutheran church, he became a regular churchgoer,
Dukes said.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, he bought a small cottage on the marsh near
Midway and redeveloped a good relationship with his parents. He
also began planning a construction business with his brother, Eric,
in Brunswick. That's still his plan; though a new multimillionaire,
he is required to work while he remains on parole until 2001. He
must also meet a curfew and pass periodic drug tests.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Topetzes, state director of parole, said he hopes Dukes
will succeed in turning around his life, but the agency will treat
Dukes the same as any other parolee. ``If he violates parole, he's
going to be the wealthiest inmate in the Georgia prison system,''
said Topetzes.
</P>
<P>
   Dukes said he felt successful and good about himself, even
before he learned he'd won the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   The Sept. 19 jackpot of $31 million was the largest in its
history. Dukes waited about two and a half months to claim his
prize, opting for an after-tax cash payout that amounted to about a
third of the total jackpot that would have been paid over a 30-year
period. Asked why he made that choice, he said, ''I'm not ignorant.
I knew I could do a lot more with it in 30 years than (lottery)
officials could.''
</P>
<P>
   He withheld the big news from most his family until Thanksgiving
dinner. After he announced his good fortune, his 16-year-old niece
asked if this meant she could afford to go to college.
</P>
<P>
   Dukes blamed alcohol and drug abuse for a lengthy list of
felonies he committed in Georgia and at least three other states.
</P>
<P>
   According to state records, Dukes, who sometimes had used the
alias David Lee McKenzie, was in Georgia prisons three times and in
a South Carolina prison once since the late 1970s. Records show he
had been charged with a variety of felonies, including aggravated
assault, theft, robbery, drunken driving, fraud, domestic violence,
simple battery, tresspassing and obstruction of a police officer.
At age 18, he said, he was dishonorably discharged from the Navy _
which he joined at 17 _ for using alcohol and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''At age 14, I discovered drugs, rock and roll and women,''
Dukes said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has not touched alcohol or marijuana since being
arrested in 1995 for stealing jewelry worth $1,400 from his
mother's trailer and $80 in change from her truck. He also broke
into a Brunswick doughnut shop and house owned by Gary and Jeannine
Share, who had befriended Dukes and his former wife, Sherri.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Share, who now owns a music store, said Dukes wrote to him,
apologizing, while he was in jail and has called since getting out
to ask if they could meet face-to-face.
</P>
<P>
   ''When he called, I told him I didn't really want to have
anything to do with him,'' Share said. ''I felt the friendship had
been violated. But afterwards, I felt I'd spoken too hastily.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Share said, he would hesitate to meet with Dukes, ''because
it would seem I was meeting with him because he's suddenly rich,''
he said. ''I'm not interested in that.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not, however, rule out the possibility of seeing Dukes
''without anybody knowing about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Share, most coastal residents seemed willing to forgive and
forget.
</P>
<P>
   In Darien, where Dukes bought his winning lottery ticket, folks
sat around the popular ''family table'' at Archie's Restaurant,
discussing the big winner and his checkered past.
</P>
<P>
   ''Given the premise of the lottery, I'm not sure it makes sense
to deny a winner because he's a felon,'' said Fred Stregles, the
restaurant's new owner. ''Besides, if I had a winning ticket and I
was a felon, you better believe I could get someone to go pick up
my money for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Darien resident Earl Duncan, who owns storage units in town,
joked about McIntosh County's shady history as a landing place for
shrimpboats loaded with bales of marijuana. At the moment,
residents are fuming over an audit that showed about $100,000
missing from the tax commissioner's office.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dukes seems like he'd fit right in here,'' Duncan said.
</P>
<P>
   George Wallace, a commercial crabber from Cox, said, ''Are you
sure he's not from McIntosh County?
</P>
<P>
   Even the retired clerk of superior court, Adam ''Junior''
Poppell, was inclined to be forgiving of Dukes' past.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe if he's been in that much trouble, maybe he needed (the
winnings) worse than anybody else,'' Poppell said.

RUSSIA VOWS TO RETURN SOME ART LOOTED IN WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Russia announced here Wednesday that it would
return some World War II booty to individual claimants and
contribute information from its archives to an international
database on looted art.
</P>
<P>
   By giving ground on those fronts, Valery Kulishov, the director
of the restitution department at the Russian Culture Ministry,
surprised a conference on Holocaust-era assets that is shaping up
as something of a diplomatic revival meeting, with delegates from
country after country reporting on how they are grappling with
restitution to those who lost art or other property during the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we find an object of art and there is definite proof that
it belongs to a victim of the Holocaust, there is no law in Russia
that would prevent quick and just restitution to the victim or his
legal successor,'' Kulishov said in an interview. Most conference
sessions are not open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Kulishov made clear that the offer did not extend to so-called
trophy art, the works taken by Soviet troops from Germany and
Eastern Europe that the Russians consider to be reparations for the
wartime ravages their country suffered. The Russian parliament has
repeatedly refused to consider the return of trophy art, now in the
Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts in Moscow and the Hermitage in
St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   Nikolai Gubenko, a member of the Russian parliament who is also
a delegate, defended the law that essentially nationalizes trophy
art and said the Russian people should be recognized as victims,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Several art experts at the conference, which includes delegates
from 44 countries and 13 Jewish and Gypsy groups, hailed the
Russian announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great step forward,'' said Lynn H. Nicholas, the author
of ``The Rape of Europa: The Fate of Europe's Treasures in the
Third Reich and the Second World War'' (Alfred A. Knopf, 1994). ``I
don't believe the Russians have ever said publicly that they would
give anything back.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Petropoulos, a historian at Loyola College in
Baltimore, said, ``For the Russians to say they are prepared to
make a database of what's in their repositories is very
significant, real movement on their part.''
</P>
<P>
   Kulishov said Russia would respond to inquiries about its
wartime records, although it would not open them to scholars, as
some countries do. As for potential claims, he said he had ``no
idea how much art is involved,'' adding, ``If something belongs to
a Holocaust victim, we will search for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics pointed out that Kulishov gave no specific information
about what constituted proof or how claims would be handled, except
that they should be made by a government on behalf of individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did he indicate how Russia would view complicated situations
like that of the Gutmann family of Vienna, a case recently
uncovered by Oliver Rathkolb of the Kreisky Archives and Institute
for Contemporary History at the University of Vienna. He said 41
Rembrandt engravings owned by the Gutmanns were seized by Hitler's
forces, then taken by Soviet forces. ``I think it would qualify,''
Rathkolb said.
</P>
<P>
   But as with all announcements and developments at the
conference, there are no enforcement mechanisms other than the
desire to maintain international standing. ``Every government
talked of doing something, and how serious they are it is hard to
judge,'' Ms. Nicholas said. ``But having said something in public,
it would be hard to retreat.''
</P>
<P>
   Retreat may be difficult. Ronald Lauder, the wealthy cosmetics
heir who is chairman of the World Jewish Congress' Commission for
Art Recovery and chairman of the Museum of Modern Art in New York,
railed at the Netherlands for saying it would take three years to
research works of questionable provenance in its state collections,
when he believed that it should take six months. And Lauder faulted
France, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Germany for holding on to
works that belong to Jews.
</P>
<P>
   No one actually knows how much Nazi-looted art is missing, said
Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat, who is chairman of the
conference. Petropoulos has estimated that perhaps 10,000 to
100,000 works of unknown value are missing. Nearly every speaker
has called for greater openness with archival records and sharing
of information in an easily accessible international database.
</P>
<P>
   Most sessions at this conference, attended by 44 countries and
13 Jewish and Gypsy groups and sponsored by the State Department
and the Holocaust Memorial Museum, are not open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   In a briefing for reporters, Eizenstat reported new commitments
from Spain and Slovenia to contribute to the gold fund created a
year ago to compensate Holocaust survivors. He said Hungary and the
Czech Republic would join a global effort to compensate Jews who
lost insurance assets.

AFTER ACQUITTAL, ESPY CRITICIZES INDEPENDENT COUNSEL
</HEADLINE>
  (With ESPY-ACQUIT)  
(sw) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After four years of harrowing investigation and two
months of sitting mute through his trial, Mike Espy broke his
silence on Wednesday, alternating bursts of exultation at his
acquittal with condemnation of the independent counsel's failed
$17-million dragnet effort to put him in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each and every day I read the 27th Psalm,'' said Espy, the
former secretary of agriculture, beaming gratefully outside the
courthouse in having prevailed against corruption charges. ``And it
basically says that the Lord is my light and my salvation. Whom
shall I fear? Certainly not Donald Smaltz.''
</P>
<P>
   Smaltz, the independent counsel, was among the special
prosecutors who have been conducting seven separate investigations
of Clinton administration officials over the last six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cost a lot,'' said Espy, eying nearby his brother, Henry,
who was indicted then acquitted in the independent counsel's
multiple prosecutions, but too late for last election day when he
lost his job as mayor of Clarksdale, Miss. ``It's been tough,''
said Mike Espy.
</P>
<P>
   At his side, one of his lawyers, Ted Wells, celebrated the
verdict as a double victory _ for Espy personally and for critics
who feel the hefty investigatory and budget powers of the
independent counsel law must be reined in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, the United States Congress will look at this
victory and decide to change the independent counsel statute and
put both Donald Smaltz and Kenneth Starr out of business,'' said
Wells, referring to the best known independent counsel, Starr, who
has recommended the impeachment of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   With public opinion remaining strong behind the president in his
own investigatory travails, the fairness of the independent counsel
law itself has come under increasing doubt as it faces renewal by
Congress next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision is probably another nail in the coffin for the
independent counsel statute, which was in a lot of trouble to begin
with,'' said Irv Nathan, a former Justice Department prosecutor who
has studied the law on behalf of the American Bar Association. ``It
will be perceived as another example of excessive exuberance by an
independent counsel and of poor judgment,'' he said of the Espy
prosecution, stressing that the public's perception of fairness is
crucial if the independent counsel statute is to be workable.
</P>
<P>
   Espy described how he returned home to Yazoo City, Miss., for
sustenance over the past four years. ``The people there took me
in,'' he said, ``They knew that none of this was true.''
</P>
<P>
   Hometown friends helped him raise legal defense funds at
$25-a-bowl soup pot rallies. ``This is good news for Yazoo City,''
said Joseph Thomas, vice president of Guaranty National Bank, who
thought the president may owe Espy an apology for jettisoning him
so quickly. ``They pounced on him pretty hard,'' Thomas said, but
Espy kept the faith with his supporters back home, whom he
previously served in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' said Espy, ``They didn't believe the cynicism and the
levels of acrimony thrown at you, such as have been thrown here in
Washington, D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   In his joy, Espy sparked laughter as he described how his own
troubles provided an almost total distraction from the president's
troubles. ``You may not believe it, but I barely know who Monica
Lewinsky is,'' he said, smiling. ``So I really have not paid much
attention to it, and I just wish him well.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the indepedent counsel law have argued that it lacks
safeguards against politically biased and zealous prosecutors
ranging across the land in a veritable ``parade of horribles,'' to
use the phrase of Walter Dellinger, a former Justice Department
official in the Clinton administration who opposes renewal of the
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the cure is even worse than the disease,'' said
Dellinger. ``The law may lead to a kind of all-or-nothing strategy
once $17 million has been spent,'' he said. The high stakes leave
no leeway, he said, for the sort of plea bargaining to misdemeanor
counts as might happen in standard criminal procedures for some of
the activities that independent counsels delve into.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether his ordeal had soured him on public service, Espy
cryptically told of how, as he was forced from the administration,
he met ``man to man, person to person'' with President Clinton to
profess his absolute innocence. ``He looked me in the eye and we
talked and he made a promise to me,'' said Espy, declining to spell
it out. ``I'm hopeful that he'll keep that promise.''
</P>
<P>
   Espy described the ordeal of withstanding a full-scale
independent counsel investigation as a test of physical as much as
spiritual courage. ``He's not unlike any other schoolyard bully,''
he said of Smaltz. ``You've got to stand up to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Having survived the independent counsel's charges, Espy stood
outside the court and looked back 11 years to the Reagan
administration and the independent counsel prosecution of Labor
Secretary Raymond Donovan. Donovan was acquitted of fraud charges
after a lengthy, costly struggle. Donovan's parting comment, still
widely remembered by politicians here, was, ``Where do I go to get
back my reputation?''
</P>
<P>
   As he prepared to leave the court a free man, Espy commented,
``I won't repeat that because I don't believe that I ever lost my
good name.''

PALMEIRO DESERVES THE CREDIT FOR ENGINEERING THIS REUNION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
I was beginning to wonder. Was it us? Was the drawl too slow, was
it our thing about chicken-frying a steak, were there too many
pickups barreling down our roads, was it the crispy-fried summer
heat?
<TEXT>
<P>
   The word got out that Randy Johnson's wife didn't care to move
here. And Todd Stottlemyre's wife didn't care to stay here.
Personally, I didn't care enough to ask why.
</P>
<P>
   Both free-agent pitchers ended up in Arizona, which if nothing
else blows the summer heat theory.
</P>
<P>
   But while unloved by others, at least Rafael Palmeiro has given
back our dignity. And while not exactly giving the Rangers what
they need _ a rotation ace _ the surprising return of Rafael gives
the Rangers what they claim they want in a high-dollar star player
_ loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Go far beyond the numbers, financial and on the field. This took
a major reconstruction for Palmeiro to return, and Rafael did most
of the work himself.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, the bridge he crossed leaving town wasn't merely
burned. The damage went far beyond that. This bridge was nuked.
With Arlington in his rearview mirror, all that remained of
Palmeiro's ties with the Rangers was a pile of rubble that glowed.
</P>
<P>
   Ugliness prevailed. At his most angry moment, Rafael accused the
Rangers of an anti-Latin player bias, which was silly, and he knew
it. But as Palmeiro, in his bitterness, constantly lashed out at
Tom Schieffer and that era of Rangers' ownership, one thing became
clear.
</P>
<P>
   The departure from Arlington devastated Palmeiro. The more he
squawked, the more we knew he hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Blame Schieffer, blame Rafael, blame Rafael's agent for what
happened. But as much, if not more, than any player who has passed
through here, Palmeiro came to represent the Rangers' stated goal
of suiting up good citizens who want to play here, stay here and
produce on the field here.
</P>
<P>
   For five long seasons, Palmeiro fulfilled the good-citizen and
staying-here requirements _ his permanent home remained in
Colleyville. Unfortunately, the playing and producing huge numbers
were done in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly but surely, however, the bridge back to Arlington began
to take shape. Palmeiro never gave up on the idea of coming home,
and constantly hinted at such in conversations with news media
members during his Baltimore days.
</P>
<P>
   But for that bridge to actually rise again _ and certainly
Schieffer had to turn the other cheek for it to happen _ don't rule
out a re-welcome mat here for Kevin Brown, Jimmy Johnson, Jason
Kidd, Yvonne Gonzalez, Pat Sullivan, etc. Palmeiro's return tells
us that anything is possible.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Melvin inadvertently had the most telling comment about
Rafael's return. Talking about the private meeting Tuesday that
Palmeiro requested, the general manager said, ``I heard a
\Rfinancial\S number from Rafael that I hadn't heard from his
agent.'' That number would work for Melvin.
</P>
<P>
   Follow along here:
</P>
<P>
   What Rafael told Pudge, Kenny told Rafael. What Rafael told
Kenny, Rafael didn't tell himself five years ago, and Kenny also
ignored two years later.
</P>
<P>
   Believe me, all of the above makes perfect sense.
</P>
<P>
   Former Rangers pitcher Kenny Rogers, in a conversation with
Palmeiro on Tuesday morning, had advised him, ``If you want to make
it possible in Texas, you can make it possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, with the Rangers and Pudge Rodriguez at a
negotiating impasse, Palmeiro had called from Baltimore with the
same advice for Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Without his agent, Pudge asked Schieffer for a face-to-face
meeting. The deal was done. The same thing happened Tuesday for
Palmeiro, sans agent.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro, again while in Baltimore, had given Rogers that advice
when the pitcher was about to leave the Rangers via free agency.
But Rogers never followed through, and departed. Palmeiro had
learned through experience. When he left five years ago, it was in
a swirl of confusion about whether his agent had overplayed the
hand. But the main deal-breaker was that Palmeiro did not become
personally involved in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Every player needs an agent _ absolutely. But at some point, if
that player wants to ``make it happen'' with a certain team, he has
to take charge. Most, however, don't.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro did this time, and he's better off in Arlington because
he obviously loves the place. The Rangers are better off with
Palmeiro because of what he means in the batting order and
defensively at first base.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers made an all-out effort to improve their pitching by
signing Johnson. When Johnson's wife balked, at least the team
improved somewhere else, while the search for pitching goes on.
</P>
<P>
   One bridge, so to speak, was crossed. A bridge that Palmeiro
personally rebuilt.

`CHILDREN OF THE FIELDS': TOO BUSY WORKING TO GO TO SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   For 11-year-old James Flores, school is a sometime, somewhere
thing. He spends much of the year on the road in his family's
breakdown-prone old van traveling thousands of miles with his
father and seven brothers and sisters in hopes of catching a few
weeks of picking at harvest time.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of '98, as chronicled in Friday night's ``Dateline
NBC,'' it was a grueling four-month trip; if the oil pump didn't
conk out, it was the transmission. Working for less than the
minimum wage, the family didn't make enough to meet expenses and
ended up dragging back home to Texas worse off than when they
started. The focus of this report by Dennis Murphy is on James, who
by law should not have been working at all, the minimum legal age
for farm workers being 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children of the Fields'' is sketchy about the numbers of the
under-aged out picking, and, unlike famous past exposes, it doesn't
dwell on the conditions in which migrant workers exist these days,
except to note that electricity and clean water can be in short
supply. Murphy concentrates instead on a collusion between migrant
families and farmers to skirt the law.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers need the low-paid seasonal workers to bring in their
crops for a profit; the families need the muscle power of every
member, even an 11-year-old, to earn enough to keep the van running
and everybody eating. ``I have to help my dad,'' says James. When
the blueberry crop fails in Michigan, the wage goes down to $2.35
an hour.
</P>
<P>
   As for the big food processors like Heinz, which buys the
cucumbers that the Flores clan picks in Ohio, they declare their
abidance to the law against employing minors (``We just won't
tolerate it'') but don't seem to go to excessive exertions to
enforce it. The report suggests that the prevailing rule in
American agriculture is, ``Don't ask, don't tell.''
</P>
<P>
   One farmer, who runs into trouble when James is discovered
working his pickle farm is shamefaced about his reliance on workers
whom he can't afford to pay a decent wage. But another makes the
vehement case that James is better off working the fields along
with his close-knit family than in a broken home. A sorry choice,
yet the evidence of family unity adds a softening touch to their
harsh odyssey.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, James manages to get some schooling, but next
season he'll be 12 and so permitted to work legally. The hour is a
painful look at the migrant-worker condition and at an engaging,
dutiful, plucky boy who seems on his way to giving up what chance
he may have to get through high school in an effort to help his
family get through a hard life.

GREENPEACE ACCUSES MEXICAN OIL FIRM OF POLLUTING GULF AREA 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ In a complaint filed Wednesday, the environmental
group Greenpeace accused the state-owned petroleum company of
violating conservation laws by dumping vast amounts of toxic waste
into scores of illegal sites in swamps and forests on the Gulf
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Greenpeace officials said they had documented similar abuses by
the company, Petroleos Mexicanos, known as Pemex, in hundreds of
communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pemex is the main environmental criminal in Mexico, no doubt
about it,'' a Greenpeace director, Alejandro Calvillo, said at a
news conference here.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed after a campaign by schoolchildren,
homemakers and politicians forced Texas to halt construction of a
nuclear waste site across the border near El Paso. Now
environmentalists and journalists have begun focusing on the
hazards posed at home by illegal toxic-waste sites across Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Greenpeace traced the complaint filed Wednesday from an incident
in August, when villagers in Ixhuatlan del Sureste in Veracruz
state on the Gulf Coast surprised Pemex workers as they were
emptying 55-gallon drums of toxic petroleum waste off a flatbed
truck into a marsh, Calvillo said.
</P>
<P>
   The workers acknowledged that they had carried 200 barrels of
waste from a Pemex refinery to the same site over several days, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists have identified 60 similar sites where Pemex
has been illegally discharging petroleum wastes in that area,
Calvillo said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the company, Fernando Martinez, said Pemex had
no comment on the suit. ``I've investigated, and there's no
official attitude one way or the other on this,'' Martinez said.
``It's company policy not to respond until we get formal
notification.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Mexican environmental law federal prosecutors will
study Greenpeace's complaint before deciding whether to press
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Baumgarten, a lawyer with the Mexican Center for
Environmental Law who prepared the Greenpeace papers, said Pemex
officials, if found guilty, could face fines totaling $70,000 or
prison terms from three months to six years.
</P>
<P>
   Pemex executives and the monopoly, which provides as much as
one-third of Mexico's tax revenues and is one of the country's most
powerful institutions, have rarely been punished for environmental
practices, Baumgarten said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They commit environmental crimes that are only rarely reported
and for which they are almost never charged,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Accusations of environmental irresponsibility are not new to
Pemex. In 1992 gasoline that had leaked from a poorly maintained
Pemex pipeline in the sewers of Guadalajara exploded, killing at
least 190 people and injuring 1,500.

COURT APPROVES SUIT BY SON IN NOTORIOUS MURDER CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: SUBS lead to clarify, ADDS sentence to 2nd graf with summary
of court's reasoning; CORRECTS spelling of Sheppard in 6th graf;
minor editing changes elsewhere.)  (mk) 
 By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than four decades after Dr. Sam Sheppard was convicted of
murdering his wife in a case that transfixed America, the Ohio
Supreme Court cleared the way Wednesday for his son to try to prove
Sheppard's innocence and to sue the state of Ohio for wrongfully
imprisoning him.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio's highest court ruled, 4-3, against a request by the
Cuyahoga County prosecutor to stop the suit by the son, Sam Reese
Sheppard, from going to trial. The court majority held that there
were issues that could be decided by the trial judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm heartened we're getting our day in court, and I'm
surprised, because I didn't think the Supreme Court would have the
will to do this,'' said Sheppard, who lives in Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Sheppard was 7 years old in 1954 when his father was found
guilty of fatally bludgeoning his wife, Marilyn, in their lakeside
home in suburban Cleveland, and was sentenced to life in prison.
Ten years later Sheppard's conviction was overturned by the U.S.
Supreme Court on the ground that the news media had turned the
trial into a carnival, and in a second trial Sheppard was found not
guilty.
</P>
<P>
   But the son believed that justice had not been done, and
embarked on an investigation that has now found DNA evidence
exonerating his father and pointing to a window washer at the
Sheppard home as the murderer.
</P>
<P>
   The Sheppard case &UR;  &LR; entered popular culture by forming the basis
for the television series ``The Fugitive'' and the movie of the
same name.
 &UR;  &LR; On the night of the murder, Dr. Sheppard claimed that he was
sleeping downstairs in the family's home on Lake Erie in suburban
Cleveland when he heard his wife scream, and he ran up the stairs
to her bedroom. He said he saw a ``bushy-haired'' man and began
struggling with him until the intruder knocked him out.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors always dismissed his defense, and the case has
continued to polarize Cleveland. Stephanie Tubbs Jones, the
prosecutor in Cleveland who tried to block the wrongful
imprisonment trial, issued a statement Wednesday saying she would
``ask the Supreme Court to reconsider its decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones, a Democrat who was elected to Congress last month,
will leave the prosecutor's office in January, but she has taken
what some lawyers, politicians and journalists in Cleveland see as
a tough, personal stance against Sheppard and his efforts to clear
his father.
</P>
<P>
   As an indication of how politically sensitive the Sheppard case
remains, one of the three dissenting justices on the Ohio Supreme
Court, Francis Sweeney, was an assistant prosecutor in Sheppard's
second trial. He refused to recuse himself.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Gilbert, the lawyer for Sheppard, said he would be happy
``to sit down and discuss a settlement in a civil way'' with the
prosecutor's office. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``This case has been a painful legacy for Cleveland,'' Gilbert
said, ``and it's time that the community resolve the tragedy and
acknowledge that Sam Sheppard was wrongfully imprisoned and that
this had consequences for him, his family and our system of
justice,'' Gilbert said.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert said he did not expect the trial for a declaration of
innocence and wrongful imprisonment to begin before next summer,
given the complexity of the case. If Sheppard was found to be
wrongfully imprisoned, under Ohio law his son could then bring a
suit for damages in the state Court of Claims.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert said he and Sheppard had not yet discussed what amount
of damages they would seek. By law, the state would be liable for
$25,000 for each of the 10 years that Sheppard served in prison,
plus lawyers fees and any loss of earnings, which could be
considerable, given that he had had a large medical practice.
</P>
<P>
   Among the evidence Gilbert plans to introduce will be DNA
evidence taken from the exhumed body of Sheppard and wood chips
with blood smears taken by police from the Sheppards' house after
the murder. The evidence was examined by Mohammad Tahir, a
supervisor of DNA and serology at the Indianapolis-Marion County
Forensic Services Agency.
</P>
<P>
   According to Tahir, the samples show that the blood did not come
from either Sheppard or his wife; therefore, there must have been a
third person present at the murder. That person, Tahir said, was
the window washer, Richard Eberling, whose DNA was obtained after a
court order as part of Sheppard's lawsuit. Eberling, who had been
convicted of another murder, died in prison last July.

MANDELA GAINS IN COURT BATTLE OVER RUGBY INVESTIGATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Awarding a round to President
Nelson Mandela in his battle with South Africa's former rugby
hierarchy, the country's highest court unanimously agreed Wednesday
to hear his appeal of a lower court ruling against him.
</P>
<P>
   In so doing, the court, which was created by the 1994
constitution, demonstrated again that it does not intend to sit
back while lower courts dominated by apartheid-era judges take up
important issues. Instead, the court, called the Constitutional
Court, seems to be pursuing potential landmark cases to rule on
them quickly.
</P>
<P>
   In April, a Pretoria judge ruled that Mandela had acted
unconstitutionally in appointing a commission to look into charges
that the administration of rugby was corrupt and nepotistic.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, Judge William de Villiers ordered Mandela to
take the witness stand, where he was cross-examined for two days
about whether he had ``applied his mind'' before appointing the
Browde Commission of Inquiry, or whether he had simply
rubber-stamped a recommendation of his minister of sport.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time a South African president had been called
to testify in court. The case raises constitutional issues about a
judge's powers to compel presidential testimony, and about how
deeply the courts can inquire into decision-making in the executive
branch.
</P>
<P>
   After ordering that the inquiry commission not meet, de Villiers
astonished many lawyers and other justice officials by waiting
months before issuing an 1,159-page explanation of his ruling.
Among other things, it questioned Mandela's credibility and
behavior on the stand.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying case is about the control of rugby, one of the
three sports _ along with soccer and cricket _ that South Africans
care passionately about. Rugby is still popular largely with
whites, especially with Afrikaners.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said the South African Rugby Football Union, which
influences every level of the game from high school up to the
Springbok national team, had failed to bring black players along
and was dominated by Louis Luyt, who controlled important teams and
stadiums. A committee of the rugby union said accusations of racism
were ``defamatory, inflammatory and devoid of all substance.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandela, at the urging of his sports minister, Steve Tshwete,
appointed a commission headed by Jules Browde, a prominent human
rights lawyer, to investigate. Luyt sued to stop him.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment of Mandela by Luyt's legal team infuriated many
South Africans. The National Sports Council called for a world
boycott of South African rugby and trade unions threatened to
disrupt games. Luyt was forced to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Luyt, a former fertilizer and brewery magnate who acted as a
front man for apartheid government efforts to bankrupt the liberal
English-language press 20 years ago, has become something of a hero
to Afrikaner nationalists. He recently formed his own political
party for the 1999 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the Constitutional Court, its president, Judge
Arthur Chaskalson, rejected the contention by Luyt's lawyers that
the appeal was more about facts than constitutional law and that it
should be heard by the former high court, the Supreme Court of
Appeals in Bloemfontein. The Constitutional Court will hear the
appeal beginning March 23.

ECONOMIC SCENE: STUDY CUTS THROUGH BLATHER ON SOCIAL SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Clinton administration begins a two-day conference next
week at the White House on fixing Social Security, the most radical
option on the table, and the darling of Republicans, will be the
one that would allow individuals to deposit part of their payroll
taxes into private retirement accounts rather than into the
existing government fund.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, supporters say, is to give individuals more control
over their financial futures and to reap the large returns that are
possible once they can invest in stocks and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The issues are complex, but conference participants might cut
through the usual blather if they first read a lucid study,
released last week, by an expert panel of the National Academy of
Social Insurance, a nonpartisan research group. Its chairman is
Professor Peter Diamond of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, about evenly divided between supporters and critics,
was assigned the task of clarifying the pros and cons of
privatization, not choosing sides. And clarify it did. The report
resolves most of the financial issues and exposes the political
issues that cannot be settled by technical analysis. Indeed, it was
largely disagreement over the treatment of the political trade-offs
that prompted three panel members to resign before the final draft
was written.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis suggests one sweeping generality: there is no
financial goal that private accounts can achieve that cannot be
achieved at lower administrative costs by a government system that
can invest in private stocks and bonds. There are plausible
arguments for private accounts, but they are political. If the
report does nothing more than prove this point _ that privatization
is a political, not a financial, fix _ then it will move the debate
away from the posturing that advertises privatization as a
financial cure for a bankrupt system.
</P>
<P>
   The panel did not concern itself with plugging the gap between
Social Security's revenue and outlays that will widen early in the
next century. The plausible solutions _ a combination of modest tax
increases and benefit cuts _ are well known. Some supporters of
private accounts contend they can help balance Social Security's
books by investing in stocks and bonds. Private accounts should
generate returns of, say, 5 percent a year above inflation. By
contrast, the return on money deposited into the government fund
hovers below 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the panel cites a paper by three of its members proving that
the high return on private accounts is an optical illusion. The
government ran up trillions of dollars of debt by paying benefits
to earlier retirees far beyond what they paid into the system. If
private accounts were taxed to bear a fair share of this debt
burden, their gaudy return would, as a matter of arithmetic, fall
to the level of the government fund.
</P>
<P>
   The panel walks the reader through three crucial issues.
</P>
<P>
   Should taxpayers be forced to save more for retirement? Yes, the
panel says, because the personal savings rate is puny and the best
way to generate income in the future is to save and invest more
today.
</P>
<P>
   Should Social Security payroll taxes be invested in stocks?
Again, the panel says yes. The current government fund invests only
in Treasury bonds. Wealthy Americans need not care, because they
can mitigate this bonds-only strategy by investing private savings
in stocks. But most families have virtually no savings. The only
way for them to tap the high returns on stock is for Social
Security to invest for them.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the panel asks, should stock investments be made by a
government fund on behalf of everyone or by individuals on their
own behalf. Here the panel was split.
</P>
<P>
   A government fund _ identical to today's system, though
partially invested in stocks _ would earn higher returns but at a
fraction of the cost of setting up 150 million separate accounts.
It would also preserve the collective security of today's system,
where retirement checks are tied to an individual's lifelong record
of earnings rather than the vagaries of stock and bond prices.
</P>
<P>
   The danger is political. The government would indirectly own
huge parts of U.S. companies, with the potential of political
manipulation. Would Congress allow a government fund to buy, say,
shares of tobacco companies or of companies that are unfriendly to
unions?
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of private accounts, supporters say, is that they
give people autonomy to tailor their investments and the assurance
that comes with ownership. Also, workers who own retirement
accounts might be more willing to add to them by saving more.
Another virtue, again political, is that Congress might be loath to
tamper.
</P>
<P>
   But critics point to their high administrative cost _ perhaps 20
percent or more of the accumulated value _ and the numbing
complexity.
</P>
<P>
   Besides financial risk, there are also political risks. Would
Congress let ill or otherwise desperate workers invade their
accounts early, exposing spouses to financial harm? Would Congress
ride to the rescue of retirees who make lousy investment decisions,
thereby encouraging everyone else to gamble? And would a system
that relies on accumulating savings from lifelong earnings
victimize widows, orphans and the disabled?
</P>
<P>
   The report sweeps away the financial underbrush to the debate
and highlights political trade-offs. Congress might decide that
autonomy trumps collective security. But idle chatter about
financial emergency should not be allowed to camouflage naked
politics.

BOSNIAN SERB GENERAL ARRESTED ON GENOCIDE CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ American and allied forces in Bosnia on Wednesday
arrested a Bosnian Serb general who was charged with genocide by
the international war crimes tribunal in a recent secret
indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Radislav Krstic, arrested without incident in the
American sector in northeast Bosnia, is the highest-ranking
official to be seized so far, and the first serving military
officer. He is accused of directing the attack on Srebrenica in
1995, one of the most chilling and influential events of the
Bosnian war, when some 7,000 Bosnian Muslim men were marched off,
presumably to their deaths, as U.N. peacekeepers stood by.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment of Krstic accuses him of having committed
genocide during and after the fall of Srebrenica between July 11
and Nov. 1, 1995. He is indicted both in connection with ``direct
personal involvement in the commission of these crimes'' as well as
his command responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   He is also accused of murder and other crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Krstic was a colonel in 1995, and the deputy commander of the
Drina battalion, but was promoted to general within days of the
fall of Srebrenica. He is considered a close associate of the
Bosnian Serb commander, Gen. Ratko Mladic, and the former Bosnian
Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, both of whom are wanted by the
tribunal. And he is considered capable, if he is willing to
testify, of implicating Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, who
has not been indicted.
</P>
<P>
   Louise Arbour, chief prosecutor of the International Criminal
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, called Krstic ``a very
significant military leader'' and said she was delighted with the
arrest. The general was only indicted on Oct. 30, tribunal
officials said, but the indictment was kept secret so there would
be a better chance of a successful arrest.
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana warned that other war
crimes suspects still at large ``should realize that they, too,
will be brought to justice.''
</P>
<P>
   James Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said that the
arrest ``serves as a standing warning to those indicted for war
crimes, who remain at large, that they will be held individually
accountable for their actions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bosnian Serbs reacted angrily to the arrest, with the
hardline Bosnian Serb president, Nikola Poplasen, saying that his
government would now reduce contacts with NATO-led peacekeeping
forces ``to the necessary minimum.''
</P>
<P>
   Poplasen, who defeated a more moderate candidate backed by
Washington in September elections, said the arrest of Krstic had
``embittered and upset'' the Bosnian Serbs and would harm the
implementation of the Dayton agreement that ended the 1992-1995
Bosnian war. He said he would protest the arrest, and his remarks
were later endorsed by parliament in a majority vote.
</P>
<P>
   A senior official of a NATO country called the arrest ``very
good news'' and said it was ``a warning to Milosevic himself'' and
others who have not been publicly indicted that ``the murders
committed have not been forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon official said the arrest, the most important made in
the American sector, ``was a sign that this is a continuing
process.'' NATO-led peacekeeping troops have now arrested nine
people wanted for war crimes in the former Yugoslavia, four of whom
were the subject of sealed indictments.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There have been numerous calls for the arrest of Mladic and
Karadzic, the two most infamous men indicted, but they normally are
accompanied by armed guards. NATO forces have never tried to arrest
them, apparently fearing casualties and an angry public reaction
from Bosnian Serbs. Officials say that both Mladic and Karadzic are
believed to have left the Bosnian Serb Republic to live in Serbia,
which is part of Yugoslavia and controlled by Milosvevic. Krstic,
who was transferred to The Hague for trial, is the 35th suspect who
has been taken there and the 26th person currently being held
there.
</P>
<P>
   He is the commander of the Bosnian Serb 5th Corps and was
arrested while traveling on the road to Bijelina.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset of the war in 1992, he was an officer of the
Yugoslav Army, and like all senior Bosnian Serb officers, was
transferred to the new Bosnian Serb force. In 1994, he lost a leg
in a mine explosion.
</P>
<P>
   One Bosnian Serb official said in a telephone interview that, at
the time, Krstic had responsibility for ``anti-terrorist units''
who were given some of the most difficult tasks. ``Srebrenica is a
dark part of our history and people don't talk about it,'' the
official said. ``But everyone believes it was the anti-terrorist
units that were sent to do the killing.''
</P>
<P>
   In Banja Luka on Wednesday, some members of the Bosnian Serb
parliament protested the arrest, saying that Krstic was simply
doing his job as a soldier.
</P>
<P>
   Ivo Daalder, a former Bosnia expert on the National Security
Council, now with the Brookings Institution, said the arrest showed
a new and promising coordination between the Tribunal and NATO
troops, given the rapid arrest after the Oct. 30 indictment.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that the arrest of a serving officer for an
important war crime would send an important message.
</P>
<P>
   Srebrenica was a key town in the Bosnian conflict. It was where
the United Nations first made a stand in March 1993, when the
commander of U.N. troops personally led a convoy of trucks to the
surrounded town and promised the Bosnian Muslims there that
Srebrenica would be a ``safe area'' and the United Nations would
protect them.
</P>
<P>
   But in July 1995, the United Nations did not protect Srebrenica
with air strikes, and peacekeeping troops watched as the Serbs
marched in, separated Muslim men and women and marched the men off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Srebrenica signaled the massive failure of the West,'' said
Daalder. ``It galvanized the United States and NATO to act.'' At a
London conference later in July, NATO agreed to defend Gorazde and
remaining safe areas with massive air strikes if necessary. After a
mortar attack on the Sarajevo marketplace in late August, NATO air
strikes began, signaling the last chapter of the war and leading to
the American-brokered Dayton Accords.
</P>
<P>
   In Sarajevo Wednesday, an aide to the Bosnian Muslim member of
the collective presidency, Alija Izetbegovic, praised the arrest.
``We welcome this action, hoping very soon that the time will come
for Karadzic and Mladic to be brought to justice,'' said the aide,
Mirza Jajric.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest took place as foreign ministers of the member
countries of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe met in Oslo, Norway, to discuss the international effort to
keep the peace in Kosovo, the southern Serbian province. Under a
deal pressed on Milosevic in October, the organization will provide
up to 2,000 civilians to monitor a cease-fire in Kosovo and to
promote a political settlement there to give Kosovo enhanced
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia's government Wednesday formally approved the basing of
1,700 NATO troops near its border with Kosovo. Those troops will be
prepared to rush to the aid of the civilian monitors if necessary.

COLORADO RESORTS GET AN INTERNATIONAL ACCENT  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 6)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VAIL, Colo. _ Deep in the nation's heartland, the Colorado
Rockies are 1,000 miles from the nearest seaport. But jet travel,
satellite television and foreign-language Web sites are quickly
integrating America's most popular skiing state into the world
tourism economy.
</P>
<P>
   This winter, foreign skiers are expected to buy 10 percent of
lift tickets at Colorado ski areas, triple their share of a decade
ago. Last winter at Vail and Breckenridge, the nation's two busiest
ski areas, foreign skiers bought about 15 percent of tickets sold.
At Aspen, the most international of Colorado's resorts, foreigners
accounted for 21 percent of ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   The number of lift tickets sold to Americans has been more or
less flat for the last decade, so Colorado resorts believe their
biggest future growth will be international. This winter, the
foreign invasion will be fueled by two new factors.
</P>
<P>
   In September, British Airways inaugurated a daily nonstop flight
between Gatwick Airport outside London and Denver International
Airport. This restored a trans-Atlantic link that was lost five
years ago when Continental dropped the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, Britain was our third biggest market, after
Colorado and Texas,'' said Jim Felton, spokesman for Breckenridge,
a resort that sold 1.3 million lift tickets over all last winter.
``The British Airways flight should keep that momentum going.''
</P>
<P>
   Vail's international visibility should grow in February, when
the resort and Beaver Creek will host the 1999 World Alpine Ski
Championships. In 1989, the last time Vail had that honor, the
television audience outside the United States was estimated at 300
million people. This winter, with the spread of cable and satellite
TV through Eastern Europe, Asia and Latin America, the foreign
audience is expected to be 500 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 1989 championships truly put the Vail valley on the
international map,'' said John Dakin, spokesman for the nonprofit
Vail Valley Foundation, which is organizing the races. ``In 1989,
Europe was having a snow drought. European viewers were seeing
their correspondents standing waist deep in Vail's snow and saying
the men's alpine had been canceled because of too much snow.''
</P>
<P>
   This winter, the races will be held from Jan. 30 through Feb.
14. ``Vail is going to become one giant TV studio, constantly
selling how great the skiing is here,'' said Bruce Mainzer, head of
marketing for Vail Resorts, which owns Vail, Breckenridge, Beaver
Creek and Keystone ski areas.
</P>
<P>
   The arson fires atop Vail in October, claimed by
environmentalists angry over Vail's addition of new ski trails, are
not expected to have much impact on foreign visits this winter,
said John Frew, president of Colorado Ski Country USA, a trade
group. Three buildings were destroyed and four chairlifts damaged;
the lifts are expected to reopen by January.
</P>
<P>
   ``The facts seem to have come through fairly accurately, people
seem to realize that the Vail experience has not been impacted,''
Frew said in a telephone interview from London, where he was the
host for ski-promotion events at a travel trade fair. ``Out of 500
questions I answered, two were about the Vail fires.'' He added
that he had not heard of any cancellations because of the fires.
</P>
<P>
   Frew, who was on his third promotional trip to London this year,
said that economics are dictating Colorado's pursuit of the foreign
skier. His research indicates that foreign skiers stay longer and
spend more than American skiers: The average skier from the Denver
area spends $49 a day, the average out-of-state skier spends $150 a
day, and the average foreign skier spends $300 a day.
</P>
<P>
   While Aspen aims to sell one quarter of its tickets to
foreigners by the year 2000, marketers at Colorado's lesser-known
ski areas have also caught the foreign bug. Copper Mountain has
reservationists that speak Japanese, German and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Skiers in Australia, Britain, Germany, the Netherlands, Japan,
Mexico and New Zealand can now call a toll-free international
number and speak in their own language to a reservationist at the
Rocky Mountain resort. Silver Creek, a small Brazilian-owned
resort, has hired an international marketing manager and is
organizing ski trips from Brazilian cities such as Brasilia and
Belo Horizonte.
</P>
<P>
   Itiro Takahashi, the marketing director and one of 20 Brazilians
who will work at Silver Creek this winter, said: ``We are promoting
easy slopes, a resort where no one gets lost, the possibility of
shopping trips on the side.''
</P>
<P>
   Skiers from Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires tend to
go to Aspen, while skiers from Mexico tend to favor Vail. To cater
to this market, Elena Campa is publishing this month a 64-page
Spanish-language guide to Vail and a 48-page guide in Spanish and
Portuguese to Aspen.
</P>
<P>
   On her bilingual Spanish-Portuguese Web site for Latins planning
Colorado ski vacations, www.andandocolorado.com, ``we are averaging
6,000 hits a month,'' Ms. Campa said. With traffic heavy to
advertisers through the site's links, she said that many Vail and
Aspen companies are now having their own Web sites translated into
Spanish.

JEWISH GROUP ACCUSES FRENCH OF HIDING STOLEN-ART RECORDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WALTER V. ROBINSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Facing an apprehensive audience, the World Jewish
Congress startled a private session of a 44-nation international
conference on Holocaust assets by saying it has already identified
1,700 artworks in 225 museums worldwide that it suspects may have
been looted by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Lauder, the chairman of the Congress' Committee on Art
Recovery, also accused the French government at the Tuesday session
of hiding records that would reveal the identities of Jews whose
looted artworks French museums now display. Lauder's charges were
disclosed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   And Wednesday, on the second day of the three-day conference,
British Lord Greville Janner raised an issue that the US hosts had
deliberately kept off the agenda because of its controversial
nature: slave labor.
</P>
<P>
   Janner, the chairman of Britain's Holocaust Education Trust,
cited 11 major companies, including Ford Motor Co.'s European
subsidiaries, and Daimler Benz, which just merged with Chrysler, as
having used slave labor from Nazi concentration camps during the
war.
</P>
<P>
   Ori Z. Soltes, chairman of the Holocaust Art Restitution Project
and a panelist Wednesday, scolded the conference organizers for
talking about the rights of art claimants, but refusing to invite
victims of looting or listen to their concerns, according to an
account provided to the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   The hopes of the US hosts, that the conference would be
relatively free of rancor, appear to have been dashed, leaving in
doubt whether the State Department can win consensus on a fairly
mild, non-binding agreement for the 44 countries to open their
archives and seek to match claimants with artworks that have been
missing for more than a half century.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal does not even call for the return of looted art,
only that ``steps be taken immediately to achieve a just and fair
solution.''
</P>
<P>
   When Secretary of State Madeleine Albright formally opened the
international conference on Holocaust assets on Tuesday, she urged
the delegates to ``work together constructively in an atmosphere
free from threats.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Dubrow, a State Department spokesman, said last night
that ``the discussions could certainly be described as frank. But
that shouldn't be a surprise, given that these are such important
and long-festering issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Dubrow, who said there was no expectation that the conferees
would gather ``just to pat one another on the back,'' said he
believes there is positive forward movement on the US proposal on
looted art, though he said there is not yet consensus.
</P>
<P>
   Though Albright said in her welcoming remarks that the
conference ``requires that painful memories be revisited, easy
evasions confronted, and inconvenient questions asked and
answered,'' The US hosts had given every other indication possible
that they wanted to avoid confrontation of any sort.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, art investigator Willi Korte said the Americans
miscalculated how divisive such issues are in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is not pursuing any substantial claims
against other countries, nor are there any claims against the
United States,'' Korte said in an interview. ``They do not realize
how difficult, controversial and complex these issues are in
Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   To insure comity, some critics have charged that the State
Department pruned from the list of speakers some experts they
thought would be controversial, though State Department officials
have denied doing so.
</P>
<P>
   One expert who was told she would be included as a panelist,
only to have her name dropped, was Patricia Kennedy Grimsted, an
associate at the Ukrainian Research Institute at Harvard and one of
the world's leading experts on the restitution of historical and
government records.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole subject is controversial,'' she said, Russia's
refusal to return to European countries the important archival
records that Soviet troops took home from Germany after World War
II. Germany had looted the archives from Occupied Europe during the
war.
</P>
<P>
   When she was in Amsterdam last week, Grimsted discovered she had
not only been dropped from the panel on archival restitution, but
that she could not even get a pass to attend the conference. She
will give a seminar on her research this Friday at the National
Archives.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a complicated story and a complicated issue,''
Grimsted said of the archives in Russian possession. ``Yet the
people in Washington want to make it all very simple. They want
everything settled by the year 2000, and that's very unrealistic.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Washington conference, while expressing
gratitude for Grimsted's role at planning sessions for the
conference, said she was deemed ``too subject specific'' in her
expertise, since the US hosts chose not to focus attention on any
specfic country.
</P>
<P>
   Lauder, who is overseeing a World Jewish Congress art
restitution effort that was begun several months ago, said his
researchers have already been through catalogues of the holdings of
225 museums, looking at ownership information that might raise
suspicions that the works were plundered by the Nazis and not
restituted after the war.
</P>
<P>
   Lauder did not identify the museums or the countries, but art
specialists said Wednesday that they expect that not many of the
artworks are in US museums.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Janner, who angered the US hosts on Tuesday when he
suggested in a luncheon speech to the conference that a follow-up
session he held a year from now, held a news conference Wednesday
to raise the slave labor issue.
</P>
<P>
   Janner said the issue has implications even for the United
States, and that substantial compensation may be required. He said
the Holocaust Education Trust, which he heads, recently completed a
report showing that about one million of the six million Jews
killed in the Holocaust died from slave labor. An additional 7.7
million non-Jews were employed as slave laborers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Ford was sued as part of a class action suit
seeking compensation for its subsidiaries' use of slave labor.
Janner said that in addition to Ford and Daimler-Benz, other major
companies that used slave labor include BMW, Volkswagen, Krupp,
Siemens and Knorr.
</P>
<P>
   So sensitive was the State Department to the slave labor issue
that they had even dissuaded the National Archives from holding a
seminar on how to research slave labor records. And the substantive
discussions on how to deal with thorny issues of restitution have
all been held in private.

   ATLANTA _ After nearly 900 hours spent being cooped up in
Volkswagens, the Star 94 ``Live in It and Win It'' contestants
finally rode into the sunset Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after noon, with a crowd of spectators and TV crews
looking on, Kevin Danley, David Stephenson, John Crow and Sonja
Banks exited the red 1998 VW Beetle at North Point Mall in
Alpharetta(Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   The radio station had halted the contest with four participants
remaining, even though there were only two Beetles to award. So
each contestant was handed an envelope containing a slip of paper.
</P>
<P>
   Result: Banks snared the much-coveted black VW, and Crow won the
red model. Stephenson and Danley got one-year leases of black and
yellow Beetles _ which arrived for the occasion, honking their way
through the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Former contestants Brenda Burke and Jennifer Roller also showed
up to congratulate the winners.
</P>
<P>
   The winning foursome plans to go to dinner and a movie next
week. There's even a one-year reunion on the schedule. Quipped
Banks: ``We're going to spend two days together in one of the cars
so we can catch up.''

<P>
   EVERETT, Wash. _ For all the talk of Microsoft exercising global
dominance from the empire's capital here in the Seattle area, most
residents know that the big engine for jobs in the region remains
Boeing Co., the nation's largest exporter, whose 100,000-strong
local work force is eight times the size of Microsoft's.
</P>
<P>
   The airplane behemoth is the region's biggest employer,
providing good jobs for tens of thousands of blue-collar workers,
whose strong union has secured the kinds of wages that enable many
workers to afford fishing boats and second homes in the Pacific
Northwest mountains.
</P>
<P>
   So when the company announced Tuesday that it was cutting 20
percent of its worldwide work force over the next two years _
20,000 jobs in addition to the 28,000 it had announced in July _
with many of those cuts planned for the Seattle area, the news hit
like a chill winter wind.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, one of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow Jones
industrial average, fell 16.7 percent, or $6.6875, to $33.6875
Wednesday in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The Dow was
down 69 points for the day.
</P>
<P>
   The chief factor cited by Boeing for the company's downturn, the
Asian recession, continues to hammer at the local economy in other
ways as well: exports of all non-aircraft products from this
heavily trade-dependent state are down more than 30 percent in the
last year, state economists say. And while exporters here see signs
that Asia's problems may be easing, those projections seem to
provide little consolation for Boeing workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see any quick turnaround,'' said Thomas Plummer, 49,
an aircraft test technician on the production line for the 747
jumbo jet, as he finished the graveyard shift early Wednesday
morning. ``I mean, even if things get better over there, I can't
see Asian airlines rushing out and saying, `Hey, let's buy a lot of
big planes to celebrate.' You're talking $180 million or so for a
fully loaded 747. That's a serious chunk of change.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Moe, 35, a wing mechanic who was laid off for four years
in the early 1990s and fears a similar fate now, agreed. ``You've
got to think, how many planes do we already have sitting in the
desert with no customers,'' he said, referring to a collection of
sparkling new wide-bodied jets that are indeed parked there because
various airlines, most from Asia, have not been able to pay for
their orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd like to think there was something you could do, work
harder, whatever'' to stem the company's problems, he added. ``But
what can you do? It's out of your hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The job cuts represent a potentially serious blow to the
region's economy, especially because the rough rule of thumb is
that every job at Boeing creates about three other jobs, directly,
in related businesses like suppliers, or indirectly, in stores and
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   No one here seems to think that things will be anywhere near as
dire as the 1970s, when the company cut nearly two-thirds of its
work force amid a global recession and a notorious sign directed
the last person leaving Seattle to turn off all the lights. But
they are a worrying sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the last Boeing slump, in '91-93, the state
economy held up pretty well, because of other areas, obviously the
high-tech area, but also timber and agriculture as well,'' said
Charles Hill, a professor at the University of Washington's school
of business administration. ``The problem now, of course, is that
timber and agriculture are Asian-dependent. Go figure. I think
it'll hurt us.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill and others noted that the Boeing announcement seemed almost
strangely late. ``I'm not surprised, I'm surprised that people are
surprised,'' he said. ``I think this has been in the cards for 12
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moment those economies hit the skids,'' he said, referring
to Asia, ``this was in the cards.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Whitlow, an analyst with Safeco Asset Management who
follows Boeing and who serves on Gov. Gary Locke's Council of
Economic Advisers, said the company ``seems to be the last one to
figure out how bad it would be'' in Asia. Even with the signs that
the economies are bouncing back, he said, there is no short-term
good news for Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it just takes time,'' said Whitlow. ``It will be three
or four years before you see much of an improvement in deliveries
to Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone here thinks that all of Boeing's problems can be
traced to Asia. In Wednesday's edition of the online magazine
Slate, published by Microsoft, James Surowiecki wrote: ``While in
part these cutbacks represent an aggressive response to a sharp
falloff in demand from Asia, they're also the result of a failure
of management _ production line inefficiencies, mismanaged capacity
and poor forecasting. Boeing needs a new approach, and job-cutting
alone isn't it.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing officials said Wednesday that they had renegotiated many
contracts with major suppliers and were taking other cost-saving
measures, which they portrayed as helping to ease the problems
caused by the fall-off in Asian demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things that we can't control, like the Asian
crisis,'' said Bob Jorgensen, a Boeing spokesman. ``We work on
things we can control, and because of those savings those cuts
won't be as deep.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some of the unionized workers coming off their shift early
Wednesday morning also said they were suspicious that the cutbacks
represent a bargaining threat for the upcoming battle between the
company and the aerospace workers union over a new contract. The
current one is scheduled to expire next September.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, when the current contract was ratified after a
69-day strike, workers claimed a major victory for organized labor,
including wage increases of about 10 percent and protection of many
health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The bitterness over the negotiations quickly subsided, as the
nation and the company enjoyed a huge economic boom. Amid a surge
in demand for Boeing planes, the company made big payments for
overtime work, hired more workers (21,000 people in 1996 and 17,000
last year), and pleaded with some retirees to come back to the
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, the fear is that the boom times are over. And
while no specific individuals have yet received layoff notices,
everyone knows they're coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``You live in this bubble, waiting for the news,'' said Rolf
Vitous, 34, an electrical systems installer who has been with the
company for two and a half years. ``You don't go out and buy a new
car, you don't buy a lot of Christmas presents, you definitely
don't go and buy a new house. You lie in the bubble and wait. ``
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has jobs in more than half the states in the country,
including about 42,000 in southern California, making it one of the
largest single private employers in that region. But its presence
in Seattle and its environs is huge, and because this is the
production site for most of the wide-bodied jets for which Asian
airlines have reduced orders, everyone knows there will be
significant job cutbacks here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a boom-and-bust business, and Boeing people understand
the cyclical nature of it,'' said Plummer, the test technician.
``But that doesn't help when you go home and your spouse says,
`Honey, are you going to have a job tomorrow?' ''
</P>

MARKET JARRED BY BOEING AND SEARS EARNINGS FORECASTS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks weakened Wednesday after Boeing and Sears,
Roebuck warned of lower 1999 profits, but all major averages
rebounded smartly during the afternoon to finish with losses well
under 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was pressure coming in, only to be met by strong
institutional demand,'' said Joseph Battipaglia, investment policy
chairman at Gruntal &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   He said some of this buying reflected ``window dressing'' by
portfolio managers eager to be seen holding winners in year-end
statements.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's disclosure late Tuesday that it expected profits to be
as much as 25 percent less than the company projected in July sent
its shares plunging 6 11/16, to 33 11/16, accounting for 40 percent
of the loss in the Dow Jones industrial average.
</P>
<P>
   The blue-chip gauge closed 69 points lower after having skidded
more than 178 points at midday.
</P>
<P>
   But the aircraft maker's swoon, which also prompted selling in
United Technologies, down 4 13/16, to 101|, and other of its
suppliers, was said to be more a reflection of disappointment with
Boeing's erratic response to Asian economic problems than to fears
that Asian orders will shrink further.
</P>
<P>
   As for Sears, which now predicts an earnings rise of 1 percent
to 3 percent instead of the 5.2 percent that Wall Street expected,
fell 1 9/16, to 43, as most department stores and discounters lost
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Although most Internet stocks and other speculative favorites
lost ground, buyers gave the latest initial public offering a warm
reception. E-Tek Dynamics offered 5 million shares at 12 and the
fiber optics company traded as high as 29~ before closing at 26}.
</P>
<P>
   The recent frenzied buying of almost every company with an
Internet tie brought a strong expression of concern from John
Laporte, a specialist in small-capitalization companies at T. Rowe
Price.
</P>
<P>
   ``It clearly represents a speculative bubble,'' not unlike tulip
mania centuries ago in the Netherlands, he told an investment
seminar in New York. ``I think it's quite worrisome.''
</P>
<P>
   A report of stepped-up insider selling at Excite and other
Internet companies apparently dampened enthusiasm Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Another sign that the market may be growing less exuberant,
observed Richard Cripps, chief strategist at Legg Mason, is a
survey showing less bullishness among Wall Street traders. The
latest reading found 60 percent optimistic, down from 78 percent
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon, which said it retained the ability to call off its
acquisition of Mobil if demands of antitrust enforcers were judged
too onerous, eased ], to 71\.
</P>
<P>
   Drug stocks were among the afternoon's recovery pacesetters.
Schering-Plough gained 4], Bristol-Myers 3 7/16, Pfizer 2 1/16 and
Merck, American Home Products and Abbott a point or more each.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Citigroup will begin trading under the ticker symbol C,
the designation for Chrysler before the automaker merged with
Daimler-Benz.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 0.34 percent
Wednesday while the Nasdaq composite was down 0.43 percent. The
Russell 2000, however, did worse than the Dow, falling 1.25
percent.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues outnumbered
advancing ones by 1,737 to 1,348, with 74 making new highs for the
year and 56 new lows. Volume was a moderate 727.43 million.
</P>
<P>
   Shares were mostly lower overseas _ 1.12 percent in Brazil, 1.36
percent in Germany, 1.04 percent in France and 0.55 percent in
Britain. Prices rose, however, in Japan and Hong Kong, by 1.02
percent and 0.8 percent.

 &HT;    Death row escape a black eye for Texas prisonsBy Dave Harmon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   After six days, the dog teams, high-tech helicopters and scores
of officers still haven't found escaped killer Martin Gurule, and
prison officials are leaning on their in-house fugitive hunters to
pick up his scent if he managed to slip out of their 17,000-acre
search area.
</P>
<P>
   Far from the bustling search area, where the dogs and choppers
repeatedly crisscross the same woods and marshes, the Texas
Department of Criminal Justice's internal affairs unit has been
beating the bushes for signs that Gurule has popped up elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``That police activity out there is not visible ... and we're
not going to talk about what they're doing,'' prison spokesman Glen
Castlebury said.
</P>
<P>
   But he made it clear that the information they're receiving from
the 150-member unit has bolstered their ongoing belief that Gurule,
29, is still somewhere inside the seven-mile perimeter they have
established around the Ellis Unit north of Huntsville.
</P>
<P>
   Castlebury said the internal affairs unit is the reason the
prison system has been able to re-capture virtually every escaped
prisoner in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them have been working to find Gurule since early
Friday, when he led six other prisoners in a dash for the prison
fences after cutting through a recreation yard fence and hiding on
the prison roof for three hours.
</P>
<P>
   The other six inmates surrendered when guards opened fire.
Gurule, who shot two men to death during a 1992 restaurant robbery
in Corpus Christi, disappeared into the nearby woods.
</P>
<P>
   Still smarting from the black eye that Gurule gave them by
becoming the first inmate to escape death row in 54 years, prison
officials are trying to underscore their overall record on escapes.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Criminal Justice Institute, a Connecticut-based
group that keeps statistics on escapes nationwide, Texas reported
21 escapes from its prisons in 1996, the last year for which
statistics are available. Texas, which had more than 130,000
inmates that year, reported that all 21 were captured.
</P>
<P>
   California, with roughly 140,000 inmates in 1996, reported 56
escapes and 43 captures. New York, with about 69,000 inmates,
reported five escapes and five captures, while Florida, with about
65,000 inmates, reported 32 escapes and 25 captures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prison system is secure,'' Castlebury said.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas prison system has re-captured all but one prisoner who
escaped in the past decade, he added, with 90 percent of the
escapees caught while still on prison grounds and the other 10
percent tracked down by internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The one that got away has been living in Mexico for the past two
years, he said. ``We can't get him, but we watch him all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Internal affairs reports to the prison board and investigates
escapes as well as possible crimes by prison employees,
inmate-on-inmate crimes and parolees who disappear.
</P>
<P>
   When they have time, Castlebury said, the officers dig through
cold cases, sometimes with dramatic results: Last year, they worked
with other Texas agencies and Mexican officials to re-capture
Ernesto Lopez, who was convicted of murdering a 12-year-old Dallas
girl in 1956 and had escaped from the Harlem State Prison Farm near
Richmond in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any more old cases,'' Castlebury said. ``These
guys cleaned them out.''

GROSSMAN TO QUIT TOP DEMOCRATIC POST

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Steve Grossman, a Massachusetts businessman who as
chairman of the Democratic National Committee helped lead the
party's resurgence and elbowed Boston into the top rank of
contenders for the party's national convention in 2000, announced
Wednesday he is resigning from his post.
</P>
<P>
   In a hastily arranged news conference at the Democratic
headquarters, Grossman said he is resigning to spend more time with
his family, particularly his 79-year-old father, who is suffering
from the debilitating effects of Parkinson's disease and is his
business partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can afford to have an occasional tin ear in politics, but
we can't afford to have a tin ear when it comes to our nearest and
dearest,'' Grossman said.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman, a Democratic activist for nearly 30 years who was
tapped as national party chairman in January 1997, said his leaving
will not hamper Boston's chances of hosting the quadrennial
convention, a comment echoed by the party's general chairman,
Colorado Governor Roy Romer.
</P>
<P>
   Boston is among three cities, including Los Angeles and Denver,
competing to host the convention. By stepping down, ``I can be a
little more aggressive on behalf of Boston,'' Grossman said in an
interview, after describing himself as an ``objective
cheerleader.''
</P>
<P>
   Romer said, ``I'll guarantee you, as a colleague of Steve's, I
would not allow, would not allow, his departure to prejudice that
decision. That's just not the way we do business.''
</P>
<P>
   Grossman, 52, a prodigious fund-raiser and one of the party's
most generous contributors, will leave as soon as President Clinton
picks a successor. That choice must be approved by the 400-plus
members of the DNC, which is not scheduled to hold a full meeting
until March. However, both Grossman and Romer indicated the process
may be accelerated so the leadership issue is settled by
mid-February before the Democrats select a convention site and the
presidential campaign begins to take off.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman's resignation stunned even Romer, who said it ``came as
a surprise to me . . . when Steve gave me a call.'' Volunteering
that he will stay on as general chairman, Romer added, ``I just
want to say, it has been an interesting 22 months.''
</P>
<P>
   Grossman, who was the Massachusetts Democratic Party chairman in
1991-92 and runs Massachusetts Envelope Co. based in Somerville,
Mass., a Boston suburb, has been commuting between Newton, Mass.
and Washington, where he runs the party's day-to-day operation.
</P>
<P>
   He helped mastermind the Democrats' wins in last month's
elections. That effort involved raising millions of dollars in
unregulated campaign contributions, known as soft money, and
spending the funds on get-out-the-vote efforts in selected states
with tight races. The Democratic Party defied historical trends,
becoming the first party since 1822 to pick up seats _ five of them
_ in the sixth year of an incumbent president's term.
</P>
<P>
   But Grossman's signature contribution may be helping the
Democratic Party overcome the taint of fund-raising abuses in the
1996 presidential campaign that triggered judicial and
congressional investigations and ran up a massive legal debt for
the party. He has winnowed the party's roughly $18 million debt in
1996 down to about $8 million today.
</P>
<P>
   At a DNC fund-raiser Tuesday night featuring several new
Democratic members of Congress, Clinton heaped praised on Grossman,
just minutes before the party chairman took him aside and told the
president of his plans to quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't be here if he hadn't put in all the long hours and
long days and long weeks and long months,'' Clinton said at the
fund-raiser. ``He never got tired,'' the president went on. ``I do
get tired. I plead guility, I get tired. Steve Grossman never got
tired. And I think we ought to tell him that we know that and we
thank him so much.''
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton made those remarks, Grossman ``figured, since it
doesn't get any better than this, I'd better let him know right
now,'' he recalled Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The first words out of Clinton's mouth, Grossman recalled in
Wednesday's interview, were, ``We are going to miss you a lot. But
you're doing the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released by the White House, Clinton said:
``While it is good news for his family, the resignation of the DNC
National Chairman Steve Grossman is a loss for the Democratic
Party. Steve has been a leader, a party builder, a prolific
fund-raiser, and a wonderful friend to Hillary and me.''
</P>
<P>
   While he had wanted to leave sooner, Grossman said the November
elections made it more difficult but also allowed him to leave on a
high note.
</P>
<P>
   He said the health of his father, Edgar Grossman, had
deterioriated to the point that he felt a personal responsibility
to be there for him and other family members. He also said he
couldn't bear his 9-year-old son Joshua giving up soccer and
baseball, because in Josh's words: ``When you stopped coming to my
games, it took all the fun out of it.''

<P>
   Connecticut taxpayers concerned about financing details of the
proposed stadium for the New England Patriots flooded House
Democrats with phone calls Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   And Representative Moira Lyons, a Stamford Democrat who stood
behind team owner Robert Kraft to show her support the day he
signed the publicly-financed stadium deal earlier this month, cast
a more critical eye on the plan, under which a new report shows the
state would barely break even.
</P>
<P>
   But in stark contrast to the political climate in Massachusetts,
Connecticut politicians _ from US Senator Christopher Dodd to the
rank and file Democrats who toil under Republican Governor John
Rowland _ renewed their support for completing a deal to solve the
team's need for a new facility.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative leaders met with Rowland for two hours at the state
Capitol Wednesday morning, discussing such things as logistics for
the Dec. 19 special session when the agreement is scheduled to be
voted on, along with the perceived negativity of the Boston press.
</P>
<P>
   However, the bipartisan group said they did not change any
aspect of the Memorandum of Understanding that would bring the
Patriots to a site along the Connecticut River by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   And, following the meeting, lawmakers said they felt the KPMG
Peat Marwick study released Tuesday answered most of the tricky
questions members of the House and Senate had been asking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Peat Marwick report helped us tremendously,'' said House
Speaker Thomas Rittercq, who spent the weekend talking to lawmakers
and gauging what he characterized as strong support.``What we want
to do is make sure this is revenue neutral to the state. That's our
objective here.''
</P>
<P>
   The report showed that, over 30 years, the state would reap $3.2
million in direct stadium revenue after paying off $374 million in
principle and interest for the facility and surrounding
infrastructure. The state would lose money in the first 14 years
but would start to see net revenue generating after that.
</P>
<P>
   But KPMG is working on another study to determine what effect
paying as much as $100 million in cash out of Connecticut's
projected budget surplus would have on the bottom line of the
project. The report, expected to be completed before the Dec. 15
vote, could determine how to substantially shorten the term of the
debt, now estimated at $25 million a year for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assuming they put more cash on the table as opposed to
bonding, that would lower the debt service and shorten the
timeframe,'' said Roy Occhiogrossocq, a spokesman for Senate
President pro tem Kevin Sullivancq. ``It's an option.''
</P>
<P>
   The length of deal is important for another reason.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators, led by Lyons -- who will replace Ritter as Speaker
in January -- wants to know how the state will be protected if
Kraft leaves the state before the 30-year timeframe outlined in the
memorandum of understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the guarantee by which the Patriots would be kept in
Connecticut for the 30-year period,'' Lyons asked. ``I believe
they're attempting to work that out as I speak.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritter would not say whether anyone is trying to tighten the
language of the agreement to assuage such concerns that Kraft could
pull out, leaving the state with a 68,000-seat, open-air facility
that just the University of Connecticut football team would play
in, along with some concerts in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was (a change) I wouldn't tell you,'' Ritter said.
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic caucus, the first to address the stadium plan, is
scheduled for the morning of Dec. 9, when a public hearing on the
subject will be held at the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average legislator has probably gotten about 10 (negative)
phone calls. For something this monumental, I would think you'd get
more phone calls than that,'' Ritter said. ``There is the overall
support of the public. Only those who are opposed are calling.''
</P>
<P>
   While the initial KPMG study answered many questions, there are
some still dangling.

   In addition to an exit clause, Lyons said questions persist
about the state's $17.5 million annual guarantee of luxury seating
sales and who will pay for any project costs over the $350 million,
which could rise to $374 million once inflation is factored in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, is that the absolute number?'' Lyons said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the luxury seat component of the agreement, Dean Pagani,
a spokesman for Rowland, said ``there would be no changes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So far it seems the votes are there. No one has an exact
count.'' Pagani added. ``Everyone wants to be for this, they just
want to spend the next two weeks asking questions.''

   Said Joe Santangelocq, a spokesman for House Minority Leader
Robert Ward, a Northford Republican: ``Our caucus is in general

<P>
   After Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp. announced their $16
billion merger in 1996, European regulators nearly blocked the deal
because they were so worried that the new American aerospace giant
would pose an unfair threat to Airbus Industrie, the European
consortium that is Boeing's sole competitor making large passenger
jets.
</P>
<P>
   But now, almost exactly two years later, in a story that has
come to resemble the fabled race between the tortoise and the hare,
Boeing looks as if it is the company running out of gas while
Airbus appears to be steadily gaining ground.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's stunning disclosure on Tuesday that it would scale back
production of most of its airplanes and cut its work force by an
additional 20,000 jobs over the next two years on top of 28,000
previously announced cuts is the latest in a string of high-profile
embarrassments since it completed the merger in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the cuts, which account for 20 percent of its work
force, Boeing said that it would still earn a profit of only 1
percent to 3 percent on a whopping $50 billion in revenue in 2000 _
a margin more in line with a supermarket chain than the maker of
jets that sell for $150 million each.
</P>
<P>
   Investors had bid up Boeing shares in recent months in the
belief that the company was on the road to recovery after posting
its first annual loss in 50 years in 1997. They abandoned the stock
in droves Wednesday as nine Wall Street analysts downgraded their
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Boeing plunged $6.6875, or 16.5 percent, to $33.6875
in record volume on the New York Stock Exchange. The steep decline
helped drag the Dow Jones industrial average down 69 points, to
close at 9,064.54.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing executives said that the latest announcements were the
unfortunate result of the economic downturn in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation in Asia has worsened dramatically,'' Philip M.
Condit, Boeing's chairman and chief executive, told analysts and
reporters Wednesday, adding that it was ``much deeper and more
prolonged than we had first estimated.''
</P>
<P>
   But many who watch Boeing say that the effect of Asia should
have been clear to the company's top executives months ago _ when
they dropped an earlier bombshell on Wall Street by disclosing
lower-than-expected earnings estimates that were revised even lower
on Tuesday. The downturn itself, they added, is to blame for only a
small part of the company's troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, external factors have played a role,'' said Byron Callan,
an aerospace analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York. ``But 80 to 90
percent of the problems Boeing has today are problems that Boeing
created.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Airbus operates in the same global economy as Boeing,
yet it appears to be suffering far less. Just how well _ or badly _
Airbus is doing is difficult to measure because as a private
company it does not have to disclose its financial condition the
way Boeing does.
</P>
<P>
   But David Venz, an Airbus spokesman, said Wednesday that the
airplane maker has lost orders for only 15 of its single-aisle
models because of the Asian recession and that it had only a
handful of finished jets sitting in storage waiting for buyers to
arrange financing for them. Boeing, on the other hand, has 24
planes in storage, down from 36 at the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   The two competitors approach the market in different ways.
Airbus, which is hampered by European restrictions on laying off
workers, has decided to expand its airplane production steadily. It
plans to produce 234 airplanes this year, 293 in 1999 and 317 in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing is more manic, increasing production and hiring tens of
thousands of workers in boom times, then laying them off when the
downturn comes. It says it will produce 550 passenger jets this
year and a record 620 next year before decreasing to 490 in 2000.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Boeing's current troubles date back to its ill-fated decision in
1996 to win market share at all costs. Worried that it would lose
ground to Airbus, Boeing agreed to deliver hundreds of planes at
cut-rate prices in the mistaken belief that it could overhaul its
antiquated production methods and deliver a record number of
airplanes at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   After laying off 30,000 thousand workers during a slump in the
early 1990s, Boeing hired 32,000 new workers in just 18 months.
Though Boeing has the image of a technologically advanced company,
each of its planes is essentially custom-made from millions of
parts that are tracked by paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are still building these aircraft in the primitive way
they were using 40 years ago,'' said E. Han Kim, a professor of
finance and international business at the University of Michigan
Business School.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the new workers did not have the same refined skills as
the journeymen they replaced. To make matters worse, Boeing's
factories were soon overwhelmed by parts shortages. Production fell
so far out of kilter that the company was forced to freeze
production of its 747 and 737 models for a month in October 1997 in
order to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   The blunder cost the company $4 billion in accounting charges
and angered many of its customers. Airbus has since won key orders
from longtime Boeing customers like United Airlines, United Parcel
Service and British Airways, which had an all-Boeing fleet until it
decided in August to buy a fleet of Airbus planes.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, in the meantime, is still trying to recover. Harry S.
Stonecipher, Boeing's president, said Wednesday that the company
still took 20 percent to 30 percent more hours to produce an
airplane than it did in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   After dismissing the head of the airplane division in September
and installing Alan R. Mulally, who played a key role in the
development of the 777, Condit says that Boeing is committed to
increasing its productivity and still thinks the company can
achieve double-digit profit margins, though he will not say when.
</P>
<P>
   Mulally is now in the unenviable position of having to motivate
a work force to give 110 percent at a time when it knows that the
ax is about to fall. ``I imagine that you could probably scrape
morale off the floor at this point,'' Callan said.
</P>
<P>
   And because Boeing must still produce 620 airplanes next year,
the bulk of the layoffs will most likely occur in the last half of
the year, just when Boeing is scheduled to begin negotiating a new
contract with the International Association of Machinists, which
represents 40,000 of its hourly workers. The union struck Boeing
for 69 days during the last round of negotiations in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   If things do not improve at Boeing soon, the machinists may not
be the only ones fearing for their jobs. ``I don't know how many
chances you get to get your credibility back,'' said Nicholas
Heymann, an aerospace analyst at Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Callan of Merrill Lynch said, ``There are institutional
investors who recently saw light when the stock was at 40 again and
just lost 18 percent of their value today, and they are going to
want action.''

<P>
   Connecticut taxpayers concerned about financing details of the
proposed stadium for the New England Patriots flooded House
Democrats with phone calls Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   And Representative Moira Lyons, a Stamford Democrat who stood
behind team owner Robert Kraft to show her support the day he
signed the publicly-financed stadium deal earlier this month, cast
a more critical eye on the plan, under which a new report shows the
state would barely break even.
</P>
<P>
   But in stark contrast to the political climate in Massachusetts,
Connecticut politicians _ from US Senator Christopher Dodd to the
rank and file Democrats who toil under Republican Governor John
Rowland _ renewed their support for completing a deal to solve the
team's need for a new facility.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative leaders met with Rowland for two hours at the state
Capitol Wednesday morning, discussing such things as logistics for
the Dec. 19 special session when the agreement is scheduled to be
voted on, along with the perceived negativity of the Boston press.
</P>
<P>
   However, the bipartisan group said they did not change any
aspect of the Memorandum of Understanding that would bring the
Patriots to a site along the Connecticut River by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   And, following the meeting, lawmakers said they felt the KPMG
Peat Marwick study released Tuesday answered most of the tricky
questions members of the House and Senate had been asking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Peat Marwick report helped us tremendously,'' said House
Speaker Thomas Rittercq, who spent the weekend talking to lawmakers
and gauging what he characterized as strong support.``What we want
to do is make sure this is revenue neutral to the state. That's our
objective here.''
</P>
<P>
   The report showed that, over 30 years, the state would reap $3.2
million in direct stadium revenue after paying off $374 million in
principle and interest for the facility and surrounding
infrastructure. The state would lose money in the first 14 years
but would start to see net revenue generating after that.
</P>
<P>
   But KPMG is working on another study to determine what effect
paying as much as $100 million in cash out of Connecticut's
projected budget surplus would have on the bottom line of the
project. The report, expected to be completed before the Dec. 15
vote, could determine how to substantially shorten the term of the
debt, now estimated at $25 million a year for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assuming they put more cash on the table as opposed to
bonding, that would lower the debt service and shorten the
timeframe,'' said Roy Occhiogrossocq, a spokesman for Senate
President pro tem Kevin Sullivancq. ``It's an option.''
</P>
<P>
   The length of deal is important for another reason.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators, led by Lyons -- who will replace Ritter as Speaker
in January -- wants to know how the state will be protected if
Kraft leaves the state before the 30-year timeframe outlined in the
memorandum of understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the guarantee by which the Patriots would be kept in
Connecticut for the 30-year period,'' Lyons asked. ``I believe
they're attempting to work that out as I speak.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritter would not say whether anyone is trying to tighten the
language of the agreement to assuage such concerns that Kraft could
pull out, leaving the state with a 68,000-seat, open-air facility
that just the University of Connecticut football team would play
in, along with some concerts in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was (a change) I wouldn't tell you,'' Ritter said.
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic caucus, the first to address the stadium plan, is
scheduled for the morning of Dec. 9, when a public hearing on the
subject will be held at the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average legislator has probably gotten about 10 (negative)
phone calls. For something this monumental, I would think you'd get
more phone calls than that,'' Ritter said. ``There is the overall
support of the public. Only those who are opposed are calling.''
</P>
<P>
   While the initial KPMG study answered many questions, there are
some still dangling.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to an exit clause, Lyons said questions persist
about the state's $17.5 million annual guarantee of luxury seating
sales and who will pay for any project costs over the $350 million,
which could rise to $374 million once inflation is factored in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, is that the absolute number?'' Lyons said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the luxury seat component of the agreement, Dean Pagani,
a spokesman for Rowland, said ``there would be no changes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So far it seems the votes are there. No one has an exact
count.'' Pagani added. ``Everyone wants to be for this, they just
want to spend the next two weeks asking questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Joe Santangelocq, a spokesman for House Minority Leader
Robert Ward, a Northford Republican: ``Our caucus is in general
support and we expect it's going to pass.''

TEXAS A&AMP;M EXPECTS TO MARCH AGAINST KANSAS STATE DEFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Perspective can be a unique thing.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M players, who struggled to produce 173 yards against a
Texas defense ranked ninth in the Big 12 in their most recent
outing, said they expect to move the ball with authority against
the league's stingiest unit in Saturday's Big 12 title game.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   The 10-2 Aggies, ranked 10th in The Associated Press poll, have
been encouraged by videotape reviews of recent efforts by No. 2
Kansas State (11-0), which will bring the league's top-rated
defense to St. Louis for the 3:30 p.m. game Saturday at the Trans
World Dome. The Wildcats have surrendered a combined 791 yards and
55 points in their past two outings, which were high-scoring
victories against Nebraska (40-30) and Missouri (31-25).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to give away the game plan, but they've got some
holes out there. They're beatable. They're not 1997 Nebraska,''
said wide receiver Chris Cole, comparing the Wildcats to the
Cornhuskers' squad that hammered A&AMP;M, 54-15, in last year's title
game. ``They're a team that can be beat, I promise. If we execute
our offense, we can win.''
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M players and coaches offered a litany of reasons why the
Aggies could not produce more than 173 yards, including minus-7
yards on the ground, in last week's 26-24 loss to Texas. Among
them: slippery turf, overthrown receivers, underthrown receivers,
dropped passes and blown assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Those mistakes, said A&AMP;M players, should not resurface against
the Wildcats. In their minds, the Texas game represents a
statistical aberration rather than a reason to panic for an offense
that ranks 95th among 112 teams in Division I-A.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M players also were quick to discount any residual effects
from last year's 35-17 loss in Manhattan, Kan. During that contest,
Kansas State limited A&AMP;M to four first downs and 90 yards total
offense, including minus 35 on the ground. It remains A&AMP;M's most
futile offensive effort in 10 seasons under coach R.C. Slocum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we were undefeated when we went up there and I
don't think we were ready for them,'' tight end Dan Campbell said.
``Nebraska had already stomped them \R56-26\S and we felt like they
were just another team. Now, we know how good they are. We know
what we're getting into.''
</P>
<P>
   Statistically, the Wildcats offer the nation's second-ranked
defense, allowing 251.6 yards and 11.3 points per game. But the
Aggies, who have gained 232 yards or less on five occasions this
season, insist they see chinks in the Wildcats' defensive armor
they can exploit.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska, after all, rushed for 212 yards. Missouri, which ranks
11th among Big 12 teams in passing offense (two spots below A&AMP;M),
threw for 249 yards and two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we minimize our mistakes, we ought to be able to compete
with their defense,'' quarterback Randy McCown said. ``We just
can't afford to waste our scoring chances. When we get them, we've
got to cash in.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly in the passing game, said McCown, who identified
the secondary as ``the soft spot'' of the Kansas State defense.
Cole praised the Wildcats' defenders but said they are not in the
same class as Florida State, which defeated A&AMP;M, 23-14, on Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the most athletic team I've seen in my life,'' Cole
said of the Seminoles. ``They had guys on the defensive line that
could play in the secondary. You don't see many teams like that.
Kansas State can play, but not like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we're going in looking to make some big plays in
the air. If we have to throw 1,000 times to win this game, we'll do
it. We've got to redeem ourselves ... and get to a big-time bowl.
They're just a little obstacle in our way.''
</P>
<P>
   A stagnant offense, of course, could be a major encumbrance in
clearing such an obstacle. But when they look in the mirror, the
Aggies don't see one, despite recent evidence to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one game out of 12. You're going to have days like
that,'' said tailback Dante Hall, who gained 8 yards on 10 carries
against Texas. ``We need to find a way not to let that happen
again. But I don't know how we're going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Slocum said: ``You look at how football works from one week to
the next, it may be a totally different situation in St. Louis.
Yes, their defense, over the course of the season, has been better
than Texas. But it comes down to that one day.''

MOBIL CEO HAS PAY INCENTIVE TO SELL COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also EXXON-TEXACO, EXXON-GAS-STATIONS, EXXON-OPEC,
EXXON-ROCKEFELLER) 
(bl) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A lot of people were surprised that Mobil Corp. chairman Lucio
Noto was willing to sell the company to Exxon Corp., but a look at
his pay package shows that he had powerful incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Noto, 60, can collect at least $6 million in cash just by
leaving if the deal goes through, although he said Tuesday he would
become vice chairman of the merged company.
</P>
<P>
   After the deal closes, he would be free to harvest stock options
that otherwise would not be ripe, removing the risk that depressed
oil prices will make them worth less in the future. And if he sells
now the value of his 1996 and 1997 options will balloon by 41
percent under terms of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, by selling Mobil and then leaving the company, Noto
would be freed from company policies that force him to hold almost
all of his wealth in a basket filled with Mobil shares. For a man
who has said that he foresees some tough years for the oil industry
_ oil is selling at the depressed price of about $11 a barrel _
there must have been at least a few thoughts about the benefits of
taking some of his $58 million or so of Mobil wealth out of that
basket and spreading it around in investments with a less risky
future.
</P>
<P>
   Those would be significant achievements for Noto, a lifelong
Mobil employee, especially since the Mobil board of directors
compensation committee determined that in his first three years as
chief executive, 1994 to 1997, the company's performance was merely
average compared with other large oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   But that committee also decided that Noto's salary and bonus
have been low relative to chief executives at comparable oil
companies and gave him a $40,000 raise to $930,000 starting July 1,
1997, as well as a bonus of $1.13 million, up from $650,000 in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   In February of 1997 Mobil's board also doubled his annual award
of stock options to 140,000, then doubled it again ``in recognition
of special achievements of long-term value to the company.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There are sharp differences in style between Noto, a man with
social skills and considerable charm, and Lee Raymond, who would
remain chief executive at Exxon and is a very private man known for
his ability to recall minute details. These and other differences
have raised some questions about whether the two could work
together for long.
</P>
<P>
   William Randol, an independent energy consultant in New York,
expressed bewilderment over what prompted Noto to recommend that
the board sell Mobil. ``He has a strong personality, he is an
energetic guy and a not insignificant ego,'' Randol said. ``He is
going to be taking the back seat in this combination and that is
very strange.''
</P>
<P>
   The relative inattention outsiders have given to Noto's pay
package and how he will be better off if the merger goes through is
not surprising. Mobil is a master at making sure it discloses as
little as legally possible about how it pays executives.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Foley, an executive compensation lawyer in White Plains,
N.Y., spent several hours going over Mobil documents trying to
flush out the subtle points that can add enormous value to pay
packages. He found little.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mobil guys have taken a lean cuisine approach to
disclosure,'' Foley said, adding that he tried to parse one key
document, a 1995 pay plan that is critical to analyzing how
executives will fare in the merger, and concluded ``that it doesn't
say boo.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearl Meyer, whose Pearl Meyer &AMP; Partners in New York advises
companies on executive pay, also said she was struck by how little
Mobil has disclosed in filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   She found that the Mobil board has ``an unusual plan,'' which is
more restrictive than other companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the majority of companies you have automatic triggers''
that let executives cash out if a company is sold, she said.
Mobil's plan, however, leaves to company directors the discretion
to let executives collect their severance packages and exercise all
their options.
</P>
<P>
   A Mobil spokesman, David Bailey, said the company would not
comment on whether Mobil directors had taken any steps to let
executives collect these so-called golden parachutes and other
benefits. He said the sale was recommended by Noto solely because
``it is in the best interests of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Noto's 1996 and 1997 options are worth $8.3 million on paper
without the Exxon deal, but if it goes through he not only can turn
those options into cash, they will also swell 41 percent in value
to $11.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The options are worth more because each Mobil share would be
exchanged for 1.32 Exxon shares, effectively raising the value of
Mobil shares, which closed yesterday at $84.1875, to $94.06, based
on Exxon's closing price of $71.25 per share.
</P>
<P>
   How much Noto is paid this year, and how many stock options he
was awarded, will not be known until the next proxy statement. That
is not due until May, but may be issued sooner because of the
merger.
</P>
<P>
   However, if the board followed the pay practices outlined in its
disclosure statements, Noto would have received at least 140,000
options last February. That would mean he has options worth $10.3
million but that cannot be converted into cash yet. If the deal
goes through these options would be worth $15 million, a 46 percent
increase.  &QL;

DEATH ROW ESCAPEE `COULD BE ANYWHERE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN MORITZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ Martin Gurule, the Death Row inmate who
pulled off a daring escape from one of Texas' most heavily guarded
prisons, remains on the lam with authorities reluctantly
acknowledging Wednesday that he ``could be anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   But Texas Department of Criminal Justice officials said the most
likely scenario is that the killer of a Corpus Christi restaurant
owner remains holed up in the swampy, snake-infested woods
surrounding the Ellis Prison Unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no hard information that he is not in this area,''
said Glen Castlebury, a prison system spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of an intensive search with law officers and packs of
tracking dogs combing the woods, officials tried for the second day
Wednesday to lull the 29-year-old fugitive into a false sense of
security.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want him to relax,'' Castlebury said ``But when he makes a
move, he's a goner.''
</P>
<P>
   Some in this Southeast Texas community of 35,000 said they
.MDNM/suspect that Gurule made a clean getaway Thanksgiving night,
when he and six other Death Row inmates bolted from a prison chapel
rooftop and scrambled toward a fence topped with razor-wire.
</P>
<P>
   All but Gurule surrendered inside the fence after prison guards
opened fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess, he's gone,'' said Ben Wade, a convenience store
clerk who works a few miles from the Ellis Unit. ``He's probably in
Mexico by now.''
</P>
<P>
   Wade said some motorists who stopped at his store off Interstate
45 told him they feared getting out of their automobiles because
Gurule was on the loose.
</P>
<P>
   Huntsville residents are generally taking the escape in stride,
said Robert Barley, another store clerk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people here either work for TDCJ or used to work
for TDCJ,'' said Barley, a former correctional officer. ``And most
of us carry guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, prison mug shots of Gurule, Death Row inmate 999063,
are being distributed along the Texas-Mexico border in case the
inmate slipped.MDNM/ through the army of law officers that
converged on Huntsville, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, he could have caught a ride somewhere out here and
gotten past our checkpoints,'' said Larry Fitzgerald, another
prison system spokesman. ``There's nothing to suggest he has.
There's been no reports of stolen cars or stolen clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if he did get past us, he could be anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that although the activity around the prison unit
has attracted the most attention, law officers across Texas are
aiding in the manhunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much of this looks like a one-dimensional effort focused
around the prison,'' Castlebury said. ``But, in fact, there is a
police intelligence network that has been put to bear across this
state almost as soon as the inmate went over the fence.''
</P>
<P>
   Castlebury sidestepped questions about whether law officers had
contacted friends and relatives of the inmates captured in the
prison break attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not confirm anything on police intelligence efforts,''
Castlebury said. ``You can use your own common sense based on what
you know about law enforcement's fugitive-apprehension
techniques.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the escape, law officers and about 70 dogs have tramped
through the 11,000 acres of heavy woods a few miles south of the
Trinity River in remote Walker County. Helicopters on loan from the
National Guard, the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the
Coast Guard crisscrossed the area outfitted, searching with
infrared heat-sensors.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday the scene appeared more sedate. The farm road leading
to the Ellis Unit was dotted with gray-uniformed correctional
officers _ some standing, others watching while sitting on patio
chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Most officers built small, open-pit campfires fueled by deadwood
collected from the piney woods that surround the prison.
</P>
<P>
   Helicopters buzzed the woods only sporadically, and the dog
teams rested. Officials said the dogs will.MDNM/ be used randomly
or if there is cause to believe that Gurule is on the move.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Public Safety troopers and correctional officers
continued to stop and search all vehicles on roads leading from the
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Polunsky, chairman of the Texas Board of Criminal Justice,
has appointed a committee to investigate all aspects of the state's
first successful Death Row escape since the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be looking at how the doors are locked. To how the
inmates are taken to work areas, to anything else involved in
inmate security,'' Castlebury said.

RED SOX MAY SEEK SERVICES OF WILL CLARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone for a cheap Thrill?
</P>
<P>
   That's the question they're asking on Yawkey Way, where the Red
Sox are pondering a pursuit of Will ``The Thrill'' Clark, the
newest potential replacement part for Mo Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Dan Duquette was there the day Clark, playing
for the US Olympic team in 1984, hit three home runs in Fenway
Park. He hasn't homered in Fenway since, but his .438 average (35
for 80) there is his personal best in any ballpark. Only six of his
hits at Fenway were for extra bases (five doubles and a triple).
</P>
<P>
   Clark, a 13-year veteran who turns 35 March 13, had hoped to
return to the Texas Rangers, where he finished out a five-year
contract with his best season in a Ranger uniform, batting .305
with 23 home runs, 98 runs, and 102 RBIs. More important, he
appeared in 149 games, his most since 1990, when he was with the
Giants.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, apparently reluctant to give Clark a multiyear
extension because of his injury history with the club, instead
lured Rafael Palmeiro back to Texas with a five-year, $45 million
deal. Clark, who had held back from shopping his services around
until Texas made its move, became the best available free agent
first baseman left and should come a good deal cheaper than either
Vaughn (six years, $80 million) or Palmeiro. The Red Sox might be
able to get away with signing him to a two- or three-year deal,
though as of early Wednesday evening, they had not made an offer.
</P>
<P>
   According to agent Jeff Moorad, Clark would love to come here.
</P>
<P>
   ``My position is clear,'' said Moorad, who along with Leigh
Steinberg represents Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe. ``If Boston
is interested in Will Clark, Will Clark is interested in the Red
Sox.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox have enough interest in Clark that on Monday,
Duquette asked manager Jimy Williams to place a call to the New
Orleans native, who is known for his feisty and aggressive approach
to the game.
</P>
<P>
   For most of last season, Clark hit fifth in the Texas order
behind Juan Gonzalez, who saw enough good pitches to hit .318 with
45 home runs and 157 RBIs, numbers that helped him win the American
League's Most Valuable Player Award. But for much of his career,
Clark has been a No. 3 hitter and could fill that role for the Red
Sox.
</P>
<P>
   There are trade avenues the Red Sox could explore for a first
baseman. Seattle, which has to move outfielder Jay Buhner to first
because of his shoulder surgery, would be willing to trade David
Segui. Expansion Tampa Bay has two veteran first basemen, Fred
McGriff and Paul Sorrento, who have a year left on their contracts.
The Brewers could move injury-prone John Jaha, and the Marlins
might listen to offers for Cliff Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   But Clark, a six-time All-Star (last appearance, 1994) who hit a
home run in his first big league at-bat off Nolan Ryan and 10
seasons ago was runner-up to Giants teammate Kevin Mitchell in the
National League's MVP voting, is arguably the best of the lot.
</P>
<P>
   Voted the nation's top college player at Mississippi State in
1985, Clark had just one month last season in which he hit under
.300, and with runners in scoring position, he batted .318. The
lefthanded batter hit better against lefties (.327) than righties
(.297), but in two playoff series for the Rangers, both against the
Yankees, he hit just .111 (3 for 27).
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, he slipped last season, making 13 errors after
committing just four in each of the previous two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But he was healthy until he fractured his right big toe when hit
by a pitch by Tampa Bay's Julio Santana Sept. 12. He missed two
games before returning to the lineup as DH.
</P>
<P>
   Before last season, he had a series of injuries with Texas. At
various times, he went on the disabled list with a pulled left
quadriceps, badly bruised rib cage, strained right calf muscle,
sprained left wrist and fractured finger, and torn fascia tissue in
his right heel.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of track record would scare a few teams away. But
Clark is at a point in his career that he's not looking for a
long-term commitment. He's looking to play for a contender, and
with his track record, he won't be intimidated about being the man
who replaces Vaughn.

149 MERGERS INVOLVING U.S. COMPANIES IN '98 _ WHAT'S GOING ON?
WORLDWIDE COMPETITION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LAURA GOLDBERG 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The blockbuster deals just keep coming and coming.
</P>
<P>
   Citicorp and Travelers Group. Chrysler Corp. and Daimler-Benz.
GTE Corp. and Bell Atlantic Corp. And now Exxon Corp. and Mobil
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been an unbelievable record year,'' said Bill Clark,
chief operating officer of Mergerstat, a Los Angeles firm that
monitors mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, 149 mergers involving U.S. companies worth $1
billion or more have been announced, for a total value of $886
billion, according to Mergerstat. For all of 1997, by comparison,
there were 110 such deals worth $359 billion.
</P>
<P>
   So what's going on?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worldwide competition,'' said Dennis Block, head of the
mergers and acquisition practice at the New York law firm of
Cadwalader, Wickersham &AMP; Taft. ``To compete worldwide, you need a
greater critical mass.''
</P>
<P>
   Also driving the consolidation among such big players, is the
availability of currency in the form of stock to carry out such big
deals and a generally favorable regulatory climate.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a tendency within any given industry to follow the
leader. Once one megamerger is unveiled there's instant buzz about
others that could, and sometimes ultimately do, follow.
</P>
<P>
   Still, big companies seek to join forces for many of the same
reasons as smaller ones. They are looking for ways to boost
revenues, cut costs, drive up earnings or all three. Buying another
company can offer an instant array of opportunities: new markets; a
channel for selling products to new customers; access to
technology; or the ability to slash costs by eliminating
duplication.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies can not afford to do everything on a home-grown
basis,'' said Albert Viscio, a partner in the strategic leadership
practice of Booz-Allen &AMP; Hamilton, a Washington, D.C.-based
management and technology consulting firm &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   David Nadler, chairman of the New York-based Delta Consulting
Group, which advises corporate executives on organizational
changes, said changes _ including increased worldwide competition,
access to more markets, new information technology and deflated
commodity prices _ are so fundamental and so disruptive that even
the biggest players are affected.
</P>
<P>
   Technology allows corporations to better manage far-flung
networks and very large organizations. In some industries, such as
telecommunications, it plays an additional role. Corporations want
to pool resources so they can offer new, but
expensive-to-bring-on-line technology to customers as quickly and
cheaply as possible  &UR; t &LR; o as many markets as possible.
</P>
<P>
   In October testimony to the Federal Communications Commission,
Ivan Seidenberg, Bell Atlantic's chief executive, said a handful of
large, global, full-service communications companies are emerging.
He was commenting on Bell Atlantic's pending deal to merge with
GTE.
</P>
<P>
   To succeed, he said, each will need: global reach, a full range
of services, strong high-speed data capabilities, financial
strength and technological leadership. The planned merger, he said,
is a reaction to changing technologies and rising consumer
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Varettoni, a Bell Atlantic spokesman, said last
year's &UR;  &LR; acquistion of NYNEX Corp. allowed the companies to roll out
new data-transmission capabilities faster and cheaper than if each
acted separately. For 1998, $450 million in expense savings and
another $300 million in capital outlay savings are expected. Over
three years, some 3,000 management jobs are slated to go.
</P>
<P>
   Before the merger, Bell Atlantic served six states including
Pennsylvania, while NYNEX covered in seven including New York and
Massachusetts. Combining the markets allowed Bell Atlantic to offer
cellular phone service that reaches across the whole Eastern
Seaboard, Varettoni said.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic also adopted NYNEX's marketing techniques for
phone services such as caller ID and calling waiting. The result,
Varettonti said, in the first 100 days some 1.4 million new phone
service features were sold systemwide.
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, the telecommunications industry is going through
tremendous consolidation because it was so fragmented, said Diego
Veitia, chairman and chief executive of International Assets
Holding Corp., an investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   At Citigroup, formerly Citicorp and Travelers Group, the focus
wasn't size, a spokesman said. The merger, announced in April and
carried out in October, was the second-biggest, behind Exxon-Mobil,
in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were never really driven by the desire to be the largest
anything,'' said Citigroup spokesman Jack Morris. The merger
``gives us a complete array of financial products and multiple
distribution systems around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Travelers operations were focused in the United States, while
Citicorp was worldwide. Citicorp was the world's largest issuer of
credit cards and offered banking products. Travelers offerings
included insurance and asset management. Now, Travelers army of
insurance agents can offer credit cards or banking services to its
customers. And Travelers products can be distributed abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, Morris said, $1 billion in new revenue is expected
because of the merger.
</P>
<P>
   James McTevia, chairman of the Michigan-based McTevia and
Associates, which advises companies in transition, also pointed to
another merger that plays off the strengths of each partner &UR; ,  &LR; the
Daimler-Benz and Chrysler pairing that took effect in November.
</P>
<P>
   Daimler-Benz, he said, has markets in India that Chrysler
doesn't, while Chrysler is firmly entrenched in places such as
South America and Mexico. Chrysler is far ahead in design
technology, while Daimler leads in engineering technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Also fueling megamergers is that federal regulators have largely
been willing to let the deals go through _ even though corporations
sometimes are required to sell off some assets.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say no one should mistake a willing attitude as a sign
the feds don't have the legal power to regulate the big billion
dollar deals.
</P>
<P>
   John Solow, a professor of economic at University of Iowa who
specializes in antitrust economics, said he believes regulators are
generally asking the right questions when it comes to megamergers
and competition issues. He said they are taking into account global
marketplace pressures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we need to rethink the way we think about
mergers,'' he said, adding that he doesn't believe the Clinton
anti-trust officials have been asleep at the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   But some critics of megamergers are concerned that even if the
legal tools are there, they aren't being properly used.
</P>
<P>
   James Brock, a University of Miami in Oxford, Ohio, and author
of ``Dangerous Pursuits: Mergers and Acquisitions in the Age of
Wall Street,'' said many of the deals strike him as
anti-competitive, he said, and don't perform well. And, he said, if
these larger corporations such as banks fail, the country could
face huge bailout tabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me organizations the size of these merged
organizations that we're seeing start to look eerily like central
Soviet planning in the old Communist system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brock said the government is looking at the issue of
anti-competitiveness too narrowly. Allowing large bank mergers
after forcing divestiture of once-competing branches on the same
street corner is an example, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense of it is they're asking far too narrow questions and
they suffer from a kind of tunnel vision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators budgets and staffs are dwarfed by those of
the big companies they are evaluating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is very clear they're swamped,'' he said. ``There's
no question about that.'' &QL;

BOSTON EXPECTED TO APPEAL RULING ON SCHOOL QUOTA SCHEME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH DALEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a decision that could affect public school
desegregation plans nationwide, the Boston School Committee is
expected to appeal to the US Supreme Court the recent federal court
ruling declaring Boston Latin School's admissions policy
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the School Department announced Wednesday that all
students invited to the city's three exam schools for next
September will be admitted strictly on merit, without considering
race.
</P>
<P>
   If the Supreme Court decides to hear the Latin case _ which
could happen as early as the spring _ it would be the first
public-school affirmative action appeal heard by the high court. In
recent years, the Supreme Court and other federal courts have
increasingly overturned racial quotas in cases involving government
employment and college admission, but not in cases involving public
school students.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is so important that we must seek the final judgment
of the highest court to give us clear direction,'' Boston School
Superintendent Thomas W. Payzant said Wednesday before an evening
executive session of the School Committee that was called to vote
on the issue. ``This is a threshold case with respect to
affirmative action and public and secondary schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the First Circuit Court of Appeals said the
Boston School Committee improperly defined diversity strictly in
terms of race in its admissions policy for the prestigious Latin
School.
</P>
<P>
   The court ordered the white plaintiff, Dorchester 10th-grader
Sarah Wessmann, to immediately be admitted to Latin.
</P>
<P>
   Under the admissions policy the court threw out, half of
students were admitted based strictly on scores, and half based on
race and scores. Wessmann had been passed over despite scoring
better than 10 minorities admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Next year will be the first time in 25 years that race is not
used as a factor in admissions to Latin, and the number of
minorities admitted is expected to drop, although not dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   This year, if race had not been used in admitting students to
Latin, 13 percent of seventh-graders would be black or Hispanic,
compared to the current class that is 20 percent black and
Hispanic. Systemwide, blacks and Hispanics make up 75 percent of
Boston's 64,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond its affect on admissions to Boston's exam schools, the
court case has the potential for large national repercussions. If
the Supreme Court upholds the Appeals Court in disallowing race as
a factor in admissions at Latin, the ruling may set a precedent for
lawsuits against any race-based student assignment policy in any
school district. Boston currently assigns students to schools based
on choice and race.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, federal courts are lifting school desegregation
orders in cities such as Denver and Oklahoma City, saying that past
discrimination has been remedied and there is no longer need for
federal oversight. If the Supreme Court takes the Latin case,
school officials nationally may use its decision as a guide in
designing student assignment policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt the case is going to be important,'' said
Wendy Parmet, a Northeastern law professor.
</P>
<P>
   Parmet said the highest court, if they take the case, can look
at the Latin appeal in one of two broad ways: as a general
race-based policy in education, or more narrowly as a ruling on
race-based admissions criteria in a city with a history of
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Supreme Court does not speak often on race base remedies
and every time they do, it is important, widely read and
observed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal is just the latest twist in a three-year battle at
Boston Latin School that involved two admission policies and two
white students, each claiming she was unfairly denied entrance
because she is white.
</P>
<P>
   Julia McLaughlin, the first plaintiff, successfully challenged
an admission policy that automatically set aside 35 percent of all
seats for blacks and Hispanics. Wessmann, now a student at Boston
Latin Academy and expected to start at Latin in January,
successfully challenged the revised admissions plan created by the
school committee after the McLaughlin case. Wessmann's lawyer is
Michael McLaughlin, Julia's father.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, McLaughlin said ``If the School Committee decides to
go to the Supreme Court, that is its prerogative. The question I
would have is whether they can point to any significant
inconsistencies with the first decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The seven-member School Committee had three options before it
Wednesday night: not to appeal; to appeal the decision back to a
federal court of appeals, or appeal it to the Supreme Court. The
deadline for filing to the appeals court was Wednesday. The Supreme
Court deadline is in three months.
</P>
<P>
   While he did not have a figure on how much an appeal would cost,
Payzant said Wednesday night filing an appeal would not be
expensive because the Supreme Court will review the appeal court
decision and not hold a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   Payzant said no white parents have ``officially'' approached him
demanding to have their child admitted to an exam school because
they scored higher than minorities who were admitted, since the
appeal court decision.
</P>
<P>
   And while Payzant said he was concerned by the Supreme Court's
recent rulings against affirmative action policies, he said it was
still important to have the case decided.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be a different standard that should be used for
public elementary and secondary schools than would be applied in
higher education institutions,'' he said. The supreme court's
position ``doesn't deter me from believing we need to give it our
best argument.''
</P>
<P>
   The school department is expected to use before the Supreme
Court the same main two arguments it used before the the First
Circuit Court of Appeals in defending using race as a factor in
admissions.
</P>
<P>
   They were that diversity has a genuine educational value, and
that past racial discrimination is enough reason to use race today
when admitting students. Both arguments were rejected by the First
Circuit of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Some legal experts have said that one way the U.S. Supreme Court
could allow a race-based Latin admissions policy, even after having
ruled against affirmative action in other cases, would be by ruling
that diversity has more importance in public education than in
either the private sector or universities.

ESPY ACQUITTED OF ALL COUNTS OF ACCEPTING ILLEGAL GIFTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A jury acquitted former Agriculture Secretary Mike
Espy on all 30 counts of accepting illegal gifts from corporations,
delivering a decisive blow to a lengthy independent counsel
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing 70 prosecution witnesses called by Independent
Counsel Donald Smaltz, the jury deliberated for nine hours before
finding Espy innocent of accepting free tickets to sporting events
and gifts for his girlfriend from farm companies under his agency's
regulatory arm in 1993 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cost a lot. It's been tough. But I knew from day one that
I would stand here today before you completely exonerated,'' said
Espy, 45, who was forced to resign in 1994 because of the
accusations.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, facing his own independent counsel, said he
was ``pleased by the jury's verdict.'' He said the former
Mississippi congressman ``worked hard and successfully to create a
department that now better serves the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Smaltz, the first of several independent counsels appointed to
investigate members of Clinton's Cabinet, spent four years and $17
million on the investigation. His probe has netted 15 previous
convictions of lobbyists and executives.
</P>
<P>
   But his wide-ranging investigation drew complaints of excess
even before critics directed their wrath at Kenneth Starr, who is
investigating several aspects of Clinton's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We met our obligation and the jury has spoken,'' Smaltz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our investigation and prosecutions dissuade corporations
from giving gifts to their regulators, and the regulators from
accepting gifts from those who are regulated, I believe that the
costs we have occurred are worth the price,'' Smaltz said.
</P>
<P>
   Espy, joined outside the courthouse by his brother Henry who
also was indicted by Smaltz and acquitted in a separate trial,
criticized independent counsels as ``someone with all the money,
all the power, very little supervision, no timetable, to unleash
powerful hoards of prosecutors (on) you and your family.''
</P>
<P>
   Espy said that he hopes he is the first witness before Congress
next year when members decided whether to renew the expiring law
that authorizes the appointment of independent counsels against
high-ranking executive branch officials.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the independent counsel law, Smaltz said, ``That's a
matter for Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Smaltz angered many Clinton supporters when he tried to extend
his investigation into the relationship between the president and
Arkansas-based Tyson Foods. His creation of his own web site on the
Internet also drew criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Espy and Clinton, independent counsels also are
investigating accusations against Labor Secretary Alexis Herman and
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt.
</P>
<P>
   Former Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros, the former San Antonio
mayor, faces trial in February on charges stemming from an
independent counsel investigation surrounding his payments to a
former mistress. An independent counsel investigation of Commerce
Secretary Ron Brown ended with Brown's death in a 1996 plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   Smaltz charged Espy with violating federal law by accepting
$33,000 in free gifts and tickets to sporting events as well as
cash and air fare for his girlfriend from Sun-Diamond Growers
Cooperative, Tyson Foods Inc., Quaker Oats and Oglethorpe
Power/Smith Barney/EOP Group Inc. Espy's lawyers maintained that no
one received favorable treatment in exchange for the gifts and that
they fell under an exception for receiving gifts from friends.
</P>
<P>
   The ban on gratuities applied only to executive branch
officials. Members of Congress routinely received such gratuities
until a recent law change.
</P>
<P>
   Smatlz did not accuse Espy of accepting bribes and argued that
prosecutors need not prove that the corporations received any
favors in return for their gifts. In closing arguments, Smaltz also
told the jury, ``This case must be decided on the facts. It cannot
be decided on sympathy or politics or race.''
</P>
<P>
   Espy, like the majority of the jury, is black.
</P>
<P>
   But Espy's lawyer, Ted Wells, labeled the charges ``a bunch of
garbage'' and suggested prosecutors ``haven't even gotten close''
to proving their case. ``It has been a joke every day,'' Wells
charged. Defense attorneys called no witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some of the 70 prosecution witnesses testified over the
seven-week trial that Espy neither offered nor gave any special
treatment in return for gifts. Several testified they gave Espy
gifts out of long-standing friendships, not because of the
expectation of favors.
</P>
<P>
   Sun-Diamond lobbyist Richard Douglas testified that Espy sought
his advise on issues and they discussed in general issues affecting
Sun-Diamond. He testified that Espy did ask him to lie to the FBI
as the investigation began in 1994, but he said Espy never granted
favoritism to the cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas also said he felt badgered by Smaltz who threatened him
with 60 years in prison until he finally pleaded guilty to a
related case and became a ``puppet'' for the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 conviction against Sun-Diamond recently was overturned by
an appeals court but Smaltz has taken the issue to the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Espy, now practicing law in Jackson, Miss., was the first
Cabinet official to face trial since Labor Secretary Raymond
Donovan. Donovan, who served under President Reagan, was acquitted
in 1987 on charges stemming from business deals.
</P>
<P>
   Once a rising star within the Democratic Party, Espy was an
early supporter of Clinton's during the 1992 presidential campaign.
He was rewarded with the agriculture post, becoming the first
African American to hold that position.
</P>
<P>
   Espy also made vague suggestions that Clinton had made
additional promises to him should he be acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him then and there that I was not guilty of any of
these accusations. And I told him to his face and he made a promise
to me. He looked me in the eye and we talked and he made a promise
to me, and I would not reveal what he said. That was man to man,
person to person. So I'm hopeful that he'll keep that promise,''
Espy said of the president.

SNYDER KILLED WILDCATS' FIESTA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Sunday, you're likely to hear Kansas State coach Bill Snyder
being interviewed about how the Wildcats were jilted by the Fiesta
Bowl because they finished third in the final BCS poll.
</P>
<P>
   Listen closely to see if Snyder blames anyone. He should be able
to find an easy scapegoat: himself.
</P>
<P>
   But Snyder will surely find any other option preferable than
actually looking into a mirror. That would require humility.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats are 11-0, and probably the best overall team in the
country, in terms of balancing an explosive offense with a powerful
defense.
</P>
<P>
   That probably won't be enough to send the Wildcats to the Fiesta
Bowl, however, if Tennessee and UCLA win their season finales on
Saturday. Even a Wildcats victory over 10th-ranked Texas A&AMP;M
probably won't vault them from No. 3 to No. 2 in the BCS standings.
</P>
<P>
   And that's where Snyder fits in. His nonconference schedule of
Indiana State, Northern Illinois and Northeast Louisiana has
kneecapped Kansas State in the strength-of-schedule department.
</P>
<P>
   If Snyder had just played Indiana instead of Indiana State. Or
Illinois instead of Illinois State. Or Louisiana State instead of
Northeast Louisiana. Kansas State would have beaten all those
teams, and its strength-of-schedule ranking would be a lot higher
than 62nd.
</P>
<P>
   Outscoring those three nonleague patsies 201-14 made fans happy
in September but proved damaging in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Snyder is playing it close to the vest this week,
concentrating on the Big 12 championship game against Texas A&AMP;M.
And don't even ask if the Wildcats need a four-touchdown victory to
vault past the Bruins or Vols.
</P>
<P>
   ``You probably create some problems for yourself if you think
that,'' Snyder said. ``A&AMP;M's too good to think winning by a
particular margin would help us. We want to do the things we do
well. Anything beyond that puts us in harm's way.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual in college football, for an honest reaction, you go to
a player.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played what they've scheduled us to play,'' linebacker
Jeff Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm, sounds like Snyder's the culprit on that one, which won't
make missing the Fiesta Bowl any easier to swallow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've worked hard all year to get to where we are,'' return
specialist David Allen said. ``We finished 11-0. Not to make the
national-championship game would be a big disappointment to us. . .
. All we can do is win out. If we do, something good might happen
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   In case you were wondering, Texas A&AMP;M is well aware the Wildcats
need a big margin of victory Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Kansas State) will be caught up in the BCS, and I
imagine they'll look to beat us pretty good,'' A&AMP;M quarterback
Randy McCown said. ``But we're a pretty good team.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Rising star: It didn't take long for Oregon State coach Mike
Riley to start getting courted by other schools. Riley was in talks
with Mississippi this week for the head job that eventually went to
Tennessee offensive coordinator David Cutliffe.
</P>
<P>
   __ Prediction: Everyone knows USC linebacker Chris Claiborne
will turn pro after the season. But the more surprising occurrence
will be when wide receiver R. Jay Soward follows his teammate to
the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   __ What injury?: Dave Plati, Colorado's director of athletic
media relations, acknowledged that quarterback Mike Moschetti
played in the Buffaloes' last two games despite suffering broken
ribs on Nov. 7 at Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Plati said Colorado didn't release news of Moschetti's second
rib injury _ he suffered separated rib cartilage earlier in the
season _ to the media because the player did not want it disclosed.
If the school acted otherwise, Plati contended, it would be in
violation of the privacy act that covers all students.
</P>
<P>
   He also said reporting the most recent injury ``would have put
more of a bull's eye'' on Moschetti, who suffered 38 of this
season's 47 sacks. Moschetti, a junior college transfer from Mount
San Antonio College, started every game but did not finish four.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about Moschetti's injury first appeared on the
Internet, prompting Colorado's denials.
</P>
<P>
   __ Worried Wildcats: Sixth-ranked Arizona is concerned that it
will be bypassed by the Rose Bowl if UCLA is selected for the

FORMER AGRICULTURE CHIEF ESPY FOUND NOT GUILTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a four-year investigation by an independent
counsel that cost taxpayers $17 million, the corruption trial of
former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy drew to a dramatic close
Wednesday with a string of 30 not-guilty verdicts.
</P>
<P>
   The federal jury's verdict, following nine hours of
deliberation, cleared Espy of charges that he illegally accepted
$33,000 worth of trips, tickets to sporting events and other gifts
from companies regulated by his department.
</P>
<P>
   News of the ruling ripped through Washington's political
establishment, which for more than a year has been riveted by
scandal, the prerogatives of special prosecutors and the power of
money in politics.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict, moreover, delivered a blow to the
independent-counsel statute, which is at the heart of the
impeachment struggle on Capitol Hill, even as it alarmed
self-proclaimed citizen watchdog groups who vowed to redouble their
fight to restrict the flow of special interest money into the
pockets of government officials.
</P>
<P>
   Legal observers across the political spectrum agreed that the
case for the first time legalizes gift-giving to Cabinet executives
as long as a quid pro quo cannot be proven, setting a new _ and
some say dangerous _ precedent making it more difficult to prove
official corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Espy, 45, an African-American and former member of Congress from
Mississippi, was appointed in 1993 to the Cabinet and was widely
considered a rising star in the Clinton administration until he was
forced to resign in 1994 amid concerns that he was under a legal
cloud of suspicion for frequent socializing with farm company
executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to thank the Lord for this tremendous, absolute and
total victory,'' said Espy, outside the courthouse. ``It's cost a
lot, it's been tough but I knew from day one that I would stand
here before you completely exonerated.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton issued a statement saying he was pleased with
the verdict. ``After what have been challenging times for Mr. Espy,
both personally and professionally, I am heartened that he has, as
he said, emerged from this ordeal stronger. I hope that as he moves
forward he will continue his notable record of service to the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Espy wasted no time denouncing Independent Counsel Donald
Smaltz, who was appointed to investigate allegations that Espy took
football tickets, travel and other gifts from Tyson Food Inc.
Smaltz eventually widened the investigation to include other
companies.
</P>
<P>
   After accusing Smaltz of lying about the gifts he was alleged to
have received when he was secretary, Espy characterized the
independent counsel as one who has ``all the money, all the power,
very little supervision, and no timetable to unleash powerful
hordes of prosecutors upon you and your family'' _ echoing
criticism aimed at Kenneth W. Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Under the independent counsel statute, Starr also has spent four
years on his investigation of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``This helps doom the independent counsel statute . . .,'' said
Frank Mankiewicz, vice chairman of the public relations firm Hill &AMP;
Knowlton, and a Democratic activist who was once Robert F.
Kennedy's press secretary. ``Smaltz made Ken Starr look like a
legal genius.''
</P>
<P>
   Smaltz, who has in the past charged that the Justice Department
was stonewalling his efforts, said, ``We met our obligation and the
jury has spoken.''
</P>
<P>
   Espy admitted to ``ethical lapses in judgment'' in comments
following the verdict, and his lawyers never explicitly denied that
their client accepted some of the gifts. They did, however,
conclude that the government's case was so weak they would not have
to put Espy on the stand or offer any witnesses in his defense.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the prosecution's witnesses actually strengthened Espy's
case, legal observers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prosecution's witnesses were abysmal,'' said William B.
Canfield, who, as a partner at the law firm of Williams and Jensen
has represented many members of the House and Senate charged with
ethics violations. ``They tended to side with Espy and say the
gifts were made in friendship and that he did nothing on their
behalf.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution tried to show that Espy sought out or accepted
gifts from lobbyists including tickets to the 1994 Super Bowl, a
Chicago Bulls playoff game and a US Tennis Open match, as well as
free airline tickets for a woman friend.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law prohibits excessive gift giving, except from
friends. Espy's lawyers claimed many of the gifts were allowable
under the exception.
</P>
<P>
   The key to understanding the verdict, Canfield said, is to see
that the jurors made a distinction between an ethical lapse and
bribery, or a violation of the law.
</P>
<P>
   The law up to now has been understood as prohibiting officials
from receiving gifts as long as the gifts are given because of the
official's status and duties. Under this interpretation of the law,
it would have been enough for Smaltz to prove simply that Espy
received gifts from individuals whose businesses he regulated.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the judge interpreted the law narrowly, telling the
jury Smaltz had to prove there was a quid pro quo for the gifts. In
other words, Smaltz had to show that Espy, as a result of receiving
gifts from companies he regulated, made policy decisions or took
actions on behalf of these companies whose representatives had
bought him tickets, vacations and other gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Such a narrow interpretation, said lawyers and citizen's groups,
means that it will be harder to make corruption cases against
officials in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It deals a blow to the independent counsel statute and to the
theory that you can impose strict liability on Cabinet officials
for accepting gifts under the gratuity statute,'' said Stanley
Brand, who frequently defends public officials in court as a lawyer
with the Washington law firm Brand, Lowell, and Ryan. ``Clearly
more has to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   What it does, said Gary Ruskin, director of the Congressional
Accountability Project, is legitimize the ``graft culture'' of
political Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, reject the entire premise of the case and point
to the verdict as evidence that the man who was unfairly targeted
has finally been vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole thing was crazy,'' said Mankiewicz.

DEATH-ROW ESCAPE LEAVES TEXAS OFFICIALS GUESSING

<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ Martin Gurule hid on the roof of his death
row prison until after midnight, dropped to the ground, clambered
over two razor-tipped fences, slipped through a crease in the
space-time continuum and disappeared into the eighth dimension.
</P>
<P>
   It is as good an explanation as any.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old inmate, awaiting lethal injection for the 1992
murder of a Corpus Christi restaurant owner and his cook during a
robbery, has been the subject of one of the most intensive manhunts
that Texas prison officials have ever mounted. Six days ago, he
became the first death row prisoner in Texas to escape in 64 years.
</P>
<P>
   But while prison officials said they were convinced that Gurule
was still hiding in the 17,000 wooded acres surrounding the
prison's Ellis Unit, 15 miles northeast of Huntsville, they
acknowledged that they really did not know where he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say _ and I am choosing my words very carefully _ that
we have no hard evidence that he is anywhere outside of those
woods,'' said Glen Castlebury, a spokesman for the Texas Department
of Criminal Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any hard evidence that Gurule is still in the woods?
Castlebury tugged at the bill of his hat, which read ``Don't Mess
With Texas,'' and shrugged. ``I told you I was choosing my words
carefully,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said that while they had received several reports of
Elvis-like sightings of Gurule throughout the state in recent days,
none of the leads had panned out.
</P>
<P>
   And there have been no reports of stolen vehicles or food or
weapons in or near the Huntsville area.
</P>
<P>
   The roads surrounding the wooded acres had police officers
posted every hundred yards or so. They were still there Wednesday,
some of them sitting on lawn chairs beside smoking campfires.
Deeper in the woods, officers with dogs and others on horseback
picked their way through the dense piney thickets. Others patrolled
the nearby Trinity River by boat, and still others hovered overhead
in at least three helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   The escape continued to have repercussions Wednesday on the
Texas prison system, where officials suspended the work program
that allowed Gurule access to a recreation yard from which he made
his escape. State officials also announced the appointment of a
commission to investigate the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas had an unusual program where death row prisoners were
allowed to work in a confined and secure factory adjacent to their
cell block,'' said Ned Benton, a professor of public administration
at John Jay College of Criminal Justice at City University of New
York and a former director of the Oklahoma Department of
Corrections. ``I don't know that the program was implicated in the
escape, but I think they intend to evaluate that.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed they do. Wayne Scott, executive director of the criminal
justice department, said Texas prison officials never liked the
death row work program, but were forced to carry it out after a
court case involving charges of overcrowding and poor conditions.
</P>
<P>
   All 453 death row inmates in Texas are housed in the Ellis Unit.
All but about 150 of them are kept locked in their cells 23 hours a
day, allowed only one hour of supervised exercise and recreation.
The others, though, have qualified for the work program, either
doing jobs around the prison (Gurule was a janitor) or, as most of
them do, making pants for prison guards at a factory attached to
their prison block. And all of the inmates deemed ``work capable''
were also allowed several hours in the outdoor recreation yard each
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``In prison, it's always a carrot-and-stick kind of thing,''
Fitzgerald said. ``It's like you use television sets or exercise
equipment as a management device to get them to act like good
inmate citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for the Texas work program, an inmate had to be on
death row for several months, during which time there were no
behavioral problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was most definitely the case with Gurule,'' said
Castlebury. ``Until 12:20 a.m. last Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   That is when Gurule and six other death row inmates dropped off
the roof and were sighted by a guard. Guards in two towers 200 feet
away from the men began to shoot and all of them, except Gurule,
surrendered. Gurule kept running and made it over the two fences
and into the woods.
</P>
<P>
   Castlebury said the authorities found some blood spots near
where Gurule made his escape. ``We don't know whether he caught
some flesh on that razor wire or whether he was nicked by one of
the shots,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The manhunt began before dawn on Friday. Prison officials set up
a seven-mile perimeter around the prison, blocking the handful of
roads leading into the remote area and searching through the brush
with dogs.
</P>
<P>
   In the early hours of the search, authorities emphasized the
rugged nature of the surrounding terrain, which they said made
searching difficult but also provided an inhospitable landscape for
the fleeing inmate. By Tuesday, however, authorities began to
emphasize the ways in which the inmate could still be surviving in
the wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hunting country around there and there are all sorts of
duck blinds and deer camps where he might have found shelter,''
Castlebury said. Often, hunters stock their camps with canned food,
so he could be sitting out there, right now, over a dinner of pork
and beans.
</P>
<P>
   There are some poisonous snakes and a few alligators in the
area, which might have ended Gurule's flight. Another possibility,
Castlebury said, is that the escaped inmate has succumbed to
whatever injuries had caused those blood splotches.
</P>
<P>
   The one chilling possibility that the authorities do not like to
consider is that Gurule somehow managed to get to a road, flag down
a car and convince the driver to take him somewhere _ and that
perhaps he is out there now with a hostage.
</P>
<P>
   Searchers decided to alter their tactics early Wednesday,
changing from a policy of constantly stalking the woods with dogs
and horses to making only occasional and random searches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we're trying to lure him out, to sucker him, to
give him the idea that we're pulling out,'' Castlebury said. ``We
want to get him to move. As soon as he moves, we got him.''
</P>
<P>
   By late Wednesday, though, there was no sign of movement.

ESPY ACQUITTED OF ALL CORRUPTION CHARGES BROUGHT BY INDEPENDENT
COUNSEL

 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After only two days of deliberation, a federal jury
on Wednesday acquitted Mike Espy, the former agriculture secretary,
of corruption charges, ending an independent prosecutor's four-year
investigation of Espy's acceptance of sports tickets and other
favors from companies he was supposed to regulate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cost a lot, it's been tough but I knew from day one that
I would stand here before you completely exonerated,'' Espy, a
former congressman and once a rising star in the Democratic Party,
told reporters outside the courthouse. The jury took barely 10
hours to reject 30 counts brought by Donald Smaltz, an independent
prosecutor. The trial judge had earlier dismissed eight other
counts.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he savored his swift and thorough redemption, Espy made
it clear he was among the critics who point to each such verdicts
as a judgment of the independent counsel law under which he was
prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is expected to hold hearings early next year on whether
to renew the law, which expires in June. There is little
expectation that it will be extended as many public officials in
both parties, wearied by high-profile investigations from
Iran-Contra to Whitewater, seem opposed to the law.
</P>
<P>
   Espy made it plain that when Congress holds hearings, he hoped
his ordeal would seal the law's fate. ``I would like to be the
first witness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Espy likened Smaltz who spent more than $17 million
investigating him over a four-year period to a ``schoolyard
bully.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Espy and Smaltz, in comments to reporters after the
verdict, neatly crystallized the debate over the wisdom and
effectiveness of the Ethics in Government Act, the post-Watergate
law that provides for independent counsels to investigate
allegations of wrongdoing against senior administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   The independent prosecutor, Espy said, was ``someone with all
the money, all the power, very little supervision, no timetable and
able to unleash powerful hordes of prosecutors on you and your
family,'' summarizing the arguments that will be heard in Congress
from the law's opponents.
</P>
<P>
   After Espy and his jubilant family departed, Smaltz appeared and
first told reporters that he accepted the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   But then, in his prepared statement, Smaltz appeared to continue
to argue the case he had just lost, saying: ``A public official's
acceptance of gratuities goes to the heart of the credibility in
the performance of his duties. When a public official accepts
gratuities, it calls the impartial execution of his judgment into
question when he has matters before him that affect the gratuity
givers.''
</P>
<P>
   William Noakes, an associate independent counsel, said that with
the conclusion of the Espy trial, Smaltz's office has only a few
matters remaining and will soon close up shop.
</P>
<P>
   Smaltz took the opportunity to offer a both a valedictory and a
defense of his work, saying that his office had achieved more than
a dozen convictions and garnered some $11 million in fines and
criminal penalties, mostly from companies that were charged with
giving illegal gratuities to Espy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our investigation and prosecutions dissuade corporations
from giving gifts to their regulators, and the regulators from
accepting gifts from those who are regulated, I believe that the
costs we have incurred are worth the price,'' Smaltz said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that despite the acquittal, there was value in
prosecuting Espy because it would discourage other officials from
behaving the same way. ``The actual indictment of a public official
may in fact be as great a deterrent as a conviction of that
official,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his tenure, Smaltz had been the target of critics who
complained that he personified the problems with the independent
counsel law, that he was excessively ambitious and eager to expand
his jurisdiction beyond his original mandate. At times, he faced
even more criticism than Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel for
Whitewater matters who has told Congress that President Clinton may
have committed impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks after his appointment in September 1994, Smaltz
stunned many in official Washington when he subpoenaed flight logs
and notes of pilots working for Tyson's Foods, a large poultry and
food processor based in Arkansas whose owner, Don Tyson, has been a
longtime patron of Clinton. He was trying to find out if Tyson had
arranged for cash bribes to be ferried to Clinton when he was
governor of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   When lawyers from Tyson's protested that none of the matters
were within Smaltz's jurisdiction, a federal judge agreed and
ordered Smaltz to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Smaltz also suffered a setback when a federal judge threw out
charges he had brought against Henry Espy, Espy's brother, saying
they were unrelated to the prosecutor's mandate.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Smaltz has had successes as well. His two most notable
victories were having Tyson's Foods agree to pay $6 million after
pleading guilty to making illegal gifts to Espy. He also got Sun
Diamond Growers, a California cooperative for growers of nuts,
raisins and other dried fruits to pay a $1.5 million fine for
illegally condoning gifts to Espy by its lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   But a federal appeals court in Washington overturned the
conviction of Sun Diamond and the case is on appeal to the
U.S.Supreme Court, one of the remaining items of business for
Smaltz's office. The case involves the meaning of the unlawful
gratuity statute, which makes it a crime to give, offer or promise
``anything of value'' to a public official ``because of any
official act performed or to be performed.''
</P>
<P>
   Smaltz had argued that the law was violated anytime a gift was
motivated by the recipient's official position.
</P>
<P>
   But in overturning the conviction last March, the Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said the gift had to
be motivated not only by the recipient's position, but by some
official act, either a reward for a past act, or an inducement for
a future one.
</P>
<P>
   Espy was charged with violating the same statute, receiving an
illegal gratuity. In presenting 70 witnesses over nearly two
months, Smaltz portrayed Espy as eager to ask companies he
regulated for hard-to-get tickets to sporting events, including the
U.S. Open tennis tournament, and games played by the Dallas Cowboys
football team and the Chicago Bulls basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   Espy was not charged with bribery but under the gratuity law,
with taking about $34,000 worth of tickets and other favors like
luggage. Espy did not take the stand and presented no witnesses in
his defense, resting his case after the prosecution presented 70
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Wells, one of Espy's lawyers, sought to demolish Smaltz's
case during closing argument to the jury that the prosecution
presented no witnesses who testified his client ever made a
decision based on anything he ever received. He said that many of
the gifts Espy received were the result of longstanding friendships
with people who were lobbyists and that the law allowed federal
officials to accept items in those circumstances.

ADMIRAL ACCEPTS PUNISHMENT FOR STEERING CONTRACTS TO LOVER
</HEADLINE>
   (htv) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A one-star Navy admiral accepted a finding of guilt
Wednesday on charges that he improperly steered military contracts
to his partner in an adulterous affair. He agreed to early
retirement at a substantially reduced pension and to penalties
including 30 days of house arrest, Navy officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, Rear Adm. John Scudi, 54, effectively pleaded no
contest to the charges at a closed administrative hearing in
Norfolk, Va., which was a less severe alternative to a criminal
investigation and precluded any possibility of a court-martial and
prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The disposition of Scudi's case through administrative means, as
opposed to criminal proceedings, allowed the Navy to bring a quick,
quiet end to a matter that might have caused it sustained
embarrassment and scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations against Scudi, a graduate of the U.S. Naval
Academy who had served in the Navy for more than three decades,
followed a string of high-profile adultery cases in the armed
forces in recent years and heated debates over the military's
handling of accusations of adultery.
</P>
<P>
   Several experts on military justice and several Navy officials
who spoke on condition of anonymity said that Scudi's punishment
was in fact more severe than that meted out to most officers
accused of adultery. They said that the Navy was sending a clear
signal that it did not coddle high-ranking officers accused of
ethical violations.
</P>
<P>
   Comdr. John Singley, a Navy spokesman in Norfolk, Va., stressed
the severe financial toll of Scudi's agreement to request a
retirement at the rank of captain as opposed to admiral. If the
secretary of the Navy approves that request _ a formality at this
point _ Scudi's annual pension of $60,240 would be $17,700 less
than he might otherwise have received.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is hardly a slap on the wrist,'' Singley said. ``This
represents a significant economic loss.''
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Maginnis, a retired Army colonel who works as a
senior policy adviser for the Family Research Council, a
conservative group, said that the private administrative hearing
was a convenient, easy way for the Navy to deflect further
attention and humiliation.

   ``It's a black eye removed, and this guy gets off fairly
lightly,'' Maginnis said. ``I think it's very light. The Navy is
setting another bad precedent by demonstrating that the higher up
you are, the less accountable you are. We've sent people to
Leavenworth for far less than this.''
</P>
<P>
   Maginnis said he was speaking in particular about accusations
that Scudi, who worked at the Navy's headquarters in the Pentagon
as the director of the its offices of privatization and base
management, steered about $150,000 in contracts over several years
to a woman with whom he was having an adulterous affair. Scudi is
married.
</P>
<P>
   Scudi's lawyer, Kevin Barry, did not return a message left on
his telephone answering machine Wednesday night. Navy officials
said Wednesday that Scudi has repeatedly declined requests to be
interviewed. They said he started serving his house arrest
Wednesday in the bachelor quarters at the National Naval Medical
Center in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Within the military system, adultery is usually prosecuted only
when it accompanies other accusations of criminal wrongdoing, and
the cases are usually handled as discreetly as possible.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Other prosecutions involving adultery have come to varied ends.
In 1995, Navy Rear Adm. Ralph Tindal was found guilty in a
non-criminal Navy inquiry of being involved in a yearlong affair
with a female enlisted aide and received virtually the same
punishment as Scudi.
</P>
<P>
   In an even more widely publicized case, First Lt. Kelly Flinn,
the Air Force's first female B-52 pilot, dropped her request for an
honorable discharge and agreed to a general discharge as a way of
avoiding a court-martial and a possible prison sentence on charges
including adultery and lying to senior officers. The general
discharge rendered her ineligible for pension and veterans benefits
and required her to pay back $18,000 in costs of her education at
the Air Force Academy.
</P>
<P>
   In Scudi's case, Navy officials did not have to offer him an
administrative hearing but could have proceeded directly to a grand
jury-style proceeding to determine whether enough evidence existed
for a court-martial. For his part, Scudi could have rejected the
administrative hearing and pressed for a court-martial, where he
would have been allowed to mount a more vigorous defense.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on military law said that both Navy officials and Scudi
would have been taking a risk if they had gone to a court-martial,
where either side could have lost its case. If convicted of all
charges, he could have faced dismissal, a loss of pay and benefits
and a maximum of 11 and a half years in prison.

ISRAELI CABINET SUSPENDS LAND TRANSFERS, DEMANDS PALESTINIANS DROP
PLANS TO DECLARE STATEHOOD 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Casting doubt on the latest Middle East peace
agreement, Israel's Cabinet Wednesday suspended further West Bank
land transfers to the Palestinians until they concede to a list of
demands, including the makeup of prisoner releases and plans to
declare statehood.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis insist that under the terms of the October Wye
accords, they are allowed to release criminal as well as political
prisoners. The Palestinians say the agreement refers to political
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   The Cabinet also asked for a renewed pledge from Palestinian
leaders to refrain from encouraging violence against Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, speaking
to supporters in Washington, reiterated his intention to establish
an independent state in the West Bank and Gaza in May 1999, the
date interim peace agreements are set to expire.
</P>
<P>
   The Cabinet action also followed a day of violence in the West
Bank, when an angry mob of Palestinians protesting Israel's refusal
to release political prisoners beat an Israeli soldier, and in
Jerusalem, when a Palestinian man was stabbed to death by an
extremist Jew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel demands that the Palestinian Authority announce clearly
that it is abandoning its intention to declare a Palestinian state
and announce its commitment to continuous negotiations until a
final arrangement is achieved,'' said a statement released by the
prime minister's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel demands that the Palestinian Authority stop violent and
inciteful acts and punishes rioters,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is committed under the terms of an agreement signed in
October to turn over 13 percent of West Bank territory to
Palestinians by the end of January. Last month, Israeli troops
withdrew from the first 2 percent of that total.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that there will be no further withdrawals
unless the Palestinian Authority lives up to all its commitments,''
Netanyahu's spokesman, David Bar-Illan told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the Clinton administration was sharply critical
of the new Israeli conditions and said the accord ``should be
implemented as signed.''
</P>
<P>
   This latest blowup comes less than two weeks before President
Bill Clinton is due to visit Palestinian-ruled Gaza to attend a
session of the Palestine National Council. At that time the ruling
body is supposed to reiterate its commitment to annul parts of its
charter Israel considers offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians reacted angrily to the Cabinet decision and accused
Israel of looking for excuses to postpone the transfer of West Bank
land to Palestinian control and to disrupt Clinton's trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is absolutely unacceptable,'' said top Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat. ``We have an agreement. We should respect
it, honor it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that this decision doesn't affect Clinton's trip here
and I hope it is not directed against that trip, to disrupt it,''
Erekat said. ``We really urge the Israelis to refrain from such
policies and such steps.''
</P>
<P>
   For several days, Palestinians have protested, sometimes
violently, to Israel's inclusion of 150 common criminals when it
freed 250 prisoners last month. Under the terms of the agreement
negotiated in October at the Wye River conference center, Israel is
to free 750 prisoners over three months.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians say all of those released should be political
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Israel says some of them can be common criminals and that it
will not release prisoners belonging to Hamas, a militant
organization opposed to peacemaking, or those with ``blood on their
hands''
</P>
<P>
   ``The agreement should be implemented in accordance with the
criteria specified in the annex,'' said Erekat. ``The annex said
Israel should release political prisoners.''
</P>
<P>
   Protests outside the West Bank town of Ramallah turned violent
when a car carrying an Israeli soldier and civilian passed by. A
mob attacked the car, bashed the soldier's head repeatedly with
rocks, and yelled ``Yehudi, Yehudi'' _-Arabic for ``Jew.''
</P>
<P>
   After the soldier and the civilian fled, the mob set the car on
fire. Soldiers who arrived on the scene used tear gas and rubber
bullets to quell the rioters.
</P>
<P>
   The soldier, Assaf Miara, was hospitalized with head injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The attack, captured on film, caused an uproar in Israel. The
Cabinet blamed the Palestinian government for failing to curb the
unrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's violent incident near Ramallah reflects a grave
deterioration in security for which Israel holds the Palestinian
Authority responsible,'' the Cabinet said.
</P>
<P>
   The incident overshadowed the morning murder of a Palestinian
worker, Osama Natshe, 41 and a father of six, who was stabbed to
death while walking to work in the mixed Jerusalem neighborhood of
Abu Tor.
</P>
<P>
   Natshe's murder is the second fatal attack in a series of
assaults on Arabs in Jerusalem, which police believe were carried
out by a Jew for nationalist reasons. At the scene of Wednesday's
attack, police found evidence that they said showed that the
attacker was Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   During the funeral procession in east Jerusalem, Palestinians
threw stones at Israeli soldiers, who responded by shooting tear
gas canisters and rubber-coated metal bullets at the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's violence follows a candlelight vigil held on Tuesday
by the children of Palestinian prisoners. During a speech at the
event, Palestinian leaders vowed to keep up pressure on Israel to
release political detainees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leadership that threw stones is ready to return and use
stones to free the people,'' said Ahmed Qurie, the Palestinian
speaker of the legislative council, or parliament, better known as
Abu Ala.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd responded with the chant, ``Stones will turn into
Kalashnikovs, '' meaning rifles.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Israel's Cabinet called on Palestinians to stop
what it said were threats to achieve their goals by force.
</P>
<P>
   ``All acts of violence, threats of violence and Abu Ala's
threats of violence must cease,'' it said.

CONSERVATIVES ABANDON HOPE OF SEEING CLINTON FALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also IMPEACH) 
(mk) 
 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even as the House Judiciary Committee moves to
expand its impeachment inquiry, a growing number of conservatives
are coming to terms with what they increasingly see as the painful
and galling reality that President Clinton will keep his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of anyone who still thinks he'll be removed from
office,'' said the conservative writer Arianna Huffington. She said
attempts by congressional Republicans to shift the focus to a
perjury charge and Clinton's campaign finances would probably not
change anything. ``It's too late,'' Ms. Huffington said.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean the pressure on Republicans in Congress to
forge ahead with impeachment proceedings has eased. On the
contrary, there is enormous pressure to proceed as aggressively as
possible, both for the political purpose of satisfying the party's
conservative base and out of the philosophical belief that fighting
on, even to almost certain defeat, is the right thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   But while virtually no one on the right believes Clinton should
remain in office, most conservatives have quietly, grudgingly given
up any real hope that he will be ousted. At this point, the revised
goal of many conservatives is simply to lose with honor.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Kristol, editor of the conservative Weekly Standard, said
his magazine would certainly continue pressing Congress to impeach
the president _ but then he mocked the improbability of his own
position. ``Some of us are hanging tough in our obdurate blindness
to the political reality,'' Kristol said, with a grim laugh. ``I'm
like one of these Japanese soldiers after World War II. It's 1949
and I'm on some island not knowing the war is over.''
</P>
<P>
   But already, he is focused less on the outcome of the fight than
the integrity of the process, and he seems most concerned that
Republicans fulfill what he sees as the conservative duty to uphold
the rule of law and the Constitution. ``The thing I want more than
anything is a real debate, real consideration of whether he should
be impeached,'' Kristol said. ``The Congress owes the American
people that, even if they don't know they're owed that. Even if
Clinton slips the noose, I think it's important that conservatives
not accede to Clintonism as victorious. You can't re-litigate
Clinton, but you can continue the conversation while looking beyond
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristol said there is a split between conservatives who want to
go through the motions of impeachment as quickly as possible and
those who intend to fight to the last, no matter the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   But even some in that latter group seem a little weary. William
Bennett, author of ``The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the
Assault on American Ideals'' (Free Press), sounded
uncharacteristically humbled by the mystery of how it is that most
Americans remain relatively undisturbed by Clinton's
transgressions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may have been wrong,'' in thinking that the public would
eventually react, or would hold future presidential candidates to a
higher moral standard as a result of the Clinton scandals, said
Bennett, who was nursing a bad cold and sounded downright dejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure enough people care,'' he said. ``For the first
time in my adult life, I'm not in sync. I don't get it. What about
all these conferences I've been invited to? I mean, values,
schmalues. I don't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett says he still believes there is a 50-50 chance that the
president will be impeached in the House, but trailed off
mid-sentence without bothering to finish answering a question about
what might then happen in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, the debate is, if anything, still heating up. But
the Republican strategist Ralph Reed said he and others were
already focusing on the aftermath of the inevitable failure of
congressional Republicans to remove Clinton from office. ``They
have to make it clear that this was a reluctant duty, kind of like
settling the estate of a deceased parent,'' Reed said. ``You do it,
move on and you're fine. You don't look like you're enjoying it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Huffington said she and many other conservatives felt forced
to concede defeat after the special prosecutor Kenneth W. Starr
``not only failed to connect the dots of presidential abuses but
removed two of the major dots, Travelgate and Filegate.''
</P>
<P>
   She was speaking of the dismissal of White House travel office
employees and the improper gathering of FBI files of government
officials in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   She said she hoped that Clinton would be tried for perjury after
his term expired.
</P>
<P>
   Wait. Is there anyone on the right who still believes Clinton
might be removed from office? ``No,'' Reed said without any
hesitation. ``Not to my knowledge. We're starting to focus our
energy and efforts where it belongs and that's with Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   There is not, of course, universal agreement among
conservatives, particularly the rank and file, on this point. G.
Gordon Liddy, for example, says listeners to his radio show seemed
almost ready to give up but got mad all over again after Clinton
responded to questions posed by the House Judiciary Committee in
terms they saw as legalistic hair-splitting.
</P>
<P>
   But throughout the conservative movement there are indications
that many have nonetheless begun to look beyond the current efforts
to impeach Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A banner headline in a recent issue of the conservative
newspaper Human Events was ``Think President'' but the text didn't
concern Clinton at all; It referred to the 2000 elections. ``The
next two years will determine whether the conservative movement
returns victorious to the pinnacle of power or is once again sent
into the wilderness.'' the front-page editorial said. ``Everything
rides on the outcome of the 2000 Presidential elections.''
</P>
<P>
   The editor of Human Events, Terence Jeffrey, insisted that good
conservatives would never give up on impeaching a president who in
their view has repeatedly flouted the rule of law. But Jeffrey,
too, acknowledged that ``I don't think there is any realistic
chance they'll find the votes in the Senate to remove'' him.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Susan Carpenter McMillan, a conservative activist and sometime
spokeswoman for Paula Corbin Jones, whose sexual harassment suit
against the president brought Clinton's liaison with Monica
Lewinsky to light, said she had already reconciled herself to the
likelihood that Clinton would probably be around for two more
years.
</P>
<P>
   She said, ``I've finally just come to accept that this must just
be God's will that nothing is going to happen to this man.''
</P>
<P>
   Even among those conservatives who do not seem to have lost
heart entirely, there have been at least incremental
acknowledgments that Clinton may well survive. Speaking
specifically about the Travelgate and Filegate investigations, the
conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh told one caller to his radio
show recently that ``It makes me sad to hear you'' clinging to the
hope that those matters might still bring Clinton down. Limbaugh
urged the caller more than once to ``move on.''
</P>
<P>
   R. Emmett Tyrrell, editor of the American Spectator and author
of ``The Impeachment of William Jefferson Clinton'' (Regnery), said
he, for one, was not ready to do that just yet. And even if this
particular impeachment effort fails, he said, Clinton might yet
provide his critics with some new material.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other scandals could pop up at any moment,'' he said
hopefully. ``If he gets out of this one, who doubts that in six
months there could be something else?''

SAFETY COMMISSION ADVISES DISCARDING OF VINYL PACIFIERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Saying that it could not be certain of the risk to
babies from a material found in vinyl that causes cancer in rats,
the Consumer Product Safety Commission advised parents Wednesday to
throw away nipples and pacifiers made of vinyl and asked
manufacturers to stop using it in objects that children put into
their mouths.
</P>
<P>
   But because laboratory tests cannot measure how much of the
chemicals babies are likely to ingest when they chew on vinyl
objects, officials said they did not have enough evidence to try to
ban the material. They were not even sure how long a baby typically
chews on a pacifier or toy, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The chemical, called DINP, turns vinyl from a hard plastic
suitable for products like water pipes into the soft plastic used
for children's toys. In the mid-1980s the commission urged toy
manufacturers to switch to DINP from DEHP, another kind of
softener, because lab studies found that DEHP caused cancer and
other maladies in rats and mice; more recently, DINP has been shown
to have similar effects.
</P>
<P>
   Industry scientists say both materials are safe.
</P>
<P>
   In a study released Wednesday, the safety commission said that
``few, if any, children are at risk from liver or other organ
toxicity.'' Ronald Medford, the commission's assistant executive
director, said more work was needed, including a review by an
expert panel and a study to ``get a better handle on length of time
kids mouth the stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Medford said his agency had begun in October to ask
manufacturers to stop using the material, and nearly all have done
so, at least for objects intended to go in the mouth, like
teethers, rattles and nipples. Nearly all are now made of other
materials, like latex. But some Gerber Clear and Soft pacifiers and
nipples still on the market are made of vinyl, he said.

EXXON AND MOBIL LACK ANTITRUST TARGET-MAKING INGREDIENT: A
ROCKEFELLER 
</HEADLINE>
  (With EXXON-TEXACO.) 
(th) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Newly reunited, Exxon and Mobil might have some of the heft of
Standard Oil, their forefather company that once dominated the
American oil industry. But they do not have the old chutzpah. The
proposed colossus lacks one thing that made Standard Oil the prime
target of antitrust crusaders and muckraking journalists: a
Rockefeller.
</P>
<P>
   Even before President Theodore Roosevelt's antitrust campaign
finally shattered Standard Oil into 34 pieces in 1911, John D.
Rockefeller, the founder, had retired from management.
</P>
<P>
   Today, many of his 140 descendants have small shareholdings in
Exxon, Mobil and other cousins of the Standard Oil family, but none
has significant stakes or exercises control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that any member of my family has been involved
in the oil industry for almost a century,'' says David Rockefeller,
a soft-spoken third-generation scion and a somewhat reluctant
spokesman for the family's petroleum industry patrimony. ``We have
all gone on to other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Rockefeller descendants who still carry the family name, John
D. Rockefeller's only son, John Jr., became a leader in
philanthropy. Of John Jr.'s children _ David's generation _ two
became bankers and investors, two went into politics, and one, John
III, spent most of his life giving away money made by his
grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   So, if the Justice Department decides to challenge the
Exxon-Mobil merger on antitrust grounds, it might find the target
less tempting than Rockefeller's Standard Oil.
</P>
<P>
   John D. Rockefeller personified the trust kings of the Gilded
Age, who accumulated unprecedented and to this day unmatched power
over key industries like oil, steel and railroads. Faced with the
Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, Rockefeller was brash, removed and
defiant. He was in the popular mind the plutocrat who inspired an
activist government role in regulating big business.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Chernow, author of ``Titan,'' a biography of the elder
Rockefeller, compares the Standard Oil founder to Bill Gates,
chairman of Microsoft, which is currently the target of an
antitrust lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Both created dominant companies from scratch, drove rivals out
of business through aggressive pricing, and innovated relentlessly
to maintain their franchises. In both cases, the government
attacked the methods of the individual businessman as a core part
of the threat posed by the companies, Chernow said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the main reasons for the break up of Standard Oil was
John D. Rockefeller. He was Standard Oil and Standard Oil was John
D. Rockefeller,'' Chernow said. ``It was much easier for the
government to attack a company that had a face attached to it.
Exxon and Mobil today is a faceless bureaucracy. It's leaders don't
inspire the same emotion from the general public.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said for the Rockefeller clan itself, whose
modern reputation is anything but antagonistic. David Rockefeller
is a good example. Now 83 years old, he is not the oldest living
Rockefeller. But he has become a public leader for fellow heirs.
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller was chairman of Chase Manhattan Bank, where he
worked for 35 years, and an international businessman who
cultivated relations with royalty, power and wealth on every
continent. He is famous for his rolodex, which he has said contains
in excess of 100,000 business cards.
</P>
<P>
   He has a personal secretary to manage his contacts. Rockefeller
is currently at work writing memoirs from a life that has little to
do with oil, though the book will recount his impressions of his
grandfather and family history.
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller's father, John Jr., wound down the family's role in
the oil industry in the 1920s and 1930s. Many oil shares were sold
to fund the construction of the massive Rockefeller Center office
complex in midtown Manhattan, which consumed a great deal of the
family's wealth and did not return profits in John Jr.'s lifetime,
David Rockefeller said.
</P>
<P>
   But David, through his role as one of America's leading
corporate bankers as well as a continuing minority shareholder, has
kept tabs on developments and both Exxon and Mobil, and he finds
the rationale for the merger compelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both companies are well managed and Exxon particularly is
among the half dozen best managed companies in the country, I
think, if you look at return on equity and social responsibility,''
Rockefeller said in an interview. ``But in this environment of
dramatically declining prices and changing competitive picture,
this made sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Bringing together Exxon and Mobil reunites only four the 34
companies that made up the Standard Oil empire. But by value, it
recreates a much larger chunk. Chernow estimates that the
combination represents slightly more than half the assets of
Standard Oil in 1911, in part because Exxon and Mobil included
Standard Oil's large New York and New Jersey units.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rockefeller sees few antitrust implications from the
linkup. ``You could point to fact that this brings together some of
the companies that were broken up by efforts of Roosevelt, but it
is not recreating a monopoly position,'' Rockefeller said. ``While
the numbers are big, the impact in terms of antitrust in my mind is
not a threat.''
</P>
<P>
   A more unfortunate result of the merger, he said, will be the
loss of jobs at the two companies. ``It is always distressing to
see things of this kind resulting in unemployment for people, but
as percentage of total employees worldwide it is still small. And
frankly, we live in a world of modern technology. For companies to
be competitive, they have to take advantage of technology, which
often makes it possible to get the same output with fewer people.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller, a leading patron of New York's Museum of Modern
Art, said he is also aware of concerns that the Exxon-Mobil combine
will play a less creative role in charitable giving than the two,
especially Mobil, did as independent companies. But he said that
that's one place where his remaining oil industry influence can
still be brought to bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a risk that giving will decline, yes,'' Rockefeller
said. ``But as someone who is active in that area, I will try to
persuade them not to diminish their giving.''

JEWISH GROUP ACCUSES FRENCH OF HIDING STOLEN-ART RECORDS 
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON _ Facing an apprehensive audience, the World Jewish
Congress startled a private session of a 44-nation international
conference on Holocaust assets by saying it has already identified
1,700 artworks in 225 museums worldwide that it suspects may have
been looted by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Lauder, the chairman of the Congress' Committee on Art
Recovery, also accused the French government at the Tuesday session
of hiding records that would reveal the identities of Jews whose
looted artworks French museums now display. Lauder's charges were
disclosed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   And Wednesday, on the second day of the three-day conference,
British Lord Greville Janner raised an issue that the US hosts had
deliberately kept off the agenda because of its controversial
nature: slave labor.
</P>
<P>
   Janner, the chairman of Britain's Holocaust Education Trust,
cited 11 major companies, including Ford Motor Co.'s European
subsidiaries, and Daimler Benz, which just merged with Chrysler, as
having used slave labor from Nazi concentration camps during the
war.
</P>
<P>
   Ori Z. Soltes, chairman of the Holocaust Art Restitution Project
and a panelist Wednesday, scolded the conference organizers for
talking about the rights of art claimants, but refusing to invite
victims of looting or listen to their concerns, according to an
account provided to the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   The hopes of the US hosts, that the conference would be
relatively free of rancor, appear to have been dashed, leaving in
doubt whether the State Department can win consensus on a fairly
mild, non-binding agreement for the 44 countries to open their
archives and seek to match claimants with artworks that have been
missing for more than a half century.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal does not even call for the return of looted art,
only that ``steps be taken immediately to achieve a just and fair
solution.''
</P>
<P>
   When Secretary of State Madeleine Albright formally opened the
international conference on Holocaust assets on Tuesday, she urged
the delegates to ``work together constructively in an atmosphere
free from threats.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Dubrow, a State Department spokesman, said last night
that ``the discussions could certainly be described as frank. But
that shouldn't be a surprise, given that these are such important
and long-festering issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Dubrow, who said there was no expectation that the conferees
would gather ``just to pat one another on the back,'' said he
believes there is positive forward movement on the US proposal on
looted art, though he said there is not yet consensus.
</P>
<P>
   Though Albright said in her welcoming remarks that the
conference ``requires that painful memories be revisited, easy
evasions confronted, and inconvenient questions asked and
answered,'' The US hosts had given every other indication possible
that they wanted to avoid confrontation of any sort.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, art investigator Willi Korte said the Americans
miscalculated how divisive such issues are in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is not pursuing any substantial claims
against other countries, nor are there any claims against the
United States,'' Korte said in an interview. ``They do not realize
how difficult, controversial and complex these issues are in
Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   To insure comity, some critics have charged that the State
Department pruned from the list of speakers some experts they
thought would be controversial, though State Department officials
have denied doing so.
</P>
<P>
   One expert who was told she would be included as a panelist,
only to have her name dropped, was Patricia Kennedy Grimsted, an
associate at the Ukrainian Research Institute at Harvard and one of
the world's leading experts on the restitution of historical and
government records.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole subject is controversial,'' she said, Russia's
refusal to return to European countries the important archival
records that Soviet troops took home from Germany after World War
II. Germany had looted the archives from Occupied Europe during the
war.
</P>
<P>
   When she was in Amsterdam last week, Grimsted discovered she had
not only been dropped from the panel on archival restitution, but
that she could not even get a pass to attend the conference. She
will give a seminar on her research this Friday at the National
Archives.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a complicated story and a complicated issue,''
Grimsted said of the archives in Russian possession. ``Yet the
people in Washington want to make it all very simple. They want
everything settled by the year 2000, and that's very unrealistic.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Washington conference, while expressing
gratitude for Grimsted's role at planning sessions for the
conference, said she was deemed ``too subject specific'' in her
expertise, since the US hosts chose not to focus attention on any
specfic country.
</P>
<P>
   Lauder, who is overseeing a World Jewish Congress art
restitution effort that was begun several months ago, said his
researchers have already been through catalogues of the holdings of
225 museums, looking at ownership information that might raise
suspicions that the works were plundered by the Nazis and not
restituted after the war.
</P>
<P>
   Lauder did not identify the museums or the countries, but art
specialists said Wednesday that they expect that not many of the
artworks are in US museums.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Janner, who angered the US hosts on Tuesday when he
suggested in a luncheon speech to the conference that a follow-up
session he held a year from now, held a news conference Wednesday
to raise the slave labor issue.
</P>
<P>
   Janner said the issue has implications even for the United
States, and that substantial compensation may be required. He said
the Holocaust Education Trust, which he heads, recently completed a
report showing that about one million of the six million Jews
killed in the Holocaust died from slave labor. An additional 7.7
million non-Jews were employed as slave laborers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Ford was sued as part of a class action suit
seeking compensation for its subsidiaries' use of slave labor.
Janner said that in addition to Ford and Daimler-Benz, other major
companies that used slave labor include BMW, Volkswagen, Krupp,
Siemens and Knorr.
</P>
<P>
   So sensitive was the State Department to the slave labor issue
that they had even dissuaded the National Archives from holding a
seminar on how to research slave labor records. And the substantive
discussions on how to deal with thorny issues of restitution have
all been held in private.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When they lighted the giant Christmas tree in
Rockefeller Center on Wednesday evening, they must have been
conducting a dry run to see if the electrical system worked. It
couldn't be anywhere near Christmas. Wasn't Memorial Day coming up?
</P>
<P>
   It felt that way. For the fifth consecutive day Wednesday, the
temperature was in the 60s in New York, when it ought to have been
in the upper 40s. The thermometer reached 64 in Central Park, 2
degrees below the record for Dec. 2. The sun was out strong. There
was nothing more than a balmy breeze. Sure it was December. Maybe
at the North Pole!
</P>
<P>
   The city was an expression of befuddlement. While most people
were out in light spring jackets or shirt-sleeves, there were
others who didn't seem to know it was May. They wore ski jackets
and coats with _ yes _ fur collars, or more precisely, they carried
their ski jackets and coats and cursed their fur collars. It was as
if a few buses full of tourists had unexpectedly dropped in from
Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Who could be sure what to wear? ``It's December _ it's supposed
to be cold,'' said Solange Bernall, 23, a baby sitter walking in
Park Slope, Brooklyn, Wednesday afternoon with a 7-year-old. ``I
put my winter stuff on. Then I put it away again. Then I take it
out. Right now I just feel really hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Weather that made no sense with Christmas on the horizon was
confusing people throughout the nation. Some cities reached record
high temperatures that were as much as 20 degrees above normal.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about skiing anywhere. Tennis and golf, if not swimming,
were the only suitable activities.
</P>
<P>
   The persistent toasty weather was making people a little
somnolent. In at Bryant Park in Manhattan during the lunch hour,
there were inanimate reindeer and giant red Christmas presents
decorating the lawn. Meanwhile, people basked in the sun in folding
chairs, in their shirtsleeves and with their shoes off. It's hard
to work on your Christmas shopping list _ and forget about buying
earmuffs and gloves _ when you're daydreaming about the beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who wants to wait on line at Macy's when you can be
outside?,'' said Midori Inoue, 30, who was having a cup of coffee
outside a Brooklyn cafe with her pit bull. ``I'll probably be doing
a lot of last-minute shopping this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Meteorologists were predicting more of the same irregular
temperatures for the rest of the week, and possibly even a day that
creeps into the 70s. The highest temperature ever recorded in
December in New York was 72 on Dec. 4, 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who found this spurt of benign weather bizarre needed
only to check with someone in Minneapolis. It should be in the 30s
there, snow underfoot. Tuesday, it was 68, the highest reading on a
December day in the city, and Wednesday was only slightly cooler.
That's bathing suit weather in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rather dead in here,'' said Barbara Pierce, the owner of
the Pierce Skate &AMP; Ski store in Minneapolis. ``It's even been warm
at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the dozens of record highs registered Wednesday, it
reached 66 in Newark, N.J., and 60 in Bridgeport, Conn. It hit 77
in Galveston, Texas, and 74 in Valentine, Neb. It was warmer in
South Dakota than in New York. In Sioux Falls, the temperature was
a record 70 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The thermostat has been turned up all year across the United
States. Through October, this has been the second warmest year for
the entire nation since record-keeping began in 1895, eclipsed only
by 1934. In terms of precipitation, this year stands second to
none, ranking as the wettest year ever, surpassing soggy 1973.
</P>
<P>
   For the Northeast, this has been the warmest year so far,
beating the record set in 1921. Seven states have been enjoying
their warmest years on record, including New York, Connecticut and
New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   So who turned up the heat?
</P>
<P>
   Fred Gadomski, a meteorologist at the Pennsylvania State Weather
Communications Group, identified the latest culprit as some Pacific
winds trapped for the past several weeks over much of the country.
``The atmosphere has been locked in a pattern of very strong
upper-level winds blowing vigorously from the Pacific Ocean and
directly into the heart of the American continent,'' he said,
noting that Pacific air is appreciably milder than the cold air
that comes from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the year and across the United States, this
predominance of Pacific air has accounted for the persistent mild
weather.
</P>
<P>
   After reciting the usual caveats about the unpredictability of
predicting weather, Gadomski mentioned that in another 10 to 15
days, there might be a different story to tell. ``There are some
indications in the long-range computer model that there will be a
substantial shift in the weather pattern that will lead to
extremely chilly conditions,'' he said. ``The path now from west to
east is going to undergo a shift where the pattern becomes more
north to south.'' In short, temperatures in the 30s. Believe it
when you feel it.
</P>
<P>
   As for winter, Gadomski was reluctant to commit himself in a
year of zany weather. ``There is no strong signal that suggests an
unusually cold winter or an unusually warm one,'' he said. ``If
there is any signal, it's that a bitterly cold winter is unlikely
because we've had a mild autumn.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Given the mercury level, it is hard to imagine anyone buying
coats or earmuffs, and retailers indicated that cold weather gear
was not having its customary winter appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomingdale's said that its coat business got off to a slow
start, but has picked up in the past couple of weeks. ``I think
people are anticipating the weather will get colder,'' Anne
Keating, a store spokeswoman, said. ``Everyone is waiting for the
weather to get colder.'' She said that fewer people have been
buying winter accessories like mufflers, gloves and hats for their
own use, though they are buying them as gifts, perhaps for friends
at the Arctic Circle. ``The boot business has been good,'' she
said, ``but it's been dress boots, not the cold-weather boots.''
</P>
<P>
   Saks Fifth Avenue said that items like cashmere wraps and
coverings made of pashmina (a lightweight blend of silk and
cashmere) are selling well at a time when normally they would be
relegated to stores in resort areas like Palm Beach. Saks also is
doing a brisk business in fur collars and boas that can be attached
to light evening jackets to inject opulence without making the
wearer too hot in this moderate weather.
</P>
<P>
   Some New Yorkers clearly are finding solace in this second
summer. Dr. Mark Warfel, a plastic surgeon in Manhattan, said he
normally needs to get his boat safely into storage by the middle of
October before the ominous northeasters blow in. ``But we're going
on one more sailing adventure this weekend,'' he said. ``This is
wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Capeci, 37, spent a good part of Wednesday at the
Prospect Park playground with her 2-year-old daughter, Delphine,
who was licking a vanilla ice cream cone. In December.
</P>
<P>
   ``This weather is better for everyone's state of mind,'' said
Ms. Capeci, who teaches English in the City University system. ``My
students seem less stressed out now even though it's final time.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, William Steel, 40, an elevator mechanic
having a drink at a bar on the Upper West Side, took umbrage at
this affront to his seasonal expectations. ``It's not winter
anymore,'' he said. ``I want the old winter back. It feels like
we're in California here.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people were downright apocalyptic. ``The ice up in the
Arctic is melting by the ton every day,'' said Anthony Vitanis, 71,
a retired steel carrier. ``We're going to see flooding and loss of
life, mark my words. The outlook as far as I'm concerned is very
bleak.''
</P>
<P>
   But Linda Fowler, 44, who drives a double-decker tour bus for
New York Apple Tours, was relishing the interlude. ``I'm a bus
driver and I don't miss the snow and ice at all,'' she said. ``It's
safer to drive. I'd love it to stay like this all year round.''
Nonetheless, she admitted that the unseasonable weather drained
some of the sport out of her work. ``I miss seeing the tourists
freezing in the upper deck,'' she said. ``They sit up there in
rain, snow and lightning storms.''
</P>
<P>
   Some New Yorkers were stubborn about yielding to the unorthodox
climate. If it was December, they dressed for December. Vi Gourdet,
56, was window-shopping on Seventh Avenue in Brooklyn on Wednesday
in his winter coat and hat. ``It can suddenly get cold, so I don't
change the clothes I wear,'' he said, looking about as if the
temperature might drop to zero without warning. ``I've spent
Christmas in Alaska and Hawaii, very cold and very hot, but either
one's OK with me.''

 SENIOR AIDE COULD IMPLICATE BIN LADEN IN TERRORIST ACTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If Osama bin Laden ever stands trial in New York for
the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Africa and other acts of
terror, it is already clear who prosecutors will call as a chief
witness: One of his senior aides who has been talking to U.S.
investigators for two years.
</P>
<P>
   The government has identified the aide in court papers with the
pseudonym CS-1, saying the person pleaded guilty to terrorism
charges in a secret proceeding in U.S. district court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   According to the government, the informant worked closely with
bin Laden from 1989 to 1996, a period when prosecutors assert that
bin Laden was ordering deadly attacks on U.S. soldiers in Somalia
and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   From the court papers filed in the investigation of the embassy
bombings in East Africa in August, it is clear that the informant
has provided crucial information to federal investigators. They
have cited the source in the papers filed to support the
extradition of two associates of bin Laden who are under arrest in
Germany and Britain. Bin Laden, a Saudi exile, is thought to be
living in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The source is also the basis for many of the significant charges
in the indictment against bin Laden himself, including the
assertion that he directed the attacks on U.S. soldiers in Somalia
and that he attempted to obtain nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known whether the source is in custody somewhere, or
hiding under government protection. As recently as 11 days ago,
records show, the source swore to a 5-page affidavit before a New
York notary summarizing his allegations against bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials adamantly declined to say anything about
the identity of CS-1, which stands for ``confidential source.''
</P>
<P>
   But at least one operative of bin Laden's group in East Africa
concluded more than a year ago that he knew the identity of a
crucial turncoat: Sidi Tayyib, a businessman who was married to one
of bin Laden's relatives.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The operative's concerns were inflamed by a report in a British
newspaper that Tayyib was cooperating with Saudi and U.S.
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In an August, 1997 article, The Daily Telegraph said Tayyib had
been in custody in Saudi Arabia since May and had given
intelligence officials details of bin Laden's bank accounts and
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The news of Tayyib's possible defection, the East African
operative wrote in a report apparently intended for the group's
commanders, ``almost made me explode.
</P>
<P>
   ``An important man with close links to'' bin Laden ``seems to
have fallen into the enemy's hands, and we have to take all the
appropriate security precautions against that,'' the operative,
Haroun Fazil, wrote in his summary of security concerns. Fazil has
since been charged in the embassy attacks and remains at large.
</P>
<P>
   The report was typed on a computer seized last year by Kenyan
authorities, according to a government filing last week in U.S.
district court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, U.S. prosecutors have charged at least six members of
bin Laden's organization with terrorist activities or conspiracy.
In one recent filing, they said their case will in part be ``based
on the testimony'' of the confidential source, suggesting that the
informant has agreed to testify at any trial of bin Laden or his
associates.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement appears to have resulted from a plea bargain in
which the source is cooperating in hopes of receiving a lesser
sentence. There is no indication that the source has yet been
sentenced and it seems likely that sentencing would take place
after the investigation and ensuing trials are complete.
</P>
<P>
   In the affidavit prepared last week, the source acknowledged
pleading guilty to terrorism charges in the United States and said
they stemmed from attacks on U.S. targets, which were not
specifically identified. The source described taking ``an oath of
allegiance'' to follow bin Laden's orders, and gave a detailed
account of bin Laden's group, including its history and inner
workings.
</P>
<P>
   The source told of private statements by bin Laden to other al
Qaeda members, encouraging them to attack U.S. troops and other
citizens stationed in the Middle East and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I either heard these statements myself,'' the source said,
``or I read them or learned of them from other al Qaeda members.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has also said in other court papers that the
source helped identify bin Laden's signature on a 1996 document
urging Muslims to kill Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Tayyib's whereabouts are unknown and he could not be reached for
comment.

CLINTON ASKS VIEWS OF TOP AIDES ON FREEING OF POLLARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House has asked the government's top law
enforcement and intelligence officials and key Cabinet members to
recommend by early next month whether President Clinton should
grant clemency to Jonathan Pollard, the former Navy analyst
convicted of spying for Israel, administration officials said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that Clinton may decide quickly if he should give in
to Israeli pressure to release Pollard, the White House counsel,
Charles Ruff, has sent a letter to Attorney General Janet Reno,
Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and Defense Secretary William Cohen asking for
their views on the Pollard case by Jan. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet has already made clear his fierce opposition to clemency
for Pollard. In the past, the Justice, Defense and State
Departments have joined the CIA in opposing clemency.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman, David Leavy, cautioned that while
Clinton planned to make a final decision on the case in a ``timely
manner,'' he had not set a deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The president is scheduled to travel to Israel and Gaza this
month to discuss the Middle East peace effort in separate meetings
with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and the
Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat. He seems likely to be confronted
with further questions from the Israelis about the Pollard case
during his visit.
</P>
<P>
   The case became a central issue in the peace talks held at the
Wye Plantation in Maryland in October. On the last of nine days of
strenuous negotiations, Netanyahu demanded Pollard's release in
exchange for his support for an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But Tenet, reflecting the views of the intelligence community,
strongly opposed Pollard's release, and made it clear to the
president he would resign if Clinton gave in to the Israeli demand,
according to several administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Clinton rejected Netanyahu's demand, and instead
agreed only to review the case again.
</P>
<P>
   Pollard's status has become a recurring issue in
American-Israeli relations in recent years, one that is raised at
almost every opportunity by Israeli leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Pollard was arrested in 1985 after spying for Israel for at
least 18 months. In 1987, he pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to
life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Pollard was a prolific spy, handing over thousands of classified
documents to Israel, often taking bundles of them out of the office
on weekends so they could be copied off by Israeli agents and then
returned on Monday so they would not be missed.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence and law enforcement officials argue that he
betrayed more secret documents than almost any other spy in recent
American history.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the most sensitive intelligence he turned over to the
Israelis involved Soviet weapons systems, material that had been
gleaned from spies working for the United States in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   While Pollard argued that he was spying for an ally that
deserved intelligence it had been denied unfairly by Washington,
American officials have never been certain whether any of the
information he gave Israel was in turn provided to Moscow, which
had its own spies in the Israeli government during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   American officials involved in the original damage assessment of
the Pollard case complain that they never received full cooperation
from Israeli officials and say that Israel has never agreed to
return all of the documents Pollard stole.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from Israel, Clinton has reviewed the case twice
before, once in 1993 and again in 1996. Each time, the president
decided against clemency after receiving recommendations from
Cabinet officials and agencies involved in the case.

PONCIANO NAMED COACH OF THE YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As a first-year head coach, Ron Ponciano admits he
made mistakes. Too many, he confesses, to begin counting them or
naming them. What he rarely mentions is what went right, which
happened to be plenty.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the Big Sky Conference coaches selected Ponciano as
the league's Coach of the Year. The award was announced Wednesday,
and Ponciano is the first CSUN coach to claim the honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty cool,'' Ponciano said. ``It's a great feeling. The
assistant coaches and the players did it. I didn't do a thing. But
it's a phenomenal feeling. It gives you an extra boost going into
the offseason.''
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano led the Matadors to a 7-4 mark, a second-place finish
in the Big Sky and within one win of the Division I-AA playoffs for
the first time. And he did it with a team decimated by injuries to
the offensive and defensive lines, a team projected to finish
seventh in the nine-team league.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way CSUN came within one victory of tying a school
record for wins in a season and registered its first win against
perennial power Montana.
</P>
<P>
   When CSUN pounded No. 13 Northern Arizona in the second game of
the season, it represented the highest-ranked team a CSUN squad has
defeated. Later in the season the Matadors beat No. 18 Montana and
No. 23 Weber State.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always question yourself of what you can do better,''
Ponciano said. ``I made a lot of mistakes during the year. We all
did. There's better coaches than me in the conference. I know that.
But this is great.''
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano said he voted for Montana State coach Cliff Hysell, who
guided the Bobcats to an identical 7-4 (5-3 Big Sky) mark.

 &HT;    Clemson lands a Bowden
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A couple of weeks ago, the state of South Carolina was
collectively lamenting the sorry state of its two major college
football programs. Clemson and South Carolina were a combined 3-17
when they met on Nov. 21. And the future did not look very bright.
</P>
<P>
   That could change starting today when Tommy Bowden, a member of
college football's famous family, is introduced as Clemson's new
head football coach. In Bowden, 44, Clemson will finally have what
its fans have wanted for so long _ an offensive-minded coach who
will bring excitement back to Memorial Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden is one of the hottest young coaches in the country after
leading Tulane, a perennial doormat, to an 11-0 season, its best
since 1931. Bowden's arrival will send waves of excitement around
the state, some of them reaching all the way to Columbia, where
South Carolina is will try to trump Clemson's hiring of a good
young coach by bringing in one of the best old coaches in the game.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina athletics director Mike McGee, knowing that his
school must do something bold to get the football program out of
its perpetual state of mediocrity, has offered former Notre Dame
coach Lou Holtz $1 million a year to take over the Gamecocks.
Holtz, who now lives in Orlando, is reportedly mulling over the
offer.
</P>
<P>
   If South Carolina lands Holtz, and presently there doesn't seem
to be another candidate, a state that was in the football doldrums
in November will bristle with excitement in December.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden replaces Tommy West, who was fired after a 3-8 record
this season. He reportedly will receive a contract that will pay
him just under $800,000 per year. But Clemson will not get Bowden
without paying a price beyond his salary.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden, in just his second season at Tulane, has a $750,000
buyout clause that the school has decided to invoke. Clemson has
agreed to pay half of that buyout, with Bowden left to handle the
rest.
</P>
<P>
   It could turn out to be a wise investment for Clemson. Since
Danny Ford was forced out as coach in 1989, Clemson has needed an
offensive approach that was sophisticated enough to beat Florida
State, which has won or shared every ACC title since it joined the
conference in 1992. Clemson has lost seven consecutive games to
FSU. What better way to beat the Seminoles of Bobby Bowden than to
hire his son, who learned the family business from the ground up?
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Bowden, 69, said he has no qualms about coaching against
one of his sons. In fact, he was already set to do it in the 1999
opener, when Florida State is scheduled to host Auburn. But Terry
Bowden resigned his post at Auburn in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind coaching against one of my boys, unless they beat
me, of course,'' said Bowden. ``I think that's a good situation
over at Clemson with great tradition. I didn't want them to fire
Tommy West, but it is a great opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   While Clemson's 3-8 season was its worst since 1975, the program
is in much better shape than South Carolina's. That's why McGee
must do something dramatic like hiring Holtz.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina went 1-10 last season and showed absolutely no
signs of progress in the five years of Brad Scott, who was an
assistant to Florida State's Bowden for 11 seasons. In five years,
the Gamecocks were 1-14 against Florida, Tennessee, and Georgia,
the powers in the SEC East.
</P>
<P>
   McGee has learned what has been painfully evident to the rest of
the league for some time. Because of the dearth of high school
talent in South Carolina _ not quality, but quantity _ and because
the Gamecocks must fight Clemson for that limited pool of
prospects, the school will never compete in the SEC until it can
recruit nationally.
</P>
<P>
   It will never be able to recruit nationally unless it has a
coach who can walk into any living room in America with instant
credibility. There are only a handful of men like that in college
football _ Bobby Bowden, Steve Spurrier, Joe Paterno and Lou Holtz
are on the short list.
</P>
<P>
   Holtz, 61, was in Columbia, S.C., this week and met with McGee,
who offered him the job. McGee has asked Georgia Tech for
permission to talk to George O'Leary if Holtz rejects the offer,
but O'Leary is about to put the finishing touches to a new contract
at Tech.

 &HT;    `Unknown' Madkin is Miss. State quick study
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STARKVILLE, Miss. _ Tennessee defensive lineman Darwin Walker
may have done Mississippi State a favor earlier this week when he
said he didn't know much about the quarterback he will be staring
down in Saturday's SEC championship game. Wayne Madkin isn't
exactly a household name in college football, but the perceived
snub has served to rally a close-knit football team that seems to
revel in being discounted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wayne Who?'' doesn't want to get drawn into a feud between the
top-ranked and undefeated Volunteers and his unheralded teammates
who will try to foil their national championship aspirations. But
the rangy redshirt freshman thrown into the starting lineup in
midseason has been gaining more notice as the Bulldogs have notched
three straight SEC wins to claim their place in the league's title
contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand it, but I don't have anything bad to say about
the guy,'' Madkin said, referring to Walker. ``After the game we'll
probably shake hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Madkin played the best game of his career Nov. 21 in a 22-21 win
over Arkansas that set the Bulldogs on course to win the SEC West.
This for a player who didn't enter the lineup until State's back
was against the wall early in the season.
</P>
<P>
   After a resounding 42-23 September loss at Oklahoma State,
Madkin started in place of ineffective senior Matt Wyatt. The
Bulldogs continued to struggle _ Madkin was the starter in
back-to-back losses to LSU and Kentucky _ but coaches noticed he
was gaining confidence.
</P>
<P>
   For the season, Madkin has completed 86 of 177 passing attempts
for 1,448 yards and 11 touchdowns, with just four interceptions.
``He's a lot tougher inside than he was earlier in the season,''
State coach Jackie Sherrill said. ``He's able to make adjustments
when he's out there. He's grown up an awful lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Madkin learned to adapt quickly while playing in a demanding
program at Johnson High in Huntsville, Ala., where he passed for
5,500 yards and 53 touchdowns in his career.
</P>
<P>
   He describes having butterflies, and admits they're flaring up a
little already this week. ``Of course I'll have them, it's the SEC
championship game,'' he said, excitedly.
</P>
<P>
   Madkin is normally low-key, and rarely is heard above a whisper.
But he isn't shy about pointing to the reasons for his rapid
progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's because of my maturity,'' he said. ``They can
draw it up on the board, but it's different when they snap the
ball. Once I got comfortable with being able to do that on the
field, I handled it all right. But if I had started the first game
of the season, I wouldn't have been ready for it.''
</P>
<P>
   His 6-foot-4 height and strong arm are his main features, and
like Tennessee's Tee Martin, he can be dangerous when flushed out
of the pocket. In offensive coordinator Lynn Amedee's conservative
game plan, however, he's being encouraged not to think option too
much.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really picked it up the last three or four games,''
center Eric Allen said. ``If something doesn't go right, he doesn't
dwell on it. He moves on and tries to make a better play the next
time. I'd hate to think where we would be without him.

 &HT;    The big `Cheese'
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ The banquet, an impromptu tailbacks
thanksgiving of sorts, is set for tonight. When Jamal Lewis and
Travis Henry say thanks to all the not-so-little people who made it
all possible, they'll probably do so in an atmosphere an offensive
lineman can appreciate and also pig out. Besides, Mr. Gatti's Pizza
dovetails nicely with Henry's nickname. Say, ``Cheese.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice way to appreciate what they've done this year,''
said Henry. Actually, this pizza paean to a Tennessee offensive
line that head coach Phillip Fulmer calls ``as good a group as
we've had here'' was Lewis' idea. But then, the line was his, too,
until that awful afternoon in Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Lewis was the leading freshman rusher in the nation.
Although he never started until the fourth game, the tailback from
Atlanta's Douglass High finished with 1,364 yards rushing. This
season, the fourth game was again pivotal for Lewis. Planting to
make a cutback at Auburn, Lewis tore a knee ligament. He and his
497 yards were done for the year. So, some thought, were
Tennessee's hopes of repeating as SEC champs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a situation we had to manage well,'' said Fulmer. ``I
felt really bad for Jamal. He looked like he was going to have a
phenomenal year. But it was all very professional and businesslike:
What do we need to do next? Who's our next-best player? We were
just going to have to lean on Tee (Martin, the quarterback) more
and (wideout) Peerless Price more.''
</P>
<P>
   And find another tailback. ``We had a lot of confidence in the
two Travises,'' Fulmer said of Henry, the rock-solid, 5-foot-11,
212-pounder from Frostproof, Fla.; and little Travis Stephens, the
fast train from Clarksville, Tenn. ``My only concern was how well
they'd hold on to the football. They're both just sophomores, but
we wouldn't be where we are without them.''
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't be 11-0, top-ranked and back in the Georgia Dome
Saturday night, where the Vols play Mississippi State for the SEC
title and a shot at the Fiesta Bowl and a national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ballgame is do-or-die,'' said Henry. ``If we win, we go
to the national. If we lose, they say we go to the Outback or
something.''
</P>
<P>
   If they win, the Vols will do so thanks, in large part, to
Henry. Once Lewis was lost, Stephens started the next week at
Georgia and gained 107 yards in UT's 22-3 win. ``Since then,'' said
Fulmer, ``Travis Henry has emerged.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Henry has had four 100-yard games in UT's last six
victories. After rushing for 113 yards and two touchdowns against
Alabama, he was dominant in the win over Arkansas (32 carries for
197 yards and a TD). Saturday at Vanderbilt, Henry bulled his way
for 136 yards in a typically Cheesy way. There are two explanations
for his nickname: That Henry looks and runs like a block of cheese,
or that he's hard to cut, like government cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the derivation, he's become a big Cheese who's helped
UT become the top rushing team in the SEC. The Vols average 216.8
yards rushing per game. They have rushed for at least 150 yards in
every game and topped 200 yards seven times.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Jamal went down, it was a sad thing,'' said Henry. ``But
me and the other Travis knew we had to step up. We went out to
practice with a different attitude, worked hard. It was our
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Both capitalized. Henry's rushed 150 times for 850 yards
(averaging 5.7 yards per carry) and seven touchdowns. He needs 150
yards for the 10th 1,000-yard season in UT history. Stephens has
run for 427 yards and three TDs. Now they face the blitzing defense
orchestrated by Mississippi State defensive coordinator Joe Lee
Dunn.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the offensive line blocks the way I know they can block,''
said Henry, ``and we run the way I know we can run, we can pretty
much run on any defense.

 &HT;    Chandler anticipates he will play
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Falcons quarterback Chris Chandler practiced
Wednesday for the first time since spraining his right ankle on
Nov. 22, and the team is optimistic that he will play Sunday
against the Indianapolis Colts.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler worked out with the ankle heavily taped under his sock
and over his shoe, but other than stepping gingerly a few times on
rollouts, he looked stable. He improved dramatically from Monday,
when coach Dan Reeves said he'd have to make a lot of progress to
play. Chandler also worked out on Tuesday, the team's normal off
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to tell for sure,'' Chandler said. ``I had a
good practice today, and if it's not too sore ... I anticipate it
should continue improving. Barring anything strange happening the
next few days, it should be good enough to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons (10-2) are 14-4 when Chandler starts and finishes
games, 3-7 otherwise, including 3-1 this season.
</P>
<P>
   He is sixth in the NFL with a passer rating of 93.2. He has
completed 137 of 249 passes (55 percent) for 2,248 yards, 17
touchdowns and nine interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves was discouraged on Monday about the way Chandler had
performed during pregame warm-ups in St. Louis, where the Falcons
defeated the Rams 21-10. Backups Tony Graziani and Steve DeBerg
shared quarterback duties.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said after practice on Wednesday that the decision on
Chandler's playing status will be left largely to the player.
</P>
<P>
   ``There didn't seem to be too much problem, but we weren't
hitting and moving,'' Reeves said. ``I was pleased. I didn't think
he was going to look as good as he did. If it feels good, and he
feels he can move around and get away from people, then certainly
it will be his decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler has a ``high ankle sprain,'' which team doctor Andrew
Bishop explained is more painful than a typical ankle sprain. The
sprain involves a ligament high on the outside of the ankle,
connecting the tibia and fibula, the two major bones in the lower
leg.
</P>
<P>
   Every time someone with a sprain like this takes a step, and
especially when he or she pushes hard to the side, those two bones
separate slightly, stressing the inflamed ligament.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler suffered a similar sprain to the same ankle last year
against Denver, but did not miss a game because the Falcons had a
bye the next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about the same way it felt after the bye week last
year,'' said Chandler, who in his first game after last year's
sprain completed 10 of 22 passes for 117 yards and a touchdown in
23-17 victory at New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main reason it looked so bad (Sunday) was it was probably
the hardest tape job I've ever had. I had no blood circulation and
my foot was asleep.''

 &HT;    Kick coverage out of step
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tim Dwight's game is based largely on speed, but he
and a few players on the Falcons' kickoff coverage team were a
little too fast Sunday when St. Louis rookie Tony Horne returned a
kickoff 102 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   When rookies Dwight, Keith Brooking and Elijah Williams _ the
second, third and fourth Falcons from the left sideline _ pursued
too hard to the right, Horne cut back hard to his own right behind
them and tied the record for the longest kickoff return against the
Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the game, Horne had a 66-yard return to the other side.
A week earlier, Chicago's Glyn Milburn had a 61-yard kickoff return
to set up a field goal. That return was nearly identical to Horne's
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Falcons have dropped to 20th in the NFL in
kickoff coverage, allowing an average return of 23.6 yards. The
coverage teams have come under greater scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta works on kickoff coverage on Fridays, but film review
began Wednesday and special-teams coach Joe DeCamillis spent five
minutes after practice working on the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we had learned our lesson the week before,'' coach
Dan Reeves said. ``We got suckered in on something that should have
been clear as crystal.''
</P>
<P>
   In Dwight's first game back after missing five in a row with a
knee injury, he took rookie running back Ken Oxendine's spot. He
and Williams beat blocks about halfway down the field _ although
Williams was slowed up significantly _ and Brooking was blocked.
</P>
<P>
   They were too far inside _ out of their ``lanes.'' Their first
mistake was not recognizing something was up when they were blocked
so soon in the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (opponents) are trying to wall you inside (like St. Louis
did), they're going to try to come your way. That's the only reason
they block you early (rather than retreat toward the ball
carrier),'' DeCamillis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to ... keep the ball on your inside shoulder and
maintain position. On the second one (against St. Louis), guys were
just afraid to make a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of like, `Why's he blocking me early?' The next
thing you know, the guy is running past me,'' Dwight said. ``Now I
know to keep it wide.''
</P>
<P>
   There were two other failures on Horne's touchdown return.
</P>
<P>
   If the middle coverage men had busted the Rams' wedge, they
could have forced Horne to take a wider angle to the sideline,
allowing other defenders to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   Left safety Michael Booker, who lined up closest to the
sideline, missed his assignment. When the safety sees a hole open
up, he's supposed to fill it immediately rather than wait for the
ball carrier.
</P>
<P>
   By reacting too slowly, Booker gave a Rams blocker time to knock
him out of the play. ``We've got a lot of young guys on the
coverage team,'' DeCamillis said. ``The mistakes are correctable,
but we shouldn't be having to correct them anyway.

 &HT;    New faces right ones for Braves
 &HT;    By Terence Moore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Excuse me for what I'm about to say. I've been feeling
a little giddy lately. After all, this is the first time since
those who run the Atlanta Braves traded David Justice and Marquis
Grissom two years ago that I've seen them justify their genius tags
during the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Jordan? Otis Nixon? Don Baylor? Next thing you know, the
Braves will do something else as enlightened by trading Ryan Klesko
for a veteran bench guy and prospects as they prepare for George
Lombard's arrival in left field to begin the next century.
</P>
<P>
   I've got no complaints about the Braves' current direction.
Well, sort of. You don't acquire Bret Boone to play second base
when Fernando Vina is out there with nearly the same skills
defensively and with about half as many strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Since October is the only month that matters for the Braves
during this decade, we're talking about this team needing contact
hitters more than power hitters to conquer the epidemic of dandy
pitching and cozy games they often see during the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Vina has speed to Boone's none. Just as the Cincinnati Reds were
willing to part with Boone, the Milwaukee Brewers were prepared to
do the same with Vina when the Braves were still looking.
</P>
<P>
   That said, there isn't a need to be picky when the Braves
suddenly are doing just about everything else right.
</P>
<P>
   There was Jordan's acquisition, for instance. Just like that,
when the Braves signed this strong safety disguised as a right
fielder, they got a couple of things they've lacked since unloading
Justice.
</P>
<P>
   First, they acquired one of the game's hidden clutch hitters. In
1996, Jordan tied the major-league record for most hits with the
bases loaded during a regular season, and then he showed his clutch
ability in October. In fact, he did so against the Braves, with a
homer in the eighth inning of Game 4 of the National League
Championship Series to give his St. Louis Cardinals a 3-1 lead at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan also will add some tutti-frutti to the Braves' vanilla
clubhouse, and so will Baylor, the new batting coach. While Baylor
will somewhat resemble his predecessor, Clarence Jones, as a
quietly effective worker on a staff that likes to operate in the
shadows, Baylor also will liven things more as a former star player
noted for inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   As for the second coming of Nixon, it gives the Braves a leadoff
hitter, much-needed speed and better defense than Klesko. Nixon is
nearly 40 years old, but only on his birth certificate. Nixon
should start, and will, just as soon as the Braves continue to do
the right thing by shipping Klesko away.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the New York Yankees have shown their peers
that you can't get enough depth and experience in reserve. That's
why the Yankees have done at least what the Braves should have done
during the past three years by winning the World Series twice.
</P>
<P>
   Without Klesko, the Braves become more of a right-handed team in
their batting order. But Klesko is losing power each season, Nixon
is back, and Lombard is in the minors on the verge of becoming the
Braves' next great something.
</P>
<P>
   Good.

 &HT;    Trainer's departure surprises Holyfield
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Evander Holyfield said he was surprised when assistant
trainer Tommy Brooks left his corner recently to accept the
mentally exhausting position as Mike Tyson's trainer. Holyfield
understood the lure of more money but is perplexed by the manner in
which Brooks broke the news to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tommy called me and said, `Well, I've got this offer for a new
job in Phoenix,' '' Holyfield said Monday in New York after the
announcement of his March 13 bout against Lennox Lewis. ``I said,
`Well, Tommy, if that's what it takes to make you happy, you should
go for it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield said it dawned on him a few minutes later that Brooks
had not mentioned what the job was. So he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Well, I'm gonna be training Mike Tyson (in
Phoenix),' '' Holyfield said. ``I was like, `Well, OK.' There was
no reason to turn it into a negative situation, if that's what
makes him happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Turner, Holyfield's lead trainer, said he hasn't spoken to
Brooks since the Holyfield-Vaughn Bean fight at the Georgia Dome in
September. But he denied any friction between the two, and Brooks
maintained, ``Don and I will always be friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks will make between $750,000 and $1 million per fight as
Tyson's trainer, which approximately triples what he made as
second-in-command to Turner.
</P>
<P>
   Turner said that if he had been in the same position as Brooks,
``I wouldn't have done it. But that's me. Tommy should do what he
wants. I just wouldn't leave a champion to go with a guy who's
erratic.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks acknowledged that he was angered when Tyson bit Holyfield
twice in their rematch, but he said, ``After I thought about it, I
realized the guy had his back against the wall and he felt there
was nothing else for him to do. Fatigue will make a coward out of
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   King-speak
</P>
<P>
   Promoter Don King is assured of at least $2.5 million from
foreign sales for the Holyfield-Lewis fight, but he will be more
active than usual in this promotion because other potential profits
for him will come from pay-per-view sales of more than 740,000
``buys.'' The record pay-per-view event is 1.9 million buys for
Holyfield-Tyson II. King's belief that Holyfield-Lewis can hit 2
million is overly optimistic. Sales in the 1 million to 1.2 million
range are more realistic. The bout probably will sell for $49.95.
</P>
<P>
   Money matters
</P>
<P>
   A bigger surprise than Holyfield and Lewis finally signing was
seeing Time Warner/HBO executive Seth Abraham and King, a longtime
bitter rival, sitting together on the dais at Monday's news
conference. The two have a 40-page contract, and word was they even
feuded about the placement of an apostrophe in the fight's
promotional billing, ``Kings' Crowning Glory.'' The promoter wanted
it to read, ``King's,'' of course. Abraham wanted the reference to
the two heavyweight ``Kings.'' Abraham won. ``Negotiating a big
contract with Don King again is like dating your ex-wife,'' Abraham
said. ``You think it's the best thing, but only time will tell. If
the fist fight is anything like the negotiations were, it will be
like Ali-Frazier.''
</P>
<P>
   Sideshow
</P>
<P>
   The Garden wanted to make Monday's news conference a spectacle,
using video clips of Holyfield and Lewis, old footage from Garden
fights, fireworks, a ring and a luncheon on the arena floor to kick
off the news conference. But mostly, the news conference was just
plain long. It lasted nearly two hours, but Lewis spoke for only
four minutes and Holyfield for one.

 &HT;    Investigators examine secret memos about alleged fund-raising
abuses
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Judiciary Committee investigators examined
secret memos about the president's alleged involvement in campaign
fund-raising abuses Wednesday, and White House lawyers demanded to
see the same documents and other material so they can mount a
``vigorous defense'' of the president next week.
</P>
<P>
   Reversing an earlier decision, U.S. District Judge Norma
Holloway Johnson allowed one staffer from each side of the
committee to examine memos written by FBI Director Louis Freeh and
former Justice Department official Charles LaBella as well as two
supporting documents.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans suspect the memos contain evidence of the
president's involvement in questionable fund raising during the
1996 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   In accepting an invitation to appear before the panel, White
House attorneys say they needed access to the memos in order to
prepare a proper defense for the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is plain that the scope of the defense must equal the scope
of the inquiry,'' wrote White House lawyers Gregory B. Craig and
Charles F.C. Ruff. ``Once we have reviewed the material, we will be
prepared to present a vigorous defense of the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig and Ruff said they may want to call their own witnesses as
well during their appearance before the committee, which is
tentatively scheduled for next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Freeh and LaBella memos, the White House
would like to examine thousands of pages of evidence turned over to
the committee by independent counsel Kenneth Starr related to the
president's affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky
and Kathleen Willey, a former White House volunteer who alleges
that the president made an unwanted sexual advance on her.
</P>
<P>
   Paul McNulty, the press secretary to the Judiciary Committee,
responded to the White House lawyers' letter by suggesting that
``they should take that up with Attorney General Reno.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The committee will continue to be fair to the president,'' he
said. ``We are certainly willing to notify the White House prior to
its presentation next week of the issues it may wish to defend,
although the president knows the truth better than anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's decision to grant Republicans access to the memos was
a victory for Republican members of the committee, particularly
Georgia's Republican Rep. Bob Barr, who sits on both the
impeachment panel and the main House committee investigating
campaign fund-raising misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be more difficult for the Democrats to continue with
their defensive tactics if there is credible evidence in these
memos,'' Barr said. ``If in fact, it shows with some degree of
clarity that the president may have violated federal criminal laws,
that is very significant because it would be impeachable. It's
difficult to say that bringing foreign money in is irrelevant,
personal or just about sex.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Democrats remained confident that the memos do not
contain the smoking gun that Republicans hope for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democratic counsel has thoroughly examined the memoranda in
question and has advised me that nothing in these documents is in
any way relevant to this committee's consideration of possible
impeachable offenses by the president,'' said Michigan Democratic
Rep. John Conyers, the ranking member of the committee. ``The
majority's sudden lurch into the subject of campaign finance is
ill-advised and simply a last-ditch attempt to resuscitate a dying
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   In granting limited access to the documents, Johnson said it was
in the ``the public interest that this limited disclosure be
made.'' But she placed several restrictions: the documents can not
be copied or removed from the Department of Justice; no notes can
be taken and the contents of the documents must not be disclosed to
anyone other than the chairman and ranking minority member of the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   David Schippers, chief counsel for the Republican side, and
Kevin Simpson, deputy counsel for the Democrats, spent the
afternoon reviewing the documents.
</P>
<P>
   Following the closed-door hearing to grant access to the memos,
Arkansas Republican Rep. Asa Hutchinson said ``it is a step in the
right direction.'' Considered a bridge builder on the ideologically
split panel, Hutchinson said the release of the memos would have
little impact on the committee's agenda next week.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh and LaBella could appear for questioning by the end of the
week. Next week a legal representative from the White House could
appear before the committee for questions followed by closing
statements of the case by Schippers and Abbe Lowell, chief
democratic counsel. Debate on articles of impeachment to start as
early as Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   If any articles are approved, the matter could go to the House
floor the week of Dec. 14. Lawmakers then could vote to send
Clinton to trial in the Senate, censure him or do nothing.
</P>
<P>
   But if explosive evidence of criminal wrongdoing surfaces in the
memos, it could mean that the committee extends its deadline. ``We
will just have to wait and see what is in the memos,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's ruling gave investigators access to four internal
memos from the fund-raising inquiry:
</P>
<P>
   _ Freeh's memo to Reno on Nov. 24, 1997. Freeh has acknowledged
the memo recommended a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton's
fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   _ A July 16, 1998 interim report on campaign fund-raising abuses
and an Aug. 12, 1998, addendum from LaBella and James DeSarno, the
FBI agent who oversaw the campaign fund-raising task force.
LaBella, too, urged appointment of a special prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   _ An Aug. 5 , 1998 memo from Lee Radek, chief of the Justice
Department's public integrity unit, to James Robinson, assistant
attorney general. Radek reviewed and assessed the LaBella and
DeSarno interim report.
</P>
<P>
   _ An Aug. 25, 1998 memo by Robinson analyzing the
LaBella-DeSarno report.

CLINTON LEGAL TEAM SEEKS SECRET MEMOS TO PREPARE `VIGOROUS
DEFENSE' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House impeachment investigators Wednesday examined
secret memos outlining fund-raising irregularities in President
Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The president's legal team then asked for access to the same
sensitive information as they prepared to mount a ``vigorous
defense'' before the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of receiving a briefing on the internal Justice
Department documents, the Judiciary Committee's top-ranking
Democrat declared they were not ``in any way relevant'' to the
panel's impeachment investigation of the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We trust that this closes a short and unproductive chapter in
the history of this very strange proceeding,'' said Rep. John
Conyers, D-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., has no immediate plans to
discuss what turned up in the documents, an aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Early Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson agreed
to allow limited access to the documents, which fueled Republican
hopes of expanding their inquiry beyond Clinton's effort to conceal
his affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   If the memos provide information the Republican-controlled
committee considers worth pursuing, the panel is unlikely to meet
its self-imposed deadline for wrapping up the inquiry and approving
articles of impeachment by next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, White House lawyers formally agreed to appear before
the committee on Tuesday to defend the president and suggest who
should be called to testify.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter delivered to Hyde's office late Wednesday, the
president's lawyers asked for any information the committee is
considering as it prepares articles of impeachment, including
anything its investigators gleaned from the Justice Department
memos.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is plain that the scope of the defense must equal the scope
of the inquiry,'' said White House counsel Charles F.C. Ruff and
special counsel Gregory Craig.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Hyde can comply with the request regarding the Justice
Department memos is uncertain under the order issued by Johnson.
The judge, who previously denied the committee access to the
internal Justice Department documents, reversed course and ruled
that they could be examined by only two committee investigators _
one named by the Republicans and one by the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Neither notes nor copies could be made, according to Johnson's
order, which also limits the investigators to discussing the
contents of the documents with each other and with Hyde and
Conyers. Republican counsel David Schippers and Democratic
investigator Kevin Simpson spent about three hours examining the
documents Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP-controlled committee voted along party lines Tuesday to
subpoena the memos, which are in the possession of the Justice
Department. The documents have been kept confidential by Attorney
General Janet Reno, who has said their release could compromise the
agency's two-year investigation of campaign fund-raising abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Republicans had hoped to get unredacted copies of the
memos, but they considered Johnson's ruling a positive move. ``That
is a step in the right direction,'' said Rep. Charles Canady, a
Florida Republican on the Judiciary Committee. ``I don't believe
the restrictions are necessary, but that is the ruling.''
</P>
<P>
   The memos, written by FBI Director Louis Freeh and the federal
prosecutor who once headed the task force probing campaign finance,
Charles LaBella, include confidential information from grand juries
under Johnson's jurisdiction. When congressional leaders were
allowed to examine the documents earlier this year as part of their
investigation of campaign finance abuses in 1996, more than half of
the text had been redacted, or rendered unreadable.
</P>
<P>
   The memos contain summaries of the campaign-finance
investigation and conclusions drawn by Freeh and LaBella as they
recommended appointment of an independent counsel to take over the
inquiry because it touches on fund-raising activities by Clinton.
So far, Reno has declined to name a special prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   After Johnson decided to allow limited access to the Justice
Department memos, Reno issued a statement saying the agency has
``sought to appropriately balance the (House Judiciary) committee's
constitutional responsibilities with the needs of law
enforcement.'' The attorney general said Johnson's order ``has
achieved a just balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, a tentative scheduled for committee hearings was
announced beginning Tuesday, which had been set aside for Clinton
or his lawyers to present his case against impeachment. Also on
Tuesday, and running through Wednesday, committee investigators _
Republican Schippers and Democrat Abbe Lowell _ will summarize
their findings for the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Thursday, Dec. 10, the committee is tentatively
scheduled to begin debating and voting on articles of impeachment
against Clinton, who was accused in a report by independent counsel
Kenneth Starr of 11 counts of perjury, obstruction of justice,
witness tampering and abuse of his presidential authority. The
tentative schedule includes committee meetings through Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, in a memo outlining the schedule, Hyde said,
``Meanwhile, the committee will continue with its expeditious
investigation of other matters relevant to the inquiry, including
the taking of depositions'' from witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The White House complained Wednesday that House Speaker Newt
Gingrich and speaker-designate Bob Livingston have been strangely
absent as the panel prepares for a final round of hearings and
votes next week on articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously an odd situation where you have the Congress
undertaking the most grave responsibility they have short of
declaring war and the leadership saying that they don't want
anything to do with it,'' Lockhart said. ``They need to step up and
figure out a way to get this thing resolved expeditiously because
everybody wants to get this behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, who is resigning from the House despite winning
re-election Nov. 3, visited his Capitol office briefly Wednesday to
say goodbye to his staff but declined to wade into the impeachment
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, who takes over in January, has said he wants the
issue resolved by the end of the year, but is leaving the course of
the inquiry up to Hyde, the committee chairman. &QL;

FDA ACCUSED OF HASTY DRUG APPROVAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By DENISE GRADY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Releasing its own survey of doctors who work for the Food and
Drug Administration, an advocacy group accused the agency Wednesday
of lowering its standards for safety and efficacy, working too
hastily and approving drugs that should never have been allowed on
the market.
</P>
<P>
   The report has drawn a scathing rebuttal from the drug industry,
an oblique defense from the agency and criticism from
representatives of chronically ill people who advocate swifter drug
approval.
</P>
<P>
   But some scientists said the report raised significant concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, announced at a news conference, was conducted by the
Public Citizen's Health Research Group of Washington, which is
directed by Dr. Sidney Wolfe and was founded by consumer advocate
Ralph Nader in 1971. The organization has criticized the
pharmaceutical industry and, more recently, the drug-approval
process, which Congress accelerated in 1992 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The people surveyed were medical officers, agency employees
assigned to oversee individual drugs being evaluated for approval.
The survey was anonymous, and completed by only 53 of the 172
people to whom it was mailed.
</P>
<P>
   Among its findings were these:
</P>
<P>
   _ Nineteen medical officers identified 27 new drugs that were
approved even though the officers thought they should not be.
</P>
<P>
   _ Seventeen said the food and drug agency's safety and efficacy
standards were lower than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nineteen said they felt more pressure to approve drugs from
within the agency and from Congress and the pharmaceutical
industry.
</P>
<P>
   But a majority of the medical officers did not answer the
survey, and a majority of those who did answer did not complain,
making it impossible to tell whether the survey found genuine
problems or merely provided malcontents an outlet for gripes.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the drug agency said in part, ``The public
should rest assured that the FDA maintains the highest standards in
the world for approving drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Agency officials declined to be interviewed, and the statement
from Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the agency's Center for Drug
Evaluation and Research, did not specifically address issues raised
in the report.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Trewhitt, a spokesman for an industry group, the
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said, ``It is
highly irresponsible to issue a so-called study based on
clandestine communications with faceless, anonymous sources.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Ladd, president of the American Autoimmune Related
Diseases Association, in Detroit, said, ``We worked for FDA reform
to speed up the process.'' She said that new drugs that became
available through speeded approvals were very helpful to her group.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kenneth Kaitin, who studies drug regulation at the Tufts
University Center for the Study of Drug Development in Boston,
said, ``The research is shoddy, the survey is inconclusive and
equivocal, and by no stretch does it support the conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Charles Flexner, an associate professor of medicine in
clinical pharmacology at Johns Hopkins University, in Baltimore,
said the report raised important issues. Accelerated approvals have
helped people with HIV and cancer, he said, but more recently the
process has gone too far.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Carol Braun Trapnell, a former FDA medical officer who is
now director of medical affairs for GloboMax, a firm in Hanover,
Md., that consults with the pharmaceutical industry, also said the
Public Citizen report identified important issues.
</P>
<P>
   She said that she had worked at the agency for 11 years, until
about a year ago, and that the climate there seemed to change
toward the end of her tenure. There was less concern about
scientific issues, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, Dr. Braun Trapnell said, she told a supervisor that
she had doubts about a drug because of a lack of data about dosage,
but he told her to find a way to approve it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``You start to wonder why you're breaking your back trying to do
good science if that's the prevailing attitude,'' she said.

 &HT;    Weather may make Endeavour launch a `crapshoot'
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla._ The Space Shuttle Endeavour was
poised for an early-morning launch today to start assembly of the
International Space Station, but weather experts said the odds were
against it.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping for the best, the launch team started filling the
shuttle's orange external fuel tank with liquid hydrogen and liquid
oxygen Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Endeavour's six-member crew includes former Troy resident Nancy
Currie, an Army lieutenant colonel with two shuttle flights under
her belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had been launching today, we'd have been good to go,''
NASA's shuttle weather officer Ed Priselac said Wednesday morning
as bright sunlight glinted off the ocean. But with winds blowing
offshore clouds and showers toward the launch site, he said, ``We
expect the weather's going to (make today's launch) a crapshoot.''
</P>
<P>
   Some emergency landing sites under the shuttle's global flight
path were also expected to have marginal or unacceptable weather,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the precise timing required for this mission, today's
launch window would last 10 minutes, from 3:54 to 4:04 a.m. NASA
had set the launch time in the middle of the window at 3:59 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The next launch window is another 10-minute slot starting at
3:31 a.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Timing is important: Endeavour must chase down Zarya, the 22-ton
control module Russia put in orbit last month. Mission commander
Robert Cabana and pilot Frederick Sturckow will perform maneuvers
over two days to position the shuttle within a few feet of Zarya.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Currie will use Endeavour's 50-foot-long robotic arm
to lift the second piece of the space station, the Unity connecting
node, out of its berth in the back of the shuttle's payload bay and
mount it vertically atop the shuttle docking system in the front of
the bay.
</P>
<P>
   Once Endeavour is near Zarya, Currie will use the arm again to
position the Russian unit within inches of Unity's top end. Then
Caban and Sturckow will fire the shuttle's maneuvering jets to
shove the two units together.
</P>
<P>
   This will mark the first assembly of space station elements in
orbit, but the crew's work will be far from over.
</P>
<P>
   Currie will use the arm like a high-flying cherry picker to move
two astronauts, Jerry Ross and James Newman, on three spacewalks to
hook up cables and install equipment on the units.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-three more shuttle flights and nine Russian rocket
launches will be needed to finish the station, assembling more than
100 major elements in orbit. The first crew to occupy the station,
two Russians and an American, is scheduled to be launched in
January 2000. The station is to be finished sometime in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the first assembly flight for the station might also
become its first repair call.
</P>
<P>
   Zarya's electrical system includes solar panels and rechargeable
batteries, but one battery has not been charging and discharging
automatically as intended, NASA managers say. The battery can be
charged and discharged from the ground, but NASA is considering
having Endeavour's crew replace its control unit in orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Two replacement control units and connecting cables were stowed
in Endeavour's lockers, and the crew could carry them into Zarya,
remove a floor panel and replace the unit, mission payload manager
Steve Ernest said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crew is looking at the operations,'' Ernest said. ``We're
working closely with the Russians, obviously. Once a procedure is
established and the crew feels comfortable. . .we'll give a
go-ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of repair job cosmonauts have done countless times
to Russia's 12-year-old Mir space station. In fact, Endeavour crew
member Sergei Krikalev, a veteran Russian cosmonaut, made similar
repairs on Mir, space station operations manager Frank Culbertson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Krikalev, who is intimately familiar with Russian space hardware
after living aboard Mir for more than a year on two missions, will
help check out Zarya once the two station units are hooked up.
</P>
<P>
   This mission will also give Krikalev a sneak preview of his
future home: He is one of the two Russian cosmonauts assigned to
occupy the partially built station in January 2000.

 By ALISON MITCHELL and LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans overwhelmingly told their
leadership Wednesday they wanted to bring impeachment to a quick
vote this month in the House, as the Judiciary Committee, under
criticism for expanding its inquiry, appeared to be moving to wrap
up the investigation by the end of next week.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans made their views known as the staff of Rep. Tom
DeLay, the House whip, reached across the country to members for
the first time in a series of conference calls that helped gauge
the support for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The conference calls came after several days in which the House
Judiciary Committee looked like it wanted to expand its
investigation of President Clinton's relationship with Monica
Lewinsky into the area of campaign finance, raising the possibility
that the proceeding could spill over into next year. Committee
investigators reviewed two secret Justice Department memorandums on
alleged fund-raising abuses today, but Henry Hyde, the Judiciary
COmmittee chairman, while not characterizing their contents, made
clear he wanted to proceed on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is little appetite to pursue this past the first of the
year,'' said Rep. Bill Paxon, R-N.Y. ``Most members, whether they
are for impeachment or not, want to get this over with. They see it
is a political disaster to have it in the next Congress. Unless
there's something more, most members would want an up or down vote
and get it over with.''
</P>
<P>
   By day's end, Republicans said there were up to 12 Republican
votes against impeachment and another small core group of moderates
still unwilling to commit. Democratic leaders say they believe that
only 3 to 5 of their members will turn against Clinton. If the
Republicans lose only 12 votes, and if several Democrats break
ranks, impeachment could pass by a narrow margin.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Scanlon, a spokesman for DeLay, said the Texas
Republican was not trying to push the vote on impeachment in any
direction. ``These are members talking to DeLay,'' he said. ``We
weren't telling them where we are. Tom got on the conference calls,
asked a few questions and shut up. These were members talking.'' He
said that their overwhelming sentiment was to move quickly to a
vote.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, meanwhile, accepted the Judiciary Committee's
invitation to present its case next Tuesday. But it left open the
possibility that Clinton's lawyers may call witnesses. In a letter
to Hyde, Charles Ruff, Clinton's special counsel, and Gregory B.
Craig, his assistant, sought access to sealed material held by the
committee before Clinton's lawyers appear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is plain that the scope of the defense must equal the scope
of the inquiry,'' the White House letter stated. ``Once we have
reviewed this material, we will be prepared to present a vigorous
defense of the President.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans accused the White House itself of stalling. ``People
up here are not amused,'' an aide to Republican leaders said.
``There is concern growing that this is not a good faith acceptance
of an offer to testify. Rather it is more of a tactic to push the
schedule back, particularly where it may come up against
Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   The rapid series of events came amid new signs that Republicans
also overwhelmingly opposed sending a censure resolution to the
floor right now, and most likely not even if an impeachment vote
was defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Livingston, the incoming speaker, who has come under
criticism from Republicans and from Rep. Dick Gephardt, the House
Minority Leader, for his failure to take charge of the impeachment
process, was to meet with DeLay on Thursday. His spokesman, Mark
Corallo, said that Livingston would continue to defer to Hyde until
the committee had ended its inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to dispel the impression that its inquiry could spill
over into the new year, the committee put out a tentative schedule
to wrap up final hearings next week and then allot next Thursday,
Friday and possibly and Saturday for debate and votes on articles
of impeachment. That would allow the House to convene and vote on
any articles of impeachment the week of Dec. 14.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The Republicans counted as a victory a judge's decision to grant
committee investigators the right to review two secret Justice
Department memorandums, in which Louis Freeh, the FBI director, and
Charles La Bella, a former Justice Department prosecutor, made the
case that Attorney General Janet Reno should name an independent
counsel to investigate President Clinton's 1996 campaign finance
practices.
</P>
<P>
   Under an order by U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson,
one Republican and one Democratic investigator from the panel were
permitted Wednesday to read the full memorandums. The investigators
_ David Schippers, the chief Republican investigative counsel and
Kevin Simpson, a Democratic counsel _ were not allowed to take
notes or photocopy the material, conditions requested by the
Justice Department to protect grand jury information contained in
the documents.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans had subpoenaed the documents after saying they
had received information they could contain allegations of
wrongdoing by the president.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Conyers, Jr., the ranking Democrat on the House
Judiciary Committee said tonight that the four hours of review of
the memos had found they were not ``in any way relevant'' to the
inquiry into the President. ``We trust that this closes a short and
unproductive chapter of this very strange proceeding,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans did not characterize what they had found. But
one Republican official emphasized that unless there was
``stunning, stunning'' information, Hyde wanted to complete work
and report out one or more articles of impeachment to the House on
schedule by the end of next week.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they would take a closed deposition from
LaBella Friday and could possibly schedule Freeh for the same day.
But shutting down another avenue of inquiry, they said it was now
unlikely that they would question Bruce Lindsey, a deputy White
House counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the committee moves steadily on its course toward
impeaching the president, Democrats and some Republicans have been
pushing instead for Clinton to be censured in strong terms. But
Republicans said that support for censure among their members had
been steadily eroding for a variety of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   They said that even many moderate Republicans were infuriated by
Clinton's legalistic and unrepentant answers to 81 questions sent
him by the Judiciary Committee. Conservative Republicans believe
that tactically they will gain more votes for impeachment if
censure is not an alternative. And some Republicans believe their
party can run against Democrats as the party of sex and perjury if
Democrats are prohibited from going on for censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more the Democrats are on TV talking away on censure, the
less inclined the Republicans are to support censure,'' Paxon said.
``They see it as nothing more than a political out for the
Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   But several other Republicans said they are still quietly trying
to craft a censure option and hoped that Livingston might be
receptive to them once Hyde has finished his work.

EDITORIAL: THE ESPY VERDICT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thurs., Dec. 3:
</P>
<P>
   Former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy's acquittal by a jury on
corruption charges was not unexpected. The criminal case brought by
independent counsel Donald Smaltz was based on Espy's acceptance of
sports tickets, plane trips and luggage from food companies that he
regulated. But the value of the gifts totaled about $35,000, and
there was no evidence that Espy had made decisions favorable to the
companies because of the gratuities he received.
</P>
<P>
   Federal statutes that prohibit government officials from
accepting gifts do not require the showing of any quid pro quo. But
Espy argued that the gifts came from longtime personal friends,
which is allowed under the gratuities law. The tangle of
circumstances and the seemingly incidental value of some of the
favors worked against the prosecution. Indeed, the defense was so
confident in its position that it called no witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict does not mean that investigating Espy's conduct was
not proper and necessary or that he should not have been forced out
of office. But the trial's outcome does call into question how well
Smaltz conducted the investigation, which has cost $17 million over
four years. While he has achieved multiple convictions and $11.5
million in fines and penalties, they mostly involve those who gave
the gratuities. This case will probably be used by critics of the
Independent Counsel Act to justify changes to the act to limit the
time and cost of such investigations. Such reforms will have to be
fully debated by Congress, balanced against the need to maintain a
way to hold high-ranking officials accountable for their conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Espy, who was forced to resign from the Cabinet in 1994, brought
these troubles on himself when he apparently adopted the attitude
that he could ignore the federal gratuities law. Before joining the
Clinton administration he spent six years in the House, where gifts
and favors from special interests flowed freely. Carol Browner, the
head of the Environmental Protection Agency, testified at the trial
that Espy said he thought the ethics code that applies to the
executive branch was ``a bunch of junk.'' Others in the
administration find themselves under similar legal scrutiny because
they also seem to believe that the law did not apply to them.

EDITORIAL: A CLOSE VOTE ON GAY RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Dec. 3:
</P>
<P>
   The question is, what happens now? Twenty-one years after
passing a gay rights ordinance that spurred the rise of the
religious right _ and was then defeated by the voters in a battle
that raised civil rights for homosexuals to the level of a national
debate _ the Miami-Dade County Commission has done it again. It
took a whole generation to overcome the traumatic rejection of the
original ordinance, but on Tuesday, by a vote of just 7-6, the
commission added the category of sexual orientation to the county's
human rights law. It will now be illegal to discriminate against
homosexuals in housing, employment, credit, finance and public
accommodation in metropolitan Dade County.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the commission supported gay rights, reacting to a
new gay political network that had quietly rounded up money and
votes for several commissioners in the 1976 election, the vote came
as a surprise. There had been no debate to prepare the public. The
performer Anita Bryant, a devout Baptist and popular Miami Beach
resident, led a coalition called Save Our Children, which included
the Roman Catholic archdiocese, to trounce the ordinance at the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, some things are different. Nationally, Anita
Bryant's attack moved legions of closeted homosexuals into
political awareness and public activism. It also marked the
beginning of two decades of battle between homosexual and
conservative Christian activists over the issue of gay rights. In
11 states, 27 counties and 136 cities, elected officials have
passed laws to establish homosexual civil rights. But getting a
majority of any electorate to approve them is a different matter.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, gay rights leaders, some of whom were stunned in their
youth by the vote 21 years ago, are much better organized. They
carefully sought and won the endorsement of a broad coalition of
organizations _ from labor unions to business groups to the NAACP
and the PTA _ to demonstrate support in the community at large. And
because the language of the ordinance this time exempted religious
organizations, the Roman Catholic archdiocese said that it would
not oppose the measure. The commission, which 21 years ago was
almost entirely white, is now mostly black and Hispanic, and some
African-American and Hispanic commissioners voted Tuesday for the
ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   Like Anita Bryant 21 years ago, however, the Christian Coalition
in Miami is now deciding how to fight this new law. ``Whatever we
can do to defeat or repeal this ordinance, we will do,'' Anthony
Verdugo, the Coalition head in Miami, said Wednesday. If he should
seek repeal by referendum again, the battle would take place in a
county vastly changed. In statements before and after the vote on
Tuesday, the leaders of Miami and Dade County's civic, business and
political structure showed how much their support of the ordinance
has grown. But the population of the county has shifted in ways
that could lessen support for gay rights. Its residents are poorer,
fewer of them are Jewish or middle-class, and many more of them are
socially conservative Roman Catholic Hispanic immigrants than a
generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   If a referendum is scheduled, it will be a pitched battle that
could charge the national political atmosphere once again. With the
next presidential election in sight, neither the Christian
Coalition nor gay activists who felt they played an important role
in Bill Clinton's victory will want to lose the second battle of
Miami.

 Catching Bill Gates With His Pants Down  &HT;       
 By Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Here's your chance to dress up _ and consequently dress down _ the
nation's richest person.
</P>
<P>
   ``BillGates99: A Paper Doll Book'' is a low-tech treasure that
offers everyone _ from the high-tech cognoscenti to the common Joe
_ a chance to outfit a paper version of the CEO that America loves
to hate.
</P>
<P>
   See the Microsoft CEO dolled up as a certain U.S. attorney
general; be amazed at the sight of the high-tech land baron in
George Washington garb; picture an angelic Bill as ``Pearly
Gates.'' OK, that last image may be a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The colorful, snappy read costs $9.99 and ``requires absolutely
no RAM,'' according to its author, Seattle humorist Chris Alpine.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the 36-page construction book (St. Martin's Griffin)
takes only good-natured pokes at Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Alpine admits to being a fan of his subject. ``The guy is a
complete genius, and he loves comedy,'' says Alpine, 43, who has
performed stand-up acts onstage with Gates at several Microsoft
functions. ``He's a pretty decent guy away from business although
I'm sure I wouldn't want to cross swords with him on any deals.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, Alpine's creation lampoons the digital king's
inexorable march to eviscerate archrivals Netscape, Sun
Microsystems, IBM, Apple, Oracle and countless others.
</P>
<P>
   There are references to Gates' status as linchpin of the nerd
empire, cutting remarks about Microsoft's innovative ways (``simply
rewrite the stolen software his way ... and get it on the market'')
and a few jabs at the software titan's legal tussles with the U.S.
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   One particularly galling _ and insightful _ illustration shows
Gates wearing briefs with a worm-infested Apple Computer logo
strategically positioned.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the book includes more than a dozen outfits and
accessories for the four Gates paper dolls.
</P>
<P>
   It is also littered with Gatespeak. For example, when Bill says,
``It is preposterous to think that any one company could ever
control access to the Internet,'' what he really means is ``Give us
two more years,'' Alpine writes.
</P>
<P>
   Or when Gates says, ``Microsoft's future is very uncertain,''
the true translation is ``We're uncertain if we're going to own the
world, or just lease it.''
</P>
<P>
   Alpine said he was contacted by Becker and Mayer(was &LR; 
lowercase) &LR;  Books in Microsoft's back yard of Kirkland, Wash.,
about the parody. The publishers already had produced similar books
savaging President Clinton, Newt Gingrich and Martha Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   The book, Alpine's first, is available at major online and
retail book stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a big fan of Bill's. I'm sure a lot of the antitrust case
is jealousy,'' says Alpine, who has appeared on HBO, MTV and Comedy
Central. ``Besides, I own a chunk of Microsoft stock.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Alpine is set to perform during a Microsoft holiday
party F &LR; riday  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes that Gates &AMP; Co. find the book as humorous as his
publisher does.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't,'' Alpine jokes, ``it could be a long night.''

 New Lego Robot Toys Fun But Fail to Hold Teen's Interest  &HT;       
 By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
When my son, Andrew, was 7, he loved Legos. He was an intense Lego
builder, spending hours concentrating on building one huge Lego
ship or fort.
</P>
<P>
   And then he couldn't wait for the next trip down to Toys R Us to
bring home another Lego kit.
</P>
<P>
   Yet by the time he was 11, the Lego creations that filled his
room became dust magnets as Andrew turned to more typical teenage
pursuits, like video games, baseball, music and talking on the
phone with friends.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Andrew, now 15, is just the kind of kid whom the Lego Group
hopes to entice back with the new Lego MindStorms Robotics
Invention System.
</P>
<P>
   MindStorms combines the familiar Lego plastic building bricks
with one big yellow brick called the RCX that contains an 8-bit
computer processor. The RCX is the brain that turns an ordinary
Lego creation into a robot you can program to perform tricks like
following an outlined path or detecting intruders with a light
sensor.
</P>
<P>
   You also need a PC (there is no Macintosh version so far) with
speakers to use the programing software and tutorial that comes
with MindStorms. An infrared transmitter attached to the PC's
serial port beams programs from the computer into the RCX brick.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 700-plus pieces in the basic MindStorms package, which
retails for about $200, are two bricks with motors and two bricks
with touch- and light-activated sensors to control movement.
</P>
<P>
   Aimed at ages 11 and up, MindStorms is available at retailers
such as Toys R Us and selected Target and FAO Schwarz outlets. Sets
also are sold through &LR;  www.legomindstorms.com. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   You can use standard Lego bricks to build bigger robots, or buy
$50 add-on sets available sets with parts like claws, hands and
arms that Lego says enables MindStorms robots to shoot hoops, slap
hockey pucks and ``stalk, prey and attack intruders.''
</P>
<P>
   Lego of Denmark worked with some high-powered brains from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology to develop MindStorms.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to get kids to learn a bit of basic computer
programming and engineering, fire up their creativity and, along
the way, get them hooked on Legos again.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew tried MindStorms, which succeeded in stimulating his
imagination and in applying some basic programming skills he
already is learning in a high school class, and ... oh well, two
out of three ain't bad.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew reacted with a typical teenager's ennui to the prospect
of playing with a ``toy.'' Still, he immediately jumped in and
built the ``top secret'' Torbot based on plans laid out in the back
of the MindStorms booklet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once a Lego builder, always a Lego builder,'' Andrew
proclaimed after spending more than an hour building the
tractorlike robot. That was a mistake, though, because he had
jumped too far ahead of the MindStorms computer tutorial program
that teaches how to assemble and program the RCX step by meticulous
step.
</P>
<P>
   After disassembling the Torbot, Andrew found the tutorial easier
to follow. The RCX programs are pieced together, like the Lego
bricks themselves, on the computer screen using easy-to-understand,
color-coded blocks. The blocks contain computer programming
instructions that in proper sequence can make the robot roll for a
second, stop, turn or back up when it hits a wall.
</P>
<P>
   After a while and with the help of his little sister, Laura, to
find all the right parts for a simpler robot called Pathfinder 1,
Andrew became fired up as the tutorial presented more complex and
challenging programing instructions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, tight! Maybe this is interesting,'' he said. ``I've got
some ideas for this sucker.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, he had the Pathfinder 1 rolling and spinning along the
kitchen floor, banging into walls and automatically backing away.
Andrew hurriedly ran back and forth at each stage of the tutorial
to test out the latest program.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like randomizing in C++,'' he said, comparing the
MindStorms' programming language to the computer language he is
learning in high school.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he programmed the Pathfinder to start, stop, start,
stop in rapid succession, rolling and jumping herky-jerky across
the length of the kitchen floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Check out my low-rider,'' Andrew said. ``This is seriously
awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura giggled.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, though, Andrew became impatient with having to
go through the rest of the tutorial before venturing out to program
the RCX for new challenges. He set the Pathfinder down to gather
dust, along with his Lego ships and forts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to play with this all the time, and you know what
happened?'' Andrew said. ``I grew up. This is very time
consuming.''
</P>
<P>
   He went back to listening to his CDs and talking on the phone
with friends.

CSUN FISHING FOR LINEMEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Defensive and offensive linemen are Cal State
Northridge's dire needs. Linebackers, a few receivers and a couple
of tight ends would be nice.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the field. The real battles are under way. It's time to
recruit at CSUN.
</P>
<P>
   The coaching staff needs to parlay its surprising 7-4 season _
despite the 32-29 season-ending loss to Idaho State _ into
recruiting coups if it wants to remain in contention for the Big
Sky title. Coaches began visiting schools Tuesday, the first
official day of the recruiting season.
</P>
<P>
   And CSUN's Ron Ponciano, named Big Sky Coach of the Year on
Wednesday, has set the guidelines. If all goes well the Matadors
will sign 25 players to national letters of intent in February, and
Ponciano said 15 would be either Division I or junior college
transfers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some bulldogs here when it comes to recruiting, but we
need everyone to be a bulldog,'' Ponciano said. ``The kids all read
papers. They know how we've done, who we've beat and when we
lost.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears CSUN is already addressing the defensive-line need.
</P>
<P>
   Already, a handful of Division I players are expected to make
their way to CSUN. And perhaps they'll be there as early as spring
practice.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week or so, some Division I players made unofficial
visits to CSUN.
</P>
<P>
   NCAA rules prohibit coaches from talking about potential
recruits.However, University of Washington tight end Kevin Cooper,
a 6-foot-6, 260-pound sophomore, and Washington State defensive
back Jermaine Hunsaker, a 5-9 sophomore, were spotted on CSUN's
campus recently, and both expressed interest in transferring.
Cooper is from Brethren Christian High in Cypress. Hunsaker is a
graduate of Ganesha High in Pomona.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Oregon State defensive lineman Jason Mageo, brother
of Matadors defensive lineman Jacob Mageo, said he planned on
transferring to CSUN for his senior season.
</P>
<P>
   And former Washington State defensive tackle Taeao Salausa and
ex-Fresno State wide receiver Terrance Jones, a speed specialist,
are already enrolled at CSUN and are expected to be eligible next
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're going to take some of the transfers but not
all of them,'' said Ponciano, speaking in general about his
transfer beliefs and not about anyone directly. ``We want to see
what kind of character they have and that really comes from talking
to the kid. Then you talk to their coaches and they're pretty
honest.''
</P>
<P>
   In just the few days in which coaches can visit with recruits,
CSUN's coaching contingent has noticed a favorable reception.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past it's kind of been, `Northridge? You guys are in
what conference, and who do you play?' '' offensive coordinator Rob
Phenicie said. ``This year the reaction was so much different. At
one school, one of the coaches walked over to me with a grin and
said, `Hey, way to (mess) that Idaho State game up.' ``But that's
good. It shows they were watching and they knew what it meant for
us. In the past, no one really knew who we would be playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano said the key to CSUN's recruiting class could come down
to the school's administration. CSUN is supposed to increase the
number of scholarships from 50 to 55 for next season, but Ponciano
is hopeful he can get two of those scholarships immediately.

 New Panasonic DVD Player Proves You Can Take It With You  &HT;       
 By Dan Fost  
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
People who hate paying the airlines to watch a second-rate movie
with all the swear words and juicy scenes edited out can now watch
the movie of their choice right on their tray table.
</P>
<P>
   In stores today is the Panasonic PalmTheater, a portable DVD
player that shows &UR;  &LR; digital movies on a 5.8-inch screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PalmTheater seemed to be a natural,'' said Jodi Sally,
Panasonic's national marketing manager for DVD. ``You can take your
audio music anywhere, why not take your movies?''
</P>
<P>
   DVD _ which stands for digital video disc _ finally is reaching
the mainstream, with more 1 million DVD players shipped to the
retail market. More than 2,000 titles will be available in the
format by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   That helps make the PalmTheater a viable entertainment option.
In addition to its portability _ its rechargeable battery pack runs
for two hours _ the PalmTheater can plug into a television or
stereo system and work like a regular DVD player.
</P>
<P>
   Of course like any new technology, the PalmTheater doesn't come
cheaply. The two-pound device sells for a suggested $1,400.
Panasonic won't comment, but historically, prices have a way of
plunging in the consumer electronics industry.
</P>
<P>
   The device folds up to less than 61/2 inches square, has a
screen less than two inches thick and built-in stereo speakers
featuring ``virtual surround sound,'' which Sally described as a
rear-channel surround effect from just two speakers. It also can be
used with headphones, which must be purchased separately.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Plus, the PalmTheater offers all the advantages of DVD, which
puts full-length Hollywood movies onto a disc the size of a music
CD. Features include the choice between letterbox or full-screen
viewing and the ability to jump to different scenes.

 MP3 Web Sites a Mixed Bag   By Neva Chonin 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Locating those darn copyright-infringing, illegal MP3 Web sites on
the Net can be like looking for multiple needles in a haystack:
Every time you're about to give up, another one pricks your typing
fingers.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the range of interesting material in the legal MP3
universe is about as exciting as cyber-Muzak. Overground MP3 sites
such as the Audio Forge ( &LR; www.audioforge.net &LR; ) offer a few
sanctioned tracks by major artists, live bootlegs and a slew of
recordings by unknown bands for whom MP3 technology offers new
horizons of distribution.
</P>
<P>
   But these also offer links to other sites _ which in turn offer
links to still other sites, and so on _ that dabble in the racier
stuff, including free downloads of multiplatinum,
mega-million-dollar-selling albums such as Lauryn Hill's
chart-topping ``The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,'' Green Day's
``Nimrod,'' Metallica's ``And Justice for All,'' ``Queen's Greatest
Hits'' and the soundtracks to ``The Sound of Music,'' ``Spawn'' and
``Love Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, such sites often vanish as quickly as they
arrive, only to resurface under new names. Yesterday's MP3 source
is today's failed connection. And the search goes on as the trail
of links breaks off into new branches.
</P>
<P>
   Some groups have jumped on the bandwagon with their own MP3 Web
sites. The Beastie Boys led the charge with a wealth of concert
material from their 1999 tour at  &LR; www.beastieboys.com. &LR;  At
 &LR; www.public-enemy.com &LR; /, populist rap outfit Public Enemy has
released a few MP3s from their new album, ``Bring the Noise 2000.''
And at &LR;  www.lessthanjake.com/, &LR;  ska-punk band Less Than Jake offers
a free download, in full, of its most recent CD.
</P>
<P>
   Is online music the final blow to an ailing record industry? Are
the MP3 pirates proletarian heroes or base thieves? It depends on
whom you ask and who wins the escalating copyright war.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the outcome, though, those who stand to gain are
computer-savvy fans, and those who suffer most will likely be the
independent record stores who once supplied those fans with
low-tech, hard-copy CDs.

 Everything You Need to Know To Use MP3  &HT;       
 By Benny Evangelista  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Here's a quick glance at what the MP3 format is and how it works.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 compresses digital audio signals by removing parts of the
sound spectrum not ordinarily heard by the human ear. The MP3
coding can compress an audio signal down by a ratio of as much as
12 to 1. According to the Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated
Circuits, a German audio research lab that played a major role in
developing the MP3 standard, the format's sound matches or nearly
matches a CD and is better than what's available on FM radio.
</P>
<P>
   To play an MP3 file, you need to download a software player.
There are about 70 different players available on the Web designed
for different operating systems, including Windows, Macintosh, Unix
and Linux.
</P>
<P>
   To copy songs from a CD into MP3, a process called ``ripping,''
you need to download a ``ripper'' program from the Web. There are
about two dozen freeware or shareware programs.
</P>
<P>
   Is it legal? U.S. copyright codes allow you to copy songs from
your own CDs for your own use, so in that sense, making MP3s is
similar to dubbing a cassette tape. But it's illegal to copy songs
into MP3s, trade them to others or otherwise make them widely
available without permission of the copyright holders of the song.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 stands for Moving Pictures Experts Group 1, Audio Layer 3.
MPEG is a group that works with the International Standards
Organization and the International Electro-Technical Commission to
approve standards used for the coding of moving pictures and audio.
</P>

 Fun Device for High-Tech Music Fans   By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
OK, I confess, I admit my guilt. Call the cops, call the D.A.
</P>
<P>
   Call the Recording Industry Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   My crime? I'm listening to an MP3 version of Madonna's ``Ray of
Light'' that I downloaded from a pirate Web site into one of
Diamond Multimedia's new $199 Rio PMP300 players.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact, while in the mood to clear my conscience, I
should admit that I've also loaded pirate copies of Celine Dion's
``My Heart Will Go On'' and an oldie but goodie ``Low Rider'' by
War into the little Rio.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, I know I've broken the Audio Home Recording Act, but it's
so easy to do. Blame it on the Rio, Diamond Multimedia's portable
MP3 player that hit the stores shelves last week.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The Rio _ which comes with a cable for connecting to your PC
to download tunes and earphones for listening to them _ is an
interesting newfangled toy that's great for MP3 music fans even
though it still has a few limitations.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 is a format for compressing audio files found on the
Internet or copied off CDs. Previously, those files could only be
played using a computer with speakers. The Rio cuts that tether.
</P>
<P>
   The basic Rio stores MP3s on an eraseable 32-megabyte flash card
that comes with the unit. That's supposed to be enough for 60
minutes of what Diamond calls ``continuous digital quality
playback'' and eight hours of ``voice quality audio.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet I was only able to cram about nine songs in the Rio _ almost
enough for the 40-minute BART trip into work. You can buy an
additional 32MB flash card for $99, or a 16MB card for $49 _ pretty
steep compared to the cost of a blank cassette tape.
</P>
<P>
   Smooth Sound
</P>
<P>
   The Rio's main advantage is that there are no moving parts,
unlike a portable CD player, which spins a disk read by a laser
beam. One bump and the music skips. With the Rio, you can pound
through Market Street with a jackhammer and it wouldn't miss a
beat.
</P>
<P>
   The other advantage is its size. The Rio is about the size and
weight of a tin of Altoids mints, and more portable than the
smallest Walkman cassette player.
</P>
<P>
   MP3s work by compressing audio files, removing sound waves the
human ear doesn't normally hear. That still leaves a rich, clear
stereo sound that Diamond says is ``near CD quality.'' The quality
of the sound produced by the Rio compared to a CD was good enough
for my average ears and anyone short of a picky audiophile should
be satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   The device has an equalizer switch to tailor the audio to jazz,
rock or classical music.
</P>
<P>
   I also ``ripped'' (MP3 language for ``copied,'' not ``ripped
off'') two songs from a CD, and the MP3 was just as crisp as the
original and far better than songs copied on a cassette.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, I'm not copping to yet another crime: Under the
aforementioned home recording act, U.S. copyright protection code
that was written with vinyl records and cassette tape in mind, it's
legal to copy songs from your own CDs for your own use, as long as
you don't distribute the copies to others.
</P>
<P>
   Moving From CD to MP3
</P>
<P>
   The Rio comes with software called MusicMatch that converts CDs
to MP3s in your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Setting up and using the Rio is easy. It comes with an adapter
that plugs into a standard computer parallel port.
</P>
<P>
   There are two ways to transfer music into the device.
</P>
<P>
   If you want music from the Internet, go to an MP3 Web site and
download a song to your PC, which is best done on a high-speed
Internet access line. One song that took 20 to 30 minutes to
download using my 56Kbps modem at home took less than 30 seconds
using a high-speed line at work.
</P>
<P>
   Then you plug the Rio's adapter into your PC's parallel port and
transfer the song into the Rio, which takes less than 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, if you want to transfer music from your own CD,
you put the CD in your computer and use the MusicMatch software to
convert the songs into MP3 format on your hard drive. This is a
slow process; ripping a four-minute Tower of Power song took seven
minutes with MusicMatch. Another type of ripper program took an
hour for a four-minute song.
</P>
<P>
   Both methods are more cumbersome than the easy cassette copying
we're used to.
</P>
<P>
   Tracking Down Music
</P>
<P>
   Finding songs, whether they are legal or illegal, on the
Internet can be time-consuming, navigating past broken links and
pornographic sites that have piggy-backed onto MP3 sites.
</P>
<P>
   The Rio drains the one AA battery it uses quickly because it
remains in a ``low-power'' mode even when turned off. On the
demonstration model Diamond sent for a test drive, the battery lost
two-thirds of its power in four days even though the Rio was turned
off much of the time. Diamond advises taking out the battery when
the Rio is not in use for a while. There is no AC adapter.
</P>
<P>
   Serious MP3 fans and early adopters will love the Rio, and
analyst Mark Hardie of Forrester Research believes Diamond will
quickly reach six figures in unit sales, even at the $200 price
tag. ``I would buy one for $400,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He might have the chance soon. Saehan Information Systems of
South Korea has also just introduced its own MPMan player to the
United States. The first MPMan, already selling in Japan and
Europe, is also $199, has 32MB of flash memory expandable to 64MB.
But at the recent Comdex technology trade show in Las Vegas, Saehan
displayed future models that may hit stores by the end of 1999 that
cost as much as $500, but have hard drives or a removable 40MB
Iomega Clik disk for storage.
</P>
<P>
   Saehan is also developing a vending machine that would let you
plug in your MPMan and buy MP3 songs for about $1.50.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers may want to wait for competition, falling flash memory
to drop the price of the Rio and similar MP3 players. That should
happen if sales are strong, Hardie said.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, $200 seems a little to steep a price to pay for an
hour's worth of portable MP3s. Then again, Sony Walkmans also
started out selling for about $200 each and turned out to be
best-sellers.

SERVICE STATION OPERATORS JITTERY ABOUT WHAT MERGER WILL BRING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif.)  (See also EXXON-TEXACO, EXXON-OPEC, EXXON-ROCKEFELLER) 
 (bl)  
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROSLYN HEIGHTS, N.Y. _ Art Barbuto's credit-card printer spat
out a terse message Wednesday morning: ``Dear Mobil dealers,'' it
said, ``A letter has been sent to you today with information on the
Exxon Mobil merger.''
</P>
<P>
   Like thousands of other gasoline dealers across the country with
Mobil franchises, Barbuto now must wait for answers to the
questions that keep popping into his head like the pangs of an
oncoming migraine.
</P>
<P>
   Will he have to pay more in rent for his filling station? Will
the combined entity of Exxon Mobil eliminate the rebates that
provide half of his profits? Will he still be able to send his son
to college in two years?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Barbuto, 42, is in a particularly precarious position.
His station, along the eastbound side of the Long Island
Expressway, is in direct competition with an Exxon station on the
westbound side. Will one of the two stations be shuttered or sold _
either by corporate strategists or by order of the government's
antitrust lawyers?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an awful lot of I-don't-knows,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon's $80 billion acquisition of Mobil is expected to result
in a loss of at least 9,000 jobs for refinery workers and
white-collar employees. Consumers could be unaffected, some
industry analysts said, if the combined company can bolster profits
by cutting costs rather than by raising prices.
</P>
<P>
   Caught in the middle, though _ facing neither the certainty of a
swift demise nor the slightest reassurance about the future _ are
gasoline dealers like Barbuto, who leases his shop from Mobil and
buys Mobil's gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   There are 8,500 Exxon stations in the country, and 7,400 Mobil
stations, according to National Petroleum News, an industry
publication. Self-employed dealers account for most of those
stations, industry analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   These dealers, who have struggled with shrinking profit margins,
are left wondering how many will survive the industry's
consolidation and at what price.
</P>
<P>
   The recent combination of the refining and retail operations of
Shell and Texaco, which took effect Aug. 1, suggests the dealers
may not escape unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Madani, a former Exxon dealer in Redondo Beach, Calif.,
said the combined Shell and Texaco quickly raised wholesale prices
and eliminated the cash rebates they had paid to dealers based on
the amount of gasoline they sold _ rebates that frequently meant
the difference between profit and loss.
</P>
<P>
   At Madani's station, now under the Texaco flag, monthly
operating profits have fallen sharply. He said he competes with a
nearby Mobil, where the operator pays $2,440 a month in rent, and a
Shell, where the rent has been raised to $6,000. Since August, he
said, the Shell station's pump prices have risen and its sales
volume has declined.
</P>
<P>
   Financially distressed Shell and Texaco station operators in 12
states are considering lawsuits over what they consider contract
violations resulting from the merger, said Jim Daskal, a lawyer who
represents several groups of gasoline dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Dave McKinney, a spokesman for the Shell-Texaco joint venture,
said he could not immediately respond to complaints raised by
unhappy dealers.
</P>
<P>
   With profits on gasoline shrinking nationwide, service stations
have broadened their businesses wherever possible. They have moved
from tiny retail counters with cigarettes and candy to ever-larger
convenience stores, with drive-up windows for sandwiches and
walk-in beer refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
   On this stretch of Long Island's prosperous North Shore, Barbuto
wonders what will become of his hopes to raze his old cinder-block
garage, with its three rarely used car lifts, and build a bigger
convenience store. ``The repair business is dead today, with the
advent of leased cars and five-year warranties,'' he said. ``All we
get is an oil change here and there, maybe a brake job or a
tune-up. I only have one mechanic now. I used to have four.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbuto clearly does not relish the idea of big change. Since he
bought the 35-year-old Mobil station from his father in 1983, Mobil
has overhauled its fee structure three times, he said. In one
instance about six years ago, Mobil charged Barbuto 20 percent of
gross profits _ including sales of gasoline and proceeds from auto
repairs. Then, he said, it started charging its costs on the
property, plus a markup. Overnight, Barbuto said, his costs jumped
from $3,000 to $8,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   These days, his Mobil has been locked in fairly stiff
competition with the Exxon across the expressway. The cheapest
grade of gas at each station was priced at $1.09 Wednesday, only 3
cents above what Barbuto said was his cost. His station sells about
250,000 gallons of gasoline a month from its three pumps, and he
believes he has the better location, since his is one of the first
service stations for drivers leaving New York City, where fuel
costs more. But Barbuto said he still fears what will happen if the
merged companies end up selling or closing some stations.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law gives gasoline dealers the right of first refusal to
buy their stations when oil companies decide to pull out of a given
area, according to C. Fred Weil, the general counsel for the Long
Island Gasoline Retailers Association. If an oil company instead
sells a group of those franchised stations to an independent
company, the new owner is required to offer dealers a chance to
stay on. ``I don't think any dealer is going to find himself out on
the street,'' Weil said.
</P>
<P>
   But Barbuto remains uneasy. While representatives of Exxon and
Mobil did not return calls Tuesday about their pricing structure
for dealers, Barbuto said all he had heard about Exxon was that it
charges gasoline dealers more in rent than Mobil does.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what gets me nervous about the merger,'' he said.
``With Exxon, if they raised my rent another $8,000, I could be
facing a $100,000 cost differential. That goes right to my bottom
line.''

 HMOs Propose Outside Reviews  &HT;       
 By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
California's leading health maintenance organizations are promising
that by the end of next year, 18 million consumers will be able to
ask an outside medical authority to rule on expensive and
experimental medical treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed plan, HMO patients, who are denied care by
their insurer, will be allowed to ask an outside expert to force
insurers to pick up the tab on these costly cases.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, only a few plans afford such an outside review. This
proposal would greatly broaden the review option, but still stops
short of mandatory reviews that 16 other states have already
established.
</P>
<P>
   Critics immediately denounced the external review program that
was unveiled yesterday in San Francisco by the president of an HMO
trade association. They say it doesn't go far enough to protect
patient's rights, since HMOs will still hire _ and possibly bias _
the reviewers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even as Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San Francisco,
praised the HMO industry for creating this self-review process, she
said she still intends to introduce legislation Monday to set up an
outside review process in which the state, not HMOs, selects
medical referees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure the reviewers are independent,'' said
Migden, who saw a similar bill stall last year.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy surrounding yesterday's announcement by Walter
Zelman, president of the California Association of Health Plans,
underscores a thorny issue in the health care debate: who gets to
make the final call on whether or not an HMO pays for a
controversial medical procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Under Zelman's proposal, California's 16 largest HMOs, which
cover about 18 million people, have agreed to create outside review
programs. Patients denied treatment because their HMO deemed a
procedure unnecessary or experimental, would be able to ask the
outside reviewer to force the HMO to pay for the treatment. The
participating plans say they will abide by these outside decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Each HMO is free to create slightly different review processes
and even ask consumers to pay for part of the cost of the outside
medical review.
</P>
<P>
   At least two large HMOs, HealthNet and PacifiCare, already offer
such outside reviews. The others have set varying timetables to
deliver on the promises Zelman made yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will touch all of the consumers by the end of 1999, and
most of the consumers will have this in place before that,'' said
Bruce Bodaken, president of Blue Shield of California and chairman
of Zelman's lobby group.
</P>
<P>
   But Betsy Imholz, health care lobbyist for Consumer's Union in
San Francisco, characterized the voluntary plan as little more than
a public relations ploy to influence the Legislature, which nearly
passed a mandatory review bill last session and seems even more
likely to act once Gray Davis becomes governor.
</P>
<P>
   Imholz said other states, including Florida and Texas, already
have mandated medical review programs that are stronger than the
California HMO industry's initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Imholz said HMOs probably wouldn't care if the state chose
outside reviewers, as Midgen's bill would mandate. But the same
issue that paralyzed lawmakers last year hasn't gone away. That is,
what happens if the outside reviewer also rejects a certain course
of coverage? Should the Legislature then let consumers take their
HMO to court _ which is extremely difficult to do now _ to ask a
judge to decide the matter?
</P>
<P>
   Zelman said the issue of outside review should be dealt with
before the state decides whether consumers should be able to take
haul their HMOs to court. He also insisted his plan was more than a
sop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd ask my critics this: Would consumers be better off if we
didn't impose this on ourselves?'' said Zelman, 54, who had a long
history as a consumer advocate himself before he shocked his former
colleagues by taking over as president of the HMO lobby in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Zelman said HMOs aren't terribly worried that consumers might be
allowed to sue them for denying care, especially if an outside
reviewer made the final call.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  But he said lawyers are trying to go even further and make
HMOs liable for all sorts of malpractice suits.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``If plans were to give an inch on liability, the lawyers
would take five miles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Karin Caves, a spokeswoman for the Consumer Attorneys of
California, called Zelman's comments ``hogwash.'' She said her
lobby simply wants HMOs to be held legally accountable for denying
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider external review a sham if consumers don't have the
right to sue HMOs for denial of coverage,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Migden, who has become a legislative leader on health care
issues, said Democrats will probably give consumers some form of
right to sue HMOs as part of any HMO bills. She said the only
question would be how broad that right should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were an HMO exec,'' she said, ``I'd be figuring out what
I can live with.''

GATES IS HIS FAMILIAR SELF IN NEW YORK APPEARANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST) 
(mk) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Bill Gates who has appeared on video screens in a
Washington courtroom is halting, forgetful, slumped in his chair.
As government lawyers in the antitrust trial that began in October
have repeatedly shown excerpts of an August deposition of Gates,
observers of Microsoft have speculated that the company's
long-running confrontation with the Justice Department has left the
company's chairman in a depressed funk.
</P>
<P>
   But the more familiar Bill Gates of computer industry lore _
sharp, self-confident and combative _ showed up in New York
Wednesday, serving up equal measures of playful scorn for his
prosecutors and his rivals at a luncheon sponsored by the Manhattan
Institute, a bastion of libertarian conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   Rivals who hoped the suit would curb Microsoft's fierce
competitive drive found no comfort in Gates' remarks. After
extolling the virtues of technology, Gates was asked by a member of
the audience whether Microsoft's extraordinary prosperity was
threatened by companies like Sun Microsystems Inc., which believes
that computing power should reside in networks rather than on
desktop computers.
</P>
<P>
   Gates dismissed the Sun concept as nothing more than a ``sales
slogan'' and went on to assert that the ``PC model'' with hardware
and software made by separate companies was a superior business
model.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, the PC model has defeated every other model,''
Gates said. ``There's no going back.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``next battleground,'' he said, was to demonstrate that the
personal computer could handle the industrial-strength chores now
handled by large ``server'' computers running Unix operating
systems and even by mainframes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't proved that yet, but we will,'' he said. ``The PC
model will take over the rest of the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates again proclaimed that America Online's planned purchase of
Netscape Communications Corp. for $4.2 billion, announced last
week, was proof that the Internet software business was a healthy,
vibrant industry, best left alone by the government. The fact that
America Online was willing to pay so much for Netscape, he said,
even after competition with Microsoft forced it to give its browser
away, is a ``very resounding answer'' to the government's
contention that Microsoft engaged in predatory pricing.
</P>
<P>
   When he described the antitrust suit as ``something that no one
should have to go through,'' the crowd applauded enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
   Still, life has not been too painful for Gates since the trial
started. Microsoft's stock price has risen 26 percent. And the
Gates family is expected to grow as well. A Microsoft spokeswoman
confirmed that Gates and his wife, Melinda, are expecting their
second child in June.

 Download That Tune, It's Web Music   By Benny Evangelista  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
``We're the music pirates,
</P>
<P>
   We sail the IR seas.
</P>
<P>
   We rip our favorite albums,
</P>
<P>
   We share our MP3s.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Lyrics from ``Pirate This Song,'' by God Ate My Homework.
</P>
<P>
   Homer, Hobbes and Earl Grey T are hardly household names.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to a file-squishing technology called MP3 that has
become a grassroots movement on the Internet, their band, God Ate
My Homework, is known by thousands of people. The group says
100,000 Web surfers have visited their site to download tunes like
``Pirate This Song'' and play them on a personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for three University of California at Berkeley students
who lack a recording contract and whose ``studio'' is small dorm
room and a desktop computer.
</P>
<P>
   The growing popularity of MP3s has provided an instant Internet
audience for weekend musicians like God At My Homework, a new
promotional tool for known artists like Dionne Warwick and the
Beastie Boys, and a major headache for the recording industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone in high school or college or any young adult who has
Internet access has probably downloaded an MP3,'' said Earl Grey T,
who is studying molecular genetics. ``The concept itself is
universally appealing _ the idea of getting free music.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea is so appealing that copying, trading by e-mail and
posting songs in the MP3 format is one of the fastest-growing
phenomena on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just a techno-underground-punk kinda thing anymore,''
said Michael Robertson, founder of a popular Web portal called
MP3.Com.
</P>
<P>
   Until two weeks ago, the only way to listen to MP3 songs was on
a PC. But just before Thanksgiving, electronics stores began
selling a $199 portable MP3 player, the Diamond Rio PMP300, which
can record MP3-compressed songs from the Internet or a CD and play
them in high-quality stereo.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the hand-held player could have the same runaway
success as the early Sony Walkman, spreading the MP3 phenomenon to
mainstream consumers just in time for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to sell like hotcakes,'' said Mark Hardie,
senior analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. ``It
doesn't skip, the sound is perfect no matter what you're doing. You
could be doing jumping jacks or someone could be punching you in
the head.''
</P>
<P>
   One measure of MP3s' popularity is WinAmp, the leading MP3
software player. According to WinAmp's creator, a bored University
of Utah dropout named Justin ``Badino Tarantino'' Frankel, copies
are being downloaded at a rate of 60,000 per day, and more than 5
million have been downloaded since mid-1997. And analysts say MP3s
have become one of the most-requested topics, besides sex, on major
Internet search engines.
</P>
<P>
   MP3s' wildfire popularity has the recording industry nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Recording Industry Association of America, which
represents major recording labels like Sony, Atlantic and Warner
Bros., failed to persuade a federal judge to halt shipment of
Diamond's Rio MP3 player. The association said the player, as well
as MP3 itself, encourages illegal pirating of songs and thus cheats
artists of their royalties.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, San Jose's Diamond Multimedia filed a countersuit
against the industry association, claiming the major record labels
violated antitrust laws by conspiring to ``stifle'' the Rio and
similar devices to protect their own control over music
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot at stake. According to Jupiter Communications, in
New York City, online music sales this year will total $88 million,
just a fraction of overall revenues. But by 2002, online sales will
hit nearly $1.4 billion or nearly 8 percent of the overall market.
And there is no counting how many legitimate music sales are lost
when fans copy songs from pirate MP3 sites.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 is setting the standard for an emerging new era in the music
industry _ digital distribution of songs and albums directly to
consumers via the Internet, bypassing traditional distribution
channels like record stores.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Web pages have sprung up offering MP3 songs. Many
of the MP3 tunes online are legal copies of songs or by unknown
artists like God Ate My Homework, who find the Internet a cheap and
effective way to promote themselves.
</P>
<P>
   There are titles from such better-known acts as Taylor Dane,
Peter Cetera and the Beastie Boys. And Dionne Warwick's oldie
classic ``Say a Little Prayer'' had 29,000 downloads during a
special MP3 promotion from her record company.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also countless pirate Web sites that feature
illegally copied songs from artists ranging from the Beatles to
Celine Dion.
</P>
<P>
   A team of record industry association Net surfers breaks links
to pirate MP3 sites as soon as it can find them, and it is
``finding thousands of them every day,'' said Hillary Rosen, the
association's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen insisted her association is not trying to stamp out the
MP3 format entirely.
</P>
<P>
   The solution, she said, is for the recording industry to agree
on an encrypted digital music standard that will keep songs from
being illegally copied.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quicker the record companies move to put legitimate music
online, the less incentive there is for people to search for
illegitimate files,'' Rosen said.
</P>
<P>
   But the major recording companies, which control about 80
percent of the world's copyrighted music, have been sluggish in
picking which technology to use, analysts said. That has allowed
MP3s to proliferate.
</P>
<P>
   If the music industry does not act soon, it may have no choice
but to join the MP3 wave, said Forrester's Hardie.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen at the recording industry association said it is
``difficult to quantify'' the revenue lost to illegal MP3s.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 promoters believe the music industry is using piracy as a
means to stall MP3s' momentum until it can set a proprietary
digital standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Piracy is not a threat, it's a smoke screen,'' said Steve
Grady, vice president for corporate communications with GoodNoise
Corp., a Palo Alto startup that is trying to become the first
record label to distribute music on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   One 29-year-old San Francisco man said he has downloaded one
gigabyte worth of MP3s from pirate sites and his own CD collection
into his home computer, which is hooked up to a stereo system. He
has created long playlists of songs that he listens to at work
without having to change CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, ``it may be illegal, but, hey, it's free,'' said the man,
who did not want his name printed for fear of getting a nasty
letter from the industry association.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 fan Kevin Fox, a 29-year-old Web site designer from
Berkeley, said he does not download pirated songs but still has
built an MP3 library of more than 600 songs that he copied off his
own CD collection and ``encoded'' into MP3s. That is legal as long
as he does not sell or distribute the songs.
</P>
<P>
   He has friends who ``each night pop in a CD to encode,'' Fox
said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, whenever he wants to hear techno groups like Nine Inch
Nails, or an old Beatles tune, or even the soundtrack from ``The
Little Mermaid,'' he has them just a click away.
</P>
<P>
   There is a certain defiant attitude among MP3 users that the
recording industry cannot take away their freedom of choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to defend the right to have this new method of
encoding music,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   And not all record labels see the MP3 as a threat. Independent
label Platinum Entertainment Inc. is allowing free downloads of MP3
songs from Dionne Warwick and The Band with Eric Clapton.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Executive Officer Steve Devick said he believes MP3s can
be as important a promotional tool for the music industry as radio
was in the early days of rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clearly what the consumer wants to do,'' Devick said.
``If the public is given a choice, I don't think they want to
violate the law or rip-off artists. But you create piracy when you
don't give people enough alternatives.''

 Some Electronic Holiday Products Are So Hot This Year,
They're  Cool  By David Einstein 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Some holiday gifts are so hot, they're cool.
</P>
<P>
   We took a look at the computers and related electronics
available this year and picked out a few items that stand out for
their style and performance. Price also was a consideration _ we
didn't include anything beyond the means of the average
computer-geek consumer.
</P>
<P>
   The following items share one thing in common: They all contain
cutting-edge technology that would make them the star attraction of
the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   It's Absolutely Clear
</P>
<P>
   First up is a personal computer monitor unlike any you've seen
before. The ViewSonic VPD150 is one of the new generation of ``flat
panel'' displays that have been under development for years. It's
got a full 15-inch screen, it's just 3 inches deep, and it takes up
almost no space on your desk. It pivots for either landscape
(horizontal) or portrait (vertical) mode. The picture quality is
stunning, offering up to 1,024 x 768 pixels of sharp resolution.
And to top it off, it includes integrated speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Although initially aimed at medical, industrial &LR;   &LR; and government
applications, it would look right at home in a state-of-the-art
home office.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Manufacturer:  &LR; ViewSonic ( &LR; www.viewsonic.com &LR; )
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Price:  &LR; $995
</P>
<P>
   Printing With Style
</P>
<P>
   Color inkjet printers have become so good that they can
faithfully reproduce photographs. And the cream of this year's crop
is the Epson Stylus Color 640. It combines high-end performance
with a low price that's hard to beat. You get 1,440 x 720 dots per
inch for sharp images, and photo quality when you use special
photographic paper.
</P>
<P>
   The printer comes with a bundle of respectable software,
including Adobe PhotoDeluxe, American Greetings Creatacard and
Broderbund's Print Shop Premiere Edition.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Manufacturer: &LR;  Epson ( &LR; www.epson.com &LR; )
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Price:  &LR; $199
</P>
<P>
   Picture Perfect
</P>
<P>
   One of the hottest gifts this holiday season is sure to be
digital cameras, which are rapidly becoming more of a challenge to
traditional cameras in performance while at the same time getting
less expensive. There are several nifty models to choose from, but
one that tops a lot of lists is the Kodak Digital Science DC260.
</P>
<P>
   This little gem combines point-and-shoot ease with exceptional
image quality _ up to 1,536 x 1024 pixels, which is enough for a
super-sharp 8-by-10-inch photo.
</P>
<P>
   The camera has autofocus and a 6X zoom. It also lets you
override the automatic controls for lighting and focus, in case you
want to use it like a traditional camera and get really creative.
</P>
<P>
   You can transfer photos from the camera to your PC using a USB
connector or infrared signal. Or you can display the photos right
on your TV.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Manufacturer: &LR;  Kodak ( &LR; www.kodak.com &LR; )
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Price: &LR;  $899
</P>
<P>
   A PC for Under $400
</P>
<P>
   Powerful PCs have never been more affordable, and leading the
pack is the new Etower from eMachines. For $399, you get a Cyrix
266 megahertz chip, 32 megabytes of RAM, a 2.1 gigabyte hard drive,
a 24x CD-ROM drive and a 56K modem. For an additional $100, you can
add a 14-inch monitor. This isn't some kind of toy. It's a fully
configured system that's more than powerful enough for word
processing, home finances and surfing the Web. And with its ATI
Rage graphics, it's even good enough for many video games.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Manufacturer: &LR;  eMachines ( &LR; www.e4me.com &LR; )
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Price: &LR;  $399 ($499 for a model with a 300 MHz Intel Celeron
chip and a 3.2 gig hard drive)
</P>
<P>
   Lean Mean Machine
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to laptop computers, thin is in, and no model
typifies the new lightweight trend better than the Sharp Actius
A150 UltraLight Notebook PC. Its 3-pound, 1-inch-thick magnesium
case packs everything you'd expect from a great sub-notebook _
except the high-end price. It comes with a 266 MHz Pentium MMX
chip, 64 megs of memory, a 4.3 GB hard drive and a 56K modem. A 20x
external CD-ROM drive is optional.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, the A150 has an 11.3-inch active matrix display
that provides a beautiful 800 x 600 picture. It's the biggest,
brightest display in its class.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Manufacturer:  &LR; Sharp ( &LR; www.sharp-usa.com &LR; )
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Price: &LR;  $2,299
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Pilot Still No.1
</P>
<P>
   This year has witnessed an invasion of personal digital
assistants _ handheld devices for keeping track of your schedule
and contacts. But nobody has been able to dethrone the PalmPilot
and its successor, the Palm III. Less than 5 inches tall and
weighing just 6 ounces, the Palm III can hold 6,000 addresses, five
years' worth of appointments, 1,500 memos and 200 e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a snap to use. It's fast, goes a long time on a set of
two AAA batteries and its handwriting recognition technology lets
you print right onto the screen.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Manufacturer:  &LR; 3Com ( &LR; www.palm.com &LR; )
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Price:  &LR; $369 ($249 for the PalmPilot Professional, a slightly
less robust model)

WEAK SALES SEND SEARS SHARES DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By SHARON R. KING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shares of Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. fell as much as 7 percent
Wednesday, after the nation's largest department store retailer
said weak apparel sales hurt revenues in November, and could result
in lower-than-expected earnings for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Several Wall Street analysts cautioned that the slump in
clothing sales _ especially outerwear, due to recent warm
temperatures _ could hurt other major department store retailers as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pain that Sears is feeling will be inflicted on other
competitors,'' said Richard Church, an analyst at Salomon Smith
Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Sears said total domestic store revenue declined 4.5 percent in
November, to $2.61 billion, compared with revenues a year ago of
$2.73 billion. Same-store sales slid 3.6 percent, compared with a
0.6 percent decrease last year.
</P>
<P>
   Total revenues for the four-week period ending last Saturday
were $3.49 billion, down 3.2 percent compared with last year.
</P>
<P>
   The news, delivered by the chairman and chief executive, Arthur
Martinez, at an analysts conference sponsored by Lehman Brothers in
Boca Raton, Fla., came one day before most retailers are scheduled
to report November sales. Analysts quickly lowered earnings
estimates for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasts of fourth-quarter earnings declined 8 percent, to an
average of $1.48 a share; earnings for the year fell 3 percent, to
an average of $3.33, according to First Call Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said the company now expected earnings to increase at a
low single-digit percentage rate in 1998, compared with an earlier
forecast of a mid-single-digit increase. Earnings last year were
$3.27 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Sears stock closed at $43, down $1.5625. The stock had lost
about 33 percent of its value this year. Shares of other major
department stores also fell.

GORE TRIES A 2000 THEME: `PRACTICAL IDEALISM' 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore on Wednesday offered up his
vision of the Democratic Party of the future, saying it should aim
for a ``practical idealism'' that leans neither left nor right but
moves forward and upward.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, testing a theme for his all-but-declared
presidential candidacy, contrasted it with the ``compassionate
conservatism'' coined by Gov. George W. Bush, the Texas Republican
who is a potential rival for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spoke here at a meeting of the Democratic Leadership
Council, a 13-year-old organization devoted to appealing to
moderate voters in the vast middle of American politics.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton's address to the same group in 1991 unofficially
opened his presidential candidacy, a bit of history that converted
Wednesday's meeting into a staging ground for a handful of Gore's
potential Democratic rivals, all of whom are courting the moderate
middle.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's ``practical idealism,'' a slogan he set forth Wednesday
for the first time, is based on his notion of navigating between
the political poles of the past _ labor vs. management, for
instance _ and rejecting ``false choices'' like that between
protecting the environment and fostering development.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, it is not much different from the ``third way''
that Clinton has advocated for the last six years. The difference
is in emphasis: Gore's platform relies heavily on technology as a
tool for education, helping people take care of their elderly
parents, protecting consumer privacy, containing suburban sprawl
and reducing the traffic jams that induce road rage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six years ago,'' Gore said of the onset of the Clinton
administration, ``we moved politics forward, beyond right and left.
Today let us move politics not only farther forward but also
upward, to a higher place, to a place far beyond the false
divisions and dichotomies of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   With virtually no philosophical differences separating him from
the president, Gore seemed intent Wednesday on contrasting himself
with the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a difference between using the rhetoric of the center
and actually governing from the center,'' Gore said. He said that
being compassionate meant saving Social Security before cutting
taxes, opposing school vouchers, rejecting the agenda of the gun
lobby and allowing women to decide for themselves whether to have
an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   With the vice president given the prime speaking role at the
meeting, other potential candidates were left to counter his
vision.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader,
staked out a kind of reality-based position in contrast to Gore's
somewhat abstract discussion. Gephardt called the Democrats the
party of ``kitchen-table, everyday issues,'' fairness and
opportunity, and called for an overhaul of the tax code.
</P>
<P>
   Getting wind of Gore's ``practical idealism,'' Sen. Bob Kerrey
of Nebraska said, ``Practicality is where America just begins to
dream, not where we wake up and say, `That's the best we can do.'
''
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, who has signaled that he
would make education the centerpiece of any presidential campaign,
faulted both parties for failing to improve the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was held against a backdrop of word that the party
would be looking for a new national chairman. Steve Grossman
resigned from the post Wednesday, citing personal reasons. He said
his father was ill and needed him.

Fortunately, these stoppers are easy to repair. The tools required
are simple ones, usually only a screwdriver and a pair of pliers.

CLINTON LAWYERS TO FACE HOUSE REPUBLICANS AT INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also IMPEACH, IMPEACH-CONSERVATIVE) 
(sw) 
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Trying to call attention to what they consider
Republican bungling, White House lawyers said on Wednesday that
they would defend President Clinton before the House Judiciary
Committee next week. But they demanded a raft of information in
advance to cope with what they called a ``dramatically expanded''
impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers said that they needed a little more time and a lot
more information to prepare their defense, even as Republicans
signaled on Wednesday night that they might limit the investigation
after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is plain that the scope of the defense must equal the scope
of the inquiry,'' the lawyers wrote in a letter on Wednesday
evening to Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, who as chairman of the
Judiciary Committee is leading the impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides have argued that Republican efforts to broaden
the inquiry into possible campaign finance abuses and other matters
will make it appear scatter-shot and partisan. On Wednesday night,
the White House appeared to be going a step further and seizing on
the proposed expansion as a lever to pry out information
potentially damaging to the Republicans' case and to Kenneth Starr,
the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``They bring things out of nowhere and put them on the table,
we're prepared to engage with them,'' said one senior White House
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The demands came as the public tone of the White House toward
the inquiry softened somewhat, from the outright derision unleashed
Tuesday to a sort of baffled condescension.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are politics at play here,'' Joe Lockhart, the White
House press secretary, said of the committee's doings, ``but we're
not smart enough to figure out what they are.''
</P>
<P>
   In their letter, the lawyers wrote that their defense ``may
include calling witnesses with respect to any or all of the matters
being considered by the committee.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House continued on Wednesday to insist that it wants
the impeachment inquiry resolved as soon as possible, and exhausted
officials are clearly eager to get it over with.
</P>
<P>
   But no one in the White House wants to risk losing an
impeachment vote, and aides acknowledged that they may have a
better chance of prevailing in the next Congress, when the
Republican majority will be slimmer.
</P>
<P>
   One senior White House aide said that delay could also be
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing has changed so quickly and so unpredictably who
knows what happens next year,'' this adviser said, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``I'm not able to articulate an advantage
beyond pure numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, the lawyers demanded to review information
in three areas: Evidence relating to Starr's impeachment referral
to Congress; evidence relating to Kathleen Willey, a former White
House volunteer who has accused Clinton of making a sexual advance
toward her; and evidence related to campaign finances.
</P>
<P>
   Among other specific items, they requested any decisions by a
federal judge about whether prosecutors denied Monica Lewinsky
access to a lawyer when they first surprised her with accusations
of an affair with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers said that they would need only 48 hours to review
the information, which, they said, the committee already possessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we have reviewed this material, we will be prepared to
present a vigorous defense of the president,'' the lawyers wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, which was approved by Clinton before its release,
was signed by Charles F.C. Ruff, the White House counsel, and
Gregory Craig, the special White House counsel who is coordinating
Clinton's defense.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers also requested their first meeting with Hyde, ``to
discuss how best to proceed.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton continued to present himself on Wednesday as removed
from the wrangling over his political fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you know, I have a group of lawyers handling that,'' he
said in response to a reporter's question. ``But the Congress in
the end has to make its own decisions about what it will do and how
it will conduct itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking while seated in the Oval Office beside the Pakistani
prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, Clinton added, ``It's important for
me to get on with the work of the country and that's what I'm doing
here here and that's what I intend to continue to do.''  &QL;

ANALYSIS: EXXON MOBIL LIKLEY INCREASE LEVERAGE OVER OPEC 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also EXXON-TEXACO, EXXON-GAS-STATIONS, EXXON-ROCKEFELLER) 
(bl) 
 By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With their planned merger, Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. are
expected to gain considerably more leverage in their dealings with
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,
reversing OPEC's quarter-century of primacy in this relationship,
oil-industry experts said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Exxon-Mobil deal, as well as the planned acquisition of
Amoco by British Petroleum, sets the stage for a new partnership
with large oil-producing countries that could help stabilize
prices, but could also curtail the search for oil in countries
outside OPEC, where production is more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, these mergers and acquisitions may restore to the
international oil companies some of the power they had in the 1950s
and '60s, when they were firmly in charge of each facet of the
industry, from prospecting for oil to refining it into consumer
products.
</P>
<P>
   Now, according to these experts, the consolidating giants will
regain control with the willing cooperation of some big OPEC
members, which have been financially squeezed by the collapse of
oil prices. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and several other countries are
now actively seeking the help of the big international companies to
keep their energy industries going.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the margin, these mergers are not good news for OPEC, or at
least all of OPEC's members,'' said Lawrence Goldstein, president
of the New York-based Petroleum Industry Research Foundation.
``They force everyone to be a player. They increase the relative
power of buyers against those who sell oil, and they create room
for even more savings and more cash to play with by the oil
companies. Exxon and Mobil together will need less inventories,
less gas stations, less pipelines and less people.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the lower prices are a potent force behind the
mergers. Oil prices have plunged about 40 percent this year,
reaching a 12-year low this week around $11 a barrel for American
crude oil because of the Asian economic crisis, ample supplies and
a succession of mild winters.
</P>
<P>
   So the oil companies are consolidating in part to gain further
savings in order to keep operating profitably in the face of such
low prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between OPEC and the oil giants, everybody is running around
like a chicken with its head cut off, trying to survive in the
low-price environment of today,'' said Amy Myers Jaffe, an energy
expert at the James A. Baker Institute for Public Policy in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a radical shift from the '70s, which saw the
ascendancy of OPEC and oil prices that at times zoomed up close to
$40 a barrel _ at a time when Big Oil was kicked out of many
oil-producing countries and saw its operations nationalized in
places like Libya, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Kuwait.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, with OPEC unable to stop the fall in prices, big
oil-producing countries are asking the giant multinationals to come
in and look for oil, inviting joint ventures that only a few years
ago they avoided.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years Iran, Algeria and the United Arab
Emirates have initiated joint ventures with international
companies. Saudi Arabia and Kuwait say they are now ready, and Iraq
continues to seek the lifting of a United Nations embargo to invite
the oil companies to come in as partners.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Texaco chairman and chief executive Peter Bijur said
he would go to Saudi Arabia on Friday to explore new business
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm encouraged by the opening of the mind-set of the Saudis,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Diwan, director of global oil markets for the Petroleum
Finance Co., a consulting group in Washington, said the growing
collaboration between multinational companies and OPEC nations was
likely to dampen the companies' interest in developing production
in remote, landlocked regions like Central Asia, where crude oil is
relatively expensive to produce and transport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be absurd,'' Diwan said, ``for American oil companies
to spend huge capital trying to get oil or gas from Central Asia,
building pipelines to transport it and shipping it at costs ranging
from $6 to $12 a barrel when they can move huge volumes of oil from
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iran on tankers at costs of $2 to $5 a
barrel.''
</P>
<P>
   For OPEC's 11 members, the picture will be mixed, Diwan noted.
The big producing nations, with billions of barrels in reserves,
are seeing the advantages of using the distribution and marketing
resources of the international companies to move large volumes of
oil. And countries like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are attractive to
the companies because the oil there can be cheaply produced in
great quantities.
</P>
<P>
   As such, the beneficiaries will include Saudi Arabia, which is
exporting 8 million barrels a day, as well as Iran, Kuwait, the
United Arab Emirates and, in time perhaps, Iraq _ all of which are
capable of exporting at least 2 million barrels a day. All but Iraq
have invited large companies to come in and discuss joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
   The losers are likely to be producers like Venezuela, Indonesia,
Nigeria and Mexico, which have relatively less in reserve and more
expensive oil or, in the case of Mexico, have resisted the idea of
joint ventures in favor of building up their own national oil
companies as world operators.
</P>
<P>
   Other big losers are likely to be smaller oil companies that
emerged in the last two decades to prospect for oil when it was
expensive enough to make money.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them are likely to retrench or even go out of business,
leaving oil in the ground that has become too expensive to be worth
the effort of extracting it. This is particularly so in an
environment where oil prices have fallen as steeply as in half over
the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Diwan estimates that in the last year, the use of drilling rigs
in the United States has dropped to less than 55 percent today from
100 percent, suggesting that fewer companies are looking for oil.
</P>
<P>
   This decline in exploration and production is good for OPEC as a
whole, Diwan declared. For years now, the smaller companies have
brought more oil onto the market, competing with OPEC production.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the OPEC countries, Saudi Arabia stands by far as the
biggest possible beneficiary from the Exxon-Mobil and British
Petroleum-Amoco deals. The Saudis have long had close and friendly
relationships with large U.S. oil companies _ ties that have
repeatedly paid off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always like our friends to flourish in the oil business,''
said Hassan Yassin, a Saudi businessman with oil interests.
``Exxon, Texaco, Chevron and Mobil have been good friends of Saudi
Arabia for decades ``It is natural they will be first in line and
the bigger they are, the better it is for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdelsamad al-Awadi, European marketing director for the Kuwait
Petroleum Corp. in London, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question consolidation of the oil industry is a
good thing for most of us,'' he said in an interview. ``Our area in
the gulf region has been neglected. The big companies will have the
money, and we have the oil.''
</P>
<P>
   The emerging relationship between the multinational companies
and OPEC is different in important ways from the one the companies
had in the '50s, '60s and '70s. Now, commercial needs are the
primary motivation, whereas in the past relationships were driven
by geopolitics.
</P>
<P>
   The change is important to OPEC, an organization that also came
to power out of nationalistic concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now open to joint ventures,'' said Nordine
Ait-Laoussine, a former oil minister of Algeria who played the
major role in 1993 and 1994 in opening the door to foreign oil
companies to Algeria.

3COM TO OFFER A PALM PILOT WITH WIRELESS CAPABILITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ Predicting that even limited mobile access
to the Internet will attract consumers to an $800 version of its
Palm Pilot electronic organizer, 3Com Corp. on Wednesday announced
a wireless version of the popular device.
</P>
<P>
   However the company said it did not plan field trials of the new
Palm Pilot with Bell South, which is providing the wireless
connection to the Internet, until early next year, and said it
expected the device to go on sale sometime in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The new version, a redesign of the current generation, the Palm
III, will be named the Palm VII. The company said its numbering
strategy left room for other new models but that none would be
available this holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm VIIs will allow only limited access to the World Wide
Web and e-mail through specially designed Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to turn this handicap into an advantage, Joe
Sipher, head of 3Com's wireless effort, described the low-bandwidth
design as ``Web clipping'' instead of browsing.
</P>
<P>
   3Com said information and service providers including Bank of
America, Moviefone, Mastercard, Visa, Frommer's, Fodor's,
E(star)Trade Group and USA Today had already agreed to develop
custom software and sites for the Palm VII.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, the company said the device would give
mobile consumers the ability to retrieve from the Internet small
bits of information like airline schedules and telephone numbers,
to send brief e-mail messages and to do things like make movie
reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to change the way people access and communicate
with the Internet forever,'' said Janice Roberts, the head of
3Com's Palm division.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless access to information has long been the Holy Grail both
of start-ups like Eo and Radiomail and of large corporations like
Apple, AT&AMP;T, IBM and Motorola. But most of their efforts to provide
it have failed.
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Goodfellow, who founded Radiomail Inc., the first wireless
e-mail company, in 1988, said: ``This is an attempt to repeat
history. This is still a zero-billion-dollar industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, 3Com executives said the Palm Pilot's popularity _ more
than two million have been sold _ coupled with growing consumer
dependence on the rapidly expanding Web would propel sales of the
Palm VII.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts, however, said they were disappointed by the wireless
service plan, which will begin at $9.95 a month but will cost, on
average, 30 cents for each 1,000 characters of information.
</P>
<P>
   Sipher said the basic plan would allow Internet access about six
times a day on average.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Seybold, editor of Andrew Seybold's Outlook, a mobile
computing newsletter, said he found the service offering
disappointing because it would force him to add a second e-mail
address, would limit Internet access to special Web sites and would
not allow retrieval of information from a desktop computer.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roberts shrugged off the skepticism. Noting that the
industry had also long been skeptical about hand-held computing,
she said, ``We've proved them wrong, and we have created a
business.''

fall out of alignment. Then they may not open or close properly.
Fortunately, these stoppers are easy to repair. The tools required
are simple ones, usually only a screwdriver and a pair of pliers.

ADMIRAL ACCEPTS PUNISHMENT FOR STEERING CONTRACTS TO LOVER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Adds information to graf 2 and adds graf at end)   (htv) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A one-star Navy admiral accepted a finding of guilt
Wednesday on charges that he improperly steered military contracts
to his partner in an adulterous affair. He agreed to early
retirement at a substantially reduced pension and to penalties
including 30 days of house arrest, Navy officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, Rear Adm. John Scudi, 54, effectively pleaded no
contest to the charges at a closed administrative hearing in
Norfolk, Va., which was a less severe alternative to a criminal
investigation and precluded any possibility of a court-martial and
prison sentence. If his case had proceeded to a court-martial, he
would have been only the second admiral to face criminal charges
since the Uniform Code of Military Justice was enacted by Congress
in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   The disposition of Scudi's case through administrative means, as
opposed to criminal proceedings, allowed the Navy to bring a quick,
quiet end to a matter that might have caused it sustained
embarrassment and scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations against Scudi, a graduate of the U.S. Naval
Academy who had served in the Navy for more than three decades,
followed a string of high-profile adultery cases in the armed
forces in recent years and heated debates over the military's
handling of accusations of adultery.
</P>
<P>
   Several experts on military justice and several Navy officials
who spoke on condition of anonymity said that Scudi's punishment
was in fact more severe than that meted out to most officers
accused of adultery. They said that the Navy was sending a clear
signal that it did not coddle high-ranking officers accused of
ethical violations.
</P>
<P>
   Comdr. John Singley, a Navy spokesman in Norfolk, Va., stressed
the severe financial toll of Scudi's agreement to request a
retirement at the rank of captain as opposed to admiral. If the
secretary of the Navy approves that request _ a formality at this
point _ Scudi's annual pension of $60,240 would be $17,700 less
than he might otherwise have received.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is hardly a slap on the wrist,'' Singley said. ``This
represents a significant economic loss.''
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Maginnis, a retired Army colonel who works as a
senior policy adviser for the Family Research Council, a
conservative group, said that the private administrative hearing
was a convenient, easy way for the Navy to deflect further
attention and humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a black eye removed, and this guy gets off fairly
lightly,'' Maginnis said. ``I think it's very light. The Navy is
setting another bad precedent by demonstrating that the higher up
you are, the less accountable you are. We've sent people to
Leavenworth for far less than this.''
</P>
<P>
   Maginnis said he was speaking in particular about accusations
that Scudi, who worked at the Navy's headquarters in the Pentagon
as the director of the its offices of privatization and base
management, steered about $150,000 in contracts over several years
to a woman with whom he was having an adulterous affair. Scudi is
married.
</P>
<P>
   Scudi's lawyer, Kevin Barry, did not return a message left on
his telephone answering machine Wednesday night. Navy officials
said Wednesday that Scudi has repeatedly declined requests to be
interviewed. They said he started serving his house arrest
Wednesday in the bachelor quarters at the National Naval Medical
Center in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Within the military system, adultery is usually prosecuted only
when it accompanies other accusations of criminal wrongdoing, and
the cases are usually handled as discreetly as possible.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Other prosecutions involving adultery have come to varied ends.
In 1995, Navy Rear Adm. Ralph Tindal was found guilty in a
non-criminal Navy inquiry of being involved in a yearlong affair
with a female enlisted aide and received virtually the same
punishment as Scudi.
</P>
<P>
   In an even more widely publicized case, First Lt. Kelly Flinn,
the Air Force's first female B-52 pilot, dropped her request for an
honorable discharge and agreed to a general discharge as a way of
avoiding a court-martial and a possible prison sentence on charges
including adultery and lying to senior officers. The general
discharge rendered her ineligible for pension and veterans benefits
and required her to pay back $18,000 in costs of her education at
the Air Force Academy.
</P>
<P>
   In Scudi's case, Navy officials did not have to offer him an
administrative hearing but could have proceeded directly to a grand
jury-style proceeding to determine whether enough evidence existed
for a court-martial. For his part, Scudi could have rejected the
administrative hearing and pressed for a court-martial, where he
would have been allowed to mount a more vigorous defense.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on military law said that both Navy officials and Scudi
would have been taking a risk if they had gone to a court-martial,
where either side could have lost its case. If convicted of all
charges, he could have faced dismissal, a loss of pay and benefits
and a maximum of 11 and a half years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The military's struggles over how to deal with charges of
adultery led to the announcement by the Pentagon in July of new
policy guidelines. Under the guidelines, commanders were instructed
to seek criminal charges in adultery cases only if the behavior
disrupted or discredited the armed forces.

DEATH PENALTY OPPONENTS PROTEST CONDITIONS FORCED UPON PRISONERS
AFTER INMATE'S ESCAPE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ERIC BERGER 
and ALLAN TURNER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As escaped death row inmate Martin Gurule evaded authorities for
a sixth day, death-penalty opponents and other activists gathered
to protest conditions forced upon the prisoners remaining at the
Ellis Unit.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters said prison officials have refused to allow
inmates to meet with anyone since the breakout, and raised the
possibility that guards are exacting retribution on the remaining
prisoners for Gurule's successful breakout.
</P>
<P>
   Gurule, of Corpus Christi, was among seven condemned killers who
tried to break out of the prison late Thanksgiving night. The other
six, under fire from guards, surrendered before reaching the
prison's fences.
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's protest, the sister of one of the six, Eric
Dewayne Cathey, said she was glad Gurule escaped and wished that
her brother had gotten away also.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell the truth I feel bad, really, that Eric didn't get
away,'' said Shelicia Baker. ``If it was me I would have done the
same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker and her mother, Willie Cathey, said they were also
concerned because they do not know if Cathey was shot during the
escape attempt or otherwise injured.
</P>
<P>
   That no one from outside the prison has seen the inmates, say
death penalty opponents, raises the question of whether they have
been mistreated.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of such a major escape _ it has been more than six
decades since a Texas death row inmate last escaped _ members of
the Texas Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty said prison
guards, flustered over their inability to capture Gurule, were
probably ``interrogating'' the prisoners left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a question of whether these six men are being
brutalized, it's a question of how much,'' said Dan Wirt, a Houston
physician who called for doctors not employed by the Texas
Department of Criminal Justice to be allowed to examine the
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Rubac, a coalition member, said all inmates at the Ellis
prison _ not just the six escapees and about 440 other death-row
inmates _ have been under ``lockdown'' conditions since Gurule's
escape.
</P>
<P>
   According to a memo allegedly passed out by prison officials
after the escape _ and mailed to the activists by an inmate _
prisoners will not be allowed visitors or any recreation time out
of their cells until at least next week.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials, who could not be reached for comment after
Wednesday evening's protest, have said little about the inmates
remaining at Ellis other than that they are being closely watched.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, authorities continued searching for Gurule near
Huntsville on Wednesday, employing ``low-pressure'' techniques they
hope will make him overconfident and blunder into being captured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of applying constant pressure, we'll be applying
random pressure. We want to confuse the inmate,'' said prison
spokesman Glen Castlebury. ``Where we once ran the dogs almost
constantly, we'll now use them on a random basis. Now he doesn't
know when they'll be running.''
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the change of strategy earlier this week, Wayne
Scott, Texas Department of Criminal Justice executive director,
reiterated his agency's belief that the 29-year-old escapee likely
remains in the 17,000 acres of prison property that surround death
row near Huntsville.
</P>
<P>
   Scott spoke of Gurule's ``resolve'' to remain motionless and
avoid officers and dogs.
</P>
<P>
   While as many as 500 officers are still engaged in the search,
and more state personnel are being requested, prison authorities
now believe their best chance of finding Gurule a Texas National
Guard helicopter equipped with sensitive heat-detecting equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft's forward-facing, thermal-imaging unit can
distinguish between humans, livestock and other animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can even detect a dead body,'' prison spokesman Larry Todd
said, ``provided that decomposition has reached a stage that some
heat is generated.''
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter took to the air Tuesday, but was grounded later
by dense fog. Another prison spokesman, Larry Fitzgerald, said
Wednesday that a similarly equipped U.S. Coast Guard helicopter
also will join the search.
</P>
<P>
   Castlebury noted that the agency's belief that Gurule remains in
the Huntsville area is based on police intelligence gathered from
around the state. Castlebury declined to comment on specifics of
the larger investigation, but police have grilled Gurule's family,
friends and acquaintances for leads concerning his whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   Prison authorities routinely try to capture fugitives within
three hours of their escape and within three miles of the prison,
Castlebury said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we don't consider this situation frustrating. It's just
our job,'' he said. ``I wish this were a six-day job, or a
seven-day job. But even if it takes two months, we will get the job
done.'' &QL;

FRENCH DRUG MAKERS TO COMBINE IN $10.4 BILLION STOCK DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two French drug makers, Sanofi SA and Synthelabo SA, agreed
Wednesday to merge in a deal valued at $10.4 billion, the second
alliance between two European pharmaceutical companies announced
this week.
</P>
<P>
   The new company, Sanofi-Synthelabo, will have $6.3 billion in
annual sales _ about one-fourth those of Merck &AMP; Co., the world's
largest drug maker _ and will have considerable product strength in
the industry. While analysts were largely unimpressed by the
partial merger between Rhone-Poulenc SA and Hoechst AG that was
announced on Tuesday, the union of Sanofi and Synthelabo won
considerable praise.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that a big difference between the deals was the
sales potential of the companies' products. Aventis, the company
created by Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc, will be largely saddled with
old drugs, while Sanofi-Synthelabo will have two cardiovascular
drugs _ Plavix and Avapro _ that could each produce $1 billion in
annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two drugs should be big sellers for Sanofi-Synthelabo,''
said Tom Brakel, an analyst with Mehta Partners, a
biopharmaceutical investment research concern in New York.
``Neither company has a lot of history with cost cutting. There is
a lot of duplication in some areas they are in, so there could be
some substantial savings here.''
</P>
<P>
   As with Aventis, investors fled both stocks involved in the
deal. Analysts thought most investors merely wanted to take profits
after merger speculation had lifted both stocks about 18 percent in
the last two months. Sanofi fell 7 percent, and Synthelabo dropped
2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will be a stock swap, with Sanofi offering 13 of its
shares for every 10 Synthelabo shares. The oil giant Elf Aquitaine,
which has a controlling interest in Sanofi, and the cosmetics maker
L'Oreal, which controls Synthelabo, will retain big holdings in
Sanofi-Synthelabo. Elf Aquitaine will control 35.1 percent of the
shares and 45 percent of the voting rights, while L'Oreal will have
a 19.4 percent stake and 25 percent voting control.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding at least one possible pitfall, the chief executives
have agreed to different roles in the new company. Jean-Francois
Dehecq, Sanofi's chief executive, will become chairman of the
combined company, while Herve Guerin, Synthelabo's chief executive,
will be vice chairman. Three megamergers announced in the drug
industry failed this year when the chairmen refused to yield power
to their counterparts.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Analysts have been impressed with Dehecq's ability to focus
Sanofi, which also has holdings in perfume and beauty and
diagnostic kits, more on pharmaceuticals, especially on high-profit
cardiovascular drugs. While companies more than twice Sanofi's size
were struggling to develop top-selling compounds, Dehecq and his
staff engineered two potential big sellers, a feat crucial to
keeping pace with the industry's 16 percent annual earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
   The merged entity should be able to squeeze more profit from
pharmaceuticals, analysts said. Both companies are regarded by
analysts as having shrewd research staffs, and the combined revenue
of both companies will allow Sanofi-Synthelabo to spend more on
research and development. Sanofi spent only $577 million last year
on pharmaceutical research, about half of what most large drug
companies spend.
</P>
<P>
   Dehecq has already signaled that Sanofi-Synthelabo will be more
dedicated to the pharmaceutical market than Sanofi has been in the
past. Sanofi announced Wednesday that it would sell its beauty
division, which includes Yves Saint Laurent and Oscar de la Renta
scents. The company did not disclose a timetable or price.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Sanofi-Synthelabo should have several top-selling
drugs, the company will have its share of troubles, including a
weak presence in the United States. Synthelabo has just one small
joint venture here, and though Dehecq has expanded Sanofi's U.S.
presence in recent years with acquisitions and joint ventures, the
company is still small compared with giants such as Merck and
Pfizer Inc.

SPORTS COLUMN: SHADES OF MEANING ON RACE IN NFL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Ala., Mich., Calif.)   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bryan Cox exploded last week after being fined $10,000 by the
National Football League. In the process of sounding off, the New
York Jets linebacker raised a thin curtain covering feelings and
attitudes about race.
</P>
<P>
   Cox accused the NFL of maintaining a closed shop in regard to
filling head coaching positions. ``The good-ol'-boy network is
alive and kicking,'' he said. ``How many black owners are in this
league? How many black coaches?'' Cox wondered about recycled
coaches. He criticized the NFL for maintaining a ``tokens'' and
``house Negroes'' mentality.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this league being over 70 percent black,'' Cox said,
``within the league office all the black people that are in any
position of authority are always pitted against the players in the
league. Why do we always have to be pitted against each other?
Every time we have to be subject to discipline of some sort, it
always has to be against a person of color.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox never mentioned names, but Harold Henderson, the league's
labor relations director, and Gene Washington, the director of
football operations, were prominently mentioned as the highest
ranking African-American executives in the league office.
</P>
<P>
   So, three African-American men, different generations, different
regions, are connected to each other by race and by the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Cox, 30, was born in East St. Louis, Ill., in 1968, three months
before Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated. Gene Washington,
51, was born in Tuscaloosa, Ala., moved to Long Beach, Calif., and
attended Stanford. He was a senior at Stanford when King
assassinated. Henderson was born in 1942 in Washington. He went to
Michigan State as an undergraduate and then to Harvard Law School.
</P>
<P>
   The year Cox was born and King was assassinated, Henderson was a
26-year-old rookie police officer in East Lansing, Mich. Henderson
heard about Cox's remark from his children, who were home for
Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got home from work my son said, `Dad, I guess Bryan Cox
doesn't like you,' '' Henderson said Wednesday from Dallas, where
he was conducting a seminar for club employees who deal with player
contracts. ``My son said, `So you and Gene are the only black
executives in the league, and are always pitted against the
players?'''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson's first reaction was ``Here we go again,'' he said.
``This is a guy who just is overly emotional and running off at the
mouth in a way that showed total lack of thought.'' He said Cox had
``a narrow point of view'' and added, ``You have to understand that
in the work force, that's the nature of management. That's the way
the work force views management: as being opposed to them. To the
extent that Gene and I and anybody else in the league is
management, there are some people in the work force who are going
to consider that as being opposed to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson admitted there was a prevailing strain of racism in a
process that allows owners and general managers to repeatedly tap
into the old boys network.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it present in people's attitudes?'' he said. ``It probably
is. We have to adjust the process by which coaches are changed. We
have to open the closed group. You go on gut feeling and emotion:
you tend to like people who are like yourself. Is that racism?
Bottom line, it is. Subtle, subtle unseen racism, unintentional.''
</P>
<P>
   For Henderson, the message had credence, the messenger did not.
``Bryan is one of those people who see racism in everything they
don't like,'' Henderson said. ``If it goes against them, it's
racism. Racism is a hot button.''
</P>
<P>
   But Washington, who played in the NFL for 10 years, took a
broader, slightly more compassionate view. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the bigger picture is that things like this are a
manifestation of a bigger issue,'' Washington said. ``This is just
sort of a lightening rod. We're sort of insignificant players in
this deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me the question is, `Are things getting better?'''
Washington added. ``I think they are. To show you how old I am,
when I broke in in 1969, black cornerbacks were a rarity. Forget
trying to be coaches; we just wanted to be able to play certain
positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Cox's criticism about blacks being pitted against
blacks, Washington said: ``It comes with the territory. If you're a
black person, in a job like Harold's or in my job, it comes with
the territory and you have to be able to handle it.'' &QL;

FDA TO LET BIOSTAR MARKET FLU TEST KIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo.)   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Biota Holdings Ltd. said Wednesday that its collaborator,
Biostar Inc., had received clearance from the Food and Drug
Administration to begin marketing the first rapid diagnostic test
kit for flu.
</P>
<P>
   Biostar, based in Boulder, Colo., will market the kit in the
United States, Europe and New Zealand, sharing profits with Biota,
a biotech company based in Melbourne, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Biostar has not yet set a price for the test, which can be
performed in doctors' offices in less than 15 minutes, using
samples from saliva, mucus or a throat swab.
</P>
<P>
   Biota said clinical studies showed the test's sensitivity
approached or surpassed conventional methods that can take several
days to provide results.
</P>
<P>
   Although there would be some benefit now for patients to know
whether their symptoms are from flu or a common cold, the real
significance of the test will come next year with the expected
approval of new influenza drugs.

<P>
   EVERETT, Wash. _ For all the talk of Microsoft exercising global
dominance from the empire's capital here in the Seattle area, most
residents know that the big engine for jobs in the region remains
Boeing Co., the nation's largest exporter, whose 100,000-strong
local work force is eight times the size of Microsoft's.
</P>
<P>
   The airplane behemoth is the region's biggest employer,
providing good jobs for tens of thousands of blue-collar workers,
whose strong union has secured the kinds of wages that enable many
workers to afford fishing boats and second homes in the Pacific
Northwest mountains.
</P>
<P>
   So when the company announced Tuesday that it was cutting 20
percent of its worldwide work force over the next two years _
20,000 jobs in addition to the 28,000 it had announced in July _
with many of those cuts planned for the Seattle area, the news hit
like a chill winter wind.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, one of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow Jones
industrial average, fell 16.7 percent, or $6.6875, to $33.6875
Wednesday in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The Dow was
down 69 points for the day.
</P>
<P>
   The chief factor cited by Boeing for the company's downturn, the
Asian recession, continues to hammer at the local economy in other
ways as well: exports of all non-aircraft products from this
heavily trade-dependent state are down more than 30 percent in the
last year, state economists say. And while exporters here see signs
that Asia's problems may be easing, those projections seem to
provide little consolation for Boeing workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see any quick turnaround,'' said Thomas Plummer, 49,
an aircraft test technician on the production line for the 747
jumbo jet, as he finished the graveyard shift early Wednesday
morning. ``I mean, even if things get better over there, I can't
see Asian airlines rushing out and saying, `Hey, let's buy a lot of
big planes to celebrate.' You're talking $180 million or so for a
fully loaded 747. That's a serious chunk of change.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Moe, 35, a wing mechanic who was laid off for four years
in the early 1990s and fears a similar fate now, agreed. ``You've
got to think, how many planes do we already have sitting in the
desert with no customers,'' he said, referring to a collection of
sparkling new wide-bodied jets that are indeed parked there because
various airlines, most from Asia, have not been able to pay for
their orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd like to think there was something you could do, work
harder, whatever'' to stem the company's problems, he added. ``But
what can you do? It's out of your hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The job cuts represent a potentially serious blow to the
region's economy, especially because the rough rule of thumb is
that every job at Boeing creates about three other jobs, directly,
in related businesses like suppliers, or indirectly, in stores and
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   No one here seems to think that things will be anywhere near as
dire as the 1970s, when the company cut nearly two-thirds of its
work force amid a global recession and a notorious sign directed
the last person leaving Seattle to turn off all the lights. But
they are a worrying sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the last Boeing slump, in '91-93, the state
economy held up pretty well, because of other areas, obviously the
high-tech area, but also timber and agriculture as well,'' said
Charles Hill, a professor at the University of Washington's school
of business administration. ``The problem now, of course, is that
timber and agriculture are Asian-dependent. Go figure. I think
it'll hurt us.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill and others noted that the Boeing announcement seemed almost
strangely late. ``I'm not surprised, I'm surprised that people are
surprised,'' he said. ``I think this has been in the cards for 12
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moment those economies hit the skids,'' he said, referring
to Asia, ``this was in the cards.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Whitlow, an analyst with Safeco Asset Management who
follows Boeing and who serves on Gov. Gary Locke's Council of
Economic Advisers, said the company ``seems to be the last one to
figure out how bad it would be'' in Asia. Even with the signs that
the economies are bouncing back, he said, there is no short-term
good news for Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it just takes time,'' said Whitlow. ``It will be three
or four years before you see much of an improvement in deliveries
to Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone here thinks that all of Boeing's problems can be
traced to Asia. In Wednesday's edition of the online magazine
Slate, published by Microsoft, James Surowiecki wrote: ``While in
part these cutbacks represent an aggressive response to a sharp
falloff in demand from Asia, they're also the result of a failure
of management _ production line inefficiencies, mismanaged capacity
and poor forecasting. Boeing needs a new approach, and job-cutting
alone isn't it.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing officials said Wednesday that they had renegotiated many
contracts with major suppliers and were taking other cost-saving
measures, which they portrayed as helping to ease the problems
caused by the fall-off in Asian demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things that we can't control, like the Asian
crisis,'' said Bob Jorgensen, a Boeing spokesman. ``We work on
things we can control, and because of those savings those cuts
won't be as deep.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some of the unionized workers coming off their shift early
Wednesday morning also said they were suspicious that the cutbacks
represent a bargaining threat for the upcoming battle between the
company and the aerospace workers union over a new contract. The
current one is scheduled to expire next September.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, when the current contract was ratified after a
69-day strike, workers claimed a major victory for organized labor,
including wage increases of about 10 percent and protection of many
health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The bitterness over the negotiations quickly subsided, as the
nation and the company enjoyed a huge economic boom. Amid a surge
in demand for Boeing planes, the company made big payments for
overtime work, hired more workers (21,000 people in 1996 and 17,000
last year), and pleaded with some retirees to come back to the
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, the fear is that the boom times are over. And
while no specific individuals have yet received layoff notices,
everyone knows they're coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``You live in this bubble, waiting for the news,'' said Rolf
Vitous, 34, an electrical systems installer who has been with the
company for two and a half years. ``You don't go out and buy a new
car, you don't buy a lot of Christmas presents, you definitely
don't go and buy a new house. You lie in the bubble and wait. ``
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has jobs in more than half the states in the country,
including about 42,000 in southern California, making it one of the
largest single private employers in that region. But its presence
in Seattle and its environs is huge, and because this is the
production site for most of the wide-bodied jets for which Asian
airlines have reduced orders, everyone knows there will be
significant job cutbacks here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a boom-and-bust business, and Boeing people understand
the cyclical nature of it,'' said Plummer, the test technician.
``But that doesn't help when you go home and your spouse says,
`Honey, are you going to have a job tomorrow?' ''
</P>
<P>
   While distressed about the job cuts, workers here did not seem
particularly angry at Boeing management, nor did they blame the
Asian airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not really their fault,'' said Vitous. ``If you order up
a shiny new pick-up truck and then you lose your job, you don't
still go out and buy the truck. Well, it's sort of the same thing
for them, though we're talking about wide-bodied jets.''

SOTHEBY'S AUCTION IS SOMETHING ELSE ENTIRELY 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By MARGARETT LOKE  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An auction of American Indian art at Sotheby's in
Manhattan turned out to be less of an auction than expected
Wednesday, after protests by several Indian tribes that argued that
their cultural heritage should not be sold into private hands.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen of the objects, including six that several tribes had
asked to be removed from the auction block, were withdrawn by the
auction house or the consignors.
</P>
<P>
   Three other objects that Indians had also requested be withdrawn
from the sale _ a Plains ceremonial club, a Yurok ceremonial dance
apron and a 16th or 17th century Aleut wood mask _ were bought by
three people who wanted the items returned to the tribes.
</P>
<P>
   The 19 objects were pulled from the sale at the last minute
because of unresolved legal issues. In some cases, consignors may
not have notified the tribes who are claiming the items.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, items were withdrawn because the auction house
had not determined whether the feathers on them were covered by a
1916 act regulating the sale of feathers from certain migratory
birds.
</P>
<P>
   Among those items was an early bentwood hunting hat from the
Aleut Indians, an Eskimo tribe. Representatives of the tribe had
protested the hat's sale, arguing that it was part of a lost
cultural tradition that the Aleuts were struggling to maintain.
</P>
<P>
   The hat's consignor, Adelaide de Menil, and her husband, the
anthropologist Edmund Carpenter, had rejected requests to withdraw
the hat and other items, saying that they feared the objects would
not be properly cared for by the tribes.
</P>
<P>
   An Eskimo wood mask also consigned by Ms. de Menil and sought by
the Aleuts was purchased by a California woman, Anne Bleecker
Corcos, for $46,000. Ms. Corcos, the head of a nonprofit
organization that supports American Indian issues, said she planned
to return the mask to the Aleuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a personal thing,'' she said. ``I feel it's important for
native Americans to receive these things back, especially those of
ceremonial and spiritual value.''
</P>
<P>
   Ann Rockefeller Roberts, president of Fund of the Four
Directories, a small nonprofit organization that offers grants to
native American causes, bought the Yurok apron for $11,500. She did
it, she said, ``because this is an object that the Yurok nation has
identified as sacred to their spiritual practices and cultural
lineage.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Gutstein, an administrator at IBM headquarters in
Armonk, bought a Plains ceremonial club for $7,475 that the Fort
Peck Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of Montana had asked be withdrawn
from auction.
</P>
<P>
   ``My interest,'' he said, ``was to return it to its owners. It's
a ritual object that has meaning to its community and serves a
binding role _ it binds the community to each other, to its past
and present, and provides a foundation to move to the future.''
</P>
<P>
   A three-member delegation of Aleuts from the Aleutian/Pribilof
Islands Association that had flown in from Alaska for the sale
expressed pleasure at the outcome Wednesday. ``We are finally
breaking the ice and working toward gathering items _ spiritual,
ritual and cultural items,'' said Dimitri Philemonof, who heads the
association.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the wood mask that would be returned to the Aleuts,
Allison A. Young, cultural heritage director of the association,
said, ``There are no words to describe the joy the people in the
region will feel when they see the ancestral object.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Quietly and behind the scenes Wednesday, the lines were drawn
between those who support the Indians' right to repossess their
sacred objects and those who believe that Indian objects in private
hands should remain so.
</P>
<P>
   In the former camp is Elizabeth Sackler, who orchestrated the
purchase of the three items. Ms. Sackler, the daughter of the
antiquities collector Arthur M. Sackler, is the founder and
president of the Manhattan-based American Indian Ritual Object
Repatriation Foundation. She created the foundation after another
American Indian auction at Sotheby's in 1991, where she bought and
returned to the tribes three masks _ two Hopi and one Navajo _ that
the Indians considered sacred and had asked be withdrawn from the
sale.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side was Carpenter, who said that he was
``saddened'' by the auction's direction. ``Disgust is too
positive,'' he said. ``It's a sad scene.'' He deplored a 1990
Federal statute that provides for the return of many Indian objects
returning to the tribes, but makes no provision for housing or
caring for the objects.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I,'' he said, ``have been vigilant in protecting
these objects for future generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter said he is dismayed that the Aleuts have not
vigorously pursued the return of Indian items from museums covered
by the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of
1990, which requires federally financed institutions to list their
Indian holdings and to work with Indian tribes on the return of
their human remains, ritual objects and items of cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. de Menil had consigned a number of native American materials
to the Sotheby's auction, he said, after deciding to close down her
collection. The majority of the pieces were going to the De Menil
Museum in Houston, which specializes in surrealism, he said _
objects that were visual puns and that represented the coexistence
of contraries.
</P>
<P>
   He met with the Aleut delegation on Tuesday evening soon after
they arrived in New York, he said, and described the meeting as
friendly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept insisting that there be standards of protection and
scholarship,'' Carpenter said.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter said that he believes that ``auction houses are being
blackballed and blackmailed.'' He added, ``All they're succeeding
in doing is driving this whole thing underground where information
will be lost _ and to what end?''

BIG OIL DEALS RAISE PRESSURE ON TEXACO

<TEXT>
<P>
   With Exxon and Mobil deciding to join forces in the biggest
corporate merger ever, the pressure on other major oil companies to
find partners intensified Wednesday _ something acknowledged by
Peter I. Bijur, the chairman and chief executive of Texaco Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Badgered at a meeting with Wall Street analysts about how
Texaco, the No. 3 oil company, could compete against the
Exxon-Mobil goliath, Bijur announced a cost-cutting program
intended to save $600 million by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that Texaco would not be goaded into a marriage
with another rival. But he did not totally rule out such an
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Bijur said during the meeting at Texaco's corporate headquarters
in White Plains, N.Y., that recent merger announcements left
``absolutely no doubt that the landscape of the international
petroleum business is changing.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that he had assumed crude oil prices would run in
the $19-a-barrel range this year and not at the 12-year low of $11
a barrel reached in recent days. The 41 percent plunge in oil
prices over the past year is a major reason for the consolidation
in the petroleum industry.
</P>
<P>
   Bijur repeatedly emphasized that Texaco was prepared to go it
alone and compete with the new giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think bigger is better. I think excellence is
better,'' he said. But he also said that ``I never say never to
anything'' and that ``nothing is off the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Texaco fell $2.8125 to $54 Wednesday, reflecting broad
pessimism about the profit outlook for petroleum companies with no
prospect that oil prices will rise anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Texaco, with $45.2 billion in sales last year, would trail far
behind the new collosus of Exxon Mobil, which had combined sales of
$201.6 billion last year, and other giants like Royal/Dutch Shell
Group and British Petroleum, now in the process of taking over
Amoco Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Bijur said there were other ways, short of mergers, that large
corporations can achieve cost savings and build their market
presence.
</P>
<P>
   Texaco has formed two alliances with Shell Oil Co. to combine a
large part of its refining and marketing in the United States,
which will make it the largest refining unit in the country,
accounting for about 15 percent of gasoline and motor oil sales.
</P>
<P>
   Another alliance with Shell and Saudi Refining Inc. will combine
refining and marketing in the Eastern United States. Bijur said the
alliances have cut a combined 2,000 jobs; 870 have been from
Texaco.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the two arrangements ``were already doing'' what
Exxon and Mobil plan to do.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking about Texaco's cost cutting, Bijur said the company's
corporate center in White Plains will shed a fifth of its work
force or 100 jobs; the resulting free space will be leased out.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the company's exploration and production units
would also cut 1,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Those reductions, combined with cuts in other operations, he
added, would save the company about $400 million next year and that
the savings would grow to $600 million by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged, however, that in exploration and production, a
company combining two partners like Exxon and Mobil has more of a
presence. ``I`d like to have a larger base of opportunity,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the lower oil prices also are forcing suppliers to
cut costs and rivals are being weakened. ``We are ready to take
advantage of any bargains which may appear in the marketplace,'' he
added, an indication Texaco might look for acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Oil companies have been able to ride out the downturn in crude
prices in part because they have been able to feed their refineries
with cheaper crude while prices of gasoline and other refined
products have been slower to come down.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Texaco's earnings from production of crude fell by about
$700 million in the first nine months this year while earnings in
refining and marketing were up by $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company has also put off spending on some of its projects;
capital spending for the year will total about $4 billion, down 13
percent from the $4.6 billion that had been planned.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates,
said that the latest mergers among big oil companies define a new
niche in size, ambition and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the formula for success?'' he said. ``Becoming a
super-major that can think long-term and still deliver the returns
that shareholders demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Smaller, independent oil producers are also having to decide
whether to consolidate or cut back or both.
</P>
<P>
   Union Pacific Resources said Wednesday that it would cut its
headquarters staff in Fort Worth, Texas, by 20 percent, or more
than 200 jobs. ``We've just joined the parade of companies taking
similar actions,'' said Dan Sullivan, a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Union Pacific's hostile bid last year for Pennzoil, another
independent producer, failed. This year, Union Pacific bought
Norcen Energy Resources for $2.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Exxon employees who would be at risk in a merger are
the 460 at the Florham Park, N.J., headquarters of Exxon Company
International, which manages operations outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon said Wednesday that some would move to Houston, where the
combined company's exploration and production would be based, and
some would move to Fairfax, Va., the base for refining and
marketing. A number still to be determined would lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon and Mobil appear most likely to face challenges over their
concentration of gas stations in the Northeast. Together, they own
35.1 percent of the gas stations in Washington, 26.2 percent in New
Jersey, 22.2 percent in New York and 21.5 percent in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   But, as a sign of the companies' resolve to complete their deal,
their agreement includes a huge, $1.5 billion termination fee.
Subject to a number of conditions, whichever company backed away
would have to pay that amount to the other.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the break-up fee, Exxon is also entitled to buy as much
as 14.9 percent of Mobils stock if another company makes Mobil an
offer.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will also be reviewed by European regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Globally, the combined company will also prove a much stronger
competitor in natural gas. Mobil especially has been at work on
liquefaction plants and other projects that are making natural gas
a commodity capable of being traded among nations.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference Tuesday, Lee R. Raymond, the Exxon chief
executive, said that the deal could prove as significant for the
development of natural gas as for oil.
</P>
<P>
   If so, the company could become an even stronger rival for Enron
Corp., the Houston company intent on becoming for the global
natural gas business what Exxon has been for oil.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chief executive, said Wednesday that his
company would still have proprietary strengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we fearful of the combination?'' he said. ``No. They're
much more driven to the exploration and production side of the
business.'' Enron has concentrated more on distribution, marketing
and trading, often backing power plants to use the natural gas
supplies.

GATES CLAIMS IGNORANCE OF MICROSOFT-SUN BATTLE OVER JAVA 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In excerpts from a videotaped deposition played in
federal court Wednesday, Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft Corp.,
professed general ignorance of his company's legal battles with Sun
Microsystems Inc. over Sun's Java programming language.
</P>
<P>
   Asked under oath on Aug. 29 if he was familiar with a civil
lawsuit that Sun had recently filed accusing Microsoft of violating
its contract to use Java, Gates paused for nearly 30 seconds before
replying, ``Not really.'' Later he said with a shrug, ``I read
something about it on our Web site four days ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The questioning in August was in the form of a sworn deposition
taken by the Justice Department for the government's lawsuit
accusing Microsoft of predatory business practices that violated
antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   The trial turned Wednesday to the company's difficult
relationship with Sun, which created and owns Java, a programming
language that could in theory threaten the domination by
Microsoft's Windows of the market for personal computer operating
systems. Microsoft licensed Java from Sun three years ago but then
wrote its own version of the language, which is in some ways
incompatible with Sun's original.
</P>
<P>
   Sun sued, claiming that Microsoft's changes violated its
licensing agreement. Two weeks ago, a federal judge in California
ordered Microsoft to make its version of Java compatible with Sun's
version within 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   In the antitrust case, the government is trying to show that
Microsoft's battles with Sun are part of a broad pattern of
illegal, predatory behavior intended to protect its Windows
operating system monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Through a long day of testimony, live and videotaped, Microsoft
presented two faces. On videotape, Gates seemed largely unconcerned
by Sun, though at one point he said that Java ``might be evolved in
the future'' into a competitive threat. But in live questioning, a
Microsoft lawyer, Tom Burt, tried to force James Gosling, the Sun
executive who created Java, into saying that Sun intended to mount
a deadly threat against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Burt displayed memos and e-mail from Sun executives describing
ambitions to challenge Microsoft using Java.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charge! Kill Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Microsoft and Apple all at
once'' using Java, Sun's chief executive, Scott McNealy, wrote in
one e-mail message, according to a newsletter entered into
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Joy, another Sun executive, wrote in 1995 that ``Java gives
Sun a chance to break away from the Microsoft monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gosling seemed amused by that and other exuberant statements
by Sun executives over the years. And when Burt asked him if Sun
wanted to take over ``100 percent of the computer market,'' Gosling
chuckled before responding, ``I think we would be happy if we
achieved two orders of magnitude less than that,'' or 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's goal in court was to suggest that it could not be
considered an enduring monopoly if it was threatened by aggressive
competitors like Sun. The government can make few of its charges
stick if Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson does not conclude that
Microsoft is a monopoly as defined by federal law.
</P>
<P>
   While it is not illegal to have a monopoly, a company with a
recognized monopoly is barred from employing predatory practices to
maintain its domination of a market.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Burt's strategy, however, Gates seemed wholly
unconcerned by Sun and Java.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the Aug. 28 deposition, David Boies, the
government's lead lawyer, asked Gates, ``Did you ever try to find
out what Microsoft is charged with, what they're alleged to have
done wrong?''
</P>
<P>
   In a casual tone, Gates responded that he had asked Paul Maritz,
a senior Microsoft executive: ```Do I need to learn about this
lawsuit? Do I need to spend a lot of time on it?' He said, no, he's
focused on it, and I can focus on other things.''
</P>
<P>
   But then Boies presented e-mail to Gates from others in his
company last year showing that they were quite concerned with Sun
and Java _ particularly since Java was a significant component of
the World Wide Web browser made by Netscape Communications Corp.,
Microsoft's chief competitor in Internet software. And in an e-mail
entered into evidence earlier in the trial, Gates once remarked
that Java ``scares the hell out of me.''
</P>
<P>
   In one e-mail introduced Wednesday, Maritz wrote to Gates: ``If
we looked further at Java being our major threat, then Netscape is
the major distribution vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates said he could not recall that e-mail, adding that ``Maritz
may or may not have agreed'' with the notions he was describing.
</P>
<P>
   In another message to Gates last year, a Microsoft executive,
Todd Nielson, wrote, ``We are proactively trying to put obstacles
in Sun's path and get anyone that wants to write in Java to use
J/Direct,'' Microsoft's version of the language for Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Gates said he did not recall the message, adding, ``I don't know
what it means.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft issued a statement Wednesday defending Gates'
responses and criticizing the government for playing the video of
the deposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gates' performance reflects his adherence to the instructions
lawyers routinely give their clients who are being deposed,'' it
said.

SPORTS COLUMN: TORRE FITS AS THE TOAST OF THE TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He arrived fashionably late, the celebrity way, and
his entrance created a most suitable stir. Joe Torre, in the house.
Lights. Camera. Reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at the Rockland Business Association last night,'' Torre
said Wednesday at the Waldorf-Astoria, in his casual,
conversational way. ``Must have been 350 people. I got up to speak
and said, `Is there anybody I didn't take a picture with?' A few
raised their hands, and I said, `Well, come back to the house after
this and we'll take care of you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Who wouldn't want to go back to the house with Joe Torre, and,
more to the point, who couldn't imagine sitting in his living room,
accepting an offer for a glass of iced tea?
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, it was the Rockland martini crowd. Wednesday, the
March of Dimes Sportsman of the Year luncheon. Pick a date from the
time the Yankees finished off the San Diego Padres for their second
World Series championship in the three years since Torre became a
homespun New York story. Chances are, the Yankees' manager was
somewhere, making a speech, taping a show, lighting a tree.
</P>
<P>
   Maury Gostfrand, the booking agent from RLR Associates, faxed
over the November itinerary from Joe Torre's Wonderful Life. Nov.
6: cameo role in the sitcom ``Spin City.'' Nov. 11: the Children of
Chernobyl gala dinner. Nov. 12: photo shoot for the cover of New
York magazine. Nov. 18: Starlight Foundation sports auction. Nov.
19: speech at Western Connecticut University. Nov. 23: speech at
Adelphi University. Nov. 26: Thanksgiving Day parade. Nov. 30:
Christmas tree lighting for the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we won the World Series, and we got a taste of it two
years ago, but you can't imagine how many people it impacts,''
Torre said. ``It's overwhelming at times. With me, probably what
they latch on to more than anything is that I'm from New York, like
family, a lot closer than just an acquaintance.''
</P>
<P>
   It is more than his being from Brooklyn that explains the
transformation of a man a city tabloid once called Clueless Joe
into the aforementioned magazine cover. This is about a rare
knockout victory these days for substance over style.
</P>
<P>
   We loved the idea of having Pat Riley play Michael Douglas on
the sideline at Madison Square Garden, but ultimately viewed him as
a man we couldn't make eye contact with. We are awed by the
coaching majesty of Bill Parcells but intuitively know we wouldn't
want to run into him on the Monday after he'd lost.
</P>
<P>
   Torre, in addition to being the soothing, supervisory presence
of the most decorated Yankee team ever, has become, in many
respects, the paternal face of New York sports.
</P>
<P>
   When self-promotion is continually forced down our throats, when
it is difficult to separate the man from the spin, Torre has come
to represent a self-assured, comfortable fit. We are not fascinated
with his hair, not bullied by his bluster. We just like the idea of
a man who has a Brooklyn little league named for him, not only as a
manager of the rich professionals, but also as a model for those
who would coach our kids.
</P>
<P>
   He stepped out of the cab Wednesday on Park Avenue, into the
breezy warmth of what still feels like October, and saw the smiles
on the faces of the delighted New Yorkers. ``You keep hearing:
`Hey, Joe. Hey, Joe,''' he said. He laughed and added, ``Enjoy it
while it's here,'' so whimsically you knew that when the attention
is gone, he'll manage just fine.
</P>
<P>
   He sounded, in this moment, like a throwback, like one of the
city's championship coaches lost in the very month Torre was making
the ceremonial rounds. He recalled meeting Red Holzman and Weeb
Ewbank only in passing, but ``choking up'' when he heard what the
players, from Joe Namath to Willis Reed, had to say. ``The thing I
always admired about those guys is how the players perceived
them,'' Torre said. ``You can't make people do that. That respect
only comes from it being a two-way street.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 25 years since Holzman's Knicks won their second title,
the communications explosion allows even a regular Joe like Torre
to become a star, to have a television movie made about him and his
brother, to have published a book with another on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody begrudges Torre what he seems to enjoy as an out-of-body
experience. ``I never expected the adulation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Torre never expected to be shaking hands into December. He left
the Waldorf on Wednesday and went to the airport for a long-awaited
family vacation. ``This is it,'' he said. ``The end.''
</P>
<P>
   He meant of 1998. This unlikely epic continues next year.

NBA OWNERS AND PLAYERS SET FOR PIVOTAL TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the season continues to slip away, National
Basketball Association players and owners will meet Thursday in
Manhattan for the first time in 13 days to try to end the
five-month-old lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're beyond the part of being frustrated,'' said
Michael Curry, a member of the union's negotiating committee. ``By
no means do we want the season canceled. But at the same time, if
it comes to accepting a bad deal or letting the owners lose the
season, unfortunately, we have to let the owners cancel the
season.''
</P>
<P>
   The last meeting on Nov. 20 was termed the most productive
bargaining session by both sides after it broke up after 10 hours.
Within 48 hours, all progress was shelved.
</P>
<P>
   The union was upset about an owners' proposal that would
severely limit a team's ability to sign its own free agents. The
owners then accused the union of reneging on its acceptance of a
complex tax formula that was to be used as part of an escrow system
in the final years of a proposed seven-year plan.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two weeks of rhetoric later, they're back at the
bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   Having set an unofficial mid-December deadline for striking a
deal and having tested the union's resolve for the past month _ a
period in which more than 200 players did not receive two paychecks
_ the owners may have a renewed urgency in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But the union is feeling the pressure, too. In particular, the
union's executive director, Billy Hunter, has had his job
performance questioned by Isiah Thomas, a former union leader, over
the past week. The former Bulls coach, Phil Jackson, said Wednesday
he had reservations about the players' leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very concerned about the representation on the players
side,'' Jackson said from his home in Chicago. ``It looks like it's
being directed by a couple of agents. I know there's some
bitterness there, too. I've talked to some players _ players who
are not your $10 million and $20 million players _ that do not feel
like they have enough power to speak out because they don't have
the clout.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson added: ``I think there's a certain limited amount of
perspective some of these players have. They see their own era
perhaps, they see their own careers, they see their own ability to
compete. But they don't see a game that their children may play. I
don't miss basketball, but for the good of the game it's very
disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said a mediator should be brought in to help the two
sides settle their dispute, a suggestion the league has shot down
on at least two occasions.
</P>
<P>
   The most difficult hurdle may be whether the escrow tax system
can be saved.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was designed to make sure owners recouped revenues in
the fourth year of the deal in the event that an agreed-upon
percentage of money paid out in player salaries was exceeded.
</P>
<P>
   The union had previously proposed setting aside 10 percent of
their paychecks in the escrow years, but the owners want to make
sure the difference is completely covered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have to go a totally different direction with the
format,'' Deputy Commissioner Russ Granik said on Tuesday.
``Hopefully, we won't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we would probably be inclined to stay with the same
framework,'' Hunter said. ``I don't really think that we can move
away under the circumstances _ unless they come up with something
really magnificent.''
</P>
<P>
   Though neither the league nor the union is predicting progress,
Hunter was hopeful negotiations might spill over into Friday. He
told the players on the negotiating committee that they should plan
to be in New York for two days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see it going into Friday if there's progress, but only
if we're moving,'' he said. ``We're not going to go through the
motions and sit across the table and look at each other.'' &QL;

<P>
   (Kansas City, Mo.) _ Black civic leaders at a national summit
Tuesday in Kansas City stressed the need for better urban schools
and better opportunities for minority-owned businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The summit, sponsored by the National Black Caucus of Local
Elected Officials, took place in conjunction with this week's
National League of Cities annual convention.
</P>
<P>
   The caucus intends to develop an ``urban platform'' by the end
of the week to present to national leaders. And education is
expected to be a key issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get people to move to your city if you don't have a
good education system,'' said John Saunders, executive director of
the National Forum for Black Public Administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders said that with good urban schools, minorities could be
trained to operate their own businesses in their own communities. A
well-educated, self-reliant urban community would ease some of the
disadvantages of central-city life, such as poverty and crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to bring it (entrepreneurship) back to our own
communities,'' Saunders said.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Williams, president of the Joint Center for Political and
Economic Studies, said cities needed more federal empowerment zones
to spur economic development. Williams also suggested that black
businesses receive more assistance from local governments.
</P>
<P>
   Edna Bell, president of the National Association of Black County
Officials, said urban areas had high rates of juvenile
incarceration. She called for more family-based programs to combat
substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Bell said that substance-abuse prevention programs like as DARE
(Drug Abuse Resistance Education) don't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to pay attention to what works, not what sells,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar Eason Jr., president of Blacks in Government, said that
political attacks on affirmative-action laws in Washington, D.C.,
and California were making it difficult for minorities to get
better educations and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick in certain areas now is to maintain diversity
without using race-based recruitment,'' Eason said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But how can employers and contracting officials grant minority
job applicants and contractors documented opportunities without
being able to specify who is to be assisted?...To affirmatively
recruit minorities in Washington and California is to violate the
law.''
</P>
<P>
   William Spriggs, director of research and policy for the
National Urban League, said an economic policy that benefited
minorities was needed, although blacks were faring better today
than during the Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must have a proper economic policy in place,'' Spriggs
said.

JUDICIARY COMMITTEEC PULLS BACK FROM PLAN TO WIDEN INQUIRY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Judiciary Committee, under fire on many
fronts for abruptly expanding the impeachment inquiry, quickly
began to pull back Wednesday night after the panel gained limited
access to secret FBI and Justice Department documents that detail
alleged fund-raising abuses in President Clinton's 1996 reelection
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours after impeachment, investigators reviewed the
documents, the Judiciary Committee staff alerted members that it is
unlikely to serve subpoenas that the panel had approved the day
before to compel testimony from the FBI director, Louis J. Freeh,
and a former top Justice Department official.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the committee's Republican majority informed members
that all other depositions of potential witnesses are on hold and
likely to be canceled.
</P>
<P>
   That could remove the final obstacles to the committee debating
and voting next week on GOP proposals for as many as three or more
articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign that the committee is prepared to wrap up the
expanded inquiry, the panel last night tentatively scheduled final
presentations by Clinton's lawyers and committee investigators next
Tuesday and Wednesday, with debate and votes to follow Thursday
through Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Committee sources said the moves indicate investigators who
reviewed the Justice Department documents Wednesday uncovered no
substantial evidence of impeachable offenses that would warrant a
protracted investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The subpoenas for Freeh and Charles G. LaBella, the former chief
of the Justice Department's campaign finance task force, directly
related to the fund-raising inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee chairman, Henry J. Hyde, had no
immediate comment on the contents of the documents, which included
recommendations from Freeh and LaBella that Attorney General Janet
Reno seek an independent counsel to investigate Clinton's 1996
fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   But the panel's highest ranking Democrat, Representative John
Conyers Jr. of Michigan, said, ``Democratic counsel has thoroughly
examined the memoranda in question and has advised me that nothing
in these documents is in any way relevant to this committee's
consideration of possible impeachable offenses by the president. We
trust that this closes a short and unproductive chapter in the
history of this very strange proceeding.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel's likely withdrawal of the committee's other subpoenas
_ for Clinton's lawyer, Robert S. Bennett, and close adviser, Bruce
R. Lindsey _ also indicates the panel sees no merit in further
pursuing an allegation by former White House volunteer Kathleen
Willey that Clinton groped her near the Oval Office in 1993,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment case, by most accounts, is expected to end where
it began, with the committee focusing on allegations by the
independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr.
</P>
<P>
   He charged that Clinton may have committed perjury, witness
tampering, obstruction of justice, and abuse of his office in
trying to conceal his sexual relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Representative W. Asa Hutchinson, an Arkansas Republican who
serves on the Judiciary Committee, defended the panel's search for
evidence of fund-raising crimes, saying it would be irresponsible
not to pursue a lead that investigators had received on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it most likely won't go anywhere,'' Hutchinson said.
``What we should concentrate on is the referral we received, and
the allegations of perjury and obstruction of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The day before, Clinton's spokesman, Joe Lockhart, had blasted
the Judiciary Committee as being ``hijacked by extremists.'' But
the White House last night informed the panel that Clinton's
lawyers ``will of course accept your invitation to appear before
the committee and to present a defense on behalf of the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde had set Wednesday as a deadline for Clinton's legal defense
team to request an appearance.
</P>
<P>
   However, Clinton lawyers issued several conditional requests for
their appearance, including gaining access to all the material the
committee has received or reviewed since expanding the inquiry
beyond the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is plain that the scope of the defense must equal the scope
of the inquiry,'' wrote White House counsel Charles F.C. Ruff and
special counsel Gregory B. Craig. ``Once we have reviewed the
material, we will be prepared to present a vigorous defense of the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   The moves to apparently rein in the burgeoning inquiry came
after US District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson struck a compromise
between the Judiciary Committee, which had subpoenaed the
confidential Justice Department documents, and Reno, who said the
material included secret grand jury information that would be
illegal to unseal.
</P>
<P>
   But the developments also followed increasing attacks on the
committee, even from within Republican ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Among those blasting the panel's GOP lawmakers for expanding the
inquiry was Representative Christopher Shays of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``We let this out of the box, but we don't know how to get it
back in, and it has blown up in our face,'' Shays said in an
interview. ``The republic is suffering, not just the Republican
Party.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the FBI and Justice Department documents, Johnson
permitted two Judiciary Committee investigators _ one each for
Republicans and Democrats _ to read them and report their findings
to Hyde and Conyers. The investigators were not allowed to copy the
documents or take notes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a potentially key player in the impeachment saga, the
House Rules Committee chairman, Gerald B. Solomon of New York, said
through a spokesman, Mike Powers, that the outgoing speaker, Newt
Gingrich, has told him he does not plan to play a leadership role
in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich is ``interested, but he's not engaged,'' Solomon said
through Powers. ``He's left it to the incoming leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   The speaker-designate, Robert L. Livingston of Louisiana, has
said he plans to steer clear of the impeachment fray until the
Judiciary Committee completes its business.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon also left open the possibility that the Rules Committee
would permit the full House to vote on a censure, even if the
Judiciary Committee blocks such a move, as Hyde has said he is
likely to do.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Barney Frank, a Newton Democrat, said Solomon's
possible willingness to approve a censure resolution indicated that
some GOP leaders may be maneuvering for an alternative because
polls show that the public opposes Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Common sense may be somewhat reasserting itself,'' Frank said.
</P>
<P>
   Powers, Solomon's spokesman, said the possible willingness to
consider a censure proposal ``is in no way a Solomon prescription''
to resolve the impeachment issue.

THE PROBLEM? PEOPLE, NOT CAPITALISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star   The proliferation of global economic
problems is fueling a misguided backlash of blame directed toward
free markets and free enterprise.
<TEXT>
<P>
   When liberal economists and media analysts assess the woe
betiding Asia, Russia and Latin America and ponder the reckless
blunders of high-octane hedge funds, they seem eager to conclude
that all this trouble is evidence of market failure.
</P>
<P>
   The Media Research Center's MediaNomics report recently cited as
an example of the phenomenon a Time magazine article calling ``an
unfettered global market a dangerous gamble.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with such perspectives, MediaNomics said, is that
viewing the global market as ``unfettered'' is a misperception.
Most, if not all, of the worst problems besetting troubled
economies is that they have been messed up more by political
manipulation than by adherence to market principles.
</P>
<P>
   Nobel laureate economist Milton Friedman made the same point in
The New York Times recently when challenged by a columnist to
explain the apparent widespread failure of market economics.
Friedman said most problems were not due to market failure but
rather the result of bad government policy and bad advice from the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a tendency when things go wrong to blame the
private market,'' said this generation's staunchest advocate of
free enterprise. ``Given that we've had these difficulties, there's
no doubt we'll have some backsliding'' on the road to what's an
inexorable movement toward greater individual freedom and less
government influence on economies.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Robert A. Sirico, president of the Action Institute for
the Study of Religion and Liberty, characterized editorial
criticism of markets as ``flawed economic analysis (with) a
generous dollop of redistributionist ethics'' in an essay for The
Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   What is happening, he said, ``is not institutional failure, but
human failure.'' What's needed, Sirico asserted, is more market
discipline from the system known as ``profit and loss.'' Much of
the world's woe, he said, is the result of audacious gambles taken
by those expecting friends in high places to bail them out if
investments go sour.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing wrong with the market economy that an
enhancement of market signaling cannot correct,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the left-liberal's
resurgent criticism of market economics is the absence of
alternative proposals. If free enterprise capitalism is inadequate
to meet human economic needs, what's the answer? Communism?
Socialism? Fascism? Syndicalism? Corporatism?
</P>
<P>
   All have been tried and found not only inadequate but, at their
worst, destructive. Why? People usually act in their self-interest,
whether they're crafting government policy or seeking their fortune
in the marketplace. When self-interested officials gain power to
impose their will on others, this power corrupts them _ sometimes
to the point of homicidal megalomania.
</P>
<P>
   The good news, Friedman said, is that the champions of
individual liberty are winning. Their greatest weapon in the fight
to shrink government power, he predicts, will be the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it harder to collect taxes.''

   LOS ANGELES _ USC offensive lineman Matt Welch has been cleared
to play after tests revealed he experienced nothing more than a
rapid heart rate against Notre Dame last week.
</P>

   Welch was examined after being forced to leave Saturday's game
after experiencing a rapid heart rate. USC coach Paul Hackett said
it was a pre-existing condition. Tests done at USC University
Hospital detected no further problems, and Welch's heart rate

WORLD BANK REPORT LAYS BLAME IN GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Correcting quotes in grafs 6 and 16) (htv) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The decision by the International Monetary Fund and
the United States Treasury last year to push Asian nations to send
their interest rates soaring was a crucial blunder that worsened
the world financial crisis, the World Bank concluded Wednesday in a
report of how the trouble started.
</P>
<P>
   The 200-page document deliberately omitted any direct reference
to the IMF or to the Treasury, which has a major voice in the IMF's
decisions. The omission, bank officials said, was a conciliatory
gesture to both institutions, which have often disagreed with the
bank on strategies to fix the crisis that began 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank's blow-by-blow account of a series of cascading
misjudgments places much of the blame on global investors who lent
money with abandon to developing nations, and on Asian officials
who were eager to accumulate the cash. But it left little doubt
that in the bank's judgment the IMF and the Clinton administration
shared responsibility for mishandling the initial response to the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The report also predicts that most of the afflicted nations will
probably begin climbing out of recession next year, with growth
continuing in 2000. But it warns that ``there is still a
substantial risk that the world economy will plunge into recession
in 1999,'' particularly if Japan is unable to end its recession.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank report reflects a broader debate among economists
and policymakers about whether decisions by the IMF and the U.S.
Treasury deepened the crisis, and whether the movement in recent
years to liberalize financial markets around the world should be
dramatically slowed. It argues that some system should be developed
to limit the rush of short-term investments into developing
countries that do not yet have the regulatory systems in place to
monitor how the foreign cash is spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heart of this current crisis,'' Joseph Stiglitz, the chief
economist of the Bank, said Wednesday, ``is the surge of capital
flows. The surge is followed by a precipitous flow out. Few
countries, no matter how strong their financial institutions, could
have withstood such a turnaround, but clearly, the fact that the
financial institutions were weak and their firms highly leveraged
made these countries particularly vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the IMF nor the Treasury, both of which saw the report
before it was published, issued any public comment on it Wednesday.
There are parts they agree with: IMF and Treasury officials have
often blamed the huge volume of private investment into developing
countries _ and the refusal of investors to heed the risks
associated with putting their money into countries with few
regulatory safeguards _ for creating the conditions that led to the
bust.
</P>
<P>
   But they continue to defend their initial strategy of urging
Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea to raise their interest rates,
a classic economic solution intended to reassure investors and
stabilize national currencies. In Thailand and South Korea, those
rates have now declined to about 7 percent and the currencies have
stabilized, developments that IMF officials say vindicate their
approach.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank's report argues that the strategy backfired,
stabilizing the currencies at the cost of plunging the countries
into deep recessions with substantial unemployment. The report
asserts that the interest rate increases spread the economic pain
far beyond the banks, investment funds and real estate companies
that had gotten the countries into trouble to begin with, sending
thousands of small businesses in to bankruptcy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Some estimates are that levels of bankruptcy in Indonesia now
are 75 percent,'' Stiglitz argued Wednesday, ``and, you know, you
cannot have a country perform with 75 percent of its firms in
bankruptcy.''
</P>
<P>
   The report was published on the day that the board of the IMF
formally began its review of the latest bailout, a $41.5 billion
aid package to Brazil. While the World Bank is a major participant
in that bailout, it warned Wednesday against the risk of what it
termed ``rescue creep'' as aid packages get larger and larger.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``No reasonable amount of public money can stop a justified
speculative attack'' on a country's currency, the report concluded.
``By themselves, larger packages worsen moral hazard problems'' _
the risk that investors will expect governments to bail them out _
``and may lead to excessively tough conditions, defeating the end
objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank and the IMF were both created by the Bretton
Woods agreement in 1944 to bring order to the world economy. The
bank's primary responsibility is tending to the poor with
development programs to help fend off poverty and disease; the IMF
focuses chiefly on economic and monetary policy. Those differing
mandates have often led them to disagreements, and two months ago
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin publicly warned both institutions
that the time had come to put their differences aside. One of the
many proposals floating around Washington to reform the
institutions would merge their governing boards, but that would
require a marriage of two very different cultures.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF continues to insist that it made the best judgments it
could at a time of tremendous chaos last year, when the governments
of Thailand and South Korea were going through elections and seemed
unable to make decisions. And it argues that its program in
Indonesia was undermined by the refusal of the government of
President Suharto to stick to its economic agreements, and then by
the political chaos that resulted in Suharto's resignation and
continues on the streets to this day.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at a seminar early this week a senior IMF official
conceded that the fund made some judgments ``too quickly'' and
mistakenly thought it was seeing a repeat of past currency crises,
particularly the one that struck Mexico in 1995. Several months
ago, Stanley Fischer, the IMF's first deputy managing director,
noted that ``in most cases governments call us in only after they
discover they are in a mess, usually because they didn't do things
they needed to do long ago. If the problems were easy to solve,
they'd do it themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the conclusions in the report are likely to fuel the
debate over what to do next. For example, the Bank calls for a
tremendous slowdown in the movement in recent years to deregulate
financial markets in developing countries, a reversal of the policy
that the IMF advocated as late as April 1997, just three months
before Thailand's troubles touched off the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Financial-sector liberalization,'' the report adds, ``which
can significantly boost the risk of crisis, should proceed with
care _ fully and in step with the capacity to design and enforce
tighter regulation and supervision.'' In the past year the IMF and
the Treasury have begun to take the same line, stressing the need
to build regulatory institutions before opening economies to huge
capital flows.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank, however, praised the IMF's programs in several
countries, including their focus on restructuring corporations and
compelling countries, in return for aid, to overhaul their
bankruptcy systems and inject public funds into weak banking
systems.
</P>
<P>
   It also credited the IMF for loosening the conditions on the
bailout programs to ease the pain on the poor. Still it noted that
17 million more people in Indonesia are expected to fall below the
poverty line this year, as wages collapse.

ORDERING CLINTON AND DOLE TO REPAY MILLIONS UNLIKELY, EXPERTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating; this story was budgeted earlier as CAMPAIGN-FINANCE)  (nk) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Election Commission is widely expected
to reject its staff auditors' recommendation that the 1996
campaigns of President Clinton and former Sen. Bob Dole repay the
government millions of dollars because of violations of campaign
finance rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a virtual certainty that these things won't be adopted,''
said David Mason, a Republican in his first year as a commissioner.
Mason said in an interview Wednesday that when the six-member
commission meets Thursday he would offer motions that would have
the effect of blocking most, if not all, of the repayment
requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Cooper, a former senior staff member of the commission and
now a consultant on campaign finance matters, agreed with Mason's
assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they go along with the staff recommendation, that would be
a shocker,'' Cooper said. ``I think they'll block it on a 6-0
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   The main reason for the confident predictions that the
commission will overrule its auditors is that the six members _ by
law, three Republicans and three Democrats _ are generally beholden
to their parties, and both parties are vigorously opposing the
stiff penalties that were recommended.
</P>
<P>
   The auditors' report, released on Tuesday, found that the
Clinton and Dole presidential campaigns illegally benefited from
issue advertising paid for by their political parties. The staff
recommended that the Clinton campaign committee be forced to repay
the government $7 million and the Dole campaign $17.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   The assessments would partly offset the $13 million each
candidate received in federal matching money in the primary season
in 1996 and the more than $60 million each received for the general
election campaign. In return for the federal money, the candidates
agreed to limit their spending of private funds.
</P>
<P>
   The commission may vote on the audit on Thursday, or a vote may
be put off until next week, officials said. It would take a
majority of four of the commissioners to adopt the report.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Attorney General Janet Reno subpoenaed an early
draft of the audit, and it became the basis for a preliminary
inquiry into whether she should ask for an independent counsel to
investigate accusations of unlawful spending by Clinton and the
Democratic Party. She is expected to announce her decision by Dec.
7.
</P>
<P>
   The word among law enforcement officials has been that she is
likely to find insufficient grounds to warrant an outside counsel.
No one knows whether the final audit or its rejection by the
commission will affect her decision.
</P>
<P>
   But Reno was put in an awkward position by the finding that the
Dole campaign had committed some of the same violations that
Republican lawmakers have accused Clinton of. Under the independent
counsel law, she is required to ask for an outside prosecutor if
she finds clear evidence of criminal wrongdoing by the president.
But she cannot seek an independent counsel to investigate Dole and
the Republicans because they are not among those covered by the
law.
</P>
<P>
   If the auditors' recommendations are rejected, it will
illustrate two important points: The campaign law is so riddled
with loopholes that almost any restraint can be breached, and the
FEC is basically toothless.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the millions of dollars the parties spent on issue
advertisements on behalf of their presidential candidates. The
auditors found that the issue ads, as anyone who saw them on
television recognized, were hardly distinguishable from the
candidates' own commercials, spending on which was carefully
limited by law.
</P>
<P>
   Mason, who was an assistant to Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., and a
scholar at the Heritage Foundation before he was appointed to the
FEC, has spoken and written in opposition to limits on ``soft
money,'' the unregulated money used by political parties.
</P>
<P>
   But in this case, he said, that view is irrelevant. He holds
that there is no basis in the law for requiring repayments of
matching funds that candidates received during the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   And those who predict that the FEC will overrule their auditors'
recommendations point out that the terms of two commissioners _ Lee
Ann Elliott, a Republican, and Danny McDonald, a Democrat _ expire
in April, and presumably they want their parties to reappoint them.
Three others _ Mason; Darryl Wold, also a Republican, and Karl
Sandstrom, a Democrat _ were recently appointed to the commission,
presumably because of their loyalty to their parties. The sixth
member is the acting chairman, Scott Thomas, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can bet that they've been getting a lot of calls on
this,'' said Cooper, the former FEC staff member.

CAN YOU SAY GRINCH IN SPANISH? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They left from Parker, Ariz., in three vans on a trip to buy
Christmas presents for the kids in the Colorado River Indian Tribes
Head Start program.
</P>
<P>
   It was the day after Thanksgiving and the Wal-Mart in Calexico,
on the California-Mexico border, was having a big sale.
</P>
<P>
   Their plan was to buy the Christmas presents, then cross into
Mexicali to pick up some fabric and costumes for children in a Head
Start dance group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all went pretty much the way we figured,'' said Head Start
volunteer Lola Westfall. ``At least until we crossed the border,''
when their Christmas fairy tale turned into a horror story.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true,'' said Caroline Constabile, the Head Start
program's director. ``Our volunteers ran into the Grinch down
there. A whole bunch of them.''
</P>
<P>
   They appeared in the form of Mexican border guards, and before
the day was out, the Head Start toys had been confiscated and the
volunteers were stuck with a very un-Seuss-like fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a painful thing to go through,'' Lola said.
</P>
<P>
   She had never been to Mexico before. She volunteers at Head
Start almost every day, and has been a foster parent for nearly 20
years. In that time, she's cared for 18 children, most of them on a
long-term basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most wonderful life you could imagine,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The group traveled caravan-style. Lola was third in line. After
several hours in the Wal-Mart, they'd piled her van high with
everything from dolls and action figures to bicycles. The other two
vehicles were driven by women with relatives in Mexico. They'd
crossed the border dozens of times over the years. Lola followed
them, hauling $700 worth of toys.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us had any idea we were breaking the law,'' Lola said.
</P>
<P>
   But, they were.
</P>
<P>
   In border towns, Mexican law sets a limit of $50 per person, per
day on merchandise you can take into the country. Anything above
that carries a stiff tax.
</P>
<P>
   The van Lola was driving was picked by guards for a random
inspection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't see any signs or anything like that,'' Lola said.
``The guards pulled me over and said, `You're breaking the law.' I
said, `I'm sorry. I didn't know. I'll just go back across.' But
they said no.''
</P>
<P>
   Lola's group had used a traffic lane reserved for those claiming
to have nothing of value to declare. As far as Mexican border
agents were concerned, the Head Start ladies were smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These men knew our people weren't trying to do anything
illegal,'' said Constabile, the Head Start program director. ``They
could have been understanding. They could have let them go.''
</P>
<P>
   They didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the Mexican officers I didn't want to leave that
vehicle,'' Lola said. ``So, I went from office to office while they
did `paperwork.' I ended up there about 13 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Lola was told the van would be returned to her if
she paid a $650 fine. She and her friends maxed out their ATM cards
and got the vehicle back.
</P>
<P>
   Empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last person we talked to was a lawyer,'' Lola said. `'He
told us the law said the goods would be confiscated. So, they kept
our toys.''
</P>
<P>
   Constabile told me she's spoken with representatives of the
American consulate, the Mexican consulate, the Border Patrol and
even members of Mexican-American chambers of commerce. With no
luck.
</P>
<P>
   Francie Noyes, press secretary for Gov. Jane Hull, said, ``We
are a border state, and people are comfortable going back and
forth. But you are crossing the border into a foreign country and
their rules are very different.''
</P>
<P>
   An assistant to the Mexican Consul-General in Phoenix told me
essentially the same thing. She said the $650 fine most likely was
sent to ``fiscal officials'' in Mexico. She did say she'd look into
trying to get the toys back, but she wasn't overly optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers at Head Start had collected the money for the toys
during a Halloween carnival. No tax dollars were involved. The
federally-subsidized program serves 183 low-income children around
Parker, both tribal members and others. They'd planned a Christmas
party for Dec. 16, the day before the children's classes end for
the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Santa was supposed to come and give out the presents,'' said
Constabile, whose organization is scrambling to try to replace a
little of what they lost. ``It breaks my heart that something like
this has happened. I guess some border guards down there will be
having a nice Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday I called the library to ask if there was a Spanish
translation for Grinch. A researcher there told me what the women
from Head Start had learned that day in Mexicali.
</P>
<P>
   A Grinch is a Grinch in any language.

   ``None of us had any idea we were breaking the law,'' Lola said.
</P>
<P>
   But, they were.
</P>
<P>
   In border towns, Mexican law sets a limit of $50 per person, per
day on merchandise you can take into the country. Anything above
that carries a stiff tax.
</P>
<P>
   The van Lola was driving was picked by guards for a random
inspection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't see any signs or anything like that,'' Lola said.
``The guards pulled me over and said, `You're breaking the law.' I
said, `I'm sorry. I didn't know. I'll just go back across.' But
they said no.''
</P>
<P>
   Lola's group had used a traffic lane reserved for those claiming
to have nothing of value to declare. As far as Mexican border
agents were concerned, the Head Start ladies were smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These men knew our people weren't trying to do anything
illegal,'' said Constabile, the Head Start program director. ``They
could have been understanding. They could have let them go.''
</P>
<P>
   They didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the Mexican officers I didn't want to leave that
vehicle,'' Lola said. ``So, I went from office to office while they
did `paperwork.' I ended up there about 13 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Lola was told the van would be returned to her if
she paid a $650 fine. She and her friends maxed out their ATM cards
and got the vehicle back.
</P>
<P>
   Empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last person we talked to was a lawyer,'' Lola said. `'He
told us the law said the goods would be confiscated. So, they kept
our toys.''
</P>
<P>
   Constabile told me she's spoken with representatives of the
American consulate, the Mexican consulate, the Border Patrol and
even members of Mexican-American chambers of commerce. With no
luck.
</P>
<P>
   Francie Noyes, press secretary for Gov. Jane Hull, said, ``We
are a border state, and people are comfortable going back and
forth. But you are crossing the border into a foreign country and
their rules are very different.''
</P>
<P>
   An assistant to the Mexican Consul-General in Phoenix told me
essentially the same thing. She said the $650 fine most likely was
sent to ``fiscal officials'' in Mexico. She did say she'd look into
trying to get the toys back, but she wasn't overly optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers at Head Start had collected the money for the toys
during a Halloween carnival. No tax dollars were involved. The
federally-subsidized program serves 183 low-income children around
Parker, both tribal members and others. They'd planned a Christmas
party for Dec. 16, the day before the children's classes end for
the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Santa was supposed to come and give out the presents,'' said
Constabile, whose organization is scrambling to try to replace a
little of what they lost. ``It breaks my heart that something like
this has happened. I guess some border guards down there will be
having a nice Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday I called the library to ask if there was a Spanish
translation for Grinch. A researcher there told me what the women
from Head Start had learned that day in Mexicali.
</P>
<P>
   A Grinch is a Grinch in any language.

   TWO FRENCH DRUG MAKERS IN $10.4 BILLION MERGER
</P>
<P>
   Two French drug makers, Sanofi and Synthelabo, agreed to merge
for $10.4 billion, the second alliance between two European
pharmaceutical companies announced this week.
</P>
<P>
   The new company, Sanofi-Synthelabo, will have $6.3 billion in
annual sales _about one-fourth the size of Merck _ but will have
considerable product strength in the industry. While analysts
largely dismissed the partial merger between Rhone-Poulenc and
Hoechst on Tuesday, the union of Sanofi and Synthelabo won
considerable praise.

company's failure to make a profit. The British automaker also
disclosed proposals for job cuts, flexible working hours,
government aid and new investment intended to propel the company
into profitability.

   BOEING, SEARS LEAD STOCKS LOWER
</P>
<P>
   Stocks weakened after Boeing and Sears, Roebuck warned of lower
1999 profits, but the main gauges rebounded during the afternoon
and finished with losses of less than 1 percent. The Dow Jones
industrial average fell 69 points, to 9,064.54. The S&AMP;P 500 fell
4.03 points, to 1,171.25, and Nasdaq fell 8.54 points, to 1,995.21.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Sears, Roebuck fell as much as 7 percent after the
nation's largest department store retailer said weak apparel sales
hurt revenue in November and could result in lower-than-expected
earnings for the year. Several Wall Street analysts cautioned that
the slump in clothing sales could hurt other major department store
retailers as well.
</P>

VENTURA PICKS METS BECAUSE OF THE TEAM'S CHANCES 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Mets put one further touch on their off-season
shopping spree Wednesday when they agreed on a four-year deal worth
$32 million for the five-time Gold Glove third baseman Robin
Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura's free-agent signing, which had been expected, was the
third signing for at least $8 million that the Mets have made since
they missed qualifying for the playoffs on the season's final day.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this fall, general manager Steve Phillips signed Mike
Piazza to a 7-year, $91 million deal and Al Leiter for 4 years at
$32 million. Both Piazza and Leiter, as well as Dennis Cook (who
re-signed with the Mets for 3 years and $6.6 million), were
apparently instrumental in Ventura's decision to sign with the Mets
instead of the Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura said that both Piazza and Leiter had phoned him in the
last two weeks, while he had called Cook on his own. ``They did
maybe a little bit of recruiting,'' said Ventura, a lifetime .274
hitter in nine-plus seasons with the Chicago White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   The money, of course, had something to do with the signing, too.
Ventura had been seeking exactly what the Mets gave him. But
Ventura said his decision had more to do with the Mets' chances of
winning. ``Obviously, they gave me a great contract,'' said the
31-year-old Ventura, who needed a strong final month to hit .263
last season with 21 homers and 91 runs batted in. ``And now they
have a vested interest in me. But again, I looked at the potential
for winning as a major consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   And with a revamped offense, the Mets are confident that they
have the chance to do just that. After trading for Bobby Bonilla
and then trading Todd Hundley and obtaining outfielder Roger Cedeno
and the hard-throwing right-handed reliever Armando Benitez in a
three-team deal, the Mets' only remaining need is for a corner
outfielder who can lead off. And that might come soon _ in the form
of Rickey Henderson, who will turn 40 on Christmas Day but led the
major leagues in stolen bases last season with 66.
</P>
<P>
   His representatives, who also count Piazza, Bonilla and closer
John Franco as clients, were scheduled to meet with Phillips either
late Wednesday night or Thursday to talk money for the first time
with the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson is believed to be seeking a contract for at the least
one year with an option for a second _ or more preferably, two
guaranteed years _ at around $2 million per season. According to
one of his representatives, Dan Horwits, the Oakland Athletics, for
whom he has been playing; the Seattle Mariners and possibly the
Texas Rangers are also interested in Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, meanwhile, have had a number of discussions with
Henderson's representatives, but were waiting to see if they would
sign Ventura _ and consequently move Edgardo Alfonzo to second base
_ or sign the free agent outfielder B.J. Surhoff and leave Alfonzo
at third before they committed to where they wanted their leadoff
hitter to play.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Phillips insisted his main priority all along had
been to sign the left-handed- hitting Ventura, who could bat behind
the right-handed hitting Piazza and in front of the switch-hitting
Bonilla in a lineup that figures to have much more pop than last
season's version, although Valentine wasn't quite ready to put
Ventura into his accustomed No. 5 slot just yet.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Valentine was obviously excited about having Ventura,
calling the signing ``the crowning blow to a really nice winter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really more excited about this team and lineup,''
Valentine said. ``Last year, we began the season with our catcher
hitting seventh and our shortstop hitting eighth, with John Olerud
and Edgardo Alfonzo hitting somewhere, and with a lot of question
marks.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Ventura (who won his fifth Gold Glove this season) at
third and Rey Ordonez (who has won two consecutive Gold Gloves) at
short, the Mets easily have the strongest left side of the infield
in baseball. And with Alfonzo shifting back to second and the
always steady Olerud at first, the Mets may have the strongest
defensive infield as well.

JOHN WAYNE'S LAST RANCH IS FOR SALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL SOWERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, John Wayne, America's hero, climbed atop a
rise overlooking the handsome Santa Cruz Valley in Arizona near the
Mexican border and envisioned building a huge compound for his
family there.
</P>
<P>
   The 4,200-foot rise, known as Duke's Hill, is the highest point
of Wayne's 670-acre spread of Sonoran Desert, just six miles from
Nogales, Sonora, one of the actor's favorite haunts.
</P>
<P>
   But Wayne died in 1979 before he could start building on his
100-acre hill. His partner and longtime friend, Ralph Wingfield,
89, said the scenic land was never developed because ``John got
sick and I got too damned old.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the spread, adjacent to the Nogales International Airport,
is for sale for $2.3 million, put on the market in October by the
actor's sons, Michael and Ethan.
</P>
<P>
   When the ranch sells, it will be the last of the Wayne land
legacy in Arizona, which served as the landscape for some of the
actor's he-man movies.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne's ranch near Springerville is now owned by the Hopi Tribe.
Another of his spreads near Casa Grande is in a trust, and once was
the proposed site of a war museum.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Perna, a Scottsdale Realtor specializing in luxury
properties, is handling the latest sale, which has prompted stories
in the ``Wall Street Journal'' and a two-page spread in the
``duPont Registry,'' a national real estate publication featuring
upscale properties.
</P>
<P>
   Development at neighboring Kino Springs golf community _ once a
working ranch belonging to Wayne friends, actors Stewart Granger
and Jean Simmons _ prompted the Wayne brothers to sell the
property, Perna said.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Wayne died, the impetus to build the compound was
lost,'' Perna said.
</P>
<P>
   A prospective buyer from Denver is coming this month, and if
he's amenable, Perna will take him through the property on
horseback, and let him climb up Duke's Hill for a glimpse of the
cottonwoods lining the Santa Cruz River on the southern edge of the
property.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by $5 million working ranches, the Wayne land could
morph into a development of single-family homes, or a resort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see lots of opportunities,'' Perna said.
</P>
<P>
   So did Wayne, said longtime friend Wingfield, a Tubac rancher,
who often talked with the actor about building a home for his
family in the high desert near Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Wingfield supplied the cattle for Wayne's 1948 movie, ``Red
River,'' and later for his 1962 movie, ``McLintock,''filmed near
Nogales.
</P>
<P>
   Wingfield recalled a fishing trip to the Mediterranean with
Wayne, and said the actor frequently stayed at his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We became good friends,'' Wingfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Wayne, a movie producer, told the ``duPont Registry''
that his father was fascinated by southern Arizona and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The actor thought ``it was great down there,'' Michael told the
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, he said his father flew his jet to the Nogales
airport from the family home in Newport Beach, Calif., and talked
about building a hangar on the property so he could taxi to the
compound.
</P>
<P>
   Once in Mexico, Michael said, his father drank a special kind of
tequila, savored the Mexican food, and ``loved the Latin ladies.'' &QL;

THE DEAD STAYED HOME ON ELECTION DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JOSH BARBANEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Republicans seeking to challenge a 21,000-vote lead
that would make Eliot Spitzer, a Democrat, the next state attorney
general of New York, at one point charged that 1,000 votes might
have been cast in Manhattan by dead voters.
</P>
<P>
   While the accusation conjures visions of an all-powerful
Democratic political machine at work _ something not seen in
Manhattan for at least a generation _ an examination of computer
files by The New York Times turned up no pattern of vote fraud, and
found not one phantom vote from beyond the grave.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry found the names of several thousand people who
remained on the voter rolls even after their reputed deaths. But it
counted only a handful of votes cast by voters listed by the Social
Security Administration as having died. And it turned out that all
but one of these voters were alive and living in Manhattan and were
found to have cast legal ballots; in that one instance, a son with
the same name as his father said he had mistakenly signed next to
his father's name in the voting book.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City Board of Elections has often been vilified as
an outdated and mismanaged bureaucracy, and in the fight over the
race for attorney general, Republicans working for the incumbent,
Dennis Vacco, have cited what they said were a number of
irregularities, including the charge about dead voters. They
ultimately pulled back and acknowledged that they could not prove
that dead voters cast ballots, but contended that they found enough
problems to cast a cloud over the election results.
</P>
<P>
   The Times' inquiry found no pattern of problems with dead
voters, but it did find evidence that the city Board of Elections
had made a considerable effort to clean up the rolls and remove the
names of ineligible voters.
</P>
<P>
   The Times compared the rolls of all voters registered in
Manhattan last year with a list provided by the Social Security
Administration of the 17.4 million Americans who have died since
1990. The comparison turned up the names of nearly 8,000 people
registered to vote in Manhattan who had the same first name, last
name and date of birth as dead Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The Times narrowed the list to 4,600 of the deceased who had
lived in the same ZIP code where New Yorkers of the same name
voted. The Times then checked a random sample of more than 900 of
these 4,600 registered voters in nearly 200 election districts to
see whether anyone had signed his or her name in voting books. Only
four voted, fewer than half of 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that the same pattern held for the 4,600, that would
amount to 19 votes. Assuming that the pattern held for all 8,000
votes, it would amount to 38 invalid votes. And even if the same
pattern held across all of New York City, it would amount to only
132 votes _ far short of the 21,000-vote lead that Spitzer has over
Vacco.
</P>
<P>
   In reviewing the four cases, The Times found that three of the
people who voted were reported to be alive by neighbors, relatives
or a doorman or by their own testimony. Their continued existence
was later confirmed by the Social Security Administration as well.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth case appeared to be a vote from beyond, but that vote
also had a logical explanation. While Bethel Harris died in 1992 at
the age of 81, the signature of Bethel Harris was in the voting
book in the polling place in the community room of the Washington
Heights Co-op.
</P>
<P>
   But the culprit turned out to be his son _ who is also named
Bethel Harris. The younger Harris, 44, said he had voted in every
election for the last 26 years, accompanying his mother, Claudia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I vote every time, elections, primaries and whatever, and I
have been voting since I was 18,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The first year after his father died, Harris voted on a paper
ballot. Mrs. Harris said her son discovered that while his own
voting card had been removed from the files, his dead father's card
remained.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, and in general elections and primaries since,
Bethel Harris Jr. showed up at the polls, signed the book under the
name Bethel Harris and voted. He did not notice, Mrs. Harris said,
that the date of birth listed on the voting form showed his
father's birthday in 1917 in small print, rather than his own.
Moreover, his signature is similar to his father's.
</P>
<P>
   Board of Elections officials pieced together a slightly
different account of the younger Harris' voting history, but
confirmed that he was eligible to vote, voted legally, and is now
listed as a voter in his Washington Heights building.
</P>
<P>
   When The Times phoned and knocked on the doors of the other
purportedly dead voters, it found them very much alive.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Romero, a retired hospital security guard who lives on the
Upper West Side, said, ``I'm still alive, and well.'' Romero and
his daughter said that the date of death listed for Romero was
actually the date his wife died.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said that another voter, Antonio Pagan, was alive and
well on Riverside Drive. One neighbor said that Pagan, 65, told her
his Social Security check had stopped coming for a while, until he
convinced the agency that he was alive.
</P>
<P>
   And Board of Elections officials said they had called the fourth
voter, Sally Anderson, and confirmed that she too was alive and
entitled to vote.
</P>
<P>
   When Thomas Spargo, a lawyer for Vacco's campaign, announced
that he had a list of dead Manhattan voters who may have cast
ballots, dozens of Republican campaign workers spent days poring
over signature books in boxes haphazardly scattered across a room
at the Board of Elections' Manhattan headquarters, on Varick
Street.
</P>
<P>
   But after reporters from The Times began reviewing signature
cards at the Board of Elections late last week, Spargo acknowledged
that the attorney general did not have any lists of dead voters,
only lists of people listed as being dead who may have voted.
</P>
<P>
   And Monday, Spargo acknowledged that the number of
irregularities his volunteers had found could not affect the
result, all but conceding Vacco's defeat.
</P>
<P>
   He said then that the Vacco campaign had found ``a significant
number of irregularities.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added that ``in certain cases, because of a lack of a
date of birth in the Board of Elections records and people being in
the same household with the same name, we didn't always have the
most accurate information.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about The Times' findings, Assemblyman Herman Farrell, the
Manhattan Democratic Party chairman, said they showed that the
Republican charges were completely unfounded and demonstrated that
the kind of major voter fraud alleged by the Republicans made no
sense today, in an age without either powerful or efficient
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not about being powerful enough; it is about being
efficient enough,'' he said. ``If I were efficient enough to
organize dead voters, I would be far more effective at getting live
voters to the polls.''

   An analysis by Aristotle Industries, which resells lists of
registered voters to candidates, indicates that the voter rolls of
New York City and state are cleaner than average.

the increase is below the 16 percent inflation rate, labor's

   NEW YORK _ As the season continues to slip away, National
Basketball Association players and owners will meet Thursday in
Manhattan for the first time in 13 days to try to end the
five-month-old lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're beyond the part of being frustrated,'' said
Michael Curry, a member of the union's negotiating committee.
</P>
<P>
   Having set an unofficial mid-December deadline for striking a
deal and having tested the union's resolve for the past month _ a
period in which more than 200 players did not receive two paychecks
_ the owners may have a renewed urgency in talking.
</P>
<P>
   The union is feeling the pressure, too. The union's executive
director, Billy Hunter, has had his work questioned by Isiah
Thomas, a former union leader. Phil Jackson said Wednesday he had
reservations about the players' leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very concerned about the representation on the players
side,'' Jackson said from his home in Chicago. ``I've talked to
some players who are not your $10 million and $20 million players _
that do not feel like they have enough power to speak out because
they don't have the clout.''

gets under way next month in Palm Desert.
</P>
<P>
   The five-round competition, which runs Jan. 20-24, will be
played this year at Bermuda Dunes Country Club, Indian Wells CC,
Tamarisk CC and the Arnold Palmer Private Course at PGA West. The
Palmer course hosts the final round.
</P>
<P>
   Couples, the PGA Player of the Year in 1991 and '92, has had to
deal with the loss of both parents to cancer in recent years but
rebounded this year to set a personal record for earnings with
$1,650,389.
</P>
<P>
   He edged Bruce Lietzke in a playoff for the Hope title in
January, won the Memorial in May and led the Masters until the
final holes before finishing second to eventual Player of the Year
Mark O'Meara.
</P>
<P>
   As usual in the popular Hope format, pros will be paired with
celebrities for the first four rounds.
</P>
<P>
   The PGA Tour arrives in Los Angeles the following month, when
Riviera Country Club resumes its role as host of the Feb. 15-21
Nissan Open _ hosted by Valencia Country Club last year when
Riviera hosted the U.S. Senior Open.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Mayfair, who defeated Tiger Woods in a playoff to win at
Valencia, will return to defend his title in the Nissan, which has
boosted its purse to $2.8 million _ $504,000 for first place.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament, managed by the Los Angeles Junior Chamber of
Commerce for a 73rd year, is the oldest civic-sponsored event on
the PGA Tour. Nissan has been affiliated since 1986 and been title
sponsor since '89.

WITNESSING WINTERING EAGLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VENTURA, Calif. _ Combine the recent word that the bald eagle
will soon be removed from the endangered species list with the
success of its migrations southward. What you get is a recipe
Southern California birdwatchers find irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   There might be as many as 50 of the birds in the Southland. Now
is the time when the nation's symbol is most visible and amenable
to visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wintertime is the time to see eagles. And there are enough
of them wintering in the south that people don't have to migrate
north, so to speak, to see them,'' said Robert Mesta, a biologist
with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Ventura.
``Traditionally, if you are an eagle lover or a birdwatcher or just
a nature fanatic and wanted to see large concentrations of bald
eagles, you would have to travel up to the Klamath Basin in
Southern Oregon and Northern California.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other birds, bald eagles fly south for the winter. Here
they socialize in communal roosts high above area reservoirs that
offer stable habitats _ fixed water regimes, regular trout plants
for anglers, ripe with meal-size waterfowl and managed with a
manicure's touch.
</P>
<P>
   Healthy populations are found at Big Bear, Baldwin, Arrowhead
and Silverwood lakes in the San Bernardino Mountains, at lakes
Skinner and Mathews in Riverside County and at Santa Barbara
County's Lake Cachuma. Four pairs make permanent homes on Santa
Catalina Island since a program to introduce the birds to the isle
began in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Their fondness for Southern California comes as a surprise to
many people, especially ``eagle virgins,'' as the uninitiated are
so dubbed by Robin Butler, a staff biologist with the San
Bernardino National Forest's Mountaintop District. Butler, who is
in her ninth year of overseeing the winter eagle surveys around Big
Bear Lake, helps coordinate the lake's ``eagle discovery tours.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been with many people when they saw their first eagle,''
Butler said. ``People tear up and cry and hoop and holler. You get
all sorts of different reactions, like, `They are so big!' For
Americans, we experience two things: First, seeing this really
cool-looking bird, and, second, there is sort of a patriotic
feeling to it. Every time I see an eagle, my heart beats a little
faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Whereas nesting birds vehemently defend their territory, are
solitary and keep a low profile in spring, wintering populations
are social creatures from November to March and don't mind human
onlookers. They are most active in the morning and late afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Big Bear Lake artist Mark Bathen encountered his first eagle
last winter outside his studio in Boulder Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like an omen,'' Bathen said. ``I was shoveling snow and
thinking I really wanted to paint something to represent Big Bear
and it was up in a tree looking at me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love birds, but when it comes to eagles, they are at the top
of the chain as far as intelligence; it was in his eyes. Their
beauty, their loyalty to each other, their courage, their strength,
they have all the qualities that we would like to possess.''
</P>
<P>
   Bathen's encounter with the eagle resulted in a seven-part
series dedicated to the bird and a large mural on Big Bear
Boulevard depicting the raptor.
</P>
<P>
   People don't often forget such experiences. Recently while I was
aboard the Southern California Marine Institute's research vessel
Yellowfin off Catalina's West End, skipper Jimmy Cvitanovich of
Seal Beach pointed out a bald eagle perched atop a rocky ridge, not
far from its pyramid-shaped nest. I watched it for several minutes
through binoculars and was mesmerized by its grace and composure.
It's easy to see why the bird was chosen as our national icon.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are just impressive birds,'' said Cvitanovich, who once
enticed an East End eagle to swoop down within a few feet of the
vessel to retrieve a dead mackerel that had be tossed overboard.
``It's just like watching somebody do a great ski jump or
something. It was fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The natural range of the bald eagle extends from Alaska across
Canada and the Lower 48 to Northern Mexico. Records indicate birds
nested up and down the coast, feasting on saltwater fish, carrion
and steelhead and salmon that spawned in freshwater streams. Mesta
said with development, the loss of steelhead runs and the World War
II-era introduction of the toxic insecticide DDT, Southern
California lost its eagles by the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The bird was placed on the endangered species list in the
contiguous United States in the late 1960s. Thanks largely to the
outlawing of DDT in the early 1970s, Mesta said, populations have
rebounded. In 1978, there were 1,000 nesting pairs of bald eagles
in the Lower 48; today there 5,290 pairs. An eagle nest was
discovered at Lake Cachuma in 1986 and other birds followed suit,
repopulating the Southland by finding favorable habitat at other
reservoirs. By 1995, the bald eagle was ``downlisted'' to
threatened status.
</P>
<P>
   Mesta believes the species will be removed from the list
altogether by early 2000, though some scientists believe the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service is moving too quickly with its eagle
agenda. ``I think it's ready to go off the list . . . and that it
will do just fine,'' Mesta said. &QL; 
IF YOU'RE GOING
</P>
<P>
   WHERE EAGLES SOAR
</P>
<P>
   Those who wish to take guided bald-eagle tours or count birds
for research have several regional options. Wintertime programs can
be found at Silverwood and Big Bear lakes in the San Bernardino
Mountains and Santa Barbara County's Cachuma Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Three-hour van tours are offered weekends and holidays from Dec.
12 to March 14 at the new Big Bear Discovery Center, 40396 North
Shore Drive, 4 miles east of Fawnskin on Highway 38. They run at 9
a.m. and 1 p.m. Saturdays and at 10 a.m. Sundays and holidays (Dec.
28-31, Jan. 18 and Feb. 15). Prices are $25 for adults, $20 for
ages 3 to 16 and free for children 2 and younger. Snacks,
binoculars and spotting scopes are provided.
</P>
<P>
   Also at Big Bear Lake, volunteers are being sought to conduct
eagle counts from 9 to 10 a.m. on Dec. 19, Jan. 9, Feb. 13 and
March 13. Participants must be at the Discovery Center no later
than 8:30 a.m. on survey day to receive instructions, data sheets
and maps. Bring binoculars and warm clothes. Call the center at
(909) 866-3437 for information on tours and bird counts.
</P>
<P>
   Hour-long boat tours are conducted at 9 and 11 a.m. Saturdays
and Sundays from Jan. 9 to March 7 at the Silverwood Lake State
Recreation Area, along Highway 138. The program is free with the
$6-per-car park admission. Eagle surveying is done in conjunction
with the Big Bear Lake bird counts; volunteers are needed.
Information: (760) 389-2303.
</P>
<P>
   Up at Cachuma Lake on Highway 154, two-hour eagles cruises
depart at 10 a.m. Wednesday through Sunday. A second tour on
Fridays and Saturdays leaves at 2 p.m. Prices are $12 for adults
and $5 for ages 12 and younger; binoculars are provided.
Information: (805) 686-5050 or (805) 688-4658. Eagle counts are
also conducted and the Cachuma Lake Nature Center has a display
dedicated to the raptors; call (805) 688-4515 for details.
</P>
<P>
   Reservations are recommended for all tours. Those who prefer to
track eagles on their own can call any of the above sites for
information on where they are roosting.
</P>
<P>
   While not specifically geared to eagles, wildlife tours on Santa
Catalina Island come across the birds on occasion. Information:
Santa Catalina Island Conservancy, (310) 510-1421, Catalina
Adventure Tours, (310) 510-2888, and Discovery Tours, (800)
428-2566.

GOOD-BYE, GARDENS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Ray Ferraro grew up nearly a continent away from here,
but as a young boy he often dreamed of an old shrine on Carlton
Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maple Leaf Gardens is one of the rinks growing up as a kid
that you always dreamed you would play in,'' said the Kings'
Ferraro, a native of British Columbia. ``I've had a lot of good
memories in there and watched a lot of hockey from there when I was
a kid. I'm glad we get one last chance to go there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings game with the Maple Leafs on Wednesday was their last
in the Gardens, which opened in 1931. On Feb. 13, the Leafs will
play their final game there, against the Chicago Blackhawks. One
week later, they'll christen the new Air Canada Centre against the
Montreal Canadiens.
</P>
<P>
   The Leafs will leave behind a treasure-trove of hockey history
and memories, the home to 11 of their 13 Stanley Cup championship
teams, the last in 1967. It is the last of the old hockey palaces,
which have been replaced in recent years by dollar-driven new
edifices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The magic of any arena is the sense of intimacy it provides,''
Toronto general manager Ken Dryden said. ``If you can't generate a
sense of intimacy, it doesn't feel right. That sense of closeness
with the guy next to you and with 16,000 or 18,000 other people is
why you go into an arena and don't sit at home in the family room
and watch the game on television. That's our challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   With the knowledge that the Gardens' days are numbered _ 13
games remain _ it has been a time for nostalgia, though not
everyone has felt sentimental.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans see the glory and greatness in the building, but they
put us in a hellhole, down in this dungeon,'' Edmonton assistant
coach Ted Green said of the Gardens' cramped visiting dressing
room. ``It still has the first coat of paint (former owner) Harold
Ballard put on it, and the rug's the same one (long-dead Leafs
icon) King Clancy walked on as a kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sorry most of the old buildings are gone. I do miss
the Montreal Forum. That was a great place. But Boston, Chicago,
this place in Toronto . . . rats, cockroaches. The pictures and
memories are easily transportable.''
</P>
<P>
   The man who scored the first goal in Gardens history 67 years
ago _ a Chicago Blackhawk _ is alive, even though the NHL's
Official Guide and Record Book says otherwise. And 90-year-old
Harold ``Mush'' March has the first puck to light the lamp at the
Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The puck is right where I can see it,'' March recently told
the Chicago Sun-Times. ``My picture is on it. It was just one of
those things when you're there at the right time for something
special. I've been to a lot of affairs where they ask me about the
goal. No one's offered me money for the puck, but I'd never sell it
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   If Kings goalie Jamie Storr had the puck, he probably wouldn't
sell it, either. Storr, though 68 years younger than March,
appreciates the history of the Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Storr grew up in the Toronto area and remembers listening to his
grandmother's stories of attending games at the Gardens half a
century ago. Last season, Storr played in the Gardens for the first
time, recording a 3-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's a dream and it's a dream that came true last
year,'' Storr said. ``You never look back upon a game at Maple Leaf
Gardens as anything but a special moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The building also holds a special memory for the Kings. Five
years ago, Maple Leaf Gardens was the scene of the most significant
victory in Los Angeles hockey history _ a seventh-game playoff
triumph that advanced the Kings to their first and so far only
Stanley Cup finals.

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ With no debate or notice, the state Senate
suddenly and overwhelmingly approved legislation Wednesday night
that would help New York City's politically influential police
union win higher raises, reopening a contentious battle that
previously inflamed relations among the union, state officials and
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Already approved by the Assembly, the bill now goes to Gov.
George Pataki, who faces the same predicament that he confronted
when he received the last version in early 1996: veto the
legislation and antagonize the union, the Patrolmen's Benevolent
Association, or sign it and incur the wrath of Giuliani. Pataki
vetoed the earlier measure, though he has not said what he will do
with this one. But Senate aides said they believed that the
leadership of the Republican-controlled Senate would not have
approved the legislation if it thought the governor would veto it.
</P>
<P>
   The passage of the bill drew an immediate attack from the mayor,
who maintained that it would seriously damage the city's finances.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which would give the union the right to ask that a
state panel rather than a city one arbitrate impasses on wages,
appeared dead when the Senate declined to approve it at the end of
the legislative session in June. But Wednesday night, with
attention during a special two-day session focused on backroom
haggling over a salary increase for elected state officials, the
Senate leadership quietly slipped in the bill, and it passed, 58-1.
</P>
<P>
   Such furtive steps on controversial bills are a time-honored
custom in Albany, where legislative leaders often use the hectic
end of a session to shroud some work.
</P>
<P>
   The passage of the police union bill came as the Senate narrowly
approved the salary measure, which would give 38 percent raises to
most state elected officials and increase base salaries for
legislators to $79,500 from $57,500 a year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In an indication of the anxiety the bill stirs among members,
the vote was split largely along geographic, not partisan, lines.
It won approval from members from New York City and its suburbs,
where the cost of living is high and some local officials make more
than state legislators. Members from upstate, where the public is
generally considered to be more fiscally conservative, mostly
opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   The final vote in the Senate was 32-27. The
Democratic-controlled Assembly had approved the legislation
Tuesday, 86 to 55.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki responded to the salary bill Wednesday with silence,
withholding his support while he negotiates with legislative
leaders on other proposals that he wants. Because of the way salary
increases are handled in the state constitution, the bill is
required to become law before Jan. 1 if the Legislature is to
receive an increase next year. So Pataki is using the calendar as
leverage over legislative leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate also passed several other measures that have been
linked in negotiations to the salary bill, The measures would allow
the creation of so-called charter public schools in the state,
which would be independent from local school bureaucracies; end
tenure for public school principals, which would largely affect New
York City, and stiffen penalties for school violence.
</P>
<P>
   Another Senate bill would prohibit legislators from receiving
any increase in salary if the new state budget is not approved by
the April 1 deadline. One of the last bills approved was a
resolution that would increase the governor's salary to $179,000
from $130,000. But in a bit of gamesmanship, the Legislature added
a clause that would cancel the measure if lawmakers' salaries do
not increase next year.
</P>
<P>
   While Pataki backs these educational measures in general, the
Democratic leadership in the Assembly does not. So Pataki is hoping
that he can trade support for a salary increase, which is
particularly popular among Assembly Democrats from New York City,
in return for the Assembly's approval of some variation of the
Senate proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Both houses could return later this month for another special
session if leaders progress in negotiations on the bills tied to
the pay raise.
</P>
<P>
   Upon learning that the Senate had passed the police arbitration
bill, Giuliani derided the Legislature as a prisoner of powerful
interest groups like the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association.
Giuliani said that if the bill becomes law, it could cost the city
$1 billion after the next contract is negotiated early in the next
decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inability of the New York state politicians to stand up to
the special-interest pressure of the PBA is one of the reasons why
people disrespect politicians today,'' Giuliani said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani noted that the bill would not affect him, because by
the time the talks for the next contract take place, he will have
left office under the city's term-limits law. But he said he was
fighting the bill because it would permanently harm the city's
budget.
</P>
<P>
   John McArdle, a spokesman for the Senate leadership, said the
Senate approved the legislation to insure that police officers
around the state were treated equally. ``This bill affords the New
York police officers the same rights that other police officers
have in being able to settle contract disputes,'' McArdle said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the police union could not be reached for
comment Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Zenia Mucha, Pataki's communications director, did not respond
to messages seeking comment on the police and salary bills.
</P>
<P>
   The police union has long been one of the most forceful interest
groups in Albany, repeatedly lobbying for bills that intrude on
city officials' authority over the police department and generously
handing out campaign contributions. In the last two years, it
contributed $160,000 to state candidates and committees, most of
them in the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   After Pataki vetoed the earlier version of this legislation in
1996, the Legislature took the extremely rare step of overriding
him. Giuliani then succeeded in getting the law overturned in
court, arguing that it illegally seized authority from the New York
City government without its permission.
</P>
<P>
   The new bill tries to address that issue by moving all wage
arbitration for any police officers in the state to the state
board, not just that for New York City. But Giuliani vowed that if
Pataki signed the measure, he would go to court again.

 &HT;    Ex-Huffy employers, community excited by talk of plant buy
 &HT;    By Scott Elliott
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ While Huffy Corp. officials said the sale of its
closed Celina plant is not imminent, talk Wednesday of a possible
buyer generated optimism. Mercer County residents hope new jobs
could be on the way for 1,000 former Huffy workers.
</P>
<P>
   Since the plant closed in July, Mercer County's unemployment
rate tripled to almost 10 percent, Ohio's worst.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Huffy confirmed four suitors have expressed serious
interest in buying the Celina plant. Even so, officials cautioned
that a deal is not near.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not that close,'' said Paul Fisher, Huffy's assistant
treasurer. ``A number of interested parties have toured the
facility. We're going to be getting proposals from the parties.''
</P>
<P>
   The vacant 850,000-square-foot plant has an advertised asking
price of $8 million, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher would not identify the interested companies, but Crown
Equipment Corp., a New Bremen lift truck manufacturer, told
employees this week it had inquired about the Celina plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking with Huffy,'' said Rod Hinders, associate
general counsel for Crown. ``We put a bulletin out to our employees
to quell rumors.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Stelzer, community development director for Mercer County,
said Huffy might have announced a deal this week with a
Philadelphia investment company that planned to rent portions of
the plant to several industrial users, but backed off when Crown
expressed interest.
</P>
<P>
   Stelzer would not name the investment company.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would have been a good deal, too,'' Stelzer said of the
Philadelphia group's offer. ``Everybody, Huffy included, is
interested in what is the best fit for the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Hinders said he did not know how Crown might use the Huffy plant
if it was purchased. Crown operates plants in Dayton, New
Knoxville, Greencastle, Ind., and Kinston, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Heidi Arnold, community development director for the city of
Celina, said a manufacturer would be ideal for the Huffy plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best case scenario would be to sell that facility to a
large industrial user,'' Arnold said. ``The use of the facility is
paramount.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials are cautiously optimistic that sale of the plant
could mean a significant job opportunities for former Huffy
workers, Arnold said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that makes us attractive is our available
workforce,'' she said. ``Skilled labor is hard to come by. With
Crown, we're hoping their intention is to create a new division or
make a new line here.''

ALBERT FREY, 95, MODERNIST AND MINIMALIST ARCHITECT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (bl) 
 By JULIE V. IOVINE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Albert Frey, an early ambassador to America of the International
Style of architecture who later brought its themes to buildings in
harmony with the American desert, died at his home in Palm Springs,
Calif., on Nov. 14, said his executor, F. Gillar Boyd Jr. He was
95.
</P>
<P>
   Frey belonged to a generation that believed in a political role
for modern architecture, that of social liberation through
machine-made, egalitarian and affordable designs. His chosen
materials were aluminum, glass, cables and, eventually, the very
boulders and sands of the desert where he settled.
</P>
<P>
   In a career that spanned more than 65 years, Frey remained true
to the principle that architecture should make the most of the
least. His best known works were the East Coast houses he designed
with Lawrence Kocher in the 1930s and the many buildings he created
in the Palm Springs of the 1940s, '50s and '60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the last of a generation of European architects that
came to the West Coast envisioning that, in this unformed
landscape, a perfected vision of a modern future could bloom,''
said Terence Riley, chief curator of architecture and design at the
Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Frey was born in Zurich on Oct. 18, 1903. He studied
architecture at the Institute of Technology in Winterthur,
Switzerland, and received his degree in 1924. In 1929 he spent
about 10 months working in the Paris atelier of Le Corbusier, where
he worked on the detailing of one of Le Corbusier's masterworks,
the Villa Savoye.
</P>
<P>
   In 1930, Frey came to the United States, convinced that it was
the land of opportunity for modernist design. While in New York, he
met Marion E. Cook, a writer, and they were married from 1938 to
1944.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, he worked for several prominent architects,
including Philip Goodwin, one of the architects of the Museum of
Modern Art. Frey is credited by his biographer with contributing to
the design of the original Roy and Niuta Titus Theater as well as
of the museum's roof deck, with its distinctive circular cut-outs.
Both are to be restored by Yoshio Taniguchi, the architect of the
museum's latest expansion plans.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the 1931 Aluminaire house that drew critical and
popular attention to Frey and his collaborator Kocher, then the
managing editor of Architectural Record. Commissioned by the
Architectural League as a way to promote modernist housing ideas,
the Aluminaire House was one of only two American houses
represented in Philip Johnson and Henry-Russell Hitchcock's
landmark 1932 museum show, ``International Exhibition: Modern
Architecture.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, with modernism in disfavor, the aluminum and glass
house was about to be destroyed when the New York Institute of
Technology rescued it and moved it to the West Islip, N.J., campus
of the New York institute, where it was dismantled. It is now under
reconstruction at the school.
</P>
<P>
   In 1939, Frey moved to Palm Springs. He became part of the
movement championed by other California modernists including John
Lautner to emphasize the central place of nature in modern
architecture.
</P>
<P>
   For Frey, the desert was his true love. ``When I saw the
landscape of the desert, I knew I found a place I could call
home,'' he said to Joseph Rosa, author of a 1990 biography of Frey.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous buildings by Frey helped transform Palm Springs into a
mecca of what might be called leisure modernism comparable to Miami
Beach. Notable projects there included the Palm Springs City Hall,
designed in partnership with John Porter Clark and Robson Chambers;
the Raymond Loewy house, done for the famous industrial designer
along with Clark, and the Tramway Valley Station and Gas Station,
another project with Chambers, which has a hyperbolic paraboloid
roof that serves as the visual gateway to the city.
</P>
<P>
   His own homes, Frey 1 and Frey 2, encapsulated the man in their
spare elegance perfectly attuned to the landscape. Both houses are
made of corrugated aluminum and glass. Frey I, which has been
substantially altered over the years by subsequent owners, featured
a stairway and dining table suspended by cables from the ceiling.
Frey 2, where the architect lived from the '60s on, is centered on
a single room built around a boulder.
</P>
<P>
   With the resurgent interest in modernism in the last decade,
Frey is once again in vogue. This fall a monograph on his homes was
published and there was an exhibition on the Aluminaire house at
the Architectural League.
</P>
<P>
   In retirement since 1990, he nevertheless agreed last summer to
do some house sketches for an executive at Gucci. He is survived by
a sister, Emma Schneider, who lives in Herrliberg, Switzerland.

COLUMN: A RODENT MOURNED 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cinderelli, we hardly knew ye.
</P>
<P>
   That sentence has been uttered in more than one office since a
certain letter began inspiring debates about the emotional health
of New York children. The letter, which has been making the rounds
of fax and photocopy machines, was originally sent last month to
the parents of the 2- and 3-year-olds in the Red Room class of the
First Presbyterian Church Nursery School, at West 12th Street and
Fifth Avenue. It was a message from the school's director, Ellen
Ziman:
</P>
<P>
   ``As most of you already know, the Red Room hamster `Cinderelli
Fluffy' became sick about a month ago. Dr. Dale Rubin of Gramercy
Park Animal Hospital arranged for Cinderelli to be treated at the
hospital, where she was given the very best of care by Drs. Rubin
and Kuhlman and their staff. Despite their efforts, Cinderelli did
not recover. At that time the children were adjusting to a change
of teachers and we decided to limit them to one adjustment at a
time. They seem to have accepted Cinderelli's absence but we feel
that they need to know that she will not be coming back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be talking with the children about Cinderelli, reading
them some books about the vet, and about the life cycle. They will
talk about what they remember about Cinderelli and make a book. In
a little while we will think about getting another pet for the
classroom. Please feel free to talk with me or the teachers about
any concerns you have.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter has raised a number of questions around water
coolers, starting with: Is this really necessary? When today's
adults look back on their own brushes with hamster mortality, they
generally do not recall teams of medical specialists and official
discussions of grief management. After reading the letter, one
middle-aged woman recalled that her mourning process had consisted
of an older brother's explaining, ``Hey, the (expletive) hamster's
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Have Americans become so in touch with their feelings that they
now require bereavement counselors to cope with the loss of
rodents? Possibly, although some suspect that it's chiefly a New
York phenomenon, the result partly of the city's obsessive parents
and partly of its strained relationship with nature. The loss of a
hamster would presumably loom less large in places where children
are exposed to richer ecosystems.
</P>
<P>
   Still, is this the best way to prepare New York children for
future careers in the city? One Wall Street trader wonders how
these sensitized children would fare in his line of work. ``Would
you feel confident investing your money,'' he asked, ``with someone
who can only handle one adjustment at a time? I can see one of
these kids telling his staff not to disturb him with any bad news
from the Nikkei exchange until he recovers from the trauma of
hiring a new secretary.''
</P>
<P>
   But this was all idle speculation. A field investigation of
Cinderelli's death was essential, and Ms. Ziman graciously allowed
it Wednesday morning. She explained that Cinderelli had been
suffering from skin lesions when veterinarians nearby offered to
provide extraordinary treatment free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vets don't usually deal with exotics,'' she said. ``That's
what they call rodents. But they knew how attached we were to
Cinderelli, so they did some reading and developed an antibiotic to
treat her.'' Cinderelli's condition initially improved, but then
finally overwhelmed medical science, whereupon some parents
suggested trying to fool the children with a substitute Cinderelli.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't do that,'' Ms. Ziman said, ``because the children
would have known, and because we saw this as a real opportunity for
learning. Children need to be able to deal with death and their
feelings of loss. In the past, people didn't take young children's
feelings so seriously, but now we know how tremendously important
their early development is.''
</P>
<P>
   The children filled the Cinderelli memorial book by making
watercolor paintings and dictating comments like ``I feel mad
because Cinderelli is not here,'' ``I remember she had a Ferris
wheel'' and ``She liked her cage.'' Most didn't have a lot of
specific memories, because Cinderelli had spent most of the
daylight hours asleep, but there were some ringing testimonials
nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the greatest hamster,'' a 3-year-old named Luke
recorded in the book. ``I remember about the scraping thing she
goes under. And her drinking from the bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   They all seemed to be coping well Wednesday morning as they
gathered around the cage of the Red Room's new pet, a guinea pig
named Rascal. When asked about Cinderelli, several of them
matter-of-factly replied, ``She died,'' and then rushed off to
resume work building a highway of wooden blocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're moving on to new things,'' Ms. Ziman said.

CLEMENS DEMANDS TO BE TRADED 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Roger Clemens was a free agent two years ago, he shunned
two teams that had been and would continue to be legitimate
contenders, the New York Yankees and the Cleveland Indians. Now,
after winning his fourth and unprecedented fifth Cy Young awards
but no championships with the Toronto Blue Jays, Clemens wants to
be traded to a contender.
</P>
<P>
   The pitcher made that request Wednesday through his agent, and
the Blue Jays, adhering to a verbal commitment made two years ago,
said they would comply. Gord Ash, the team's general manager, said
he wanted to move as quickly as possible, in the next week to 10
days.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd say I'm on a fast track with this,'' Ash said by telephone
from Toronto. ``There are so many other things going on with free
agents and other deals, we need to have this clarified before we
move on.''
</P>
<P>
   After speaking with Clemens' agent, Randy Hendricks, Ash wasted
no time. He immediately contacted the Yankees, Cleveland, Texas and
Houston, teams, he said, that had shown the strongest interest
dating to last July. He said he expected to talk to other teams as
soon as the news spread.
</P>
<P>
   Ash said that Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, told
him he would have to talk to George Steinbrenner and would get back
to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very interested at the trade deadline, so one could
assume they still are,'' Ash said.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians, Rangers and Astros, he added, all said they were
very interested and would be in touch with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be looking for players who could help us at the major
league level now,'' Ash said. ``Prospects aren't going to work.
We're going to need at least some pitching back, but I want to be
open minded about this. I don't want to predetermine what it will
take. I want to see what the offers are.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that the Rangers, Astros and Indians all have been seeking
pitching to bolster their staffs, the Yankees would seem to be in
the best position to include a starting pitcher because they have
six. But would the Blue Jays really trade Clemens to a team in
their division?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've debated that,'' Ash said. ``I don't see that as a
roadblock. What we have to concentrate on is getting the best
possible deal. If that presents itself from within the division,
that would be unusual, but you have to do what you have to do both
short and long term.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens has two years left on the contract he signed in January
1997, after Paul Beeston, then the club's president, convinced him
the Blue Jays would be a contender. Clemens, whom the Boston Red
Sox let leave as a free agent because they viewed him as an aging
pitcher, accepted the Toronto offer because he felt the environment
there would be best for his family.

 &HT;    Glenn announces launch of Ohio State public service institute at
event
 &HT;    By Scott Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The party for Sen. John Glenn's return to
Washington drew Vice President Al Gore and about 400 other guests
Wednesday night, and pulled Ohio State University into a bit of the
beltway glitz.
</P>
<P>
   Black-tied servers toted hors d'oeuvres and guests sipped
cocktails amid the spectacular and ingenious furnishings of the
main hall of the National Air and Space Museum.
</P>
<P>
   At center stage was, of course, the Friendship 7 Mercury capsule
that Glenn flew into history as the first American to orbit the
Earth in 1962. Suspended above it, the 1903 Wright Flyer.
</P>
<P>
   Off center stage, but not too far from it, was a wall of
photographs taken during Glenn's latest foray into space, the
November flight of the space shuttle Discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Also on hand was Air Force Lt. Col. Steve Lindsey, who was the
pilot on Glenn's flight, and Dr. Scott Parazynski, another crew
member.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's gala was Glenn's first public appearance in
Washington since he became the oldest man in space at age 77.
</P>
<P>
   But space was only a backdrop. The evening's purpose was to
announce the launch of Glenn's ``next mission,'' creation of the
John Glenn Institute for Public Service and Public Policy at Ohio
State.
</P>
<P>
   OSU announced the creation of the Glenn Institute in September,
with excitement and fanfare at a Buckeye football weekend. Glenn
and his wife, Annie, were introduced to an adoring stadium crowd at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's gala was aimed at more than adulation. The
Glenn Institute, which will open in January with $20 million in
start-up cash already budgeted, needs national visibility to
attract corporate sponsors for the long term. The school hopes one
day to rival the John Kennedy School of Government at Harvard
University, but with a greater emphasis on developing
civic-mindedness and a greater interest in working with younger
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased, obviously, by the turnout,'' Glenn said,
``and I think I'm thrilled to see this kind of support for
something that I believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   OSU President William Kirwan said the gala was important to get
the new Glenn school the kind of attention needed to draw policy
leaders and program sponsors to help build the school's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a wonderful turnout,'' said Herb Asher, a
political science professor at OSU who postponed retirement to
direct the Glenn Institute until a permanent replacement is found
next year. ``And to get the Vice President's ringing
endorsement...we're just thrilled.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore appeared in a private reception before the main event,
which included an IMAX theater movie on Glenn's life and latest
space mission.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the Glenn Institute will be housed in OSU's Bricker
Hall, but eventually could get its own building. It is one of a
handful of high-priority capital projects being touted as part of
the university's $1 billion fund-raising campaign called Affirm Thy
Friendship.
</P>
<P>
   The gala was Glenn's first public appearance in Washington since
he became the oldest man in space. His nine-day space shuttle ride
aboard Discovery ended Nov. 7, more than 36 years after Glenn
became the first American in orbit aboard a tiny Mercury capsule.
</P>
<P>
   The Glenns returned to Washington last Saturday, after driving
up from Houston, where Glenn underwent weeks of postflight medical
tests at the Johnson Space Center. The car trip was a private
adventure, their first in ages, in which Annie Glenn had said she
looked forward to being simply ``Mr. and Mrs. Glenn.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. and Mrs. Glenn celebrated Thanksgiving on the road _ at the
Shoney's buffet in Hattiesburg, Miss.

ON PAPER, METS STILL TRAIL BRAVES AND YANKS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Think it's easy being the Mets? They've spent the
last six weeks trying to catch up with two teams, one in their
division, the other in their city. They have made many moves as
part of that effort, but a miracle has not been among them.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the Mets do, they continue to face a daunting
task. When the season ended they were 18 games behind the Atlanta
Braves and galaxies of interest behind the World Series champion
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The standings, of course, don't carry over to next season, but
the strengths of the teams do.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves will begin the last season of this millennium with
the core of their starting pitching rotation intact. They traded
Denny Neagle, but they still have Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and John
Smoltz, owners of the last seven Cy Young awards. They also
fortified their hitting and their defense with the acquisition of
second baseman Bret Boone and right fielder Brian Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees will begin next season with their entire team
intact. That is bad news for a lot of teams, not only the Mets.
Think of how Baltimore and Boston must feel. But as much as the
Mets don't have to compete with the Yankees for a division title
during the summer, they compete with them for the metropolitan
area's attention year round.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people to come to Shea, too,'' a member of the Mets
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Giving Mike Piazza $91 million had at least as much to do with
the Yankees as the Braves. Overpaying by $20 million to $30 million
was a steep premium to pay, but it is Fred Wilpon's and Nelson
Doubleday's money, and in one sense it was strategically spent.
</P>
<P>
   The Piazza signing, stunning as it was coming from the Mets,
abruptly halted the runaway euphoria emanating from the Yankees'
World Series conquest.
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Steve Phillips spent another chunk of the
owners' money Wednesday, giving Robin Ventura $32 million for four
years and completing what should be an airtight infield. Besides
the expenditure, the most interesting aspect of the signing was
Ventura's decision to choose the Mets over the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it was a better fit,'' Ventura said in a conference
call Wednesday. ``After being on a very young team, it's nice to be
on a team with some veterans.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those players, he said, helped sell him on the idea of
joining the Mets. He said he spoke with Piazza, Al Leiter and
Dennis Cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were excited; there was a sense that the team is going to
win,'' Ventura said. ``The feeling was you better jump on now or
we're going on without you. I had the opportunity to go other
places. To me, it boils down to the best chances for winning. I
expect this is my best chance to win and I expect to win here.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura's arrival gives the Mets a Gold Glove left side of the
infield. The players on the right side wear conventional gloves,
but they use them well. The same cannot necessarily be said for
much of the outfield. The pitchers' task, then, will be obvious:
keep the ball in the infield.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Reed, Bobby Jones and Masato Yoshii should especially
benefit from the solid infield defense. They throw strikes and
force batters to hit the ball. The more flawlessly fielded balls
they get, the better their chances of winning. Good defense helps
make average or good pitching better. Bad defense undermines good
pitching. Good defense also produces more double plays, another
element that makes pitching better.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura's presence in the lineup also expands the heavy-hitting
part of the batting order, teaming him in the middle with John
Olerud, Piazza and Bobby Bonilla. The lineup's missing link is a
legitimate leadoff hitter.
</P>
<P>
   If the Mets make no other moves _ that is, if they do not
acquire a legitimate leadoff hitter _ the assignment will most
likely fall to Brian McRae, who in 51 games as the leadoff hitter
last season had mixed success. But the Mets may sign Rickey
Henderson for a year, hoping that even if he can't hit much any
more, he could still walk to first and steal second.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, an outfield with Henderson and Bonilla is
reminiscent of the moves the Mets made before the 1992 season that
they thought would produce a division championship. They spent the
next five years recovering from the disaster those moves turned out
to be.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, who had a $58.66 million payroll last season, raised
their 1999 payroll to $52.7 million for the 14 players who are
signed. The Yankees have 17 players signed for a total of $66
million, but they still must add the salaries of Derek Jeter, Andy
Pettitte and Mariano Rivera to that total. The Mets' roster of
unsigned players doesn't include equivalent young stars.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets don't necessarily want to catch up to the Yankees in
the salary standing. If they can get 50 percent of the area's
attention, they will consider their busy off season a worthwhile
endeavor.

CONDUCTING A SEASON, JOYFUL AND TRIUMPHANT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa, N.Y.)  (bl) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Kent Tritle grew up on a century-old family farm in a
corner of Iowa, founded a high school rock band that played at
proms across the prairie, graduated from the Juilliard School,
transformed the music program at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola
on Park Avenue into one of the best in the city, performed as an
organist with the New York Philharmonic and two springs ago bailed
out the family farm when his bankrupt parents couldn't afford to
plant the soybean crop.
</P>
<P>
   In a city of 1,000 stories, his is a good one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think of this in terms of having come full circle,''
Tritle said. ``But I'm amazed at the sequence of things that have
happened. The doors have opened, and allowed me to do more, and
better. People who are removed from agriculture may not understand
what the farm means. But it's the only choice I can make. That's
what I am.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Tritle, the music director at St. Ignatius Loyola,
one of the more beautiful churches in the city, is also part of the
essence of Christmas in New York _ a person who walks the aisle
between the spiritual and the entertaining and who brings forth the
season's Handel, Bach and various renditions of ``Joy to the
World.''
</P>
<P>
   Tritle will conduct the Dec. 20 Holiday Concert at St. Ignatius
Loyola _ ``It's our big warm fuzzy of the year'' _ plus the music
for the church's Roman Catholic Masses on Christmas Eve and
Christmas Day. Tritle, 38, is also music director of the Desoff
Choirs (they perform at St. Ignatius on Dec. 11), a faculty member
at Juilliard, the founder of the Sacred Music in a Sacred Space
concert series and a principal organist with the American Symphony
Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a little tired,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, he has helped make St. Ignatius such a star that Lincoln
Center now holds its Music of the Spirit concert series there.
Plus, he directed the music at Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis' funeral
there _ he played the organ when Jessye Norman sang ``Ave Maria'' _
and also conducted for the lavish St. Ignatius wedding of Alexandra
and Alexandre von Furstenberg. All in all, he is in charge of 450
services with music a year.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Tritle (pronounced as in title) talked for two hours
about himself and his music in the church's choir loft, at the foot
of a $1.25 million, 40-ton, four-story organ that he helped bring
to the church in 1993. This is a whole other subject, but briefly,
the behemoth is a rare mechanical-action organ, built mostly by
hand over 18 months; it is one of the largest in the country, and
looks like the spires of Oz. Tritle showed it off by playing the
thunderous allegro from Charles-Marie Widor's Symphony No. 6 in G
minor. It made the floor vibrate madly and sounded like the end of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apocalyptic!'' Tritle said, enthralled. ``It's big! It's
thunderous! It's beyond all scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Tritle is an enthusiast, and still seems a little startled by
the good fortune in his life. He said the best part of his many
jobs was teaching music to different kinds of people, from St.
Ignatius' paid, professional choir _ most big churches in Manhattan
have one _ to its ``volunteer'' choir composed of parishioners and
anyone who walks in humming off the street. (Some members of the
choir are Jewish. Tritle is Methodist. St. Ignatius is run by the
Jesuits.)
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the two choirs, Tritle said, ``is like
the difference between driving the old Farmall tractor and a
Rolls-Royce _ but each ride can be a lot of fun.'' With the
tractor, ``you've got the breeze, you've got the smell, you've got
the clods of earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's what it's like with the volunteer choir _ you've
got all the humanness.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Tritle conducted the volunteer choir in a
practice of ``O Come All Ye Faithful.'' He praised them constantly
but stopped them frequently, as after the phrase ``joyful and
triumphant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be joyful about the word joyful,'' he instructed.
``Joyful has to draw you like a magnet.'' And then later: ``Flex
the knees, hang the tail _ relax!'' The choir, cheery and
purposeful, basked in Tritle's attention. ``He's a doll,'' said
Susan Kasluga, a flight attendant for American Airlines. ``He has
the patience of a saint.''
</P>
<P>
   While he was growing up in Spirit Lake (population 4,000), in
Iowa's northwest corner, Tritle thought he might be a veterinarian
_ he delivered pigs and cattle on the farm, and saw a favorite colt
die _ but came to see the creation of music as mystical, like birth
and death. ``Music comes from nature, ultimately,'' he said. When
his choirs sing, ``there is incredible human communication, and I
think present in that communication is God.''
</P>
<P>
   All is not perfect in Tritle's life. His younger brother,
Daniel, at the height of the family's money problems, sold cattle
that did not belong to him and is expected to be sentenced next
month to three years in prison. Tritle's parents do not like to
talk about his 10-year relationship with Arthur Fiacco, a cellist,
who lives with Tritle on the Upper West Side. But Tritle knows that
he helped save the family farm _ now 56 acres, down from 156 _ and
that what he calls a ``black hole'' back home is coming toward
light.
</P>
<P>
   ``I experienced the best of small-town America,'' he said. ``In
the summer of 1982, before heading off to Juilliard, I gave two
organ recitals. And they all turned out, and they put so much money
in the plate.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans overwhelmingly told their
leadership Wednesday they wanted to bring impeachment to a quick
vote this month in the House, as the Judiciary Committee, under
criticism for expanding its inquiry, appeared to be moving to wrap
up the investigation by the end of next week.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans made their views known as the staff of Rep. Tom
DeLay, R-Texas, the majority whip, reached across the country in a
conference call to informally gauge Republican support for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The conference call came after several days in which the House
Judiciary Committee looked like it wanted to expand its
investigation of President Clinton's relationship with Monica
Lewinsky to also include campaign financing, raising the
possibility that the proceeding could spill over into next year.
The committee's recent moves into other areas have worried some
Republicans and Democrats, who cite the public's general opposition
to impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill, the Judiciary chairman, made it clear
Wednesday, however, that he wanted to proceed on schedule, even as
his committee investigators reviewed two secret Justice Department
memorandums on alleged fund-raising abuses. Hyde would not
characterizing their contents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is little appetite to pursue this past the first of the
year,'' said Rep. Bill Paxon, R-N.Y. ``Most members, whether they
are for impeachment or not, want to get this over with. They see it
is a political disaster to have it in the next Congress. Unless
there's something more, most members would want an up or down vote
and get it over with.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Scanlon, a spokesman for DeLay, said the Texas
Republican was not trying to push the vote on impeachment in any
direction. ``These are members talking to DeLay,'' he said. ``We
weren't telling them where we are. Tom got on the conference calls,
asked a few questions and shut up. These were members talking.''
</P>
<P>
   He said their overwhelming sentiment was to move quickly to a
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Scanlon asserted there was no formal vote counting. But by day's
end, Republicans said it was clear there were up to 12 Republican
votes against impeachment and another small core group of moderates
still unwilling to commit.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic leaders say they believe that only three to five of
their members will turn against Clinton. If Republicans lose only
12 votes, they could narrowly pass iompeachment if several
Democrats break ranks.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, meanwhile, Wednesday accepted the Judiciary
Committee's invitation to present its case next Tuesday. But it
left open the possibility that Clinton's lawyers may call
witnesses. In a letter to Hyde, White House counsel Charles Ruff
and Gregory Craig, a presidential assistant, sought access to
sealed material held by the committee before Clinton's lawyers
appear.
</P>
<P>
   Paul McNulty, a committee spokesman, suggested that the panel
would be unlikely to turn over sealed material. ``If the
president's lawyers want to examine Justice Department memos
outlining a criminal investigation possibly involving the president
and the vice president, they should take that up with Attorney
General Janet Reno,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans accused the White House itself of stalling. ``People
up here are not amused,'' an aide to Republican leaders said.
``There is concern growing that this is not a good faith acceptance
of an offer to testify. Rather it is more of a tactic to push the
schedule back, particularly where it may come up against
Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   The rapid series of events came amid new signs that Republicans
also overwhelmingly opposed sending a censure resolution to the
floor right now, and most likely not even if an impeachment vote
was defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Livingston, the incoming speaker, who has come under
criticism from Republicans and from Rep. Dick Gephardt, the House
minority leader, for his failure to take charge of the impeachment
process, was to meet with DeLay on Thursday. His spokesman, Mark
Corallo, said that Livingston would continue to defer to Hyde until
the committee had ended its inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to dispel the impression that its inquiry could spill
over into the new year, the committee put out a tentative schedule
to wrap up final hearings next week and then allot next Thursday,
Friday and possibly and Saturday for debate and votes on articles
of impeachment. That would allow the House to convene and vote on
any articles of impeachment the week of Dec. 14.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans counted as a victory a judge's decision to grant
committee investigators the right to review two secret Justice
Department memorandums, in which FBI Director Louis Freeh and
Charles La Bella, a former Justice Department prosecutor, made the
case that Reno should name an independent counsel to investigate
Clinton's 1996 campaign finance practices.
</P>
<P>
   Under an order by U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson,
one Republican and one Democratic investigator from the panel were
permitted Wednesday to read the full memorandums. The investigators
_ David Schippers, the chief Republican investigative counsel and
Kevin Simpson, a Democratic counsel _ were not allowed to take
notes or photocopy the material, conditions requested by the
Justice Department to protect grand jury information contained in
the documents.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans had subpoenaed the documents after saying they
had received information they could contain allegations of
wrongdoing by the president.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Conyers, the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary
Committee said Wednesday night that the four hours of review of the
memos had found they were not ``in any way relevant'' to the
inquiry into the president. ``We trust that this closes a short and
unproductive chapter of this very strange proceeding,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans did not characterize what they had found. But
one Republican official emphasized that unless there was
``stunning, stunning'' information, Hyde wanted to complete work
and report out one or more articles of impeachment to the House on
schedule by the end of next week.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they would take a closed deposition from
LaBella on Friday and could possibly schedule Freeh for the same
day.
</P>
<P>
   The drive to expand the inquiry into campaign finance has been
spearheaded by Schippers, the committee's chief investigative
counsel, who would like to rule out possible wrongdoing, Republican
and Democratic aides said. One Republican aide said there is a
possibility that Schippers may continue his investigation into
campaign finance abuses next year, after the impeachment inquiry's
resolution, as part of his original mandate.
</P>
<P>
   But shutting down another avenue of inquiry, they said it was
now unlikely that they would question Bruce Lindsey, a deputy White
House counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the committee moves steadily on its course toward
impeaching the president, Democrats and some Republicans have been
pushing instead for Clinton to be censured in strong terms. But
Republicans said that support for censure among their members had
been steadily eroding for a variety of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   They said that even many moderate Republicans were infuriated by
Clinton's legalistic and unrepentant answers to 81 questions sent
him by the Judiciary Committee. Conservative Republicans believe
that tactically they will gain more votes for impeachment if
censure is not an alternative. And some Republicans believe their
party can run against Democrats as the party of sex and perjury if
Democrats are prohibited from going on for censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more the Democrats are on TV talking away on censure, the
less inclined the Republicans are to support censure,'' Paxon said.
``They see it as nothing more than a political out for the
Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   But several other Republicans said they are still quietly trying
to craft a censure option and hoped that Livingston might be
receptive to them once Hyde has finished his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a floating crap game,'' said one Republican still
working against the odds for censure. He said Livingston did not
want to undermine Hyde.

 A WEATHERMAN AS DOWNHILL SEER 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's appropriate, somehow, that anyone calling himself a skiing
weatherman might also ski. Isn't it easier for skiers and boarders
facing wet snow or ice to know that their meteorologist might also
be boot-deep in slush or skidding on boilerplate?
</P>
<P>
   Such is the psychic fallout affecting Herb Stevens, the
television weatherman who disseminates a weekly forecast of 1
minute 25 seconds on 30 stations from Florida to Maine. He has an
opinion on all weather subjects, especially if the subject is as
debatable as La Nina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give skiers a look into the future of weather, rather than
telling them what the weather is on any one day,'' Stevens said
from his office in North Kingstown, R.I. ``That's particularly true
of ski conditions in the East, where weather changes so rapidly. In
Colorado, once the snow surface is established, it stays fairly
similar except for occasional dumps of new snow. But in the East,
we can undergo three surface changes in 24 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens has deduced that La Nina _ El Nino is the warming
phenomenon in the equatorial Pacific Ocean that affects the climate
around the globe, and La Nina is its associated cooling phase _
will bring more cold air and snow than usual to the Northeast this
winter, despite the region's recent stretch of warm weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be with us throughout the winter and into the
spring,'' he predicted. ``Whereas the southern portion of the jet
stream was more active and powerful last year, the opposite is apt
to prevail this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Ski areas within the shadow of the Great Lakes and Lake
Champlain are likely to receive snow from cold air masses sweeping
over the lakes from Canada, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Benefiting will be areas in Northern Vermont especially, such as
Smugglers' Notch, Jay Peak, Sugarbush and Mad River Glen. The lake
effect could be felt as far south as New York, Pennsylvania and
West Virginia, Stevens said. Indeed, areas such as Smugglers' Notch
had a record snowfall during the last La Nina period, which came
during the 1995-96 ski season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a meltdown, you can make up for it,'' said Barbara
Thomke, a spokeswoman for Smugglers' Notch. Last winter, however,
the cold spells did not last long enough for many ski areas to
recoup their losses from warm spells. Smugglers', for example, had
219 inches of snowfall last season compared with 334 inches in
1995-96.
</P>
<P>
   Resorts able to make snow will benefit not only from natural
accumulations, but also from the ability to make snow and count on
it lasting through occasional thaws. Ski areas more to the east,
such as those in Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Massachusetts
and Southeastern New York, according to Stevens, are outside the
lake effect band. But they are still apt to have a
better-than-average winter.
</P>
<P>
   Areas in the Catskills, such as Hunter Mountain, were open in
early November this year during a mid-autumn cold spell. But then
they had to close and reopen.
</P>
<P>
   The West will experience a different La Nina effect, Stevens
said. The southern Rockies are likely to see a drier and milder
winter than they had last season with the huge dumps of snow
brought on by El Nino. But in the northern climes, the opposite is
predicted. ``I'd say stay north of Interstate 70,'' Stevens said,
referring to the highway that cuts through the Rocky Mountains
outside of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Harris, a climatologist in Jericho, Vt., sees a similar
picture. ``La Nina takes what is normal and enhances the pattern,''
he said. ``But during the El Nino periods, which the country is
just pulling out of, the opposite was true. Dry areas turned
wetter, wet areas turned drier, and normally cold areas turn
warmer.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Last year, we had a relatively snowless winter in
the Northeast. El Nino was holding all that cold weather at bay. In
Northern New England, we had flooding and the worst ice storm in
history. But here in Vermont, things are fairly normal right now. I
don't expect the really harsh, cold stuff, the main body of the
serpent, to come in at least until the end of December.''

   As for keeping tabs on snow levels, Stevens suggests that skiers
and snowboarders pay attention to general lists as well as rely on
individual ski areas for reports. ``Ski areas are more accountable
now than they used to be,'' he said. ``I can say that because I'm a
meteorologist, and I know whether they get snow or not.''

THEODORE STRONGIN, 79, CRITIC WHO CHAMPIONED CONTEMPORARY MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Theodore Strongin, a music critic for The New York Times in the
1960s, died Nov. 24 at St. Joseph's Hospital in Asheville, N.C. He
was 79 and lived in Englewood, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was leukemia, said his daughter, Debby Randolph.
</P>
<P>
   Strongin began writing about music for The Times in 1963, and
within his first few months at the paper he produced an extensive
report about the acoustical deficiencies of Philharmonic (now Avery
Fisher) Hall, with material from a secret architects' report
showing that the hall's interior had to be rebuilt, and quotations
from musicians and conductors who were critical of the hall's sound
a year after it opened.
</P>
<P>
   As a reviewer, Strongin was particularly interested in
contemporary music. He had been a composer himself, and in the
1950s several of his works, including a Suite for Unaccompanied
Cello and an Oboe Quintet, were performed in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Strongin was born in New York in 1918 and grew up in Darien,
Conn. He attended Harvard University and Bard College, where he
studied music and biology. His specialty was entomology, the study
of insects, and he identified several rare species of beetles for
the American Museum of Natural History. After military service,
between 1942 and 1946, he attended the Juilliard School and
Columbia Graduate School, where he studied flute and composition.
</P>
<P>
   He began his newspaper career as a reviewer for The New York
Herald Tribune in the early 1950s but gave up reviewing briefly to
teach composition at Bennington College and Dartmouth. He returned
to writing in 1957, when he became the arts editor and music critic
for The Chattanooga Times. He held the same positions at The
Knickerbocker News, in Albany, N.Y., from 1961 until he joined The
Times in 1963. He remained at The Times until 1970, when he
retired, moved to East Hampton, N.Y., and occasionally contributed
reviews to The East Hampton Star.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his daughter, of Manhattan, he is survived by a
son, Daniel of Richmond, Calif.; a grandson, John Randolph of
Manhattan; two stepdaughters, Alice Friedman of Fern Park, Fla.,
and Judith Rosenberg of Austin, Texas, and his companion, Leah
Lasbury.

<P>
   Rams coach Dick Vermeil left Philadelphia in 1982 because he was
burned out. Eagles coach Ray Rhodes will likely be leaving soon
because he didn't win many games. Two emotional coaches with bad
teams take center stage in this battle-for-pride drama. Vermeil
said Tony Banks, not Steve Bono, will again start at quarterback.
How bad is the Eagles' offense? Last week, Koy Detmer threw
Philadelphia's first two touchdown passes of the season to wide
receivers. They may not score Thursday night, but Rhodes wins a
game that only gamblers and players' families may watch.

N.Y. LEGISLATURE MOVES TO END TENURE FOR PRINCIPALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York state Senate passed a bill Wednesday night that
would abolish tenure for principals, amid signs that the New York
City Board of Education and the principals' union were moving
closer to a compromise plan that would make it easier for New York
City Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew to get rid of principals who are
failing.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill, passed in a last-minute flurry of negotiations,
would replace tenure with three-year renewable contracts.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, the chancellor and local school
superintendents would evaluate principals annually and could
dismiss them after two bad evaluations. Principals would have the
right to appeal through an accelerated hearing process under the
jurisdiction of the Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Also, New York City's chancellor would have final authority to
dismiss a principal. In the rest of the state, the local
superintendents would have that power.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill passed as momentum built around a second,
slightly more moderate proposal to expand the school system's
ability to get rid of incompetent principals while still preserving
their rights to lesser jobs within the school system. City and
state officials indicated last night that this proposal could
become the basis for an eventual compromise, though not in the
current legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Crew have pushed for a
tough bill on principal tenure, calling for its abolition and
replacement by contracts _ a proposal similar to the bill passed by
the Senate. Their approval would be essential to any compromise.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Officials familiar with the negotiations said that while the
Board of Education was interested in making a deal, the mayor was
holding out for the complete abolition of tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Colleen Roche, a spokeswoman for Giuliani, said Wednesday that
the Senate bill ``certainly doesn't go as far as the mayor believes
we should go, but it's a step in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The fight over tenure has led to a stalemate in contract talks
among the Board of Education and Giuliani administration and the
principal's union, the Council of Supervisors and Administrators.
The union has been working without a contract for nearly two years.
Talks reached an impasse in September, when the principals refused
a raise of more than 30 percent in exchange for giving up tenure
and working a 12-month year and longer days.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators in the Democratic-led State Assembly said that the
Assembly would oppose any change in the tenure system for New York
City principals that had not first been negotiated in contract
talks with the principals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not prepared to put in a bill right now that guts the
collective bargaining talks which are ongoing,'' said Steven
Sanders, chairman of the Assembly Education Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But Sanders said, ``There are issues that both sides agree with
that deal with accountability and an expedited review process, and
I believe if the negotiators were allowed to proceed under those
parameters, without the Damocles sword of having to excise from the
law the word tenure, it is a very reasonable expectation that they
could come to an agreement.''

CHANGING OF THE GUARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ Don't bother Jelani Gardner with any axioms
about how life imitates art. In his case, life has imitated hoop.
</P>
<P>
   Really. Spend a few minutes with this Pepperdine point guard,
discuss his messy exit from Cal nearly three years ago, and it's
undeniable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a bad guy. I was a bad person,'' Gardner said of his
recent past. ``I was really arrogant and cocky, thinking the world
revolved around me.''
</P>
<P>
   With the ball, or off the court without it, this was one selfish
person. Gardner freely admits it. In fact, that word popped up
frequently as he discussed those heady days when he left St. John
Bosco High in Bellflower as one of the most hotly recruited guards
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Get him talking about his current state of affairs at
Pepperdine, however, and an antonym works its way into his speech:
selfless. Gardner, in his final year of college eligibility, said
he is finally learning the value of deferring to teammates on the
court. And conducting himself humbly away from it.
</P>
<P>
   The painstaking process will continue Saturday as Gardner leads
the 5-1 Waves against seventh-ranked Kansas at the Wooden Classic
in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taken a lot of patience on our part, because he's done it
his way for 20 years,'' said Pepperdine coach Lorenzo Romar, who is
also one of Gardner's closest friends. ``It's like removing bricks
from a wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardner's way worked pretty well for a long time. He was a
McDonald's All-Star and atop the wish lists of such programs as
UCLA and Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   He selected Cal, he said today with a blush, ``for a selfish
reason, because as a freshman I would be able to start, whereas on
the other teams they had great players on returning teams and I
would have had to wait my turn.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about my future and going to the NBA early,''
he went on. ``Even in high school, as a junior, I was thinking
three years in college and out.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardner wanted to be the center of attention. He certainly got
his wish at Cal. Friction with then-coach Todd Bozeman during
Gardner's sophomore season led to a lost starting job and increased
time on the bench, which flustered Jelani and incensed his dad, Tom
Gardner, who wasn't exactly living down his reputation as a
meddlesome stage father.
</P>
<P>
   Jelani Gardner ultimately asked for a release from his
scholarship and transferred to Pepperdine to play for Romar, who,
as an assistant coach at UCLA, had been central to the Bruins'
recruitment of him.
</P>
<P>
   Then matters really got sordid. Tom Gardner, admitting at the
time that he wanted to see Bozeman fired, blew the whistle on the
coach with the NCAA. The allegation held that Bozeman, working in
conjunction with former agent James Casey and former NBA player
Butch Carter, had funneled $30,000 over two years to . . .the
Gardners.
</P>
<P>
   The payoff had been agreed to when Jelani was in high school,
and was contingent upon his attending Cal. Tom maintained that
Jelani knew nothing of the scheme and insisted that his son was
never pressured by the family to attend Cal.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bizarre tale, but a Cal investigation resulted in
Bozeman's ouster, and the NCAA's subsequent probe resulted in a
three-year probation for the Bears.
</P>
<P>
   Jelani Gardner carries the taint around with him to this day,
whether he likes it or not. ``I had nothing to do with it,'' he
said this week while reclined in the bleachers after practice at
Firestone Fieldhouse. ``I guess a lot of people didn't believe
that. Maybe it's hard to believe, but I really didn't know anything
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   From the family home in West Covina, Tom Gardner approached the
subject as he would an appointment to get his gums scraped. After
rebuffing at least three queries on the subject, he finally said,
``I've gone through this kind of conversation a million times, and
I think I've expressed my regret enough. This is behind us. . . .
I've talked about Cal more than enough. No question about it, it
impacted us, it impacted J, it impacted a lot of people. It's very
regrettable.''
</P>
<P>
   Jelani Gardner can't look back on the entire Cal experience
without reaching, however briefly, the same conclusion. He had to
sit out a year after transferring, and now he's playing far from
the bright lights and packed arenas of the Pacific-10.
</P>
<P>
   The next Jason Kidd? A future lottery pick? Now he's just
laboring to be considered for a job at the next level. But Gardner
hastens to add an important caveat: The experiences, he said,
humbled him and had a refining effect.
</P>
<P>
   Over a period of a few weeks in 1996, Gardner feuded with his
coach, saw his playing time shrivel, struggled with his health,
executed a transfer to another school and left an explosive scandal
in his wake.
</P>
<P>
   At a particularly low point, he said, he became a Christian, and
with that came a much different perspective on life. ``If all that
stuff wouldn't have happened to me, I wouldn't be where I am now,''
Gardner said, ``and I would be a totally different person, a person
that most people wouldn't want to have contact with.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, overall, I'm thankful that all that stuff happened. It
changed me tremendously, not only in basketball but more as a
person.''
</P>
<P>
   The old Jelani Gardner wasn't difficult to spot. The persona was
especially evident on the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overdribbling the ball,'' Romar said with a roll of his eyes.
``Overhandling it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardner recalls the preoccupation with making spectacular
passes, with having little game plan beyond popping from the top of
the key or driving into the paint and kicking to a teammate.
</P>
<P>
   The source of his on-court troubles at Cal? Gardner smiled
sheepishly and said, ``The coach was basically trying to get me to
do the same thing that I'm doing now. I just didn't understand. But
I don't think he taught me the way coach Romar did. . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to think helping my team was always making something
happen, whereas sometimes you can run your team by letting the
offense run _ hit the guy coming off a screen, set a screen, do the
little things to help your team.''
</P>
<P>
   So far this young season, Gardner has employed this formula to
lead the Waves in assists (6.5) and minutes (35) per game, while
scoring a modest 12.2 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   His anemic shooting percentage _ 37.9 percent _ is attributed to
the attention he is attracting from defenses, while perhaps half of
his 22 turnovers, a Pepperdine official said, would have resulted
in points had the recipient of his passes shared Gardner's
considerable athleticism.
</P>
<P>
   But Gardner's approach has been altered, his attitude is
different. And he considers those the greater achievements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like when you're selfless and worry about your
team,'' he said, ``the more things happen for you.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the same way it is in life. If you worry about treating
others well, then you'll be treated well.''

SOFT QUESTION FOR MR. MICROSOFT 
SOROS GOES SILENT 
TOWN AND COUNTRY 
KIDS WITH FOUR LEGS
</HEADLINE>
   (mk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was a friendly crowd and a friendly question, but
Bill Gates resisted the temptation to speak too frankly.
</P>
<P>
   Gates, chairman of Microsoft and star witness at the
government's antitrust trial, was addressing a luncheon Wednesday
at the Roosevelt Hotel organized by the Manhattan Institute, a
public-policy group more sympathetic to entrepreneurs than
government attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, one person in the audience raised a question about
the antitrust case: Was it based on a genuine misunderstanding of
the law and the marketplace, or was it class warfare inspired by
jealousy of Gates?
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Gates could give an answer that would fill a nice long
e-mail. But not this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't delve into their mental processes,'' he said, smiling.
``There are many paths to making a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   No Hard Feelings
</P>
<P>
   The financier George Soros is not an unqualified admirer of the
International Monetary Fund, and said so at the New York Public
Library on Tuesday night. ``The IMF system of raising interest
rates in a crisis is rather counterproductive,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   At which point his microphone died.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IMF just turned it off,'' quipped the economist Jeffrey
Madrick, who was moderating the session.
</P>
<P>
   The 550 or so tip-hunting listeners did not find out where Soros
thinks the stock markets will go, but once the public-address
system was revived, he was asked about his famous bet on the
British pound, the one that netted him $1 billion in a single week
in 1992. He called it morally defensible.
</P>
<P>
   The financier Leon Levy went further.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the British had to devalue the pound and lower
interest rates, Levy said: ``George should be honored. They should
make him Lord Soros.''
</P>
<P>
   Reverse Commute
</P>
<P>
   It was camp-reunion time for the Hamptons crowd on Tuesday
night. Artists, filmmakers and writers who seem to have been
spending at least as much time on eastern Long Island as in
Manhattan were sipping cocktails at the Plaza Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know all these people had places to live in the
city,'' said the actor Alan Alda, looking over the black-tie crowd
at the Guild Hall Academy of the Arts awards dinner, an annual
event for the theater-and-museum complex in East Hampton. Alda _
like at least two other guests, Peter Stone and Barry Sonnenfeld _
lives in the Hamptons year round and ventures into Manhattan only
when he has to.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the crowd come and go, but often spend much of the
workweek wishing they could stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being outside New York City tends to leaven people somewhat,''
said the ABC News anchor Peter Jennings, who is himself a Hamptons
homeowner. ``I was talking to Julian Schnabel, who under normal
circumstances is a giant, but under Hamptons circumstances is a
neighbor. It makes a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   A Pet Project
</P>
<P>
   Eartha Kitt arrived with her two miniature poodles, Abba and
Mutzi. They are dogs-about-town: She takes them along when she
performs at the Carlyle Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   But this was a lunch for the Harmony Institute, a nonprofit
group that studies the relationships between people and animals and
was unveiling plans for a ``luxury pet residence'' in Orlando, Fla.
It will have concierges for pets and outdoor doggie showers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have two-legged kids, I have four-legged kids,''
Martha Lentz, the Harmony Institute's chairwoman, said as she
reached for a cigarette after the lunch. ``I try to smoke around my
pets as little as possible, but I'm sure they have the same amount
of lung disease as I do.''

OAKLEY CAN'T SHAKE THE HARD KNOCKS, OR EWING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, N.Y.)  (bl) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The man who has watched Patrick Ewing's back for the
better part of a basketball decade anxiously awaits a bit of news,
a ray of hope, on the prospect of salvaging a season and what was
supposed to be the biggest pay day of a long and dedicated career.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Oakley will not be calling his former New York Knicks
teammate for an update from Thursday's renewed National Basketball
Association labor talks in New York, though.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing is a superstar, and Oakley is not. And the union president
would not want to hear what Oakley might say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talk to Herb Williams,'' Oakley said by telephone from his
mother's home in Cleveland. ``Herb keeps me informed.''
</P>
<P>
   The information to this point has all been bad going on worse, a
season teetering on the edge, with the potential washout of a $10
million thank you from the Knicks to the sturdy power forward they
unceremoniously traded to Toronto last spring.
</P>
<P>
   As if that weren't enough of a kick, Oakley now waits from afar
_ helplessly, as far as he is concerned _ as Ewing, of all people,
leads the superstar-driven hard-line faction in the players' risky
game of high-stakes poker with NBA commissioner David Stern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't make nothing happen,'' Oakley said, with resignation.
``And when you're out in the middle of the ocean, you don't jump in
the water. But I always see where they put the microphones when
they come out of these meetings, only with the franchise players.
They don't let the little man speak. They out to put the
microphones next to the guy who's making $350,000.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the classic, none-too-cryptic Oakley, drawing straight
lines and letting everyone read between them.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the season and his once-in-a-lifetime reward, he was
clearly saying, is in the hands of the autocratic few, who just
happen to be the clients of the leveraged agent, David Falk. Oakley
was saying, then, that this union is not unlike your basic,
locked-out NBA team. Superstars rule.
</P>
<P>
   For much of his 10 seasons in New York, intramural issues
similar to these _ mostly, the preferential treatment for Ewing _
gnawed at Oakley, invariably made him mumble and moan. He was
sensitive, almost to a fault, but he would ultimately rejoin the
cause. He played fiercely for his team, did all the interior dirty
work, and then some.
</P>
<P>
   More than Ewing, the centerpiece, Oakley was called the heart of
the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always did whatever they asked,'' he said. ``Play hurt, play
center. I never told them no.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, the Knicks tacked the $10 million balloon
payment on the end of a contract that last season paid him $2.85
million. Had Toronto played at Charlotte on Wednesday night, as
originally scheduled, Oakley would have earned roughly $122,000. He
will be a free agent after this season, but he will turn 35 in two
weeks. He plays now on battered legs, on gnarled toes. He knows
that even as a free agent, he will not see this kind of contract
again.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone is losing money, he realizes, but his situation is
especially painful. Ewing made big money last year, and will make
big money next year. For Oakley, each passing day, each game lost,
is like running himself through one of the car washes he owns. He
is being hosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can you do?'' he said. ``I try to get up in the morning
every day, and make the best of it. You try to not miss what you
never had. I've never blown a lot of money. And what can I complain
about when there's guys struggling to make 10 to 12 thousand a
year? The people you feel sorry for in this are the ones who are
losing money parking cars and waiting tables in restaurants where
people eat when we play the games.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, in that context, Oakley as a millionaire, needs no
one's pity. That doesn't mean, in an NBA context, his story isn't
one of the sad ironies of the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who can I hold a grudge against?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley knows he can't blame Ewing, who has done nothing personal
to him. He could blame fate, which has never treated him too well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was traded from Chicago, right before they started winning
championships,'' he said, recalling the 1988 deal which sent him to
the Knicks for Bill Cartwright. Had the Bulls given the Knicks
Horace Grant, no doubt Oakley would have won a few rings as the
enforcer for Michael Jordan, as opposed to Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' trading of Oakley for Marcus Camby just before the
lockout began last summer was, to Oakley, the final cold slap in
the face. After all he had meant to the Ewing era, after all the
million spent to upgrade the roster with veteran talent, they just
decided to slog on without him, in their unlikely pursuit of a
title.
</P>
<P>
   The trade, which he said he learned of after its completion,
underscored the feelings he has about what kind of league the NBA
has become.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we're in this situation, `cause you have all these
so-called franchise players who aren't leaders, who don't make
anyone better and don't even make the playoffs,'' Oakley said.
``This league has become all about fake superstars, about hype.''
</P>
<P>
   Not about heart, not about soul. So the man who provided s much
of that for the Knicks for a decade waits for the break of his
professional life. He waits for good news from Williams in New
York. Then maybe the season will start. Then maybe Toronto, which
doesn't an aging enforcer, will trade him to the Los Angeles
Lakers, who do, and he will win his championship ring before Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   It is a delightful thought, a fantasy to hang on to, as Charles
Oakley loses $122,000 a game.

FIRST CRAWL, THEN RUN: POWELL A NATIONAL CROSS-COUNTRY FAVORITE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., N.Y., Ill.)  (bl) 
 By MARC BLOOM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A year ago, Andy Powell of North Easton, Mass., the best young
middle-distance runner in the United States, was brought to his
knees by an identity crisis in the longest race of his life.
</P>
<P>
   It happened on the cross-country trails of Van Cortlandt Park in
the Bronx. Powell, then a junior at Oliver Ames High School, was
already an accomplished miler with a national sophomore indoor
record of 4 minutes 9.82 seconds to his credit. But when he
competed in the Foot Locker Northeast high school regional, Powell
was unproven at the cross-country distance of 5,000 meters. He had
not trained much the previous summer and did not yet have the
stamina to match his speed.
</P>
<P>
   But Powell ran to the limit to try to make the top eight and
qualify for the national championship. Ten meters from the finish,
he held sixth place. But suddenly, Powell fell to his knees and
collapsed. Spectators implored him to get up. Two runners whizzed
by him; two more runners, sensing opportunity, sprinted for the
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I blacked out,'' Powell said. ``Running with the leaders
killed me. My body just stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, with the persistence that would make him one of this
season's national favorites, Powell crawled to the finish and dived
across to nail the eighth and last qualifying spot by inches. The
onrushing runners, unable to avoid the fallen Powell, grazed his
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say to me: `Wow, that was awesome. I can't believe you
did that,''' said Powell, now an 18-year-old senior. ``But for me,
it was more embarrassing than anything else. That's not how I want
to be remembered.''
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 28, Powell replaced that image with one of power and
grace when, undefeated this fall, he returned to Van Cortlandt and
won the Northeast regional by 125 yards in 15:23.2. His victory,
dominating a field of state champions, made him a contender for the
20th annual Foot Locker national meet, Dec. 12, in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to prove I was a cross-country runner,'' Powell said.
``The incident made me train harder. Last summer, I began training
in July and by October was running 70 miles a week.''
</P>
<P>
   The proof was uncontestable. Leading up to the regional, Powell,
bound for Stanford, shattered the 5,000-meter course record at
Franklin Park in Boston. His time was 14:52. The previous record,
15:09, was held by Abdirizak Mohamud, the 1996 and 1997 Foot Locker
national champion.
</P>
<P>
   The Foot Locker event, with fields of 32 boys and 32 girls, is
considered the premier showcase of future American talent. Its
roster of winners includes Olympians like U.S. 5,000-meter
record-holder Bob Kennedy and marathoner Cathy O'Brien. College
coaches swarm over the Orlando race course to follow prize
recruits.
</P>
<P>
   The Northeast also has a strong girls contingent, led by
regional winner Jillian Mastroianni, a junior at Sayville High on
Long Island, and defending national champion Erin Sullivan of Mount
Mansfield, Vt., who was off form at the regional and placed sixth.
They will be challenged by California state champion Sara Bei, a
sophomore who ran 10th last year.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, who finished 20th in the 1997 nationals, is so intent on
the race that he stunned his coach, Paul Carr, last month when he
didn't take advantage of a good excuse to miss practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Saturdays, we run to a hill three miles from school, then
do several repetitions of the hill,'' Carr said. ``Andy had an
early flight that day for a college recruiting visit. He asked me
to hold the practice at 6:30, while it was still dark, so he could
run and still catch his plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell's running prowess was first noticed when he played youth
soccer. Then, in eighth grade, he entered a junior high mile
because the finishers were given donuts. He won in 5:31 but still
preferred playing soccer as well as basketball. His father, a
minister, urged him to concentrate on one pursuit like his older
sister, a music prodigy who played piano.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do the mile,'' his father repeated. ``The mile.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Carr who persuaded Powell to run. But while Powell said
he quickly ``fell in love'' with the mile for its speed and
glamour, he maintains a reckless streak that belies his maturity.
He still plays pickup basketball. He goes water skiing. He does
flips on a backyard trampoline. Last summer, he hurt his hip
bouncing around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's dumb, but I like that kind of thing,'' said
Powell, who is 5 feet 10 inches and 137 pounds. ``Someone once told
me, if you just run, you'll drive yourself crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell's link to basketball has given him a connection to his
leading opposition in the nationals _ Jorge and Ed Torres, twins
from Wheeling High in the Chicago area. Jorge, the midwest regional
winner and the only boy to make the nationals all four years,
placed second in Orlando last year. Ed placed sixth and has also
qualified again.
</P>
<P>
   Powell previously lived in the Chicago suburb of Lake Zurich,
where, in seventh grade, he played in a basketball league against a
team featuring the Torres brothers. All three youngsters were point
guards who were matched against one another on the court.
</P>
<P>
   Last year in Orlando, the boys reminisced and since then Powell
has called the Torres twins on occasion just to say hello. Jorge is
considered a strong hill runner, but since the nationals' terrain
is flat, Powell's speed is a potent weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a miler's course,'' said Powell, who has run the 400
meters in 50.9 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Last track season, without his recently acquired endurance,
Powell ran the fastest high school 1,500 meters in the country,
3:47.37, which equates to a 4:05 mile. He won the national indoor
mile in 4:07.34, a junior class record, as well as the two-mile
event. His best two-mile race, an 8:59.19 indoors, was also the
fastest in the country in 1998. This spring he hopes to become the
first high school runner in 32 years to run under 4 minutes in the
mile.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, a newcomer, Franklyn Sanchez of nearby Lynn Tech in
Massachusetts, rose to challenge him. But instead of digging in his
heels, Powell nurtured Sanchez, a senior but still 16 and unsure of
his talent. They ran together in their state meet as Powell
triumphed with precision by one second, leading Ames to the
Division II team title.
</P>
<P>
   And, at Powell's suggestion, they ran together at the regional
until Powell surged ahead near the finish. Sanchez, originally from
the Dominican Republic, where he lived on his grandmother's farm
and milked cows before school, placed second. ``Andy tells me,
`Let's work together,''' Sanchez said. ``He's helped me get to the
nationals.''
</P>
<P>
   Their friendship began last summer when the two boys trained
together at Walden Pond, running as far as 15 miles, and Sanchez
took Powell out for a Dominican meal of chicken and rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still owe him,'' Powell said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a payback meal, Sanchez would like to have Powell at
his side in the nationals. ``That's my goal,'' Sanchez said. ``To
hang with Andy.''
</P>
<P>
   That will be every runner's goal, but now that the miler has
become a distance runner, too, there may be no catching Powell. As
long as he can stay off the trampoline.  &QL;

ODOM GUIDES RHODE ISLAND TO AN UPSET
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ He took the long way to Rhode Island from Christ the
King High School in Queens. There were stops at Connecticut and
upstate New York at prep schools in his senior year, followed by a
summer in Las Vegas, where he was presumably going to join the
Runnin' Rebels. Lamar Odom is probably the most well-traveled
freshman in college basketball, and the road has always been bumpy.
</P>
<P>
   He was implicated in a college entrance exam cheating scandal
that prompted Nevada-Las Vegas to rescind its scholarship offer. He
apparently passed a full load at Rhode Island last year as a
full-time student, but he was entered in last spring's National
Basketball Association draft until the National Collegiate Athletic
Association cleared him to play this season.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he is the antithesis of Utah's point guard,
Andre Miller, who was academically ineligible to play at the start
of his Ute career, but hit the books hard enough to graduate with a
sociology/criminology major last spring and decided to pass up the
NBA to take graduate courses as well as to take advantage of his
fourth year of eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   Still, what was apparent as the two dueled Wednesday night in
the Great Eight at the United Center is that both are splendid
players no matter what their personal histories. It was Odom and a
balanced Rhode Island attack, however, that prevailed, 70-63, over
No. 21 Utah in the first game of a doubleheader.
</P>
<P>
   The grace with which Odom loped downcourt and sliced leading
bounce passes to his teammates belied his 6-foot-10-inch, 220-pound
frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's incredibly fluid,'' Miller said of Odom. ``I didn't know
much about him coming in, but he's as good as I've seen. He's going
to get a lot better, too.''
</P>
<P>
   But Miller won the duel of statistics with 28 points, 4 assists
and 6 steals.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how circuitous his travels, Odom demonstrated that he
is most at home on the basketball court running a team. He finished
with 15 points, but that didn't begin to measure how he controlled
a contest that pitted Rhode Island's raw athleticism against Utah's
cerebral passing game.
</P>
<P>
   His six assists kept his teammates slashing to the basket and
looking for the ball as four Rams scored in double figures _ led by
Antonio Reynolds-Dean with 22 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew coming in that they may be double-teaming Lamar,''
said Reynolds-Dean, a muscular 6-7 forward. ``I knew that would
mean more chances for me. I hit two shots early, and that's all I
needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Odom hit a three-pointer with a little more than 10 minutes left
in the game to put the Rams up by 50-46. That sparked Rhode
Island's 14-6 run to grab control of the game. Rhode Island shot 52
percent to become the first team this season to fire better than 40
percent against the defense-minded Utes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a a very good win for us and one we needed badly,''
said Rhode Island Coach Jim Harrick, whose team improved to 4-3
after tough losses to Providence, Cincinnati and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   For Utah, the 6-2 Miller never gave up. His hands whirled as
quickly as his feet scooted from baseline to baseline with the ball
in perpetual motion as he tried to keep Utah close. Only one other
player, Hanno Mottola, finished in double figures (13 points) as
Utah shot just 38.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not looking to be aggressive enough,'' said Utah Coach
Rick Majerus, whose team is now 3-3. ``I've got them uptight on
offense.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   If Rhode Island, which lost its backcourt of Cuttino Mobley and
Tyson Wheeler to the NBA, is to return to the NCAA tournament's
Round of 8 or beyond, it is up to Odom.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he matures more physically and mentally, we'll run our
offense through him like Utah does Miller,'' Harrick said. ``He's
the guy who can take us there.''
</P>
<P>
   But Odom knows he has more to prove off the court. He is bright,
perceptive and finally humbled. ``I made some bad choices,'' he
said of his nearly two years of basketball travels. ``I admit them.
Now it's time to persevere. I'm glad I made my mistakes now instead
of when I'm older with more to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Heading to their locker rooms, Miller and Odom crossed paths and
hugged. The newcomer thanked the player of the year candidate for a
lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``You showed me a lot of things I could use,'' Odom told Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Miller smiled and said, ``It was fun.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Utah guard walked away, Odom said he didn't know Miller
well. ``But you can tell by his smile and the way he handles
himself he's a good person,'' Odom said. ``I want people to say
that about me someday. I've got a long way to go. But I'm trying.''

 GIULIANI GARBAGE PLAN MARRED BY POLITICAL GAFFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also NY-WASTE-JERSEY) 
(mk) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN and DAN BARRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani triumphantly unveiled a
proposal Wednesday to ship most of the city's residential garbage
to transfer stations in New Jersey, but the administration's glee
was quickly muted by an embarrassing lapse in political tact: It
did not tell New Jersey of the plan until Wednesday morning, and
then only in sketchy detail.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time that Giuliani was proudly discussing how his
administration had possibly resolved one of the city's most vexing
problems _ the future disposal of its millions of tons of trash _
New Jersey's governor, Christie Whitman, was issuing a news release
that included the headline ``Whitman to New York's Garbage Plan:
Drop Dead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposal being promoted by the City of New York is a
direct assault on the beaches of New Jersey and a very real threat
to our quality of life, especially to the residents of Hudson,
Union, Essex and Middlesex Counties,'' Whitman said. She added that
she would do everything in her power to block any plan that might
harm the state's environment.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high for New York City, which must find an
alternative to dumping its trash at the largest landfill in the
world, Fresh Kills in Staten Island. But Fresh Kills is scheduled
to close by the end of 2001, and Giuliani expressed fears that
federal environmental authorities could shut it down at any time,
creating an immediate crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Under the city's plan, it would send nearly 5,900 tons of
Manhattan and Queens garbage to transfer stations to be built by
private contractors in Newark and Carteret, N.J. In addition, a
transfer station would be built at the Port of Red Hook in Brooklyn
to handle that borough's 3,900 tons of daily trash. Then, after
being compacted in air-tight containers at these transfer stations,
the garbage would be shipped to privately owned landfills in
Virginia, Pennsylvania and other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``This plan is a very fair one and a very equitable one,'' the
mayor said. But by Wednesday night, other New Jersey officials had
joined the ``drop dead'' chorus, placing Giuliani's deputy mayor
for operations, Joseph Lhota, in the delicate position of defending
the plan as environmentally sound but apologizing for its delivery.
Lhota had informed an aide to Mrs. Whitman of the city's plans just
hours before the mayor's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our fault, and not Gov. Whitman's, that she did not
understand New York City's environmentally sound plan for long-term
solid waste management,'' Lhota said in a statement. ``The Governor
and her staff were not adequately briefed in a complete manner.''
</P>
<P>
   In a brief interview Wednesday night, Lhota said his statement
was one of contrition. ``No one likes to be surprised, and in this
case, the governor was surprised,'' he said. ``It's my job to make
the governor fully apprised.''
</P>
<P>
   The sensitivity of the matter goes beyond the traditional
rivalry between New York and New Jersey. Although they are both
moderate Republicans, Giuliani and Whitman have quarreled in the
past over several issues, from the rights to Ellis Island to the
management of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. And
recent history made the city's plan sting all the more: The
complaints of Mrs. Whitman in early 1997 forced Giuliani and New
York Gov. George Pataki to postpone a city plan to dump 560 million
gallons of raw sewage into New York Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference, Giuliani and his aides had engaged in a
little New Jersey humor while detailing where the city's garbage
would go. ``Does any go to the Meadowlands?'' the mayor joked. When
told no, he said: ``Too bad. Well, we ought to get even, right? I
mean for the Giants and the Jets.'' The two professional football
teams left New York to play in the Meadowlands in New Jersey years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the New Jersey jokes had ended by evening as state, county
and local officials in New Jersey criticized the plan. ``We will
not be the dumping ground for any entity,'' Mayor Sharpe James of
Newark said, ``especially since their plans call for bringing this
solid waste to a site that is near an area that is undergoing
extensive revitalization.''
</P>
<P>
   Governor Whitman and her aides said their principal worry was
that garbage might spill from the city barges on the way to the
transfer stations in New Jersey, causing pollution of her state's
beaches. She characterized the garbage shipping as ``an
environmental disaster waiting to happen.''

OPPOSITION SEEN FOR GIULIANI PLAN TO SEND GARBAGE TO N.J. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (With NY-WASTE) (mk) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's proposal
to ship tons of New York City's garbage through New Jersey each day
could not be implemented without county and state approval and
faces stiff opposition at both levels, officials in Trenton and in
Essex and Middlesex Counties said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement in New York that the city intended send nearly
5,900 tons of garbage to transfer stations to be built in Newark,
which is in Essex County, and Carteret, which is in Middlesex,
elicited a range of reactions from tepid skepticism to eruptions of
fury Wednesday in New Jersey. Giuliani did not tell officials here
of his plan until Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman, in a statement issued Wednesday
afternoon, said, ``The sites in Middlesex and Essex Counties would
require amendments to the solid waste plans for both counties,
which must also be approved by the county boards of freeholders and
ultimately by the state.'' The statement added, ``All of these
processes require public hearings and input from members of the
affected communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, each of New Jersey's 21 counties has a solid
waste advisory council, which is responsible for developing a
county solid waste management plan. The plans include specific
criteria for how trash is transported and disposed of throughout a
county, including the traffic routes that garbage trucks can use
and limits on the amount of trash that can be burned by an
incinerator or dumped in a landfill. Changes must be approved by
the county's freeholders and the state, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In Middlesex County, where Giuliani's plan calls for the
construction in Carteret of a transfer station where barges would
unload nearly 4,000 tons of garbage a day from Queens and
Manhattan, the director of the board of freeholders, David Crabiel,
reacted venomously and pledged to fight it. ``It's the most
ludicrous proposal I have ever heard,'' Crabiel said. ``It will
never happen in Middlesex County.''
</P>
<P>
   Crabiel noted that Middlesex had fought successfully in the
1980s to stop other counties from dumping their garbage there. ``We
are not going to let in any out-of-state or any out-of-county
garbage,'' he said. Of Giuliani, he said, ``Let him barge it up the
Hudson and take his garbage to Albany.''
</P>
<P>
   Crabiel predicted that the county's solid waste advisory
committee and the other freeholders would agree. ``I am sure both
groups would vote unanimously no,'' Crabiel said.
</P>
<P>
   William Abele, executive director of the Essex County Utility
Authority, said Giuliani's plan would need county and state
approval because it involved constructing the transfer station.
``The county and the state have approval powers over the
development of any transfer station, regardless of the source of
the trash that it handles,'' he said. ``I can't imagine any
circumstances where this authority would approve a new transfer
station if that would cause any environmental or economic harm to
Essex County.''

MARY BENJAMIN, 93, DEALER IN DOCUMENTS OF THE FAMOUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mary Benjamin, an autograph dealer with such an authoritative
eye for authenticity and such a sure sense of value that for
decades she virtually dictated prices American collectors paid for
the writings of presidents, poets and other prominent people, died
Nov. 30 at her home in Hunter, N.Y. She was 93 and had been so
widely recognized as the nation's leading document authority that
she regularly received mail addressed simply to ``The Autograph
Lady.''
</P>
<P>
   As a daughter of Walter R. Benjamin, a onetime New York Sun
reporter who founded what is now the nation's oldest autograph
dealership in Manhattan in 1887, Miss Benjamin, a native of
Yonkers, N.Y., who graduated from Barnard, did not so much inherit
her expertise as absorb it by osmosis during a 13-year
apprenticeship at her father's elbow.
</P>
<P>
   By the time she took over Walter R. Benjamin Autographs in 1940,
Miss Benjamin had become so familiar with the handwritings of
presidents, cabinet secretaries, signers of the Declaration of
Independence, Civil War generals and American and European
composers, literary figures and the like that she could often tell
at a glance not only if a document was authentic but which master
forger had produced it if it was not.
</P>
<P>
   Her expertise was so respected that once, when an auctioneer at
a leading Manhattan gallery announced to the assembled bidders that
the next item would be a George Washington letter, an audible snort
of derision from Miss Benjamin was enough to cause the auctioneer
to withdraw from the sale on the spot. As her snort had indicated,
she had gotten a quick look at the letter moments earlier and
recognized it as a forgery.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when there were only a handful of dealers who handled
autographs _ a term, meaning ``self-writing,'' that applies to
anything, not simply the signature, written in a person's own hand
_ Miss Benjamin's standing tended to overshadow her role as the
only woman in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Because of her reputation, experienced collectors and those with
trunks full of old papers tended to seek her out, but Miss Benjamin
was never satisfied with walk-in trade.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to tracking down valuable documents, she was very
much the daughter of the man who catapulted himself into the first
ranks of his field in 1907. Learning that the Customs Service had
sold 140 tons of old documents to a junk dealer, he persuaded the
man to let him go through the refuse and ended up paying 25 cents
each for thousands of documents signed by Presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, when Miss Benjamin learned that the publishers of
``The Dictionary of American Biography'' had cleaned out its files
of questionnaires filled out by 25,000 prominent Americans over two
decades, she tracked down the junk dealer in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., who
had picked them up and ended up acquiring hundreds of them,
including three separate intimate questionnaires that had been
filled out by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a photographic memory that allowed her to recognize a
handwriting she had not seen in years and to rattle off obscure
biographic details of more than 10,000 notable figures of the
previous 500 years, Miss Benjamin, who bought and sold between
5,000 and 10,000 documents a year and maintained an inventory of
some 50,000 documents in her office vaults, had an uncanny sense of
their value in the market of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   A woman whose passions could be inflamed by a surprise
discovery, Miss Benjamin, a crack bridge player, once likened the
thrill of opening a trunk of old letters to the feeling of
anticipation she felt at picking up a hand at the bridge table.
</P>
<P>
   In her 40s when she married Harold G. Henderson, a Columbia
professor of Japanese art who had served on General Douglas
MacArthur's staff and composed Emperor Hirohito's renunciation of
divinity, Miss Benjamin soon drew her husband into her scholarly
detective work. On weekends the couple, wearing kimonos, would sit
in the backyard of their Manhattan town house reading old
manuscripts.
</P>
<P>
   They also became famous for dinner parties whose regular guests
included the likes of Georgia O'Keeffe.
</P>
<P>
   A boom in autograph collecting in the 1960s brought her more
competition, but Miss Benjamin, whose oft-revised 1946 book,
``Autographs: A Key to Collecting,'' has been regarded as a
standard in the field, remained a figure to be reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
   After her husband's death, she moved her business to Hunter,
about 40 miles southeast of Albany, in 1974 and continued to be
active until 1995. It is now operated by her nephew Christopher
Jaeckel, who became her assistant in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Jaeckel, Miss Benjamin is survived by a sister,
Yolanda Jaeckel of Cranbury, N.J.; another nephew, Theodore Jaeckel
of Princeton Junction, N.J., and a niece, Pamela Oppen of Hunter.

STOW THE MOWER: GIANTS STADIUM GRASS FIELD DELAYED 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Officials for the Giants, the Jets, the MetroStars and the New
Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority decided Wednesday to
postpone the installation of a permanent grass field at Giants
Stadium until 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Giants and MetroStars officials came to the meeting prepared to
support a grass field for the 1999 season, while Jets officials
were more skeptical. Jets coach Bill Parcells on Monday had
criticized the temporary grass field installed last summer for
being a little soft and said, ``I don't want to be involved in any
experiment here.''
</P>
<P>
   A vote on the issue was never taken because Scott Clark, the
president of Clark Cos., which would install the field using trays
of grass, indicated that the best solution might be to wait another
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott Clark said he could give us an acceptable field that
would work,'' said John Mara, the Giants' vice president and senior
counsel. ``But he recommended waiting so more things could be
studied.
</P>
<P>
   ``From that point on, everybody knew we had to wait, but I
wanted to be sure we weren't postponing this every year. We want
the grass in 2000, and we were told the best technology would be
ready by then.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark said Parcells' comments Monday did not directly influence
his presentation at the meeting. ``I didn't think what he said was
way out in left field,'' he said. ``This is a prominent place in
American sports, and we can't have one ounce of failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Giants coach Jim Fassel, who has supported the installation of a
grass field, said he was not disappointed by the decision to delay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the reasoning,'' Fassel said. ``My understanding is
that Scott Clark said if you wait a year, this field will be really
special. But this year might have been pushing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Financing the grass field, which could cost as much as $4
million was not discussed at Wednesday's two-hour meeting. It would
probably be split up among the parties involved. New Jersey and the
teams will begin financing the installation and testing of a
permanent grass field at the facility, which is the only stadium
that is home to two National Football League teams.
</P>
<P>
   Work will begin early next year on the modular warning-track
system, made of a red rubber compound, that will surround the more
than 6,400 grass trays that will make up the field. The track will
extend to the bench areas and allow vehicles to move inside the
stadium without driving on the grass.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the design and engineering of the environment control
system that will cool and humidify the grass field, and for
example, melt snow that settles on it, will be completed and
tested.
</P>
<P>
   And, perhaps most important, a system called GrassMaster will be
tested as a way to strengthen the durability of Clark's tray field.
GrassMaster is a European system that implants polypropylene fibers
seven inches deep into a grass field. There would be 12 fibers per
foot of field; they are meant to substantially extend the playable
hours of a natural grass field.
</P>
<P>
   Even Though it has been used at European athletic sites, the
first GrassMaster system field in the United States is being
installed by Clark Cos. in Binghamton, N.Y., for use by the Mets'
minor league affiliate there.
</P>
<P>
   GrassMaster, however, has not been tried on a tray field. Clark
said his plastic trays would have to be placed on a conveyor that
passed beneath a fiber stitching machine.
</P>
<P>
   Giants Stadium will have a temporary grass-tray field again next
summer, with the MetroStars playing most of their games on it. The
Giants and Jets will play all their preseason games on the grass;
the Kickoff Classic will be played on the turf, too. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The grass trays will then be removed for the Giants and Jets
1999 regular seasons. In early 2000, the plan calls for work to
begin to lay down a permanent grass field. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're aiming at the best grass field we can,'' said Jets
President Steve Gutman, who attended Wednesday's meeting. ``Our
objective is by 2,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Most pleased by Wednesday's developments seemed to be Charlie
Stillitano, general manager of the MetroStars.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, everyone walked out believing that grass
is the future at Giants Stadium,'' he said. ``It's a real,
unequivocal commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides playing host to 20 Giants and Jets preseason and regular
season games, Giants Stadium also is the site for about six other
college and high school football games a year and 45 other events
ranging from rock concerts to marching band competitions.

3 ACCUSED OF CHEATING INVESTORS IN FLORIDA RECYCLING COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Fla.)  (bl) 
 By ANTHONY RAMIREZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three people who were promoting the stock of a
Florida company that recycled toxic waste were indicted Wednesday
on charges that they cheated 200 investors, including more than 50
New York state court officers and their friends and families, out
of more than $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the investors' money, which has not yet been recovered,
went directly into the private bank accounts of the three suspects,
instead of for the purchase of stock, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The three suspects, Edward Halloran, Michele Caridi and Richard
Furman, and the company, Inorganic Recycling Corp. of Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., were indicted by a grand jury on 24 counts,
including 11 counts of grand larceny, said Manhattan District
Attorney Robert Morgenthau.
</P>
<P>
   Halloran, 57, and Ms. Caridi, 37, are married, and Morgenthau
said they misled investors by failing to disclose that Halloran,
and not Ms. Caridi, was the largest shareholder in Inorganic
Recycling, and by failing to disclose that Halloran had been
convicted of racketeering in federal court in 1996 and a fraud
scheme in a New York state court in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Halloran is a fugitive from justice, Morgenthau said, and Ms.
Caridi has been released on her own recognizance, pending the
posting of a $1 million bond.
</P>
<P>
   The investors included many state court employees and their
relatives and were recruited by Furman, Morgenthau said. Furman, a
court sergeant who supervises officers in charge of security for
the New York state Supreme Court, is also free on his own
recognizance. He is charged with encouraging other court employees
to invest in Inorganic Recycling, although it is not listed on
public stock exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Carolyn Pelling said the promoters
of Inorganic Recycling promised potential investors returns of 3 to
12 times their initial investments in just a few months. Many of
the investors, including the state court employees, had moderate
annual incomes of $30,000 to $50,000. The largest individual sum
lost was $60,000 belonging to Richard Grimm, a friend of Furman and
a fellow court security officer, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Furman, 48, must have known Halloran's record and the fraudulent
nature of the Inorganic Recycling investment scheme, the
authorities said, because as a court sergeant he attended
Halloran's fraud trial in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Reached Wednesday night at his home in Flushing, Queens, Furman
declined to comment. To remain free, the district attorney's office
said, he must surrender his ability to collect his state court
pension, totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Halloran, Ms. Caridi and other investors took control
of 51 percent of the stock of Inorganic Recycling, a company that
was on the verge of a bankruptcy but had a promising patented
process for converting poisonous steel waste into nontoxic
byproducts, Ms. Pelling said. But they did nothing to find working
capital for the struggling company; instead, the money went for a
lush Florida life style, Ms. Pelling said, and the company filed
for bankruptcy in Broward County earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Edward W. Hayes, 51, Ms. Caridi's lawyer, said, ``She's got
terrible taste in husbands and that's all of her problem right
there.'' He added: ``She never sold anybody to anything. She never
met any of these people,'' referring to the Inorganic Recycling
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes said his client first met Halloran as a teen-ager, when
she was a baby sitter for his family, and later married him. They
are now separated and in divorce proceedings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So first she's a baby sitter, then she's a wife, and the next
thing she knows she's indicted,'' he said.

TEXAS CHRISTIAN IN BOWL PICTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Think TCU playing in a bowl game on New
Year's Eve sounds crazy? Well, don't. It could happen.
</P>
<P>
   TCU officials plan to travel to El Paso today to meet with
officials from the Sun Bowl to talk about the possibility of the
Horned Frogs filling an at-large slot to play Southern Cal.
</P>
<P>
   Bowl bids will officially be extended Sunday, and TCU, a team
that went 1-10 in 1997 and finished fifth in the Mountain Division
this season, could be among the recipients.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are one of the teams we are considering,'' said John
Folmer, the chairman of the Sun Bowl selection committee. ``It's a
long shot. A lot of things need to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, one really big domino needs to fall.
</P>
<P>
   For TCU (6-5) to be considered, Ohio State needs to be selected
as one of the two at-large teams for one of the four Bowl
Championship Series games.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State (10-1) is ranked fifth in the BCS rankings.
</P>
<P>
   If no upsets happen in Saturday's games, the BCS's four bowls
could look like this: Fiesta _ Tennessee vs. UCLA; Rose _ Arizona
vs. Wisconsin; Sugar _ Kansas State vs. Ohio State; and Orange _
Syracuse vs. Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   If Ohio State goes to one of the four BCS bowls, the Big Ten
would have four remaining bowl-eligible teams. To be bowl eligible,
teams need to have six victories against Division I-A teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Bowl has contracts with the Big Ten and Pacific-10, and
is supposed to feature the No. 4 team in the PAC-10 against the No.
5 team in the Big Ten, Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   But if Ohio State goes to a BCS bowl, that opens another bowl
slot for a Big Ten team. Purdue would go to the Alamo Bowl, and the
Sun Bowl would get the team with the next best record in the Big
Ten.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State (6-6) is the Big Ten's next team in line, but
NCAA rules say if a team plays 12 games, it has to win seven of
those to be bowl eligible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand that certain things have to happen, but just to
be sitting here on Dec. 2 in this position is pretty neat,'' Horned
Frogs coach Dennis Franchione said. ``We'll just hope for a little
luck.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Big Ten is unable to fulfill its contract to the Sun
Bowl, Folmer said the bowl would then look at the remaining
eligible teams to fill the slot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The list is rather short,'' Folmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Folmer said some of the teams that are being considered are
Central Florida (9-2), Miami, Ohio (10-1) and three Western
Athletic Conference teams _ Colorado State (8-4), Utah (7-4) and
Wyoming (8-4).
</P>
<P>
   Colorado State and Wyoming both defeated TCU this season. They
are also schools that announced plans this spring to leave the WAC
to form the Mountain West.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Bowl is on the campus of Texas-El Paso, one of the eight
remaining WAC schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already gotten calls from fans in Wyoming saying: `Why
won't they take us. We beat TCU?' '' Folmer said. ``There are more
people in the city of Fort Worth than the state of Wyoming. . . .
Besides, TCU has had an exciting season. They won one game last
year, and this season's turnaround under Dennis Franchione is
exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU last went to a bowl in 1994, a 20-10 loss to Virginia in the
Independence Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   After 1997's 1-10 season, former coach Pat Sullivan resigned,
Franchione was brought in and the Frogs went 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I've exceeded my wildest expectations by far,''
Franchione said. ``It brings a big smile to your face. It's great
for the university, great for the kids just to be in this
position.''

HMOs TO GRANT OUTSIDE REVIEWS 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ California's biggest HMOs said Wednesday that they
will voluntarily give their customers access to an independent,
third-party review if they are denied treatment by the health plan.
</P>
<P>
   The move follows the adoption of similar programs at a handful
of HMOs around the country and at plans in 18 states where some
form of external review is mandated by law.
</P>
<P>
   Currently in California, most health plans must provide outside
review only when a member is treated through a federal program such
as Medicare, when the dispute is over an experimental treatment or
when a person's life is in danger.
</P>
<P>
   Under the guidelines proposed by the California Association of
Health Plans and agreed to by its 16 biggest members, patients who
are denied treatment can appeal to an independent health care
professional or body that is selected by the HMO. A patient would
have to exhaust the HMO's internal appeals process first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patients should not have to fear that they might be denied
care they need,'' said Walter Zelman, CAHP's president. ``Their
health comes first.''
</P>
<P>
   The 16 CAHP member plans that have signed on to the proposal
account for about 90 percent of the state's managed care enrollees,
and the organization said it expects smaller members to follow
suit. But because bills mandating independent review are likely to
find their way to the state Legislature this year, most plans are
expected to wait until the end of 1999 to implement the service.
</P>
<P>
   While the CAHP initiative was generally well met Wednesday,
consumer advocates said it is only one step in the right direction.
A better solution, they argue, is to define and mandate external
review through law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state Legislature is a better way to go,'' said Geraldine
Dallek, a researcher at the Georgetown Institute of Healthcare
Research and Policy. ``One, it's mandatory. Two, it's clearly
binding. And three, you know it really is external.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallek said it's also cheaper: A Georgetown study found that the
average cost to health plans ranged from roughly a half-cent to
4cents per patient per month in states where external review is
required.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates also say that when implemented on a voluntary
basis, the outside reviewers hired by a health plan might be prone
to rule in the HMO's favor. Peter Lee, an attorney with the Los
Angeles-based Center for Healthcare Rights, described the CAHP
proposal as ``a nice baby step,'' but said state legislation would
ensure standardization.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, participating health plans say that while they
have previously sponsored external review legislation, a market
approach can be effective and consistent. ``I don't believe you'll
actually see 16 different systems,'' said Ron Williams, president
of Blue Cross of California. ``Health plans all do have today
external review processes in place for life threatening (issues)
and will likely just build on that.''
</P>
<P>
   And nationally there is no rush among managed care companies to
create federal external review legislation. Susan Pisano, a
spokeswoman for the American Association of Health Plans, said such
laws might one day be appropriate but not now.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be a great deal of care exercised in how this
is done. There should be discussions about it ... but private
sector initiatives are better at addressing most questions,'' she
said.

FEDERAL TASK FORCE WORKING TO AID LAID-OFF BOEING WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON and BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Boeing confirmed Wednesday that the deepening job
cuts it unveiled Tuesday would hit Puget Sound hardest.
</P>
<P>
   And President Clinton, saying he was ``very concerned,''
promised to send money and ``rapid response teams'' to coordinate
benefits and retraining for laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing Chairman Phil Condit, addressing for the first time the
labor impacts of production cuts his company announced Tuesday,
said in a press conference that 80 to 90 percent of the jobs would
be cut from Boeing Commercial Airplanes, the division of the
company that makes passenger jets at Everett, Renton and Wichita,
Kan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will fall most heavily on Puget Sound,'' he said. Cuts will
come across the board, including the design staff, which has no new
airplane to work on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're downsizing the whole production system,'' said Alan
Mulally, president of Boeing Commercial Airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street, which often responds positively when a company
trims its workforce, instead hammered the aerospace company's stock
down 17 percent, pulverizing about $7 billion in investor net
worth. The stock fell $6.69, closing at $33.69 _ not far from its
12-month low of $29.50, and miles from its high of $56.25. Boeing
led the stock market down, 69 points on the Dow Industrials.
Trading more than 36.7 million shares, about 12 times the norm, it
was the most active stock in the markets.
</P>
<P>
   Stock analysts, who had lined up as six ``strong buys,'' six
``buys'' and five ``holds'' on Boeing stock before the company's
projections Tuesday, nervously reshuffled their chairs, and ended
the day with one ``strong buy,'' 12 ``holds'' and one ``sell.''
``Analysts have thrown in the towel on this one,'' said Chuck Hill,
director of research at Boston-based First Call.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs, however, were the wider concern in western Washington
state.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's employment peaked in June at 238,000. The company said
Tuesday that by the end of 1999 it expects to cut as many as 38,000
jobs from that peak, and by the end of 2000, to cut 10,000 more.
Some 5,400 of the cuts have already been made.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Department of Labor has already begun work with Boeing ...
and we will continue to work closely with them,'' White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart said during Wednesday's news briefing.
``Basically, the rapid response teams work with company and state
officials and affected employees to coordinate immediate job
placement assistance and financial assistance to workers. And I'm
told that that process is already under way, even before the
announcement.''
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department has faced similar situations. An official
here who asked not to be identified said her agency had developed
rapid response teams and sent them to begin working with
Washington, Kansas and California several months ago when the
prospect of layoffs became likely at Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working with the company to get information to workers
about job placement, job retraining, financial assistance _
whatever we have within our disposal _ and there's a team of
people, some from the federal government, working closely with the
company and the unions to make this real,'' the official said.
``There will also be special funds made available to the states to
be used for retraining and job placement assistance and
counselors.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told reporters that the Boeing layoffs demonstrate the
importance of U.S. efforts to end the Asian financial crisis. He
noted that Asian nations could not buy U.S. airplanes if their
economies were in crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's why I have given such a high priority for the
better part of a year now ... to trying to stabilize the situation
there, limit the spread of the financial contagion, and then
reverse conditions in Asia and restore economic growth there.''
</P>
<P>
   When that happens, he said, ``they'll start buying the airplanes
again, production lines will start up again, and they'll call the
workers back.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing officials, while not saying anything to contradict this,
painted a somber picture of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation in Asia has worsened dramatically,'' said
Condit. ``It is much deeper and more prolonged than first
estimated.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing President Harry Stonecipher, who recently returned from a
trip to Asia, was asked how long the Asian recession would last.
``Almost every time you ask them, it's `one to two years.' Next
year it'll probably still be, `one to two years.' We think it's
three to five; we hope it's three.''
</P>

   Stonecipher said the Asian crisis had also affected the prospect
of AWACS and F-18 military sales to South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The two executives fielded questions that suggested that they
had underestimated the Asian crisis and now were overreacting to
it.
</P>
<P>
   Condit admitted underestimating it. ``This is a business that
changes with economic conditions,'' he said. ``If you could predict
economic conditions perfectly, you could make a lot of money in a
lot of places. We're trying to follow our market.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the charge of overreacting, Stonecipher said, ``We're not
going to do anything stupid about this. We're going to go about it
in a very methodical way, a very careful way.''
</P>
<P>
   Condit stressed that the company's new forecast for 2000, which
was so gloomy, could be wrong. ``If things get better, there is
still some upside potential. This is our best estimate based on all
the data we have right now,'' he said. And if economies worsened in
North America and Europe, he said, cuts could be greater, and
center on programs other than the 747.
</P>
<P>
   Only 84 of the 620 airplanes slated to be built next year are
for Asian carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Stonecipher said the layoffs also reflect several years of
unmanaged hiring, in which ``things got out of control.'' He said
the company, despite its success in getting back on schedule, is
spending 20 to 30 percent more hours to assemble an airplane than
it did in 1992 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials said they are not convinced this is a rational
exercise in productivity enhancement. Said Charles Bofferding,
president of the Seattle Professional Engineering Employees
Association, ``Is this really a reaction to the work to be done, or
is it an attempt to appease Wall Street and reduce short-term
costs?''
</P>
<P>
   Bofferding said he thought part of it relates to last year's
merger of Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. ``We get a little sloppy in
our thinking when we say this is production stuff,'' he said. ``A
lot of it is merger stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   But as for the cuts, said Bofferding, ``If the company really
wants to reduce the numbers, we can't stop them, so we're doing
everything possible to mitigate the impact.''
</P>
<P>
   He said SPEEA is focusing efforts on setting up a job fair next
year to introduce members to other employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a pretty tight labor market for high-tech
employees,'' he said. ``Our goal is to let the people who go out
the door be people who choose to go out the door.''
</P>
<P>
   The other, larger union of Boeing employees, the Aerospace
Machinists, was less accepting, and angrier.
</P>
<P>
   Condit said that all the unions had been notified of Tuesday's
announcement, but Aerospace Machinist Local 751 President Bill
Johnson said he had learned about it when called by reporters.
</P>
<P>
   And he was fit to be tied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I checked with every union leader who would be affected by
this announcement, and no one, not one person, had been told of
this announcement in advance,'' he said in a prepared statement
released Wednesday night. ``We cannot sit by while Boeing callously
chooses what information it shares with us and when, and then lies
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson made the statement after what the union called ``a
heated three-hour meeting'' with management. The union said he was
willing for the Boeing/Machinists Working Group to meet again,
``but with a clear understanding that whatever happens will
directly impact upcoming negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   One place of agreement was the federal help. State officials,
the unions and Boeing all welcomed it.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Gallwas, assistant commissioner of the state Department of
Employment Security, said the federal government played a role in
helping the state cope with the last round of Boeing layoffs, in
the early '90s, and that federal money might be needed to help pay
for tuition, books, and other support for workers in retraining.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government has been extremely helpful, very
responsive, and I expect that support to continue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing and its major union agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will use all the assistance that we can to get our people
situated so that they can be gainfully employed and have good
jobs,'' said Boeing spokesman Larry McCracken.
</P>
<P>
   And Machinists spokeswoman Karen Waters said ``anything to help
in this situation is welcomed.''
