<HEADLINE> EU Pledges Long-term Ties with Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Chris Patten, the Governor of Hong
Kong, is holding a full day of talks here with the European
Commission(EC), as part of the process of developing long-term
ties between the European Union(EU) and the territory.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, which began yesterday afternoon and ends this
evening, he has met EC President Jacques Santer, Vice-President
Sir Leon Brittan and Manuel Marin and Commissioner Anita Gradin
and Mario Monti.
</P>
<P>
According to Sir Leon's spokesman Guilford, key themes of the
talks include Hong Kong's central position in the EU's policy of
closer relations with Asia, the options for practical cooperation
between Hong Kong and the EU in the public and private sector, and
the concern that Hong Kong passport-holders should enjoy visa-free
access to EU member states.
</P>
<P>
Mr Guilford told reporters that progress towards Hong Kong's
transfer of sovereignty in 1997 was also discussed in detail.
</P>
<P>
President Jacques Santer and Governor Chris Patten have given a
warm welcome to the recent recognition by the EU Council of
Ministers of Hong Kong's importance to Europe, and its desire to
see a smooth and successful transition next year.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting with Governor Patten, President Santer stated
that "there is no reason to believe that these ties will diminish
in the years to come".
</P>
<P>
"On the contrary, Hong Kong is and will remain important to
Europe in its own right and as a gateway to China and to the rest
of Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to EC statistics, Hong Kong is the EU's seventh most
important trading partner with bilateral trade of over 21 billion
ECU(one ECU equals about 1.3 US$) and the EU maintains a healthy
trade surplus with Hong Kong, over eight billion ECU in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The EU is also a key investor in Hong Kong, with over 40 EU
banks and over 40 EU insurance companies with offices in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
There are some 100 industrial companies from the EU in Hong
Kong, employing over 20,000 people.

<HEADLINE> UK Factory Output Continues to Stagnate in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Manufacturing output in Britain was
unchanged in May against April, and against a year ago and City
expectations of a small rise, according to figures released by the
Office for National Statistics (ONS) Monday.
</P>
<P>
Although statisticians raised their original estimate of output
in April by a fifth of a percentage point, the underlying trend in
factory output has now been flat for six months and manufacturers
have restrained production to clear stocks of unsold goods from
warehouses.
</P>
<P>
Industrial production, which includes energy production, rose
by an unexpectedly robust 0.8 percent in May, helped by record oil
and gas output and a boost to energy demand because of
unseasonably cold weather.
</P>
<P>
Factory output in the three months to May was nonetheless up
0.3 percent on the previous three, and up 0.4 percent on the same
period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The ONS said that manufacturers are still holding back
production in the face of weak demand from key export markets in
Europe and huge stockpiles built up last year when firms were
caught out by slowing demand at home and then in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Some economists expects manufacturing output to decline in the
rest of the year until firms complete their stock adjustment and
they believed Monday's figures would add to the temptation for the
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke to chance a further cut in interest
rates next month.

Turin to Gap on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Zabel, who had claimed the third stage in Nogent-sur-Oise,

<HEADLINE> Turkish Delegation Starts Visit to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 9 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish trade, industrial and
information delegation headed by Najat Aren, consultant of
external trade relations, arrived here today for a several-day
visit to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Aren said that the visit aims at developing trade relations
between Iraq and Turkey in various fields and getting them back to
normal.
</P>
<P>
He said that the nearly six-year U.N. trade embargo imposed on
Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait has negatively affected the
trade between the two countries and resulted in a sharp reduction
of bilateral trade volumes.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between Turkey and Iraq reached 400 million
U.S. dollars in 1989. The U.N. trade sanctions on Iraq has caused
a loss of 2.5 billion dollars in trade with Iraq for Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish official described his current visit as a starting
point for trade cooperation and a new page to pave the way to
revive the trade relations between the two countries and to give a
new momentum to the activities of the Turkish-Iraqi joint
committee for commercial exchange.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Finance Minister Hekmat al-Azzawi and Governor of the
Central Bank Issam Rashid Huwaish met today separately with the
visiting Turkish official to discussed bilateral relations
in the fields of economy, finance and banking system.

<HEADLINE> Africa Backs Boutros-Ghali for Second-term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African
Unity (OAU) has officially endorsed U.N. Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali for a second term.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced through a declaration of the
53-nation body in its three-day annual summit meeting in Yaounda
Cameroon.
</P>
<P>
The declaration, which was obtained by Xinhua in the U.N.
headquarters this morning, recalled in the first place that in the
Assembly of Heads of State and Government of late 1995 expressed
"appreciation to Boutros-Ghali for his initiative at the helm of
the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
It then reaffirmed the historic importance of the election of
an African as Secretary-General of the United Nations, "thus
enabling Africa to significantly contribute to the attainment of
the principles enshrined in the U.N. Charter and promote
multilateralism."
</P>
<P>
The African countries therefore "recommends that the necessary
steps be taken with all the partners, members of the U.N., to give
Africa a second mandate, for the next five years, and recommends
the candidature of Dr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali for a second term as
Secretary-General of the U.N."
</P>
<P>
The United States has threatened to veto the reappointment of
the 73-year-old Egyptian for a second five-year term, saying that
Boutros-Ghali has become an obstacle towards U.N. reform.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton Administration was not happy with his hesitation to
approve the nomination of Joseph Cornnor, an American professor,
to head the U.N. management department, to establish an internal
oversight office on waste and abuse of power and to approve the
1996-1997 zero growth budget.

<HEADLINE> Insurers Call for Quick Cuts in Greenhouse Gas Emissions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Insurance companies warned here on
Tuesday of enormous economic costs if global actions to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions come too slowly.
</P>
<P>
The warning was made by about 60 insurance companies in a
position paper they presented Tuesday to an international
negotiating conference on climate change resumed in Geneva on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The insurers expressed their concern that while the effect of
climate change on the frequency or severity of extreme weather
events remains unknown, it is clear that even small shifts in
regional climate zones or storm patterns could lead to increased
property damage.
</P>
<P>
They also pointed out that climate change could potentially
have large implications for investment activities as society
anticipates and adapts to new climate regime.
</P>
<P>
The insurers called on countries to take precautionary actions
to reduce the risks of climate change. According to them, the most
efficient precautionary measure is an early and substantial
reduction of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
They also urged governments to promote scientific research that
will establish what threshold level of atmospheric concentrations
of greenhouse gases should be considered dangerous.
</P>
<P>
According to industry sources, the insurance industry is
currently under stress from a series of "Billion Dollar" storms
since 1987. This has led to dramatic increases in claims, reduced
availability of insurance, and higher premiums.
</P>
<P>
"When a major industry such as the insurance sector starts to
worry, so should we," commented Elizabeth Dowdeswell, Exective
Director of the UN Environment Programme.
</P>
<P>
"While some industries think more about the costs of taking
action against climate change, insurers know from experience how
expensive it can be when people fail to protect themselves
adequately from risks," she added.
</P>
<P>
How fast to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is the focus of the
latest negotiating conference, known officially as the second
session of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework
Convention on Climate Change.
</P>
<P>
In the treaty, which was adopted at the 1992 Earth Summit in
Rio de Janeiro, industrialized countries agreed to take measures
to return their greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the
year 2000. But some environmental reports said almost none of them
will meet that target.
</P>
<P>
While the UN and a number of non-governmental organizations are
calling for drastic global action to reduce climate change, major
industries in some countries are urging their governments to take
a go-slow approach, arguing against steps they say could cost jobs
and growth before the problem is better understood.

<HEADLINE> US President Urged to Assist Cyprus Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Greek-Americans will not vote for
U.S. President Bill Clinton's re-election, unless they are
assured he will assist and act toward the solution of the Cyprus
problem, President of the Council of Hellenes Abroad (CHA) Andrew
Athens said here today.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking after a meeting with Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides, whom he briefed on the outcome of the CHA European
branch conference, which ended in Nicosia Monday.
</P>
<P>
The CHA president said President Clerides and the Greek-
Americans share the belief that time is ripe for the
Greek-Americans to press hard to help the Cyprus government reach
a Cyprus solution.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the U.S. government has begun exerting "more
pressure" than before for a Cyprus settlement, adding that the
Greek-Americans are not pleased with former U.S. Presidents'
stance on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Athens explained that "the pressure will be even greater," and
expressed hope that the Cyprus issue will move forward before
the U.S. presidential elections in November.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the Greek-Americans' reaction in case Clinton's
Administration does not achieve any progress on the Cyprus issue
before the elections, the CHA president underlined that "we will
not vote for him unless we are sure President Clinton listens to
us and helps."
</P>
<P>
"When we are sure President Clinton will do something for a
Cyprus solution then we will assist him a great deal," Athens
said.
</P>
<P>
According to an official from the meeting, the three-day CHA
European branch conference, which was participated by 80
representatives from about 1,000 Greek organizations from Central
and Eastern Europe, ended Monday with setting up a good
organizational structure, which is the main goal of the
conference.

<HEADLINE> PA Lists Israeli Violations of Peace Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Authority (PA)
has handed over to the Israeli authorities a long list of Israeli
violations of the peace agreements, reported Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
The violations include delay of Hebron redeployment, delay of
opening safe passages between the Gaza Strip and West Bank,
continuing closure imposed on the Palestinian territories four
months ago, and continuing detention of Palestinian security
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Since its rise to power, the rightwing Likud bloc has declared
that Israel will keep its commitment under the Oslo Accords, but
on condition that the PA fulfills its commitments. Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu has also defended his unwillingness to meet PA
President Yasser Arafat by charging that there are many areas in
which the PA has violated the peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, More than 1,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip
staged a demonstration demanding that the Israeli authorities
release Palestinians still in Israel's jails. It is estimated
that there are still more than 5,000 Palestinian security
prisoners held by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian demonstrators today marched from Gaza city to the
checkpoint at Erez Crossing between Israel and the Gaza
Strip. Palestinian police and Israeli soldiers manned the
roadblocks and were on the alert. But there were no reports of
violence and injuries.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the seven members of the legislative
Palestinian Council did not turn up at the Jerusalem police
station for questioning. By Issuing the summons to the
Palestinian lawmakers Monday, the police aimed at warning them
against violating the rightwing government's ban on PA activity
in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The seven PA officials, including PC Speaker Abu Ala and PA
Minister of Higher Education Hannan Ashrawi, said that the
summons violated the Palestinian-Israeli peace deal which gives
immunity to Palestinian legislators.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Internal Security
Minister Avigdor Kahalani said today that he will hold a meeting
with Senior Palestinian official Faisal Husseini to discuss
various issues.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a visit to the West Bank town of Hebron,
Kahalani said that the meeting was requested by Husseini, who
hold the Jerusalem portfolio in the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA), and the arrangement and time are being fixed.
</P>
<P>
On the refusal of Palestinian Council members from Jerusalem
to answer police summons this morning, Kahalani said the summons
were just to clarify the situation in Jerusalem to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Jerusalem police summoned a number of Palestinian
officials to the police station today to warn them against
violating the ban on PNA activity in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
However, the Palestinian officials, including at least seven
members of the legislative Palestinian Council from Jerusalem, had
all refused to appear.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani said there was no question of a criminal investigation
against the Palestinian officials, while stressing again that the
police will crack down on all PNA activities in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said that he supported easing the four-month
closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip for humanitarian reasons,
as long as changes are made at security checks on all crossing
points.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that he supports the implementation of the
Oslo peace accords between Israel and the Palestinians, namely to
carry out the redeployment of the Israeli army in the West Bank
town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
However, he said only Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who
is currently visiting the U.S., will make the final decision on
the redeployment.
</P>
<P>
He said the Jewish settlements in the Hebron area will remain
under the Israeli army's control, and there will be no changes in
the security arrangements at the Cave of Machpelah.
</P>
<P>
The redeployment of the Israeli troops from Hebron has been
postponed due to a series of suicide bombing attacks in late
February and March and later due to the defeat of former Prime
Minister Shimon Peres in the elections in May.

<HEADLINE> Britain Cuts 1996 Growth Forecast to 2.5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- British Chancellor of the Exchequer
Kenneth Clarke today revised the economic growth forecast for his
country in 1996 to 2.5 percent, down from the 3 percent he
previously predicted.
</P>
<P>
Trying to play down the importance of the new forecast, Clarke
said he expected "a strong pick-up" in the economy in 1996 and
1997, with consumer spending, boosted by tax cuts in April,
"likely to be a major expansionary force."
</P>
<P>
He predicted in a summer economic forecast that Britain's gross
domestic product (GDP) would grow by 3.25 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"My latest view is that output will grow at a healthy rate of
2.5 percent this year, strengthening to 3.25 percent in 1997," he
said.
</P>
<P>
But bad news also accompanied. The chancellor raised his
estimates for the public sector deficit in the next two financial
years, with the 1996-97's figure standing at 27 billion pounds
(41.9 billion U.S. dollars), up from 22.5 billion pounds (34.9
billion dollars) forecast in the November budget, and that for
1997-98 raised markedly to 23 billion pounds (34.5 billion
dollars) from 15 billion pounds (22.5 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
An unexpected shortfall in tax revenues was blamed for the
worsening public deficit, which has aroused concerns over whether
Britain can meet the strict Maastricht criteria to qualify for the
European Union's (EU) economic and monetary union (EMU) in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Those who wish to join must restrain their public deficit to
within 3 percent of GDP in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Britain's public deficit in 1995 was 6 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
Clarke, however, said public borrowing was "unambiguously
coming down" and pledged to "stick to a sensible fiscal policy" to
bring the deficit back to balance in the medium-term.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Oil Industry Urged To Protect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Conservation Foundation
(NCF) and Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF) have called on
operators in the oil industry to make greater efforts to reduce
environmental pollution.
</P>
<P>
They should ensure a high standard of environmental management
and technical performance to reduce pollution in the Niger Delta
area, said the NCF and WWF.
</P>
<P>
"This will reduce water pollution and reverse the rapid
acidification of mud on the bottom of the Bonny river which has a
high concentration of petroleum pollution," the two organizations
said in the current edition of Nature Watch, NCF's newsletter,
which reached here today.
</P>
<P>
NCF and WWF said they supported the establishment of the
proposed Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) project in the Niger Delta
area.
</P>
<P>
"The LNG project will benefit the ordinary Nigerians by
reducing the massive problem created by gas flaring and generate
significant economic and environmental benefits for Nigeria," the
organizations said.
</P>
<P>
According to the newsletter, Nigeria has the worst record of
gas flaring in the world and no less than 76 percent of the gas
produced in the oil fields is flared.
</P>
<P>
But the figure is low in some oil producing countries. Libya
flares 21 percent of its gas, Saudi Arabia, 20 percent, Iran, 19
percent, Mexico, Britain and Algeria, between 4 and 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Nigeria emitted 34 million tons of carbon dioxide and
12 million tons of methane from Delta and Rivers states.
</P>
<P>
The organizations warned that the negative effects of emitting
nitrogen oxide and sulphur dioxide during gas flaring had
resulted in health problems and discomfort to many inhabitants of
Nigeria's oil production areas.
</P>
<P>
The LNG project, which is deemed necessary in this context,
was launched in 1989 as a joint venture between Nigerian National
Petroleum Corporation with 60 percent share, Shell Gas BV, 20
percent, and Cleg Ltd, 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The project will involve development of two gas liquification
plants and a gas transmission system linking the plant by
pipeline to the gas supply fields. It is estimated to produce
5.78 million tons of liquified natural gas annually.

<HEADLINE> German Unemployment Remains High in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Germany's unemployment rate dropped
slightly from its May 10 percent to 9.9 percent in June, the
Federal Labor Office said today.
</P>
<P>
This means that another 33,800 people have found their jobs.
But comparing with last June's 9 percent unemployment rate, the
0.1 percent boost is still an unsatisfying improvement.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment we see only a seasonal normalization after the
extreme winter," labor office head Bernhard Jagoda said, adding he
did not expect a turnaround before the fall at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
German unemployment reached a postwar high of an unadjusted
4.27 million people in February. Jobless rate in the country's
eastern part fell to 15 percent in June from 15.2 percent in May
while that in the western part remained at 8.7 percent, the labor
office said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that increasing enterprise bankruptcies,
mismanagement and lack of impetus for economic growth contributed
to the current high unemployment.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia's Economy on Right Path, Says World Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank said Ethiopia,
once synonym to war and famine, has been showing encouraging
economic performances since a new government came to power five
years ago.
</P>
<P>
In its 1995 report, the World Bank said a significant start
has been made towards liberalizing the country's economy. It
added, Ethiopia has made substantial progress by slashing its
defense expenditure from 31 percent to 2 percent of the GDP,
adding that military expenditure in sub-Saharan African countries
stands at 4.5 percent on average of their GDP.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank said export taxes, except coffee, the mainstay
of the country's economy, have been eliminated and license fees
have been substantially reduced for coffee exporters.
</P>
<P>
Nearly two decades of civil war, recurrent droughts and high
population growth rate have left the country with very high rates
of poverty, the World Bank said.
</P>
<P>
Budgetary allocations for social expenditures were increased
from around 16 percent of the total budget during the pre-reform
period to 23 percent in 1995, it added.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia's Prime Minister Meles Zenawi told the parliament
last week that the country's overall economy has grown by 7.7
percent during the just ended fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> UK Factory Output Prices Fall Sharply in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- British manufacturers cut output
prices for the second month in a row in June in an effort to boost
sluggish demand and clear unsold stocks, according to the latest
data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers' output prices fell by 0.2 percent in June, the
biggest monthly fall since December 1991. This took the annual
rate of factory gate inflation to a 19-month low of 2.6 percent,
down from 2.8 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said manufacturers were able to cut prices partly
because their own input costs fell last month.
</P>
<P>
Raw material prices fell by a seasonally adjusted 1.3 percent
in June, the largest monthly decline since September 1993. Input
prices are now two percent lower than in the equivalent month last
year, the steepest annual decline in more than two years.
</P>
<P>
Excluding volatile food, drink, tobacco and petrol prices,
input prices were 4.7 percent lower in June than they were a year
ago. This is the biggest annual fall in 5.5 years and has helped
to offset the rising cost of labour.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury said that it expected factory gate inflation to
fall further in coming months. Yet some of its officials fear that
any interest rate cut in response would be a mistake given the
upturn in manufacturing activity which they expect later this
year.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Lawmakers Ask Japan to Compensate Comfort Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 9 (Xinhua) -- South Korean lawmakers today asked
the Japanese government to compensate the women who were forced
into sex slaves by the Japanese army during World War II.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Japanese Embassy here, 270 members of South
Korea's National Assembly, namely parliament, said that Tokyo
should no longer evade its responsibility over the women victims,
but instead admit the crime of its aggresive war.
</P>
<P>
They noted that it is government compensation, not civilian
funds, that should be given to the victims.
</P>
<P>
A total of 200,000 women, mostly Koreans, were reportedly
recruited as comfort women for the Japanese army as it invaded
East and Southeast Asia in the 1930s and 1940s.
</P>
<P>
Japan ruled the Korean Peninsula as a colony from 1910 until
Tokyo's World War II defeat in 1945.

<HEADLINE> EU Keeps Narrowing Trade Deficit with Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Trade deficit of the European
Union (EU) with Japan was down slightly to 20.7 billion ECU (26.9
billion U.S. dollars) last year, said a report today by EUROSTAT,
the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
The report added that this was in line, albeit weaker, with the
trend since 1991 and 1992, when the deficit was around 30 billion
ECU (39 billion dollars) that fell, in 1994, to 21.8 billion ECU
(28.34 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
EUROSTAT attributed the improvement of EU's foreign trade to
its slowed-down imports and growing exports with Japan.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, EU's imports -- excluding the three new members of
Finland, Sweden and Austria -- from Japan amounted to 50.6 billion
ECU (65.7 billion dollars), up 4.5 percent from 1994 while its
exports rose by 12.5 percent to 29.9 billion ECU (38.8 billion
dollars) in the same period.
</P>
<P>
EUROSTAT's figure also showed that Japan supplied 8.7 percent
of EU's total imports and bought 5.1 percent of the single
market's exports.
</P>
<P>
Manufactured items accounted for 98 percent of EU's imports
from Japan last year and 85 percent of its exports to the country.
</P>
<P>
Machinery and transport equipment took the lion's share of EU's
trade: 74 percent of imports and 38 of exports, with
trasnportation vehicles alone taking 21 and 18 percent
respectively. About 40 percent of EU's imported vehicles in 1995
came from Japan.
</P>
<P>
The biggest deficits for the EU were in electrical goods,
office equipments and data-processing machines, road vehicles,
telecommunications and sound-recording equipments.
</P>
<P>
Its biggest surpluses were in clothing, beverages and medical
and pharmaceuticals .
</P>
<P>
As most EU countries showed a deficit with Japan, Denmark and
Italy recorded a small surplus of around 0.6 billion ECU (0.78
billion dollars) each.
</P>
<P>
Britain registered the largest deficit of 7.1 billion ECU (9.23
billion dollars), followed by Germany of 5.9 billion ECU (7.67
billion dollars) and the Netherlands of 4 billion ECU (5.2 billion
dollars).

<HEADLINE> Swazi Civil Servants End Strike, Teachers Press </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 9 (Xinhua) -- A wildcat strike by civil
servants in Swaziland was called off after negotiators accepted
the government's final offer of a 10.9 percent salary increase,
the South African Press Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
The strike was called by the Swaziland Civil Servants
Association last month to protest the government's original offer
of 9.9 percent increase in their salaries.
</P>
<P>
However, a strike by some 10,000 Swazi school teachers entered
its fourth week on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland Teachers' Association (STA) staged the wildcat
strike last month, demanding a pay increase of 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, striking teachers and civil servant leaders
agreed on a position with the government negotiating team after a
painstaking meeting, but when they returned to their members for
a mandate, teachers decided to continue striking while civil
servants accepted the government's offer.
</P>
<P>
Swazi Labour Minister Albert Shabangu warned on
Tuesday that the striking teachers risked having their contracts
with the government terminated.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the teachers' leaders are well aware of this risk to
their members," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
STA President Phineas Magagula said, however, the STA national
executive has failed to convince branch executive members to
suspend the strike and allow negotiations to proceed.

<HEADLINE> Russian Soldiers Killed in Renewed Fighting in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 9 (Xinhua) -- At least three Russian soldiers were
killed today by Chechen separatist fighters in a renewed fierce
battle in southwestern Chechnya, shattering a fragile ceasefire
which had lasted almost six weeks.
</P>
<P>
The fighting started early this morning when several bodies of
captured Russian servicemen were found on the edge of Gekhi, a
strongly pro-separatist village, a report of the Itar-Tass news
agency said.
</P>
<P>
But the report did not mention the possible casualities on the
Chechen side.
</P>
<P>
Later this afternoon, Russian military announced that they
would reimpose a dawn-to-dusk curfew in the breakaway north
Caucasus republic.
</P>
<P>
The curfew order came after an ultimatum sent by Vyacheslav
Tikhomirov, Russia's top commander in Chechnya, to the Chechen
separatists demanding the release of the illegally detained
Russian soldiers and Chechen government representatives before
18:00 Moscow time on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tikhomirov said Russian forces would take appropriate measures
to determinedly wipe out the militants if the demand was not met.
</P>
<P>
Until 15:00 this afternoon, the Chechen side did not give any
response to the ultimatum, and the Russian troops had been ordered
to prepare for action.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Russian presidential press office said that
re-elected president Boris Yeltsin had discussed the situation in
Chechnya with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, and Yeltsin
reiterated the importance of a peaceful settlement to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
More than 30,000 people have been killed after Russia sent
troops into Chechnya in December 1994 to crush an independence bid
there.
</P>
<P>
Also in the ultimatum, Tikhomirov accused the rebels of
violating the agreement signed between the two warring sides in
May to solve the conflict peacefully.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chechen militants had violated the cease-fire
agreement for at least 590 times, resulting in the deaths of 47
Russian soldiers and the wounding of more than 200 people.

<HEADLINE> Oxford University Appoints 162 New Professors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Oxford University has almost doubled
its number of professors, appointing today 162 professors in an
unprecedented attempt to raise the status of its dons, local press
reports say today.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the newly-appointed professors will not
receive any financial benefits, but that the appointees will be
able to use the coveted title.
</P>
<P>
The mass promotion was agreed last year by the University
Congregation, the parliament of dons, to provide recognition to
scholars of international reputation who were not getting the
esteem they deserved because financial constraints prevented their
preferment.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 dons applied for professorships, and were judged
against the research records of holders of the title in other
leading universities, as well as on their teaching and
administrative work.
</P>
<P>
A Distinctions Committee of 14 academics has accepted the
claims of 162 dons to become professors and promoted another 99 to
the lesser title of reader.
</P>
<P>
The 80 percent success rate will bring the number of professors
to 361, and the 99 new readers will take the total of readerships
to 206, out of an academic staff of 1,262.
</P>
<P>
The number of women professors has risen from 12 to 30, and the
number of women readers has increased from eight to 20.
</P>
<P>
Dr Paul Slack, the chairman of Oxford's General Board, said:
"The purpose of this exercise was to give appropriate recognition
to the outstanding quality of the academics in this university,
despite the financial pressures which prevent us from increasing
the number of professors."

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Germany will not agree to the
Netherlands exporting 50 German-made Leopard tanks to Botswana,
the South African Press Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
Leading German parliamentarian, Deputy Speaker of the
Bundestag Burkhard Hirsch made the statement on Monday at
meetings with Namibian Prime Minister Hage Geingob and Speaker
Mose Tjitendero in Windhoek.
</P>
<P>
Hirsch said German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel had sent a
personal message to Geingob to this effect.
</P>
<P>
The German deputy speaker made the assurance following
reports that Botswana will purchase 50 German-made
Leopard tanks from the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Germany, as a member of the European Union, has a final say in
the Botswana-Netherlands tanks deal on condition that its arms
exported to third parties.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Geingob on Monday, Hirsch said: "If
the Netherlands wants to stay within international law, the 50
Leopards will not be delivered."
</P>
<P>
However, he said that Germany could not prevent Botswana
looking elsewhere for weaponary if they were determined to obtain
it.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Defends Greek Warplanes' Flight over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Foreign Minister Alecos
Michaelides said here today that there has been no violation of
Cyprus' air-space by Greek warplanes because they had permission
from the Cyprus authorities.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on representations made by the U.S. to the
government of Greece about the flight of Greek warplanes over
Cyprus during military exercises as part of the joint defense
dogma accepted by Cyprus and Greece.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press after the meeting of the Council of
Ministers, Michaelides stressed that "Greek planes had the
permission of the Cyprus government and have not violated the
island's airspace."
</P>
<P>
"If there is one country that has been violating Cyprus
sovereignty for the last 22 years, that is Turkey which still
unlawfully occupies 37 percent of island's territory," he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister said it is understandable that the U.S. worries
about the situation on the island, but he stressed that the answer
to Greek and Turkish planes flying over Cyprus would be Cyprus
President Glafcos Clerides' proposal for the demilitarization of
the island.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here from Athens, the Greek
government spokesman Demetris Repas has rejected the
U.S. representations, stressing that the problem in Cyprus is that
of continuing Turkish occupation of the northern part of the
island.
</P>
<P>
He also said the joined defense dogma between Cyprus and
Greece remains a basic element of Greek defense policy.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO allies, are at odds over Cyprus,
the east Mediterranean strategic island, which has been divided
since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied 37 percent of its
territory following a coup by the Greek Cypriots seeking union with
Greece.

<HEADLINE> 31 Zimbabwean Clothing Firms Go Under </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Some 31 Zimbabwean clothing firms
have gone out of business since January last year, leaving more
than 3,000 people jobless, the National Employment Council for
the clothing industry said today.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the council said 19 of the companies operated
in northern and eastern Zimbabwe with the rest from the south and
western provinces.
</P>
<P>
This year alone, five companies, three of them from Bulawayo,
the country's second largest city and two from Harare, have gone
under, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said 19,800 people were now employed in the clothing sector
compared to 23,000 mid-last year, but the actual number of people
thrown onto the streets could be much higher as the figures did
not include contract workers.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said many of the companies driven out of
business had been under provisional liquidation for some time.
</P>
<P>
Most of them could not survive punitive interest rates of
around 30 percent, while depressed domestic demand worsened their
problems, he said.

<P>
LONDON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela started his first state visit to Britain earlier today in
a bid to encourage British businessmen to make further investment
in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Speaking shortly after his arrival in London, Mandela is quoted
as saying, "I am among friends, I hope that this visit will help
all around relations -- political, economic and others."
</P>
<P>
The-78-year-old President stressed that he would use the visit
to thank the British government for the "massive support they have
given our government."
</P>
<P>
"It must not be forgotten that the masses of the people in this
country and elsewhere, were in the forefront of the anti-apartheid
struggle," he said.
</P>
<P>
This afternoon, Queen Elizabeth, accompanied by British Prime
Minister John Major and other senior government officials, staged
a grand welcoming ceremony in honor of President Mandela at the
Horse Guards Parade.
</P>
<P>
During the four-day-visit, Mandela, who spent 27 years in
prison in South Africa before becoming the country's president, is
expected to address a joint session of the British parliament.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, accompanied by a delegation of more than one hundred
businessmen, is due to hold talks with officials of the Bank of
England and the Confederation of British Industry to discuss
further British investment in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night, eight British universities would award
President Mandela honorary degrees at a joint ceremony to be held

SEOUL, July 9 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and Paraguay agreed here
today to boost their trade ties with the signing of a host of
cooperation agreements.
</P>
<P>
South Korean President Kim Young-sam and his Paraguayan
counterpart Juan Carlos Wasmosy also expressed satisfaction over
the cooperative ties between the two countries over the past few
years, saying that economic cooperative projects will greatly
contribute to their social and economic development.
</P>
<P>
Kim urged Paraguay to play an active role in expanding economic
ties between South Korea and the Central and South American
region, which is growing rapidly into a new industrializing bloc
in the world.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Wasmosy highly appreciated Seoul's efforts to
enhance its relations with the Central and South American
countries and promised Paraguay's support to these efforts.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed agreements on extradition, exchange of
youth volunteers as well as South Korea's provision of Economic
Development Cooperation Fund (EDCF) loan to Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
Wasmosy arrived here yesterday for a four-day state visit at
the invitation of Kim.
</P>

Last year, South Korea's exports to Paraguay amounted to 175
million U.S. dollars, while its imports from the South American

<HEADLINE> Researcher Sees Hope of Nigerian Vaccine Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- A Nigerian vaccine against malaria
is hopeful if more scientists get involved in the research effort
to develop it, a senior scientist said here today.
</P>
<P>
"We need to encourage more scientists to get involved in
researches that would lead to the development of new and more
effective vaccine against disease that debilitate the health of
our people," said Lateef Salako, Director-General of the Nigerian
Institute of Medical Research, quoted by the News Agency of
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The research is very important to the country because "in
Africa it is estimated that about three million children die of
malaria disease annually and out of the number, 300,000 are from
Nigeria," Salako said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the research effort of his institute to
develop a vaccine against malaria, which began a few years ago,
is at the last stage of the basic research, involving the
sequencing of the parasites to identify antigens before
amplification.
</P>
<P>
According to the professor, global efforts to develop a
vaccine against malaria, initiated in 1955 by the World Health
Organization, has failed to yield universally accepted results
because of the heterogeneity of the structure of the cells of the
parasites.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Sends Money for Light-Water Reactor in DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 9 (Xinhua) -- South Korea today remitted 6 million
U.S. dollars to the Korean Peninsula Energy Development
Organization (KEDO) as pre-project service costs for a light-water
reactor in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
The amount given to KEDO's Secretariat, which takes up two
thirds of the estimated 9 million dollars required for the
pre-project service, was decided last March at the KEDO Executive
Board meeting in New York.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Japan donated three million U.S. dollars to the KEDO
for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
The KEDO, a multinational consortium led by the United States,
South Korea and Japan, is responsible for supplying two reactors
to the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Under the Washington-Pyongyang framework agreement signed in
Geneva in October 1994, two 1,000-megawatt light-water nuclear
reactors will be provided to the DPRK in return for DPRK's
freezing of its nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
The KEDO has selected South Korea as the prime supplier of the
light-water reactors.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Expected to Press Netanyahu to Meet Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. president Bill Clinton is
scheduled to meet on Tuesday with Israeli new Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and talk on the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said Clinton plans to press Netanyahu, who
defeated Labor leader Shimon Peres in the May election with a
narrow margin, to make a public declaration on his willingness to
meet with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
"Getting a public statement from the prime minister that he is
willing to meet with Arafat is something the president is looking
for," Nicholas Burns, a State Department spokesman, said at a
briefing on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, unlike his predecessor Peres, who met regularly with
Arafat over the affairs in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, has ruled
out the meeting, saying it is possible only when security concerns
are adequately addressed.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's land-for-peace initiative, which was in line with
that of former Israeli Prime Ministers Yitzhak Rabin and Peres,
might be pushed aside as Likud hard-liner Netanyahu has stressed
in his inauguration last month that peace can be held only with
security instead of trading the land, snatched by Israel during
the 1967 war from Arabs, for the peace.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president, however, has to keep close ties now with
the U.S.-educated prime minister and is showing considerable
patience to work out a strategy with him for Arab-Israeli
negotiations in an attempt to carry out his peace goals in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The United States, meanwhile, has demonstrated some
flexibility, saying that its strategy for peace in the Middle East
may have to be adjusted to accommodate Netanyahu's view.
</P>
<P>
"The policy of land-for-peace won't change, but the route to
those goals will have to reflect (Netanyahu's) plans," State
Secretary Warren Christopher said during his visit to Israel last
month.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is expected to show some conciliatory gestures
towards Palestinians to soften his right-wing edge, but his tone
was uncompromising.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for the United States, Netanyahu said he is to
seek for "understanding" from Americans of his position that peace
must guarantee Israel's security, which observers said is a
euphemism for slowing the peace precess.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that I am going to visit the greatest friend of
Israel does not change my deep beliefs or my fundamental
commitments to the Israeli cause," he said. "I am not going in
order to curry favor with anybody."

STOCKHOLM, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Olympic table tennis champion
Jan-Ove Waldner of Sweden may miss the forthcoming Atlanta Olympic
Games due to a thumb injury, according to a Swedish newspaper

take about a week for it to get better. I can only hope it will,"
Waldner said.
</P>
<P>
"But if I don't feel well enough to do my best when singles
play starts on July 25, I won't go there only to be a tourist,"
he added.

ADDIS ABABA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian private coffee
traders in West Haraghe, a well-known coffee producing area, have
begun stockpiling coffee due to a sharp decline in coffee price,
a report reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the Coffee Quality and Control Office head
Manbegirot Kebede as saying that around 900 tons of unwashed
coffee is stockpiled in Asebe Teferi.
</P>
<P>
He said the price of a 17 kgs of coffee has fallen to 200 Birr
(about three US Dollars) from 345 Birr (about five US Dollars)
last September.
</P>
<P>
He added that peasant coffee growers are even reluctant to
supply the central market with coffee due to the decrease in
coffee price.
</P>
<P>
Coffee is the mainstay of Ethiopia's economy which fetches
close to 60 percent of the country's foreign earning. The nation
exports about 80,000 tons of coffee every year.

<HEADLINE> Britain Enjoys Record Numbers of Inward Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Another record of inward investment
projects and jobs came to Britain in 1995-96. And the year saw a
record, in terms of individual investors, said British Board of
Trade President Ian Lang here today.
</P>
<P>
Lang was launching the Invest in Britain Bureau's 1996 Annual
Review of Operations, which recorded 477 inward investment
projects in 1995-96 -- up 10 percent on 1994-95 and the highest
ever. The "new jobs" figure broke all previous records and at
48256 was up a massive 30 percent on 1994-95.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launch, Lang said: "Our stock of inward
investment is now over 150 billion pounds (225 billion US
dollars), up from 44.3 billion pounds (66.45 billion US dollars)
in 1985. In a decade, more than 100 billion (150 billion US
dollars) of new investment has been put into the British economy
by the world's business leaders."
</P>
<P>
In the last three year alone Britain has seen over 1350 new
projects, leading directly to nearly 114000 new jobs and either
creating or safeguarding a total of more than 285000.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the president said: "These jobs are in tomorrow's
industries -- highly skilled and bringing the very best in
management standards, with enormous potential for progress, by
example, through the indigenous industrial supply chains."
</P>
<P>
The inward investment record is good news for the whole of
British industry. According to the annual review, companies such
as Siemens, Fujitsu, Toyota, NEC, Samsung, Honda, Chunghwa and
Nissan make a vital difference to the local economy wherever they
choose to set up operations. Supply chains create real
opportunities for huge numbers of British firms.

<P>
PARIS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Heavy snowfalls and unexpected
temperature drop give the French people real cool days this
summer, with today's daytime temperature in Paris reading 20
degree Celsius, a 21-year low, the weather bureau said.
</P>
<P>
Winds up to 180 kilometers per hour swept across the north of
the Mediterranean island of Corsica and areas in southeastern
France had as much rain on Sunday a day as usually in a month and
a half of summer.
</P>
<P>
Temperatures Sunday afternoon in Clermont-Ferrand, Macon,
Dijon and other central cities fell to 14 degrees Celsius, the
lowest in 50 years or at least 10 degrees Celsius below the
seasonal average.
</P>
<P>
Snowfalls and strong winds in the Alps even forced bicycle
riders at the Tour de France to change to buses to avoid likely
dangers on a uphill course.
</P>
<P>
But the cold weather does not necessarily mean that the French
poeple should take out their spring fashions, because just a month
ago the temperature stood at 30 degree Celsius, and the weatherman
said it will warm up any time. No wonder some French are saying
that France has lost its seasons.

friend, Abdullah said, relations with the giant Asian nation will
be easy.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said the friendly ties between Malaysia
and China gave both countries the opportunity to forge cooperation
in various fields and enable them to resolve common problems such
as the overlapping claims over some islands in the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
Hanley arrived here yesterday for a two-day visit to seek
Malaysia's view on the situation in the region, especially the
role played by China.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah told the press after the meeting that he had told
Hanley that he was confident China would continue to allow the
development of the dynamic Hong Kong economy after the Britain
colony is reunited with the mainland next year.
</P>
<P>
"I told Hanley that China will not do anything that will be
adverse to Hong Kong," the Malaysian minister said.

ATHENS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Greece today firmly rejected a
demarche lodged by the U.S. embassy in Athens several days ago
concerning flights by Greek aircraft over Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Confirming a local report Monday, government spokesman Dimitris
Reppas said the flights were carried out with the express
authority of the government of the republic of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"The demarche was rejected because its rationale was not
understandable," Reppas said. "A third party cannot involve itself
with the republic of Cyprus' internal issues."
</P>
<P>
Greek warplanes flew to Cyprus to take part in a recent
military exercises on the island in accordance with a joint
defence agreement between Athens and Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Reppas said Greece and Cyprus' unified defence doctrine
remained a primary factor in Greece's defence planning and
obviously could not be exempted from the policy followed by the
Greek government.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question, Reppas said he was unaware of whether
the U.S. or any other country had lodged a similar demarche with
Turkey regarding the flights of Turkish fighter air craft over
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, an east Mediterranean island country, has been divided
into Greek Cypriot South and Turkish Cypriot North since 1974 when
Turkey sent troops to take over one third of its territory
following an anti-Makarios coup engineered by the then Greek
military junta.

<HEADLINE> UK Deserves to Be Semiconductor Capital of Europe, Lang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The UK electronics sector has earned
a world-wide reputation as a centre for excellence based on
innovation and quality.
</P>
<P>
Britain is now widely as the semiconductor capital
of Europe with more fabrication plants than any other country.
</P>
<P>
The success of the industry was highlighted today by the
publication of the Invest in Britain Bureau (IBB) Annual Review of
Operations 1996. The review shows that the UK is now home to
manufacturing plants for 11 of the world's 20 leading electronics
companies.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the electronics section of the review, President
of the Board of Trade, Ian Lang said: "The semiconductor capital
of Europe is an impressive title and, with over half of the
world's leading electronics companies based here and an
electronics industry worth an estimated 22 billion pounds (33
billion US dollars), it is one that the UK well deserves."
</P>
<P>
"In the past year we have seen electronics investment projects
coming to the UK from North America, Asia and continental Europe
bringing with them many thousands of skilled jobs," the president
said.
</P>
<P>
The electronics sector is vital to many other industries, such
as car manufacturing and telecommunications, where it has
benefited and contributed to their increased productivity.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Lang said, these supply chains would create real
opportunities for large numbers of British firms.

<HEADLINE> Greece, Cyprus Enjoy Close Economic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Greece and Cyprus are working
closely on consolidating already strong economic ties, Cypriot
Commerce, Industry and Tourism Minister Andreas Christofias told
the semi- official Athens News Agency (ANA) in an exclusive
interview.
</P>
<P>
The volume of trade last year between Greece and Cyprus
increased 12 percent over 1994 figures, totaling 153.4 million
Cyprus pounds (about 300 million u.s. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"The prospects for closer cooperation between Cypriot and
Greek commercial and industrial circles are encouraging,"
Christofias said. "commerce, industry, agriculture and tourism
are sectors which can be taken advantage of, not only on a
bilateral level but through joint ventures."
</P>
<P>
These joint ventures could target the markets in the Balkans,
the Black Sea area and the Middle East, he said, adding that there
were unlimited possibilities in all sectors.
</P>
<P>
"To achieve this goal, the governments of Cyprus and Greece
are working systematically and exchanging ideas on specific
activities and initiatives which aim at the implementation of
bilateral agreements which have been concluded and foresee
Greek-Cypriot cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The relations in the tourism sector are excellent, the Cypriot
minister said. Some 150,000 Cypriots, approximately half of those
who holiday abroad, choose Greece while the number of Greeks
visiting Cyprus is also on the rise.

<HEADLINE> Climate Change Posing Threat to Human Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Climate change is likely to disturb
various natural and ecological systems, posing serious threat to
human health, said a report jointly released Tuesday by relevant
United Nations specialized agencies at a session on global warming
issue.
</P>
<P>
"In destablizing the world's climate and its dependent
ecosystems, we are posing new and widespread risks to human
health", said the report, which assesses potential health
consequences of human-induced climate change, while conceding that
much more research needs to be done.
</P>
<P>
The pace of climate change is predicted to be unprecedentedly
quick due to the accumulation in atmosphere of greenhouse gases
such as carbon dioxide. The least direct health effects would be
those due to socioeconomic disruption caused by environmental
deterioration, the most direct would be those caused by heatwaves,
storms and floods.
</P>
<P>
The extreme weather events may be more frequent and severe as
the climate is getting warmer and wetter. Experts predict a 1-3
centigrade degree growth in global mean surface temperature by the
year 2100, and that we would have higher sea level, more heavy
rainfalls, more floods, more bushfires, as well as longer and more
severe droughts.
</P>
<P>
Hot weather would lead to up to several thousand extra
heat-related deaths annually by around 2050 in many big cities
worldwide. The increase would outweigh the decline in
winter-related mortality.
</P>
<P>
The report said that many of the indirect public health effects
due to climate change would occur slowly, via climate impacts upon
agriculture, ocean fisheries and infectious disease transmission.
</P>
<P>
Climate change allows disease vectors to extend territory,
helping infectious diseases spread and kill more people. In the
next century, it would increase the global incidence of malaria by
50 to 80 million additional cases annually, and the vulnerable
population would rise from the current 45 percent to about 60
percent of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
The incidence of food-and water-related infections such as
cholera would also grow, particularly in tropical and sub-tropical
regions, following changes in water distribution, temperature and
the proliferation of microorganisms, the report added.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, by exacerbating the production of some
types of air pollutants, climate change would result in the
increase in the incidence of related health problems, such as
cardio-vascular and respiratory disorders.
</P>
<P>
In some regions, warmer and wetter climate could also lead to
higher concentration in air of various pollens and spores with a
possible impact on allergic disorders, such as hay fever and
asthma.
</P>
<P>
Sustained stratospheric ozone depletion -- a factor closely
related to climate change, which leads to increased exposure to
ultraviolet radiation, would cause increased cases of skin cancer,
and possibly of ocular lesions, such as cataracts.
</P>
<P>
It may also impair human immune system, said the report, which
was released at the July 8-19 session in Geneva of the Conference
of the Parties of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.

<HEADLINE> WMO to Launch Heat Index Card During Atlanta Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The World Meteorological
Organization (WMO) announced on Tuesday that it will launch a Heat
Index Card during the Atlanta Olympic Games in order to alert more
effectively the general public about the hazards of heat waves.
</P>
<P>
The pocket-sized Card, which will be launched in cooperation
with U.S. National Weather Service, is part of WMO's ongoing
public awareness campaign to promote "Meteorology in the Services
of Sports", the theme of this year's World Meteorological Day.
</P>
<P>
With a simple reference to air temperature and relative
humidity, the Card enables users to be aware of the different kind
of dangers involved with prolonged exposure to heat.
</P>
<P>
For example, when the air temperature is 33 centigrade degrees
with a relative humidity of 65 percent, users should guard against
sunstroke, muscle cramps or heat exhaustion. Man should act with
the same caution if the air temperature is lower but the humidity
is higher.
</P>
<P>
According to an introduction of the Card, the Heat Index
involves certain assumptions about the human body and the
surrounding environment.
</P>
<P>
Human bodies dissipate heat by varying the rate and depth of
blood circulation, by losing water through the skin and sweat
glands, and by panting when blood is heated above 37 centigrade
degrees. The skin handles about 90 percent of the body's heat
dissipating function.
</P>
<P>
However, sweating alone will not cool the body unless the water
evaporated from the skin. A high relative humidity retards this
evaporation.
</P>
<P>
Heat kills by taxing the human body beyond its abilities. It is
estimated that in the United States, from 1936 to 1975, nearly
20,000 people were killed as a result of exposure to heat and
solar radiation; In the heat wave of 1980, more than 1,250 people
died and in that of July 1995, more than 500 lost their lives.

<HEADLINE> One Villager Wounded in Israel's Shelling of South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli forces in south Lebanon
bombarded this morning suspected guerrilla targets on hills
opposite the Israeli self-claimed "security zone", wounding one
local villager, the state-run Lebanese National News Agency (LNNA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
Israeli forces, stationed at the position of Zafata,
Nabatiyeh, fired artilleries at Iglim Al-Toffah, or Province of
Apple, a ridge some 60 kilometers south of Beirut which is often
used by Shiite Moslem guerrillas as a springboard to launch
attacks at Israeli force in the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
The LNNA said that a first barrage of shells hit Jebal Rafih at
5:00 a.m. (02:00 GMT), wounding Khalid Rijb, a 14-year-old girl,
as she was collecting wild thyme in the field. The girl was
hospitalized in the south Lebanese market town of Nabatiyeh.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli artillery expanded the targeting areas at 8:30
a.m. (05:30 GMT), and shelled the valleys neighboring the Israeli
position of Soueida, the Zahrani river basin and vicinities of the
villages of Sejoud and Rihan, while the bombardment at Jebal Rafih
was sporadic continuing.
</P>
<P>
The bombardments were accompanied by heavy machine-gun fire,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Voice of the South" Radio, the mouthpiece of the South Lebanon
Army (SLA) militia, claimed that its militiamen at Soueida
blocked a group of guerrillas attempting to infiltrate into the
buffer enclave through a valley of the Zahrani river basin this
morning.
</P>
<P>
The radio said that the militiamen showered upon the
infiltrators with artilleries and machine-guns, causing
casualties to the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The radio added that the SLA militiamen exchanged fire with a
second group of guerrillas near the Druzi castle outside the
border strip.
</P>
<P>
Israel and pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, have
frequently accused each other of violating the cease-fire
understanding reached between Lebanon and the Jewish state on
April 26, which ended 16 days of Israeli military strikes in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah argues that the U.S.-broked understanding, which
banned both Israeli forces and Hezbollah guerrillas from attacking
at civilian areas, does not deprive "the legitimate right" of
resistance against the Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on the formation of a cease-fire monitoring
committee, which comprises the U.S., France, Israel, Syria and
Lebanon, was suspended on the eve of the May 29 Israeli general
election.
</P>
<P>
Nine Israeli soldiers have been killed and 25 others wounded
since the cease-fire was enforced in the last active Arab-Israeli
battlefront, bringing the number of Israelis killed to 16 and
wounded to 56 this year.

<HEADLINE> Tariff Reduction of Imported Materials Benefits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Zambian manufacturers have saved 25
billion Kwacha (20 million US Dollars) due to government
reduction of tariffs on some imported production materials.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed in the latest Zamnews, a publication of the
Zambia Association of Manufacturers (ZAM).
</P>
<P>
Zamnews quoted ZAM Chairman Mark O. Donnel as saying the
achievement was resulted from the association's active lobbying
to the government over the past three years for reduction of the
tariffs on machinery, capital equipment and some raw materials.
</P>
<P>
Last year's lobbying saved a total of 12 millioin US Dollars
for the manufacturers through tariff reductions on five
categories of materials while the 1996 budget further reduced
tariffs by eight million US Dollars, according to Zamnews.
</P>
<P>
The chairman deplored South Africa for not fully opening up to
competition to neighboring countries. South Africa flooded its
neighbors with cheap goods that adversely affected their
industries, he said, noting that trade must be balanced unlike
the current situation where south africa could export goods worth
300 million dollars to Zambia while it was hard for Zambia's
goods to go to South Africa. enditem

<HEADLINE> Bosnia Expects 20-Million-Dollar Donation from Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian government is looking
forward to the 20-million-dollar donation from Turkey, which was
promised by Turkish President Suleyman Demirel during his state
visit to the war-devastated Bosnia-Herzegovina last month.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a Bosnian delegation headed by Bosnian Finance
Minister Mirsad Kilanovic visited Ankara and discussed the
conditions of the donation with Turkish officials. Further
meetings will be held in Sarajevo in the coming weeks, Anatolia
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian government has requested that the money be made
available by the end of summer.
</P>
<P>
However, the Turkish side would like to see Turkish firms take
part in the reconstruction work for the war-ravaged country, while the
Bosnian government insists that the aid money should go to Bosnian
companies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a protocol has been signed between Turk Eximbank
and the Bosnian government concerning the 80-million-dollar line
of credit that has been opened for Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak: No Progress in Talks between Egypt, Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said
today that the ongoing talks between Egypt and Sudan have made no
significant progress toward improving bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Information Minister Safwat el-Sherif quoted Mubarak
as saying that such progress can only be made after Sudan turns
over the Moslem militants involved in terrorist operations in
Egypt as well as an assassination attempt on him in Addis Ababa in
June last year.
</P>
<P>
Sherif said the president explained in a closed-door meeting
with government officials that contacts between Egypt and Sudan
since the Arab summit in Cairo last month had produced no tangible
results.
</P>
<P>
During the summit, Mubarak met with Sudanese President Omar
al-Bashir in a move which has been hailed as a first step toward
patching up differences between the two neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's relations with Sudan have been strained since al-Bashir
came to power in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Egypt accuses Sudan of masterminding the assassination attempt
on Mubarak and backing Islamic militants fighting to topple the
Egyptian government. Sudan has denied the accusations but
expressed willingness to cooperate with Egypt in fighting
terrorism.

<HEADLINE> Perry Vows to Take Offensive against Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Perry vowed on Tuesday to take the offensive against terrorist
activities following last month's truck bombing in an American
military facilities in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
He told a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing that security
measures have been recommended to protect the lives of American
military personnel deployed in Saudi Arabia, including a plan to
move U.S. military forces out of Riyadh and other urban places to
remote desert bases.
</P>
<P>
"But we should not limit our response to this outrageous attack
to passive security measures," Perry said. "We should go on the
offensive."
</P>
<P>
Perry admitted that voluminous intelligence on terrorism in the
Persian Gulf was "spotty and inconclusive", which led to
underestimation by U.S. military commanders of the terrorist
threat in Saudi Arabia and left them with a very difficult task in
knowing what to plan for.
</P>
<P>
Gen. John Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
who accompanied Perry, told the hearing that there might be more
explosion incidents taking place and no one has find effective
ways to prevent them.
</P>
<P>
"We must face one hard fact: we will have more terrorist
incidents. No one... has figured out a way to decisively defeat
it," he said.

ANKARA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and Belgium have signed a
security agreement in fighting against international drug
smuggling, terrorism and organized crimes, the semi-official
Anatolia News Agency reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which was signed by Turkey's Security Chief
Alaadin Yuksel and Belgium's General Commander Gendarmerie Willy
Derrider, also includes cooperation on illegal migration, illegal
workers and expert training, the agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Derrider said that the cooperation measures would be put into

effective cooperation despite the differences between Belgium and
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian security chief acknowledged the presence of the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) offices in Belgium. He said
that the representatives were being watched but cautioned that his
department had limited authority because it was a political matter.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Interior Minister Mehmet Agar said during a meeting
with Derrider that the large number of Turks in Belgium and the
rise in terrorist activity there made cooperation between the two
countries more important.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Releases Draft Document on Bail Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 9 (Xinhua) -- A draft document proposing
stricter bail and parole policies and the creation of a single,
national prosecutorial authority was released by Justice Minister
Dullah Omar today in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
The document, entitled ''justice vision 2000'', was a
framework for transforming the administration of justice in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
It proposed witnesses be allowed to give evidence in bail
applications involving serious offences. While communities would
also be involved in considerations of bail applications.
</P>
<P>
It also suggested parole only be invoked once a prisoner had
served ''a substantial part'' of the sentence and proposed the
establishment of an interministerial body to oversee parole.
</P>
<P>
While the power of parole decisions should be vested in an
independent parole board, added the document.
</P>
<P>
After releasing the document, Omar said the prosecutorial
system had been neglected in the past. ''We need to work towards
a single prosecutorial authority.''
</P>
<P>
Proposals envisaged in the document also included, among
others, the development of prosecutorial guidelines and a
coherent and effective prosecutorial policy, the development of a
policy curbing crime through the criminal justice system, in
which criteria for defining serious offences would be set up.
</P>
<P>
However, Omar said the document would be discussed with all
stakeholders at workshops all over the country before it became
law. enditem

<HEADLINE> Ghali Enjoys OAU Support for UN Chief Candidature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The incumbent United Nations
Secretary General Dr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali has been nominated
the African candidate for a second term as U.N. chief by the
Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
According to a resolution endorsed today by the ongoing 32nd
OAU summit meeting held in Yaounde, Cameroon, Ghali's candidate
is overwhelmingly backed by at least 50 out of the OAU's 53
member states.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last Saturday, two days before the opening of the OAU
summit, the United States Assistant Secretary of State George
Moose flew to Yaounde, the venue of the summit, on a lobby
mission to persuade African leaders to drop their support for
Ghali's candidate.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief arrived in Yaounde on the same day to attend
the OAU summit meeting at the invitation of OAU Secretary General
Dr. Salim Ahmed Salim.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats believe Moose has failed in his lobbying mission.
</P>
<P>
"The OAU commends that the necessary steps be taken to give
Africa a second mandate, for the next five years, and recommends
the candidature of Dr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali for a second term as
Secretary General of the U.N.," said the OAU resolution endorsed
here today.
</P>
<P>
There has been no official OAU confirmation of which member
states are opposed to Ghali's candidature. OAU chief Salim
Ahmed Salim only told a press conference here today that two or
three member states are in opposition.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua today, Palestinian President
Yassir Arafat indicated that the opponents include Eritrea and
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
On another occasion, Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyadema
today expressed regret to reporters over Rwanda's opposition to
Ghali's candidature.
</P>
<P>
Ghali's term of office expires later in December 1996, when
election is to be held for the post of U.N. Secretary General.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia, Syria Urge Israel to Proceed With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia and Syria today
called on Israel to fulfil its commitment to the realization of
peace in the Middle East, stressing that a real peace in the
region could come only when the Jewish state take serious attitude
to fully withdraw from all occupied Arab territories including
Arab Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saudi Al-Faisal and his
Syrian counterpart Farouq Al-Shara made the call at the opening
session of the Saudi-Syrian Joint Committee in Riyadh, Saudi
capital, Kuwait News Agency reported from the Saudi capital.
</P>
<P>
They also called on Israel to let the Palestinian people
exercise their right of self-determination in accordance with
international laws and the principle of land-for-peace.
</P>
<P>
They said Israel should withdraw from the Golan Heights to the
pre-June 4, 1967 lines and also from south Lebanon to the
internationally recognized boundaries.
</P>
<P>
Prince Saud stressed that realization of a comprehensive, just
and permanent peace in the Middle East was the only real
guarantee for balanced security for all countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shara was on a visit to Saudi Arabia to co-chair with
Al-Faysal the sixth session of the Syrian-Saudi Higher Committee
which was attended by the two countries' economic and finance
ministers.
</P>
<P>
The session was postponed in April because of Israel's
"Grapes of Wrath" operation against south Lebanon which killed
and wounded more than 600 people.
</P>
<P>
The higher committee, which holds periodical meetings, was
formed in March 1991. It aims at promoting bilateral
relations, especially in the field of economy and trade, in
addition to political co-ordination between the two
countries.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Has 2.25 Million Foreign Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 9 (Xinhua) -- An official of the Arab Labor
Organization (ALO) announced here today that there are 2.25
million foreign workers in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Bakr Rosoul, Director of the ALO, said at the end of a meeting
with Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz, that his statistics
was obtained by collecting informations from different sources.
</P>
<P>
However, the ALO official declined to specify from where these
foreign laborers come.
</P>
<P>
Many Lebanese people have reportedly complained that their
employments are taken away by Syrians seeking fortunes in their
country.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government gave no specific statistics on how many
Syrians are workings in Lebanon, which has an estimated population
of four million. But local press put the number at one million to
three million.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese President Elias Hrawi recently criticized what he
called a "lazyness of the Lebanese people, saying that so many
lands are left to foreign workers for farming when the Lebanese
owners went to cities to find "elegant jobs."
</P>
<P>
Rosoul said that the unemployment among the Lebanese, which now
stood at 20,000, could be eased by promoting their skills and
encouraging their acceptance of different jobs.
</P>
<P>
"The replacement of the foreign labor with the Lebanese workers
can be achieved through setting up vocational training centers and
encouraging any job regardless its kind," he said.

<HEADLINE> African Leaders Back Palestinian Cause </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 9 (Xinhua) -- African leaders today voiced their
support for the Palestinian people in their efforts to win peace
in the middle east.
</P>
<P>
The support is included in a resolution on Palestine, which
was unanimously adopted by the 53 member countries of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) at its 32nd summit meeting in
Yaounde, Cameroon.
</P>
<P>
The resolution reiterated that the question of east Jerusalem
and Palestine is "at the center of the Arab-Israeli conflict."
</P>
<P>
"There can be no way to resolve the issue except that the
Israeli government returns east Jerusalem back to the Palestinian
national authority," decleared the resolution.
</P>
<P>
African leaders called for the continuation of the peace
process in the middle east, which has shown signs of being
stalled following the latest round of hostilities.
</P>
<P>
The OAU resolution urged for a solution of the problem of
Palestinian refugees and displaced persons "on the basis of the
principles of human rights."
</P>
<P>
The middle east peace process saw a breakthrough in 1994 with
the signing of the Oslo peace agreement. It was given another big
push in 1995, when Arafat was democratically elected the
Palestinian President.
</P>
<P>
However, measures of land confiscation, the expansion of
settlements, the non-release of captives and prisoners, the
slowing down of the retreat from Hebron on the part of the
Israeli government have all constituted the obstacles for
Palenstinian people's access to the peace divident, according to
a report submitted to the summit by the Palestinian delegation.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Former Governor Richard Lamm of
Colorado of the United States announced in Denver today that he
would seek the presidential nomination of Ross Perot's Reform
Party.
</P>
<P>
Lamm, 60, said he would campaign on a platform of restoring
fiscal sanity to Washington by dramatically controlling government
spending on social programs, including popular entitlement
programs like Medicare and Social Security, said news media
reports.
</P>
<P>
Lamm criticized both major political parties for what he said
were calculated, cowardly decisions to avoid tackling the nation's
major problems and instead passing on the bills to future
generations.
</P>
<P>
America "needs a whole decade of reform and renewal," Lamm was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Lamm is the first official candidate for the Reform Party
nomination. Meanwhile, Perot has said he will run if nominated by
Reform Party members, but it is unclear if he will actively seek
the nomination.
</P>
<P>
"I really want to create a whole new political coalition and
dedicate it to reform and renewal," Lamm told his audience at a
University of Denver library.
</P>
<P>
Lamm is realistic about his chances: little name recognition,
little money -- he's raised just 6,000 dollars so far -- and a
late start in campaign.
</P>
<P>
Perot and Lamm were the only potential candidates named in a
survey mailed this week to about 1 million Reform Party supporters
in order to determine which candidates will appear on the
nominating ballot at an August 11 party convention. Respondents
may write in other names.

<HEADLINE> Manuscript of a Novel by Mitterrand Auctioned in Paris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The manuscript of a novel written by
late French president Francois Mitterrand 56 years ago was
auctioned and sold for 38,000 francs (7,600 U.S. dollars) on
Wednesday at the Drouot hotel in Paris, the Liberation daily
reported today.
</P>
<P>
In this novel, entitled "First Agreement" and dated May 1940,
Mitterrand wrote about "the habits in the morning of Elsa and
Philippe during their brief love affair, with a little
sensuality,"according to auctioneer Me Loudmer.
</P>
<P>
"This is not bad for a writer who died not long ago,"said a
bookstore owner who abandoned after bidding for 25,000 francs.
Mitterrand died in January this year.
</P>
<P>
The name of the buyer is Gerard Oberle, and the name of the
former owner of the manuscript was kept secret, said Loudmer.
</P>
<P>
An expert in manuscripts of politicians said that judging from
all facts available, the book could have been in a family house
owned by Mitterrand in Jarnac, and had been stolen by someone.
</P>
<P>
The Liberation report said that the book, described as somewhat
erotic and sentimental by the French media, was written two years
after Mitterrand, then 23 years old, fell in love with a
15-year-old girl named Marie-Louise Terrasse, who later became a
television presenter.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Mitterrand once told journalist
Franz-Olivier Giesbert about this encounter: "As soon as I saw
her, I told myself,`She is the right one.' Although this sounds
banal or stupid, this was what happened."
</P>
<P>
In 1940, Mitterrand was serving in the French army as a
sergeant-chief waiting for a German offensive at the frontline. He
wrote daily to Marie whom he called "the wonderful face," and
the book was produced then, said the report.

<HEADLINE> Industrialization in Africa: A Mission Ambitious But Impending (part one) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 10 (Xinhua) -- For the first time, African
leaders gathered together to discuss industrialization in the
continent.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing 32nd Organization of African Unity (OAU) summit
meeting, held in the Cameroonian capital of Yaounde from July 8
to 10, moved to create the first ever alliance for Africa's
industrialization (AAI).
</P>
<P>
Industrialization in Africa?
</P>
<P>
Since 1980 when the OAU special economic summit adopted the
Lagos plan of action which raised the issue, the continent has
shown little progress in industrial development.
</P>
<P>
The contribution of the industrial sector to the gross
domestic product (gdp) has been declining and is below five
percent in many countries in the continent.
</P>
<P>
And with little industrial capacity, agricultural-oriented
Africa has for a long time been marginalized by the world
economic system.
</P>
<P>
"We still have to spend billions of Dollars every year to
import expensive industrial products with our limited pocket of
hard currency earned through the export of our cheap raw
materials," Vijay Makhan, OAU Deputy Secretary General in charge
of economic affairs who is attending the ongoing OAU summit, said
in an interview with Xinhua.

"That's why there is an emergency for industrialization for
Africa," said Makhan who is the vehementian advocator of economic
integration in Africa, and often saluted as "Mr. Aec" (African
Economic Community).
</P>
<P>
And now, Africa's industrialization campaign is high on the
agenda of the OAU summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
For most of the people, industrialization seems to be a dream
too ambitious to realize. But not for Mauricio Campos.
</P>
<P>
"While the challenges are unique, the opportunities are unique,
too," said the man who is the Director General of the United
Nations Industry Development Organization (UNIDO) and a major
designer of the alliance, also in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"We know that with backward infrastructure, limited financial
resources, little experience, the unfair world trade and
financial system, the challenges are enormous for the endeavor,"
said Campos.
</P>
<P>
He said after years of fight for national independence and
political unrest, Africa has at last entered a period of
political stability and economic recovery.

<HEADLINE> Industrialization in Africa: A Mission Ambitious But Impending (part two) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 10 (Xinhua) -- "That's the first sign to show
that the continent is faced with an unprecedented opportunity for
developing its industry capacity," said Campos.
</P>
<P>
The foreign investment rate in Africa, which is over 30
percent, is the highest in the world, according to a report
recently released by the United Nations Economic Committee for
Africa (ECA).
</P>
<P>
"There is an unique business opportunity to fill in the blanks
and invest into Africa's industrial sector, which is realized by
only very few developed nations," said Campos.
</P>
<P>
The UNIDO Chief said his organization, a major advocator of
the AAI, has made a long-term plan to build Africa's industrial
might.
</P>
<P>
"It is our goal that at least 50 percent of our budgeted
resources are directed to Africa in the next ten years," said
Campos.
</P>
<P>
"We have a new mandate to provide more effective assistance,
particularly to the least developed countries in Africa," he
explained.
</P>
<P>
The UNIDO Chief said despite the severe cuts in UNIDO's budget
for 1996-97 caused by the recently announced financial withdrawal
of the United States, UNIDO will pour into Africa another 70
million U.S. Dollars for industrial development.
</P>
<P>
He described the UNIDO's experiment in Cote d'Ivoire is "very
encouraging," adding two other countries, namely Ghana and
Cameroon, has accepted to cooperate with the U.N. body for
developing their industrial capacity.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement reached at the OAU summit meeting,
an all-Africa private sector forum, scheduled in the Ghanaian
capital of Accra later this year, is to work out detailed
guidance in the development of the AAI.
</P>
<P>
"We are waiting for good news from the Accra meeting," said
Campos.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the political will is there, the UNIDO Chief
gave a definite "yes".
</P>
<P>
He explained during the OAU Council of Ministers meeting which
ended last Saturday, and the ongoing OAU summit, he had acquired
wide-ranged moral support from the African leaders on the UNIDO
plan.
</P>
<P>
"The emergency has been fully realized by leaders of the
continent. But now there is a question: where can we mobilize
sufficient resources?" asked Campos.
</P>
<P>
Promising that his organization is "fully devoted" to the
African cause, he said more lobby work should be done in the
industrialized western world and its powerful financial
organizations.
</P>
<P>
"We must let them realize that the rest of the world will
benefit from the development of the African continent," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But first of all, it is an African affair. And it should be
done by ourselves," said Makhan, the Mr. Aec.
</P>
<P>
The African continent is bound with abundent industrial
resources which has for decades exploited by the western world.
But now, the Africans, in unity, decided to develop their own
industrial might.)
</P>
<P>
"Wish us good luck, and lend us your hand," said the OAU
Deputy Secretary General.
</P>
<P>
"African industrialization. An ambitious dream,
but a realistic one," he said.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Risk to Infants Can Be Cut, Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The risk of transmission of AIDS
from mother to child can be reduced to less than two percent,
according to reports from the 11th International AIDS Conference
held in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
"Advances in prevention of perinatal transmission offer new
hope for the world and for future generations," said Yvonne
Bryson, head of the department of pediatrics at Children's
Hospital in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 children are estimated to contract AIDS daily
worldwide, local reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Studies have shown that 38 percent of infected women transmit
the virus to babies in utero and that transmission depends largely
on the mother's viral load, the amount of virus in her body.
</P>
<P>
One study showed that giving women AZT can dramatically reduce
the infection rate to under 9 percent, Bryson said.
</P>
<P>
It is now believed that most children contract the AIDS virus
during the birthing process, particularly when the virus is
present in vaginal secretions.
</P>
<P>
Delivering babies by cesarean may reduce the risk of
transmission by half, she added.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Punjab Police to be Modernized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISALAMBAD, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto today directed the Punjab police to undertake a long-term
and massive computerization program.
</P>
<P>
Chairing a high-level meeting held in Lahore, the capital of
Punjab, the prime minister said information about officers,
prosecutors and magistrates should be entered into a reliable data
base.
</P>
<P>
She also insisted that the existing law banning the display of
weapons should be strictly implemented and no leniency be shown to
those violating it.
</P>
<P>
The meeting today made a number of decisions to expand and
modernize the police in Punjab province of Pakistan. A main
decision was a special allocation of 500 million rupees (14.3
million US dollars) to one billion rupees (28.6 million dollars)
for the police modernization, according to the Associated Press of
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Through a review of the law and order situation in Punjab, the
meeting took note of various incidents in the province in the
recent past and noted that there has been an increase in certain
types of crimes, such as murder, kidnapping, dacoity and robbery.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the meeting discussed the recent incidents of
bomb blasts in the province and agreed to make further efforts to
curb lawlessness and crimes.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Every Stipulation of Basic Law for HK SAR Must Be Fully Implemented: Spokesman (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The spokesman said that Article 23 of the Basic Law stipulates
that the Hong Kong SAR shall enact laws on its own, to prohibit
any act of treason, secession, sedition and subversion against the
Central People's Government, or theft of state secrets.
</P>
<P>
This completely belongs to China's sovereign affairs. The
Chinese side's desire to consult with the British side on this
issue totally proceeds from its good aspirations for Sino-British
cooperation, to benefit the smooth transition of power in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Security Secretary's remarks made at a time when progress
has been made in exchanging views on issues concerning the
localization of the Official Secrets Act, and the adaptation of
Hong Kong law, once again show that the British side lacks
sincerity for cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman particularly mentioned that what the Hong Kong
government official has said demonstrates that there is no doubt
that the British side has placed the "Human Rights Bill" above
Hong Kong's existing laws, which of course violates the Basic Law,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said that the British side still clings
obstinately to their course, even they know that the laws to be
revised in accordance with the "Human Rights Bill" will violate
the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
This is an attitude extremely irresponsible for the future of
Hong Kong, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is seriously concerned about the British
side's disruptive actions to the normal work of the Sino-British
Joint Liaison Group.
</P>
<P>
"We once again demand that the British side earnestly bear
responsibilities toward the Joint Declaration, to strengthen
cooperation with the Chinese side for Hong Kong's smooth
transition," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the spokesman said that every stipulation of the
Basic Law should be completely implemented.
</P>
<P>
Any disruptions and obstacles created before 1997 to prevent
the Hong Kong SAR from implementing the Basic Law will be
eliminated, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> China Investigates Japan War Software </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, July 10 (Xinhua) -- China is investigating the
production of unauthorized software for a computer game that
features battles between Japan and allied troops during World War
II.
</P>
<P>
Four Chinese workers at the Japanese-funded Tianjin Koei
Company, in the port city of Tianjin, claim they were threatened
with dismissal soon after they refused to develop "Final Decision
of the Governor," an allegedly offensive computer game that
depicts a battle in the Pacific region between Japan, China and
the United States during the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
"War criminals who were responsible for the death of many
Chinese people were characterized as generals in the software
program, which is unacceptable to us," said Liang Guangming, one
of the four workers.
</P>
<P>
About 35 million Chinese people were killed or wounded during
the war, and the economic losses for China reached 560 billion US
dollars, according to an official document compiled in China in
the late 1940s.
</P>
<P>
He said the software's images and text contain representations
of Japanese planes and ships used during the war, and also
Japanese officers, including chief war criminal Hideki
Tojo. Hideki was hanged by the Far East military tribunal soon
after the war, as one of the leaders of the Japanese War of
Aggression against China (1937-1945).
</P>
<P>
An investigation of the company was conducted on July 5 by Ma
Jie, an official with the Press and Publication Bureau of Tianjin
municipal government, and his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
He said the Japanese firm violated China's Provision on
Electronics Publication, which was issued in April this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the 22nd article of the provision, publishers and
producers are not allowed to produce electronics publications
entrusted by overseas organizations, before the contents of the
materials for publication are submitted for approval to the
provincial press and publications bureau.
</P>
<P>
The company has never asked local government departments for
permission to produce the software, the official said, and the
production must stop.
</P>
<P>
He said that the company has transferred to Japan all of the
images and text used in the software production, and the local
government has ordered the company to submit an explanation of the
games' contents.
</P>
<P>
As part of the investigation, the local government also ordered
the company to turn over the original material.
</P>
<P>
The Tianjin Koei Co. apologized on July 9 for the "mistake,"
and pledged to never repeat it in a written document given to
local press and publication bureau by the company's Japanese
manager and a deputy manager.
</P>
<P>
In the written apology, company officials said their business
showed a lack of consideration for the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The company ceased production of the software on July 3, and
sent the production materials to Japan.
</P>
<P>
The software is said to have offended some people in Shanghai
when it entered the city last year.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the local government, three college students
there demanded an investigation into the import of the software.
</P>
<P>
An investigation by local experts revealed the software can be
misleading about the results of the war, and that it also
advocates militarism. They have demanded the recall of
the "offending" software.

<HEADLINE> Dry Yellow River Sets New Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Experts are predicting that
China's mighty Yellow River could soon become a "part time
waterway".
</P>
<P>
Their fears were voiced after the river set a new record - for
being totally dry in its lower reaches for 128 days, with new
records being set daily as the dry spell continues.
</P>
<P>
To date the stoppage of any river flow in the Yellow River has
set a new record, and is still continuing, according to a report
by the Lijin Station, the last hydrometric station on the lower
reaches of the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
Since the first dry-river spell in 1972, the situation in the
lower reaches of the Yellow River has been deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
During the 1990-1995 period, the stoppage of the river's flow
occurred 18 times at the section of Lijin Station, with the total
stoppage time of flow reaching 333 days.
</P>
<P>
Then in 1995, the stoppage time reached 122 days, from March 4
to July 22, the first time in history it exceeded 100 days.
</P>
<P>
The length of flow stoppages have been extending, with the
longest length of dry river in the lower reaches of the Yellow
River reaching 588 km, accounting for 70 percent of the lower
reaches of the river.
</P>
<P>
The dry river problem could be attributed primarily to the
reducing sources of the watercourse, and the increasing
utilization of water.
</P>
<P>
As well as 20 billion cubic meters of water washing away silt,
the lower reaches of the river provided only 37 billion cubic
meter of water for utilization, while the annual usage of water
from the river had been topping 31 billion cubic meters since the
late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that the drought which hit both sides of the
Yellow River this spring is another major factor resulting in this
year's record dry river bed.
</P>
<P>
As the main surface water source of north China, the Yellow
River is of great significance for farming and industrial
production in the region. The longer the stoppage of flow becomes,
the greater the damage will be to agriculture and industry.
</P>
<P>
Will the Yellow River, which for generations has nourished the
Chinese nation, become a seasonal river?
</P>
<P>
Experts in China believe that the damage brought about by the
stoppage of flow in the mighty river could be greatly reduced,
provided that the utilization of water from the river is
reasonably controlled.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Mayor Delays Decision on Taxi Fare Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 10 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Atlanta Mayor Bill Cambell on
Tuesday delayed announcing his decision on a proposed Olympic
fare hike for taxicabs.
</P>
<P>
The mayor's options were to sign it, veto it or let it take
effect without his signature.
</P>
<P>
The rate hike, approved last week by Atlanta Council, would
raise fares for one passenger from the airport to downtwon from
18 dollars to 22. Two would pay 24 dollars and a party of
three would pay 30.
</P>
<P>
Fares would revert to normal August 31, after the Olympics and
Paralympics.
</P>
<P>
Campell has complained that raising the fares just for the
Olympics amounted to gouging Olympic visitors, thus sending a
negative message about the city.

<HEADLINE> Kidnappers Held In Joint Chinese-UK Police Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, July 10 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese gang of kidnappers have
been arrested, and their victim freed, after an amazing police
operation that spanned two continents.
</P>
<P>
The hostage was safely freed unhurt, and seven robbers caught,
thanks to co-operation between police in east China's Fujian and
police counterparts in Britain.
</P>
<P>
On June 22, Cao Xiaoming, a citizen of Fujian, was kidnapped
while he was in London. His friends reported the case to British
police the following day.
</P>
<P>
Three days later police in Fujian received information about
the incident from both London, and China's Public Security
Ministry. After an immediate investigation they confirmed that
Chen Pinzhu, wife of the hostage, had received a call from London
on June 22 demanding a 500,000 yuan ransom.
</P>
<P>
On June 30, two police officers from London arrived in Fujian,
together with senior officers from the ministry. The two parties
worked with local police to solve the case.
</P>
<P>
At 6 pm, July 4, a special investigation team working on the
case caught Tang Muyan and Zhao Shanwang red-handed, at the foot
of Qingzhisi Hill, Guantou Township, Lianjiang County,
Fujian. The two were accomplices of the London kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, police in Fujian dispatched news of their movements
to their counterparts at Scotland Yard, who immediately launched
six simultaneous raids, rescued the hostage and captured five
kidnappers, all overseas Chinese.

companies, women's beauty parlors and other places.
</P>
<P>
The convicts are identified as Mohammad Mohammadi, Reza

raping and other crimes.
</P>
<P>
This is part of the nationwide efforts to severely punish
criminals. Iran Tuesday officially enshrined a tough new penal
code based on the Islamic law.
</P>
<P>
The new text allows a more effective campaign against all
sorts of corruption, theft as well as public order offenses.

ANKARA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- A large quantity of hashish and
heroin were seized in different parts of Turkey in recent days,
the Anatolia News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official agency said that Narcotics Team of Diyarbakir
Gendarmerie has seized three tons of hashish in towns of Lice,
Hani and Kulp in Diyarbakir, southeastern Turkey, within one week.

<HEADLINE> Iran Claims to Arrest "King of Hashish" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran claimed here today it has
arrested the "king of hashish" who sells and delivers large
amount of narcotics in the capital of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Major-General Yousef-Reza Abulfathi, commander of the Greater
Tehran Law Enforcement Agency, said, "We had been searching for a
long time for the members of the gang who distributed hashish
among the youth in Tehran."
</P>
<P>
The Persian evening paper Resalate reported that the anti-
narcotics agents managed to arrest the chief of the gang after 45
days of continuous hard searches.
</P>
<P>
However, the report did not give the specific amount of
narcotics the gang had sold or delivered, nor did it give any
personal background of the "king of hashish."
</P>
<P>
It said that the arrest of the leading person led to the arrest
of another 45 members of the gang and the capture of two tons of
narcotics, including hashish, heroin and morphine.
</P>
<P>
Iran announced late June that it confiscated 170 tons of
narcotics in the last Iranian calendar year ending on March 19.
</P>
<P>
The drug issue is regarded as one of the main social problems
of the country since it is one of the best transit for drug to
Europe and is close to the "golden crescent" in the border area
between Afghanistan and Pakistan, one of the biggest drug-
producing center in the world.
</P>
<P>
Iran passed a strict anti-drug law in 1989, which empowered
the Iranian authorities to execute the smugglers who were caught
with more than 30 grams of heroine or five kilograms of opium.
</P>
<P>
According to an early report, Iran executed over 4,000 drug
traffickers since 1988 and there are over 12,500 foreign
smugglers in the Iranian jails.

ATLANTA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Olympic officials are keeping a
track of Hurricane Bertha although it has a slim chance to hit
Savannah, the site for the Olympic yatching competitions.
</P>
<P>
"We're waiting for it to make a swing before making any major
decision," said Steven Grote, an Olympics press officer in
Savannah. "When it makes a move, we'll make a decision."
</P>
<P>
Hurricane Bertha is not expected to hit Savannah, according to
the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
"The chances of it making a landfall near Savannah are becoming
less likely," said hurricane meteorologist Mike Hopkins. "It may
generate some strong swell and they'll probably get some swell of
it."
</P>
<P>
The Olympic yachting venues have experience for
hurricane. Last year, facilities withstood 10-feet swells spawned
by Hurricane Erin, which hit the coast along the Gulf of Mexicao

<HEADLINE> Best Kenyan Runners Could Miss Olympic Boat, Agents </HEADLINE>

ATLANTA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Kenya moved closer to naming
replacement runners for its powerful distance lineup after agents
for current team members indicated their athletes would not arrive
in Hattiesburg of Mississippi for training camp before a Thursday
deadline, according to reports here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Three representatives from the Kenyan government, as well the
track federation, are in London with visas and accreditation for
the 26 Olympic runners competing on the lucrative European
circuit. The runners include steeplechase gold medal favorite
Moses Kiptanui and defending 800-meter Olympic champion William
Tanui.
</P>
<P>
If they fail to show, 24 other runners, who have been
designated as Olympic team alternates, are prepared to come to
Mississippi, the Altanta Journal-Constitution quoted team leader
Kip Keino as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We may not win a medal, but we will participate with a team
that wants to be here," Keino said.
</P>
<P>
Keino spoke Tuesday with British agent Kim McDonald, who said
several of the Kenyan Olympians would run in London on Friday and
would not be in Mississippi before Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Italian agent Gianni Demadonna told Keino that a dozen athletes
he represented would arrive in Atlanta on July 21.
</P>
<P>
Keino said that the agents had exhausted the runners and
undermined the team by having them compete in two to four meets in
Europe before the Olympics.

<P>
CAIRO, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Secretary-General
Esmat Abdul-Meguid said here today that Israel must withdraw from
all occupied Arab land for realizing comprehensive and balanced
peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference with Henry Siegman, director of the
U.S./Middle East Project of the Council on Foreign Relations in
New York, Abdul-Meguid said that the Israelis should understand
the Arabs' insistence on the Israeli withdrawal from Palestinian
territories, Syrian Golan Heights and south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"If Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sees that he can
go ahead with the Mideast peace process while Israel is still
occupying part of Arab territories, it is a wrong perception," the
Arab League chief said.
</P>
<P>
The Arabs can never accept the occupation of their territories
whatever the Israeli security considerations are, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Israel's security considerations could destroy
peace.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has said that Israel would not withdraw from the
Golan because the strategic plateau is too important to his
country's security.
</P>

Abdul-Meguid and Siegman co-chaired a two-day seminar on
Arab-U.S. relations here Monday and Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Every Stipulation of Basic Law for HK SAR Must Be Fully Implemented: Spokesman (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the Hong Kong and
Macao Affairs Office of the State Council has reaffirmed that any
laws and regulations violating the Basic Law for the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region cannot be used as laws for the Hong
Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, the spokesman stressed that the
relevant stipulations of the Basic Law on banning political
activities conducted by foreign political organizations, or groups
in the Hong Kong SAR, and on banning the establishment of ties
between political organizations or groups of the Hong Kong SAR and
their counterparts of foreign countries, must be implemented
through enacting laws by the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
On July 5, the Security Secretary of the Hong Kong government
claimed, at an Information Policy Panel meeting of the Legislative
Council, that if China and Britain cannot reach a consensus before
1997 on the legislation on the act of treason, secession,
sedition, subversion against the Central People's government, or
theft of state secrets, the British side will unilaterally
announce the progress for negotiations, and its draft laws
submitted to the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group for discussion.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong government official also claimed that the Basic
Law prohibits political organizations, or groups of the Hong Kong
SAR, to establish ties with their counterparts of foreign
countries, but according to the "Human Rights Bill", the relevant
stipulations have been deleted by the Society Ordinance, so there
is no reason to correct them.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on the above-mentioned issue, the
spokesman said that what the high-ranking official of the Hong
Kong government has said is a threat to the Chinese side, and also
a disruption to the work of the Sino-British Joint Liaison
Group.

<P>
-- A Fed study outlines a new approach to monetary policy that
may shed light on the Fed's recent decision to stand pat on
interest rates. The theory, "opportunistic disinflation," holds
that when inflation is low, policy makers should wait for
recessions to make further progress against it, rather than
steadily chipping away. The policy suggests the Fed might
tolerate higher inflation, within limits.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Key Mindanao leaders on Wednesday
expressed their support for the Philippine government's peace and
development program in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
This was contained in a resolution signed by at least 29
governors, vice governors, mayors and congressmen in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was presented to President Fidel Ramos today
during his meeting with local officials and several cabinet
members on the issue of the Southern Philippines Council for Peace
and Development (SPCPD).
</P>
<P>
On receiving the resolution of support, Ramos said he was glad
to see in the gathering the real leadership for peace in Mindanao
that would collectively carry on the tasks of political stability,
poverty alleviation and social cohesion.
</P>
<P>
The president insisted that the majority of the people in
Mindanao are supportive of the government's peace plan with the
Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF).
</P>
<P>
The government has reached an agreement with MNLF to set up
SPCPD as a transitory body, which will oversee the peace and
development in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
But this was opposed by Catholic residents in Mindanao as they
fear that they will be under the control of MNLF.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Reports Normal Economic Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- China's capital, Beijing reported
a normal economic operation, and scored a substantial decrease in
the range of price increases in the first half of this year, a
senior official announced today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Beijing
Municipal People's Congress, Yuan Zhenyu, director of the
Municipal Planning Commission, said that Beijing's gross domestic
product -- the value of goods and services produced -- amounted to
64.58 billion yuan during the January-June period, up 9.3 percent
from the same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The government has taken effective measures to curb
the excessive prices of commodities and services. As a result,
retail prices rose 8.7 percent in the first half of this year,
down 4.5 percentage points from the same period a year ago."

economic growth from January through June:

<HEADLINE> Naval Port Area Partially Open to Foreigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, July 10 (Xinhua) -- China announced today it will open
part of the northern coastal area of Lushunkou, a major naval base
known as Port Arthur, that has been closed to the outside world
for 41 years.
</P>
<P>
A total of 233 square kilometers in northwest Lushunkou is no
longer included in the restricted military zone of the area,
according to a decision by the central authorities.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners now have free access to the opened area, but entry
into the southeast part of Lushunkou, where the restriction
remains, is still not allowed, said the announcement.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said that the Chinese government may open to
foreign vessels the Bohai Sea route, which links the port to the
Shandong Province. They said final approval is expected soon.
</P>
<P>
Lushunkou is a district of Dalian in the industrial province of
Liaoning.
</P>
<P>
The partial opening of the area symbolizes a further step in
China's opening-up process, that has already brought about rapid
economic growth in the eastern coastal region, observers said.
</P>
<P>
The history of Lushunkou as a naval port dates from early 18th
century, when the Qing Dynasty vowed to build a powerful navy
force there. By 1890, it had developed into one of the world's
five largest naval ports.
</P>
<P>
With its strategic location, Lushunkou was a major battlefield
during the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895 and the Japanese-Russian
War early this century. The port was occupied by Russia from
1895-1904, and then by Japan for the next 40 years.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1950s, China has been upgrading the port to a modern
naval base. Two former Chinese Navy commanders were trained at
the base, and a number of long-distance missile tests were
successfully conducted by nuclear-powered submarines.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that the partial opening of Lushunkou today
represents a historic change in contrast to foreigners' military
invasions a century ago, and reflects both an increase in China's
national strength and the trend of opening to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Lushunkou, with a population of 210,000, has an annual gross
domestic product of 2.6 billion yuan. Economists believe that the
port area has fine prospects for economic development, as it is
equipped with sound infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said that they will strive to attract
international capital, and will invite foreign investors to launch
businesses in fields such as agriculture, aquatic production,
tourism and port development.
</P>
<P>
A group of Japanese officials and entrepreneurs will soon
arrive in the newly-opened area to explore business opportunities,
local officials said.

SINGAPORE, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's Senior Minister Lee
Kuan Yew said today that the country's success has been built on a
harmonious, cohesive and productive society.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to employers on the challenges facing them in the 21st
century, Lee said that employers and workers are key to this
success but most importantly, society must be at peace with
itself.
</P>
<P>
He noted that close tripartite cooperation between the
government, employers and the unions has helped build Singapore's
success.
</P>
<P>
He said how well Singapore does depends on "how many
entrepreneurs or wealth creators we have in our midst."
</P>
<P>
The challenges facing employers are how to maintain this
cooperation with workers and the government, especially to make
sure Singapore stay relevant to the world, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Addressing concerns about rising costs in Singapore, Lee said
while Singapore's costs are higher than the neighboring countries,
it has a lead in terms of value added per worker.
</P>
<P>
He added that employers must make adjustments for an aging work
force.

<HEADLINE> One Killed, Two Injuried in Olympic Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The electric shock, set off when a
pair of air conditioning cables fell across power lines, killed
one worker and injuried other two in the Centennial Olympic Park
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Two roofers working atop a burned-out, three-story trangular
building at the corner of Techwood and Nassau streets were
appearently cleaning up the roof Tuesday morning, said Atlanta
Fire Department spokesman Tim Szymanski.
</P>
<P>
One of them picked up a set of air-conditioning cables and
dropped the loose ends, including copper tubing, off the
roof. They fell across power lines running near the building.
</P>
<P>
The resulting explosion set roofer Scott Dawson's clothing
afire briefly. His boss, Emory Brown, owner of Brown's Roofing
Service, fell to the roof with the wires above him.
</P>
<P>
Police and fierefighters worked on Dawson, 30, for more than
half an hour, finally taking him off the roof with a cherry picker
while still pumping his chest, but he was pronounced dead at 9:56
a.m., Szymanski said.
</P>
<P>
Brown, 52, was freed when power to the lines was cut. He was
taken to a nearby hospital, where he was listed in stable
condition in the burn unit, according to Szymanski.
</P>
<P>
The third roofer suffered minor injuries, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
When they heard the explosion and screams, most of the hundreds
of construction workers around the park knew without looking what
had happened.
</P>
<P>
"It sounded like a clap of thunder," said carpenter Darrel
Robinson. "I've been doing this long enough to know someone's been
electrocuted."
</P>
<P>
They were working on a building gutted by a two-alarm fire in
August. Robinson said workers are tying to get the building ready
to house a gift shop by next week.
</P>
<P>
Dawson's death, said construction hand Charlie Lambert, was a
tragic but routine construction accident.
</P>
<P>
"You stop paying attention for just one minute and it'll get
you dead," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Foreign air carriers that operate
routes to China must submit plans detailing their civil aviation
security to Chinese authorities, in accordance with air safety
regulations issued here today.
</P>
<P>
The civil aviation security regulations, signed by Premier Li
Peng, went into effect July 6. They include six chapters and 40
articles.
</P>
<P>
The first chapter, with eight articles, lists general
principles. It says the regulations are applicable to all civil
aviation activities within the border of the People's Republic of
China, and to all units and individuals involved in those
activities.
</P>
<P>
The first chapter also requires that all those entering the
airport must obey the laws and regulations for civil aviation, and
lists measures that operators of airports and airplanes must take
to ensure security.
</P>
<P>
The second through fourth chapters stipulate security
requirements for airports during ticket sales and baggage
consignment, on-board activities, and security checks.
</P>
<P>
According to the articles, airports cannot open for service
until they meet requirements for security personnel, airport
layout, firefighting and security facilities, and emergency
equipment.
</P>
<P>
The regulations stipulate a crew commander is required to be in
charge of on-board security to ensure flight safety, and crew
members must assist the commander to control behaviors that might
obstruct the normal flight process.
</P>
<P>
The fifth chapter lists punishments for behaviors that go
against the regulations. Fines for units and individuals will not
exceed 50,000 yuan and 5,000 respectively, and violators will be
held legally responsible for their actions.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Ivan Ivankov, who formed the
backbone of the Belarus gymnastic team along with the 1992 Olympic
six-time gold medal winner Vitaly Scherbo, has been forced out of
the Atlanta Olympic Games by a torn Achilles tendon sustained in
training, according to reports from Cartersville on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The injury and operation occurred last week, after Ivankov
collapsed while training at the Cartersville Gymnastics Center.
</P>
<P>
Ivankov was the second strongest performer of a Belarus team
expected to contend for an Olympic medal. At the 1996 world
championships in Puerto Rico, he finished in the top seven in
floor exercise, pommel horse, rings and parallel bars events.
</P>
<P>
Ivankov will be replaced by Alexiei Sinkeich, 18, who has
limited international experience, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
"We had done a couple diagnostic procedures at the office and
felt we had a pretty good grasp what his condition was," said Dr.
Allan Atwell, the Cartersville sports medicine specialist who
treated Ivankov during the first stages of the tendon
problem. "But we also were aware of what the potential for injury
was, too."
</P>
<P>
Invankov had determined to resume training, whithdrawing from
vault and floor exercise when he returned to the gym. But no
sooner had he taken the floor when his right Achilles ruptured.
The injury was not the results of trauma but from a two-year
chronic weakening of the tendon.

KAMPALA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- A new 22-member Interim Executive
Council (IEC) has been formed within the largest opposition
Uganda People's Congress (UPC) while the UPC president's new
appointment was rejected.
</P>
<P>
UPC President Milton Obote appointed James Rwanyarare as
chairman of the Pesidential Policy Commission (PPC) to replace
Ceilia Ogwal last weekend.
</P>
<P>
But yesterday, Ogwal said, after a day-long closed-door
meeting with her supporters, "The party's national task force
(NTF) rejected the party president's decision to remove certain
leaders from leadership," local newspaper "The New Vision "
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The ICE, headed by Ogwal, will report the NTF "about it's
application under the current political situation" within a month
from yesterday, said Ogwal.
</P>
<P>
"The problem we had with the PPC was that there were members
who sat on it but did not know what was happening at their own
homes", she said, adding that the grave situation in the party
headquarters was caused by pronouncements from Obote in exile.
</P>
<P>
Obote ordered the party members not to take part in recent
parliament elections, but Ogwal contested and won a seat.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Foreign Trade Firms Benefit from Export Insurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Two Chinese foreign trade firms
have become the first beneficiaries of China's medium and
long-term export credit insurance.
</P>
<P>
China Engineering and Agricultural Machinery Import and Export
Company, and China Chemical Import and Export Company, have
received about 770,000 US dollars from the People's Insurance
Company of China, the country's top insurance underwriter.
</P>
<P>
The two firms exported agricultural machinery to Cuba in
1993. Due to severe economic problems, the country has failed to
pay on time, said a PICC official.
</P>
<P>
To ensure normal operations at the two firms, PICC immediately
transfered money to them from the State Risk Fund, according to
the export credit insurance agreement, and is seeking the return
of the payment through diplomatic channels.
</P>
<P>
Medium and long-term export credit insurance is a service PICC
undertakes for the government to support and encourage exports of
set equipment, machinery and electronic products, aircraft, ships,
and to help Chinese enterprises take part in international bidding
and investments.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993 PICC has reached agreement to provide export credit
insurance for 58 projects, and formally offered coverage to 19
major projects valued at 450 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
More Chinese foreign trade firms have started to use export
credit insurance to boost their business. PICC has tried to
promote more medium and long-term services, and has expanded its
business from west Europe, north America, Japan to southeast Asia,
east Europe, Latin America and Africa.

<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
stressed here today that the Chinese Communist Party and the
Chinese government would continue to make unremitting efforts to
consolidate and develop Sino-DPRK friendship.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Kim Yun Hyok, vice-premier of the
Administration Council of Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK), Jiang said China attaches importance to Sino-DPRK
friendship.
</P>
<P>
Jiang extended a welcome to the Vice-Premier, who is leading a
delegation to China to participate in celebrations marking the
35th anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Korea Treaty of
Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance.
</P>
<P>
The Treaty, Jiang said, embodied the friendship of the peoples
of China and DPRK.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of visit of delegations of the two countries to
jointly celebrate the occasion, also demonstrated that the parties
and the governments of the two countries all attach high
importance to the friendship between the two countries, Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
Luo Gan, State Councillor and Secretary-General of the State
Council left for DPRK this morning.
</P>
<P>
Kim Yun Hyok conveyed Kim Jong Il's regards to President
Jiang. He said he fully agreed with assessment of the Chinese side
on the Treaty signed 35 years ago, which he described as a
historical document. The treaty has played an important role in
promoting bilateral relations, and in maintaining regional peace
and stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
The strengthening of friendship with China is a consistent
stand of the Korean Party and the government, as well as the wish
of the late leader Kim Il Sung. Kim Yun Hyok also thanked the
Chinese government for its aid to his country to help get over an
economically difficult period.
</P>
<P>
Jiang asked the Vice-Premier to convey his regards to Kim Jong
Il, and briefed the Korean guests on the theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics, and the build-up of

<HEADLINE> Pakistan President Calls for Structural Adjustment in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The potential of Pakistan's
cotton and textile industry could be fully realized by making
necessary structural adjustments, said Pakistani President Farooq
Leghari today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a local function in the southern port city of
Karachi, the president said that Pakistan has to consistently
improve productivity, product quality, value addition and
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Besides adopting modern technology, the president said, major
stress has to be laid on human resources and skill development as
they are the most fundamental factors in sustaining continuous
development of textile industry.
</P>
<P>
The president said that a market-to-market strategy and
product-to-product segment approach have to be designed to expand
the market base and motivate investors towards value addition.
</P>
<P>
Though Pakistan is the fourth largest producer of cotton in the
world, its total share in the world textile exports is less than
two percent, and that mainly consists of low-priced fabric and
yarn which have very little value addition, he said.
</P>
<P>
Such a sorry state of the textile sector clearly shows that
manipulation of terms of trade in favor of one sector at the cost
of another is no longer possible nor advisable, the president
said.
</P>
<P>
The role of the government, he emphasized, is to correct
imbalances and distortion in price structure and not to manipulate
it for one sector of the economy at the cost of another.
</P>
<P>
The president said the predominance of cotton in the national
economy is so strong that success or failure of cotton crop in a
year can easily add or subtract two to three percent in the
country's overall economic growth rate.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the country's ability to speed up overall economic
development will mainly depend on its ability to fully realize the
true potential of cotton production and cotton-based industries.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Li Lanqing has urged
foreign trade sectors to broaden their horizons and make
down-to-earth progress.
</P>
<P>
He told a national foreign trade export working conference,
which opened today in Beijing, that the foreign trade sector must
change the modes of both development and management, increase
exports and strengthen competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
He urged the sector to attach great importance to the export of
complete sets of machinery and electronic equipment, and
strengthen the management of foreign trade enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade directly faces the intensely competitive
international market, where economic returns co-exist with risks,
he said, thus foreign trade enterprises must operate in line with
international practice. They can then make economic gains only
through strict management, and highly efficient operations.
</P>
<P>
The government will map out corresponding financial, industrial
and capital management policies with reference to international
practice, to encourage the development of a diverse foreign trade
market, he said.
</P>
<P>
Banks will give support to foreign trade enterprises with
markets and good economic returns in terms of loans, he
said.

LAGOS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- About 20 armed robbers at the
weekend invaded the home for the disabled in Ibadan, capital of
the western Oyo State, carting away property and raping a
15-year-old female inmate in an operation, the daily Champion
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The hoodlums stormed the Oluyole Cheshire home for the
handicapped on Poly road around 11:30pm on Friday, beating and
harassing the inmates, many of them on wheelchairs.
</P>
<P>
An eye witness was quoted as saying that the attack, which was
the fifth in six months, left some of the inmates gasping for
breath and the raped teenager bleeding.
</P>
<P>
Matron of the home Tinu Jaya said the hoodlums had been
unleashing terror on the home, the inmates and the workers who
are usually helpless to defend themselves or repulse the attacks.
</P>
<P>
She said the robbers, mostly youths, came in around 11:30 in
the night in a bus, forcefully gaining entry after capturing the
two securitymen at the gate. The robbers made straight to the
inmates lodge and the Matron's house where thousands of Naira
were stolen and the inmates maltreated.
</P>
<P>
"The most painful aspect of the whole thing was the case of
the 15-year-old girl with me who was raped while others were
being harassed and assaulted," Jaya said.
</P>
<P>
According to her, a securityman who escaped by jumping over
the fence while the operation lasted alerted the police on patrol
nearby.
</P>
<P>
"On sighting the police, the robbers shot at them. They first
made for their bus but on sensing that the police would catch up
with them, they jumped out of the bus and escaped into the nearby
bush," Jaya stated.

<HEADLINE> Asian Economies Seek to Penetrate European Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Senior trade officials and experts
from 19 Asian and Pacific economies began a three-day seminar here
today to strengthen their efforts to penetrate the European Union
(EU) markets more effectively.
</P>
<P>
The seminar will make an assessment of the challenges and
opportunities for trade between Asia and the EU against the
backdrop of the accelerated pace of the single European market,
the European economic area, the EU's agreements with countries in
eastern Europe, the move towards a common European currency and
other "Eurocentric" trends.
</P>
<P>
The seminar will in particular review opportunities and
barriers in some "sensitive" sectors, such as textiles and
apparel, electrical goods and electronics, leather and leather
products, primary and intermediate products, and financial
services.
</P>
<P>
The seminar is expected to contribute to a better understanding
of the mechanics of economic integration in Europe and its
implications for developing economies in the Asia-Pacific region,
as well as how strategic perspectives can be better translated
into ways Asians and Europeans conduct their trade, and what
should be done to convert their many tactical achievements into
mutually supportive trade policies and regimes.
</P>
<P>
In his opening statement, Adrianus Mooy, executive secretary of
the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the
Pacific (ESCAP), said it is imperative for developing economies to
have a proper understanding of the nature and implications of
regional agreements, so as to meet the challenges the agreements
pose, and to take advantage of the opportunities they offer.
</P>
<P>
He said, "for many developing countries, the single greatest
threat is being excluded from any process of deep integration
among the developed countries, such as the single European market.
The cost and benefit for non-Europeans are not so easy to grasp,
especially at this very early stage."
</P>
<P>
He added it is clear that developing Asian economies' access to
the single European market will largely depend on their ability to
adapt to the changing trading environment, and whether the
unification of Europe will be accompanied by the easing of trade
barrier for non-Europe.
</P>
<P>
The seminar is one in a series of activities organized by ESCAP
to help developing economies in the region to deal with the
implications of major "large economic spaces."

<HEADLINE> Digital Technology For Chinese Surveying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Digital technology has been widely
applied to surveying and mapping wetlands in northeast China's
Heilongjiang Province and for a geographic information system for
provincial wetland resource management, according to the State
Bureau of Surveying and Mapping.
</P>
<P>
The project, "the application of digital surveying and mapping
technology to wetland research", was the work of the Heilongjiang
Surveying and Mapping Bureau, and involved Prof. Lu Jianjian, a

technology, the researchers were able, in four years, to survey
and map the wetland resources of the whole province.
</P>
<P>
The wetlands management geographic information system consists
of classified statistics, various kinds of statistical charts, and
diagrams that provide a scientific basis for the protection and
development of the province's wetland resources.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets Japanese Sakigake Party Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
today that China's consistent policy is to develop a "long-term,
stable and all-round cooperative relationship" with Japan.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the statement at a meeting with Takemura Masayoshi,
leader of Japan's Sakigake (Pioneer Party).
</P>
<P>
The Sakigake Party, and all other political parties in Japan,
should contribute to healthy Sino-Japanese relations facing the
21st century, the President urged.
</P>
<P>
"Past experience, if not forgotten, will be a guide for the
future", Jiang said, adding that the peoples of the two countries
should be friendly with each other from generation to generation,
and that younger generation politicians of the two countries are
duty-bound to contribute to the consolidation and development of
healthy bilateral relations.

The basis of the Sino-Japanese good neighborhood relations is
the Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration and the Sino-Japanese Peace
and Friendship Treaty, Jiang stressed. He noted that the
maintenance of contact and dialogue between leaders of the two
countries, the rapid development of economic ties, as well as the
active cooperation in other fields, would be conducive to the

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Campaign Against AIDS Pays Off in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(By Cai Guozhong)
</P>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's campaign against AIDS
disease has paid off in recent years.
</P>
<P>
There is a noticeable decline in the rate at which people are
getting infected with HIV at six antenatal clinics around the
country, according to a latest report from the country's Ministry
of Health.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the rate of HIV-positive for antenatal clinic
attendees in Nsambya hospital of Kampala dropped from 26.2
percent in 1990/93 to 12.5 percent in 1994/95, while in Jinja
hospital near Kampala, the rate declined from 15.2 percent to 9.6
percent in the same period.
</P>
<P>
The figure in Mbale hospital, 200 kilometers northeast of
Kampala, dropped from 13.7 percent in 1990/93 to 8.2 percent in
1994/95.
</P>
<P>
In Tororo hospital and Barara hospital around the capital, the
rates also registered a similar decline, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In short, in a number of Ugandan towns, nearly 30 percent of
women attending antenatal clinics showed HIV-positive four years
ago, and now the percentage has fallen to between 15 and 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is one of the countries worst hit by AIDS in the world.
The disease was first detected in the southwestern Rakai district
in 1982. Since then there have been AIDS case reports in all 39
districts in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Most experts, however, agree that HIV infection has been
around since the late seventies. Of the sexually-active
population in Rakai, 12 percent were found to be HIV-positive in
1988. That figure now stands at 10 percent. However HIV infection
is still rife in Kampala, with rates of more than one in five
among pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that up to now about 7.7 percent of the
country's 19.3 million people is infected with HIV, that is 1.5
million. The figure is expected to rise to 2 million by the year
2,000.
</P>
<P>
According to the report issued by the Health Ministry
recently, the HIV infection prevalence rates are decreasing in
urban areas but still increasing in rural areas at present.
</P>
<P>
As for AIDS cases throughout the country, which are mostly
developed from HIV-1, a cumulative total of 46,120 cases
(including children and adults) had, up to December 31, 1994,
been reported to the STD-AIDS control program of the ministry.
However, the figure for 1993 is 42,000.
</P>
<P>
HIV-1 is the AIDS virus commonly found in Uganda and in east
and southern African countries. People with HIV-1 virus survive
for about 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The number of Ugandans who died of AIDS has increased from
41,000 in 1991 to over 100,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
Since the deadly AIDS monster is not only a health problem,
but also a serious social problem, the Ugandan government has
paid much attention to prevention and control of the disease, but
it has no cure in the world.
</P>
<P>
In a campaign against AIDS, the Ugandan government announced a
5-point policy on AIDS at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
They are:
</P>
<P>
1. Stop the spread of HIV infection.
</P>
<P>
2. Mitigate the adverse health and socio-economic impact of
the HIV-AIDS epidemic.
</P>
<P>
3. Strengthen the national capacity to respond to the HIV-AIDS
epidemic.
</P>
<P>
4. Establish a national information base on HIV-AIDS.
</P>
<P>
5. Strengthen the national capacity to undertake research
relevant to HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
While recognizing the contributions of individuals, community
groups and organizations in the war against AIDS, the government
has enhanced AIDS control activities through an effective
planning program, and increased availability of resources and
constant supervision of delivery of AIDS related services.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, a strategy to increase awareness of the public
about AIDS has been applied in the fight against the epidemic. On
the main airport road into Kampala, huge bill-boards recommend
abstinence, fidelity and the use of condoms, and "Straight Talk",
a monthly pullout in "The New Vision", main national daily, deals
with everything from date rape to masturbation.
</P>
<P>
What is more, a national network of blood examination has been
set up to avoid HIV affection by way of blood transfusion. A new
HIV rapid testing kit has been introduced to various HIV testing
centers in Uganda to ease the work of testing and enable
implementors to avail blood results within 20 minutes.

<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Household Electrical Appliance '96
opened in Beijing today, featuring up-to-date products made by
more than 100 major domestic and overseas manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition was sponsored by the China Light Industry
Council and the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese electrical appliance producers are facing fierce
competition both at home and abroad, as leading foreign producers
have entered China's market, a local observer said.
</P>
<P>
Liu Chuntao, vice-chairman of the Hefei Rongshida Group Co.,
said that most of the overseas giants, such as Germany's Semiens,
and Japan's Sanyo, and Electrolux, are challenging the domestic
enterprises, who are at a disadvantage in terms of technology,
management and funding.
</P>
<P>
Liu said many Chinese manufacturers now are considering the
world market; early this year, Wuxi Little Swan Co., Ltd. began
exporting washing machines to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China produced 9.3 million refrigerators,
9.5 million washing-machines, and 5.2 million air-conditioners
last year.

BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- China will cooperate with a
Singaporean company and Aero International Asia (AIA) to develop a
100-seat passenger jetliner.
</P>
<P>
The Aviation Industries of China (AVIC), Singapore Technology
Private Ltd. (STPL) and AIA have signed a letter of intent for the
joint project, said an AVIC spokesman. AIA's members are
Aerospatiale of France, British Aerospace and Alenia of Italy.
</P>
<P>
"Negotiations are underway, and the project is expected to
start before the end of the year," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He added the three parties have reached consensus on basic
issues, such as that the plane's final assembly line will be
located in China.
</P>
<P>
This is the largest Sino-foreign cooperative project undertaken
by China's aircraft manufacturing industry. The country's air
traffic has grown by about 20 percent in the past 15 years, and
planes with greater seating capacity are expected to be in demand
in the future.
</P>
<P>
With their long-term interests in both China's and the world
market, the world's chief aircraft manufacturers, including Boeing
and McDonnell-Douglas of the United States, and some European
aerospace companies, have expressed an interest in the Chinese
project.
</P>
<P>
During Chinese Premier Li Peng's visit to France in April, AVIC
signed a letter of intent with Aerospatiale to jointly develop
100-seat jetliners.

ways to liquidate the Zimbabwean rebels (Chimuenjes) operating in
Mozambique.

allegation by a Liberian refugee spokesman that refugees in Ghana
were being harassed, a report reaching here today said.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman was quoted as saying that Ghanaian military

illegal weapons at two camps in the central and western regions.

and it did not uncover any arms or ammunition, he told the Daily

This was confirmed by Chrysantus Ache, resident representative
of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Unlimited Market Demands Endangers Seahorses: WWF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) said
today that unless the market demands for seahorses were checked,
the population of this wild sea animal could crash.
</P>
<P>
Seahorse is thought to have existed for at least 40 million
years. At least 20 million seahorses, live or dead, are being
traded worldwide each year, involving at least 32 nations.
</P>
<P>
Their prices range from up to 1,200 U.S. dollars per kilogram
in Hong Kong to 11.49 dollars for a dried seahorse in Japan,
depending partly on size, said WWF.
</P>
<P>
A recent report, entitled "The International Trade in
Seahorses," lists the largest seahorse importers as China, Hong
Kong and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The largest exporter is India, with annual sales of at least
1.3 million seahorses or 3,000 kilograms of that sea animal,
followed by the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Seahorses are used as traditional medicines in China, Japan and
Korea, which are believed to benefit a range of conditions,
including respiratory disorders, sexual dysfunctions and general
lethargy and pain.
</P>
<P>
Some countries like Canada, Germany, the Netherlands and the
United Kingdom import seahorses as curios or aquarium pets.

<HEADLINE> Australia Reverses Trade Deficit With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Australia boosted its exports to
China by over 40 percent in the first three months of this year,
reversing its trade deficit into a surplus with China.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)
today showed that Australia enjoyed a 32.7 billion Australian
dollar (25.8 billion US dollars) trade surplus with China in the
first quarter of 1996, compared with trade deficits of 737.1
billion Australian dollars (582.3 billion US dollars) in 1995 and
557.9 billion Australian dollars (440.7 billion US dollars) in
1994.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade volume totaled 2.09 billion Australian dollars
(1.65 billion US dollars) in the three months to March, an
increase of 24.8 percent over the same quarter in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Australia's exports to China grew by 40.2 percent in the
period, while its imports from China grew by 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
China's greater demand for Australian grain was the major
factor for Australia's exports boom to China, which was partially
offset by a drop in its exports of wool to China.
</P>
<P>
Australia exported 26.3 million Australian dollars (20.8
million US dollars) worth of wheat to China during January to
March, an increase of 302 percent over the same period of last
year.
</P>
<P>
It also boosted barley exports to China by 116 percent to 17
million Australian dollars (13.4 million US dollars) in the
period.
</P>
<P>
Higher wheat prices on international market also helped to
improve Australia's exports income from China.
</P>
<P>
However, subdued demand for Australian wool drove its export
volume down by 47.9 percent to 100 million Australian dollars
(79.6 million US dollars) in the three months over the same period
of last year.
</P>
<P>
In the same time, China's exports of shoes to Australia fell
sharply to 67.5 million Australian dollars (53.3 million US
dollars), down nearly 10 percent from the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
China is now the sixth largest trading partner of Australia,
while Australia is the tenth largest trading partner of China.
Bilateral trade is expected to continue to grow this year.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Promises Huge Loans for China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank will lend China up
to nine billion US dollars in the next three fiscal years starting
this July, the Bank's resident mission announced here today.
</P>
<P>
"The World Bank's annual lending to China will stand somewhere
between 2.5 and three billion US dollars," Daud Ahmad, chief of
the operation's unit of the resident mission, told reporters,
quoting the bank's new Three-Year Rolling Lending Program for
China.
</P>
<P>
He added that according to the program, which was discussed by
the World Bank and China in June, the funds will be used to
finance 15 or 16 projects.
</P>
<P>
The pattern of distribution of funds basically will be
maintained, Ahmad said, indicating that lending priorities will
continue to be given to agriculture, transportation, energy,
environmental protection and other infrastructural projects.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics of the resident mission show that since China
rejoined the World Bank in 1980, the international financial body
has financed 174 Chinese projects, 68 of which have already been
completed.
</P>
<P>
The Bank's committed lendings to China amount to about 25.2
billion US dollars, with actual payments standing at more than
15.1 billion US dollars, the statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Pan Xiaojiang, deputy director of the World Bank Department of
the Chinese Ministry of Finance, said China's utilization of World
Bank funds has entered a peak period since the start of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Bank's yearly lending to China reached an
all-time high of 3.17 billion US dollars in the fiscal year
between July 1992 and June 1993.
</P>
<P>
"Since then, China has been the Bank's largest borrower for
four consecutive years," Pan said, adding that the World Bank
extended 2.97 billion US dollars in loans to China in the past
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
"Cooperation between China and the World Bank is encouraging,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Pieter Bottelier, chief of the resident mission, said that the
World Bank and China have developed a "mature and important"
partnership. He said that projects financed by the Bank cover
almost all sectors of the Chinese economy and all parts of China.
</P>
<P>
"No countries are as serious as China toward the World Bank and
China is an extremely good performer in implementing World
Bank-financed projects," Bottelier said.

General Abacha, who accepted the invitation of Cameroonian
President Paul Biya in mid-may to personally attend the on-going
OAU summit, did not go to Yaounde, and his absence has
disappointed, among others, African leaders including OAU's
Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Abacha's stay-away triggered a furore at the
Nigerian embassy in Yaounde, where anxious Nigerians waiting for
him embarked on a protest.
</P>
<P>
After waiting for General Abacha, the Nigerians, members of
cultural dancers from various consular areas of Cameroon, were
angry to learn that the head of state would not be coming.
</P>
<P>
The dancers, who had been performing all day long as a form of
rehearsal prelude to Abacha's arrival, besieged the gate of the
embassy in protest. They left the embassy at about 6:15 pm, said
an eye witness, quoted by local press today.
</P>
<P>
But Abacha was still being expected to arrive for the meeting
as at Monday night.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, Abacha cancelled the trip to
Yaounde on Sunday for an undisclosed reason.
</P>
<P>
So far there has been no official explanation of his absence
at the summit. Foreign affairs minister Tom Ikimi, who has been
in the Cameroonian capital since July 4 where he attended the
64th ordinary session of the OAU Council of Ministers,
represented the head of state at the summit.
</P>
<P>
Unofficial sources, however, said that CameroOn had shown bad
faith in its invitation to the head of state when it cancelled a
planned summit between him and president Biya scheduled for June
20 in Kara, Togo. Togoless President identified just as Eyadema
was to mediate in the dispute between the two countries over the
oil-rich Bakassi peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Nigeria viewed a recent letter by CameroOnian
external relations minister Ferdinand Oyono to his Nigerian
counterpart as insulting to Nigeria and the person of the head of
state.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, General Abacha presented an address to the
on-going OAU summit. The 19-page speech, read on his behalf by
Ikimi, touched on the dispute over Bakassi, the crisis in
Burundi, the civil war in Liberia, African economic problems,
democracy and human rights in the continent, and the need for
dialogue in resolving critical issues among OAU member states.

<HEADLINE> Okinawa Governor Rejects Hashimoto's Base Request </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Masahide Ota, Governor of Japan's
southernmost island prefecture Okinawa, today in a letter rejected
a request by Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto that he renew a
lease of land in a U.S. military base, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Tokyo, Ota said that he could not meet
the request before a final ruling of the Supreme Court over his
appeal against a lower court decision ordering him to sign
documents needed for continued rental of land owned by Okinawa
residents for use by the U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the content of an interim report by a
Japan-U.S. governmental panel on how to reduce U.S. bases in
Okinawa is not satisfactory to people in Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
Ota is now in Tokyo for a Supreme Court hearing over the appeal.
</P>
<P>
The central government is pushing for procedures necessary to
use land at 12 U.S. facilities, whose leases expire in May, and
for the Sobe communications installation, whose lease has already
expired.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the prefecture and the U.S. have been
strained since the rape of an Okinawan schoolgirl by three
U.S. servicemen last year.
</P>
<P>
The incident sparked angry protest against the U.S. military
presence on the island and Ota has spearheaded a drive to cut down
on the American presence.

<HEADLINE> Industrialization in Africa: A Mission Ambitious But Impending (part two) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 7 (Xinhua) -- "That's the first sign to show
that the continent is faced with an unprecedented opportunity for
developing its industry capacity," said Campos.
</P>
<P>
The foreign investment rate in Africa, which is over 30
percent, is the highest in the world, according to a report
recently released by the United Nations Economic Committee for
Africa (ECA).
</P>
<P>
"There is an unique business opportunity to fill in the blanks
and invest into Africa's industrial sector, which is realized by
only very few developed nations," said Campos.
</P>
<P>
The UNIDO Chief said his organization, a major advocator of
the AAI, has made a long-term plan to build Africa's industrial
might.
</P>
<P>
"It is our goal that at least 50 percent of our budgeted
resources are directed to Africa in the next ten years," said
Campos.
</P>
<P>
"We have a new mandate to provide more effective assistance,
particularly to the least developed countries in Africa," he
explained.
</P>
<P>
The UNIDO Chief said despite the severe cuts in UNIDO's budget
for 1996-97 caused by the recently announced financial withdrawal
of the United States, UNIDO will pour into Africa another 70
million U.S. Dollars for industrial development.
</P>
<P>
He described the UNIDO's experiment in Cote d'Ivoire is "very
encouraging," adding two other countries, namely Ghana and
Cameroon, has accepted to cooperate with the U.N. body for
developing their industrial capacity.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement reached at the OAU summit meeting,
an all-Africa private sector forum, scheduled in the Ghanaian
capital of Accra later this year, is to work out detailed
guidance in the development of the AAI.
</P>
<P>
"We are waiting for good news from the Accra meeting," said
Campos.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the political will is there, the UNIDO Chief
gave a definite "yes".
</P>
<P>
He explained during the OAU Council of Ministers meeting which
ended last Saturday, and the ongoing OAU summit, he had acquired
wide-ranged moral support from the African leaders on the UNIDO
plan.
</P>
<P>
"The emergency has been fully realized by leaders of the
continent. But now there is a question: where can we mobilize
sufficient resources?" asked Campos.
</P>
<P>
Promising that his organization is "fully devoted" to the
African cause, he said more lobby work should be done in the
industrialized western world and its powerful financial
organizations.
</P>
<P>
"We must let them realize that the rest of the world will
benefit from the development of the African continent," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But first of all, it is an African affair. And it should be
done by ourselves," said Makhan, the Mr. Aec.
</P>
<P>
The African continent is bound with abundent industrial
resources which has for decades exploited by the western world.
But now, the Africans, in unity, decided to develop their own
industrial might.)
</P>
<P>
"Wish us good luck, and lend us your hand," said the OAU
Deputy Secretary General.
</P>
<P>
"African industrialization. An ambitious dream,
but a realistic one," he said.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Take Measures to Cope with Problems Facing Tourism (by Huang Jianming) (I) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus tourism, accounting for 21
percent of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), is facing
strong competition and some problems this year, but it is
expected to remain in the same level as last year in view of
tourist arrivals and economic gains.
</P>
<P>
This view came today from Phryne Michael, Director-General of
the Cyprus Tourism Organization (CTO), in his interview with
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the prospects of the Cyprus tourism this year, the
Director-General admitted that international competition in the
tourism industry is very intense.
</P>
<P>
She, however, said "Cyprus is a popular European tourist
destination in the Eastern Mediterranean, offering an excellent
tourist product, which is characterized by a high quality and
variety, meeting the expectations of a demanding clientele."
</P>
<P>
Michael noted that during the past few years, the number of
tourists visiting Cyprus was more than two million per year, and
the annual earnings from tourism reached 1.7 billion
U.S. dollars, representing 40.3 percent in 1995 of the total
revenue from the export of goods and services together.
</P>
<P>
"We expect to have similar results in 1996," she said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, some people here give a more pessimistic outlook
of the tourism industry, and warn of a decline if certain measures
are not taken immediately.
</P>
<P>
Marios Clerides, head of Planning and Research at Hellenic
Bank, was quoted as saying that the general expectation is for a
fall in numbers of tourists and tourism revenues this year.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Cyprus Minister of Commerce, Industry and Tourism
Kyriakos Christofi said there were some problems facing the
tourism industry, such as cost of tourist product, quality and
fierce competition from other tourist destinations.
</P>
<P>
The minister called for reducing the cost and upgrading tourist
products in order to solve the problems.
</P>
<P>
According to the CTO figures released recently, total arrivals
for the first five months of the year show a one percent drop.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Take Measures to Cope with Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tourism experts here believe that factors affecting the
performance of the sector are attributed mainly to a steep fall in
tourist arrivals from Britain, the main tourist source to Cyprus,
which used to account for about 50 percent of the market share
with over one million visitors.
</P>
<P>
Last year, that figure fell to 850,000, a drop of around 15
percent. Further drop is expected this year.
</P>
<P>
Higher prices, poor service and the unfavorable currency
exchange rates between the Cyprus and British pounds are the main
cause driving British tourists away, Noel Josephides,
Chairman of the Association of Greek Cypriot Travel Agents
(AGTA), said recently in a meeting.
</P>
<P>
But CTO Chairman Antonis Andronicou argued that the
decrease of the British tourists is also due to a general decline
in arrivals in other tourist resorts, such as Greece.
</P>
<P>
He said that increased arrivals from Belgium, Switzerland and
Russia show that Cyprus is a popular destination for tourists
from these countries.
</P>
<P>
Phryne Michael also denied that Cyprus is facing a major slump
in tourism. She told Xinhua that "We expect, in 1996, to have
about the same number of tourists and economic gains we had
last year."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the measures taken to cope with the problems
facing tourism, the Director-General said: "Our policy is aimed at
differentiating and embellishing our tourist product, attracting
higher spending tourists, rather than maximizing the number of
tourist arrivals."
</P>
<P>
"In line with this policy, we develop and promote new forms of
tourism, such as rural tourism, with the renovation of old
traditional houses in the rural areas and their conversion into
tourist accommodations, nautical tourism, with the creation of
new marinas," she said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus also encourages the private sector to establish golf
courses and other sport facilities for tourism, she
added.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Cyprus government set up a special committee in
charge of figuring out ways to handle the problems facing the
island's tourist industry.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives has also approved an extra one
million Cyprus pounds (two million U.S. dollars) to CTO for the
promotion of the Cyprus tourism abroad.

<P>
CAIRO, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
will pay a working visit to Turkey Thursday at the invitation of
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish-Israeli military agreement is expected to be the
focus of Mubarak's talks in Ankara, the Egyptian Middle East News
Agency (MENA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
Under the military agreement, signed in February, Israel can
use Turkey's air space in military training.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, Syria and some other Arab states have shown special
concern over the agreement, fearing that Turkey and Israel might
forge a military alliance threatening the Arab security.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak will also hold talks with Demirel and other senior
Turkish officials on latest developments in the Middle East,
bilateral relations and other issues of mutual concern, MENA
said.

<HEADLINE> Japanese People Still Keen On Foreign Tours Despite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Japanese people are still keen to
travel abroad and buy goods with foreign brands despite higher
prices caused by the dollar's recovery to the 110 yen level from
its historic low below 80 yen early last year, Kyodo News Service
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Prices for overseas tours for the April-September period rose
by an average 3 to 4 percent after falling for the fifth year in a
row.
</P>
<P>
JTB Inc. foresees further price hikes for such tours after
October partly due to higher hotel accommodation fees worldwide, a
travel company official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Despite such circumstances, however, demand for traveling
abroad remains strong, the JTB official said.
</P>
<P>
Goods with foreign brands, particularly popular among Japanese
women, are also sporting higher price tags, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Prices of Louis Vuitton products moved up by an average 8.4
percent in February and another 6.6 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
Those for goods such as Hermes-brand scarfs increased by an
average 10 percent in May, while those for bags and other products
under the Chanel brand went up by 2 to 5 percent beginning in
July.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Again Rejects Japan's Microchip Pact Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States today again turned
down Japan's proposal that the two countries should sign a
multilateral accord on microchip trade with the European Union
(EU), saying that EU members are not major semiconductor producers.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters at the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo,
U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale also stressed the
necessity for the two countries to reach a bilateral pact as the
major semiconductor producer countries.
</P>
<P>
Japan and the U.S. have differences in whether to renew the
current five-year bilateral microchip agreement which is due to
expire on July 31.
</P>
<P>
Washington wants to renew it, while Tokyo is pushing for
replacing the accord with a multilateral one involving the EU.
</P>
<P>
According to the old pact, Japan has to reserve at least 20
percent of the domestic market for foreign chips, which, as the
country argued, is unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. offered to drop the 20 percentage target, but still
stuck to calculating and monitoring the foreign market share in
line with the old pact.
</P>
<P>
Japan and the EU on Monday rejected monitoring the foreign
market share in the semiconductor market in any given country as a
way of gauging the openness of the market.
</P>
<P>
They also turned down the use of numerical targets or anything
similar to it in microchip trade.
</P>
<P>
The EU, which considered the 1991 Japan-U.S. accord going
against the interests of European chip makers, sided with Japan on
establishing a multilateral cooperative framework.

<HEADLINE> China to Build Underwater Museum in Three Gorges Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FULING (Sichuan Province), July 10 (Xinhua) -- China is
planning to spend more than 100 million yuan on the construction
of an underwater museum to protect carvings on a 1.6-km-long rock
in the area.
</P>
<P>
White Crane Ridge, which has 18 fish carved on it, appears in
the Yangtze River each year between spring and summer, when the
water level is comparatively low.
</P>
<P>
For more than a thousand years the ridge, which also has some
30,000 characters in inscriptions carved nearby by poets and local
officials over the past 1,200 years, has been taken by locals to
be a water level meter.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists say that the inscriptions are earlier, better,
and greater in number than the famous low water carvings along the
Nile River in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The ridge, however, will be permanently submerged when the
Three Gorges project is finished. So, a work conference on
protecting cultural relics in the Three Gorges Area, which was
held in Beijing earlier this year, made a decision to build an
underwater museum for the ridge.
</P>
<P>
Experts from Tianjin University, the National Museum of Chinese
History, and the Committee on Water Conservation on the Changjiang
have made geological studies and done underwater archaeological
research around the ridge, and come up with a detailed design.
</P>
<P>
Preparatory work has already cost nearly one million
yuan. Shikon Takei, UNESCO representative in Beijing has shown a
willingness to offer help for the underwater project.
</P>
<P>
The design calls for an underwater museum with a double-layer,
shell-like building covering some 220 m of the ridge where most of
inscriptions are found.
</P>
<P>
Visitors will be able to see the inscriptions after passing
through a 130-m underwater passageway and entering a fish-shaped
exhibition hall.
</P>
<P>
Cultural relics unearthed in the area and historical documents
from the river will also be on display there.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia to Employ Jordanian Teachers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia, the oil-rich Gulf
kingdom, is expected to sign an agreement with Jordan soon on
employing 2,000 Jordanian teachers to work in Saudi
government-run and private schools, it was learned here today.
</P>
<P>
Even before the signing of the long-awaited agreement,
Jordanians who are eager and ready to return to the Gulf state
several years after they were deported due to the Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait and the Gulf War, have begun to send their
applications to Saudi authorities, sources here told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
A special Saudi committee will arrive here in two days to
interview applicants who have applied for work in Saudi community
colleges, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The move will help lower the unemployment rate in the kingdom,
which was 15 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's sympathy with Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War, seen by
the Gulf states as supporting Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, made
Jordan receive nearly 400,000 Jordanian returners from the rich
Gulf and lose nearly four billion U.S. dollars from its workers'
remittances.
</P>
<P>
Worker's remittance is one of the three pillars of Jordan's
national economy, the other two are entrepot trade and tourism. In
addition, the kingdom relies on foreign assistance to certain
extent.
</P>
<P>
Although Jordan's receipts from worker's current remittances
reached 1.24 billion dollars in 1995, an increase of 16 percent
from 1994, it is still far below the highest level of four
billion dollars before the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Jordanians expect that more workers will be re-employed in
the Gulf, once Jordan and Kuwait bury their differences of the
past.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts here believe Jordanians' employment in the
Gulf will never be as it was.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing will be the same after the (Gulf) war," a Jordanian
correspondent told Xinhua.

<HEADLINE> Iran Stresses Firm Ties with Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian Embassy in Beirut
today accused some Arab media of spreading "baseless lies" on
relations between Lebanon and Iran, stressing that the relations
are "established on firm historic bases."
</P>
<P>
"It was regrettablly noticed in the past two or three days
that some press media proceeded in a unresponsible manner and
aroused doubts by publishing baseless lying stories on a
alleged tension or crisis in the relations between Iran and
Lebanon," the Iranian diplomatic mission said.
</P>
<P>
"In this manner these press media reported, distortedly and
indecently, some of the meetings (between Lebanese and Iranian
officials) and the developments of bilateral relations between
the two countries," the embassy added in a statement distributed
to the press.
</P>
<P>
"It seems that there are some unofficial currents unhappy to
see an enhancement of the relations between the Islamic Republic
of Iran and Lebanon," it said. "They are trying to destroy the
untroubled relations in favor of their special narrow interests
at the cost of the highest interests of the two countries."
</P>
<P>
"The Islamic Republic of Iran expresses its deep regret for
these attempts, and calls on the press media, which are
considered as the essential basis for every state, especially a
democratic state like Lebanon, to proceed in a responsible
manner."
</P>
<P>
Reports appeared in almost all newspapers printed in the
Lebanese capital in the past few days that the Lebanese
government had ceased issuing visas to Iranians wishing to
travel to Lebanon following a tension between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi-owned Arabic daily Al-Hayat claimed Tuesday that
the decision, put in effect three weeks ago, was meant to
caution the Iranian government against sending aid and relief
supplies to certain Lebanese individuals and groups, a reference
to Hezbollah, or Party of God, and other allies of the
Islamic republic in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The London-based international paper quoted diplomatic sources
as saying that Tehran "has annoyed Lebanese officials by
bypassing the government in spite of previous promises that it
would only deliver Iranian aid to official Lebanese agencies."
</P>
<P>
The sources added that Iran's most recent financial
contribution amounted to six million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Hamayon Alizada, Iran's ambassador to Lebanon, recently said
that his country "has pledged to help (the Lebanese) and it
was committed to the resistance movement" in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Iran is the main trainer and arm and financial supplier
for Hezbollah, whose reputation as the spearhead of the
Lebanese resistance against the Israeli occupation was
considerably promoted as a result of a 16-day Israeli blitz
in southern Lebanon in April.

PARIS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- France succeeded in sending two
satellites, the Arabsat-2A and Turksat-1C, at the Kourou space
center in French Guyana at 22:25 GMT Tuesday, according to local
media reports from Kourou.
</P>
<P>
The two satellites, both made by the Aerospatiale company of
France, were dropped by Ariane rocket at two permanent
geostationary positions of 26 degrees east above Zaire and 31.3
degrees east above Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The operation was delayed for 45 minutes behind the schedule
due to heavy clouds in the sky. This is the 116th and 117th
satellites ever sent by Ariane since the rocket began sending
satellites in 1981.
</P>
<P>
Arab and Turkish officials at the launching site expressed
their satisfaction with the operation, said Agence France Presse.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish vice-minister of transport said Turkey would soon
open a bid for the building of a second-generation satellite.
</P>
<P>
The Turksat, belonging to the Turkish post and
telecommunications company Turk Telecom, will be followed by
intermediary stations in Australia, Canada, Britain and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Arabsat-2A, belonging to the Arabsat group membering 21
Arab countries, will be followed by ground stations in Australia,
China, the United States, Germany, Italy and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The space center in Toulouse, southern France, will coordinate
the ground stations in satellite control and calculation of
satellite operations.

TOKYO, July 10 (Xinhua) -- An overwhelming 76 percent of people
surveyed in an opinion poll are against the proposed consumption
tax hike to 5 percent from 3 percent beginning next April, Kyodo
News Service quoted an economic paper as reporting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper Asahi Shimbun said its latest poll shows only 18
percent support the consumption tax increase, adding that this is
mainly due to the lack of clear explanation from the government.
</P>
<P>
Asked about problems stemming from the planned tax hike, 46
percent cited a heavier burden on household spending, 21 percent
feared additional consumption tax increases and 19 percent were
concerned about price hikes associated with the tax hike.
</P>
<P>
The Asahi poll, taken Sunday and Monday, also shows the approval
rating of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's cabinet rose to 47
percent from 44 percent in May but still far lower than 61 percent in
January immediately after his cabinet's inauguration.

<HEADLINE> Simplified Procedures for Airlines and Agents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Ticket agents in China will have a
simpler time with billing procedures thanks to the International
Air Transport Association's new accounting project.
</P>
<P>
By joining the Billing and Settlement Plan (BSP), used by IATA
worldwide, China's ticket agents will have standard traffic
documents (STD) for domestic flights starting this September,
according to sources at IATA's China office.
</P>
<P>
Agents' sales will go into BSP's China Data Processing Center
in Beijing, which will provide forms and billing documents to the
Construction Bank of China, which handles airlines' and agents'
accounts directly.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the program simplifies sales procedures and
airlines' and agents' accounts, and reduce costs.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, IATA had 57 BSPs around the world. BSP
China was established in July of last year, and Chinese agents
started to use STDs that month on international flights of
domestic and foreign airlines.
</P>
<P>
IATA was formed by 236 airlines, with headquarters in
Montreal. China's three biggest carriers - Air China, China
Eastern Airlines, and China Southern Airlines - joined it in
August, 1993. China Southwest Airlines became the fourth Chinese
member last May.

<HEADLINE> Industrialization in Africa: A Mission Ambitious But Impending (part one) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 7 (Xinhua) -- For the first time, African
leaders gathered together to discuss industrialization in the
continent.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing 32nd Organization of African Unity (OAU) summit
meeting, held in the Cameroonian capital of Yaounde from July 8
to 10, moved to create the first ever alliance for Africa's
industrialization (AAI).
</P>
<P>
Industrialization in Africa?
</P>
<P>
Since 1980 when the OAU special economic summit adopted the
Lagos plan of action which raised the issue, the continent has
shown little progress in industrial development.
</P>
<P>
The contribution of the industrial sector to the gross
domestic product (gdp) has been declining and is below five
percent in many countries in the continent.
</P>
<P>
And with little industrial capacity, agricultural-oriented
Africa has for a long time been marginalized by the world
economic system.
</P>
<P>
"We still have to spend billions of Dollars every year to
import expensive industrial products with our limited pocket of
hard currency earned through the export of our cheap raw
materials," Vijay Makhan, OAU Deputy Secretary General in charge
of economic affairs who is attending the ongoing OAU summit, said
in an interview with Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
"That's why there is an emergency for industrialization for
Africa," said Makhan who is the vehementian advocator of economic
integration in Africa, and often saluted as "Mr. Aec" (African
Economic Community).
</P>
<P>
And now, Africa's industrialization campaign is high on the
agenda of the OAU summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
For most of the people, industrialization seems to be a dream
too ambitious to realize. But not for Mauricio Campos.
</P>
<P>
"While the challenges are unique, the opportunities are unique,
too," said the man who is the Director General of the United
Nations Industry Development Organization (UNIDO) and a major
designer of the alliance, also in an interview with Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
"We know that with backward infrastructure, limited financial
resources, little experience, the unfair world trade and
financial system, the challenges are enormous for the endeavor,"
said Campos.
</P>
<P>
He said after years of fight for national independence and
political unrest, Africa has at last entered a period of
political stability and economic recovery.

<TEXT>
<P>
Under the law, the Federation will create an integrated army of
40,000 Muslim and 15,000 Croat soldiers within three years.
</P>
<P>
The law was passed after the two ethnic partners overcame
numerous disputes between them, including a latest one concerning
who should be the supreme commander of the joint forces.
</P>
<P>
The two sides now agree to postpone the settlement of
"commander" issue for three months and in the meantime both
Bosnian president Alija Izetbegovic, a Muslim, and the Bosnian
Federation President Kresimir Zubak, a Croat, will jointly assume
the role.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has conditioned the U.S. training of
and providing weapons for Bosnian army, estimated to cost 800
million U.S. dollars, on the adoption of the joint defense law.
</P>
<P>
"This removes the last of the obstacles for the realization of
the "Equip and Train" program which will render the system more
efficient", Federation Defense Minister Vadimir Soljic commented
following the parliamentary action.
</P>
<P>
James Pardew, a Pentagon official who has been in the past
weeks serving as a mediator for Muslims and Croats on the military
disputes, was present when the federation parliament approved the
defense law.

But the party's police spokesman George Hawkins said that he
believes that is only the tip of the iceberg, with thousands more
managing to avoid police.

<HEADLINE> China Able To Handle IFLA Conference, Official Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese official has said that
China is fully able to host the 62nd General Conference of the
International Federation of Library Associations next month, with
3,000 representatives expected from all over the worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The world's biggest gathering of librarians will take place at
the Beijing International Conference Center, which played host to
the UN Fourth World Conference on Women last year. Hundreds of
translators and interpreters are being prepped for this year's
gathering, August 25-31, said Liu Xiaoqin, a preparatory committee
member.
</P>
<P>
The IFLA was founded in 1927 in Britain, and has long been
controlled by developed countries, with most of the annual
conferences being held in industrialized countries. Only four have
been held in Asia, though China was one of the founders.
</P>
<P>
The organization has 1,460 members from 139 countries and
regions. Liu said that many countries have expressed the belief
that China should host a meeting.
</P>
<P>
"China has a 5,000-year history and was one of the first
countries to build a library. As its economy improves, its
libraries are also being modernized, and it has the experience to
play host of the conference," she noted.
</P>
<P>
Most libraries in the developed countries are using computers
and the Internet to provide services and improve management. But
Chinese libraries still lag behind, mainly because of fund
shortages. Liu said she hopes the meeting, whose theme is "the
challenge of change: libraries and economic development", will
help China to improve its libraries and contribute to the
country's economic take-off.
</P>
<P>
She said that the Chinese government places great importance on
the meeting and formed a preparatory committee presided over by
State Councillor Luo Gan.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng also has sent a message of encouragement to the
committee. Li said that libraries are a treasure house of human
knowledge, and plays an irreplaceable role in advancing
civilization, and noted that the conference is of great
significance for libraries in China and other countries.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that the support of the central government is one
guarantee of the conference's success.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Spar Aerospace Corp. Showing Interest in China Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Canada's Spar Aerospace Corp. is
considering cooperating with China to jointly build two radar
satellites in the next few years, according to Colin D. Watson,
president &AMP; CEO of the company.
</P>
<P>
Spar was set up in 1967, with headquarters in Toronto, and
became a major hi-tech company involved in space, aviation,
defence, communications, information, and software technology.
</P>
<P>
China's tremendous, speedy economic growth has made it a great
potential market, causing Spar to consider expanding its business
here, especially in the area of satellite telecommunications,
Watson said during a recent visit to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Spar is holding discussions with China's Ministry of Aerospace
Industry and its Commission on Science, Technology and Industry
for National Defense to cooperate on two radar satellites, to help
China predict natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation will use Spar's satellite-building technology
as well as China's rocket-launching technology, Watson
explained. The company has been helping China develop satellite
communications through its subsidiary, the US's ComStream Corp.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, Spar acquired ComStream, which had already been doing
business in China for many years. Its first project was an
international com-sat earth station in China in 1972, when US
President Richard Nixon made his state visit to China, news of
which was transmitted to the world via the satellite facility.
</P>
<P>
ComStream took part in building a satellite communications
system in the Tibet Autonomous Region in southwest China early
this year, which is expected to be finished by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
ComStream has by now built over 3,000 earth stations in China,
and has offices and service centers in most major cities. It is
interested in China's vast rural area, with its great potential
communication products market, to help more than 500,000 townships
and villages that do not have good communications facilities.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Stop Illegal Wildlife Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is going to implement a
project to strictly control the illegal trading of wild animals
within the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Investigations have shown that Vietnam is home to 275 species
of mammals, 800 species of birds, 80 species of amphibians, and
2,500 species of fish.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's biodiversity is relatively unique as 10 per cent of
the world's mammal, bird and fish species can be found here while
40 per cent of the local plant species are endemic and believed to
be found nowhere else but in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
However, the rapid population growth, the reduction of forest
areas due to illegal exploitation of forests, the destruction of
the 30 - year war, and the over-exploitation of marine resources
have led to the fact that 28 per cent of mammals, 10 per cent of
birds, and 21 per cent of reptiles and amphibians are threatened
with extinction.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the illegal trading of rare wild animals across
border has also considerably contributed to the loss of rare
0animals in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Every year, tens of thousands of rare animals such as
pheasants, monkeys, bears, elephants, tortoises, martens, and
pangolins are illegally caught and smuggled.
</P>
<P>
Several hundred cases of rare animals smuggling have been
discovered in 18 border provinces and cities across the country.
</P>
<P>
Apart from smuggling live animals, wild animal meat has also
been discovered on sale at hotels and restaurants both at home and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
The immediate objective of the biodiversity plan is to protect
the country's ecosystems, especially those vulnerable ecosystems
threatened by economic activity, and especially to identify the
utility value of such biodiversity and recognise the importance of
economic development being environmentally sustainable.

<P>
SHENYANG, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The capital of northeast China's
Liaoning Province has worked out a plan to get foreigners
interested in investing in its key projects and has given priority

<HEADLINE> Western Region Attractive to Investors, Zhou Guangzhao Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- China's central-western region is
rich in natural, human and land resources and is attractive to
both domestic and overseas investors, according to Zhou Guangzhao,
chairman of the China Association for Science and Technology
(CAST) and president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
But the region is economically underdeveloped, due to
historical, social and natural factors, Zhou said today at the
opening ceremony of a symposium on investment in the
central-western region. The majority of China's 65 million
poverty-stricken people live there.
</P>
<P>
The central-western region accounts for 55.9 percent of the
national land area, and more than 60 percent of the national
mineral resources. The area also has abundant and cheap labor
resources and an enormous market.
</P>
<P>
All are a strong attraction for both domestic and overseas
investors, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the improving material foundation and increasingly
intense international competition also bring more overseas
investors to the region.
</P>
<P>
The Republic of Korea sent a 400-member delegation to the
symposium, which has also hosted businessmen from Japan, the
United States and the Netherlands.

<HEADLINE> 30 Million-Dollar Emeralds Lost in Bank Safe in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- A trunk of emeralds worth 30
million US Dollars that was deposited with a bank for safe
custody in Kitwe, Copperbelt province of Zambia, was reported
missing.
</P>
<P>
The emeralds belong to Moses Katumbi, Chairman and Chief
Executive of the Chani Fisheries Company, who had a rude shock
when he found his stones missing on Tuesday, according to a
report reaching here from Kitwe today.
</P>
<P>
Katumbi said he had been "swindled" out of the stones by
another businessman. He added he was informed by the Kitwe branch
of the Finance Bank of Zambia that his trunk was given to another
businessman without his consent and he wondered why such a thing
should happen.
</P>
<P>
Bank management refused to confirm the missing trunk because
of police presence and suggested that a search warrant be
obtained first, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The case has been reported to the police for investigation.

<HEADLINE> Pyongyang Backs Neutrality of Sweden, Austria, Finland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) supported the neutrality maintained by Sweden,
Austria and Finland and their refusal to join the NATO, the
official newspaper Rodong Simon said today.
</P>
<P>
Without mentioning their names, the paper said some countries
alleged Austria, Sweden and Finland would join the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) after their entry into the European
Union (EU) in January 1995.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the three countries had made clear their refusal
to participate in both the NATO and the Western European Union,
the EU's military arm and a link between the NATO and the EU.
</P>
<P>
Pyongyang favors the three countries' neutrality which it
believes is helpful to their self-determination and European
security and peace, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the DPRK and the three European countries,
which were established "on the basis of self-determination and
inter-dependence", are developing smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Like Sweden, Austria and Finland, the paper said, the DPRK also
highly values its right to self-determination.

<HEADLINE> Remains of 2,000-year-old Fief in Shaanxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The remains of a 1.65 sq km feudal
area dating back 2,000 years have been found in the Shangluo
Mountain area in northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists say that the fief belonged to Shang
Yang, a famous politician of the Qin State during the Warring
States Period (476-221 BC).
</P>
<P>
Shang was born in Wei State and went to Qin to help the king
there twice, making Qin the strongest state and paving the way for
its unifying of China later.
</P>
<P>
He was given the feudal ground in 340 BC but was killed by
conservatives after the death of the king.
</P>
<P>
Historical records show that he stayed on the fief for only two
years, but archaeologists have found indications that large-scale
reconstruction at the site did not stop until the Han Dynasty (206
BC-220 AD), and say that the 1,500 m by 1,100 m area had military
significance.
</P>
<P>
Beaten earth, construction materials, bronze and iron farming
tools have been found at the site.
</P>
<P>
The experts found valuable tiles bearing the Chinese character
"Shang", which show that the fief was given to Shang Yang.

<HEADLINE> State to Regulate Funeral Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- A draft of regulations on the
management of funerals and interment was deliberated at the 28th
session of the Beijing Municipal Congress, which opened Tuesday,
according to a report in today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several years, in some suburban areas of the
city, cemeteries were built without permission from the department
in charge, and only for profit, Liu Baocheng, director of the
Beijing Civil Affairs Bureau, said at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1994, there were 39 illegal cemeteries in 25
villages and townships of Beijing, occupying more than 40 hectares
of land.
</P>
<P>
The regulations will control the construction of cemeteries.
Builders must get permission from the city's Civil Affairs Bureau
and the local government before they can build a cemeteries.
</P>
<P>
The construction of cemeteries should make use of only barren
wasteland, not farmland, according to the draft regulations, which
also stipulate the area allowed for a cemetery.
</P>
<P>
Units and individuals who deal in the production and selling of
articles for funeral use should pass an examination and get
permission from the Civil Affairs Department.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that the mortality rate in the city was 186 per day.
There are 346 shops registered with industrial and commercial
administrations selling articles for funeral use, like wreaths.
And there are more than 100 unregistered shops.
</P>
<P>
Supply of these articles for funeral use has surpassed the
demand, said Liu.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Zhiliang, a member of the standing committee of the
Municipal People's Congress, remarked that the service prices in
registered cemeteries, including Babaoshan Cemetery, should be
regulated.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-China Relations Improved: White House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Relations between the United
States and China have been improved in the last several months
despite differences between the two countries, White House
Spokesman Michael McCurry said today.
</P>
<P>
"The overall climate of our bilateral relations has certainly
improved" because of the progress on economic issues,
specifically, the Intellectual Property Agreement, and other
issues, McCurry said,
</P>
<P>
The improvement is reflected in the "very cordial" reception
that Anthony Lake, Assistant to the President for National
Security Affairs, received in Beijing and the work he has done in
close cooperation with his Chinese counterparts on bilateral
issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lake, who is on a 5-day trip to China, is the first
highest-ranking U.S. official who has visited China since early
last year.
</P>
<P>
Lake was met by Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li
Peng in Beijing. He also had talks with Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen and other high-ranking officials.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said that there are still differences in the U.S.-China
relations, but the view of the U.S. Government is "the importance
of this relationship requires us to manage these differences very
carefully and prudently."
</P>
<P>
"We ought to find ways to make routine high-level meetings
between the PRC and the United States, including, conceivably, the
exchange of state visits by President Clinton and President Jiang
Zemin," he said.

<HEADLINE> China to Build 17 Optical Fiber Trunk Lines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- China plans to build 17 optical
fiber trunk lines with a total length of 22,000 kilometers over
the next five years, Peoples' Post and Telecommunications News
reports.
</P>
<P>
The trunk lines will connect all provincial capitals, and some
large and medium-sized cities.
</P>
<P>
The paper says that China has some 100 optical fiber
manufacturers, the best of which are some Sino-foreign funded,
state-owned, or domestically cooperative companies.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, optical fiber cables produced and marketed in China
totaled 200,000 km.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of optical fiber and urban telephone
relay optical fiber networks has played a significant role in
boosting the development of China's telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this century, very large cities are expected to
have a telephone popularization rate of 50 percent, and provincial
capitals and coastal open cities to have a 30-40 percent rate.

<HEADLINE> Unknown Pictographic Characters on Cliffs Shot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Mysterious characters carved on
cliffs in east China's Zhejiang Province have been photographed by
a local journalist.
</P>
<P>
The characters, first found in the year 405 in the Jin Dynasty
(265-420), have never been rubbed or recorded because their
location was hard to reach.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yinhua, a journalist with the Xianju County TV Studio, who
once served in the army, managed to get close to the cliffs to
photograph the characters.
</P>
<P>
The characters, carved within an area of 200 sq m, are in the
shapes of sun, men, fish, animals, plant and insects.
</P>
<P>
All the human figures are naked, dancing, with their hair tied.
</P>
<P>
Characters with a dog's head and feet occur repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
A scholar from Shanghai studied the characters and concluded
that they might be remains of the ancestors of the Se Nationality.
</P>
<P>
But when, how, and why the characters were carved, and what
they mean remains a mystery.

<HEADLINE> Economists Calling for Protecting National Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Economists in China said that
China should explore ways to make efficient use of foreign funds
while protecting national industries.
</P>
<P>
Several scholars aired their views in a recent issue of the
Guangming Daily.
</P>
<P>
"In a market economy, the term national industry should be
imbued with new connotations," said Wang Dongjing, an economics
professor at the party School of the Central Committee of the
Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, national industries are those firms which
are solely capitalized by Chinese investors, or joint ventures in
which the Chinese side holds the majority share.
</P>
<P>
Joint ventures should choose brands reflecting Chinese culture
rather than indiscriminately copying foreign names, said Pei
Changhong, a research fellow with the Institute of Finance and
Trade of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
China's endeavour to protect the national economy does not
contradict its desire to join World Trade Organization, said Wang
Linsheng, deputy director of the Chinese Society of International
Trade.
</P>
<P>
In fact, developed or developing countries have all set
restrictions in various degrees on the introduction of foreign
funds, in a bid to foster a national economy, the material
foundation of a nation's sovereignty and political independence,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted the domestic policies and measures for the protection
of national industries should comply with new market mechanisms
and the protection of national industries should follow
international practices.
</P>
<P>
Economists agreed that in the past, it was necessary to offer
overseas investors favorable policies. From now on, to encourage
fair competition favorable policies which give foreign companies a
distinct advantage should be diminished gradually.
</P>
<P>
Wang also noted that it's imperative for the country to gather
its scientific, technological and industrial strength to establish
domestic large and medium industrial groups and inject more funds
into pillar industries.
</P>
<P>
Overseas new and high-tech projects which can give impetus to
the national industry should be allowed to enter the Chinese
market, but firms with ordinary functions which Chinese firms
could easily fulfill should be strictly limited, Wang said.

<HEADLINE> ATF Announces Settlement in Discrimination Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms (ATF) of the U.S. Treasury Department has agreed to a
5.9 million-dollar settlement in a discrimination lawsuit brought
by black agents.
</P>
<P>
The settlement was announced on Tuesday in a case filed on
behalf of black ATF agents in a federal court in November
1990. The agents said the bureau discriminated in the hiring,
promotion and evaluation of blacks.
</P>
<P>
The suit sought back pay for black ATF agents to compensate
them for lack of promotional opportunities because of
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
In a fact sheet explaining the settlement, the ATF said the
case covered 189 blacks who are currently ATF agents and 51 former
black ATF agents.
</P>
<P>
The settlement provided for 4.7 million dollars to settle
individual claims, 1.2 million dollars to cover attorneys' fees,
and up to an additional 150,000 dollars to cover other fees
incurred over the life of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The suit contended that most black agents were assigned to
positions that occupied lower government job classifications and
had been kept out of executive positions at ATF.
</P>
<P>
The ATF last March was criticized in a Justice Department
report for incidents that occurred at "'Good Ol' Boys Roundup''
gatherings attended by ATF agents as well as local, state and
other federal law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department report said the gatherings, which had
been held for 16 years, had in recent years turned into marathon
drinking bouts where women feared for their safety and some
participants engaged in racist conduct.
</P>
<P>
In April, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin referred 31 ATF
agents for further investigation or possible disciplinary action
for participating in the events.

reject proposals with investments up to 600 crore rupees (about
171 million US dollars). Apart from this, it will also devote
itself to promoting investment and formulating transparent
guidelines for foreign investment.

an increase in the minimum wage after rejecting a Republican
attempt to narrow the number eligible.
</P>
<P>
The 74-24 vote passed a bill which would increase the minimum
wage for American workers from 4.25 dollars an hour to 4.75
dollars immediately and to 5.15 dollars a year later. It would
benefit about 10 million workers on the lowest wage level.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives also passed a bill on May 23
to increase the federal minimum wage. The Senate legislation would
have to be reconciled with a similar House bill. The compromise
would then be returned to both chambers for final approval and
sent to President Clinton for his expected signature.
</P>
<P>
The proposal to increase the minimum wage was put out by
Democrats earlier this year, on the ground that the real
purchasing power of current minimum wage would reach to the
lowest level in 40 years by January of next year because of
inflation.
</P>
<P>
It is obvious that Democrats have made the minimum wage a major
defining issue of their campaign to retain the U.S. presidency and
regain control of Congress in the election later this year.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Republicans have been accusing the Democrats of "playing
politics" on the matter in the election year and tried to narrow
the number eligible for the increase by an amendment which will
exclude new workers and employees of small businesses.
</P>
<P>
They argued that it would destroy jobs for those who need them
most -- young people with little work experience and welfare
recipients.
</P>
<P>
Just before adopting the bill, the U.S. Senate defeated with a
vote of 52-46 the Republican amendment that Democrats said would
deny the increase to more than 4 million of the 10 million U.S.
workers earning less than 5.15 dollars an hour.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton has promised to veto a bill including
any of what he called "poison pill" provisions.
</P>
<P>
The bill's immediate future was clouded when some Republican
Senators said they would seek to block House-Senate negotiations
until Democrats compromise on a separate health measure.
</P>
<P>
The minimum wage in U.S. was first established by U.S. Congress
in 1938 at 25 cents an hour. It has been increased periodically,
with the last rise taking effect in April 1991.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador, Peru to Face Withdrawal of U.S. Military Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Ecuadoran and Peruvian officials have
gathered in Lima to analyze the serious situation arising from the
U.S. announcement of its withdrawal of military support from a
South American peace-keeping mission in December.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador's Communication Ministry said today the superior
consultative committee of the Ecuadoran-Peruvian Military
Observers Mission (MOMEP) is discussing how to carry out the
mission without the logistical and technical support from the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts believe the United States may decide to postpone
the withdrawal in August when the new Ecuadoran government takes
office. This body has stated it will fully back the peace process
with Peru.
</P>
<P>
The MOMEP's role in keeping peace between Ecuador and Peru has
been crucial and any reduction in its current operational capacity
will jeopardize the mission it has been assigned, they said.
</P>
<P>
A suggested alternative is for the MOMEP to hire a private
company specializing in technical and logistical support but this
choice was ruled out because of its high cost.
</P>
<P>
Without logistical and technical support, the MOMEP will have
little real capacity to act in the area of dispute.

<HEADLINE> Western Donors Vow More Investments in Eastern Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The three-day Salzburg summit of 12
central and eastern European countries ended today with western
donors vowing to increase investments in the old east bloc.
</P>
<P>
Today's agenda covered the economic issues including the
situations, financial support and foreign investments in the
eastern countries.
</P>
<P>
Most of those attending, especially the economic experts and
entrepreneurs, favored more investments in the east.
</P>
<P>
Kurt Biedenkopf, president of Germany's Sachsen State, stressed
that capital and technological knowledge were the two primary
factors western countries should provide their eastern partners.
</P>
<P>
If the West failed to extend its help, there would be
instability in the East, which in turn would affect the stability
of the West, he added.
</P>
<P>
Top of the summit's agenda has been the eastward expansion of
the EU and NATO. Most eastern countries expressed their desires
for membership of the two blocs while Russia strongly opposed it.
</P>
<P>
Austrian President Thomas Klestil also showed his willingness
to join NATO, but this aroused strong criticisms from other top
officials of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Salzburg summit, sponsored by the World Economic Forum, is
scheduled to be held annually. It will aim to provide
opportunities for communication among the heads of the eastern
states and between the government leaders and figures of the
economic and industrial sectors.

<HEADLINE> Drug Traffickers Detained In Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Columbia has caught 1,623
alleged drug traffickers so far this year and put their cases to
the general prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
The captures were part of the campaign waged against
trafficking and associated problems by the government of Ernesto
Samper, military forces commander, Admiral Holdan Delgado
Villamil, said.
</P>
<P>
He said the figures spoke for themselves -- 18 tons of pure
cocaine were seized through the work of the air force, the army,
the navy and the National Police.
</P>
<P>
The drug was found ready to be shipped to black markets in the
United States and Europe. The commander was reporting to
ambassadors of the European Union and Latin America on campaigns
named "Operation Condor" and "Operation Conquista".
</P>
<P>
He explained that 247 tons of coca leaves being processed and
419 laboratories for processing the alkaloid were also destroyed
during the first six months of the year.
</P>
<P>
Defence Minister Juan Carlos Esguerra announced at the same
gathering that drug dealers were using children for their
illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
"It is seriously compromising the future of Colombia because
what we see is the destruction of our reserves on one hand, and
the utilization of our children on the other.
</P>
<P>
"As we reach the laboratories (of coca cultivation), we
discover how criminal organizations are shamelessly using the
labour of children under 16 years of age."
</P>
<P>
The criminals took advantage of the fact that the justice
system could not punish children seriously, he said.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Rejects U.S. Criticism on Anti-drug War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Colombia will not
surrender to U.S. pressures and will continue its efforts to fight
against illegal drugs, President Ernesto Samper said here today.
</P>
<P>
President Samper made the announcement when the United States
criticized Colombia that it was not doing enough in its war
against drugs.
</P>
<P>
Samper said that Colombia had allocated almost 1 billion
U.S. dollars to fight against drugs and has carried out two major
operations, Operation Condor and Operation Conquista.
</P>
<P>
Operation Conquista is the most important anti-drug campaign in
the world, in which more than 27,000 hectares of coca plants, or
70 percent of the total planted in Colombia and 15 percent of the
total grown in the world, were destroyed, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,000 people from the military and police forces
cooperated for the first time to develop an anti-drug operation in
central Colombia of Guaviare, where 60 percent of the illegal
crops in Colombia are found, Samper pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Colombian government has been making progress in
consolidating an Alternative Development Plan known as PLANTE.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to begin a series of massive operations to clean
up drug trafficking in strategically-located areas," explained the
Colombian president.
</P>
<P>
The government is providing financial aid to farmers so they
can free themselves, once and for all, from the economic
dependence on drugs, Samper added.

<HEADLINE> Some Banana Countries Seek Elimination of EU Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Five banana-exporting countries
expect the European Union (EU) to lift its restrictions on their
banana exports before a verdict is handed down by the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The mandatory verdict from the WTO is due on January 28, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The countries are Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The United States is involved because it controls some
multinational banana companies in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
The situation involving these countries and the EU resulted
from an EU policy that uses import licenses, tariffs and quotas to
restrict banana exports from these countries to protect banana
exporters in EU's colonies and countries in Africa, the Caribbean
and Pacific (ACP).
</P>
<P>
Under EU's new policies, bananas entering the European market
from its colonies and ACP countries are exempt from tariffs while
Latin American bananas have to pay 85 ECUs per ton.
</P>
<P>
An Ecuadoran official said the countries favoured by the EU
were given export quotas much higher than their real production
capacities.
</P>
<P>
The official also noted that negotiations between the EU and
these countries began today and EU was expected to respond on July
30.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 10 (Xinhua)-- A time bomb concealed inside a
flower tray offered at a shrine in the North Central Province of
Sri Lanka was discovered on Saturday morning, according to police
sources here today.
</P>
<P>
The 500 gram bomb, timed to go off at 8 p.m. that day, had been
offered at the shrine by one of the many devotees who visited the
shrine on that day where special prayers were to be performed.
</P>
<P>
An alert police informant had detected the tray from which a
thin wire was protruding and alerted the police, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The army bomb disposal squad who were rushed to the location
were able to defuse the bomb in time and prevented a possible
massacre.
</P>
<P>
The Buddhist shrine was built in April this year which is
working in close rapport with the police, the sources noted.
</P>
<P>
Police believed that the intended bomb could be a ploy of the
Tamil rebels.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Speed up Payment of Low-Interest Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government is
considering to accelerate the repayment of its external debts with
interest rates below 11 percent, according to officials sources
here today
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad said at a hearing with a
parliament commission Tuesday that the money to prepay the debts
would be derived from surplus funds in the state budget and income
from the privatization of state-owned companies.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's foreign debt burden now stands at near 100 billion
US dollars, which was described by some analysts as having reached
an alarming level.
</P>
<P>
Admitting that the government was also concerned about the huge
size of the debt, the finance minister stressed that the matter
should not be seen merely from the aspect of figures but also from
their composition and their use.
</P>
<P>
He said that commercial loans, with short-term repayment
periods and high interest rates, account for only three to four
percent of the country's external debts.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has paid up all its debts with interest rates over 11
percent to the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB),
the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that in the 1994-1996 period, Indonesia had
prepaid 2.073 billion US dollars of its external debts, of which
675 million US dollars were owed to the World Bank and 1.398
billion to the ADB.
</P>
<P>
The funds used for the prepayment were taken from the
privatization of state-owned companies such as PT. Indosat, PT.
Telkom and PT Timah, as well as from the state budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
The government will seek to increase revenues from taxes and
non-tax resources while putting a tighter lid on expenditures,
Mar'ie added.

<HEADLINE> Bangkok to Build Elevated Road Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has approved a
master plan of comprehensive network of elevated roads within,
around and radiating out from Bangkok to help ease the capital's
traffic problems.
</P>
<P>
The 80-kilometer-expressway network, approved at a cabinet
meeting Tuesday, will cost at least 80 billion baht (3.2 billion
US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The cabinet set an ambitious three-year deadline for completion
of the projects, which will form radius and ring routes in and
around Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
The projects will be implemented by private concessionaires.
</P>
<P>
Although the scheme will generate new hopes for improved
traffic in Bangkok, the timeframe may not have allowed for
traditional hurdles, such as political wrangling, resistance to
land expropriation and change of government.
</P>
<P>
After the approval of the master plan, Deputy Interior Minister
Sudarat Keyuraphan, who oversees the Expressway and Rapid Transit
Authority, said the approval did not mean that the government was
shifting its traffic policy -- from speeding up the construction
of public mass transit systems to building more roads. "We have to
admit the fact that we need more roads to accommodate the ever
increasing number of cars," she said.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok has already 47 kilometers of expressway in use and 85
kilometers are under construction at present.

Beijing, July 10 (Xinhua) -- China's lowering of interest rates
in May is to herald a new round of readjustments to the country's
economy, today's "China Daily" quoted financial experts as saying.
</P>
<P>
The reduction of loan interest will benefit most of the State
enterprises which will see their production costs and debts
decrease notably.
</P>
<P>
It will also help the country to reduce the ranks of unemployed
to the target of 8.5 million within the next five years.
</P>
<P>
And the reduction will facilitate the convertible transactions
of the renminbi over the long-term, predicted the experts.
</P>
<P>
Some economic experts expect interest rates will be further
reduced in the second half of this year, the paper said.

The economic survey report said the country's economy showed
encouraging indications during the outgoing fiscal year with a 6.1
percent economic growth against 2.6 percent in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
A relatively high economic growth and other positive economic
trends came out as a result of the liberal economic policies of
the present government, the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, the CPN-UML press release said the data included in
the survey report proved the contrary to the claims on the
government's economic performance by the report itself.
</P>
<P>
Analyzing the various economic sectors contributing to the
gross domestic product (GDP), there was no possibility of the rise
as claimed by the government, the opposition said.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML also accused the government of slashing the
development expenditure in its budget for the 1995-96 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
According to the government report, the development spending in
the year was down by 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
The present coalition government led by the Nepali Congress
(NC) Party came to power last September to replace the minority
government of the CPN-UML.

MEXICO CITY, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The following is a summary of
Latin American economic briefs:
</P>
<P>
SAN JOSE -- Costa Rica wants to renegotiate its debt repayments
with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) because it can't comply
with the target of reducing its fiscal deficit to 0.5 percent of
gross domestic product (GDP), Finance Minister Francisco de Paul
Gutierrez said.
</P>
<P>
An IMF mission will go to Costa Rica in August to assess the
country's situation and discuss the possibility of signing a new
agreement on debt repayment in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
MEXICO CITY -- Mexico's trade balance in agriculture plunged
86 percent in the first 4 months of this year, a report by the
National Agricultural Council said.
</P>
<P>
The trade balance in the January-April period was 172 million
U.S. dollars, compared with nearly 1.1 billion dollars in the same
period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the drop to a hefty 93 percent increase
in imports of basic grains and a 13 percent drop in the exports of
Mexican agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
MEXICO CITY -- Mexican companies are hoping to raise one
billion dollars on international markets over the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Banacci Group expects to receive 500 million dollars and
the remainder will be distributed to other companies such as Celanese
and Altos Hornos de Mexico. The stock issues will be offered
simultaneously on markets in Europe, the United States and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
HAVANA -- More than 140 Cuban and foreign companies from 12
countries will be displaying their products at Metanic '96, the
International Fair of Metallurgical, Mechanic and Electronic
Industries in Havana between July 16-20. The event is organized by
the Cuban Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
SAN JOSE -- Costa Rican exports totalled 1.49 billion dollars
during the first 5 months of this year, Foreign Trade
Minister Jose Rossi announced.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing is the most dynamic export sector, followed by
agriculture. The United States continues to be the most important
market for Cost Rica, taking half the total exports from the
Central American country. It is followed by the European Union
(24.5 percent) and Central America (14 percent).

<HEADLINE> Thai Garment Makers Shift to Asian Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Thai garment makers are planning
to shift their focus more on markets in Asia from those in Europe,
the United States and Japan, where they face increasing
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Member nations of the European Union (EU) had been buying more
clothes from Eastern and Southern Europe where fashionable
products were sold at a reasonable price, said Chavalit Nimla-or,
president of the Thai Garment Manufacturers Association.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. also might follow the EU pattern as it could use cheap
labor in Mexico under the North American Free Trade Agreement in
the next five years, Chavalit was quoted as saying by local
newspapers today.
</P>
<P>
To offset this trend, the association will turn more to markets
in South Korea, Hong Kong and other Southeast Asian countries, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The association will also encourage exporters to export more
clothes to the Middle East and other non-quota markets, he added.
</P>
<P>
The association's garment exports accounted for 30 percent of
the country's total of 120 billion baht (4.8 billion U.S. dollars)
last year. Currently, the production of members of the association
is mainly based on styles ordered by customers.

<HEADLINE> Nicaraguan Transportation Owners Launch National Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Transportation owners began a
national strike today to pressure the Nicaraguan executive and
legislative bodies not to repeal a law on tax exemptions.
</P>
<P>
The 35,000 operators involved in mass passenger and freight
transportation belong to l2 cooperatives. They are opposed to the
removal of a clause from a new tax bill.
</P>
<P>
The operators say they will protest indefinitely until they
have a positive response from the government.
</P>
<P>
Jose Guerra Cabrera, president of the Nicaraguan Freight
Transportation Federation, said they had no option but to strike.
</P>
<P>
"Should the article on tax exemptions be eliminated, the people
would be the biggest losers because it is the people who have to
pay the costs of operation and fares would rise immediately," he
said.
</P>
<P>
If the government does not approve the controversial clause on
tax exemptions, the operators threaten to take stronger
measures. These included blocking the National Assembly and the
President's Office with vehicles, and launching protest marches
throughout the country, Guerra Cabrera added.
</P>
<P>
The national strike has the support of the agricultural sector,
tourism, fisheries, industrial and trade corporations and other
organizations that will also be affected if tax exemptions are not
approved.
</P>
<P>
This is the fifth strike to be staged by transport operators in
Nicaragua during Violeta Barrios de Chamorro's administration.

KIEV, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
today announced a crackdown on organized crime such as the
illegal sale of military technology abroad by stepping up law
enforcement.

Inadequate laws and law enforcement has led to ever-increasing

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- China's foreign trade in hi-tech
products has been growing at an annual rate of up to 40 percent
during the past decade.
</P>
<P>
According to latest statistics provided by the State Science
and Technology Commission, China's foreign trade in hi-tech
products totaled 27 billion US dollars in 1994, 5.1 times over the
5.22 billion US dollars in 1985.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The country's trade in hi-tech products increased to 9.65
billion US dollars in 1990, an increase of nearly 83.9 percent
over the 1985 figure.
</P>
<P>
The trade grew even faster during 1991-1994, with the growth
rate reaching 27.6 percent in 1991, 19.4 percent in 1992, 40
percent in 1993 and 30.9 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
China set up 52 hi-tech industrial zones across the country in
early 1990s, offering preferential treatment and investment
environment to investors in hi-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
China's imports of computers and products related to
telecommunications, the leading products in the country's trade in
hi-tech products, reached 7.2 billion US dollars in 1994, while
the export volume was worth 3.54 billion US dollars, about 56
percent of the hi-tech products exported.
</P>
<P>
Other major export and import hi-tech goods were products
involving computer integrated manufacturing equipment,
electronics, aviation and space equipment.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Japan, and Germany are the country's three
largest hi-tech product trade partners, with which China imported
more than it exported.
</P>
<P>
Hi-tech product trade volume between China and the US totalled
6.69 billion US dollars in 1994, while China's export to US
reached 1.22 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Trade between China and Japan in hi-tech products amounted to
5.9 billion US dollars in 1994 and China exported 680 million US
dollars' worth of hi-tech goods to Japan in the same year.
</P>
<P>

hi-tech product, with trade volume totalling 3.2 billion US
dollars in 1994, followed by Taiwan region and Germany.
</P>

percent of the country's total, followed by Shanghai, 2.7 billion
US dollars, Beijing, 2.68 billion US dollars, Liaoning province,
1.39 billion US dollars and Fujian province, 1.02 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the percentage of China's hi-tech trade volume in
the country's foreign trade is very small (about five percent in
1994), though its trade in hi-tech products grows rapidly.
</P>
<P>
They say China's hi-tech industry is still at its primary stage
and its hi-tech products are not very competitive.

<P>
CHONGQING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- A World Bank loan of 42 million
US dollars will be used to treat industrial pollution in the
mountainous city of Chongqing in southwest China's Sichuan
Province.
</P>
<P>
The loan will be spent on shutting down two open-hearth
furnaces at the Chongqing Iron and Steel Works, and building a
60-ton superhigh-power direct current electric furnace, which will
have an annual production capacity of 300,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The iron and steel works is one of the main sources of
pollution in mountain-locked Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
The two 40-ton open-hearth furnaces are technically out-dated,
posing a severe threat to the environment.
</P>
<P>
After the pollution treatment project is completed, the annual
amount of suspended particles in the air over the area will be
reduced by 3,789 tons, and the drinking water quality will also be
improved.

<HEADLINE> Cars Blamed For Greenhouse Gas Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Australia has yet to improve
efficiency of its transport and energy industries to meet
international obligations of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
The newly released National Greenhouse Inventory by the
Australian Government showed that motor vehicles and electricity
generation contributed the major part of the increase in carbon
dioxide emissions during 1990-1994.
</P>
<P>
The inventory showed that cars, light trucks and aircraft
accounted for nearly all the increase in transport-related
greenhouse emissions, while emissions from power plants rose four
percent during 1990-94. In combination, transport and energy
sectors accounted for nearly half of the nation's total emissions
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The inventory revealed that Australia's greenhouse gas
emissions grew to 576 million tones of carbon dioxide equivalent
in 1994 from 563 million tones in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The increase of emissions from the energy sector was due to
greater demand for electricity by the expanding production and
exports of minerals and metals. Above 80 percent of electricity in
Australia was generated by coal firing, which produces large
amount of carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
Carbon dioxide and methane are believed to build up in the
atmosphere and trap heat from the sun to cause global warming.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Minister for Environment Robert Hill is to use
the inventory to demonstrate Australia's "unique" situation at the
international meeting on climate change in Geneva next week. He
said that Australia would have difficulty to undertake mandatory
target of greenhouse emission reduction because this would damage
the country's economic and trade interests.
</P>
<P>
"We have already stated that we will insist that the outcome of
the current international negotiations on climate change
safeguards Australia's particular economic and trade interests,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, emissions from farming and heavy industry
have been reduced due to greater energy efficiency in the past few
years. Heavy industry reduced emissions by an average of five
percent each year since 1990, while farming industry slashed its
methane emission by 2.3 percent over four years, the inventory
showed.
</P>
<P>
However, Australia has much to do to improve its energy
efficiency in all industries. The inventory showed that
three-fourths of net increase in greenhouse gas was from
emissions. The remaining one-fourth was due to reduction of carbon
absorption as a result of deforestation.

<HEADLINE> Student Loan Program Helps Pay College Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province will spend 60 million yuan establishing a program to help
financially burdened students finish college, today's "China
Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The program is expected to train more talented students who
will aid the province's economic development, said provincial
Governor Wen Shizhen.
</P>
<P>
Starting this year, Liaoning students in province-managed
colleges and universities can get assistance if they need it.
</P>
<P>
After submitting an application, students can borrow money to
pay the first year's tuition, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
They are required to pay the money back within one year of
graduation. Those who are not able to pay the money back on time
can apply to have the deadline postponed.
</P>
<P>
Loan recipients who are willing to work in the province after
graduation only need to pay back half of the money they
received. Those who work in townships will not have to pay any of
it back.
</P>
<P>
Students who enter universities for postgraduate study or go
abroad for further study can return the money after graduation.
</P>
<P>
Since the country began charging tuition fees at colleges and
universities in 1994, some excellent students have been unable to
enter colleges and universities because of their financial burden.
</P>
<P>
The new loan system has been implemented in more than 1,000
colleges and universities across the country.

<HEADLINE> Sinopec Urges Fuel Quality Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, July 10 (Xinhua) --China's major gasoline producer
wants stricter quality control over fuels, China Daily reported
today.
</P>
<P>
China Petrochemicals Corp.(Sinopec), who produces 76 percent of
the quality gasoline in China, suggested that the government more
closely supervise refineries to keep sub-standard products out of
the market.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said 90 percent of gasoline refined in China has
passed muster, but the other 10 percent, often from small,
unlicensed refineries, is of inferior quality.
</P>
<P>
China has 82,000 fuel stations, and Sinopec runs some 10,000 of
them.
</P>
<P>
Sinopec also wants the government to strictly prohibit
sub-standard fuel stations.
</P>
<P>
Sheng Huanren, president of Sinopec, said that his firm's
reputation should not be harmed by findings that some
Chinese-refined fuels were of low quality.
</P>
<P>
The State Technical Supervision Bureau has inspected Sinopec's
enterprises and all their products, including diesel, passed
inspection.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises under Sinopec have strict quality control systems,
said Zhang Deyi, Sinopec's deputy chief engineer.
</P>
<P>
Zhang pointed out that there were 90 small refineries run by
regional authorities across the country.

<HEADLINE> Oviedo to Remain in Jail During Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, July 9 (Xinhua) -- A Paraguayan court decided
today that retired General Lino Cesar Oviedo will remain in jail
during his trial for the crime of rebellion, according to informed
judicial sources.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by Judge Jorge Bogarin, who rejected a
petition from Oviedo's defence. The rejection was based on the
ground that it was inadmissible to approve the petition due to the
gravity of the charges against the military officer.
</P>
<P>
Oviedo created a serious crisis in the Paraguayan democratic
process between April 22-25 when he refused to hand over the army
command and remained in the barracks of the first cavalry division
from where he demanded the resignation of President Juan Carlos
Wasmosy.
</P>
<P>
Oviedo was detained on June 14 and is currently kept in the
Military Justice building of the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
According to prosecutor Heladio Valiente, Oviedo's behavior
should be classified as an act of rebellion, and if he is found
guilty he will be sentenced to 2-6 years in jail or 2-8 years in
exile and be barred from holding any public office for the length
of his sentence.

<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Fenhe Plain in southern Shanxi
has become a leading producer of name-brand apples in China.
</P>
<P>
Every autumn, a long line of trucks, fully loaded with apples,
sets off from Shanxi for various parts of China.
</P>
<P>
The vast orchards in the province have expanded from several
hundred hectares, to last year's 133,000 ha. In 1995, the region
harvested 700 million kg of apples, a 15th of the total apple
output in China.
</P>
<P>
Apples produced in Shanxi are famous for the big size, sweet
taste, bright color and a long storage period.
</P>
<P>
A local agronomist predicted that Shanxi's output of apples is
expected to reach two billion kg by the end of this century,
making up seven or eight percent of the nation's total.
</P>
<P>
A number of apple juice and powder plants have been built to
process apple-made products for export to Southeast Asia and
other parts of the world.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Continue Voicing Developing Countries' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian will continue calling
on the developed countries to understand the economic aspirations
of developing countries in order to narrow the gap between them,
local press reported today quoting a senior government official.
</P>
<P>
Only with such an understanding would the developing countries
be enabled to take part in world economic activities, Industry and
Trade Minister Tunky Ariwibowo said here Tuesday at his ministry.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia would voice the aspirations of developing countries
at every international forum, he said. It would do so at the next
ministerial meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) forum in Christchurch, New Zealand, from July 15 to 16.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia would do the same at a ministerial meeting of
countries affiliated to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in
Singapore in September this year, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He added the world community should admit there were economic
differences among nations in the world, especially between the
developing and developed countries.
</P>
<P>
"Such differences should actually be overcome by understanding
every measures taken by developing countries. The most important
thing is that the measures remain consistent with WTO's
regulations," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said economic equality should be attained first before trade
liberalization could be introduced. This principle was agreed to
by WTO members in Marrakech, Morocco, in 1994, he added.
</P>
<P>
Without equality, he said, it would be impossible for
developing countries to compete in the upcoming free trade era.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that industrialized nations would
help developing countries like Indonesia in mastering technology
and gaining wider access to world markets.

ATLANTA, July 9 (Xinhua/OANA) -- While most athletes will come
to Atlanta for medals, 32-year-old distance runner Majed Abu
Marahil simply wants to show the world how his country has changed.
</P>
<P>
Abu Marahil will be the leading athlete to represent the
Palestinians at the Olympics as flag-bearer for a three-man team
from the Gaza Strip and West Bank, where 2 million Palestinians
live.
</P>
<P>
Abu Marahil said that he hoped the Palestinian presence here
could remind people of the recent strides for peace and the goal
of an independent nation.
</P>
<P>
"We were at war then. Now is a new day and the Palestinian
people and the Israeli people must learn to live together," he
said, refering to the 1972 Olympic Games where 11 Israeli athletes
were killed by the eight Palestinian terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Like Abu Marahil, team member Ehab Salama is also from Gaza
Strip. He is the fastest man in the Gaza Strip over the distance
of 5,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
Lightweight boxer Rashid Judeh makes up the third member of the
Palestinian team. He left the Middle East last year to train in
California and is considered the Palestinian team's best hope amid
slim prospects for an Olympic medal.

<HEADLINE> Anhui Discovers 2,000-Year-Old Han Dynasty Tomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, July 10 (Xinhua) -- A tomb dating back more than 2,000
years ago has been discovered in Fangwanggang, Caohu City in east
China's Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
It is the largest tomb of the Han Dynasty (206 B.C.--A.D. 220)
ever discovered in the province, according to experts from the
provincial archeology department. A marquis is believed to have
been buried in the tomb.
</P>
<P>
The tomb measures nine meters from east to west, seven meters
from south to north and three meters deep, covering an area of
some 60 sq m.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 artifacts have been brought to the light,
including wood articles, porcelain, bronze ware and clay
articles. Some of them have never been previously discovered in
Anhui, and archeologists know neither their name nor function of
the items.

<HEADLINE> Big Companies Fall Victim to Scalper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 9 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Some prominent Atlanta
companies are among the burned and embarrassed clients of a New
Jersy scalper who took their money for hot Olympic tickets and
then filed for bankruptcy protection, local reports said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Court records show that officials with Wachovia Bank,
Ciba-Geigy and a unit of Coca-Cola Enterprises are on the
scalper's client list, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.
</P>
<P>
The price was high: Some customers shelled out nearly 4,000
dollars for a pair of opening ceremonies tickets with a face value
of 636 each. One California travel agent paid nearly 80,000
dollars for Olympic tickets and accommodations meant for a
clientele that includes foreign government officials.
</P>
<P>
It's no secret that some of the nation's biggest corporation
are clients of professional scalpers with a knack for landing
hard-to-get tickets, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Georgia's anti-scalping law generally prohibits selling most
tickets for more than face value. By doing so, scalpers put
themselves in danger and customers in embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
Some clients have privately acknowleged the incident left them
embarrassed.

<HEADLINE> Two Austrian Mountain Climbers Die in Peru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Two Austrian mountain climbers who
were scaling the nearly inaccessible snow-capped Yerupaja of the
Huayhuash Cordillera, died on July 5 when they were swept away and
buried by an avalanche of snow, informed the "El Comercio" paper
today.
</P>
<P>
The snow-capped Yerupaja rises 6,632 meters above sea level and
is located in the province of Bolognesi, some 350 kilometers
southeast of Huaraz.
</P>
<P>
The brothers, Steven and Nicholas Clabus, 23 and 25 years of
age, were climbing up the Yerupaja, the most dangerous of that
cordillera, accompanied by another 5 climbers from their country.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred at 10:00 a.m. July 5 when the
expedition was only 1,000 meters from the mountain peak. At
that moment, an avalanche of snow buried the 2 brothers.
</P>
<P>
The bodies of the 2 mountain climbers has not been recovered
yet because of the bad weather and the inaccessibility of the
snow-capped mountain.
</P>
<P>
This is the second serious accident in the area this season. A
North American who was climbing the northern peak of the
snow-capped Huascaran died 15 days ago.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment in US Reaches 54.4 Bln Dlrs in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Foreign direct investments in
the United States totaled 54.4 billion dollars last year, marking
the continuous growth for the third straight year in this country.
</P>
<P>
In its recently released annual report on foreign investment,
the U.S. Commerce Department said direct spending by foreigners to
acquire or establish U.S. businesses shot up 19.2 percent from a
revised 1994 level of 45.6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, in spite of the fact that the overall investment
marked the third straight annual increase, in percentage terms it
was far below the great jumps of 74 percent in 1994 and 71 percent
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Still, the advance pushed total investment for the year to the
highest level since 1990, when foreigners spent 65.9 billion
dollars acquiring U.S. business operations. The all-time high for
foreign investment in the U.S. was 72.7 billion dollars, set in
1988.
</P>
<P>
German companies recorded more than a fourfold increase last
year, pushing that country's total to 14.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
For 1995, Japanese investment totaled 3.8 billion dollars, only
one-fifth of the country's 1990 peak of 19.9 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Britain was in second place last year with direct investment in
the United States totaling 9.7 billion dollars, a drop of 44
percent from its 1994 total.
</P>
<P>
Canada was ranked the third with new direct investment of 6.5
billion dollars, a 57 percent jump from 1994.
</P>
<P>
The government report attributed last year's overall increase
in part to a falling dollar. The dollar dropped to record lows
against both the Japanese yen and German mark in the early part of
the year. It also attributed part of the jump in foreign spending
last year to record-high levels for corporate profits, which
attracted overseas investors.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Netanyahu Unable to Close Rift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed today to their
disagreements over several issues concerning the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference after two-hour talks held in the
White House, both Clinton and Netanyahu acknowledged that there
exist "disagreements" and "differences" on approaches towards the
final peace goals in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president, who supported Israel's Labor leader Shimon
Peres during last month's Israeli election, has found Netanyahu is
on a track different to that of Peres, and was anxious to pull the
unruly Likud leader back on track, but in vain.
</P>
<P>
Still, trying to prod the peace process, Clinton told the press
conference, "The tide of history cannot be turned. Going back
would be a bad mistake."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, a hardline rightist, said that he would be committed
to Middle East peace but peace should be under security instead of
trading land for that as Clinton has proposed.
</P>
<P>
He said he put security first and was not as eager as his
predecessor to speed the peace process while Clinton stood stiffly
beside, listening to his statement.
</P>
<P>
As regards direct talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
as was regularly held by former Israeli Prime Minister Peres and
pressed by the United States, Netanyahu suggested that he is in no
hurry to meet him, saying: "I said that if I deem it necessary for
peace, or for the interest of Israel to meet Arafat, I won't rule
it out and I have not changed my position."
</P>
<P>
He flatly rejected negotiations with Syria because of what he
alleged "Syrian-controlled" terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
"The first item on my agenda would be the cessation of all
terrorist attacks from Syrian-controlled areas in Lebanon, via
Hezbollah, or, for that matter, other terrorist attacks from
groups based in Syria. And I think it's only right."
</P>
<P>
While Netanyahu showed some conciliation in general terms on
the Middle East peace process, he is non-commital on the key issue
of Israel's withdrawal from Hebron where 400 Jews live among
100,000 Arabs, a commitment made by his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
"We want to live up to the agreements, but we can't be the only
side to do so," he said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu was said to have brought to the White House a list of
alleged Palestinian peace-accord violations to justify his
reluctance of redeploying Israeli troops in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The two-hour White House meeting has narrowed not an inch of
gap existing between the United States and Israel, only making
their differences stick out much more.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Grateful to OAU Support for 2nd Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali said today he was touched by the endorsement
of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) for his second
five-year term.
</P>
<P>
The OAU, which is meeting in Yaounda, Cameroon, for a three-day
summit meeting, officially recommended Boutros Boutros-Ghali for a
second term in a declaration released today.
</P>
<P>
The declaration reaffirmed the historic importance of the
election of an African as secretary-general of the United Nations,
and praised what Boutros-Ghali had done in the office after
January 1, 1992.
</P>
<P>
"As an African, Dr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the
secretary-general of the United Nations, has been personally
touched by the support of Africa which encourages him to pursue
his efforts for peace and development and for a strong and great
Africa," said a statement released in the U.N. headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The United States has threatened to veto the reappointment of
the 73-year-old Egyptian for a second five-year term, saying that
Boutros-Ghali has become an obstacle towards U.N. reform.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton Administration was not happy with his hesitation to
approve the nomination of Joseph Cornnor, an American professor,
to head the U.N. management department, to establish an internal
oversight office on waste and abuse of power and to approve the
1996-1997 zero growth budget.

<HEADLINE> Census Shows 700,000 Refugees in Serbia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 9 (Xinhua) -- A recent census has shown that
there were 700,000 refugees from former Yugoslav republics now
living in Serbia, according to the Serbian refugee commissioner.
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Bratislava Morina told Belgrade Radio today that
of this number, 430,000 were refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina
which had a three-and-half-year-long war.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav government previously said there were 670,000
refugees living in Yugoslavia, which consists of Serbia and
Montenegro, but international humanitarian organizations had
believed the number of refugees in Yugoslavia was far less than
the government estimates.
</P>
<P>
Morina said that the refugees would be provided with facilities
in Yugoslavia to vote in the coming elections in
Bosnia-Herzegovina in September.
</P>
<P>
She added that the census, which began two months ago, was
still going on, since many of the refugees, for reasons of
misinformation, had not shown up to be counted in the official
part.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner described as disheartening reports from
Croatia about a slow return of Serbs to the territory of the
former Republic of Serb Krajina and Western Slavonia, where more
than 300,000 Serbs had been displaced in the summer of 1995.
</P>
<P>
She said only a handful of people had returned to those areas
so far and their return had not been organized. She also urged the
international community to put more pressure on Zagreb to
facilitate their repatriation.
</P>
<P>
A total of 600,000 Serbs have moved out of Croatia since its
secession from former Yugoslavia and the outbreak of the crisis in
1991.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Rise on Lower Bond Market Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Encouraged by falling bond market
interest rates, stock investors resumed buying today, looking for
bargains among shares that had declined heavily in the past four
straight sessions.
</P>
<P>
Some encouraging second-quarter earnings reports helped support
the market, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 31.03 to 5,581.86. In
the four previous sessions, Wall Street's best-known indicator
tumbled 179.15 points, or 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 4 to 3 on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 379.20 million
shares, up from 366.10 million Monday.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index gained 1.24 to 351.57. The Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.21 to 654.75 while the Nasdaq
composite index rose 4.15 to 1,152.98.
</P>
<P>
At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index was 2.24
points lower at 566.67.
</P>
<P>
Stock traders took their cues from the Treasury bond market,
where interest rates spiked upward Friday after a June employment
report showed much stronger job growth than economists predicted.
</P>
<P>
Today, the bond market rallied, sending its rates downward, and
that helped spur stock buying. Interest-sensitive bank stocks,
which fell Monday, rebounded today.
</P>
<P>
Stocks were also supported by early second-quarter financial
reports, according to market analysts.

<HEADLINE> Weak Growth Predicted for Canada's Economy in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- A stronger-than-expected domestic
economy in the first quarter did not make up for a surprisingly
weak export performance and the result is a slightly weaker
outlook this year, according to the Summer 1996 Canadian Outlook.
</P>
<P>
It forecast Canadian economic growth of 1.7 percent this year,
down slightly from the 1.9 percent projection in the spring
forecast.
</P>
<P>
Canadian growth for 1997 remains unchanged at 2.6 percent,
according to the outlook, which was released here today by the
Conference Board of Canada.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking for growth to gradually accelerate through the
near term, as exports continue to be the main source of economic
growth," said the board's Vice-President and Chief Economist Jim
Frank.
</P>
<P>
"Severe fiscal restraint remains the major source of weakness.
It's clear now that all provinces are committed to improving their
fiscal situations," he said.
</P>
<P>
The current outlook includes rising interest rates based on
anticipated interest rate increases in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Real consumer spending is projected to grow by 2.0 percent this
year and 2.4 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"The most serious problem with the outlook for retail sales
comes from the precarious state of household finances," Frank
said, adding that with households stretching to the limit, there
is little hope for any sharp rebound in spending in the near term.
</P>
<P>
However, the outlook did point to some positive forces that
should help to generate moderate growth in real consumer spending
over the short term, including Ontario province's personal income
tax cut and the 1.2 billion U.S. dollar payment to the owners of
Prairie farmland in compensation for elimination of grain
transportation subsidy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, housing markets have finally shown signs of a
significant rebound in recent months, the outlook reported.
</P>
<P>
"The sense that interest rates may be on the way up tends to
trigger a temporary surge in house buying," Frank said.
</P>
<P>
However, subdued employment and income growth, combined with
higher interest rates, will limit the rebound, he noted.

<HEADLINE> UN: Angola Parties Have Taken Steps to Meet Timetable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- U.N. spokeswoman Sylvana Foa
said today that as the Security Council is preparing to renew the
U.N. Angola mission Thursday, the Angolan government and the
rebel UNITA are also taking steps to meet their agreed timetable.
</P>
<P>
"Representatives of the government and UNITA began talks on
constitutional amendments necessary for the formation of
government of unity and national reconciliation," she said, adding
that discussions for another meeting between the Angolan president
and UNITA head are taking place now.
</P>
<P>
As regards the long delayed quartering of UNITA soldiers, Foa
said that as of Monday, out of the UNITA's declared strength of
62,500, the U.N. has quartered 52,857. Of those, 5,889 have
deserted, she explained.
</P>
<P>
"We also have 62,000 family members being accommodated in
satellite camps, near the quartering sites," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said that there has been some improvement in the quality of
surrendered weapons.
</P>
<P>
"Last week, we got three tanks, four APCs, 83 broken radios.
But we feel that UNITA still withhold heavy weapons and probably
the best military units," she added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council is expected to renew U.N. Angola
Verification Mission III (UNAVEM III) for another three months
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
UNAVEM III, which has 7,282 troops, is now the biggest
peacekeeping operation of the world organization.
</P>
<P>
It was established to help implement an agreement signed in
Lusaka, Zambia, in November 1994, ending nearly two decades of
civil war between the Angolan government and former rebels of the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola.

<HEADLINE> "Palenstinian People Are Suffering", Says Araft by Guo Ming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 9 (Xinhua) -- "The people of the holy land are
suffering," Palestinian President Yassir Arafat said here today,
warning the new Israeli hardline stance is "demolishing the whole
peace process" in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The words were solomnly and slowly enunciated by Arafat in an
interview with Xinhua in his hotel room in Yaounde just hours
before he left for Morocco for talks with King Moulay Hassan ii.
Arafat was in the Cameroonian capital for the 32nd Summit of the
Organisation of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
"The continuation of the Israeli policy of encirclement,
closure, unemployment and economic strangling which our people
are suffering from, may well sweep away peace efforts and
demolish the whole peace process," Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
"This has led to the loss of six to seven million US dollars
per day in our country," said the Palestinian leader.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the new policy declared by the Israeli
government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Natanyahu, leader of
the hardline Lykud party who was narrowly elected in the general
election on May 29.
</P>
<P>
On the prospects of the negotiations between the Israeli
government and the Palestinian authority, Arafat said: "We
respect the choice of the Israeli people, and we hope they will
continue the peace process which was started in Madrid, Oslo,
Cairo and Washington."
</P>
<P>
"We hope they reflect on the tragedy of Hebron, stop the
settlement, and lease the prisoners, especially the female
prisoners," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process had made a breakthrough in 1994
with the signing of the Oslo peace accord, and given another big
push in 1995 when Arafat was democratically elected the
Palestinian president.
</P>
<P>
However, measures of the land confistication, the expansion of
Israeli settlements, the non-release of captives and prisoners,
the slowing down of the retreat from Hebron on the part of the
Israeli government, have all constituted the obstacles for
palenstinian people's access to the peace divident, according to
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinian leader gave his "heart-felt thanks"
to the African leaders and people for their continuous unwaiving
support to the Palestinian, or rather, the Arab cause.
</P>
<P>
"This is something that we will never forget," said the Arab
hero.
</P>
<P>
"The situatin calls upon the international community and all
sister states and friends like you who are the real friends of
our people, to employ every possible pressure and effort to save
the peace process from reaching a dead-end peace," said Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said during his two-day stay in Yaounde, he had held
talks with many African leaders and shared their joys and pains.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the 64th OAU Council of Ministers meeting which ended
on Saturday, passed two resolutions on the question of palestine
and on Middle East, voicing support to the Palestinian authority
led by Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader also expressed his support to Boutros
Boutros-Ghali in his contest for the second term of his office as
secretary general of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"He is the son of Africa. And he is the friend of the
Palestinian people," said Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The OAU summit earlier today adopted a resolution accepting
Ghali as the candidate representing the African continent for the
UN post.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also gave high credit to the Sino-Palestinian
relationships, saying: "we won't forget our Chinese friends who
lent us a hand when we were in the most difficult sitution."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian president described his recent trip to China
as "very fruitful", adding that the Palestinian people and he
personally appreciated the "very close relationships" between
China and Palestine. enditem

<HEADLINE> International Planned Parenthood Federation Urges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The International Planned Parenthood
Federation (IPPF) urged the global community here today to take
action on sexual and reproductive health care.
</P>
<P>
"World leaders should live up to the promises made at recent
international conferences by incorporating sexual and reproductive
health care into their national policies and by allocating the
necessary funding to make these promises a reality," IPPF
President Dr. Attiya Inayatullah told a press conference in
commemoration of World Population Day on July 11.
</P>
<P>
Through the U.N.-sponsored conferences in the past few years,
particularly the International Conference on Population and
Development in Cairo and the Fourth World Conference on Women in
Beijing, the international community has signaled its rights as
important and necessary components of sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
Despite promises made almost two years ago at the Cairo
conference of 17 billion U.S. dollars by the year 2000 for
population-related activities, family planning and sexual and
reproductive health continue to be viewed by most countries as a
consumer sector for which a few dollars are reluctantly spent.
</P>
<P>
Family planning receives less than 2 percent of all government
health spending in the developing world and less than 2 percent of
all international aid.
</P>
<P>
"Without political commitment from national governments and
financial pledges from international donor countries, women, men
and children throughout the world will continue to suffer
needlessly," she said.
</P>
<P>
This year nearly 600,000 women will die from problems
associated with pregnancy and childbirth, nearly 15 million
teenage girls will give birth and there will be 20 million unsafe
abortions performed.
</P>
<P>
Making high-quality family planning and reproductive health
care services available to those in need is one of the most
effective and inexpensive ways to eliminate much of this suffering
and improve the quality of life for people everywhere.
</P>
<P>
"It is known that meeting only the existing demand for family
planning could prevent as many as 200,000 deaths from pregnancy
and childbirth," said Dr. Inayatullah. "For less than 500 million
