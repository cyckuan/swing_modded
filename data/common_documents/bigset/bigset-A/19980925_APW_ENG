Singapore Airlines reinstates special maid fares for Manila route
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's flagship airline has reinstated a
popular discounted fare for Filipino maids working in the island
republic one day after scrapping it, according to a statement from
the carrier on Friday.
	   After Philippines Airlines ceased operations on Wednesday,
handing Singapore Airlines (SIA) a monopoly on the busy route, the
carrier effectively doubled all its fares to Manila by eliminating
existing discounts and said the special deals for the maids would
also go.
	   But the Friday statement reversed the unpopular decision, which
would have burdened the estimated 100,000 Filipino maids in
Singapore and their employers with airfare three times the price of
the special deal.
	   ``SIA recognizes that Singapore households who employ Filipino
maids have contractual obligations to provide air travel for their
maids and has therefore retained the special fare,'' said the
statement.
	   The previously published maids' fare of 380 Singapore dollars
(dlrs 222) for a one-way ticket and 480 Singapore dollars (dlrs
280) for return passage would remain ``for the present time,'' the
airline said.
	   But the discounted fare for all other economy-class travelers
will not be reinstated, it added. ``SIA is closely monitoring the
situation and will keep discounted fares under review.''
	   One-way tickets from Singapore to the Philippine capital rose to
810 Singapore dollars (dlrs 473) from about 400 Singapore dollars
(dlrs 233).
	   Round-trip airfare shot up to 1,206 Singapore dollars (dlrs 704)
from a previous average level of about 630 Singapore dollars (dlrs
368).

Death toll rises in Dominican Republic from Hurricane Georges

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Rescue workers in the
Dominican Republic have recovered at least 80 more bodies, pushing
the death toll from Hurricane Georges' deadly march across the
Caribbean to at least 250.
	   Armed forces chief Ruben Paulino Alvarez said Thursday night
that 125 were known dead in the Dominican Republic, with another
156 missing.
	   That death toll apparently did not include another 76 bodies
which Red Cross official Angel Almanzar said were recovered
Thursday by workers in San Juan de la Maguana, a town 120 miles
(195 kilometers) west of the capital, Santo Domingo.
	   In Manomatuey, where a shelter was washed away Wednesday, three
more bodies were pulled from the muck to bring the toll there to at
least eight. And along the capital's seaside boulevard, a woman's
bloated, blanched body washed ashore.
	   Meanwhile, the hurricane continued its onslaught in the
Caribbean. The hurricane crossed over Cuba on Thursday afternoon
and was threatening the Florida Keys. In the United States, the
National Weather Service was referring to Georges as ``the
hurricane that just won't die.''
	   Bad news kept coming from throughout the region: 42 dead in
Haiti, three each in Puerto Rico and St. Kitts and two each in Cuba
and Antigua. Everywhere, storm victims struggled to find water,
food, ice and other bare essentials to cope with loss and the
tropical heat.
	   In the Dominican Republic, Thursday was the day of the country's
patron saint, Virgen Mercedes. Residents crammed churches to pray
for hurricane victims.
	   At the Mercedes Church in Santo Domingo, the Rev. Jose Arellano
Guerrero read the names of the dead from tiny scraps of paper
before 1,000 worshippers.
	   Among the faithful was Carmela Hernandez, 80, who lost three
fingers when the storm blew a door shut onto her right hand.
	   ``I came to see the Mass because I am devoted to the virgin,''
said Hernandez, wearing a bloodied bandage. ``It gives me peace.''
Suddenly, she doubled over in pain and had to leave.
	   Arellano said this year's traditional street procession was
canceled because downed power lines and broken tree limbs made it
too dangerous.
	   The death toll continued to mount, and hundreds were still
missing since Georges' 110 mph (178 kph) winds swept through this
nation on Tuesday.
	   Rescuers searched frantically throughout the Dominican Republic
for more victims and army helicopters and a U.S. Coast Guard C-130
airplane and helicopter combed the countryside to assess the
damage.
	   More than 100,000 people lost homes, said President Leonel
Fernandez. Airports in La Romana and Puerto Plata were severely
damaged.
	   Throughout Santo Domingo people wandered with empty plastic jugs
searching for water to drink. Many had to settle for filthy brown
river water.
	   The Red Cross prepared to deliver aid to the needy, and army
soldiers patrolled the capital with rifles to deter looting that
surged during the storm. More than 100 people were arrested late
Wednesday and early Thursday for curfew violations, local
television reports said.
	   Curfews also were in effect in St. Kitts and the U.S. Virgin
Islands. In St. Kitts, 85 percent of homes were damaged or
destroyed, schools and hospitals were damaged, and half the crucial
sugar crop was lost. Some 3,000 were homeless.
	   In Cuba, the government reported two people were electrocuted
when they touched live wires downed in the storm, the Mexican news
agency Notimex said. Coffee, cacao and banana crops also were
damaged, and nearly 20,000 homes were flooded in Holguin province.
	   In Puerto Rico, hundreds were still homeless on Thursday, a
near-total blackout persisted and 28,000 were in shelters. In
addition, the storm left dlrs 2 billion in damage and wiped out
hundreds of homes.
	   Hundreds of federal and local workers began repairing power
lines, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers provided ice, water and
tanker trucks.
	   In Haiti, the U.N. Development Program donated dlrs 100,000 for
disaster relief, and the U.S. government donated water, food,
blankets, sheets and clothing. France sent a 60-member security
team to help with water purification and to treat the injured.

	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ A series of explosions ripped
through parts of Esso's gas plant near the town of Sale in
southeast Victoria state on Friday afternoon. Officials said seven
people were injured, one critically.
	   The ambulance service said the critically person had extensive
facial and body burns and was being airlifted to Melbourne.
	   The other six all have burn injuries, but the ambulance
spokesman said none were life-threatening.
	   Esso said they could not comment yet.
	   A large fire was burning at the Garretts Road plant in Sale,
about 110 miles (180 km) east of Melbourne.
	   A police spokesman said the cause of the explosions, which went
off before 1 p.m., was not known.
	   The Country Fire Authority (CFA) described the fire as major.
	   In June, a plug of ice blocked the main supply line into the
plant, which is Victoria's major source of natural gas.
	   State-wide restriction were imposed at the time, forcing factory
closures in 100 industry sectors at an estimated cost of 50 million
Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 29 million).

Four face trial for spreading rumors on Internet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Four people will face trail on
charges of spreading riot rumors via the Internet, an offense that
carries a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment.
	   The four, including one woman, were the first to be arrested in
Malaysia for such a crime. They were arraigned in separate courts
Thursday.
	   All were released on bail after more than one month in jail, the
New Straits Times newspaper said Friday.
	   The arrests followed an investigation into rumors of violence in
August that sparked off panic buying of food, and forced many to
rush home from work and bolt their doors.
	   Of the four accused, three were computer specialists and one a
bank manager. The arrests sparked a debate in Malaysia over freedom
of speech and the right to privacy on the information superhighway.
	   Cyber sleuths at Mimos Co., which brings the Internet to the
bulk of Malaysia's 200,000 subscribers, tracked down an unsigned
e-mail that warned of the widespread purchase of machetes by
migrant Indonesian workers.
	   The country's largest Internet service provider later assured
subscribers that it did not routinely monitor electronic mail in a
country that wants to portray itself as Asia's Silicon Valley.
	   Malaysia soon hopes to launch its Multimedia Super Corridor, a
vast area bound by a fiber-optics network, providing links between
high-tech companies, government offices, homes, hotels and even
shopping malls.

Suharto's son-in-law could be court-martialled soon: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A son-in-law of ex-President Suharto
might face a court-martial as early as October for his alleged
involvement in the abductions of pro-democracy activists, a
newspaper reported Friday.
	   Former special forces commander, Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto, who
is married to one of Suharto's daughters, was dismissed from the
armed forces in August after a military inquiry investigated the
kidnappings.
	   The Indonesian Observer quoted military investigator Maj. Gen.
Syamsu Djalaluddin as saying the army would try to hold the
court-martial soon.
	   Further comment from the military was not immediately available.
	   Human rights groups claim that troops under Prabowo's command
kidnapped, interrogated and tortured dozen of anti-Suharto
activists in the months before the old autocrat was forced to step
down in May after a wave of protests and riots.
	   Most were released after their ordeal but 14 are still listed as
missing. Some fear they are dead.
	   Ten soldiers are preparing to face courts-martials over the
abduction.
	   Before Suharto's resignation Prabowo enjoyed a fast rise to the
top of the ranks. But his career nose dived when the ex-leader left
office and the army promised to clean up its human rights record.

New plans to strengthen fight against fish resource piracy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAY LILLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) - New plans to tackle pirate
fishing vessels illegally poaching tens of thousands of tons of
Antarctic toothfish are to be put to a marine resource meeting in
Australia next month, the Foreign Ministry said Friday.
	   Associate Foreign Minister Simon Upton provided no details, but
officials told The Associated Press any response was likely to stop
short of naval interception as Antarctica's Ross Sea area is part
of the Antarctic demilitarized region.
	   Both France and Australia have used gunboats to arrest as many
as 10 illegal fishing vessels in their southern ocean territorial
waters in the past two years.
	   With the pirate fleet depleting stocks in some waters,
``unregulated toothfish fishing in the Ross Sea this summer is a
possibility New Zealand is taking seriously,'' Upton said. Pressure
would rise as poachers fished out other toothfish grounds.
	   New Zealand claims guardianship of the 370,000 square miles
(958,000 sq. km.) of the Ross Sea Dependency, a fresh target for
the estimated 80 pirate boats in the fleet fishing for the prized
Antarctic toothfish.
	   ``The pressure on toothfish stocks is parts of the Southern
Ocean doesn't appear to be diminishing. The Ross Sea could provide
a tempting target for the poachers as they fish out grounds
elsewhere,'' Upton said.
	   He said the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine
Living Resources (CCAMLR) has reported 130,000 metric tons of
toothfish worth up to 600 million New Zealand dollars (U.S. dlrs
300 million) has been caught illegally by the pirate fleet in the
past two years.
	   The 24 member nations of CCAMLR are working to strengthen its
ability ``to deal with illegal and unregulated fishing throughout
the Southern Ocean,'' Upton told AP.
	   ``The credibility of CCAMLR is on the line,'' he said. ``We are
disappointed at the growing evidence that companies and nationals
associated with countries which are parties to CCAMLR are behind
much of the toothfish plunder.''
	   Pirate vessels from CCAMLR countries, flying flags of
convenience to disguise their country of origin, have been
identified as part of the toothfish fleet.
	   Some reports suggest the area around South Africa's Marion and
Prince Edward Islands already has been fished out.
	   This has forced the trawlers to head east to the French islands
of Glen Crozet and Kerguelen, just north of the Southern Ocean, and
on to Australia's Heard and McDonald Islands.
	   The pirate fleet, which uses sophisticated tracking, catching
and even sea catch transfer systems to disguise fish origins, began
pursing the toothfish in 1996 in South Atlantic waters off
Argentina and South Georgia Island, until British patrol vessels
chased them away.
	   The fishing fleet then moved east toward Namibia and South
Africa, until South African authorities applied pressure.
	   France's sub-Antarctic islands of Crozet and Kerguelen were
next, until French marines operating from patrol boats seized three
poaching ships in March 1997. The poaching fleet then moved on to
Australian waters.
	   Toothfish is highly prized in Japan, where it is known as
``mero,'' and sells about 1,700 yen a kilo (U.S. dlrs 6 a pound).
	   Japan imports 12,000 tons of toothfish a year, some 80 percent
of the global catch.
	   Upton said it is feared New Zealand's sub-Antarctic and
Antarctic waters may be targeted this summer season.
	   New Zealand used P3 Orion air force surveillance flights last
summer to check pirates were not intruding into the southern ocean
areas.

Report: Viagra black market for ``very rich or very desperate'' in
</HEADLINE>
Singapore

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A black market for the impotence drug Viagra is
growing in Singapore as the pills are smuggled in from overseas,
The Straits Times reported Friday.
	   ``Those who buy are either very rich or very desperate,'' Dr.
David Tan, a general practitioner whose patients have admitted to
buying Viagra for 100 Singapore dollars (dlrs 58) a pill, told the
newspaper.
	   Singapore has conducted trials on the drug, but is still in the
process of deciding whether to approve its use in the strictly
regimented, conservative city-state.
	   Meanwhile, Viagra remains a sought after commodity. Men who buy
the blue pills abroad are selling them to friends, and even
peddling them in Singapore's red light districts, according to the
newspaper.
	   A urologist at a Singapore hospital told the daily that he has
seen one to two patients every week over the past four months who
admitted they were already using the drug. Other doctors say their
patients have purchased Viagra in the United States and Thailand,
where it has been approved.
	   The Singapore government has warned that those caught importing
Viagra for sale or distribution will be prosecuted. But Health
Minister Yeo Cheow Tong said last month that ``there is nothing we
can do about'' Singaporeans who bring the drug home from abroad for
personal use.
	   A 54-year old retired Singapore man who bought 150 tablets in
Hawaii was arrested in mid-August for illegally importing,
possessing and selling Viagra.
	   Those who sell illegal medicines face a maximum punishment of
two years in prison and a 5,000 Singapore dollar (dlrs 2,917) fine.

	   A police spokesman said the cause of the explosions, which went
off before 1 p.m., was not known.
	   Esso spokesman Ron Webb said, ``A team has been deployed -- both
internally and externally -- to control the situation.''
	   He said all non-essential personnel had been evacuated from the
site and everyone was accounted for.
	   ``We have shut (down) gas and crude oil production as a
precautionary measure,'' Webb said.
	   ``As soon as the emergency is controlled we'll recommence
operations,'' he said.
	   Some Esso personnel were helping the Country Fire Authority
fight the fire, he said.
	   In June, a plug of ice blocked the main supply line into the
plant, which is Victoria's major source of natural gas.
	   State-wide restriction were imposed at the time, forcing factory
closures in 100 industry sectors at an estimated cost of 50 million
Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 29 million).

	   In Los Angeles, Milwaukee's Steve Woodard retired the first 18
batters, but the Los Angeles Dodgers took advantage of first
baseman Mark Loretta's two errors in the eighth inning to beat the
Brewers 4-1.
	   Woodard, 1-7 in his previous nine starts, pitched perfect ball
until Roger Cedeno led off the seventh inning with a home run. It
was Cedeno's first homer since Aug. 16, 1997.
	   Woodard allowed only one hit, struck out three and walked two
before leaving for a pinch-hitter.
	   Chad Fox (1-4) relieved Woodard to start the eighth and Paul
LoDuca hit a leadoff double. Juan Castro bunted in front of the
plate and a charging Loretta bobbled the ball before throwing it
far wide of first base, enabling LoDuca to score.
	   Eric Weaver (2-0) allowed one hit in two innings. Jeff Shaw
pitched the ninth for his 46th save.

Rafter beats Ogorodov to put Australia up 1-0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOWNSVILLE, Australia (AP) _ U.S. Open champion Patrick Rafter
overcame early resistance to move Australia into a 1-0 lead over
Uzbekistan in the Davis Cup World Group qualifying tie Friday.
	   Rafter beat 254th-ranked Oleg Ogorodov 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 in front of
a capacity crowd of 4,900 at the Townsville Entertainment Center.
	   Jason Stoltenberg of Australia played 239th-ranked Vadim
Kutsenko in the second singles match later Friday.
	   Rafter, playing his first match since claiming his second
successive U.S. title, was tested in the opening set by the strong
backhand of Ogorodov.
	   A rusty Rafter made some uncharacteristic volleying errors as he
exchanged breaks with the loping Ogorodov to make it 2-2.
	   But the rowdy Australian crowd then saw Rafter's
serve-and-volley game start to find its range as he broke his
opponent again to take a 3-2 lead.
	   Rafter survived two break points in a marathon eighth game to
hold serve, before closing out the set in 43 minutes with a string
of powerful ground strokes which forced an error-strewn Ogorodov to
drop his serve again.
	   With the first set under his belt, Rafter seemed to have blown
away any cobwebs from his two-week break and he strolled through
the second, breaking Ogorodov in the eighth game to win 6-3 in 30
minutes.
	   The third set was a similar scenario, with Rafter taking a
single break off Ogorodov in the seventh game to take it 6-4.

Government: Suspect in rocket attack on Cambodian leader escaped
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The main suspect in a rocket attack
on Cambodian leader Hun Sen's convoy has escaped, the government
said Friday, though eight people were being detained for
questioning.
	   A rocket-propelled grenade exploded as Hun Sen's convoy was
passing by on a busy road in the northwestern province of Siem Reap
on Thursday. Hun Sen escaped injury, but a 12-year-old boy who was
sitting on the side of the road was killed.
	   ``One man who was present at the scene 10 minutes before the
motorcade came has disappeared,'' said government spokesman Khieu
Kanharith, who refused to disclose the man's identity or his
alleged ties to Hun Sen's opponents. ``We are 70 percent sure that
he is the perpetrator of this attack.''
	   He added that eight men were in custody, but would provide no
other details.
	   Hun Sen _ who has on at least four occasions claimed to be the
victim of an assassination attempt _ immediately accused the
opposition of being behind the failed plot.
	   But Khieu Kanharith cautioned against prematurely laying the
blame on the two main opposition parties _ Prince Norodom
Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party and the Sam Rainsy Party.
	   ``Let the police investigate and make their own conclusions,''
Khieu Kanharith said at a press conference. ``We don't want to
influence public opinion or the investigation.''
	   Thursday's incident took place shortly before 121 elected
lawmakers gathered at the residence of King Norodom Sihanouk for
the opening of the National Assembly. They were then sworn in at
Cambodia's historic Angkor Wat temple. One elected lawmaker was
absent, apparently out of the country.
	   The swearing-in ceremony followed weeks of jousting between the
opposition and Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party, which
captured a slight majority in July 26 parliamentary elections.
	   FUNCINPEC and the Sam Rainsy Party, which together won 58 of 122
seats in the National Assembly, accused Hun Sen of winning through
fraud and intimidation and threatened to boycott parliament.
	   They organized massive street rallies calling for Hun Sen's
ouster, but as the situation threatened to spin out of control, the
opposition agreed to attend.
	   The July elections were held one year after Hun Sen ousted
Ranariddh as his co-premier in a violent coup. It was hoped the
polls would return stability to Cambodia, but the attack showed the
political climate remained as shaky as ever.
	   Parliament will begin regular sessions next week. Hun Sen
returned to the capital immediately after the swearing-in ceremony,
while opposition leader Ranariddh flew to Bangkok, Thailand, on
Friday for undisclosed reasons.

Body of missing British navy crewman found after helicopter crash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The body of a missing British navy crewman who
died after his helicopter crashed into the South China Sea during a
training mission two days ago was found Friday, a British defense
official said.
	   ``We have located the main part of the wreckage and the body of
the crewman,'' Group Captain Christopher Lebas, a defense advisor
at the British High Commission in Singapore, told The Associated
Press.
	   Lebas added that there would be a ``thorough investigation'' by
the Royal Navy into the cause of the crash, which occurred at
Wednesday night about 90 miles (144 kilometers) northeast of
Singapore.
	   The pilot of the Lynx helicopter was recovered shortly after the
accident, and suffered only minor bruises. The weather at the time
was good, and the cause of the mishap remains unknown.
	   The names of the two navy men involved in the accident were not
released.
	   The British helicopter was taking part in a ``night encounter
exercise'' involving three Singapore missile corvettes and
Britain's HMS Grafton.
	   In addition to nine Singapore navy ships, two Singapore aircraft
and a British frigate, a New Zealand ship and two Indonesian patrol
aircraft had joined the search for the missing crewman Thursday.
	   A spokesman for Singapore's Defense Ministry told reporters
Thursday that the search was initially hampered when Malaysian
officials delayed granting approval for a Singapore search
helicopter to fly through Malaysian air space to the accident site.
	   ``In a search and rescue operation every minute is vital. It can
mean the difference between life and death,'' said Col. Kevin Meta.
	   Singapore and Malaysia are in a spat over a number of
long-standing disputes. Malaysia last week forbade Singapore
military jets from flying into Malaysian air space without special
permission, breaking off several long-time bilateral arrangements.

	   TOWNSVILLE, Australia (AP) _ U.S. Open champion Patrick Rafter
overcame early resistance but teammate Jason Stoltenberg was rarely
troubled as Australia moved into a 2-0 lead over Uzbekistan in a
Davis Cup World Group qualifying tennis tie Friday.
	   Rafter beat 254th-ranked Oleg Ogorodov 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 in front of
a capacity crowd of 4,900 at the Townsville Entertainment Center.
Stoltenberg then beat 239th-ranked Vadim Kutsenko 7-5, 6-1, 6-0 in
the second singles match.
	   The experienced doubles pair of Todd Woodbridge and Mark
Woodforde can wrap up the tie on Saturday night with a win over
Ogorodov and Dmitri Tomashevich. The reverse singles matches will
be played Sunday.
	   Rafter, playing his first match since claiming his second
successive U.S. title, was tested in the opening set by the strong
backhand of Ogorodov.
	   A rusty Rafter made some uncharacteristic volleying errors as he

opponent again to take a 3-2 lead.
	   Rafter survived two break points in a marathon eighth game to
hold serve, before closing out the set in 43 minutes with a string
of powerful ground strokes which forced an error-strewn Ogorodov to
drop his serve again.
	   With the first set under his belt, Rafter seemed to have blown
away any cobwebs from his two-week break and he strolled through
the second, breaking Ogorodov in the eighth game to win 6-3 in 30
minutes.
	   The third set was a similar scenario, with Rafter taking a
single break off Ogorodov in the seventh game to take it 6-4.

Taiwan's EVA threatens to sue magazine over crash report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's EVA Air on Friday hinted it may
sue a gossip magazine that predicted one of its planes would crash
on a flight from Kuala Lumpur.
	   The racy First Hand weekly quoted a fortune teller in an August
issue saying that EVA flight BR37 would crash on Sept. 23. The
report had no apparent impact on ticket sales for the flight, and
the plane landed safely Wednesday night, the airline said.
	   EVA dispatched the head of flight operations and chief steward
to join the flight to boost crew morale, but said it didn't take
any other special measures in response to the report.
	   EVA will consider taking legal action against the magazine if it
publishes further articles on the subject, the airline said.
	   ``We don't want more rumors, but to be honest, we don't want to
give them the benefit of the publicity that a lawsuit would lend
them,'' said an airline representative, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   EVA has never had a serious accident in its nine years of
operations.
	   Telephone calls to the weekly went unanswered. First Hand,
stuffed with glossy pictures of scantily clad models and often
baseless gossip that frequently lands the publication in court, is
one of several such magazines in Taiwan

CIA, FBI help foil plot to bomb U.S. Embassy in Uganda
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS with report of CIA helping thwart attack &QL; 
 &UR; By HENRY WASSWA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Ugandan authorities are holding 20 people
in connection with a plot to blow up the U.S. Embassy in Kampala,
and the FBI was invited into the East African nation to help with
the investigation, a government minister says.
	   Regional cooperation minister Amama Mbabazi told a parliamentary
session Thursday that the FBI agents were invited to Uganda
following the Aug. 7 bombings of the U.S. diplomatic missions in
neighboring Kenya and Tanzania in which 259 people, including 12
Americans, died.
	   ``It is true that the Ugandan government through security
services asked for and obtained services of the FBI for expertise
on bomb attacks which are beyond our capacity to handle,'' Mbabazi
said.
	   He said Ugandan intelligence officials had learned that the
group that carried out the bombings in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam
also planned to attack the U.S. Embassy in Uganda.
	   American intelligence officers also helped thwart the plot, The
Washington Post reported in Friday's editions. Ugandan authorities
were aided by information from the CIA.
	   Among those detained are the two alleged ringleaders, arrested
last week as they tried to enter the country from Kenya. The two
men are believed to be associates of Islamic extremist Osama bin
Laden, the suspected mastermind in the bombings of U.S. embassies
last month, the Post said.
	   Over the weekend, security officials said 18 people had been
arrested in connection with plans to hit American and Ugandan
targets in the country. It was not clear when the other two people
were detained.
	   More than a dozen FBI agents worked with the Ugandan
Anti-Terrorism Squad to uncover the recent plot, seizing documents
from the homes and businesses of the suspects.
	   The CIA warned border authorities to be on the lookout for the
two ringleaders, who they said planned to direct the operation
using local militants. Law enforcement sources told the Post that
U.S. prosecutors are considering charges against them.
	   The other suspects _ which include the imam of a Kampala mosque,
a 15-year-old boy and local businessman _ have no apparent links to
bin Laden, sources told the Post.
	   Mbabazi said the FBI did not take part in the detentions.

Howard stands by criticism of Malaysia's prime minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard said
Friday he would not retract anything he said about the arrest of
former Malaysian deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	   The prime minister was repeating statements he made this week
about his stand on the situation in which Anwar had been arrested
and accused of sexual misconduct and treason.
	   On Monday. Howard said: ``It is a matter of deep concern to me,
and I think to most Australians, that there does appear to have
been a drift towards a more authoritarian approach.
	   ``The image of somebody who is clearly a political opponent of
the current prime minister being arrested is very disturbing.''
	   Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad then said Howard was
``wrong, absolutely'' and should ``check the real facts'' before
making accusations, and this was followed by a formal protest to
Australia's high commissioner.
	   ``My reply to him ... is to say to him that I don't retract what
I've said,'' Howard told a Melbourne radio station Friday.
	   ``I don't retreat in any way, nor do I retract one syllable of
what I've already said.''
	   Howard said he was aware of Australian interests in Malaysia.
	   ``I have made the very measured and moderate statement that I
want problems solved not through the use of the police or the
apparatus of the state but rather through the ballot box,'' he
said.

Indonesia to open skies for foreign airlines to attract tourism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hoping to boost Indonesia's sagging
tourism industry, President B.J. Habibie has reportedly decided to
further open up his country's skies to foreign airlines.
	   ``I, as a president, have decided to allow every foreign airline
to carry passengers from its home base and fly to any destination
(in Indonesia),'' Habibie was quoted by local newspapers as saying.
	   He made the comments in a speech to tourism operators on
Thursday, but did not elaborate.
	   The tourism industry has suffered in the wake of riots and
protests last May, which forced Habibie's autocratic predecessor
ex-President Suharto to relinquish power after 32 years in office.
	   Tourism numbers have continued to suffer in some areas due to
protests and outbreaks of sporadic violence, much of it generated
by the worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   Indonesia's airlines are facing massive problems because of the
crisis. Passenger numbers have dwindled and the carriers have been
squeezed by a dramatic drop in the value of the rupiah, Indonesia's
currency.
	   Most of the airlines' revenue is in rupiah, while the majority
of costs and debts are denominated in dollars.
	   The crisis has forced state-owned Garuda Indonesia to cut back
on flights.
	   Earlier this year, Sempati, the third largest airline and owned
by one of Suharto's sons, was forced to shut down.

Politician ordered to stand trial for murder of rival
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A court on Friday ordered a prominent
member of Sydney's Vietnamese community to stand trial for the
murder of a state politician who campaigned against Asian immigrant
crime gangs.
	   Magistrate Michael Price found there was ``an abundance of
evidence'' against Phuong Ngo, 39, who with two other men is
charged with the murder of New South Wales state politician John
Newman.
	   Newman was gunned down outside his home on Sept. 5, 1994.
	   Price said Ngo, a local government councilor in the same area
Newman represented in state parliament, should also face trial on a
charge of conspiring to murder Newman.
	   Ngo has not entered a plea and is in jail awaiting trial.
	   A date for the trial, which will be held in the New South Wales
Supreme Court, has not been set.
	   ``There is an abundance of evidence satisfying this court that,
so far as the defendant Ngo is concerned, there are reasonable
prospects of a jury, properly instructed, convicting him of the
substantive charge of murder, and I propose committing him to stand
trial on that substantive charge,'' Price said.
	   Pretrial proceedings against Ngo's two co-accused, Tuan Van
Tran, 29, and Tu Quang Dao, 35, will continue before Price on Nov.
30.
	   Newman's slaying in Cabramatta, a immigrant-dominated suburb of
Sydney, shocked Australia and later added fuel to calls by some to
curb Asian immigration.
	   In the months before his death, Newman regularly complained of
threats from gang leaders.

Explosions hit refinery in Australia

 &UR; Eds: Updates with gas tank being drenched with spray, windows
rattled in nearby town. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ A series of explosions ripped
through parts of Esso's gas plant near the town of Sale in
southeast Victoria state on Friday. Officials said seven people
were injured, one critically.
	   The ambulance service said the critically hurt person had
extensive facial and body burns and was being airlifted to
Melbourne.
	   The other six all suffered burns, but the ambulance spokesman
said none were life-threatening.
	   Three huge fires are out of control at the plant in Sale, about
110 miles (180 km) east of Melbourne, and a large storage tank
containing gas is being drenched by spray, Country Fire Authority
spokesman Peter Philp said.
	   He said the tank was extremely dangerous and was being sprayed
so it did not get too hot. Philp said the rampaging fires were
burning oil and gas.
	   All firefighters and Esso personnel had been withdrawn from the
plant while an emergency strategy was devised.
	   Philp said more than 60 firefighters and 12 fire trucks were on
standby.
	   A police spokesman said the cause of the explosions, which went
off before 1 p.m., was not known.
	   Windows shook in houses in the nearby town of Longford when the
explosions ripped through the Esso gas plant.
	   Esso spokesman Ron Webb said, ``A team has been deployed _ both
internally and externally _ to control the situation.''
	   He said all non-essential personnel had been evacuated from the
site and everyone was accounted for.
	   ``We have shut (down) gas and crude oil production as a
precautionary measure,'' Webb said.
	   ``As soon as the emergency is controlled we'll recommence
operations,'' he said.
	   In June, a plug of ice blocked the main supply line into the
plant, which is Victoria's major source of natural gas.
	   State-wide restrictions were imposed at the time, forcing
factory closures in 100 industry sectors at an estimated cost of 50
million Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 29 million).

South Africa's military intervention in Lesotho continues

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ After three days of looting and gunfire,
the capital appeared calm Friday but pillaging has reportedly
spread to other areas of this Belgium-sized monarchy.
	   Criticism of South Africa's military intervention in Lesotho was
widespread as the small kingdom tried to cope with the wholesale
destruction of its capital.
	   There were manned roadblocks on some streets of the capital,
Maseru, though bullets had stopped flying and South African and
Botswanan troops regained a semblance of control.
	   Embattled Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili spoke of
reconciliation on state radio and alleged the intervention that
began Tuesday came after he and other top officials were targeted
for assassination. Lesotho had requested South African help.
	   Mosisili did not name the alleged conspirators in the
assassination plot.
	   His opponents dismissed the claim as ``trash.''
	   No gunfire was audible early Friday in Maseru. There have been
reports of looting in other areas of Lesotho, the South African
Broadcasting Corp. reported Friday. No details were available.
	   Damage estimates from a looting and arson spree in Maseru that
began in the first hours of the intervention run into the millions
of dollars, and it's unclear where the money will come from to
rebuild.

Leakey named head of the Kenya Wildlife Service
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Richard Leakey, world's renowned
paleoanthrpologist and opposition legistor, has been named to head
the Kenya Wildlife Service for a second time after being forced to
quit four years ago by President Daniel Arap Moi, news reports said
Friday.
	   Kenya's three main newspapers said the aannouncement of his
appoitment was made to them by telephone late Thursday by the head
of the Presidential Prss Service, Lee Njiru.
	   Leakey's appointment had been rumored followng the dismissal
last week of KWS Director David Western.
	   A third-gneration Kenyan of British origin, Leakey was pushed
out by Moi in 1994 as head of the organization responsible for the
welfare of Kenyan wildlife _ the country's tourism asset _ in a
dispute over political control of the resource.
	   Since then, Moi has made no secret of his dislike of Leakey and
made every effort to block the registration of the opposition
Safina party which Leakey was instrumental in founding after
Kenya's return to multiparty politics in 1992.
	   Under a system that allows parties to nominate legislators based
on the number of seats they have won in a general election, Leakey
named to parliament for Safina after last December's elections.
	   When it appeared possible that Leakey might oppose Moi in a
presidential election, the veteran politician who assumed office in
1978 declared no white man should ever be president of Kenay.
	   Leakey's appointment to head the KWS is widely believed to
underline the prlous state of the body which has lost major
international major funding and is reported to be losing the battle
with private interests that want to expoloit the game reserves for
their own purposes.
	   During his previous term at KWS and as head of the National
Museums of Kenya _ founded by his father Louis B. Leakey _ Richard
Leaekey demonstrated great skills as an international fundraiser.

New plans to strengthen fight against fish resource piracy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAY LILLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) - New plans to tackle pirate
fishing vessels illegally poaching tens of thousands of tons of
Antarctic toothfish are to be put to a marine resource meeting in
Australia next month, the Foreign Ministry said Friday.
	   Associate Foreign Minister Simon Upton provided no details, but
officials told The Associated Press any response was likely to stop
short of naval interception as Antarctica's Ross Sea area is part
of the Antarctic demilitarized region.
	   Both France and Australia have used gunboats to arrest as many
as 10 illegal fishing vessels in their southern ocean territorial
waters in the past two years.
	   With the pirate fleet depleting stocks in some waters,
``unregulated toothfish fishing in the Ross Sea this summer is a
possibility New Zealand is taking seriously,'' Upton said. Pressure
would rise as poachers fished out other toothfish grounds.
	   New Zealand claims guardianship of the 370,000 square miles
(958,000 sq. km.) of the Ross Sea Dependency, a fresh target for
the estimated 80 pirate boats in the fleet fishing for the prized
Antarctic toothfish.
	   ``The pressure on toothfish stocks in parts of the Southern
Ocean doesn't appear to be diminishing. The Ross Sea could provide
a tempting target for the poachers as they fish out grounds
elsewhere,'' Upton said.
	   He said the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine
Living Resources (CCAMLR) reports 130,000 metric tons of toothfish
worth up to 600 million New Zealand dollars (U.S. dlrs 300 million)
has been caught illegally by the pirate fleet in the past two
years.
	   The 24 member nations of CCAMLR are working to strengthen its
ability ``to deal with illegal and unregulated fishing throughout
the Southern Ocean,'' Upton told AP.
	   ``The credibility of CCAMLR is on the line,'' he said. ``We are
disappointed at the growing evidence that companies and nationals
associated with countries which are parties to CCAMLR are behind
much of the toothfish plunder.''
	   Pirate vessels from CCAMLR countries, flying flags of
convenience to disguise their country of origin, have been
identified as part of the toothfish fleet.
	   Some reports suggest the area around South Africa's Marion and
Prince Edward Islands already has been fished out.
	   This has forced the trawlers to head east to the French islands
of Glen Crozet and Kerguelen, just north of the Southern Ocean, and
on to Australia's Heard and McDonald Islands.
	   The pirate fleet, which uses sophisticated tracking, catching
and even sea catch transfer systems to disguise fish origins, began
pursing the toothfish in 1996 in South Atlantic waters off
Argentina and South Georgia Island, until British patrol vessels
chased them away.
	   The fishing fleet then moved east toward Namibia and South
Africa, until South African authorities applied pressure.
	   France's sub-Antarctic islands of Crozet and Kerguelen were
next, until French marines operating from patrol boats seized three

Australian waters.

Most Asian markets open lower on Wall Street's decline
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Tracking Wall Street's overnight plunge, most
Asian stock markets opened sharply lower Friday, erasing most of
the strong gains made in recent sessions.
	   In Japan, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average led the
way, falling 456.28 points, or 3.2 percent, to close the morning at
13,749.50 points. The Nikkei had gained 3.02 percent Thursday.
	   Other regional bourses, which rallied sharply Thursday on
expectations that the U.S. Federal Reverse would cut interest
rates, also moved lower following Wall Street's 1.9-percent
Thursday decline.
	   Profit taking also exacerbated Friday's falls, shaving 3 percent
off the main stock index in Indonesia, 1.7 percent in Singapore,
1.4 percent in Thailand and 0.9 percent in Malaysia.
	   In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index, after surging 9.2
percent the previous three days, closed the morning 2.2 percent
lower at 7,665.10.
	   Traders said the fall was partly sparked by news that the U.S.
Federal Reserve Bank of New York had to help organize a U.S. dlrs
3.5 billion bailout for Long-Term Capital Management, a hedge fund.
	   Traders said players are worried that there may be more U.S.
funds with problems and that instability in the U.S. financial
system could reverberate around the world.
	   ``Those are good enough factors for the market to go down,''
said Kent Rossiter, senior institutional sales manager with Nikko
Securities Co. (Asia) Ltd in Hong Kong.
	   Meanwhile, market participants across Asia also were wary of
continued bickering between Japan's ruling party and the opposition
over a key package of bills to reform Japan's ailing financial
system.
	   The main sticking point is the use of public funds to rescue
cash-strapped Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, one the nation's
biggest banks.
	   An agreement on those reforms would help stabilize the Japanese
currency and give investors some much-needed confidence in the
region, analysts say.
	   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar slumped against the
Japanese yen, partly on position adjustments by market players who
needed to buy the Japanese currency, dealers said.
	   The dollar cost 135.03 yen as of late Friday morning, down 1.77
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also slightly below its late
New York level of 135.10 yen overnight.

Profit-taking slows Asian markets, but so does the U.S. bailout
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By THOMAS WAGNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ As they have many times before, Asian stock markets
followed the lead of Wall Street on Friday, and used profit-taking
to whittle away at big gains from the day before.
	   But a new development in the United States _ the near-collapse
of a major hedge-fund business _ also unnerved some investors.
	   On Wednesday, Asia's battered bourses had seen big improvements,
thanks to a strong hint by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
that U.S. interest rates will be cut.
	   The key market indexes had jumped 3 percent in Tokyo, 4.4
percent in Hong Kong, and 3.4 percent in Singapore. Smaller markets
had done even better, with indexes surging 8.2 percent in Bangkok,
6.6 percent in Seoul and 7.6 percent in Indonesia.
	   But Thursday was just the opposite, by and large, thanks mainly
to traders selling shares to cash in on the sharp gains.
	   In Japan, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell
456.28 points, or 3.2 percent, to close the morning session at
13,749.50 points. That more than erased Thursday's gains.
	   Analysts said Tokyo was reacting to the Dow Jones industrial
average, which closed 1.9 percent lower Thursday, thanks to
profit-taking following Wednesday's big 3.3 percent jump.
	   But in a region of shell-shocked markets that are always looking
for any sign that Asia's crisis is going global, traders also
seemed concerned about the United States.
	   On Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of New York
orchestrated a dlrs 3.5 billion bailout of Long-Term Capital
Management LP, a hedge-fund business, by a consortium of banks and
brokerage firms.
	   The New York Fed acted because it was concerned that the failure
of Long-Term Capital would jeopardize the nation's financial
system. The fund had more than dlrs 90 billion invested in complex
bets in financial markets around the world.
	   On Friday, shares of Japanese banks led the way, down 3.2
percent at midday because of concerns about the health of the
entire U.S. financial system following the bailout, traders said.
	   The rescue of Long-Term by the consortium has generated fears
that more losses are possible at other financial institutions in
the United States, the traders said.
	   ``With concerns about the overall financial system mounting,
players have refrained from buying Japanese stocks actively,'' said
Yasuo Ueki, a general manager at Nikko Securities in Tokyo.
	   Traders said market players also are wary of continued bickering
between Japan's ruling party and the opposition over a key package
of bills to reform Japan's ailing financial system.
	   In Hong Kong, the blue chip Hang Seng Index was down 169.51
points, or 2.2 percent, to 7665.10 at midday Friday.
	   There, traders also blamed the Dow Jones fall and fears that the
Long-Term Capital Management bailout indicates that other U.S.
institutions may be sitting on bad news.
	   ``I think the U.S. market is a concern obviously. It highlights
the risk in the hedge fund market,'' said Alice Leung, a senior
investment analyst with Worldsec International Ltd.
	   Singapore stocks also fell, with investors taking profits after
Thursday's robust gains. The bellwether Straits Times Index fell
16.1 points, or 1.7 percent, to 915.88 at midday Friday.

Australian election candidates agree on something _ football
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROHAN SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ With just one week to go, the low-key
campaign for Australia's national election is about to be
overshadowed by contests of more pressing importance to many people
_ football grand finals.
	   Prime Minister John Howard has already said he believes
Australians are smart enough to watch sport and follow the campaign
at the same time. Nevertheless, a political truce of sorts has been
declared for the weekend, when the grand finals for Australia's two
most popular football varieties will be fought out.
	   Howard and Labor Party opposition leader Kim Beazley have even
picked the same sides to win in both matches.
	   Sport is serious business in Australia, and conventional wisdom
has held for decades that any government that calls an election on
the weekend of a grand finals is committing political suicide.
Howard said as much when considering when to call the poll.
	   Australians do not like their sports cheerleading interrupted by
a compulsory trip to the election booths.
	   During campaigning for the Oct. 3 election, both leaders have
gone out of their way to be associated with sports heroes, racing
to congratulate U.S. Open tennis finalists Pat Rafter and Mark
Philoppoussis and to be photographed with Australia's gold
medal-draped Commonwealth Games team.
	   On Saturday, a live crowd of 100,000 and many more television
viewers are expected to watch the Adelaide Crows defend their title
against challengers North Melbourne in the Australian Football
League grand final in Melbourne.
	   Also known as Australian rules football, the game is distinct
from all other types of football and is played only in Australia.
	   Howard joked this week that he had taken his life in his hands
by backing the defending side.
	   ``The head of my security detail team is a fanatical North
Melbourne supporter and he has threatened all sort of consequences
if I openly support Adelaide, which I am doing,'' said Howard, a
bookish former lawyer and avid follower of the ``gentleman's game''
of cricket.
	   ``I am in big trouble, he says no bodies in front of the
bullets.''
	   On Sunday, similar crowds are expected to watch the Brisbane
Broncos play the Sydney-based Canterbury Bulldogs in the National
Rugby League grand final in Sydney.
	   Beazley, an overweight enthusiast of military strategy, joined
Howard in tipping favorites Brisbane.
	   Party officers confirmed Friday that both leaders would be
attending both matches.
	   A TV commercial promoting Australian Rugby League football even
included both Howard and Beazley among scenes of supporters. The ad
hedged its bets by letting each man appear in a rugby shirt
emblazoned with ``No. 1.''
	   Interest in the finals is in contrast to that in the campaign.
	   Social researcher Hugh Mackay said in a newspaper column this
week the campaign was ``weirdly subdued,'' despite polls showing a
tight race, with Labor just in front.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Pro-democracy activists secretly
distributed leaflets and shouted slogans in Kuala Lumpur's main
mosque during Friday prayers as riot police stood by to prevent the
gathering from turning into a political rally.
	   Police blocked off a few roads leading to the National Mosque
and monitored the other routes, but did not check or prevent anyone
from reaching it.
	   The government Thursday warned Malaysians against using Friday
prayers to demonstrate solidarity for arrested pro-reform leader
Anwar Ibrahim.
	   But some people at the mosque shouted ``reforms, reforms'' after
the prayers were over. Activists also handed out green-colored
sheets of paper containing information about a proposed rally in
support of Anwar on Saturday.
	   In an apparent bid to head off potential trouble, the
government's Department of Islamic Advancement announced in a
statement that there would be no special prayers at Kuala Lumpur's
National Mosque.
	   The mosque was the site of a huge rally led by ousted former
deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim on Sunday. Demanding the
resignation of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and shouting for
reforms, tens of thousands of people marched to the Independence
Square from the mosque.
	   Anwar was arrested the same night under security provisions that
allow up to two years imprisonment without trial. Neither his
family nor his lawyers have seen him since and despite government
assurances there would be a fair trial, he has not appeared in
court.
	   Meanwhile, Malaysia came under fresh international criticism for
curbing political rallies and threatening to arrest critics of
Mahathir under the Internal Security Act.
	   ``We are increasingly concerned by the use of the Internal
Security Act to restrict the rights of assembly, free speech, and
open communication in Malaysia,'' a U.S. State Department statement
said.
	   Australian Prime Minister John Howard said he would not retract
anything he had said about Anwar's arrest.
	   Asked to comment on Mahathir's denial of his statement that
Malaysia was drifting toward authoritarianism, Howard said: ``I
don't retreat in any way, nor do I retract one syllable of what
I've already said.''
	   On Friday, Kuala Lumpur was rife with rumors that the weekly
mass prayer at the Masjid Negara, or National Mosque, would be used
by Anwar's supporters to make statements.
	   ``Those intending to hold activities at Masjid Negara must get
permission from the chief imam of the mosque'' or a government
department, said an official statement on Thursday.
	   Malaysia's national police chief threatened Thursday to ``come
down hard'' on anyone who tries to follow Anwar's lead and organize
anti-government rallies.
	   Anwar's last rally was part of a series he held across the
Southeast Asian nation after being dumped as deputy prime minister
and finance minister on Sept. 2 by Mahathir, who called him morally
unfit to lead.
	   Police have threatened Anwar's wife with arrest if she addresses
the public. Officers have blockaded two streets around her home to
keep journalists and supporters away.
	   Anwar has adamantly denied a string of police accusations
against him, including unlawful sex acts, disturbing public order,
interfering with police investigations, and leaking state secrets.
	   The trouble started when he began questioning Mahathir's
17-year-rule and financial policies and began portraying himself as
an alternative to the prime minister, Anwar said during two weeks
of nationwide rallies before he was arrested.
	   Meanwhile, the ruling United Malays National Organization party
threatened pro-Anwar members with expulsion. Six top UMNO leaders,
including the chief of the party's powerful youth wing, are among
the 16 people who have been jailed under the Internal Security Act
since the protests started this month.
	   However, of the 132 people arrested during the protests, only 23
were still in police custody, a police spokesman said.

Top seeds Sanchez-Vicario, Seles advance to semifinals

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Top seed Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario picked apart Anna
Kournikova's attacking game in gusty winds Friday, advancing to the
semifinals of the Toyota Princess Cup.
	   Sanchez-Vicario won 6-3, 6-2, her second victory in a month over
the 17-year-old Russian after losses in their first three meetings.
	   Second seed Monica Seles, seeking her third consecutive Toyota
title, advanced by overpowering France's Julie Halard-Decugis 6-2,
6-1. She yielded only four points in the first five games of the
second set.
	   Seles next meets Thailand's Tamarine Tanasugarn, who ended
American Amy Frazier's hot streak with a 6-1, 6-3 victory. Frazier
had beaten rising 16-year-old Croatian Mirjana Lucic and No. 3 seed
Amanda Coetzer of South Africa in the first two rounds. Tamarine
eliminated eighth seed Henrieta Nagyova of Slovakia in the second
round.
	   The winds presented new problems after three days of playing
mostly with the roof closed on the Ariake Colosseum because of
rain.
	   Sanchez-Vicario and Tamarine generally played conservatively,
letting their opponents make the mistakes, while Seles came out
blasting as usual.
	   ``I went for my shots, but I went at the right time,'' said
Seles. ``I'm happy with the total outlook.''
	   Playing with the roof open or closed ``is like two different
tournaments,'' she added. ``It's very difficult going back and
forth this much in a week.''
	   Sanchez-Vicario also said the key was to ``attack at the right
time and the right moment.''
	   The Spaniard, ranked fourth by the WTA, mixed up her spins and
pace, and said she had learned lessons from her first three losses
to Kournikova.
	   ``I think my shots were very effective. I moved her around very
well and I was much more consistent than she was. ... I played
better mentally with the wind than she did,'' Sanchez-Vicario said.
	   Kournikova, whose Japan debut has been greeted eagerly because
of her glamour, said, ``It was difficult for me to catch her
rhythm. Everything was going wrong today.''
	   Tamarine, who reached the last 16 at Wimbledon this year before
losing to No. 1 Martina Hingis, had lost her only previous meeting
with Frazier, in August.
	   In the wind, she said, ``I was playing pretty safe. I tried not
to hit a lot of unforced errors.''
	   Sanchez-Vicario next plays the winner of a match later Friday
between No. 7 seed Anke Huber of Germany and 18-year-old Olga
Barabanschikova of Belarus.

	   YAUCO, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Miguel Morales bent his tall frame
under a wagon half-hidden by a dying palm tree and pulled out a
frantically bleating three-week-old lamb.
	   ``I lost 25 little ones like this,'' he said after tucking the
brown-and-white foundling under his arm and offering it words of
reassurance. The 110-mph (180 kph) winds of Hurricane Georges
simply ``picked them up and slammed them'' into metal trailers near
his farmhouse, killing them on the spot, he said.
	   Tales like his emerged all over Puerto Rico in the aftermath of
the deadly storm, which dealt farmers _ and their livestock and
crops _ a crippling blow when it struck Monday.
	   Agriculture secretary Miguel A. Munoz estimated that half the
island's critical banana, plantain and coffee crops were destroyed,
with damages in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
	   The thrashing of the plantain fields _ which will not be dry
enough to be replanted for months _ is a special blow to national
pride since it is a crop dear to the island's heart.
	   New coffee plants _ another national favorite _ would not yield
beans for three years.
	   In Yauco's mountainous coffee country, a frustrated Joel Negron
fingered a handful of green coffee beans on Thursday, crushing one
to show the white, bitter-tasting kernel inside. ``Two more weeks
and these would have been red and ready to pick,'' he said.
	   Nearby, coffee planter Manuel Torres also lamented his loss.
	   Fall normally would be a bright time for Torres' family of six.
His eight acres (three hectares) produce 8,000 pounds (3,600 kilos)
of coffee, yielding dlrs 8,000 revenue. Now it looks like Torres is
headed for welfare.
	   ``The wind has knocked them around and broken all the roots,''
he said, surveying devastated coffee plants. ``They'll dry out and
pretty soon this whole hill will be brown.''
	   Other farmers lost their homes and barns in flash floods.
	   Stroking the lamb, Morales predicted the price of produce will
soon rise as Puerto Rico is forced to import from the U.S.
mainland.
	   ``You just wait,'' he said, staring at the banana and plantain
trees toppled over an 85-acre (34-hectare) expanse. A nearby
graveyard of planting stakes marked a ruined tomato field.
	   He said he would dig into his savings to buy more seed while
waiting for the insurance inspector to arrive.
	   ``I'll replant,'' he said. ``We all will. I take blow after blow
after blow. But you can't give farming up. It's in the blood.''

 &UR; Washington slams Malaysia for repression

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The United States on Friday
slammed Malaysia for using a draconian security provision against
political opponents of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   ``We are increasingly concerned by the use of the Internal
Security Act to restrict the rights of assembly, free speech, and
open communication in Malaysia,'' a State Department statement
said.
	   The statement is the first detailed reaction by Washington since
Sunday's arrest of former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim from
his house by riot police. Anwar has not been seen since then and
police have not produced him in court.
	   The government says that Anwar, who became Mahathir's fiercest
critic since he was fired on Sept. 2, had to be detained under the
ISA because of the huge rallies he had organized challenging
Mahathir's 17-year-rule.
	   Anwar also faces several police accusations, including unlawful
sex acts, disturbing public order, interfering with police
investigations, and leaking state secrets. He has denied the
charges.
	   Police have threatened Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, with arrest
if she tries to take up the leadership of the pro-reform campaign
and addresses the public. Officers have blockaded two streets
around her home to keep journalists and supporters away.
	   ``In particular we are concerned by the continued detention of
former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and a number of his
associates under the ISA, and, more recently by restrictions placed
on the activities of Anwar's wife,'' the U.S. statement said.
	   At least 16 of Anwar's associates have been detained by the
police under the ISA, an act dating back to British colonial times
that allows for up to two years imprisonment without trial.
	   ``We believe that all Malaysians should be allowed to defend
themselves in open court in expeditious fashion under the legal
protections afforded by Malaysian law and the Malaysian
constitution,'' the statement said.

Explosions hit refinery in Australia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with gas tank being drenched with spray, windows
rattled in nearby town, eighth person injured.

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ A series of explosions ripped
through parts of Esso's gas plant near the town of Sale in
southeast Victoria state on Friday. Officials said eight people
were injured, one critically.
	   The ambulance service said the critically hurt person had
extensive facial and body burns and was being airlifted to
Melbourne.
	   The other seven all suffered burns, but the ambulance spokesman
said none were life-threatening.
	   Three huge fires wee out of control at the plant in Sale, about
110 miles (180 km) east of Melbourne, and a large storage tank
containing gas was being drenched by spray, Country Fire Authority
spokesman Peter Philp said.
	   He said the tank was extremely dangerous and was being sprayed
so it did not get too hot. Philp said the rampaging fires were
burning oil and gas.
	   A Channel Seven TV reporter nearing the scene in a helicopter
said, ``As we approached the scene from about 30 kilometers (18
miles) away we could see a large plume of thick black smoke
probably rising about 15 kilometers (9 miles) into the air.
	   ``We could also see flashes like very large mushrooms of fire
coming out of the gas plant,'' he said.
	   All firefighters and Esso personnel had been withdrawn from the
plant while an emergency strategy was devised.
	   Philp said more than 60 firefighters and 12 fire trucks were on
standby.
	   A police spokesman said the cause of the explosions, which went
off before 1 p.m., was not known.
	   Windows shook in houses in the nearby town of Longford when the
explosions ripped through the Esso gas plant.
	   Esso spokesman Ron Webb said, ``A team has been deployed _ both
internally and externally _ to control the situation.''
	   He said all non-essential personnel had been evacuated from the
site and everyone was accounted for.
	   ``We have shut (down) gas and crude oil production as a
precautionary measure,'' Webb said.
	   ``As soon as the emergency is controlled we'll recommence
operations,'' he said.
	   In June, a plug of ice blocked the main supply line into the
plant, which is Victoria's major source of natural gas.
	   State-wide restrictions were imposed at the time, forcing
factory closures in 100 industry sectors at an estimated cost of 50
million Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 29 million).

Tokyo stock prices fall sharply, U.S. dollar lower
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing Nikkei, mid-afternoon dollar and bond;
some editing to conform &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo share prices dropped sharply Friday, taking
their cue from the overnight plunge on Wall Street. The U.S. dollar
also tumbled against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 481.94 points,
or 3.4 percent, to close at 13,723.84 points. The fall more than
reversed the gains the Nikkei made on Thursday, when it added
415.97 points, or 3.02 percent.
	   The dollar cost 135.38 yen in midafternoon trading, down 1.42
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo but slightly above its late New
York level of 135.10 yen overnight.
	   Overnight in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average closed
at 8,001.99 Thursday, down 152.42 points.
	   Traders said market players were also wary of continued
bickering between Japan's ruling party and the opposition over a
key package of bills to reform Japan's ailing financial system.
	   The main sticking point is the use of public funds to rescue
cash-strapped Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, one of the nation's
biggest banks.
	   The opposition has rejected the latest compromise proposal from
the ruling Liberal Democrats to use a pool of 17 trillion yen (dlrs
126 billion) in public funds.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all shares listed on the
first section fell 28.08 points, or 2.6 percent, to 1,049.93. The
TOPIX added 27.84 points, or 2.65 percent, the day before.
	   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar fell partly on
adjustments by market players who needed to buy the Japanese
currency, dealers said.
	   Worries that U.S. financial institutions may have been hit
harder than expected by the fallout of emerging market turmoil also
helped send the dollar lower, they said.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond stood at 0.810 percent, down from Thursday's finish
of 0.880. Its price rose to 108.92 yen from 108.24 yen the previous
day.

Report: Suharto's cousin strikes deal on bank debt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian banking authorities have
reached a deal with former President Suharto's cousin for him to
repay 1.9 trillion rupiah (dlrs 172 million) his PT Bank Surya owes
the government, an official involved in the negotiations said.
	   Sudwikatmono, the cousin, will make most of the repayment of the
emergency and lending funds in cash, with the rest in assets, the
official told Dow Jones Newswires.
	   Sudwikatmono's bank, as has been the case with a number of other
major financial institutions, was found to have breached the
nation's legal lending limit.
	   The law caps the amount of funds banks may lend to related
parties at 20 percent of the bank's total equity.
	   A Sept. 21 deadline the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency set
for bankers to repay the funds has passed.
	   But a number of businessmen, such as Sudwikatmono, have been
holding last-minute negotiations to avoid potential criminal
proceedings against them. A government body will meet next week to
decide the fate of those bankers who fail to cut deals.
	   Another of Suharto's close associates, businessman Mohamad
``Bob'' Hasan, is also involved in last-minute talks.

Everything is on the line as Sosa heads to Houston
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NANCY ARMOUR &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) _ One weekend. Three games.
	   After 65 home run hops, countless chest thumps and kisses to his
mother, Sammy Sosa's spectacular season has come down to 72 hours.
It's winner take all, in both the home run chase and the NL
wild-card race, and Sosa is ready.
	   ``We need to go to Houston and remember only one thing: The last
three days we're going to find out if we're going to make it, yes
or no,'' he said.
	   Sosa broke out of his worst slump of the season Wednesday by
hitting two solo home runs to tie Mark McGwire at 65. McGwire
usually answers right back, but he was homerless Wednesday and
Thursday.
	   The St. Louis Cardinals have three games remaining, all at Busch
Stadium, where McGwire has hit 33 home runs. The Cubs play their
three games at the Houston Astros, who gave up three homers to Sosa
in a seven-day span last month. Jose Lima, who gave up two of the
home runs, is scheduled to pitch Friday.
	   Let McGwire swing for the fences, Sosa said. He's chasing
something even more important than the home run title.
	   ``When you're trying to go to the playoffs, you're never
thinking about home runs,'' he said.
	   The Cubs and New York Mets are tied for the lead in the NL
wild-card race, but San Francisco won again Thursday and is now
just a game back. The Mets are at Atlanta this weekend, while the
Giants visit Colorado.
	   Chicago had a chance to add to its lead Wednesday, but the Cubs
blew a 7-0 lead and Milwaukee scored three runs when Brant Brown
dropped what would have been the final out for an 8-7 victory.
	   ``Everybody that plays this game doesn't want to make a mistake,
but as a human being, as a person, nobody's perfect,'' Sosa said.
``(That game) is over for us, so we've got to go to Houston and try
to play much better.''
	   At least Sosa doesn't have to worry about his slump anymore.
After hitting a grand slam for No. 63 on Sept. 16, he went 0-for-21
and said he hadn't felt so bad at the plate all season.
	   Superstitious even when things are going well, Sosa tried
everything. On Tuesday night, he switched bats three times in hopes
of changing his karma. Nothing.
	   On Wednesday, he found a lucky bat. After walking twice, he hit
home runs in the fifth and sixth innings. That gave him 12 against
the Milwaukee Brewers, his most against any team.
	   ``The two home runs that I hit, it is a good sign. I feel
great,'' he said. ``I had great concentration at the home plate and
I was being really patient. When I'm like that, I have more
opportunity, more chances to make much better contact.''
	   Sosa has tended to go on home run binges this season, and he and
his teammates are hoping the two against Milwaukee were the start
of another frenzy.
	   ``We want to be playing in October, and Sammy's helping us to
get to that point,'' Cubs manager Jim Riggleman said. ``It's a
tremendous thing that he's doing.''
	   Sosa is well aware of how much is at stake this weekend. Hit a
few out, get some help from the rest of the Cubs and he could end
up on his way to the playoffs as the Home Run King.
	   Or he could go home with nothing. No playoffs. No title.
	   ``That's our last chances,'' Sosa said. ``We believe in
ourselves and no matter who's up there, we're trying to win. When
you have that in yourself and you believe in yourself, I don't
think anything can go wrong with you.''

Profit-taking slows Asian markets, but so does the U.S. bailout
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS to Thursday, sted Wednesday, in graf 3. &QL; 
 &UR; By THOMAS WAGNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ As they have many times before, Asian stock markets
followed the lead of Wall Street on Friday, and used profit-taking
to whittle away at big gains from the day before.
	   But a new development in the United States _ the near-collapse
of a major hedge-fund business _ also unnerved some investors.
	   On Thursday, Asia's battered bourses had seen big improvements,
thanks to a strong hint by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
that U.S. interest rates will be cut.
	   The key market indexes had jumped 3 percent in Tokyo, 4.4
percent in Hong Kong, and 3.4 percent in Singapore. Smaller markets
had done even better, with indexes surging 8.2 percent in Bangkok,
6.6 percent in Seoul and 7.6 percent in Indonesia.
	   But Friday was just the opposite, by and large, thanks mainly to
traders selling shares to cash in on the sharp gains.
	   In Japan, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell
456.28 points, or 3.2 percent, to close the morning session at
13,749.50 points. That more than erased Thursday's gains.
	   Analysts said Tokyo was reacting to the Dow Jones industrial
average, which closed 1.9 percent lower Thursday, thanks to
profit-taking following Wednesday's big 3.3 percent jump.
	   But in a region of shell-shocked markets that are always looking
for any sign that Asia's crisis is going global, traders also
seemed concerned about the United States.
	   Late Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of New York
orchestrated a dlrs 3.5 billion bailout of Long-Term Capital
Management LP, a hedge-fund business, by a consortium of banks and
brokerage firms.
	   The New York Fed acted because it was concerned that the failure
of Long-Term Capital would jeopardize the nation's financial
system. The fund had more than dlrs 90 billion invested in complex
bets in financial markets around the world.
	   On Friday, shares of Japanese banks led the way, down 3.2
percent at midday because of concerns about the health of the
entire U.S. financial system following the bailout, traders said.
	   The rescue of Long-Term by the consortium has generated fears
that more losses are possible at other financial institutions in
the United States, the traders said.
	   ``With concerns about the overall financial system mounting,
players have refrained from buying Japanese stocks actively,'' said
Yasuo Ueki, a general manager at Nikko Securities in Tokyo.
	   Traders said market players also are wary of continued bickering
between Japan's ruling party and the opposition over a key package
of bills to reform Japan's ailing financial system.
	   In Hong Kong, the blue chip Hang Seng Index was down 169.51
points, or 2.2 percent, to 7665.10 at midday Friday.
	   There, traders also blamed the Dow Jones fall and fears that the
Long-Term Capital Management bailout indicates that other U.S.
institutions may be sitting on bad news.
	   ``I think the U.S. market is a concern obviously. It highlights
the risk in the hedge fund market,'' said Alice Leung, a senior
investment analyst with Worldsec International Ltd.
	   Singapore stocks also fell, with investors taking profits after
Thursday's robust gains. The bellwether Straits Times Index fell
16.1 points, or 1.7 percent, to 915.88 at midday Friday.

Tokyo stock prices fall sharply, U.S. dollar lower
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CHANGES first percentage figure in graf 2 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo share prices dropped sharply Friday, taking
their cue from the overnight plunge on Wall Street. The U.S. dollar
also tumbled against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 481.94 points,
or 3.39 percent, to close at 13,723.84 points. The fall more than
reversed the gains the Nikkei made on Thursday, when it added
415.97 points, or 3.02 percent.
	   The dollar cost 135.38 yen in midafternoon trading, down 1.42
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo but slightly above its late New
York level of 135.10 yen overnight.
	   Overnight in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average closed
at 8,001.99 Thursday, down 152.42 points.
	   Traders said market players were also wary of continued
bickering between Japan's ruling party and the opposition over a
key package of bills to reform Japan's ailing financial system.
	   The main sticking point is the use of public funds to rescue
cash-strapped Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, one of the nation's
biggest banks.
	   The opposition has rejected the latest compromise proposal from
the ruling Liberal Democrats to use a pool of 17 trillion yen (dlrs
126 billion) in public funds.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all shares listed on the
first section fell 28.08 points, or 2.6 percent, to 1,049.93. The
TOPIX added 27.84 points, or 2.65 percent, the day before.
	   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar fell partly on
adjustments by market players who needed to buy the Japanese
currency, dealers said.
	   Worries that U.S. financial institutions may have been hit
harder than expected by the fallout of emerging market turmoil also
helped send the dollar lower, they said.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond stood at 0.810 percent, down from Thursday's finish
of 0.880. Its price rose to 108.92 yen from 108.24 yen the previous
day.

Researchers: Pill makes a bout of flu shorter and less miserable
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANIEL Q. HANEY &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Editor &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ An experimental new pill appears to reduce a
typical four-day bout of the flu by about a day and a half while
making you feel better, too.
	   It is one of two closely related drugs in development _ one
given as a pill, the other as a nasal spray _ that could offer
important new weapons against the ubiquitous wintertime misery.
	   Two other flu medicines are already on the market, but they are
ineffective against one of the two major varieties of the flu
virus. The two medicines in development appear to work against both
kinds.
	   If they eventually win approval from the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, they could serve as a kind of backup to the flu
vaccine, which will remain the most important defense against the
disease.
	   Researchers were to outline the results Friday of the first
large-scale human testing of a medicine code named GS4104, being
developed by Gilead Sciences Inc. and Hoffman-LaRoche.
	   The studies suggest that if taken within a day or so after
symptoms start, GS4104 reduces flu's severity by 40 percent and its
duration by 33 percent.
	   ``This will get people back on their feet more quickly,'' said
Dr. Frederick G. Hayden of the University of Virginia, one of the
researchers.
	   Hayden said the medicine's pill form makes it easy to take. He
said this could give it an edge over a chemically similar
competitor, called zanamivir, which is a nasal spray.
	   Since neither drug is on the market yet and they have not been
compared head to head, no one knows which will be more effective.
However, the two drugs attack the cold virus the same way; in the
test tube, they appear to be of similar potency.
	   The drugs already on the market are Symmetrel, known generically
as amantadine, and Flumadine, known generically as rimantadine.
	   Both are effective against influenza A, but they are useless
against influenza B.
	   In studies financed by the drug's developers, doctors tested
GS4104 on 629 patients in the United States. All were seen within 1
1/2 days of the start of symptoms and were randomly given the
medicine or dummy pills.
	   GS4104 appeared to reduce the duration of symptoms from an
average of 4.3 days to 2.9 days while also making people feel less
miserable.
	   Besides cutting short a bout of flu, the researchers also found
that a once-a-day dose could keep people from catching the illness
at all. In a separate study on about 1,600 volunteers, they showed
that only 1 percent of people taking the pills came down with the
flu, compared with nearly 5 percent in an untreated comparison
group.
	   The doctors emphasized that the pills would be not be a
substitute for a flu shot.
	   Instead, they might be useful for warding off the flu in those
who fail to get the shot and for those who fail to respond properly
to the shot. They also could be helpful in years when flu shots
aren't highly effective against whatever strain of flu is
circulating.
	   ``These data are relatively impressive,'' said Dr. William Craig
of the University of Wisconsin, who headed the meeting's program
committee.

Japan court rules public spending on imperial ceremony legal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ An appeals court in southwestern Japan ruled Friday
that local officials did not violate the constitution by using
public funds to attend a ceremony linked to the Japanese emperor's
enthronement.
	   Upholding a 1994 lower court ruling, presiding judge Keiichi
Konagamitsu of the Fukuoka High Court rejected an appeal from a
group of 38 residents of Oita prefecture, or state, a court
official said.
	   In 1991, the plaintiffs sued three Oita prefecture officials,
including Gov. Morihiko Hiramatsu, demanding they return about
28,500 yen (dlrs 212) they spent on attending the ceremony to
prefectural coffers.
	   The group claimed that the officials had violated the
constitutional separation of religion and state by using public
money to attend a religious ceremony.
	   In the ritual, Shinto priests harvested rice to be offered as a
sacred offering for the new Emperor Akihito, who ascended to the
ancient Chrysanthemum throne after his father, Hirohito, died in
1989.
	   In Friday's ruling, Konagamitsu told the court that the
attendance by the three officials was a ``form of social
ceremony,'' not a religious activity, said the court official who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Satoshi Kono, chief lawyer for the plaintiffs, told a news
conference later that the group will appeal again.
	   In a major case involving a controversial shrine to Japan's war
dead, the nation's top court last year ruled that government
donations to religious shrines violate Japan's Constitution.

Jospin attends delivery of French aid to Chinese flood survivors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Prime Minister Lionel Jospin was on hand Friday
for the delivery of two French-made water purification systems
donated by the conglomerate Vivendi to help survivors of
catastrophic flooding in China.
	   Jospin was joined by managing director Noel Forgeard of Airbus
Industrie, which donated the use of a cargo jet to deliver the
equipment.
	   Jospin then flew to Hefei, the capital of Anhui province in
eastern China, to meet President Jiang Zemin, who is inspecting
recovery from the catastrophic floods that killed more than 3,000
people.
	   The unusual location for a meeting of international leaders
prompted speculation that China was slighting Jospin for France's
sale of Mirage Jets to Taiwan in 1992, when Jospin was
secretary-general of the French Socialist Party, which was in power
at the time.
	   Chinese officials said no snub was intended. Jospin said Taiwan
was not mentioned in his talks Thursday on economic ties, the Asian
financial crisis and human rights with Premier Zhu Rongji.
	   Jospin was scheduled to leave Hefei later Friday for Shanghai,
China's financial and commercial center. He also plans to visit
Hong Kong.
	   The Airbus ``Beluga'' jet that brought the water purification
equipment is normally used to transport aircraft parts from Airbus
factories around Europe to final assembly lines in Toulouse,
France, and Hamburg, Germany.
	   Airbus has used it twice in the past for assistance to China,
one of the consortium's key customers, bringing flight simulators
to Beijing last year for an Airbus training center.
	   The value of the water equipment donated by Vivendi, the French
services and communications group, was not disclosed.
	   France-China ties have improved steadily in the past three years
following the strains over the weapons sales to Taiwan. Last year,
the French and Chinese presidents pledged to form a ``global
partnership.''
	   The two sides on Thursday signed agreements on developing
information technology, protecting copyrights, patents and
trademarks and increasing financial cooperation.
	   Along the sidelines of Jospin's meetings, business executives
and government officials signed 14 agreements, worth 2.8 billion
yuan (dlrs 339 million or 1.9 billion francs).
	   In the largest deal, France's Lafarge agreed to build a dlrs 150
million cement plant in Dujiangyan, a hard-luck town in Sichuan
province.

Infidelity common among birds and mammals, experts say
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL RECER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Infidelity may be nature's way, according to
studies that show about 10 percent of birds and mammals that mate
for life are actually faithful to their partners. The urges of
biology, say the experts, promotes some forms of hanky-panky.
	   Studies published Friday in the journal Science suggest that
animal parents can gain important benefits for their species by
mating with those outside a bonded partnership.
	   Females stray to gather the best possible genes for their
offspring, while males are driven to father as many and as often as
possible, experts say.
	   New studies using genetic testing techniques show that even the
most apparently devoted of partners often fool around, visiting
nearby nests or dens or clans to enjoy the sexual company of
strangers. Birds do it, apes do it, and, of course, so do some
people.
	   ``True monogamy actually is rare,'' said Stephen T. Emlen, an
expert on evolutionary behavior at Cornell University. He says
there is a great difference between ``social monogamy,'' where
mating pairs bond and work together to raise their young, and
``genetic monogamy,'' where parents are faithful sex partners.
	   Social monogamy is relatively common, but genetic monogamy is
the exception rather than the rule, the studies report.
	   Emlen said there are only two monkeys _ the marmoset and the
tamarin _ that are truly monogamous among the primates, the animal
order that includes man. All the others, monkeys, apes and people,
often mate outside their partnerships.
	   Most primates, in fact, make no pretense of faithfully bonding
for life, and it is difficult to know for sure that males actually
know which of the young in the clan are their children, he said.
	   That may even be true for humans. An Oregon study suggested that
about 10 percent of children were not sired by the male partner of
the parent couple with whom they bonded.
	   Among the birds, faithful sex partnership has been thought for
years to be widespread. Some species, such as the eastern bluebird,
gained reputations as shining examples of devotion. Male and female
partners work together closely to build nests, incubate eggs, then
feed and raise their young.
	   The truth is, bluebirds have a sex life that rivals a television
soap opera.
	   Patricia Adair Gowarty, a behavioral ecologist at the University
of Georgia, has found that 15 percent to 20 percent of chicks cared
for by a bonded pair of bluebirds were not fathered by the male.
Gowarty reports that of 180 socially monogamous species, only about
10 percent are sexually faithful.
	   Emlen said female birds and mammals that seek sexual partners
outside their partnership may be pushed by the biological drive to
produce the best possible children.
	   ``One of the patterns is that females seek males of high status
and high quality,'' he said. ``By doing so, they are able to
produce offspring of higher quality that will be able to do better
and survive better. There is a lot of research going on to see if
these ideas are correct.''
	   Several studies have shown that ``females socially bonded with
very high quality males do not have copulations outside the pair
bonds,'' said Emlen. In effect, such females believe they already
have the best, so why look for better?
	   Males, some researchers suggest, are biologically driven to
stray by the desire to spread their genes into as many members of
the next generation as possible. Among some species, such as lions,
mountain gorillas and grizzly bears, this drive to influence the
future genetically leads dominant males to kill and even eat the
young of competing males.
	   Impulses that drive humans to seek sex outside their
partnerships are far more complex.
	   Researchers generally believe that monogamy originated among
species whose young survived best when raised by a bonded pair.
This may have led to the rise of monogamy among people, since human
children take so long to mature.

Explosions hit refinery in Australia

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ A series of explosions ripped
through parts of Esso's gas plant near the town of Sale in
southeast Victoria state on Friday. Officials said eight people
were injured, one critically.
	   Two more people are missing, Esso said.
	   The ambulance service said the critically hurt person had
extensive facial and body burns and was being airlifted to
Melbourne.
	   The other seven all suffered burns, but the ambulance spokesman
said none were life-threatening.
	   Three huge fires are out of control at the plant in Sale, about
110 miles (180 km) east of Melbourne, and a large storage tank
containing gas is being drenched by spray, Country Fire Authority
spokesman Peter Philp said.
	   He said the tank was extremely dangerous and was being sprayed
so it did not get too hot. Philp said the rampaging fires were
burning oil and gas.
	   A Channel Seven TV reporter nearing the scene in a helicopter
said, ``As we approached the scene from about 30 kilometers (18
miles) away we could see a large plume of thick black smoke
probably rising about 15 kilometers (9 miles) into the air.
	   ``We could also see flashes like very large mushrooms of fire
coming out of the gas plant,'' he said.
	   All firefighters and Esso personnel had been withdrawn from the
plant while an emergency strategy was devised.
	   Philp said more than 60 firefighters and 12 fire trucks were on
standby.
	   A police spokesman said the cause of the explosions, which went
off before 1 p.m., was not known.
	   Windows shook in houses in the nearby town of Longford when the
explosions ripped through the Esso gas plant.
	   Esso spokesman Ron Webb said, ``A team has been deployed _ both
internally and externally _ to control the situation.''
	   He said all non-essential personnel had been evacuated from the
site and everyone was accounted for.
	   ``We have shut (down) gas and crude oil production as a
precautionary measure,'' Webb said.
	   ``As soon as the emergency is controlled we'll recommence
operations,'' he said.
	   In June, a plug of ice blocked the main supply line into the
plant, which is Victoria's major source of natural gas.
	   State-wide restrictions were imposed at the time, forcing
factory closures in 100 industry sectors at an estimated cost of 50
million Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 29 million).

Top seeds Sanchez-Vicario, Seles advance to semifinals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Huber victory; Lucic doubles withdrawal &QL; 
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Top seed Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario picked apart Anna
Kournikova's attacking game in gusty winds Friday, advancing to the
semifinals of the Toyota Princess Cup.
	   Sanchez-Vicario won 6-3, 6-2, her second victory in a month over
the 17-year-old Russian after losses in their first three meetings.
	   She now meets seventh seed Anke Huber of Germany, a 6-3, 6-1
winner over Olga Barabanschikova of Belarus.
	   Second seed Monica Seles, seeking her third consecutive Toyota
title, advanced by overpowering France's Julie Halard-Decugis 6-2,
6-1. She yielded only four points in the first five games of the
second set.
	   Seles next plays Thailand's Tamarine Tanasugarn, who ended
American Amy Frazier's hot streak with a 6-1, 6-3 victory. Frazier
had beaten rising 16-year-old Croatian Mirjana Lucic and No. 3 seed
Amanda Coetzer of South Africa in the first two rounds. Tamarine
eliminated eighth seed Henrieta Nagyova of Slovakia in the second
round.
	   None of the day's four matches lasted longer than the one hour
Sanchez-Vicario needed to win.
	   The winds presented new problems after three days of playing
mostly with the roof closed on the Ariake Colosseum because of
rain.
	   Sanchez-Vicario and Tamarine generally played conservatively,
letting their opponents make the mistakes, while Seles came out
blasting as usual. With the wind somewhat weaker later, Huber
capitalized on her own sharpshooting plus errors by
Barabanschikova.
	   ``I went for my shots, but I went at the right time,'' said
Seles. ``I'm happy with the total outlook.''
	   Playing with the roof open or closed ``is like two different
tournaments,'' she added. ``It's very difficult going back and
forth this much in a week.''
	   Sanchez-Vicario also said the key was to ``attack at the right
time and the right moment.''
	   The Spaniard, ranked fourth by the WTA, mixed up her spins and
pace, and said she had learned lessons from her first three losses
to Kournikova.
	   ``I think my shots were very effective. I moved her around very
well and I was much more consistent than she was. ... I played
better mentally with the wind than she did,'' Sanchez-Vicario said.
	   Kournikova, whose Japan debut has been greeted eagerly because
of her glamour, said, ``It was difficult for me to catch her
rhythm. Everything was going wrong today.''
	   Tamarine, who reached the last 16 at Wimbledon this year before
losing to No. 1 Martina Hingis, had lost her only previous meeting
with Frazier, in August.
	   In the wind, she said, ``I was playing pretty safe. I tried not
to hit a lot of unforced errors.''
	   Meanwhile, Lucic withdrew from a scheduled doubles quarterfinal
with tendonitis in her right elbow, suffered in practice Wednesday.
She and Halard-Decugis had been scheduled to play Sanchez-Vicario
and American Mary Joe Fernandez.

Body of missing British navy crewman found after helicopter crash

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with name and details of dead crewman and surviving
pilot in grafs 3, 6, efforts to recover wreckage in graf 5

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The body of a missing British navy crewman who
died after his helicopter crashed into the South China Sea during a
training mission two days ago was found Friday, a British defense
official said.
	   ``We have located the main part of the wreckage and the body of
the crewman,'' Group Captain Christopher Lebas, a defense advisor
at the British High Commission in Singapore, told The Associated
Press. Although the crewman's body was found it had not yet been
recovered.
	   A statement from Singapore's defense ministry identified the
dead crewman as Lt. Toby Beale. Beale, 27, was from Weymouth,
England, according to The Straits Times.
	   Lebas said there would be a ``thorough investigation'' by the
Royal Navy into the cause of the crash, which occurred on Wednesday
night about 90 miles (144 kilometers) northeast of Singapore.
	   Singapore's statement added that recovering the wreckage and
body would be difficult because they were located in deep waters.
	   The pilot of the Lynx helicopter, Lt. Cmdr. Andy Hurry, 36, was
recovered shortly after the accident, and suffered only minor
bruises. The Straits Times reported that Hurry was from Torquay,
England.
	   The weather at the time was good, and the cause of the mishap
remains unknown. The British helicopter was taking part in a
``night encounter exercise'' involving three Singapore missile
corvettes and Britain's HMS Grafton.
	   A spokesman for Singapore's Defense Ministry told reporters
Thursday that the search for the missing crewman was initially
hampered when Malaysian officials delayed granting approval for a
Singapore helicopter to fly through Malaysian air space to the
accident site.
	   ``In a search and rescue operation every minute is vital. It can
mean the difference between life and death,'' said Col. Kevin Meta.
	   Singapore and Malaysia are in a spat over a number of
long-standing disputes. Malaysia last week forbade Singapore
military jets from flying into Malaysian air space without special
permission, breaking off longtime bilateral arrangements.

Japan's auto production falls for 11th straight month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's auto production fell 8.6 percent in August
from the same month last year for the 11th straight month of
decline, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association said
Friday.
	   The country's automakers made 613,532 cars, trucks and buses in
August, the association said.
	   Truck production was cut the most, falling 16.6 percent.
	   The decline in production reflects sluggish consumer spending in
Japan, which is suffering from its severest recession in decades.
	   Japan's big three automakers all cut production in August.
Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's biggest auto company, made 186,322
vehicles for a 7.3 percent fall. Nissan Motor Co. cut production
9.2 percent to 96,041. Honda Motor Co. production fell 10.8 percent
to 77,416.
	   Mitsubishi Motors Corp., Mazda Motor Corp. and Fuji Heavy
Industries Ltd. were the only companies among Japan's eleven
automakers to boost production.
	   Production at truck specialists Hino Motors Ltd. and Nissan
Diesel Motor Co. nosedived, with declines of 53.0 percent and 44.2
percent respectively.

Malaysia Friday prayers turn into pro-democracy demonstration
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES more protests, police breaking up rally in mosque,

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Riot police chased thousands of
pro-democracy activists out of Kuala Lumpur's main mosque after
Muslim prayers Friday turned into a rally for jailed opposition
leader Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Shouting slogans demanding the resignation of Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad, activists used a megaphone to make speeches
calling for the release of arrested activists before the police
marched in.
	   Screaming ``Reforms, reforms'' and ``Allah O Akbar'' or ``God is
Great,'' the demonstrators waved banners in support of Anwar, the
ousted deputy prime minister who was arrested on Sunday.
	   A part of the 10,000-strong gathering of devotees at the Masjid
Negara, or National Mosque, broke into chants despite Thursday's
threat from the national police chief to crack down on
demonstrations of support for Anwar.
	   There were no immediate reports of injuries to any of the
protesters, who jeered as the police, wearing red helmets and body
armor, approached them with batons and shields.
	   The mosque was the site of a huge rally led by Anwar on Sunday,
when tens of thousands of people marched to the Independence Square
from the mosque to demand political reform.
	   Anwar was arrested the same night under security provisions that
allow up to two years imprisonment without trial. Neither his
family nor his lawyers have seen Anwar since and despite government
asscreasingly concerned by the use of the Internal
Security Act to restrict the rights of assembly, free speech, and
open communication in Malaysia,'' a U.S. State Department statement
said.
	   Australian Prime Minister John Howard said he would not back
down from criticism that Malaysia was drifting toward
authoritarianism.
	   ``I have made the very measured and moderate statement that I
want problems solved not through the use of the police or the
apparatus of the state but rather through the ballot box,'' he
said.
	   People gathered at the mosque amid rumors that the weekly mass
prayer at the Masjid Negara would be used by Anwar's supporters to
make statements. The government on Thursday said anyone wanting to
conduct ``activities'' at the mosque required permission from
mosque or government officials.
	   Anwar's last rally on Sunday was part of a series he held across
the Southeast Asian nation after being dumped as deputy prime
minister and finance minister on Sept. 2 by Mahathir, who called
him morally unfit to lead.
	   Police have threatened Anwar's wife with arrest if she addresses
the public. Officers have blockaded two streets around her home to
keep journalists and supporters away.
	   Anwar has adamantly denied a string of police accusations
against him, including unlawful sex acts, disturbing public order,
interfering with police investigations, and leaking state secrets.
	   Meanwhile, the ruling United Malays National Organization party
threatened pro-Anwar members with expulsion. Six top UMNO leaders,
including the chief of the party's powerful youth wing, are among
the 16 people who have been jailed under the Internal Security Act
since the protests started this month.
	   However, of the 132 people arrested during the protests, only 23
were still in police custody, a police spokesman said.

Rafter, Stoltenberg put Australia up 2-0

	   TOWNSVILLE, Australia (AP) _ U.S. Open champion Patrick Rafter
and teammate Jason Stoltenberg overcame early resistance Friday to
lead Australia into a 2-0 lead over Uzbekistan in a Davis Cup World
Group qualifying tennis tie Friday.
	   Rafter beat 254th-ranked Oleg Ogorodov 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 in front of
a capacity crowd of 4,900 at the Townsville Entertainment Center.
Stoltenberg then beat 239th-ranked Vadim Kutsenko 7-5, 6-1, 6-0 in
the second singles match on the indoor medium-fast hard court.
	   The experienced doubles pair of Todd Woodbridge and Mark
Woodforde can wrap up the tie on Saturday night with a win over
Ogorodov and Dmitri Tomashevich. The reverse singles matches will
be played Sunday.
	   Rafter, playing his first match since claiming his second
successive U.S. title, was tested in the opening set by the strong
backhand of Ogorodov.
	   A rusty Rafter made some uncharacteristic volleying errors as he
exchanged breaks with the loping Ogorodov to make it 2-2.
	   But the rowdy Australian crowd then saw Rafter's
serve-and-volley game start to find its range as he broke his
opponent again to take a 3-2 lead.
	   Rafter survived two break points in a marathon eighth game to
hold serve, before closing out the set in 43 minutes with a string
of powerful ground strokes which forced an error-strewn Ogorodov to
drop his serve again.
	   With the first set under his belt, Rafter seemed to have blown
away any cobwebs from his two-week break and he strolled through
the second, breaking Ogorodov in the eighth game to win 6-3 in 30
minutes.
	   The third set was a similar scenario, with Rafter taking a
single break off Ogorodov in the seventh game to take it 6-4.
	   Rafter said he wanted to force his opponent into make pinpoint
shots in order to beat him.
	   ``I knew that if I could make him play enough balls and keep him
under pressure he was going to make some errors and I'd come up
with a couple of good shots here and there,'' said Rafter.
	   ``Unfortunately, that's the reason why he's 250. You have to
keep coming up with those shots.''
	   Australian captain John Newcombe said the nervousness of Rafter
and Stoltenberg early in the their matches could be put down to
memories of the loss to Zimbabwe earlier this year that forced
Australia into the qualifying round.
	   ``Both of our guys are very experienced but surprisingly enough
they were nervous going out,'' said Newcombe. ``We took a severe
body blow against Zimbabwe and this is the year of us trying to
redeem ourselves and fight our way back.''
	   Stoltenberg struggled for confidence and timing to lose two of
his opening three service games against Kutsenko. He struggled to
reach 5-5 in the opening set before reeling off seven straight
games, then won another seven in a row to win the match. (djp)

Palestinian Cabinet endorses right to declare independent state
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Heading toward a showdown with Israel, the
Palestinian Cabinet said Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat would
declare statehood in the West Bank and Gaza in May.
	   Thursday night's decision came just before Arafat left to
address the U.N. General Assembly and meet U.S. President Bill
Clinton.
	   In his speech before the General Assembly on Thursday, Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said a unilateral declaration of
statehood by the Palestinians would lead to the ``complete collapse
of the (peace) process.'' He warned that Israel would react
harshly, but gave no details.
	   The Palestinian Cabinet, meeting in Gaza City, suggested that
declaration of a state would be made with or without Israel's
agreement.
	   A statement said the leadership decided that once the interim
autonomy accords with Israel expire on May 4, 1999, it would
``declare the establishment of the Palestinian independent state in
all Palestinian territories which have been occupied since the
Six-Day War'' in 1967.
	   That includes all of the West Bank and Gaza Strip and
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
	   Speculation has been swirling around Arafat's speech at the
United Nations next week, with Palestinians saying he is likely to
use his address to the world body to state his intention to declare
a state in May.
	   After Thursday night's Cabinet meeting, Local Affairs Minister
Saeb Erekat qualified the Palestinian intention to declare a state.
He said the goal is to achieve an independent state in cooperation
with Israel, as a result of agreements.
	   But he warned that if an agreement is not reached by May 4, ``we
are going to declare our state.''
	   In Jerusalem, Israeli Transportation Minister Shaul Yahalom told
Israel radio that Israel should react to declaration of a
Palestinian state by immediately annexing all areas of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip still under Israeli control.
	   Palestinian Justice Minister Freih Abu Medein said Netanyahu's
U.N. speech ``reminds us of Mussolini,'' referring to the Italian
fascist dictator of the World War II era.
	   Clinton, who talked to Netanyahu and Arafat on the telephone
Thursday, is to meet the two leaders separately next week.
	   Officials say there is no plan for a three-way meeting, and an
aide to Netanyahu, Aviv Bushinsky, said Friday the chances of a
Netanyahu-Arafat meeting are ``very slim.''
	   Israel and the Palestinians have been negotiating for more than
a year and a half over implementation of an Israeli pledge to turn
over another portion of the West Bank to Palestinian civilian rule.
	   The United States offered a compromise proposal last January.
The Palestinians reluctantly accepted it, but Israel insists on
further Palestinian steps to control extremists planning and
carrying out attacks on Israel.

Thieves loot art from Peru's colonial churches
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos NY110-111 &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID KOOP &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HUARIPAMPA, Peru (AP) _ Thieves came at night to Huaripampa,
high in Peru's Andes mountains, broke into its tiny 16th-century
church and stole the village's soul.
	   They took the community's patron saint _ a 5-foot (1.5-meter)
wooden statue of the St. Michael the Archangel dressed in an ornate
white robe. Villagers had carried it in their most sacred
procession every year for centuries.
	   ``We cried for weeks after it was stolen. How could anyone have
done this?'' asked Consuela Hidalgo, who sells soft drinks in
Huaripampa's dusty plaza, 120 miles (190 kilometers) east of Lima.
	   Dozens of churches across Peru built centuries ago by the
Spanish conquerors are being robbed of paintings, statues, gold
icons and altars in a wave of looting that threatens the Andean
nation's artistic heritage.
	   From remote mountain villages to the sprawling capital Lima,
Peru's churches contain a wealth of art created by Spanish-trained
Indian artists at a time when Peru was the center of Spain's South
American empire.
	   Much of the colonial art, considered Latin America's best, is
guarded only by ancient locks and unarmed caretakers _ easy prey
for increasingly sophisticated thieves, experts say.
	   ``The problem has existed for centuries, but now we are now
seeing a looting of our churches on an unprecedented scale,'' said
Archbishop Emeritus Federico Richter, head of Peru's Catholic
Church's cultural possessions commission.
	   More than 10 percent of Peru's churches have been robbed in
recent years, and the number is much higher in church-rich highland
areas, Richter said.
	   ``Thieves have already looted most of the churches'' near the
cities of Huancayo and Jauja, where Spanish conqueror Francisco
Pizarro built his first capital in the early 1500s, diocese
spokesman Carlos Ordones said.
	   In the town of Juli in Peru's southern highlands, thieves killed
a lay worker two years ago after he tried to stop them from looting
his church.
	   Church robbing also plagues other former colonial centers, such
as Mexico and Guatemala.
	   Gunmen broke into the archdiocese office in Mexico City in
March, took a priest and four employees hostage and stole several
colonial-era gold religious icons.
	   In Sausa, a few miles (kilometers) from Huaripampa, 76-year-old
Amancio Mallaopoma has been caretaker of the village's one-room
church for 25 years.
	   The church's rough walls are covered with almost three dozen
16th-century paintings of the crucifixion, sinners burning in hell
and the conversion of the natives. Six religious statues look down
on the rough wooden pews.
	   Mallaopoma found crowbar marks on the church's heavy wooden door
when he arrived before dawn on Aug. 12 and believes he scared
thieves away before they could enter.
	   Two men claiming to be art buyers had visited the church 10 days
before the attempted robbery, community leader Jose Nunez said.
	   For the first time in a quarter century, Sausa's mayor has told
Mallaopoma not to open the church's door to strangers.
	   ``There is suspicion in the air now,'' Mallaopoma said.
	   Much of the stolen art is bought by Peru's wealthy to decorate
their homes.
	   The rest is smuggled out of the country and sold in the United
States, Venezuela and Brazil, where a top painting can fetch dlrs
20,000, said art historian Mariano Soldan.
	   Carol Damian, a professor at Miami's Florida International
University who specializes in Peruvian colonial art, says she is
contacted every six months by someone trying to sell her a stolen
Peruvian painting.
	   ``The paintings come rolled up in little cases. They've been
slashed out of their frames and stuck into suitcases,'' she said.
``They are often damaged in the process.''
	   She said the would-be sellers, usually Peruvians, bring the art
in on commercial flights. Few are caught because customs officials
are not trained to detect stolen colonial art.
	   Peruvian colonial art emerged in the 16th century when the
Spanish colonizers made Indian artists paint, weave and carve items
with Catholic themes in order to decorate their churches and
evangelize the natives.
	   The artists copied prints brought from Europe but added Peruvian
touches such as bright colors, scenery and wildlife to the Catholic
images, creating a unique ``Andean baroque'' style.
	   The increase in art theft is due to rising tourism, which has
made church security more difficult, and the emergence of art-theft
gangs, Richter said.
	   ``Unfortunately, the wealth that has already been looted is very
large,'' he said.

Explosions hit refinery in Australia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 2nd graf with Esso saying two people also missing. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ A series of explosions ripped
through parts of Esso's gas plant near the town of Sale in
southeast Victoria state on Friday. Officials said eight people
were injured, one critically.
	   Two more people were missing, Esso said.
	   The ambulance service said the critically hurt person had
extensive facial and body burns and was being airlifted to
Melbourne. The other seven all suffered burns, but the ambulance
spokesman said none were life-threatening.
	   Three huge fires were out of control at the plant in Sale, about
110 miles (180 km) east of Melbourne, and a large storage tank
containing gas is being drenched by spray, Country Fire Authority
spokesman Peter Philp said.
	   He said the tank was extremely dangerous and was being sprayed
so it did not get too hot. Philp said the rampaging fires were
burning oil and gas.
	   A Channel Seven TV reporter nearing the scene in a helicopter
said: ``As we approached the scene from about 30 kilometers (18
miles) away we could see a large plume of thick black smoke
probably rising about 15 kilometers (9 miles) into the air.
	   ``We could also see flashes like very large mushrooms of fire
coming out of the gas plant,'' he said.
	   All firefighters and Esso personnel had been withdrawn from the
plant while an emergency strategy was devised. Philp said more than
60 firefighters and 12 fire trucks were on standby.
	   A police spokesman said the cause of the explosions, which went
off before 1 p.m., was not known.
	   Windows shook in houses in the nearby town of Longford when the
explosions ripped through the Esso gas plant.
	   ``We have shut (down) gas and crude oil production as a
precautionary measure,'' Esso spokesman Ron Webb said. ``As soon as
the emergency is controlled we'll recommence operations.''

China, India streets most dangerous
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The streets of China and India are the most
hazardous in Asia, while roads in Hong Kong, famous for its hurried
pace of life, are full of speeders, according to a survey released
Friday.
	   China, India and South Korea have the most dangerous streets
among 11 Asian countries studied in the four-month survey, to be
published in the October issue of Readers' Digest.
	   Japan's roads were ranked the safest, followed by Taiwan,
Singapore, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand and
Indonesia, the survey said.
	   Researchers ranked the countries based on road fatalities,
accidents, the number of registered vehicles and drivers, speeding
citations and drunk driving arrests, it said.
	   They also interviewed police officers, drivers, traffic
authorities, insurance executives and safety experts, the magazine
said.
	   People are 100 times more likely to be killed on the road in
India than in Japan, and 32 times more likely to die in traffic
accidents in China than in Taiwan, it said.
	   In China, many drivers are inexperienced and ``speed-crazed,''
the report said.
	   ``Just about everyone behind the wheel is a new driver,'' it
said. Car-ownership is rising rapidly in China due to recent
economic gains.
	   Hong Kong's streets are relatively safe but speeders abound, the
survey showed. Hong Kong police issued more than 200,000 citations
for speeding last year, it said.
	   South Korea has the highest per capita traffic fatality rate in
the world, and one in 10 accidents involved drivers who had been
drinking, it said.
	   In Indonesia, only 3.2 million drivers were licensed, although
there are 14.8 million registered vehicles, according to the latest
available figures, the magazine said.

Rugova's closest aide seriously wounded in attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A close aide of Kosovo's ethnic
Albanian pacifist leader has been shot and seriously wounded, in
what could be a warning to Ibrahim Rugova not to give up the goal
of independence for Kosovo from Serbia.
	   Sabri Hamiti was attacked late Thursday in front of his house in
a Pristina suburb, sources close to Rugova said Friday. Two bullets
ended up just above his heart and one broke his arm. Hamiti was
taken to Pristina hospital.
	   Hamiti, 50 is believed to be the closest and most trusted aide
of Rugova, the main ethnic Albanian political leader in Kosovo, who
has showed readiness to negotiate an agreement for the province
which falls short of independence.
	   It was not clear who shot at Hamiti. The attack came only days
after another Rugova aide, the ``defense minister'' in the ethnic
Albanian self-proclaimed government in Kosovo, Ahmet Krasniqi, was
shot and killed in neighboring Albania.
	   Analysts in Pristina believe the attack on Hamiti presents a
warning to Rugova by more radical factions among ethnic Albanians
who reject any deal with the government of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Most ethnic Albanians in Kosovo want independence. Kosovo is
part of Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   Serbia and the West rule out independence for Kosovo. There have
been signs that Rugova and Milosevic could sign an agreement which
would give Kosovo a degree of self-rule but would leave it within
Serbia.

Ex-President meets attorney general over corruption allegations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Staffing

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Ex-President Suharto met Indonesia's
attorney general Friday as a part of a corruption investigation
into wealth garnered during 32 years as the country's authoritarian
leader.
	   Suharto arrived in a blue Mercedes Benz four-wheel drive at the
office of Attorney General Andi Muhammad Ghalib. Flanked by aides,
he smiled at reporters, but did not answer questions.
	   It was not immediately clear what the nature of the meeting was.
	   However, at a similar meeting at Suharto's home on Monday, the
ex-leader reportedly promised to supply detailed information about
his assets.
	   He was also asked to sign a document permitting foreign banks to
open up their records to investigators so they could ascertain
whether he had placed money abroad.
	   Suharto, 77, quit in May after a wave of riots and protests.
	   Opponents accused him of illegally enriching himself and of
hiding millions of dollars in foreign bank accounts while his
family built huge business empires under his patronage.
	   An estimate by Forbes magazine put his wealth at dlrs 4 billion.
Other estimates are much higher.
	   However, in a television appearance this month he flatly denied
any wrongdoing and said he did not have ``a cent'' stashed away
overseas.
	   His denial was greeted with disbelief by many Indonesians who
are struggling to make ends meet amid the worst economic crisis in
30 years.
	   His successor, President B.J. Habibie, who is also a longtime
friend and former subordinate, last week bowed to mounting pressure
from protesters and others and ordered that the former leader be
questioned.
	   The government, laced with former Suharto supporters including
Habibie, has promised a full and thorough inquiry. But critics have
cast doubt on the investigation saying the government has neither
the will nor expertise to search for ill-gotten wealth.

Seles: Not as much respect among younger players
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Monica Seles notices two differences in women's
tennis since her start on the tour at age 14: the teen-age players
now have the physical capabilities of 20-year-olds, and there is
less respect toward the veterans.
	   ``It doesn't matter to me,'' she said Friday in response to a
question. ``Each has been very fair to me.
	   ``With some, I don't agree with the way their attitude is,'' she
said, but added, ``I talk to most of the young players. I get along
very well.''
	   Seles, now 24, didn't cite any examples.
	   She said she still felt an obligation to show respect to past
champions such as Billie Jean King and Martina Navratilova, and
current veterans including Steffi Graf and Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario.
	   But on court, ``it really doesn't matter who is playing, or how
old they are. I just worry about what I can control. It doesn't
give me more or less motivation,'' said the former No. 1, now
ranked sixth by the WTA.
	   The 26-year-old Sanchez-Vicario agreed that the atmosphere
``definitely has changed'' since her start 13 years ago.
	   ``When I started on the tour, the young players had an idol. You
say hello. There is big respect for what they have done. Now it's
different. It doesn't happen as much.''
	   But in the end, she said, ``you have to go to the court'' to
decide the winners.
	   Anna Kournikova, the 17-year-old Russian poster girl for the
current Toyota Princess Cup tournament, said of the respect issue:
``I have never been in the middle of anything like that.
	   ``I have a great friendship with Monica. I'm playing doubles
with her,'' she added. The pair meet top seeds Lisa Raymond and
Rennae Stubbs in Saturday's semifinals.
	   On the court, Kournikova beat Sanchez-Vicario in their first
three meetings, but the veteran Spaniard has won their last two
matches, including a 6-3, 6-2 victory Saturday.
	   ``I learned what I did wrong'' the first three times,
Sanchez-Vicario said.

Release of Cambodian `prisoner of conscience' delayed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ An opposition party official
pardoned by King Norodom Sihanouk remained in prison Friday amid
rising tensions following an alleged assassination attempt on
strongman Hun Sen.
	   Srun Vong Vannak, the security chief of opposition leader Sam
Rainsy, was pardoned Thursday. In a widely criticized court case,
he was convicted of the 1996 killing of Kov Samuth, a national
police official who was Hun Sen's brother-in-law.
	   Vannak's release was expected early Friday, but his lawyers said
they were unable to obtain release papers from Justice Minister
Chem Sgnuon, a senior official in Hun Sen's party.
	   Before flying to Vietnam for the weekend, Chem Sgnuon claimed he
could not sign the release papers because he had misplaced the
king's pardon at his house, the lawyers said.
	   The human rights group Amnesty International had described
Vannak as a ``prisoner of conscience,'' charging he was detained
``solely for his peaceful political affiliation and wrongly
convicted on politically motivated criminal charges.''
	   Vannak was arrested without a warrant in February 1997 and held
incommunicado for more than two weeks during which police extracted
a murder confession. He disavowed it in court.
	   Two other men charged and convicted in the case offered
testimony that instrumental to Vannak's conviction, but recanted
shortly after the trial. They told human rights groups in letters
from prison that their confessions had been made under duress.
	   The delay in Vannak's release came after a rocket-propelled
grenade exploded Thursday on a busy road in the northwestern town
of Siem Reap as Hun Sen's motorcade was driving by.
	   Police have called the incident, which took place shortly before
the new Cambodian parliament was sworn into session, an
assassination attempt on the Cambodian leader.
	   A government spokesman asked Friday about the delay said there
was no connection to the attack. He added that filing all the
proper paperwork for the release was expected to carry into next
week.

Rugova's closest aide seriously wounded in attack

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A close aide of Kosovo's ethnic
Albanian pacifist leader has been shot and seriously wounded, in
what could be a warning to Ibrahim Rugova not to give up the goal
of independence for Kosovo from Serbia.
	   Sabri Hamiti was attacked late Thursday in front of his house in
a Pristina suburb, sources close to Rugova said Friday. Two bullets
ended up just above his heart and one broke his arm. Hamiti was
taken to Pristina hospital.
	   Hamiti, 50, is believed to be the closest aide of Rugova. The
main ethnic Albanian political leader in Kosovo, Rugova has showed
readiness to negotiate an agreement for the Serbian province which
falls short of independence.
	   It was not clear who shot at Hamiti. The attack came only days
after another Rugova aide, the ``defense minister'' in the ethnic
Albanian self-proclaimed government in Kosovo, Ahmet Krasniqi, was
shot and killed in neighboring Albania.
	   The attack on Hamiti may present a warning to Rugova by more
radical factions among ethnic Albanians who reject any deal with
the government of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Most ethnic Albanians in Kosovo want independence. Kosovo is
part of Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   Serbia and the West rule out independence for Kosovo. There have
been signs that Rugova and Milosevic could sign a U.S.-backed
agreement that would give Kosovo a degree of self-rule but would
leave it within Serbia.
	   Rugova faces opposition over such a deal from the rebel ethnic
Albanian rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, which has been fighting for
independence for Kosovo. The rebels have pledged to ``punish''
anyone who gives up that goal.
	   But the militants, who had control over some 40 percent of
Kosovo half a year ago, have been largely defeated by Serbian
police and the Yugoslav army after seven months of fighting.
	   Serb sources in Pristina said Friday that the government forces
had ended the latest offensive in the Cicavica mountain, northwest
of the capital Pristina, and rooted out the rebels. A mop-up
operation was underway, they said, indicating lower-level fighting
was continuing.
	   It was unclear whether any reduction of fighting was tied to
stepped-up NATO moves to prepare possible air and missile strikes
against government targets unless the offensive stopped.
	   More than 15,000 people have been displaced in the latest
fighting, aid officials said.
	   The Serb crackdown in Kosovo has sent upward 275,000 people
fleeing and claimed hundreds of lives. It has also caused world
alarm over the humanitarian situation, primarily because the
dangers of mass deaths among the estimated 50,000 unsheltered
refugees most at risk by approaching winter.
	   Backed by a tough U.N. resolution, NATO instructed its generals
Thursday to prepare for air strikes unless Milosevic, the Yugoslav
president, halts its attacks against remnants of KLA.
	   But a defiant Milosevic said NATO threats ``only feed the
illusions'' of the rebels.
	   During a meeting Thursday with chief U.N. refugee official
Sadako Ogata, Milosevic said that ``pressures on Yugoslavia ... do
not contribute to solving the problems.''
	   To reinforce that message, the ruling Socialist Party, in a
meeting chaired by Milosevic, blamed ``Albanian separatism and
terrorism'' for the crisis and declared that ``rooting out
terrorism'' is Yugoslavia's top national priority.

Viagra said to score higher among Asian than American men
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Clinical trials of the anti-impotence
drug Viagra revealed the drug is more effective among Asian than
Americans men, local newspapers reported Friday.
	   Effectiveness rate among the 4,500 men tested in the United
States was approximately 70 percent, while 81 percent of the men
suffering from erectile dysfunction in Thailand, Hong Kong and
Indonesia reported improved erection after twelve weeks of use, the
Bangkok Post quoted a report from the manufacturer Pfizer as
saying.
	   The drug is one of the best-selling new drugs in the United
States, with over 3 million prescriptions filled and sales of dlrs
600 million, The Nation newspaper reported the company's Thailand
general manager, Beyhan Zaim, as saying.
	   The positive result of the test is expected to help boost sales
in Asia, company official said.
	   ``The safety and efficacy results demonstrated in Pfizer's
large-scale clinical trials are outstanding,'' Dr. Apichat
Kongkanand, a urologist at the Chulalongkorn Hospital and one of
the investigators in the test, was quoted as saying.
	   The drug was approved by the Thai food and Drug Administration
last month and became available through prescription just two weeks
ago. Thailand was the first Asian country to approve the sale of
the drug.
	   Pfizer last month opened a health center in Bangkok to educate
men on the causes and cures of impotence and other health problems.

Many Russians won't get access to savings until Nov. 30
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A plan to pay out money to Russians from their
frozen bank accounts won't begin until Nov. 30, two weeks later
than previously planned, news reports said Friday.
	   Russia's new government is trying to bail out the country's
troubled commercial banks, which have been largely paralyzed by the
economic crisis that hit last month. Most of the major banks are
either closed or have been conducting only limited transactions.
	   As part of a plan to protect ordinary citizens, the government
has said that individual depositors may transfer their savings from
the ailing commercial banks to the state-controlled Sberbank, where
their money would be guaranteed by the government.
	   The deadline for transferring the accounts has been pushed back
from Sept. 26 to Oct. 10, and the date for making withdrawals has
been delayed from Nov. 15 to Nov. 30, the Central Bank said,
according to Russian news agencies.
	   The bank gave no reason for the later payment date.
	   The Central Bank feared a collapse of the country's banking
system and on Sept. 2 ordered six of Russia's largest banks to
close their branches temporarily and transfer personal accounts to
Sberbank.
	   However, many Russians keep their savings accounts in U.S.
dollars, and those accounts will be converted to rubles at the
official rate of Sept. 1, which was 9.3 rubles to the dollar.
	   That means people with dollar accounts are likely to lose a
substantial portion of their money. The ruble is currently trading
at around 15 to the dollar and is expected to go lower.
	   Some bank branches are still operating, but limit the amount of
money that customers can withdraw. Most business accounts have been
frozen, making it impossible for firms to make payments and bank
transfers. This has clogged up the country's entire financial
network.
	   The new government of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has been
providing billions of rubles worth of credits and loans to the
banks in a bid to revive the financial system.
	   Some banks have been clearing up their debts, but it's still not
clear which will be able to resume normal operations soon, and
which are too debt-ridden to be rescued.
	   Primakov's government on Thursday outlined its plans for pulling
Russia out of its economic turmoil, including paying off wage
arrears and compensating the poor for high inflation.
	   Primakov proposed greater government intervention in the economy
and a more tightly knit social safety net. But he made it clear
that there would be no return to Soviet-style state socialism.

Profit-taking slows Asian markets, but so does the U.S. bailout
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads with 14 grafs to UPDATE with Tokyo's Nikkei closing
lower, led by a big fall in banking shares.
 &UR; By THOMAS WAGNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ As they have many times before, Asian stock markets
followed the lead of Wall Street on Friday, and used profit-taking
to whittle away at big gains from the day before.
	   But a new development in the United States _ the near-collapse
of a major hedge-fund business _ also unnerved some investors.
	   On Thursday, Asia's battered bourses had seen big improvements,
thanks to a strong hint by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
that U.S. interest rates will be cut next week.
	   The key market indexes had jumped 3 percent in Tokyo, 4.4
percent in Hong Kong, and 3.4 percent in Singapore. Smaller markets
had done even better, with indexes surging 8.2 percent in Bangkok,
6.6 percent in Seoul, and 7.6 percent in Indonesia.
	   But Friday was just the opposite, by and large, thanks mainly to
traders selling shares to cash in on the sharp gains.
	   In Japan, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell
481.94 points, or 3.39 percent, to close at 13,723.84 points. That
more than erased Thursday's gains.
	   Analysts said Tokyo was reacting to the Dow Jones industrial
average, which closed 1.9 percent lower Thursday, thanks to
profit-taking following Wednesday's big 3.3 percent jump.
	   But in a region of shell-shocked markets that are always looking
for any warning that Asia's crisis is going global, traders also
seemed concerned about the United States.
	   Late Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of New York
orchestrated a dlrs 3.5 billion bailout of Long-Term Capital
Management LP, a hedge-fund business, by a consortium of banks and
brokerage firms.
	   The New York Fed acted because it was concerned that the failure
of Long-Term Capital would jeopardize the nation's financial
system. The fund had more than dlrs 90 billion invested in complex
bets in financial markets around the world.
	   On Friday, shares of Japanese banks led the way, down an average
of 4.2 percent because of concerns about the health of the entire
U.S. financial system following the bailout, traders said. The
market also was reacting to a dispute by Japanese lawmakers over
legislation to reform Japan's ailing financial system.
	   The rescue of Long-Term Capital by the consortium has generated
fears that more losses are possible at other financial institutions
in the United States, the traders said.
	   ``With concerns about the overall financial system mounting,
players have refrained from buying Japanese stocks actively,'' said
Yasuo Ueki, a general manager at Nikko Securities in Tokyo.
	   In Hong Kong, the blue chip Hang Seng Index was down 169.51
points, or 2.2 percent, to 7665.10 at midday Friday.
	   There, traders also blamed the Dow Jones fall and fears that the
Long-Term Capital Management bailout indicates that other U.S.
institutions may be sitting on bad news.
	   ``I think the U.S. market is a concern, obviously. It highlights
the risk in the hedge-fund market,'' said Alice Leung, a senior
investment analyst with Worldsec International Ltd.
	   Singapore stocks also fell, with investors taking profits after
Thursday's robust gains. The bellwether Straits Times Index fell
16.1 points, or 1.7 percent, to 915.88 at midday Friday.

Philippine government to inspect all ships similar to sunken ferry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine government will
inspect all ships in the country that are similar in design to a
ferry that sank last week in a tropical storm, killing at least 46
people, officials said Friday.
	   Forty-five passengers and crew are still missing from the
sinking of the Princess of the Orient, which was carrying 454
people when it went down outside Manila Bay.
	   Oil continued to leak from the downed ship, threatening fishing
waters off Cavite and Batangas provinces. Coast guard spokesman
Jaime Daquilanea said the oil slick was still minimal and has not
affected coastal villages.
	   Maritime officials had earlier ordered the ferry's owner,
Sulpicio Lines, to suspend its operation of seven similar ships,
which carry both passengers and cargo, to ensure their
seaworthiness and the competence of their crews.
	   Cargo ships are not included in the widened inspections, which
apply to ships of all companies.
	   The Princess of the Orient was sailing for the central city of
Cebu when it sank during a storm several hours after leaving
Manila.
	   Survivors said it listed toward its left in strong waves and
quickly sank. An investigation into the accident is underway.
	   ``While everybody is looking closely at the accident, it is a
good time to inspect all the other ships,'' said Prime Pimentel,
safety engineer of the government's Maritime Industry Authority.
	   Officials did not immediately know how many ships would be
covered by the inspections.
	   Sulpicio Lines has a total of 32 ships. It also owned the Dona
Paz, a ferry which collided with a tanker in 1987, killing 4,341 in
the world's worst peacetime shipping disaster. A year later, 250
people died in the sinking of another ship owned by the company,
the Dona Marilyn.
	   Ships and ferries are the main mode of transportation is this
country of 7,107 islands. Many of the vessels are old.

Philippines withdraws as host of World Expo 2002
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada said Friday
he has decided to withdraw the Philippines as host of World Expo
2002 because of the country's economic problems.
	   ``I made the decision for the welfare of the nation ... now that
we are in a crisis,'' Estrada said in a radio interview.
	   Tourism Secretary Gemma Cruz-Araneta earlier announced Estrada's
decision to surprised travel industry leaders, who had been meeting
on ways to push the project.
	   Senate leader Blas Ople said he was inclined to support Estrada,
but he will call for a Senate inquiry ``to assess the impact of
this decision on our international relations.''
	   Withdrawing as host would ``send the wrong message'' to the
international community as the Philippines tries to win investor
confidence, said former Tourism Secretary Mina Gabor, who lobbied
for the Philippines to win in June over Australia to host the
exposition.
	   Estrada was concerned that the government may have to shoulder
the entire 6 billion pesos (dlrs 135 million) needed to host the
event if the private sector is unable to cover half the amount it
reportedly promised because of the economic downturn.
	   ``I decided that instead of spending 6 billion pesos for the
World Expo, it would be better to spend the money for agriculture _
farm-to-market roads, irrigation _ which are needed by our
farmers,'' Estrada said.
	   Ms. Gabor, however, said only dlrs 116 million would be needed
and the government would account for only 32 percent of the cost.
She said Estrada may not have been properly briefed on the project.
	   She said at least 3.7 million tourists would be expected to
attend the exposition. About 60 countries were expected to
participate.
	   Alberto Fenix, president of the Philippine Chamber of Commerce
and Industry and a member of the commission in charge of the Expo,
asked Estrada to reconsider his decision.

Palestinian Cabinet endorses right to declare independent state
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Heading toward a showdown with Israel, the
Palestinian Cabinet has said Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will
declare statehood in the West Bank and Gaza in May.
	   Thursday night's announcement came just before Arafat left to
address the U.N. General Assembly and meet U.S. President Bill
Clinton.
	   In his Thursday speech before the General Assembly, Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said a unilateral declaration of
statehood by the Palestinians would lead to the ``complete collapse
of the (peace) process.'' He warned that Israel would react
harshly, but gave no details.
	   The Palestinian Cabinet, meeting in Gaza City, suggested that
declaration of a state would be made with or without Israel's
agreement.
	   A statement said the leadership decided that once the interim
autonomy accords with Israel expire on May 4, 1999, it would
``declare the establishment of the Palestinian independent state in
all Palestinian territories which have been occupied since the
Six-Day War'' in 1967.
	   That includes all of the West Bank and Gaza Strip and
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
	   Speculation has been swirling around Arafat's speech at the
United Nations next week, with Palestinians saying he is likely to
use the address to express his intention to declare a state in May.
	   After Thursday night's Cabinet meeting, Local Affairs Minister
Saeb Erekat qualified the Palestinian intention to declare a state.
He said the goal is to achieve an independent state in cooperation
with Israel, as a result of agreements.
	   But he warned that if an agreement is not reached by May 4, ``we
are going to declare our state.''
	   In Jerusalem, Israeli Transportation Minister Shaul Yahalom told
Israel radio that Israel should react to declaration of a
Palestinian state by immediately annexing all areas of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip still under Israeli control.
	   Palestinian Justice Minister Freih Abu Medein said Netanyahu's
U.N. speech ``reminds us of Mussolini,'' referring to the Italian
fascist dictator of the World War II era.
	   Clinton, who talked to Netanyahu and Arafat on the telephone
Thursday, is to meet the two leaders separately next week.
	   Officials say there is no plan for a three-way meeting, and an
aide to Netanyahu, Aviv Bushinsky, said Friday the chances of a
Netanyahu-Arafat meeting are ``very slim.''
	   Israel and the Palestinians have been negotiating for more than
a year and a half over implementation of an Israeli pledge to turn
over another portion of the West Bank to Palestinian civilian rule.
	   The United States offered a compromise proposal last January.
The Palestinians reluctantly accepted it, but Israel insists on
further Palestinian steps to control militants planning and
carrying out attacks on Israel.

Government: Suspect in rocket attack on Cambodian leader escaped

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ One of the main suspects in a rocket
attack on Cambodian leader Hun Sen's convoy has escaped, the
government said Friday. Eight others were being detained for
questioning.
	   A rocket-propelled grenade exploded as Hun Sen's convoy was
passing on a busy road in the northwestern province of Siem Reap on
Thursday. Hun Sen escaped injury, but a 12-year-old boy sitting
along the road was killed.
	   ``One man who was present at the scene 10 minutes before the
motorcade came has disappeared,'' said government spokesman Khieu
Kanharith, who refused to disclose the man's identity. ``We are 70
percent sure that he is the perpetrator of this attack.''
	   He added that eight men were in custody, but would provide no
other details.
	   Hun Sen _ who has on at least four occasions claimed to be the
victim of an assassination attempt _ immediately accused the
opposition of being behind the failed plot.
	   But Khieu Kanharith cautioned against prematurely laying the
blame on the two main opposition parties _ Prince Norodom
Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party and the Sam Rainsy Party.
	   ``Let the police investigate and make their own conclusions,''
Khieu Kanharith said at a press conference. ``We don't want to
influence public opinion or the investigation.''
	   Thursday's incident took place shortly before 121 elected
lawmakers gathered at the residence of King Norodom Sihanouk for
the opening of the National Assembly.
	   They were then sworn in at Cambodia's historic Angkor Wat
temple. One elected lawmaker was absent, apparently out of the
country.
	   The swearing-in ceremony followed weeks of jousting between the
opposition and Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party, which
captured a slight majority in July 26 parliamentary elections.
	   FUNCINPEC and the Sam Rainsy Party, which together won 58 of 122
seats in the National Assembly, accused Hun Sen of winning through
fraud and intimidation and threatened to boycott parliament.
	   They organized massive street rallies calling for Hun Sen's
ouster, but as the situation threatened to spin out of control, the
opposition agreed to attend.
	   The July elections were held one year after Hun Sen ousted
Ranariddh as his co-premier in a violent coup. It was hoped the
polls would return stability to Cambodia, but the attack showed the
political climate remained as shaky as ever. Parliament will begin
regular sessions next week.
	   Hun Sen returned to the capital immediately after the
swearing-in ceremony, while opposition leaders Ranariddh and Sam
Rainsy flew to Bangkok, Thailand, on Friday following the lifting
of a controversial travel ban on opposition members of parliament.
	   The ban was put in place after a Sept. 7 grenade attack on Hun
Sen's Phnom Penh residence. Hun Sen was not home and no one was
injured in the attack.

U.S. general consulate in Hamburg still on alert for attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ A dozen police cars and several armored
personnel carriers guarded the U.S. general consulate in Hamburg
early Friday, an increased security patrol in response to
information of a planned attack.
	   The road to the consulate was blocked for a second day, and a
police boat patrolled the waters of the Alster river near the
building.
	   The extra security will continue at least until Monday, when
police plan to consider relieving some of the dozens of extra
officers, police spokesman Reinhard Fallack said Friday.
	   He said authorities learned of the threat early this week from a
``first-class source,'' although Fallak has refused to comment on
who investigators believed was planning the attack. No arrests have
been made.
	   Police divers have been checking the river and air traffic
controllers have been instructed to notify police of any
unauthorized flights over the area.
	   Security was tightened at U.S. offices worldwide after the Aug.
7 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   A suspected close associate of Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden,
who is wanted by U.S. officials for those attacks, was arrested
last week by German officials acting on a U.S. warrant, raising
concerns of possible reprisals on German soil.
	   Mamdouh Mahmoud Salim, 40, of Sudan, was arrested on a U.S.
warrant charging him with conspiracy to kill Americans and
conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction.

Hamas says it's not responsible for Jerusalem bus stop bombing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - In a phone call to a major Palestinian daily, a
man who identified himself as a spokesman of Hamas said the Islamic
militant group was not responsible for a bomb explosion at a
Jerusalem bus stop.
	   The Al Quds newspaper said Friday it received the telephone call
after Thursday's explosion. The daily said the caller said he spoke
on behalf of Izzedine al Qassam, the military wing of Hamas.
	   No one has claimed responsibility for the explosion in which an
Israeli soldier was injured. The two-pound bomb also wrecked the
shelter of the station near the Mount Scopus campus of the Hebrew
University of Jerusalem.
	   Israel has been on high alert for the past two weeks following
renewed threats by Hamas to carry out attacks in Israel. Hamas
wants to avenge the Sept. 11 killing of the group's two top
fugitives by Israeli troops.
	   However, Hamas' trademark have been deadly suicide bombings
carried out in crowded downtown areas or on buses. Thursday's bomb
was relatively small and the bus stop was located in an outlying
neighborhood of Jerusalem.

Tokyo stock prices fall sharply, U.S. dollar lower
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Wraps up with late-afternoon dollar, bond, comments, other
details. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo share prices dropped sharply Friday on fears
about the health of financial systems in the United States and at
home. The U.S. dollar also tumbled against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 481.94 points,
or 3.39 percent, to close at 13,723.84 points. The fall more than
reversed the gains the Nikkei made on Thursday, when it added
415.97 points, or 3.02 percent.
	   The dollar cost 134.64 yen in late afternoon trading, down 2.16
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York
level of 135.10 yen overnight. During the day, it ranged from
134.26 yen to 135.75 yen.
	   Traders said the Japanese stock market, which is heavily
influenced by the health of the U.S. stock market, was hurt by the
near-collapse of a major American hedge fund earlier this week.
	   The U.S. Federal Reserve organized a dlrs 3.5 billion bailout of
Long-Term Capital Management LP. Hedge funds make speculative bets
with money from wealthy investors.
	   ``The market is worried that this isn't the only hedge fund with
heavy losses,'' said Yasuo Ueki, general manager at Nikko
Securities.
	   Traders said the Tokyo market will be keeping a close eye on the
U.S. stock market to see if there is a further selloff Friday. On
Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 152.42 points to
8,001.99.
	   Also adding to bearish sentiments was the continued bickering
between Japan's ruling party and the opposition over a key package
of bills to reform the ailing financial system.
	   The main sticking point is the use of public funds to rescue
cash-strapped Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, one of the nation's
biggest banks.
	   The opposition has rejected the latest compromise proposal from
the ruling Liberal Democrats to use a pool of 17 trillion yen (dlrs
126 billion) in public funds.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all shares listed on the
first section fell 28.08 points, or 2.6 percent, to 1,049.93. The
TOPIX added 27.84 points, or 2.65 percent, the day before.
	   Volume on the exchange's first section totaled about 368 million
shares, down from 460 million shares Thursday. Declining issues
outnumbered advances 1,004 to 177, while 114 issues were unchanged.
	   On the foreign exchange market, market players were waiting for
a policy board meeting next Tuesday of the U.S. Federal Reserve
Board to see whether there would be a decision to cut interest
rates.
	   Speculation remains strong that may happen, they said. Lower
interest rates tend to lower a nation's currency.
	   Worries that U.S. financial institutions may have been hit
harder than expected by the fallout of emerging market turmoil also
sent the dollar lower.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond stood at 0.815 percent, down from Thursday's finish
of 0.880. Its price rose to 108.87 yen from 108.24 yen the previous
day.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Ex-President Suharto met Indonesia's
attorney general Friday as a part of a corruption investigation
into wealth garnered during 32 years as the country's authoritarian
leader.
	   Suharto arrived in a blue Mercedes Benz four-wheel drive vehicle
at the office of Attorney General Andi Muhammad Ghalib, for a
25-minute meeting. Flanked by aides, he smiled and waved at
reporters when he arrived and departed but did not answer
questions.
	   Ghalib was scheduled to talk with reporters later on Friday.
	   At a similar meeting with Ghalib and a senior Cabinet minister
at Suharto's home on Monday, the ex-president reportedly denied any
wrongdoing and promised to supply detailed information about his
assets.
	   He was also asked to sign a document permitting foreign banks to
open up their records to investigators so they could ascertain
whether he had placed money abroad.
	   Suharto, 77, quit in May after a wave of riots and protests.
	   Opponents accused him of illegally enriching himself during his
three-decade rule and of hiding millions of dollars in foreign bank
accounts while his family built huge business empires under his
patronage.
	   An estimate by Forbes magazine put his wealth at dlrs 4 billion.
Other estimates are much higher.
	   However, in a television appearance this month he flatly denied
that he had stashed ``a cent'' away overseas.
	   His denial was greeted with disbelief by many Indonesians who
are struggling to make ends meet amid the worst economic crisis in
30 years.
	   His successor, President B.J. Habibie, who is also a longtime
friend and former subordinate, last week bowed to mounting pressure
from protesters and others and ordered that the former leader be
questioned.
	   The government, which includes former Suharto supporters like
Habibie, has promised a full and thorough inquiry. Not long after
replacing Suharto, Habibie said any investigation would have to be
conducted according to the law and should not turn into a witch
hunt.
	   But critics have cast doubt on the investigation, saying the
government has neither the will nor expertise to search for
ill-gotten wealth.
	   On Thursday a senior officials said the government is
considering hiring independent investigators to probe Suharto's
wealth.
	   Meanwhile, Parliament's Speaker Harmoko said Habibie was serious
about investigating Suharto.
	   He said legislators, many of the former backers of Suharto,
``have confidence in the government to investigate the wealth of
the former President.''
	   ``But we have to follow all legal procedures,'' Harmoko said
after a meeting Habibie on Friday.

Swissair says engine control unit of doomed Swissair plane found
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ An electronic device which may
provide information about why Swissair Flight 111 crashed into the
North Atlantic has been found by investigators, the airline said
Friday.
	   Swissair spokesman Jean-Claude Donzel said divers had recovered
one of the aircraft's three Engine Electronic Control Units on the
sea floor off the coast of Nova Scotia. He didn't give details of
the condition of the equipment or when it had been discovered, but
said it was possible the other two units could also be found.
	   He said Canadian authorities have sent the unit to its
manufacturers, Pratt and Whitney, for examination.
	   Donzel said it was important the unit had been found because
``each piece of equipment discovered can help the investigation
further.''
	   Investigators suspect electrical problems led to the progressive
failure of systems on the wide-body McDonnell Douglas MD-11 before
it finally crashed near Peggy's Cove, Nova Scotia, on Sept. 2
killing all 229 people on board.

Thai prisoners farming for their freedom in new program
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY113 &QL; 
 &UR; By THAKSINA KHAIKAEW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Pravit Pumkarn, a convicted armed
robber, plunges his rusty spade into the cracked, sunbaked earth,
determined to get out of a Bangkok prison.
	   He isn't making a desperate bid to escape. He's farming for his
freedom, planting rice, fruits and vegetables on the prison grounds
as part of a new program in which convicts can earn an early
release if they learn how to till the earth.
	   ``I get one day deducted from my jail term as a reward for each
day working on the farm,'' said 22-year-old Pravit.
	   With budgets for essential services slashed by a Thai government
facing its worst economic crisis in modern times, convicts are
being asked to farm to feed themselves.
	   They're not the only ones. Even the Thai army has ordered
soldiers to use land on their bases to raise fruits and vegetables
as a means of cutting costs.
	   The problem at the prisons, however, is more acute.
	   Surang Ekachote, director of vocational training at the
Department of Corrections, said the department's budget allots only
27 baht (dlrs 0.65) daily to feed each convict.
	   Making matters worse, the prison population is exploding as
crime soars because of the economic crisis, corrections officials
say. Thailand's 129 prisons are holding 164,000 inmates, 44,000
more than last year. The number is expected to reach 200,000 by the
end of 1998, they said.
	   The overcrowding has been blamed for increasingly frequent
prison escapes.
	   Cramped conditions are another reason
	   Pravit said the cramped conditions spurred him to join the first
group of 100 prisoners to learn organic farming. He said it was
better working in the fresh air than spending his days inside a 4
by 10-meter (13 by 33-foot) cell with 29 other inmates.
	   But while the program may cut costs and ease overcrowding, is it
really teaching inmates a skill they can use after their release?
	   ``I am from a farming family so it is easier for me to return
home and grow food on my father's land,'' said Anan Sorbai, an
18-year-old convicted robber.
	   The same, however, does not hold true for many others.
	   ``I will learn the skill, but I will never become a farmer,''
said 21-year-old Lek Khuan-muang, jailed for robbing a liquor
store. ``How could I when I have neither farmland nor money to
invest.''
	   Pravit, who was born in raised in a Bangkok slum, also said he
had no realistic expectations of becoming a farmer after being
freed.
	   He won't return to a life of crime either, though, he said. He
hopes to find a job as a longshoreman at Bangkok's port, loading
produce for export to other countries.

Russian police defuse bomb in Far East
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian police defused a powerful bomb placed
outside an apartment building in eastern port city of Vladivostok,
officials said Friday.
	   The bomb contained 1.2 kilograms (2.6 pounds) of explosives and
was stuffed with nails and bolts. It was discovered Thursday night
by children who played outside a 12-story apartment building in the
city of Vladivostok, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported quoting
local police.
	   The bomb was about 80 meters (yards) from the building, located
near a bus station.
	   In a separate incident Friday, police found what looked like an
explosive device in a Moscow subway station, but it turned out to
be a fake.
	   The police found a suspicious object at the downtown
Barrikadnaya station. They called on explosives experts who put it
in a metal box and destroyed it with a water gun, said Vladimir
Zubkov, a spokesman for the city police.

Palestinian Cabinet endorses right to declare independent state
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new quotes from Cabinet statement, Hamas saying
it was not involved in Thursday's bombing at a Jerusalem bus stop &QL;

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Heading toward a showdown with Israel, the
Palestinian Cabinet said Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat would
declare statehood in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in May.
	   In its decision Thursday night, the Cabinet also hinted that
Arafat would raise the statehood issue when he addresses the U.N.
General Assembly on Monday, despite Israeli warnings that such a
move could sabotage talks on a West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   In a speech to the General Assembly on Thursday, Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin said that a unilateral declaration of statehood
would lead to the ``complete collapse of the (peace) process.''
	   Netanyahu said Israel would react harshly, but gave no details.
	   The Palestinian Cabinet, meeting in Gaza City, said Arafat would
declare a state on May 4, 1999 _ the end of the five-year interim
period of autonomy _ with or without Israel's agreement.
	   ``At the end of the interim period, it (the Palestinian
government) shall declare the establishment of a Palestinian state
on all Palestinian land occupied since 1967, with Jerusalem as the
eternal capital of the Palestinian state,'' the statement said.
	   Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza and traditionally Arab east
Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war.
	   The Cabinet did not say whether Arafat would raise the statehood
issue in his speech to the General Assembly, but made several
references to the world body in its statement.
	   It said a future Palestinian state ``will be committed to the
U.N. charter and to international decisions.''
	   In Jerusalem, Israeli Transportation Minister Shaul Yahalom said
Israel should react to a statehood declaration by annexing all
areas of the West Bank and Gaza still under Israeli control.
	   Israel retains full control over one-third of Gaza and 70
percent of the West Bank. Israel and the Palestinians have been
negotiating for months over implementation of an Israeli pledge to
turn over more West Bank land to the Palestinians.
	   In hopes of wrapping up an agreement in the coming days when
both Netanyahu and Arafat are in New York, U.S. President Bill
Clinton spoke to the two leaders by phone on Thursday. He is to
meet separately with them next week.
	   Officials say there is no plan for a three-way meeting, and an
aide to Netanyahu, Aviv Bushinsky, said Friday the chances of a
Netanyahu-Arafat meeting are ``very slim.''
	   In another development, a caller identifying himself as a
spokesman for Hamas told a major Palestinian daily that the Islamic
militant group was not involved in a bomb explosion Thursday at a
Jerusalem bus stop. An Israeli soldier was injured in the blast.
	   The caller said he spoke for the Hamas military wing, Izzedine
Al Qassam, the Al Quds daily reported Friday.

China plans new measures to protect farmland, curb floods
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RENEE SCHOOF &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ To prevent further losses of precious farmland
needed to feed the world's biggest population, China's new minister
of land and resources promised Friday strict controls in a new
land-use law.
	   Effective Jan. 1, the revised land-use law will make it harder
to take land out of farming, Zhou Yongkang said at a briefing.
	   The government plans ``very rigorous measures to improve land
resources management and environmental protection,'' Zhou said.
	   Previous land use and environmental laws have failed to prevent
a severe decline in farmland. From 1986 through 1995, nearly 6.7
million hectares (16.5 million acres) of farmland were lost to
disasters and development, according to a government report
released Friday.
	   Lax enforcement of environmental laws and rampant deforestation
_ leading to soil erosion and silting of riverbeds _ were a major
factor behind floods that killed more than 3,000 people this
summer, the government has acknowledged.
	   In response to the flooding, effective Sept. 1 the government
banned logging along the upper reaches of the Yangtze River.
	   Zhou refused to answer reporters' questions about how the
central government would pay for the shift from logging to
reforestation, estimated by Sichuan provincial officials to cost
more than 1 billion yuan (dlrs 120 million) annually, and prevent
illegal logging.
	   The government also plans to take some land on steep hillsides
or along rivers and lakes out of farming to help prevent floods.
	   Zhou admitted the process would be gradual, as farmers and
loggers are moved from mountainsides to wasteland on the plains in
Sichuan to farm.
	   ``The process affects people's livelihoods, so we'll be adopting
a very cautious strategy,'' he said.
	   The worst flooding since 1954 on the Yangtze River laid bare the
cost of China's choice of putting fast growth ahead of
environmental protection.
	   Sedimentation has reduced the volume of China's huge freshwater
lakes along the Yangtze _ which served as natural diversion tanks
for floodwaters _ by 40 percent, according to figures released
Friday.
	   The land agency's report Friday was one of the first to use new
estimates that show China has about 40 percent more farmland than
previously acknowledged. But even the higher number still leaves
China with a small amount of farmland compared to its population:
just under 10 percent of the world's farmland for 22 percent of the
world's population.
	   According to the new data, China has 128 million hectares (316
million acres) of farmland, or about 14 percent of its total land,
compared with the 93 million hectares (230 million acres) reported
until recently but long known to be an underestimate.
	   The new figure was calculated using satellite photography. The
old one was compiled from reports by local officials who tended
underreport land area to lower their tax bases or exaggerate
productivity.

Aide to ethnic Albanian leader seriously wounded in attack

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A close aide of Kosovo's ethnic
Albanian leader has been shot and seriously wounded, in what could
be a warning to pacifist Ibrahim Rugova not to give up the goal of
gaining Kosovo's independence from Serbia.
	   Sabri Hamiti was attacked late Thursday in front of his house in
a Pristina suburb, sources close to Rugova said Friday. Two bullets
hit just above his heart and one broke his arm. Hamiti was taken to
a Pristina hospital.
	   Hamiti, 50, is believed to be the closest aide of Rugova. The
main ethnic Albanian political leader in Kosovo, Rugova has showed
readiness to negotiate a peace agreement for the Serbian province
that falls short of independence.
	   Serbia's crackdown on ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo has sent
upward 275,000 people fleeing and claimed hundreds of lives. It has
also caused world alarm over the humanitarian situation, primarily
because the dangers of mass deaths among the estimated 50,000
unsheltered refugees most at risk by approaching winter.
	   It was not clear who shot Hamiti. The attack came days after
another Rugova aide, the ``defense minister'' of the
self-proclaimed ethnic Albanian government in Kosovo, Ahmet
Krasniqi, was shot to death in neighboring Albania.
	   With the attack on Hamiti, hard-line factions may be warning
Rugova to reject any deal with the government of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, whose offensive against the rebels began in
February. There have been signs that Rugova and Milosevic could
sign a U.S.-backed agreement that would give Kosovo a degree of
self-rule but would leave it within Serbia. Milosevic stripped the
province of autonomy in 1989.
	   Most ethnic Albanians in Kosovo want full independence. Serbia,
which dominates the Yugoslav federation, and the West rule out
independence for Kosovo.
	   Rugova faces opposition over such a deal from the separatist
Kosovo Liberation Army, whose rebels have pledged to ``punish''
anyone who gives up the goal of independence.
	   But the militants, who earlier this year controlled 40 percent
of Kosovo, have been largely defeated by Serbian police and the
Yugoslav army after seven months of fighting.
	   Serb sources in Pristina said Friday that the government forces
had ended the latest offensive in the Cicavica mountain, northwest
of the capital Pristina, and rooted out the rebels. A mop-up
operation was underway, they said, indicating low-level fighting
continued.
	   More than 15,000 people have been displaced in the latest round
of fighting, aid officials said.
	   It was unclear whether any reduction of fighting was tied to
stepped-up NATO moves to prepare possible air and missile strikes
against government targets unless the offensive stopped.
	   Backed by a tough U.N. resolution, NATO instructed its generals
Thursday to prepare for air strikes unless Milosevic, the Yugoslav
president, halts its attacks against remnants of KLA.
	   But a defiant Milosevic said NATO threats ``only feed the
illusions'' of the rebels.
	   During a meeting Thursday with chief U.N. refugee official
Sadako Ogata, Milosevic said that ``pressures on Yugoslavia ... do
not contribute to solving the problems.''
	   To reinforce that message, the ruling Socialist Party, in a
meeting chaired by Milosevic, blamed ``Albanian separatism and
terrorism'' for the crisis and declared that ``rooting out
terrorism'' is Yugoslavia's top national priority.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A close aide of Kosovo's ethnic
Albanian pacifist leader has been shot and seriously wounded, in
what could be a warning to Ibrahim Rugova to demand nothing less
than independence for Kosovo from Serbia.
	   Sabri Hamiti was attacked late Thursday in front of his house in
a Pristina suburb, sources close to Rugova said Friday. Two bullets
ended up just above his heart and one broke his arm. Hamiti was
taken to Pristina hospital.
	   Hamiti, 50, is believed to be the closest aide of Rugova. The
main ethnic Albanian political leader in Kosovo, Rugova has showed
readiness to negotiate an agreement for the Serbian province which
falls short of independence.
	   At a press conference Friday, a visibly shaken Rugova said
``this was an attack on Kosovo institutions and prominent public
figures, not only in Kosovo, but in the whole region.''
	   He said the attack ``only further destabilizes the situation in
Kosovo and the whole region.''
	   It was not clear who shot at Hamiti. The attack came only days
after another Rugova aide, the ``defense minister'' in the ethnic
Albanian self-proclaimed government in Kosovo, Ahmet Krasniqi, was
shot and killed in neighboring Albania.
	   The attack on Hamiti may present a warning to Rugova by more
radical factions among ethnic Albanians who reject any deal with
the government of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Most ethnic Albanians in Kosovo want independence. Kosovo is
part of Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   Serbia and the West rule out independence for Kosovo. There have
been signs that Rugova and Milosevic could sign a U.S.-backed
agreement that would give Kosovo a degree of self-rule but would
leave it part of Serbia and within Yugoslavia.
	   Rugova faces opposition over such a deal from the rebel ethnic
Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which has been fighting for
independence for Kosovo. The rebels have pledged to ``punish''
anyone who gives up that goal.
	   But the militants, who had control over some 40 percent of
Kosovo half a year ago, have been largely defeated by Serbian
police and the Yugoslav army after seven months of fighting.
	   Serb sources in Pristina said Friday that the government forces
had ended the latest offensive in the Cicavica mountain, northwest
of the capital Pristina, and rooted out the rebels. A mop-up
operation was underway, they said, indicating lower-level fighting

against government targets unless the offensive stopped.
	   More than 15,000 people have been displaced in the latest

	   Rugova welcomed ``NATO's readiness to protect the people of
Kosovo.'' He also demanded an immediate end to Serb offensives in
Kosovo and an internationally monitored return of refugees.
	   The Serb crackdown in Kosovo has sent upward 275,000 people
fleeing and claimed hundreds of lives. It has also caused world
alarm over the humanitarian situation, primarily because the

Four drowned, one missing in heavy rains in western Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Four people were killed and one was missing after
torrential rains triggered flooding and mudslides in western Japan,
police said Friday.
	   A 16-year-old high school student, Yuta Toyama, drowned after
falling into a manhole while wading through floodwaters in Kochi,
625 kilometers (391 miles) southwest of Tokyo, a spokesman for the
Koichi Prefecture police said.
	   Three others, Osame Nishihara, an 87-year old woman, Hanako
Funatani, also 87, and Shigeyuki Doi, an 83-year-old man, drowned
in floodwaters in or near Kochi, said the police official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Police were searching for a 69-year-old woman who they believe
was buried in a landslide, the spokesman said.
	   More than 800 millimeters (32 inches) of rain has fallen in
Kochi since Wednesday, flooding more than 100 homes, the
Meteorological Agency said.
	   More rain was expected in the region Friday night, the agancy
said.

Profit-taking slows Asian markets, but so does the U.S. bailout

	   TOKYO (AP) _ As they have many times before, Asian stock markets
followed the lead of Wall Street on Friday, and used profit-taking
to whittle away at big gains from the day before.
	   But a new development in the United States _ the near-collapse
of a major hedge-fund business _ also unnerved some investors.
	   On Thursday, Asia's battered bourses had seen big improvements,
thanks to a strong hint by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
that U.S. interest rates will be cut next week.
	   The key market indexes had jumped 3 percent in Tokyo, 4.4
percent in Hong Kong, and 3.4 percent in Singapore. Smaller markets
had done even better, with indexes surging 8.2 percent in Bangkok,
6.6 percent in Seoul, and 7.6 percent in Indonesia.
	   But Friday was just the opposite, by and large, thanks mainly to
traders selling shares to cash in on the sharp gains.
	   In Japan, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell
481.94 points, or 3.39 percent, to close at 13,723.84 points. That
more than erased Thursday's gains.
	   Analysts said Tokyo was reacting to the Dow Jones industrial
average, which closed 1.9 percent lower Thursday, thanks to
profit-taking following Wednesday's big 3.3 percent jump.
	   But in a region of shell-shocked markets that are always looking
for any warning that Asia's crisis is going global, traders also
seemed concerned about the United States.
	   Late Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of New York
orchestrated a dlrs 3.5 billion bailout of Long-Term Capital
Management LP, a top hedge-fund business, by a consortium of banks
and brokerage firms.
	   The New York Fed acted because it was concerned that the failure
of Long-Term Capital would jeopardize the nation's financial
system. The fund had more than dlrs 90 billion invested in complex
bets in financial markets around the world.
	   On Friday, shares of Japanese banks led the way, down an average
of 4.2 percent because of concerns about the health of the entire
U.S. financial system following the bailout, traders said. The
market also was reacting to a dispute by Japanese lawmakers over
legislation to reform Japan's ailing financial system.
	   The rescue of Long-Term Capital by the consortium has generated
fears that more losses are possible at other financial institutions
in the United States, the traders said.
	   ``With concerns about the overall financial system mounting,
players have refrained from buying Japanese stocks actively,'' said
Yasuo Ueki, a general manager at Nikko Securities in Tokyo.
	   In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index was down 133 points,
or 1.7 percent, to 7701.61 on Friday.
	   Traders there also blamed the Dow Jones fall and fears that the
Long-Term Capital Management bailout indicates that other U.S.
institutions may be sitting on bad news.
	   ``I think the U.S. market is a concern, obviously. It highlights
the risk in the hedge-fund market,'' said Alice Leung, a senior
investment analyst with Worldsec International Ltd.
	   Singapore stocks fell as well, with investors taking profits
after Thursday's robust gains. The bellwether Straits Times Index
fell 8.06 points, or 0.86 percent, to 923.92 Friday.

Swissair says engine control unit of doomed Swissair plane found
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Investigators have found an
electronic device that may provide information about why Swissair
Flight 111 crashed into the North Atlantic off the Canadian coast,
the airline said Friday.
	   Investigators suspect electrical problems led to the progressive
failure of systems on the wide-body McDonnell Douglas MD-11 before
it crashed Sept. 2 near Peggy's Cove, Nova Scotia, killing all 229
people aboard.
	   Swissair spokesman Jean-Claude Donzel said Friday that divers
had recovered one of the aircraft's three Engine Electronic Control
Units on the sea floor off the coast of Nova Scotia. He didn't give
details of the condition of the equipment or when it had been
discovered, but said it was possible the other two units could also
be found.
	   He said Canadian authorities have sent the unit to its U.S.
manufacturer, Pratt and Whitney, for examination.
	   Donzel said it was important the unit had been found because
``each piece of equipment discovered can help the investigation
further.''

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Clinical trials of the anti-impotence
drug Viagra revealed the drug is more effective among Asian than
Americans men, local newspapers reported Friday.
	   Effectiveness rate among the 4,500 men tested in the United
States was approximately 70 percent, while 81 percent of the men
suffering from erectile dysfunction in Thailand, Hong Kong and
Indonesia reported improved erection after twelve weeks of use, the
Bangkok Post quoted a report from the manufacturer Pfizer as
saying.
	   The drug is one of the best-selling new drugs in the United
States, with over 3 million prescriptions filled and sales of dlrs
600 million, The Nation newspaper reported the company's Thailand
general manager, Beyhan Zaim, as saying.
	   The positive result of the test is expected to help boost sales
in Asia, company official said.
	   ``The safety and efficacy results demonstrated in Pfizer's
large-scale clinical trials are outstanding,'' Dr. Apichat
Kongkanand, a urologist at the Chulalongkorn Hospital and one of
the investigators in the test, was quoted as saying.
	   The drug was approved by the Thai food and Drug Administration
last month and became available through prescription just two weeks
ago. Thailand was the first Asian country to approve the sale of
the drug.
	   Pfizer last month opened a health center in Bangkok to educate
men on the causes and cures of impotence and other health problems.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's auto production fell 8.6 percent in August
from the same month last year for the 11th straight month of
decline, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association said
Friday.
	   The country's automakers made 613,532 cars, trucks and buses in
August, the association said.
	   Truck production was cut the most, falling 16.6 percent.
	   The decline in production reflects sluggish consumer spending in
Japan, which is suffering from its severest recession in decades.
	   Japan's big three automakers all cut production in August.
Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's biggest auto company, made 186,322
vehicles for a 7.3 percent fall. Nissan Motor Co. cut production
9.2 percent to 96,041. Honda Motor Co. production fell 10.8 percent
to 77,416.
	   Mitsubishi Motors Corp., Mazda Motor Corp. and Fuji Heavy
Industries Ltd. were the only companies among Japan's eleven
automakers to boost production.
	   Production at truck specialists Hino Motors Ltd. and Nissan
Diesel Motor Co. nosedived, with declines of 53.0 percent and 44.2
percent respectively.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hoping to boost Indonesia's sagging
tourism industry, President B.J. Habibie has reportedly decided to
further open up his country's skies to foreign airlines.
	   ``I, as a president, have decided to allow every foreign airline
to carry passengers from its home base and fly to any destination
(in Indonesia),'' Habibie was quoted by local newspapers as saying.
	   He made the comments in a speech to tourism operators on
Thursday, but did not elaborate.
	   The tourism industry has suffered in the wake of riots and
protests last May, which forced Habibie's autocratic predecessor
ex-President Suharto to relinquish power after 32 years in office.
	   Tourism numbers have continued to suffer in some areas due to
protests and outbreaks of sporadic violence, much of it generated
by the worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   Indonesia's airlines are facing massive problems because of the
crisis. Passenger numbers have dwindled and the carriers have been
squeezed by a dramatic drop in the value of the rupiah, Indonesia's
currency.
	   Most of the airlines' revenue is in rupiah, while the majority
of costs and debts are denominated in dollars.
	   The crisis has forced state-owned Garuda Indonesia to cut back
on flights.
	   Earlier this year, Sempati, the third largest airline and owned
by one of Suharto's sons, was forced to shut down.

	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's EVA Air on Friday hinted it may
sue a gossip magazine that predicted one of its planes would crash
on a flight from Kuala Lumpur.
	   The racy First Hand weekly quoted a fortune teller in an August
issue saying that EVA flight BR37 would crash on Sept. 23. The
report had no apparent impact on ticket sales for the flight, and
the plane landed safely Wednesday night, the airline said.
	   EVA dispatched the head of flight operations and chief steward
to join the flight to boost crew morale, but said it didn't take
any other special measures in response to the report.
	   EVA will consider taking legal action against the magazine if it
publishes further articles on the subject, the airline said.
	   ``We don't want more rumors, but to be honest, we don't want to
give them the benefit of the publicity that a lawsuit would lend
them,'' said an airline representative, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   EVA has never had a serious accident in its nine years of
operations.
	   Telephone calls to the weekly went unanswered. First Hand,
stuffed with glossy pictures of scantily clad models and often
baseless gossip that frequently lands the publication in court, is
one of several such magazines in Taiwan

	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) - New plans to tackle pirate
fishing vessels illegally poaching tens of thousands of tons of
Antarctic toothfish are to be put to a marine resource meeting in
Australia next month, the Foreign Ministry said Friday.
	   Associate Foreign Minister Simon Upton provided no details, but
officials told The Associated Press any response was likely to stop
short of naval interception as Antarctica's Ross Sea area is part
of the Antarctic demilitarized region.
	   Both France and Australia have used gunboats to arrest as many
as 10 illegal fishing vessels in their southern ocean territorial
waters in the past two years.
	   With the pirate fleet depleting stocks in some waters,
``unregulated toothfish fishing in the Ross Sea this summer is a
possibility New Zealand is taking seriously,'' Upton said. Pressure
would rise as poachers fished out other toothfish grounds.
	   New Zealand claims guardianship of the 370,000 square miles
(958,000 sq. km.) of the Ross Sea Dependency, a fresh target for
the estimated 80 pirate boats in the fleet fishing for the prized
Antarctic toothfish.
	   ``The pressure on toothfish stocks is parts of the Southern
Ocean doesn't appear to be diminishing. The Ross Sea could provide
a tempting target for the poachers as they fish out grounds
elsewhere,'' Upton said.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's flagship airline has reinstated a
popular discounted fare for Filipino maids working in the island
republic one day after scrapping it, according to a statement from
the carrier on Friday.
	   After Philippines Airlines ceased operations on Wednesday,
handing Singapore Airlines (SIA) a monopoly on the busy route, the
carrier effectively doubled all its fares to Manila by eliminating
existing discounts and said the special deals for the maids would
also go.
	   But the Friday statement reversed the unpopular decision, which
would have burdened the estimated 100,000 Filipino maids in
Singapore and their employers with airfare three times the price of
the special deal.
	   ``SIA recognizes that Singapore households who employ Filipino
maids have contractual obligations to provide air travel for their
maids and has therefore retained the special fare,'' said the
statement.
	   The previously published maids' fare of 380 Singapore dollars
(dlrs 222) for a one-way ticket and 480 Singapore dollars (dlrs
280) for return passage would remain ``for the present time,'' the
airline said.
	   But the discounted fare for all other economy-class travelers
will not be reinstated, it added. ``SIA is closely monitoring the
situation and will keep discounted fares under review.''
	   One-way tickets from Singapore to the Philippine capital rose to
810 Singapore dollars (dlrs 473) from about 400 Singapore dollars
(dlrs 233).
	   Round-trip airfare shot up to 1,206 Singapore dollars (dlrs 704)
from a previous average level of about 630 Singapore dollars (dlrs
368).

Palestinian Cabinet endorses right to declare independent state
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new quotes from Cabinet statement, Hamas saying
it was not involved in Thursday's bombing at a Jerusalem bus stop &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Heading toward a showdown with Israel, the
Palestinian Cabinet said Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat would
declare statehood in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in May.
	   In its Thursday night announcement, the Cabinet also hinted that
Arafat would raise the statehood issue Monday when he addresses the
U.N. General Assembly, despite Israeli warnings that such a move
could sabotage talks on a West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   In a Thursday speech to the General Assembly, Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin said that a unilateral declaration of statehood
would lead to the ``complete collapse of the (peace) process.''
	   Netanyahu said Israel would react harshly, but gave no details.
	   The Palestinian Cabinet, meeting in Gaza City, said Arafat would
declare a state on May 4, 1999 _ the end of the five-year interim
period of autonomy _ with or without Israel's agreement.
	   ``At the end of the interim period, it (the Palestinian
government) shall declare the establishment of a Palestinian state
on all Palestinian land occupied since 1967, with Jerusalem as the
eternal capital of the Palestinian state,'' the statement said.
	   Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza and traditionally Arab east
Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war.
	   The Cabinet did not say whether Arafat would raise the statehood
issue in his speech to the General Assembly, but made several
references to the world body in its statement.
	   It said a future Palestinian state ``will be committed to the
U.N. charter and to international decisions.''
	   In Jerusalem, Israeli Transportation Minister Shaul Yahalom said
Israel should react to a statehood declaration by annexing all
areas of the West Bank and Gaza still under Israeli control.
	   Israel retains full control over one-third of Gaza and 70
percent of the West Bank. Israel and the Palestinians have been
negotiating for months over implementation of an Israeli pledge to
turn over more West Bank land to the Palestinians.
	   In hopes of wrapping up an agreement in the coming days when
both Netanyahu and Arafat are in New York, U.S. President Bill
Clinton spoke to the two leaders by phone on Thursday. He is to
meet them separately next week.
	   Officials say there is no plan for a three-way meeting, and an
aide to Netanyahu, Aviv Bushinsky, said Friday the chances of a
Netanyahu-Arafat meeting are ``very slim.''
	   In another development, a caller identifying himself as a
spokesman for Hamas told a major Palestinian daily that the Islamic
militant group was not involved in a bomb explosion Thursday at a
Jerusalem bus stop. An Israeli soldier was injured in the blast.
	   The caller said he spoke for the Hamas military wing, Izzedine
Al Qassam, the Al Quds daily reported Friday.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A plane carrying 38 people crashed in
Morocco Friday while flying from the southern Spanish port of
Malaga to the Spanish enclave of Melilla in North Africa, news
reports said.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties. The state news agency
Efe said the plane belonged to a Spanish airline called Pauknair.
It said the 86-seat plane was carrying 34 passengers and a crew of

	   State radio quoted the Interior Ministry as saying the plane
went down on land about 20 kilometers (12 miles) from Melilla,
which is located on the Moroccan coast.
	   Initial reports had said the plane went down in the
Mediterranean, just off the coast.
	   The plane went down shortly after 9:00 a.m., Efe said.

Iraq demands stronger Arab stand opposing U.N. sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq appealed to Arab nations Friday to
take a tough stand against United Nations sanctions on the country,
saying Africa's refusal to adhere to a U.N. air embargo on Libya
should serve as an example.
	   The appeal, made in the official paper of the ruling Baath
Party, Al-Thawra, said the Arab stance toward Iraq has improved but
was still below expectations from countries that share common
national interests and security concerns.
	   ``We do not see serious and effective (Arab) stands, but we see
fear and worries which makes foreign stands look stronger than
those of Arabs,'' said an editorial in Al-Thawra.
	   The U.N. sanctions were imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait, which split the Arab world between countries supporting
President Saddam Hussein and those backing the U.S.-led coalition
to force Iraq out of the neighboring state.
	   Since then, some Arab countries have pressed to end the
isolation of Iraq within Arab circles, but Kuwait has steadfastly
opposed such a move.
	   The Al-Thawra editorial pointed to a decision last June by the
Organization for African Unity which called on its members to
ignore the U.N. air embargo imposed on Libya to try to force it to
turn over two suspects in a 1988 passenger jet bombing.
	   Since then, at least five African presidents have flown into
Libya in violation of the embargo.
	   ``Arabs are demanded to break sanctions and there is no problem
in learning a lesson from our friends, the Africans,'' said
Al-Thawra.
	   The editorial also said Iraq was right in its stand against the
U.N. Security Council ``despite the lies of the American
administration and its threats.''
	   Iraq has cut off cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors whose job
it is to certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass
destruction as required by the U.N. sanctions. The certification is
necessary before the sanctions against Iraq can be lifted.
	   The government claims it has fulfilled the requirements of U.N.
resolutions, but the arms inspectors accuse Iraq of continuing to
hide lethal weapons. The United States has been the strongest
opponent to lifting the sanctions on Iraq.

Government braces for battle with communists as it unveils 1999
</HEADLINE>
budget &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's center-left government braced for a battle
with hard-line communists Friday at it prepared to present its
deficit-cutting 1999 budget to parliament.
	   The cabinet held a final meeting to discuss the budget Friday
morning. Details were expected later in the day.
	   Italy's Communist Refoundation Party is divided over whether to
back the budget, but hard-liners who say it doesn't do enough to
create jobs are expected to prevail.
	   Refoundation is not part of the governing coalition, but Premier
Romano Prodi needs its 34 votes to muster a majority in the lower
house.
	   Without them, he might have to turn elsewhere, but it would be
costly. The leader of the opposition centrists, former President
Francesco Cossiga, has said he might back Prodi's budget _ but only
if Prodi resigns in return.
	   The leader of Refoundation's moderate wing, Armando Cossutta,
has warned that the party risks provoking a government crisis that
could bring the right to power. But Fausto Bertinotti, the party's
hard-line secretary general, insists he can't back the plan.
	   The budget, designed to keep Italy in line with the requirements
for the common European currency, calls for dlrs 8 billion (13.5
trillion lire) in deficit-cutting measures. Italy is a charter
member of the currency club.

Sydney expects Olympic surplus in 2000
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Taxpayers in New South Wales state
could expect a surplus of 30 million Australian dollars (17.7
million U.S. dlrs) after the Sydney 2000 Games, Olympics Minister
Michael Knight said Friday.
	   Following the adoption of a revised budget, the Sydney
Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) said it would
cost taxpayers nothing to stage the 16-day event.
	   Knight said the new 2.6 billion Australian dollars (1.53 billion
U.S. dlrs) budget revealed a rise in expenditure after an extensive
review of facilities and services. However, he said that had been
offset by a sharp increase in revenue.
	   ``We're very confident that the surplus of 30 million dollars
will be returned to the New South Wales government and its
taxpayers,'' Knight said.
	   Meanwhile, Knight said a push to fly the Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islander flags at the Sydney Games was unlikely to succeed.
	   He said to display them alongside the Games' official flags, the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) needed to be convinced it
should alter its rules.
	   According to IOC protocol, four flags can be flown at Olympic
venues _ the Olympic flag, official flag of either the city or
SOCOG, the New South Wales state flag and the Australian flag.

Belgian interior minister offers resignation over death of

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The death of a Nigerian woman who had
become a symbol for opponents of Belgium's asylum policy plunged
the government into crisis Friday after the interior minister
offered to resign over police mishandling of the case.
	   The fate of Socialist minister Louis Tobback hung in the balance
since King Albert II still had not made a decision whether to
accept his resignation. The center-left coalition had been trying
to keep Tobback, who is also a vice-premier, on the job.
	   Tobback's move came after he learned that one of the two
policemen who had tried to subdue Semira Adamu during the
deportation attempt had already been sanctioned by the police force
last year for repeatedly kicking an asylum seeker.
	   Adamu, 20, died in a Brussels hospital late Tuesday from a brain
hemorrhage, hours after police had stuffed a pillow over her mouth
to restrain her on a plane which was about to depart for Africa.
	   Tobback, who is responsible for the police force, said his
resignation offer was based on the fact that ``a policeman who had
been sanctioned for serious offenses against a deportee was allowed
to be within the division and told to carry out this delicate
task.''
	   The police officer in question had been put on non-active for
one month and was not allowed on deportation duty for seven months
after the January 1997 incident.
	   Since he was reintegrated in the service, he was always
supervised and videotaped during deportation operations. Police
spokeswoman Els Cleemput pointed out he was not the man holding the
pillow on Adamu's face.
	   Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene opened the weekly cabinet
meeting without Tobback Friday. King Albert II was on a one-day
visit to Lisbon, Portugal and would only return late Friday.
	   Protesters had called for Tobback's resignation for three
straight days and over 1,000 demonstrators were demanding he step
down late Thursday.
	   It was the second time in five month the interior minister had
to resign. During the Spring, another Socialist, Johan Vande
Lanotte, stepped down after the key suspect in a pedophile case,
Marc Dutroux, briefly escaped.
	   Tobback, 60, had been a central figure in Belgian politics for
the past 20 years and had been interior minister from 1988 to 1994.
He was mayor of the university town of Leuven when Vande Lanotte's
resignation forced him back into national politics.
	   The government Thursday suspended the deportation of asylum
seekers from Brussels international airport until new measures were
approved.
	   Adamu had resisted deportation five previous times and her story
had touched a nerve in the nation.
	   The young woman resisted returning to Nigeria because she
claimed her family was forcing her to marry a 65-year-old man who
already has three wives. Belgium argued that was not sufficient to
grant her refugee status.
	   Cleemput said a pillow to subdue deportees was only used twice
last year. But this year resistance from deportees had increased
and the police had to use the practice a dozen times already. It
was the first serious incident involving a pillow.
	   On Thursday, the police union called on its members to refuse
cooperation in any forced expulsion of asylum seekers. Police at
Brussels international airport held a go-slow protest action,
delaying passport clearance.

Israel to upgrade Turkish air force trainers, radio says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel will upgrade 48 Turkish air force F-5
training planes for dlrs 70 million, Israel radio said Friday.
	   The deal, the latest in a series of co-operation agreements
between Israeli and Turkish defense establishments, was signed
Thursday night, the report said. The project is to take three
years.
	   Israeli and Turkish defense officials were not immediately
available for comment Friday.
	   Israel Aircraft Industries is the main contractor for the job,
the radio said. IAI is also the chief contractor in a deal to
upgrade 54 Turkish Air Force Phantom jet fighters.
	   The growing Turkish-Israel military alliance has made some in
the Middle East uncomfortable. Syria has been especially critical.
In a visit to Israel this month, Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz retorted, ``Frankly, I don't care how Syria comments (on) my
visit.'' He charged that Syria is backing Kurdish rebels in Turkey.

Ceausescu children get parents' death certificates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The children of Romania's last
Communist dictator have received their parents' death certificates,
nearly 10 years after he and his wife were executed, a newspaper
reported Friday.
	   The documents were drawn up by the defense ministry after Zoe
Ceausescu, daughter of Nicolae and Elena Ceausescu initiated a
lawsuit against it in May, following an eight-year battle to get
the certificates, the daily Curierul National reported.
	   Ceausescu and his wife's 25 years of harsh rule ended when they
were shot to death on Christmas Day 1989, after a summary trial in
the city of Targoviste, some 80 kilometers (50 miles) northwest of
Bucharest.
	   The Ceausescus were accused of genocide and undermining the
national economy. Some 1,000 people died during the 1989
anti-communist uprising as forces loyal to Ceausescu battled with
street protesters.
	   The Mediafax news agency reported that the certificates were
handed out by Bucharest municipal authorities but drawn up by the
defense ministry. The Ceausescus were tried by a military court and
shot by a firing squad of soldiers.
	   Because they were released in Bucharest and not the Ceausescus'
place of death, the certificates are not legally valid, Mediafax
reported.
	   Ceausescu son Valentin has often complained that authorities
ignored the family's request for the death certificates and the
return of the family goods.
	   Calls to the defense ministry Friday were not immediately
returned.
	   The circumstances of the Ceausescus' execution and the way the
post-revolutionary government of second-level communists took over
remains a matter of controversy in Romania.

Share prices slump
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) - Share prices slumped in Hong Kong Friday on
profit-taking and worries that the bailout of a U.S. hedge fund
could affect the banking system in the United States.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
fell 133.00 points, or 1.7 percent, closing at 7,701.61. On
Thursday, the index had surged 330.22 points.
	   Turnover amounted to 4.42 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
566 million), down from Thursday's 6.84 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 876 million).
	   Brokers shares fell as investors took profits following three
straight sessions of gains.
	   ``The market fall is due to profit-taking after the market
gained substantially in the past few days,'' said Vanessa Yeung, an
economist at G K Goh Securities (Hong Kong) Ltd.
	   Brokers said investors were also concerned that the bailout of
U.S. hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management LP, which was rumored
to have lost billions of dollars on investments in Russia, will
trigger a chain reaction.
	   The U.S. Federal Reserve organized a dlrs 3.5 billion bailout of
Long-Term Capital Management LP earlier this week. Hedge funds
high-risk investments with money from wealthy investors.
	   Among losers, HSBC Holdings fell 5.00 Hong Kong dollars to
139.50, Hutchison Whampoa fell 80 cents to 39.00, Hang Seng Bank
fell 60 cents to 47.20, and Cheung Kong fell 20 cents to 34.40.

American group brings medical supplies to Iraq

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) - A group of American activists has come to
Iraq to deliver medicines, violating a travel ban on visits to the
country under U.N. sanctions.
	   The Chicago-based Voices in the Wilderness has been visiting
Iraq for the last eight years. Its leader Charles Quilty of Rock
Island, Illinois, said Friday the visit was in solidarity with
Iraqi children and elderly suffering under the sanctions.
	   Four members of the group arrived with medicines worth several
thousand dollars to be delivered to Basra in southern Iraq, Quilty
said. He said it's the 15th trip by Voices in the Wilderness since
1990.
	   Iraq is under U.N. sanctions for its 1990 invasion of
neighboring Kuwait. The sanctions _ which limit Iraq's export of
its major commodity, oil _ have devastated the country's economy.

After months of fence-sitting, NATO ups ante in standoff with
</HEADLINE>
Milosevic
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with mandate question, Richard quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY HATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VILAMOURA, Portugal (AP) _ The NATO allies are taking their
standoff with Slobodan Milosevic to the brink, promising air
strikes and cruise missile attacks unless the Yugoslav leader ends
his crackdown in Kosovo _ and ends it quickly.
	   Still up in the air, however, is whether the U.N. Security
Council's tough resolution is a sufficient mandate to launch
military action against Yugoslavia or if further U.N. action is
required.
	   The United States believes nothing more is necessary. A number
of the allies, including the French, have problems with the U.S.
position.
	   ``It is time to stop the killing and destruction in Kosovo. Our
patience is running out,'' U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
said Thursday.
	   Cohen and his NATO counterparts agreed to begin assembling their
firepower to strike targets in Yugoslavia, though set no specific
date for an attack.
	   In the days ahead, each of the 16 NATO allies will say if and
how they can contribute to an allied air campaign against Milosevic
that will seek to check his brutal onslaught against ethnic
Albanian rebels in Kosovo province.
	   ``The United States believes that no authority from the Security
Council is necessary,'' Cohen told reporters Thursday. But on
Friday, his French counterpart, Alain Richard, refused commit
himself.
	   ``It is a serious decision,'' Richard said, avoiding a direct
answer as to the French position on the mandate. ``It would be
irresponsible to say what the next step is going to be.'' He
stressed that the allies were waiting to see concrete acts from
Milosevic.
	   If the political decision is made to launch a military action
against Yugoslavia, it would be a phased campaign, gradually
increasing in intensity.
	   ``The targets would be military targets,'' said Walter B.
Slocombe, U.S. undersecretary of defense for policy. ``Very, very
effective and very, very strong blows would be aimed at the very
instruments that Milosevic is using to carry out this repression.''
	   If Milosevic does not back down, by agreeing to a cease-fire and
seeking a negotiated solution, the military campaign would be
stepped up _ though officials won't say how far they will go.
	   Flouting months of international warnings, Milosevic's forces
have killed hundreds of separatists and civilians and prompted a
humanitarian crisis that is bound to worsen as winter sets in.
	   Tackling rogue leaders like Milosevic _ to prevent them from
destabilizing their neighbors in fragile areas _ illustrates the
sort of action the NATO alliance is preparing for in its post-Cold
War strategy.
	   The alliance also is looking at what it can do specifically for
Kosovo's more than 250,000 displaced people and refugees.
	   Officials are aware that NATO now needs to make an example of
Milosevic. ``The credibility of NATO is on the line,'' Cohen said.
	   The standoff with Milosevic, and its outcome, are of particular
interest for NATO's three candidate members _ Poland, Hungary and
the Czech Republic _ who will be welcomed into the NATO fold next
April.
	   Fighting in the Balkan has threatened to trigger wider
instability in eastern Europe.
	   The three countries have said they are prepared to participate
in the Kosovo operation.

Opposition bids to unseat hard-line Meciar in Slovak elections

	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ An unlikely opposition alliance
ranging from rightists to Greens entered Slovakia's nationwide
elections with high hopes Friday, intent on unseating a hard-line
government that has alienated its central European neighbors.
	   The two-day balloting runs from Friday afternoon to Saturday
afternoon. But opposition leaders said most voters would wait until
the second day due to fears of vote-count fraud.
	   International human rights groups also have expressed concern of
possible election manipulation by the government, which last year
canceled a key ballot question on the eve of a referendum that
could have challenged its authoritarian grip on power.
	   Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar and his nationalist Movement for
a Democratic Slovakia have ruled largely uninterrupted and
unchallenged since the country broke from Czechoslovakia and became
independent in 1993.
	   But opposition forces that share little in common except a
dislike of the hard-line policies of ``Meciarism'' stand a good
chance of taking power if they stay united beyond the balloting.
	   Meciar's HZDS, as it is widely known, has powerful backers in
the state media and in privatized industries and is favored to get
the most votes of any of 17 parties competing for all 150 seats in
Parliament. But analysts say its prospects for finding enough
allies to forge a majority coalition are bleak because of dwindling
support.
	   Only the far-right Slovak National Party, Meciar's main
coalition partner in the current government, has expressed
willingness to work with him among the six parties expected to
receive the minimum 5 percent required to earn seats in parliament.
But it is not expected to win many seats.
	   Standing ready to try to take over is a rejuvenated opposition,
led by a recently formed five-party alliance _ the Slovak
Democratic Coalition _ that includes Christian conservatives,
social free-marketeers and Greens.
	   ``We will stick together,'' coalition leader Mikulas Dzurinda
pledged on the eve of the vote ``If there are problems, we are
going to stay together, because we will always remember the bad
times under Meciar.''
	   Opposition leaders say they would steer the nation on a vastly
different course, embracing the free-market and democratic reforms
needed to gain Slovakia entry into Western institutions.
	   ``The next few weeks are the best chance yet for democracy in
Slovakia,'' says Martin Butora, president of the Institute for
Public Affairs, an independent Bratislava think tank.
	   Despite authorities' efforts to clamp down on dissent and
hamstring the opposition, Butora says there has been a surge in
civic involvement by pro-Western Slovaks who want change.
	   Meciar and his ruling party have responded by imposing controls
on the media and non-governmental organizations, calling them
``subversive.''
	   He also has drawn criticism for his treatment of the
560,000-strong Hungarian minority that comprises over 10 percent of
Slovakia's population. He evoked comparisons to the ``ethnic
cleansing'' practices of the Bosnian war by proposing to Hungary
their ``voluntary repatriation.''
	   Slovakia's chances of being admitted to NATO or the European
Union any time soon may hinge on a change in government. The EU
excluded the nation of 5.5 million from the first round of
membership expansion, primarily because of alleged failings in its
democratic system.
	   Other issues on voters' minds are Slovakia's 14 percent
unemployment, rising crime, the deterioration of the health care
and education systems and an economy that still lags well behind
its neighbors'.

Palestinian Cabinet endorses right to declare independent state
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS interpretive graf, statement by Palestinian negotiator &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Heading toward a showdown with Israel, the
Palestinian Cabinet said Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat would
declare statehood in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in May.
	   In its decision Thursday night, the Cabinet also hinted that
Arafat would raise the statehood issue when he addresses the U.N.
General Assembly on Monday, despite Israeli warnings that such a
move could sabotage talks on a West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   In a speech to the General Assembly on Thursday, Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin said that a unilateral declaration of statehood
would lead to the ``complete collapse of the (peace) process.''
	   Netanyahu said Israel would react harshly, but gave no details.
	   The Palestinian Cabinet, meeting in Gaza City, said Arafat would
declare a state on May 4, 1999 _ the end of the five-year interim
period of autonomy _ with or without Israel's agreement.
	   ``At the end of the interim period, it (the Palestinian
government) shall declare the establishment of a Palestinian state
on all Palestinian land occupied since 1967, with Jerusalem as the
eternal capital of the Palestinian state,'' the statement said.
	   Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza and traditionally Arab east
Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war.
	   The statement itself did not mention the May 4 date, meaning
that despite the tough rhetoric the Palestinians were perhaps
leaving open the possibility of extending the interim period in
case there was progress on talks on a West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   However, the chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, told
reporters after the Cabinet meeting that while the Palestinians
hoped to reach agreement with Israel on the future of the West Bank
and Gaza by May 4, they would declare statehood on that day if no
accord had been concluded by then.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Ex-President Suharto Friday handed
over two letters to allow investigators to search for and seize an
alleged fortune from corruption that opponents claim he stashed
overseas, but which he says doesn't exist.
	   A relaxed Suharto met Indonesia's Attorney General Andi Muhammad
Ghalib for 25 minutes as an official corruption investigation into
his wealth gathered pace.
	   Protesting that he has done nothing wrong, Suharto nevertheless
furnished two unsigned draft letters of authorization as requested
by Ghalib, who is heading the probe.
	   One letter authorizes foreign banks to open their books to
investigators looking for accounts allegedly held by Suharto. The
other permits the government to take back any money found.
	   Ghalib did not say when the letters would be signed.
	   The old autocrat arrived at the attorney general's office in a
blue Mercedes Benz four-wheel drive vehicle.
	   Flanked by aides, he smiled and waved at reporters but did not
answer questions.
	   It was the second such meeting in five days.
	   On Monday Ghalib and a senior Cabinet minister questioned the
former leader at his Jakarta home for the first time.
	   Suharto, 77, quit office in May after a wave of riots and
protests, ending 32 autocratic years in power.
	   Opponents accused him of illegally enriching himself during his
three-decade rule and of hiding millions of dollars in foreign bank
accounts while his family built huge business empires under his
patronage.
	   An estimate by Forbes magazine put his wealth at dlrs 4 billion.
Other estimates are much higher.
	   However, in a television appearance this month he flatly denied
that he had stashed ``a cent'' away overseas.
	   His denial was greeted with disbelief by many Indonesians who
are struggling to make ends meet amid the worst economic crisis in
30 years.
	   His successor, President B.J. Habibie, who is also a longtime
friend and former subordinate of Suharto, last week bowed to
mounting pressure from protesters and others and ordered that the
former leader be questioned.
	   Earlier on Friday Suharto attended weekly Islamic prayers at a
Jakarta mosque.
	   The government, laced with former Suharto supporters including
Habibie, has promised a full and thorough inquiry. Not long after
replacing Suharto, Habibie said any investigation must be conducted
according to the law and should not become a witch hunt.
	   But critics have cast doubt on the investigation saying the
government has neither the will nor expertise to search for
ill-gotten wealth.
	   At a news conference Ghalib said he had established two
investigative teams to locate any money that Suharto might have
squirreled away overseas and to identify assets that he might have
obtained through corruption.
	   Ghalib said the teams would work as fast as they can.
	   ``We have just been working for three days only. People should
wait patiently for the results,'' he said.
	   On Thursday a senior officials said the government is
considering hiring independent investigators to help probe
Suharto's wealth.

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ A Sri Lankan sprinter was welcomed as
a hero by the sports minister after winning bronze in the 400
meters at the Commonwealth Games, but treated like a criminal by
soldiers after he was slow to show his identity papers at a
checkpoint.
	   Sugath Tillekeratne, who won one of Sri Lanka's two medals at
the games in Malaysia, said in a police report that the soldiers
were rude and threatening Thursday at a checkpoint near the central
mountain town of Norwood, 90 kilometers (55 miles) east of Colombo.
Norwood police officials who read the report Friday to The
Associated Press refused to be identified.
	   Police have referred the complaint to the military, which has
begun an investigation.
	   The soldiers, searching for ethnic Tamil guerrillas who
frequently infiltrate government areas to set off bombs, were
annoyed when Tillekeratne was slow to produce his identity papers
and verbally abused him, the sprinter said in a complaint to
police. Tillekeratne is from the majority Sinhalese ethnic group.
	   Tillekeratne, who hours before had been greeted with a garland
of flowers at the airport by Sports Minister Sumanaweera
Dissanayake, told the soldiers who he was. The troops said they
didn't care and tried to beat him up, according to his complaint.
	   The soldiers threatened to kill Tillekeratne's brother, who was
traveling in the same car, when he intervened, the sprinter said in
his statement.
	   People, most of them Tamils, frequently complain that soldiers
and policemen abuse them at the hundreds of checkpoints which dot
the Indian Ocean island. The government recently set up a hot line
for complaints.
	   Many of Sri Lanka's 3.3 million Tamils, who make up 18 percent
of the population, accuse the Sinhalese of discrimination. But not
all support the rebels' solution _ a homeland in the north and
east, where Tamils predominate.
	   More than 54,000 people have been killed in the 15-year war.

Major find of old coins, jewelery made
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A farmer plowing his field unearthed a
valuable trove of old silver coins and medieval jewelry, a museum
announced Friday.
	   The Upper Austrian Provincial Museum described the treasure as
``the largest ensemble of late medieval jewelry ever found in
Europe,'' the Austria Press Agency reported.
	   Experts date the jewelry and the 6,000 coins, minted from as far
away as England and Jerusalem, from the late 13th century.
	   The find was made recently near Freistadt, about 140 kilometers
(85 miles) northwest of Vienna. The news agency said that the
museum had paid the farmer and another person a total of about one
million schillings (dlrs 80,000) reward.

Faced with political crisis, Mahathir lashes out at homosexuality
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Malaysia-Politics

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
said Friday that Malaysia could never accept jailed opposition
leader Anwar Ibrahim as a leader because his alleged homosexuality
clashes with their Islamic values.
	   Once Mahathir's anointed successor, Anwar was fired by Mahathir
on Sept. 2 and went on a political reform campaign. He was arrested
Sunday and police have a string of charges against him, including
sodomy.
	   Mahathir, 72, says the allegations of homosexuality forced him
to get rid of Anwar, not the challenge to his 17-year-rule.
Homosexual acts are a crime in Islamic Malaysia. Anwar has denied
the charges.
	   The prime minister said that while homosexuality may be
acceptable in the West, Malaysians condemn it.
	   ``In Malaysia we reject such extreme acts. We accept men as men
and women as women,'' Mahathir was quoted as saying by the national
news agency, Bernama.
	   Mahathir said God determined a permanent distinction between the
genders ``and we have to recognize the fact and the distinction.''
	   Mahathir, who has often criticized the West as decadent and
praised Asian family values, is faced with the biggest challenge in
decades. Since Anwar was fired, street protests, virtually unheard
of in Malaysia, have flared.

Aide to ethnic Albanian leader seriously wounded in attack
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reaction from Rugova, Albanian leader welcoming
NATO preparedness to act. &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A close aide of Kosovo's ethnic
Albanian leader has been shot and seriously wounded, in what could
be a warning to the pacifist Ibrahim Rugova to demand nothing less
than independence for the restive Serbian province.
	   Sabri Hamiti was attacked late Thursday in front of his house in
a suburb of Pristina, the provincial capital, sources close to
Rugova said Friday. Two bullets lodged just above his heart and one
broke his arm. Hamiti was taken to a Pristina hospital.
	   Hamiti, 50, is believed to be the closest aide of Rugova, who
favors political negotiation to resolve the conflict between
separatist rebels and the Serbian government. The main ethnic
Albanian political leader in Kosovo, Rugova has been open to
accepting a peace agreement for the Serbian province that would
fall short of independence.
	   At a press conference Friday, a visibly shaken Rugova said
``this was an attack on Kosovo institutions and prominent public
figures, not only in Kosovo, but in the whole region.''
	   He said the attack ``only further destabilizes the situation in
Kosovo and the whole region.''
	   The Serb crackdown against ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo,
which began in February, has sent more than 275,000 people fleeing
and claimed hundreds of lives. It has also caused world alarm over
the humanitarian situation of the estimated 50,000 unsheltered
refugees as winter approaches.
	   It was not clear who shot at Hamiti. The attack came only days
after another Rugova aide, the ``defense minister'' in the ethnic
Albanian self-proclaimed government in Kosovo, Ahmet Krasniqi, was
shot and killed in neighboring Albania.
	   With the attack on Hamiti, hard-line factions among the ethnic
Albanians may be warning Rugova to reject any deal with the
government of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, who launched a
crackdown in February against the separatist rebels. Milosevic
stripped Kosovo of its autonomy in 1989 and has since ruled the
majority ethnic Albanian province with an iron grip.
	   Most ethnic Albanians want independence for Kosovo. The West and
Serbia, the dominant republic in the Yugoslav federation, rule out
independence for the majority ethnic Albanian province.
	   There have been signs that Rugova and Milosevic could sign a
U.S.-backed agreement that would give Kosovo a degree of self-rule
but would leave it part of Serbia.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army, which has been fighting for
independence for Kosovo, has pledged to ``punish'' anyone who gives
up the goal of independence.
	   But the militants, who earlier this year controlled 40 percent
of Kosovo, have been largely defeated by Serbian police and the
Yugoslav army after seven months of fighting.
	   Serb sources in Pristina said Friday that the government forces
had ended the latest offensive in the Cicavica mountain, northwest
of Pristina, and rooted out the rebels. A mop-up operation was
underway, they said, indicating lower-level fighting was
continuing.
	   More than 15,000 people have been displaced in the latest
fighting, aid officials said.
	   It was unclear whether any reduction of fighting was tied to
stepped-up NATO moves to prepare possible air and missile strikes
against government targets unless the offensive stopped.
	   Rugova welcomed ``NATO's readiness to protect the people of
Kosovo.'' He also demanded an immediate end to Serb offensives in
Kosovo and international monitoring of refugee returns.
	   Backed by a tough U.N. resolution, NATO instructed its generals
Thursday to prepare for air strikes unless Milosevic, the Yugoslav
president, halts his attacks against remnants of KLA.
	   But a defiant Milosevic said NATO threats ``only feed the
illusions'' of the rebels.
	   During a meeting Thursday with chief U.N. refugee official
Sadako Ogata, Milosevic said that ``pressures on Yugoslavia ... do
not contribute to solving the problems.''
	   To reinforce that message, the ruling Socialist Party, in a
meeting chaired by Milosevic, blamed ``Albanian separatism and
terrorism'' for the crisis and declared that ``rooting out
terrorism'' is Yugoslavia's top national priority.

Palestinian Cabinet endorses right to declare independent state
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads with 9 grafs to ADD background on territories, statement
by Palestinian negotiator. Pick up 9th graf pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Heading toward a showdown with Israel, the
Palestinian Cabinet said Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat would
declare statehood in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in May.
	   In its Thursday night announcement, the Cabinet also hinted that
Arafat would raise the statehood issue Monday when he addresses the
U.N. General Assembly, despite Israeli warnings that such a move
could sabotage talks on a West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   In a Thursday speech to the General Assembly, Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin said that a unilateral declaration of statehood
would lead to the ``complete collapse of the (peace) process.''
	   Netanyahu said Israel would react harshly, but gave no details.
	   The Palestinian Cabinet, meeting in Gaza City, said Arafat would
declare a state on May 4, 1999 _ the end of the five-year interim
period of autonomy _ with or without Israel's agreement.
	   ``At the end of the interim period, it (the Palestinian
government) shall declare the establishment of a Palestinian state
on all Palestinian land occupied since 1967, with Jerusalem as the
eternal capital of the Palestinian state,'' the Cabinet said in a
statement.
	   Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza and traditionally Arab east
Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war.
	   The statement itself did not mention the May 4 date, meaning
that despite the tough rhetoric the Palestinians were perhaps
leaving open the possibility of extending the interim period in
case of progress on talks on a West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   However, the chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, told
reporters after the Cabinet meeting that while the Palestinians
hoped to reach agreement with Israel on the future of the West Bank
and Gaza by May 4, they would declare statehood if no accord had
been concluded by then.

Two Spanish cyclists expelled from Tour of Spain for failing blood

test &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SEGOVIA, Spain (AP) _ Two Spanish cyclists were expelled from
the Tour of Spain Friday after failing a blood test, the state news
agency Efe reported.
	   Juan Carlos Dominguez and Daniel Calvero of the Vitalicio
Seguros team had an abnormally high number of oxygen-carrying red
blood cells, according to a test administered by the International
Cycling Union prior to the 20th leg of the 22-stage race, the
agency said.
	   The organizers of the race refused to confirm the report.
	   The cyclists failed the test because their hematocrit level _
the proportion of red blood cells to the total volume of blood _
was measured as above 50 percent, which is considered a health
risk.
	   The ICU describes the blood test as a safety measure rather than
a doping control.
	   There is no reliable way of detecting the use of EPO, a
synthetic hormone that stimulates the production of oxygen-carrying
red blood cells, although a high red blood cell count can indicate
its use.

Most Asian markets open lower on Wall Street's decline

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with closing figures

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock market closed lower across the
board Friday, pushed down by an overnight overnight plunge on Wall
Street and worries over the bailout of a U.S. hedge fund.
	   In Tokyo, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell
481.94 points, or 3.39 percent, to close at 13,723.84 points. The
fall more than reversed the gains the Nikkei made on Thursday, when
it added 415.97 points, or 3.02 percent.
	   Traders said the Japanese stock market, which is heavily
influenced by the health of the U.S. market, was hurt by the
near-collapse of a major American hedge fund earlier this week.
	   The U.S. Federal Reserve organized a dlrs 3.5 billion bailout of
Long-Term Capital Management LP. Hedge funds make speculative bets
with money from wealthy investors.
	   Traders said the Tokyo market will be keeping a close eye on the
U.S. stock market to see if there is a further selloff Friday. On
Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 152.42 points to
8,001.99.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 134.64 yen in late
afternoon trading, down 2.16 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and
also below its late New York level of 135.10 yen overnight.
	   Hong Kong shares slumped on profit-taking and worries that the
bailout of Long-Term Capital Management could affect the banking
system in the United States.
	   Traders said players are worried that there may be more U.S.
funds with problems and that instability in the U.S. financial
system could reverberate around the world.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of
blue chips, fell 133.00 points, or 1.7 percent, closing at
7,701.61. On Thursday, the index had surged 330.22 points.
	   Elsewhere:
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed lower on bearish sentiment over the
bailout of Long-Term Capital Management. The Korea Composite Stock
Price Index fell 6.96 points, or 2.2 percent, to 303.79.
	   JAKARTA: Share prices closed lower on the back of overnight
falls on Wall Street. The Composite Index fell 6.936 points, or 2.5
percent, to 275.224.
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed slightly lower in reaction to
overnight losses in U.S. stock markets. The market's key Weighted
Stock Price Index slipped 0.06 point to 6,979.89.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower, pushed down
by an overnight fall on Wall Street. The NZSE-40 Capital Index fell
21.27 points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,709.19.
	   MANILA: Philippine share prices closed lower on profit-taking.
The Philippine Stock Exchange index of 30 selected stocks fell 4.79
points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,215.46.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed lower, pushed down by
investors who were worried that the Long-Term Capital Management
had to be bailed out of trouble. The All Ordinaries Index fell 51.5
points, or 1.9 percent, to 2,563.4.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares closed slightly lower. The
benchmark Composite Index slipped 0.19 point to 387.27.
	   SINGAPORE: Shares closed mostly lower. The Straits Times Index
closed 8.06 points, or 0.9 percent, to 923.92.
	   BANGKOK: The Stock Exchange of Thailand index fell 1.25 points,
or 0.5 percent, to 248.93.

Train link emphasizes Copenhagen's growing regional importance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAN M. OLSEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ A high-speed train link between
Copenhagen's international airport and city center opens Sunday,
one of several projects underlining the Danish capital's growing
importance as a regional center.
	   The train, running from Copenhagen's central rail station to a
new air terminal that opened this week at Kastrup airport, is to
make the 18-kilometer (11-mile) trip in six minutes with a fare of
16.5 kroner (dlrs 2.6). A taxi trip on the same route takes a
half-hour and costs about 120 kroner (dlrs 19).
	   Kastrup has become northern Europe's busiest airport, with 17
million passengers last year, and its importance is expected to
grow as Copenhagen becomes more closely linked with the rest of
Scandinavia and with the European continent.
	   A road link between the island on which Copenhagen sits and the
continent was opened this summer. A road-and-rail link between
Copenhagen and Malmoe, Sweden, is to open in 2000, the first fixed
connection between the countries.
	   When all the connections are in place, officials expect business
at Kastrup to soar and predict 30 million passengers there by 2010.
	   Scandinavian Airlines System, the region's largest carrier, and
its partner airlines on Tuesday moved into a new third terminal at
Kastrup. A fourth passenger terminal and a new cargo center are to
be ready by 2010.
	   Copenhagen also is building a small subway system that is to
start operation in two years.

German parliament wraps up for election
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government and the
opposition sparred Friday over a 1999 budget that may never come to
pass as parliament met for the last time before Sunday's election.
	   Gerhard Schroeder, the opposition Social Democrats' candidate to
unseat Kohl, skipped the session of the upper house, which he
chairs. He was winding up his campaign in Berlin.
	   The budget, which must pass both chambers of parliament, would
be scrapped if Kohl's forces lose their slim majority in the
656-seat lower house on Sunday.
	   The opposition-dominated upper house, which is not up for
election, groups representatives of Germany's 16 states.
	   Finance Minister Theo Waigel introduced the government's 465
billion (dlrs 278 billion) budget for next year, declaring it ``a
solid foundation'' for the nation's finances.
	   Hesse governor Hans Eichel, speaking for the opposition, called
for changes and accused Waigel of burdening Germany's future with a
fresh increase in government debt.
	   Both sides also argued about an official report on child poverty
that the government has rejected. The survey, by a panel of
independent experts, concludes that one in five children in eastern
Germany and 12 percent in western Germany live in poverty.

 &UR; Spanish airliner crashes in Morocco
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with report of no survivors &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A plane carrying 38 people crashed into a
hillside in Morocco on Friday while flying from the southern
Spanish port of Malaga to North Africa, reportedly killing all
aboard.
	   Spanish state radio quoted unnamed Moroccan officials as saying
there were no survivors. The report could not be independently
confirmed.
	   A Spanish Interior Ministry official quoted by the state agency
Efe said only that it was not immediately known if there were
survivors.
	   Efe said the 86-seat plane, a British-built BAE 146, belonged to
a Spanish charter airline called Pauknair.
	   The plane was carrying 34 passengers and a crew of four from
Malaga to Melilla, a tiny Spanish enclave located on the
Mediterranean coast of Morocco.
	   State radio said the plane was preparing to land when it crashed
into a hillside in Moroccan territory about 20 kilometers (12
miles) from Melilla.
	   Visibility at Melilla airport was poor, Efe said.
	   The wreckage was spotted by a Spanish air force plane as part of
a rescue mission that included helicopters and ships.
	   Sources close to Pauknair in Morocco said the last radio contact
with the plane was made at 8:55 a.m. (0655 GMT) from Melilla.
	   The plane left Malaga at 8:15 a.m. and crashed in an area of
rugged terrain called Cap des Trois Fourches. The sources spoke on
condition they not be named.
	   Spanish radio said most of the passengers were Spanish Civil
Guards stationed in Melilla.

Takanohana takes 12-1 lead, moves ahead of brother Wakanohana
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Yokozuna (grand champion) Takanohana moved ahead of
his yokozuna elder brother Wakanohana to take the lead at 12-1
Friday with just two days left in the 15-day Autumn Grand Sumo
Tournament.
	   Takanohana, seeking his 20th tournament victory following a
triumph in the last tournament, pulled back from the edge of the
ring in the final bout Friday and took down Sekiwake (junior
champion) Chiyotaikai (8-5).
	   The win means Takanohana could walk away with the tournament
championship if he beats Ozeki (champion) Musashimaru on Saturday
and Yokozuna Akebono defeats Wakanohana.
	   On Friday, Wakanohana was chased out of the ring in a big loss
to Tochinonada (7-6), falling to 11-2.
	   In other action, Hawaii-born Akebono held at third place at 10-3
after scoring an easy win over Aogiyama (4-9). Akebono, or Chad
Rowan, grabbed hold of his opponent's belt-like sash and quickly
escorted Aogiyama out of the ring.
	   Fellow Hawaiian and Musashimaru, or Fiamalu Penitani, came up
with a victory over No. 5 maegashira Kyokushuzan (4-9), or
Mongolian Batbayar Davaa, for his ninth win against four losses.
	   In the 26-member juryo division, just below the senior makuuchi
division, No. 5-ranked Kyokutenho, or Mongolian Tsevegnyam Nyamjav,
beat Toyozakura to improve his record to 7-6. Toyozakura is also
7-6.
	   No. 13-ranked Hoshitango, or Argentine Imach Marcelo Salomon,
lost to Wakahayato. Both wrestlers are 8-5.
	   Wrestlers in junior divisions have only seven bouts during the
15-day tournament.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Ex-President Suharto handed over two
letters to investigators Friday allowing them to search for and
seize a fortune that critics claim he made from corruption and
stashed overseas.
	   A relaxed and unconcerned Suharto met Indonesia's Attorney
General Andi Muhammad Ghalib for 25 minutes as an official
corruption investigation into his personal wealth gathered pace.
	   Ghalib told reporters later that allegations of illegality made
against Suharto's six wealthy children would also be examined soon,
and he rejected claims by critics that his inquiry was too weak and
too slow.
	   ``People should wait patiently for the results,'' he said adding
that it had taken years for the Philippines to recover money taken
by former dictator Ferdinand Marcos.
	   Suharto, 77, quit in May after a wave of riots and protests,
ending 32 autocratic years in power. Opponents accused him of
illegally enriching himself and his family and of hiding millions
of dollars in foreign bank accounts.
	   The former president has denied corruption or stashing cash
overseas. At Friday's meeting, Suharto repeated the denials, but
furnished two unsigned draft letters of authorization as requested
by Ghalib.
	   One letter authorizes foreign banks to open their books to
investigators looking for accounts allegedly held by Suharto. The
other permits the government to take back any money found.
	   Ghalib did not say when the letters would be signed, but
stressed that no hard evidence had yet been collected against
Suharto.
	   Earlier this week Suharto supplied a list of assets to successor
President B.J. Habibie, Ghalib said without disclosing details.
	   After praying at a nearby mosque on Friday, the former autocrat
entered the attorney general's office flanked by aides. He smiled
and waved at reporters but did not answer questions.
	   It was the second such meeting in five days and the first
occasion for Suharto to visit the attorney general's office. On
Monday Ghalib and a senior Cabinet minister questioned the former
leader at his Jakarta home.
	   Ghalib said would not hesitate to summon Suharto to his office
again in the future. However, Suharto had not been banned from
traveling overseas.
	   Suharto is widely accused of making millions from corruption
during his three decades in power, while his family built huge
business empires under his patronage. An estimate by Forbes
magazine put his wealth at dlrs 4 billion. Other estimates are much
higher.
	   In a television appearance this month Suharto flatly denied that
he had stashed ``a cent'' away overseas.
	   His denial was greeted with disbelief by many Indonesians who
are struggling to make ends meet amid the worst economic crisis in
30 years.
	   Habibie, who is also a longtime friend and former subordinate,
last week bowed to mounting pressure from protesters and others and
ordered that the former leader be questioned.
	   But critics have cast doubt on the investigation saying the
government has neither the will nor expertise to search for
ill-gotten wealth.
	   At a news conference Ghalib said he had established two
investigative teams to locate any money that Suharto might have
squirreled away overseas and to identified assets that he might
have obtained through corruption.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Ex-President Suharto handed over two
letters to investigators Friday allowing them to search for and
seize a fortune that critics claim he made from corruption and
stashed overseas.
	   A relaxed and unconcerned Suharto met Indonesia's Attorney
General Andi Muhammad Ghalib for 25 minutes as an official
corruption investigation into his personal wealth gathered pace.
	   Ghalib told reporters later that allegations of illegality made
against Suharto's six wealthy children would also be examined soon,
and he rejected claims by critics that his inquiry was too weak and
too slow.
	   ``People should wait patiently for the results,'' he said adding
that it had taken years for the Philippines to recover money taken
by former dictator Ferdinand Marcos.
	   Suharto, 77, quit in May after a wave of riots and protests,
ending 32 autocratic years in power. Opponents accused him of
illegally enriching himself and his family and of hiding millions
of dollars in foreign bank accounts.
	   The former president has denied corruption or stashing cash
overseas. At Friday's meeting, Suharto repeated the denials, but
furnished two unsigned draft letters of authorization as requested

Carling love-life back on front pages
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Will Carling, the former England rugby union
captain who reportedly had a romantic relationship with the late
Princess Diana, has dumped his latest girlfriend for the wife of a
former teammate.
	   Carling's messy love life was splashed across the front pages of
British tabloids Friday after he released a statement saying he had
split with long-term girlfriend, Ali Cockayne. The couple have an
11-month-old son, Henry.
	   ``You Rat Carling'' was the front-page headline in The Sun,
which featured a photo of a sobbing Cockayne holding her son.
	   The 32-year-old Carling, who split with his first wife _
television presenter, Julia _ after his alleged affair with Diana
was revealed in 1996, had been with Cockayne for two years.
	   In the statement, Carling said he had broken off the
relationship with 30-year-old Cockayne but is ``anxious to play as
full a part as possible in the upbringing'' of his son.
	   Cockayne, the sister-in-law of former England soccer captain
Gary Lineker, was in the middle of wedding preparations but has
left the couple's luxury home in Berkshire.
	   Carling has reportedly started a relationship with Lisa Cooke,
the estranged wife of former England rugby union international
David Cooke. Cooke was a teammate of Carling at Harlequins.
	   Lisa Cooke has been helping to organize a testimonial year for
Carling, which concludes in December with a match featuring the
stars of world rugby in London.

category codes:
	   KEY WEST, Florida (AP) _ Gusty wind and rain lashed the Florida
Keys early Friday, grim signs that Hurricane Georges was coming
ashore after killing at least 250 people as it ripped through the
Caribbean. Five million people in eight Florida counties were under
a hurricane warning, meaning winds of at least 74 mph (120 kph)
were possible within hours. A million more living along 300 miles
(480 kilometers) of coastline around the southern end of the
peninsula were ordered out of low-lying areas and mobile homes. The
storm was forecast to be over the slender, 110-mile (180-kilometer)
chain of islands off the tip of Florida by midmorning.

	   JERUSALEM _ Heading toward a showdown with Israel, the
Palestinian Cabinet said Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat would
declare statehood in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in May. In its
Thursday night announcement, the Cabinet also hinted that Arafat
would raise the statehood issue Monday when he addresses the U.N.
General Assembly, despite Israeli warnings that such a move could
sabotage talks on a West Bank troop withdrawal. In a Thursday
speech to the General Assembly, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
said that a unilateral declaration of statehood would lead to the
``complete collapse of the (peace) process.'' Netanyahu said Israel
would react harshly, but gave no details. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ At the same time impeachment proceedings are
moving forward in Congress, an effort is under way to revive
settlement talks in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit
against President Bill Clinton, according to sources familiar with
the effort. One source said Mrs. Jones' lawyers have sent at least
one letter to Clinton's legal team exploring the possibility, and
that the president was considering the idea. Mrs. Jones' sexual
harassment case, dismissed by a judge earlier this year, is being
considered by the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals, which is scheduled
to hear oral arguments next month in Minnesota. One of the sources,
familiar with Clinton's defense, said Mrs. Jones, a former
low-level Arkansas state employee, offered to settle the case if
the president would pay her legal fees _ about dlrs 800,000.
Another source, however, put the figure at a non-negotiable dlrs 1
million. (US-CLINTON-JONES)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ A close aide of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian
leader has been shot and seriously wounded, in what could be a
warning to the pacifist Ibrahim Rugova to demand nothing less than
independence for the restive Serbian province. Sabri Hamiti was
attacked late Thursday in front of his house in a suburb of
Pristina, the provincial capital, sources close to Rugova said
Friday. Two bullets lodged just above his heart and one broke his
arm. Hamiti was taken to a Pristina hospital. Hamiti, 50, is
believed to be the closest aide of Rugova, who favors political
negotiation to resolve the conflict between separatist rebels and
the Serbian government. The main ethnic Albanian political leader
in Kosovo, Rugova has been open to accepting a peace agreement for
the Serbian province that would fall short of independence.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Riot police chased thousands of
pro-democracy activists out of Kuala Lumpur's main mosque after
Muslim prayers Friday turned into a rally for jailed opposition
leader Anwar Ibrahim. Shouting slogans demanding the resignation of
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, activists used a megaphone to make
speeches calling for the release of arrested activists before the
police marched in. Screaming ``Reforms, reforms'' and ``Allah O
Akbar'' or ``God is Great,'' the demonstrators waved banners in
support of Anwar, the ousted deputy prime minister who was arrested
on Sunday. There were no immediate reports of injuries.

Iran shows off force in military parade near Afghan border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MASHHAD, Iran (AP) _ More than 10,000 soldiers took part in a
military parade in this holy city near the Afghan border Friday in
a show of force meant to warn Afghanistan's Taliban militia.
	   The parade _ and similar ones in the capital Tehran and Taibad,
the closest Iranian town to Afghanistan _ came amid rising tensions
between Iran and the Taliban over last month's murder of Iranian
diplomats by Taliban fighters.
	   In Tehran, the newly developed Shahab-3 missile with a
1,300-kilometer (800-mile) range capable of reaching Israel was
displayed on a launcher as thousands of soldiers paraded with
artillery, anti-aircraft guns and armored personnel carriers.
	   The four-hour march in Mashhad's main square, attended by
Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani and other senior officials, showed
off dozens of tanks and personnel carriers as U.S.-made F-4 and F-5
jet fighters and Cobra helicopters flew overhead.
	   ``If any enemy wants to do mischief against our country, they
should know that they are playing with the tail of the lion,'' an
announcer said during the parade. ``We will throw them in history's
garbage.''
	   Shamkhani, a Navy rear admiral, told the troops and thousands of
Iranian spectators that Iran was trying to avoid war and would
rather use its might against what Iran views as the real enemy,
Israel.
	   ``Today, Iran, with its powerful military forces, is completely
ready to defend its national security ... but we hope with the
patience of Iranian officials we won't use this readiness against
anyone except the occupying Zionist regime,'' Shamkhani said.
	   Mashhad, which is 900 kilometers (560 miles) northeast of
Tehran, is home to the shrine of Imam Reza, an important Shiite
Muslim saint. The American aircraft that flew over the parade are
left over from the U.S.-Iranian alliance before the 1979 Islamic
revolution.
	   Friday's parades came amid growing demands for vengeance by
Iranian demonstrators. Iran has sent tens of thousands of troops to
areas near the Afghan border, and the Taliban says it has moved
20,000 troops to the border to defend against attack.
	   Tensions between the two countries has risen since the Taliban
overran the city of Mazar-e-Sharif in northern Afghanistan on Aug.
8 and killed nine Iranian diplomats posted there and an Iranian
journalist.
	   The Taliban has returned the bodies of six Iranians to Tehran
and has released 10 Iranian captives. Iran is demanding freedom for
50 more Iranian drivers it says the Taliban is holding.
	   Iran says the drivers were delivering humanitarian goods, but
the Taliban claim they were bringing military supplies to Afghan
factions fighting against the Taliban.

Friday prayers turn into pro-democracy demonstration

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Riot police chased thousands of
people out of Kuala Lumpur's main mosque after Muslim prayers
Friday turned into a rally for Malaysia's jailed pro-democracy
leader.
	   Braving the threat of arrest under Malaysia's tough security
law, thousands of people shouted slogans against Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad and unfurled banners that said: ``Mahathir is
cruel.''
	   Friday's protest was the latest of a series this week sparked by
the firing of deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim on Sept. 2 and
his subsequent arrest on Sunday.
	   Arrests of dozens of Anwar's supporters and stern warnings by
the police have frightened his wife into silence but have failed to
quell public sentiment.
	   Within minutes of prayers ending, an Anwar supporter began
addressing the 10,000-strong crowd through a megaphone from a
balcony as others tossed photocopied pictures of Anwar into the
crowd below.
	   ``We call for all ISA political detainees to be released,'' he
said, referring to the Internal Security Act. He also called for
Mahathir's resignation.
	   The crowd responded with a thundering ``Allah O Akbar'' or ``God
is Great.''
	   One engineer in the crowd, who asked not to be named, held a
cell phone toward the speaker so his wife at home could hear the
demonstration.
	   ``Mahathir has done a great job for the country, but this _ what
you see here _ shows the people believe his time is done,'' he
whispered, breaking off to shout: ``Reformasi!''
	   Hundreds of helmeted riot policemen and plain clothed officers
stationed in nearby alleys quickly moved in, banging wooden batons
on their shields.
	   As they stormed through the mosque, many covered their combat
boots with red booties. Others left on their shoes and were chided
by demonstrators, who shouted, ``Shoes! Shoes!'' reminding the
officers of the Muslim custom to leave shoes outside the mosque.
	   There were no immediate reports of any injuries.
	   Anger against the government has been fueled also by the
government's refusal to bring Anwar to court. The police say Anwar
is safe, but have barred his family and his lawyers from seeing
him.
	   Anwar was arrested Sunday hours after he addressed a gathering
at the same mosque and urged his followers to march to nearby
Independence Square in a show of defiance. The crowds at the square
soon swelled to 35,000.
	   Meanwhile, Malaysia faced fresh international criticism for
curbing political rallies and threatening to arrest critics of
Mahathir.
	   ``We are increasingly concerned by the use of the Internal
Security Act to restrict the rights of assembly, free speech, and
open communication in Malaysia,'' a U.S. State Department statement
said.
	   Australian Prime Minister John Howard said he would not back
down from criticism that Malaysia was drifting toward
authoritarianism.
	   Local human rights activists and Malaysia's Bar Council called
for an end to the security act and demanded that Anwar and the 16
others detained under the act in connection with his police
investigation be given a fair trial.
	   The government Thursday said anyone wanting to conduct
``activities'' at the mosque required permission from mosque or
government officials.
	   Anwar's last rally on Sunday was part of a series he held across
the Southeast Asian nation after being dumped as deputy prime
minister and finance minister.
	   Police have threatened Anwar's wife with arrest if she addresses
the public. Officers have blockaded two streets around her home to
keep journalists and supporters away.
	   Anwar has adamantly denied allegations against him, including
unlawful sex acts, disturbing public order, interfering with police
investigations, and leaking state secrets.

IMF team wraps up visit, but no sign of loan money

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Despite Russia's pleas for cash, an International
Monetary Fund team wrapped up a visit Friday without recommending
that Moscow receive the next installment on a dlrs 22.6 billion
loan package.
	   Russia wants the money to help stabilize an economy wracked by
surging inflation, rising unemployment and a falling currency. But
the IMF team left without agreeing to release additional money and
will return for further negotiations on Oct. 12, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   ``Reaching an agreement between the IMF and Russia is important
for both of us,'' the head of the Russian delegation, Deputy Prime
Minister Alexander Shohkin, said before Friday's talks. ``Today we
need such support very much.''
	   Russia signed the loan agreement with the IMF and other
international lenders in July, and shortly thereafter received the
first installment from the IMF, worth dlrs 4.8 billion. However,
that did not prevent Russia from sliding into a full-fledged crisis
last month.
	   Russia has been hoping for another dlrs 4.3 billion from the IMF
by the end of September. But the IMF has indicated that it doesn't
intend to release more money to Russia until it's satisfied that
the country has sound economic policies in place.
	   In another development, a plan to pay out money to Russians from
their frozen bank accounts won't begin until Nov. 30, two weeks
later than previously planned, news reports said.
	   Russia's new government is trying to bail out the country's
troubled commercial banks, which have been largely paralyzed by the
economic crisis. Most major banks are either closed or have been
conducting only limited transactions.
	   As part of a plan to protect ordinary citizens, the government
has said that individual depositors may transfer their savings from
the ailing commercial banks to the state-controlled Sberbank, where
their money would be guaranteed by the government.
	   The Central Bank feared a collapse of the country's banking
system and on Sept. 2 ordered six of Russia's largest banks to
close their branches temporarily and transfer personal accounts to
Sberbank.
	   Some bank branches are still operating, but limit the amount of
money that customers can withdraw. Most business accounts have been
frozen, making it impossible for firms to make payments and bank
transfers. This has clogged up the country's entire financial
network.
	   The new government of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has been
providing billions of rubles worth of credits and loans to the
banks in a bid to get money flowing through the financial system.
	   Some banks have been clearing up their debts, but it's still not
clear which will be able to resume normal operations soon, and
which are too debt-ridden to be rescued.
	   In another development Friday, President Boris Yeltsin filled
many of the cabinet posts that had remained empty. However, the
country's still does not have a permanent finance minister. Mikhail
Zadornov, the finance minister in the previous government, has
continued as a caretaker.
	   Meanwhile, Primakov said Friday that his government would try to
clean up the criminal activity that is pervasive in the country's
unregulated ``shadow economy.''
	   ``Whether we can build a market economy of a civilized type ...
depends on whether we are able to achieve an improvement in
fighting the shadow economy and economic crime,'' Primakov was
quoted as saying by Russian news agencies.

Seles: Not as much respect among younger players
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS `Saturday' to `Friday' in 12th graf &QL;

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Monica Seles notices two differences in women's
tennis since her start on the tour at age 14: the teen-age players
now have the physical capabilities of 20-year-olds, and there is
less respect toward the veterans.
	   ``It doesn't matter to me,'' she said Friday in response to a
question. ``Each has been very fair to me.
	   ``With some, I don't agree with the way their attitude is,'' she
said, but added, ``I talk to most of the young players. I get along
very well.''
	   Seles, now 24, didn't cite any examples.
	   She said she still felt an obligation to show respect to past
champions such as Billie Jean King and Martina Navratilova, and
current veterans including Steffi Graf and Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario.
	   But on court, ``it really doesn't matter who is playing, or how
old they are. I just worry about what I can control. It doesn't
give me more or less motivation,'' said the former No. 1, now
ranked sixth by the WTA.
	   The 26-year-old Sanchez-Vicario agreed that the atmosphere
``definitely has changed'' since her start 13 years ago.
	   ``When I started on the tour, the young players had an idol. You
say hello. There is big respect for what they have done. Now it's
different. It doesn't happen as much.''
	   But in the end, she said, ``you have to go to the court'' to
decide the winners.
	   Anna Kournikova, the 17-year-old Russian poster girl for the
current Toyota Princess Cup tournament, said of the respect issue:
``I have never been in the middle of anything like that.
	   ``I have a great friendship with Monica. I'm playing doubles
with her,'' she added. The pair meet top seeds Lisa Raymond and
Rennae Stubbs in Saturday's semifinals.
	   On the court, Kournikova beat Sanchez-Vicario in their first
three meetings, but the veteran Spaniard has won their last two
matches, including a 6-3, 6-2 victory Friday.
	   ``I learned what I did wrong'' the first three times,
Sanchez-Vicario said.

Taiwan notes Chinese cooperation, may back off overseas trips
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Officials said Friday they were encouraged
by China's cooperation in arranging for a major visit there by a
Taiwan statesman that could end a three year stalemate in talks
between the two countries.
	   In a sign that Taipei may be willing to return the sentiment, a
newspaper reported Vice President Lien Chan has postponed two
overseas visits to help improve the atmosphere for negotiations.
	   In just concluded meetings between mid-level officials from the
two nations in Beijing, China seemed to indicate it would take a
more pragmatic approach to negotiations, said Lin Chong-pin, a
deputy secretary general of the cabinet's Mainland Affairs Council.
	   ``We do indeed note flexibility ... and a little bit of surface
friendliness,'' Lin told a news conference.
	   Taiwan's top China negotiator, Koo Chen-fu, is scheduled to
visit his counterpart in China next month for what is being called
an informal get-together.
	   High-level statesmen for the estranged rivals have not met since
1993. China cancelled a planned meeting in 1995 over what it
perceived as Taiwan's drift away from the goal of reunification.
	   Shi Hwei-yow, secretary general of the semiofficial Straits
Exchange Foundation, said Thursday night that he was ``completely
satisfied,'' with his consultations with counterparts in China to
arrange Koo's visit.
	   Koo plans to meet with his Chinese counterpart Wang Daohan in
Shanghai next month. Taiwan hopes the meeting will pave the way for
a resumption of negotiations on forging relations with China.
	   Chairing a meeting of the foundation's board of directors, Koo
said recent developments seemed to offer hope for progress in
relations.
	   The visit ``could be a big step for the future development of
ties between the two sides,'' Koo said.
	   Officials also warned against being overly hopeful.
	   Taiwanese shouldn't put ``too much hope, too much pressure'' on
Koo, Premier Vincent Siew said at the legislature. ``It's a
get-together, not a negotiation,'' Siew said of next month's
scheduled visit.
	   Major differences remain between the two counties. Beijing
insists that formal talks begin with political discussions about
reunification. Taipei wants to start with practical issues such as
fishing disputes.
	   China has claimed Taiwan as a renegade province since the sides
separated amid civil war in 1949, and says the island has no right
to diplomatic recognition.
	   The mass-circulation United Daily News reported Taiwan may be
willing to give slightly on the question of visits. Quoting
unidentified sources, it said Lien passed on invitations to address
the European Parliament in Belgium in July and visit a former
Communist country earlier this month.
	   Lien did not confirm or deny the report, and his spokesman was
unavailable for comment.

Russian legislators warns of war if Turkey blocks Russian missiles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Any attempt by Turkey to prevent the
delivery of Russian anti-aircraft missiles ordered by Cyprus would
result in a Russian-Turkish war, a Russian legislator said Friday.
	   Russia would also rush to the defense of Cyprus if Turkey
attacked the S-300 missiles after their deployment, provided it is
asked for help by Cyprus, said Alexei Arbatov, the deputy chairman
of the Russian Parliament's Defense Committee.
	   ``If Turkey attacked the missiles while they were being
transported to Cyprus, this would immediately mean war with
Russia,'' Arbatov said in an interview with state-run Cyprus
Television.
	   Cyprus maintains the missiles _ expected to be delivered later
this year _ are a necessary defense against Turkish air attacks
that could come should tensions increase over Cyprus, which is
divided into Greek-Cypriot and Turkish-Cypriot sectors.
	   Turkey has threatened to stop delivery of the missiles, and the
United States and European nations have urged Cyprus to cancel the
order for the missiles in fear their arrival could increase
tensions.
	   Arbatov said Russia could only come to the aid of Cyprus if the
two countries had a joint defense agreement. ``But if Cyprus asked
for this, the Duma (parliament) could ratify a defense treaty in a
day,'' he added.
	   The Russian lawmaker charged that the United States is opposed
to the missile deployment ``because they don't want Russia to
compete with American arms sales ... and don't want Russians to
acquire greater political presence in the Eastern Mediterranean.''
	   Greece, which has a joint defense agreement with Cyprus, said it
will support Cyprus if it is attacked, a development that would
involve it in a war with fellow NATO ally Turkey.
	   Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz repeated Turkey's warning
over the missiles Thursday before the United Nations General
Assembly in New York. He said the deployment of the missiles would
turn the standoff on the island into a regional conflict.
	   Cyprus has been divided into the two zones since Turkey invaded
the island in 1974 after a coup by supporters of union with Greece.
A breakaway Turkish Cypriot state established in the north is only
recognized by Turkey, which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides said he will cancel the
missile deployment if there is progress in talks on reunifying the
island or if Turkey agrees to halt overflights or accepts proposals
for demilitarizing Cyprus.

Belgian interior minister offers resignation over death of

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The death of a Nigerian woman who had
become a symbol for opponents of Belgium's asylum policy plunged
the government into crisis Friday after the interior minister
offered to resign over police mishandling of the case.
	   The fate of Socialist minister Louis Tobback hung in the balance
since King Albert II still had not made a decision whether to
accept his resignation. The center-left coalition had been trying
to keep Tobback, who is also a vice-premier, on the job.
	   ``I hope he can still change his mind. He is very important
within the government,'' said Justice Minister Tony Van Parys, a
Christian Democrat.
	   Tobback's move came after he learned that one of the two
policemen who had tried to subdue Semira Adamu during the
deportation attempt had already been sanctioned by the police force
last year for repeatedly kicking an asylum seeker.
	   Adamu, 20, died in a Brussels hospital late Tuesday from a brain
hemorrhage, hours after police had stuffed a pillow over her mouth
to restrain her on a plane which was about to depart for Africa.
	   Tobback, who is responsible for the police force, said his
resignation offer was based on the fact that ``a policeman who had
been sanctioned for serious offenses against a deportee was allowed
to be within the division and told to carry out this delicate
task.''
	   The police officer in question had been put on non-active for
one month and was not allowed on deportation duty for seven months
after the January 1997 incident.
	   Since he was reintegrated in the service, he was always
supervised and videotaped during deportation operations. Police
spokeswoman Els Cleemput pointed out he was not the man holding the
pillow on Adamu's face.
	   Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene opened the weekly cabinet
meeting without Tobback Friday. King Albert II was on a one-day
visit to Lisbon, Portugal and would only return late Friday. That
time would be used to try to sway Tobback.
	   Tobback's fellow Socialist, Health Minister Marcel Colla, held
out little hope Tobback would change his mind. ``He is very
determined. I'm rather pessimistic.''
	   Tobback was considered a key government minister to push through
a drastic reform of Belgium's embattled police and security
structure.

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Internationally known paleoanthropolgist
and opposition legislator Richard Leakey said Friday he accepted a
presidential appointment for a second stint as director of the
troubled Kenya Wildlife Service for the sake of the country of his
birth.
	   Leakey was forced to quit the same job in 1994 after attacks by
politicians close to President Daniel arap Moi. The president later
described Leakey as ``arrogant and racist'' and not a Kenyan.
	   Leakey is a third-generation Kenyan of British origin. His
grandfather, Harry Leakey, came to Kenya as a missionary in 1902
and settled with his family.
	   ``I believe that I have an obligation to my country, Kenya, and
in the hope that I can, indeed, be helpful at this time, I have
accepted the position of KWS director,'' Leakey told a news
conference.
	   KWS is responsible for the East African nation's wildlife, which
is the mainstay of the country's tourism industry _ the third
single largest earner of foreign currency.
	   Leakey declined to say whether Moi had given him any guarantees
that there would be no political interference with the job this
time around.
	   ``Obviously, one does not knowingly put his head in a noose,''
Leakey said in response to a question. ``I don't think I am doing
that.''
	   He said he will not be compromised and will oppose encroachment
on wildlife sanctuaries by private interests.
	   Describing the KWS as ``broke,'' Leakey said the organization is
likely to have a more than 500 million shilling (about dlrs 8
million) deficit in the financial year ending last June.
	   ``It is quite clear that there is a financial crisis,'' Leakey
said.
	   He said poaching for meat, ivory and other products ``is on the
increase, and the organization charged with taking care of our
wilderness areas is completely broke and cannot do its work.''
	   Leakey said his priorities are to evaluate the crisis, find out
how much of it is due to poor planning, poor management, theft or
graft and ``put that right, and once we can operate ask other
questions.''
	   He said he will also deal with the insecurity from bandits and
armed bands that threaten tourists in the game reserves.
	   ``Nobody can market a beautiful place if the safety of the
customer is in any doubt,'' Leakey said.
	   There were numerous attacks on tourists during David Western's
four-year tenure as KWS director.
	   Leakey's appointment had been rumored following Western's
dismissal last week.
	   Leakey said he was sure Moi would put behind their past
acrimony.
	   Moi made no secret of his dislike of Leakey after he left KWS,
and the president made every effort to block the registration of
the opposition Safina party.
	   Leakey was instrumental in founding Safina after Kenya's return
to multiparty politics in 1992.
	   Under a system that allows parties to nominate legislators based
on the number of seats they have won in a general election, Leakey
was named to parliament for Safina after last December's elections.
	   Leakey said he will remain a member of parliament but would
reconsider his situation should legislative matters hamper his work
as KWS director.
	   During his previous service at KWS and as head of the National
Museums of Kenya _ founded by his father Louis B. Leakey _ Leakey
was known as a skilled international fundraiser.

New government should restore stargazers' funding, astronomers say
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Australia-Election &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Astronomers Friday urged the winner
of Australia's Oct. 3 election to restore funding to programs to
spot falling meteors, comets or asteroids.
	   The program was cut in 1996, leaving the southern hemisphere
without an organized program to search for earth-threatening
objects, said Peter Anderson, president of the Astronomical
Association of Queensland state.
	   The northern hemisphere has such programs, but their
effectiveness was diminished by the absence of a southern program,
he said.
	   ``This cessation of funding has caused a major deficiency in our
ability to identify and predict these threats,'' Anderson said.
	   ``Much of the increasing northern hemisphere efforts could also
be wasted because of the limited follow-up once objects move into
southern skies,'' he said.
	   Anderson proposed an Australian dollars 300,000 (U.S. dlrs
175,000) program involving an existing automated patrol telescope
at the University of New South Wales.
	   Michael Paine, a spokesman for the Planetary Society, said the
government and private sector should take seriously the threat of
devastating tidal waves caused by an offshore meteor strike.
	   He said the recent Papua New Guinea tsunami showed how
destructive these waves could be.
	   ``Recent studies on the effects of ocean impacts by asteroids
and comets as small as 50 meters (yard) across showed that coastal
dwellings were vulnerable,'' he said.
	   Paine said research conducted at the University of Wollongong
found evidence that New South Wales state had been struck by at
least five giant tsunamis in the past 7,000 years with waves up to
100 meters (yards) high penetrating 6 miles (10 kilometers) inland.

	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ An unlikely opposition alliance
ranging from rightists to Greens entered Slovakia's nationwide
elections with high hopes Friday, intent on unseating a hard-line
government that has alienated its central European neighbors.
	   The two-day balloting runs from Friday afternoon to Saturday
afternoon. But opposition leaders said most voters would wait until
the second day due to fears of vote-count fraud.
	   International human rights groups also have expressed concern of
possible election manipulation by the government, which last year
canceled a key ballot question on the eve of a referendum that
could have challenged its authoritarian grip on power.
	   Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar and his nationalist Movement for
a Democratic Slovakia have ruled largely uninterrupted and
unchallenged since the country broke from Czechoslovakia and became
independent in 1993.
	   But opposition forces with little in common except a dislike of
the hard-line policies of ``Meciarism'' stand a good chance of
taking power if they stay united beyond the balloting.
	   Meciar's HZDS, as it is widely known, has powerful backers in
the state media and in privatized industries and is favored to get
the most votes of the 17 parties competing for the 150 seats in
Parliament. But analysts say its prospects for finding enough
allies to forge a majority coalition are bleak because of dwindling
support.
	   Of the six parties expected to receive the minimum 5 percent
required to earn seats in parliament, only the far-right Slovak
National Party, Meciar's main coalition partner in the current
government, has expressed willingness to work with him. But that
party is not expected to win many seats.
	   Standing ready to try to take over is a rejuvenated opposition,
led by a recently formed five-party alliance _ the Slovak
Democratic Coalition _ that includes Christian conservatives,
social free-marketeers and Greens.
	   ``We will stick together,'' coalition leader Mikulas Dzurinda
pledged on the eve of the vote ``If there are problems, we are
going to stay together, because we will always remember the bad
times under Meciar.''

Sri Lankan government troops kill eight Tamil rebels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lankan government troops killed
eight Tamil Tiger guerrillas in three clashes in the northeastern
war zones, the military said Friday.
	   There were no casualties among government troops, said Maj.
Kumar Dewage, a military spokesman. The rebels did not immediately
comment on the incidents.
	   Five rebels were killed Thursday by army snipers in the forests
around the northern town of Mankulam, Dewage said.
	   He said two other rebels were killed Thursday in a military
ambush near the town of Vakarai in the eastern Batticaloa district.
	   Another guerrilla was killed on Wednesday when he was spotted by
soldiers on patrol while trying to infiltrate the government-held
northern Jaffna Peninsula, Dewage said.
	   Many of Sri Lanka's 3.3 million Tamils, who make up 18 percent
of the population, accuse the ruling Sinhalese of discrimination.
The rebels are fighting for a homeland in the north and east, where
Tamils predominate. More than 54,000 people have been killed in the
war which began in 1983.

Ceausescu children get parents' death certificates
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS comment from defense ministry.

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The children of Romania's last
Communist dictator have received their parents' death certificates,
nearly a decade after he and his wife were executed, a newspaper
reported Friday.
	   The documents were drawn up by the defense ministry after Zoe
Ceausescu, daughter of Nicolae and Elena Ceausescu, initiated a
lawsuit against it in May, following an eight-year battle to get
the certificates, reported Curierul National.
	   The Ceausescus' 25 years of harsh rule ended when they were shot
to death on Christmas Day 1989, after a summary trial in the city
of Targoviste, some 80 kilometers (50 miles) northwest of
Bucharest.
	   The Ceausescus were accused of genocide and undermining the
national economy. Some 1,000 people died during the 1989
anti-communist uprising as forces loyal to Ceausescu battled with
street protesters.
	   The certificates were handed out by Bucharest municipal
authorities but drawn up by the defense ministry, said Lilian
Zamfiroiu of the defense ministry press office. The Ceausescus were
tried by a military court and shot by a firing squad of soldiers.
	   Because they were released in Bucharest and not the Ceausescus'
place of death, the certificates are not legally valid, private
news agency Mediafax reported.
	   Ceausescu son Valentin has complained that authorities ignored
the family's request for the death certificates and the return of
the family goods.
	   But Zamfiroiu said the defense ministry had received no requests
to release the certificates since the Ceausescus died. He claimed
the timing of the lawsuit and its handing over of certificates were
``coincidental.''
	   The circumstances of the Ceausescus' execution and the way the
post-revolutionary government of second-level communists took over
remains a matter of controversy in Romania.

Opposition-ran Rijeka chooses Tudjman critic as theater manager
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIJEKA, Croatia (AP) _ An outspoken critic of Croatia's
president was elected manager of the main theater in Rijeka, itself
run by the political opposition, a daily reported Friday.
	   The Rijeka-based Novi list said the appointment of Slobodan
Snajder came after the Social Democrats and other parties outvoted
the party of Croatian President Franjo Tudjman at a municipal
council meeting.
	   Snajder has spent much of his time in Austria and Germany in
recent years and has often criticized Tudjman's government as
nationalistic and conservative in commentaries published by Novi
list.
	   Snajder's election has yet to be confirmed by the minister of
culture, a member of Tudjman's party.
	   Snajder pledged that as the manager of the Rijeka theater, one
of Croatia's biggest, he would not retaliate against those who have
blocked his plays from being performed in the country in recent
years.

Report: police told to go easy on Jewish settlers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A new set of secret instructions orders Israeli
security forces not to use live bullets or steel-coated rubber
pellets to disperse protests by Jewish settlers in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   Israeli security forces routinely use rubber bullets and
sometimes live ammunition to break up riots by Palestinian
stone-throwers.
	   Etty Eshed, spokeswoman of the Israeli Justice Ministry, said
there is a set of instructions for dealing with all rioters,
Israeli and Palestinians alike. She confirmed that there is a
secret annex, but did not give details.
	   Maariv quoted from the secret annex written by Attorney General
Elyakim Rubinstein. It said the security forces must take into
account that the settlers face increasingly difficult conditions in
the West Bank and Gaza, because of their ``uncertain security
situation.''
	   Rubinstein instructed Israeli police only to use water cannons
and tear gas to break up settler protests.
	   The report also warns of settler reprisals against Palestinians
after Palestinian attacks, including arson, damaging vehicles, and
firing at rooftop water tanks.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   TOKYO (AP) _ As they have many times before, Asian stock markets
followed the lead of Wall Street on Friday, and used profit-taking
to whittle away at big gains from the day before. In Japan, the
benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 481.94 points, or
3.39 percent, to close at 13,723.84 points. Analysts said Tokyo was
reacting to the Dow Jones industrial average, which closed 1.9
percent lower Thursday and to concern over the multibillion-dollar
bailout of a top U.S. hedge fund. The U.S. dollar also tumbled
against the yen, falling 2.16 yen to 134.64 yen in late afternoon
trading. In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index was down 133
points, or 1.7 percent, to 7701.61 on Friday. Singapore stocks fell
as well, with investors taking profits after Thursday's robust
gains. The bellwether Straits Times Index fell 8.06 points, or 0.86
percent, on Friday to 923.92. (WORLD MARKETS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Despite Russia's pleas for cash, an International
Monetary Fund team wrapped up a visit Friday without recommending
that Moscow receive the next installment on a dlrs 22.6 billion
loan package. Russia wants the money to help stabilize an economy
wracked by surging inflation, rising unemployment and a falling
currency. But the IMF team left without agreeing to release
additional money and will return for further negotiations on Oct.
12, the Interfax news agency reported. Russia has been hoping for
another dlrs 4.3 billion from the IMF by the end of September. But
the IMF has indicated that it doesn't intend to release more money
to Russia until it's satisfied that the country has sound economic
policies in place. In another development, a plan to pay out money
to Russians from their frozen bank accounts won't begin until Nov.
30, two weeks later than previously planned, news reports said.
Russia's new government is trying to bail out the country's
troubled commercial banks, which have been largely paralyzed by the
economic crisis. Most major banks are either closed or have been
conducting only limited transactions. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Ex-President Suharto authorizes
investigators Friday to search for and seize any money he may have
siphoned from the government's coffers and stashed overseas.
Attorney General Andi Muhammad Ghalib said Suharto's six wealthy
children would also be examined soon, and he rejected claims by
critics that his inquiry was too weak and too slow. ``People should
wait patiently for the results,'' he said adding that it had taken
years for the Philippines to recover money taken by former dictator
Ferdinand Marcos. Suharto is widely accused of making billions from
corruption during his three decades in power, while his family
built huge business empires under his patronage.
(INDONESIA-SUHARTO)
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil's pledge to adopt austerity
measures in an effort to break its headlong dash to economic chaos
has received high marks overseas, but is greeted with skepticism at
home. On Wednesday, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said his
government planned to tackle the economy's weak spot _ a budget
deficit equal to 7.3 percent of gross domestic product _ and hinted
that taxes would be increased. U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
praised Cardoso's speech, and Enrique Iglesias, president of the
Interamerican Development Bank, said the speech was ``an excellent
message to the international financial community.'' But many
Brazilian businessmen fear that any increase in taxes would only
make matters worse, cutting consumer spending and encouraging the
black market. The turmoil in world financial markets has led to a
strong outflow of capital, and Brazil's foreign reserves have
fallen below dlrs 50 billion from the dlrs 70 billion in two
months. To prevent a collapse of Brazil's currency, the real, and
stem capital flight, the government on Sept. 10 raised interest
rates from 30 percent to 50 percent. (BRAZIL-ECONOMY)
	   GENEVA (AP) _ As EU called for a comprehensive new round of
trade talks, the United States joined India and other developing
nations at the World Trade Organization in urging caution. Peter
Carl of the 15-nation European Union said Thursday that a new round
should tackle new areas, such as the creation of new international
rules for competition and investment, as well as traditional topics
of services and agriculture. The meeting is the first of a series
held to prepare for new trade negotiations due to begin next year.
However, U.S. Trade Representative Rita Hayes said new issues need
to be ``carefully considered'' before being put on the agenda. She
argued for a gradual approach, saying negotiators should be able to
tear down barriers in individual areas without waiting for
agreement on all issues. India and other developing countries have
been wary of talk of a comprehensive round, arguing they should be
given breathing space first to sort out problems and enforce
existing trade accords. (TRADE-NEGOTIATIONS)

Spanish airliner crashes in Morocco killing 38
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with officials confirming no survivors; 18 bodies
recovered, CHANGES overline; ADDS quote from government official &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A Spanish airliner crashed into a hill in
Morocco on Friday, killing all 38 people aboard.
	   Rescue workers have recovered 18 bodies so far, the state news
agency Efe said, quoting sources in the regional government in
Melilla, a tiny Spanish enclave on Morocco's Mediterranean coast.
	   The plane, with 34 passengers and four crew, was headed to
Melilla from the southern Spanish port of Malaga when it went down
in Moroccan territory about 20 kilometers (12 miles) from Melilla
as it approached for landing.
	   Visibility at Melilla airport was said to be poor.
	   Most of the passengers were Spanish military personnel stationed
in the enclave, according to national radio.
	   ``It appears the plane crashed into a hilltop and broke into
pieces,'' said Melilla regional government chief, Enrique Palacios.
	   The 86-seat plane, a British-built BAE 146, belonged to a
Spanish charter airline called Pauknair.
	   The wreckage was spotted by a Spanish air force plane as part of
a rescue mission that included helicopters and ships.
	   Sources close to Pauknair in Morocco said the last radio contact
with the plane was made at 8:55 a.m. (0655 GMT) from Melilla.
	   The plane left Malaga at 8:15 a.m. and crashed in an area of
rugged terrain called Cap des Trois Fourches. The sources spoke on
condition they not be named.

Taliban says U.S. pushing Iran toward war with Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The militia that controls most of
Afghanistan accused the United States on Friday of conspiring to
push Iran into war with Afghanistan.
	   ``America wants Iran to attack Afghanistan ... but Iran should
refrain from this foolishness,'' Jalaluddin Haqqani, the Taliban
minister for Border and Tribal Affairs told a news conference.
	   If Iran invades, the United States will ensure its troops never
get out, he said.
	   Iran, a powerful western neighbor of Afghanistan, has deployed
roughly 200,000 troops on the border after the killing of eight
Iranian diplomats and a journalist by Taliban fighters when it
captured the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif in early August.
	   Tehran is demanding an apology from the Taliban, the handing
over of the killers and an immediate release of an estimated 40
Iranians.
	   The Taliban blames renegade fighters for the killings, but has
refused to hand the killers over, saying they will punish them
themselves.
	   Iran's ambassador to Pakistan, Mohammed Mehdi Akhoundzadeh, said
Thursday the barbaric act must be punished.
	   Haqqani said the killed Iranians were spies and not diplomats.
	   The Taliban, who are Sunni Muslims, follow a strict versions of
Islam that bars women from work and education and forces men to
wear beards.
	   Iran, a Shiite Muslim country, accuses the Taliban of targeting
Afghanistan's minority Shiite Muslims, who belong to an
anti-Taliban alliance that is trying to stop the Taliban from
consolidating its hold on the country.
	   The Taliban currently rule 90 percent of the country.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ After weeks of barnstorming across Germany
ahead of Sunday's parliamentary election, Chancellor Helmut Kohl
and challenger Gerhard Schroeder were taking it easy on the eve of
the vote.
	   Neither candidate had anything on his appointment calendar for
Saturday, campaign officials said.
	   On Sunday, Kohl planned to go to church in his hometown of
Oggersheim, then vote before flying by helicopter to Bonn to await
the election results.
	   Schroeder, governor of Lower Saxony state, votes in the state
capital of Hanover Sunday morning, then also heads to Bonn.
	   Greens leader Gunda Roestel had a final campaign rally in the
eastern city of Chemnitz on Saturday, then planned to spend the
evening in the sauna.

Report: police told to go easy on Jewish settlers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A new set of secret instructions orders Israeli
security forces not to use live bullets or steel-coated rubber
pellets to disperse protests by Jewish settlers in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   Israeli security forces routinely use rubber bullets and
sometimes live ammunition to break up riots by Palestinian
stone-throwers.
	   Etty Eshed, spokeswoman for the Israeli Justice Ministry, said
there is a set of instructions for dealing with all rioters,
Israeli and Palestinians alike. She confirmed that there is a
secret annex, but did not give details.
	   Maariv quoted from the secret annex written by Attorney General
Elyakim Rubinstein. It said the security forces must take into
account that the settlers face increasingly difficult conditions in
the West Bank and Gaza, because of their ``uncertain security
situation.''
	   Rubinstein instructed Israeli police only to use water cannons
and tear gas to break up settler protests.
	   The report also warns of settler reprisals against Palestinians
after Palestinian attacks, including arson, damaging vehicles, and
firing at rooftop water tanks.

<TEXT>
	   JAMMU, India (AP) _ Suspected mercenary guerrillas stormed a
house in a mountainous village in India's violence-plagued
Jammu-Kashmir state and killed three Muslim men by slitting their
throats, police said Friday.
	   The militants entered the house in the state's Arai village
early Thursday and killed the three men _ all under 20 years old _
senior police official K. Rajendra told The Associated Press.
	   Rajendra said foreign mercenaries were suspected.
	   He did not give details, but Indian security officials say
Afghan mercenaries are crowding the ranks of the dozens of militant
groups fighting in the troubled province for independence from
India or a merger with Pakistan.
	   Local sources said the militants suspected the three youths were
police informers.
	   The territory of Kashmir _ which has provoked two wars between
India and Pakistan _ is divided between the two nations with both
sides claiming the whole territory.

Singapore Airlines to sign alliance with Scandinavian Airline
</HEADLINE>
System
 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES material from Britain-Airline Alliance &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore Airlines said Friday that it will
sign a code-sharing agreement with Scandinavian Airline System, the
latest deal in an increasingly consolidating airline industry.
	   The airline said in a statement that details for the partnership
are being worked out. No date was given for the agreement, which
would pool the two airlines' resources and allow them to share
routes and flights.
	   Executives from SAS said the partnership could pave the way for
Singapore Airlines to enter the Star alliance, which includes six
major carriers, the Financial Times reported earlier.
	   But Singapore Airlines has ``not made any decision on whether to
join Star alliance,'' according to the statement from Singapore's
highly profitable, government-linked carrier.
	   The Star alliance groups U.S.-based United Airlines, SAS,
Germany's Lufthansa, Brazil's Varig, Air Canada, and Thai Airlines.
	   ``We could manage 10 carriers within Star,'' the Financial Times
quoted SAS chief executive Jan Stenberg as saying.
	   Such tie-ups are the latest trend in international commercial
aviation, where growth has been strong, notwithstanding economic
problems in Asia.
	   Airlines are increasingly turning to these alliances, which
offer greater resources and profit for individual carriers too
small to offer services across the entire globe.
	   Stenberg confirmed that Singapore Airlines had no immediate
plans to join the alliance, although it remains an option for the
future, reported the London-based newspaper.
	   Although the Singapore flagship has been hurt by the Asian
economic crisis, it has remained Asia's most profitable airline and
has sought to invest in and form partnerships with other carriers.
	   SIA has recently secured deals that include code-sharing with
Lufthansa and Taiwan's China Airlines, and has been eying a share
of newly defunct Philippines Airlines.
	   The link between SAS and Singapore Airlines follows the launch
earlier this week of the ``oneworld'' alliance involving British
Airways, American Airlines, Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific, Australia's
Qantas and Canadian Airlines.
	   Seen as a rival to Star, the ``oneworld'' airlines say they will
coordinate their flight schedules and ticketing, while cooperating
on their frequent flier programs beginning early next year.
	   Vagn Sorensen, the SAS director responsible for alliances, was
quoted by the Financial Times as saying that the Star carriers were
exploring associate membership for smaller airlines and that SAS
was in talks with All Nippon Airways, Japan's second largest
airline, about possible participation.

Fifth rugby league player tests positive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A fifth National Rugby League player
has tested positive to drug use, the announcement coming just two
days away from the league's grand final championship.
	   With Brisbane and Canterbury players counting down to the
premiership decider Sunday at Sydney Football Stadium, the NRL was
forced to announce Friday that the player had tested positive for
performance-enhancing drugs.
	   NRL officials declined to comment on the matter but issued a
statement late Friday advising it has received formal notification
of the result from the Australian Sports Drug Agency.
	   The player, whose name is known, is not a regular first grader
and has not played for several months due to injury. His club was
not involved in the 10-team playoff, the league said.
	   The NRL will arrange a hearing as soon as possible and if he
tested positive after June 19, the player _ in his first season
with a Sydney-based club _ could be the first to face a mandatory
two-year ban.
	   Although he had been sidelined before then, it is likely the
result came from the NRL's blanket testing of all players after
that date following a positive test by Newcastle fullback Robbie
O'Davis.
	   O'Davis, Melbourne prop Rodney Howe and Knights forward Wayne
Richards all received 22-match suspensions under the ARL's more
lenient drugs penalty for players returning positive samples from
tests before round 14.
	   Newcastle winger Adam MacDougall, already serving an 11-match
drugs ban for amphetamines, would also only be liable for the
lesser penalty if a third and final round of testing confirms
irregular epitestosterone levels.
	   NRL officials said a number of players will be targeted by
Australian drug agency after Sunday's grand final.

Sheffield United chairman urges FIFA to punish Lisbon's Benfica
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The chairman of England's first division
club Sheffield United called on FIFA to punish Lisbon club Benfica
for not paying the transfer fee on striker Brian Deane, news
reports said Friday.
	   ``I demand that FIFA (soccer's world governing body) take strong
action against Benfica, such as expel them from the Champions
League,'' Mike McDonald told the Lisbon soccer daily Record.
	   The cash-strapped Lisbon club signed a 2 and 1/2 year contract
with the 30-year-old former England international in January for an
undisclosed amount of money.
	   ``We will sue Benfica. It is not proper for a club to sign up a
player and not pay for him,'' the paper quoted McDonald as saying.
	   Last season, Benfica _ currently leading Portugal's first
division along with FC Porto _ amounted a deficit of some dlrs 9.4
million, according to the daily.
	   The club still owes English club Manchester United the
outstanding sum, believed to be about dlrs 3 million, on Czech
player Karel Poborsky, signed last season.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A plane carrying 38 people crashed Friday
into a Morrocan hillside while flying from the southern Spanish
port of Malaga to North Africa, a state news agency said.
	   Spanish state radio quoted unnamed Moroccan officials as saying
there were no survivors. The report could not be independently
confirmed.
	   The 86-seat plane, a British-built BAE 146, belonged to a
Spanish charter airline called Pauknair, the state news agency EFE
said.
	   The plane was carrying 34 passengers and a crew of four from
Malaga to Melilla, a tiny Spanish enclave located on the
Mediterranean coast of Morocco.
	   State radio said the plane was preparing to land when it crashed
about 12 miles (19 kilometers) from Melilla. Visibility at Melilla
airport was poor, the news agency said.
	   The wreckage in a rugged area called Cap des Trois Fourches was
spotted by a Spanish air force plane as part of a rescue mission
that included helicopters and ships.
	   Spanish radio said most of the passengers were Spanish Civil
Guards stationed in Melilla.

Poll finds support for returning Elgin Marbles to Greece
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A plurality of Britons would support the return of
the Elgin Marbles to Greece, according to an opinion poll published
Friday which also discovered substantial apathy about the issue.
	   The Elgin Marbles are sculptures taken mainly from the Parthenon
in 1812 and now kept at the British Museum. The Greek government
has pressed for their return for many years.
	   The polling organization MORI asked 1,823 adults how they would
vote if there were a referendum of returning the sculptures.
Thirty-nine percent said they would vote yes, 15 percent would vote
to keep them in Britain, but 28 percent were undecided and a
further 18 percent said they would not vote.
	   The margin of error was about three percentage points.

U.S. general consulate in Hamburg still on alert for attack
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with consulate open Friday, unrelated threat at U.S.
bases in southwest Germany; ADDS description of consulate building.

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ The U.S. general consulate was under
increased security for a second day Friday after being threatened
with an attack.
	   Dozens of police and several armored personnel carriers guarded
the white, palace-like building, which stands near a tributary of
the Alster river. A consulate employee said the Hamburg offices
were open and there were no plans to close.
	   Police have blocked the road to the consulate, and a police boat
patrolled the waters nearby. Police divers have been checking the
river and air traffic controllers have been instructed to notify
police of any unauthorized flights over the area.
	   The extra security will continue at least until Monday, when
police plan to consider relieving some of the dozens of extra
officers, police spokesman Reinhard Fallack said Friday.
	   He said authorities learned of the threat early this week from a
``first-class source,'' although he has refused to comment on who
investigators believed was planning the attack. No arrests have
been made.
	   In what appeared to be an unrelated incident, police Thursday
arrested a man who called in bomb threats to a U.S. air force base
and nearby U.S. military hospital in southwest Germany.
	   The Ramstein Air Base and Landstuhl Regional Medical Center
increased security after the threats at 8:30 a.m. Thursday. The
caller was arrested within hours and charged with making a hoax. He
confessed to making the threats from his mobile telephone because
he was ``bored'' on the drive to work, said Gert Fischer, a police
spokesman.
	   Security was tightened at U.S. installations worldwide after the
Aug. 7 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   A suspected close associate of Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden,
who is wanted by U.S. officials for those attacks, was arrested
last week by German officials acting on a U.S. warrant, raising
concerns of possible reprisals on German soil.
	   Mamdouh Mahmoud Salim, 40, of Sudan, was arrested on a U.S.
warrant charging him with conspiracy to kill Americans and
conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction.

Turkish foreign minister defends alliance with Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Turkey will not reshape its foreign policy
just to appease Arabs who feel threatened by its military
agreements with Israel, Turkey's foreign minister said in an
interview published Friday.
	   The Turkish-Israeli military cooperation agreements and Turkey's
relations with Israel ``have nothing to do with any alliance or
military agreement, and is not aimed at any country or group of
countries,'' Ismail Cem told the Arabic daily Al-Hayat.
	   Cem's comments came in response to accusations by Arab countries
that the Israeli-Turkish military alliance will undermine stability
in the region. Syria, Iran and Iraq believe that the alliance,
which allows for joint military maneuvers, is directed at them.
	   The cooperation agreements, signed in 1996, include military
maneuvers and defense production accords. Israeli jets will also be
able to train in Turkish air space.
	   Cem told the London-based Al-Hayat that Turkey is attempting to
boost its relations with the Arab world.
	   But he also stressed to Arab critics that ``Turkey does not
accept ... restricting its relations with Israel (just) to appease
the Arab world'' in the same way that it will also not ``limit our
relations and our strategy for boosting our ties to the Arab world
in order to please Israel.''
	   Cem also noted Turkey has been criticized by some Israelis who
object to Turkey trying to improve its ties to Arab states.
	   In the latest deal within the Turkish-Israeli agreements, Israel
radio said Friday that Israel will undertake a three-year, dlrs 70
million project to upgrade 48 Turkish air force F-5 training
planes. Another deal to upgrade 54 Turkish Air Force Phantom jet
fighters has already been signed between the two countries.
	   Turkey and Israel are scheduled to hold naval rescue exercises
in November _ their second joint naval maneuvers. Egypt and Jordan
were invited to participate. Egypt has declined, and Jordan said it
would only come as an observer to observe the exercise in the
Mediterranean.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt, France and Italy have ended five days
of joint naval exercises code named Cleopatra `98 in the
Mediterranean Sea, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported Friday.
	   The maneuvers, staged off the coast of Egypt's port city of
Alexandria, involved simulated attacks on submarines, use of
electronic warfare in naval battles, search and rescue operations,
the use of aircraft to protect convoys and targets on land.
	   Twelve vessels were involved in the exercises, including the
Egyptian destroyer Sharm el-Sheik, the French destroyer Cassard and
the Italian submarine Da Vinci. Egypt also participated with
helicopters and F-16 fighter jets and France with two Mirage 2000
aircraft.
	   The exercises ended Thursday, MENA said.
	   Egypt and France have been staging naval maneuvers every two
years since 1988. They were joined for the first time by Italy in
1996.

PAL chairman Lucio Tan files libel suit against pilots' union,
</HEADLINE>
newspaper

 &UR; By OLIVER TEVES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The majority owner and chairman of
the defunct Philippine Airlines has filed a 100 million peso (dlrs
2.25 million) libel suit against the pilots' union and a Manila
newspaper for an article which quoted the union as saying he
profited from the ailing airline.
	   PAL said the Sept. 22 article in the Philippine Daily Inquirer
``maliciously and falsely'' maligned tycoon Lucio Tan.
	   After 57 years in operation, PAL shut down at midnight Wednesday
after last-minute negotiations with its largest union failed to
achieve agreement on a management proposal to rehabilitate the
airline.
	   The libel suit was filed Thursday with prosecutors, who must
determine whether there is enough evidence to bring the case to
court.
	   The pilots' union had alleged in a news conference that Tan
``treated PAL as his personal cow to be milked dry for his personal
gain.''
	   The newspaper quoted the union and its spokesman, Florendo
Umali, as saying Tan and his other companies earned at least 25
billion pesos (dlrs 560 million) from doing business with PAL.
	   Tan's lawyer charged that the newspaper published its account
with malice because it either knew the allegations were false, or
had disregarded whether they were accurate, a PAL statement said.
	   ``Our defense probably is that it is fair and true reporting,
this is a matter of public interest, and these allegations were
made in a press conference, made in public, and there is
attribution,'' Inquirer Publisher Isagani Yambot said. ``We are not
saying that Tan did bleed the company.''
	   The pilots' union had no immediate comment.
	   The pilots were fired by PAL during a devastating 25-day strike
in June after they ignored a government back-to-work order.
	   In a last-ditch effort to prevent PAL's closure, Tan offered 20
percent of its stock to its employees in exchange for a 10-year
suspension of their collective bargaining agreement. This was
rejected by the ground crew union.
	   Estrada said Friday his cash-strapped government cannot afford
to operate the airline and that Tan had planned to close the
airline as early as a month ago because of mounting losses.
	   ``He was almost in tears because he was losing 45 million pesos
(dlrs 1 million) a day,'' Estrada said.
	   PAL now owes dlrs 2.1 billion to foreign and local creditors.
	   Estrada ordered labor officials Friday to hold three days of
talks with PAL's management and workers to discuss whether the
airline's operations can resume.
	   On Thursday, U.S. authorities seized one of PAL's Boeing
747-400s in Los Angeles in an effort to recover the airline's debts
to the U.S. Export-Import Bank.
	   On Friday, flight attendants trooped to PAL's office at Manila's
airport to return their uniforms.

Indonesia's military denies offensive launched in East Timor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ East Timor's military chief of staff
Friday denied reports that Indonesia's armed forced had launched an
offensive by 20,000 troops in northeast part of the troubled
territory.
	   ``There was not a military offensive in our program here, except
territorial activities such as agricultural and health programs,''
local military officer Lt. Col. Supadi told The Associated Press by
telephone.
	   On Thursday, the Portuguese news agency Lusa quoted unidentified
East Timorese separatist sources as claiming a major offensive had
been mounted against East Timor guerrillas near Baucau and
Manatuto, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of territory's
capital, Dili.
	   Supadi said that tensions between troops and local people had
eased in recent months. He cited one case of both sides taking part
in sports competitions.
	   Indonesia invaded former Portuguese colony in 1975 and annexed
it the following year as part of a 27th of Indonesia's province.
	   The United Nation does not recognize the annexation.
Nevertheless it is now sponsoring peace talks between Indonesia and
Portugal.
	   Indonesia has offered to grant a form of autonomy to East Timor
in return for international recognition of its claim.
	   Supadi denied other claims that Indonesia had increased troops
numbers in East Timor after withdrawing 1,000 combat soldiers last
month.
	   He said 15,000 troops were now stationed in the territory, of
which 10,000 were local East Timorese recruits.

Thorpe sets short-course 400-meter record
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: adds quotes, new details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ Teenage sensation Ian Thorpe on Friday
broke the world record for the men's short-course 400-meter
freestyle at the Australian swimming championships, his second
world mark in two weeks.
	   The 15-year-old, who narrowly missed the 200-meter freestyle
world record at the Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur, held off a
determined Grant Hackett in a time of 3 minutes, 39.82 seconds,
shaving 0.64 seconds off the old short-course record held by New
Zealand's Danyon Loader.
	   It is the second world record of the meet after Matt Dunn swam
the fastest short-course 400-meter individual medley on Thursday.
	   Like Dunn, Thorpe was a member of the 800-meter freestyle relay
team which broke the world record last week at Kuala Lumpur.
	   Hackett could consider himself unlucky to have lost as he went
stroke for stroke with Thorpe for the entire race and also broke
the old record in finishing second.
	   Reigning Olympic 1500-meter champion Kieren Perkins was nine
seconds further back in third place.
	   The record continued a remarkable year for Thorpe. He said after
the swim that he and Hackett could have gone faster.
	   ``For the first 200 meters, we were mucking around a little
bit,'' Thorpe said. ``We were waiting for each other to make a
move, I think.''
	   Thorpe said he knows his golden run must end some time.
	   ``Everyone is going to plateau out, I just hope that it won't be
for quite some time,'' he said. (djp)

Russian money woes delay next cargo shipment to Mir
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's money problems have forced a two-week
delay in sending up the next cargo ship to the Mir space station, a
news report said Friday.
	   The supply ship, which will carry food, water, fuel and New
Year's presents for the crew, was to go up on Oct. 15, but is now
scheduled to lift off around the end of October, said Mikhail
Sinelshchikov of the Russian Space Agency's manned mission program.
	   The Progress cargo ship has been completed and is already at the
launch site, the Baikonur space center in neighboring Kazakhstan,
Sinelshchikov told the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   However, the space agency has not been able to purchase the
Soyuz booster rocket needed to send the cargo ship into orbit, he
said.
	   The Mir's current crew, Russian cosmonauts Gennady Padalka and
Sergei Avdeye, have been on board for six weeks.
	   Money problems have also left the launch date uncertain for next
year's flight that will take the last crew to the Mir.
	   Russian space officials said last week they did not know when
they would be able to send up a three-man crew with cosmonauts from
Russia, France and Slovakia. The launch has been tentatively
scheduled for February.
	   The 12-year-old year Mir is expected to remain in orbit until
about June, when it will be abandoned and allowed to burn up in the
earth's atmosphere.

 &UR; Jospin attends delivery of French aid, visits flood area
 &UR; Eds: Leads throughout to UPDATE with Jospin in Shanghai. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Prime Minister Lionel Jospin of France
met President Jiang Zemin in flood-damaged eastern China on Friday
and then flew to the Chinese business capital to inaugurate a
French-language school program.
	   Jospin began his day in Beijing, where he was on hand for
delivery of two French-made water purification systems donated by
the conglomerate Vivendi to help survivors of catastrophic summer
flooding in China.
	   Then the French prime minister flew to Hefei to meet Jiang, who
was inspecting local recovery efforts after flooding that killed
more than 3,000 people in areas throughout China.
	   The unusual location for such a high-level meeting prompted
speculation that China was slighting Jospin to punish France for
selling high-performance Mirage fighter jets to rival Taiwan in
1992. At the time, Jospin was secretary-general of the then-ruling
French Socialist Party.
	   Chinese officials said no snub was intended, and Jospin said
Taiwan did not come up in talks Thursday with Premier Zhu Rongji
about economic ties, the Asian financial crisis and human rights.
	   On Friday, the official Xinhua News Agency reported that Jospin
thanked Jiang for giving him a chance to see flood-recovery efforts
in Hefei, the capital of Anhui province.
	   Jiang praised the French government for focusing on developing
good relations with China, Xinhua said. Jiang visited France in
1994, and French President Jacques Chirac visited Beijing last May,
when the two governments signed a declaration to develop a
``cross-century partnership.''
	   ``China and France should strengthen discussions and enlarge
understanding and deepen cooperation, in order to build an
equitable and cooperative political and economic new order for the
21st century,'' Xinhua quoted Jiang as saying.
	   In Shanghai, Jospin toured the city's historic waterfront Bund
and attended a reception for French residents of Shanghai. France
controlled a section of the city from the late 19th century until
World War II, leaving a legacy in European-style architecture and
public parks.
	   He was to be the guest later at a banquet given by Mayor Xu
Kuangdi, whose administration is aggressively promoting Shanghai as
a center for international investment.
	   On Saturday, Jospin planned to take part in ceremonies to launch
a French-language program at a public school in Pudong, a newly
developed district of eastern Shanghai being promoted as a
financial center.
	   Later in the day, he is scheduled to leave for Hong Kong.
	   Chinese-French relations have improved steadily since their rift
over the Mirage sales to Taiwan.
	   French and Chinese officials signed agreements Thursday on
developing information technology, protecting copyrights, patents
and trademarks and increasing financial cooperation.
	   During Jospin's visit, French businesses signed 14 agreements
worth 2.8 billion yuan (dlrs 339 million or 1.9 billion francs).

Rugova's closest aide seriously wounded in attack
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with ethnic Albanian field reports
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A close aide of Kosovo's ethnic
Albanian leader has been shot and seriously wounded, in what could
be a warning to pacifist Ibrahim Rugova to demand nothing less than
independence for Kosovo from Serbia.
	   Sabri Hamiti was attacked late Thursday in front of his house in
a Pristina suburb, sources close to Rugova said Friday. Two bullets
ended up just above his heart and one broke his arm. Hamiti was
taken to Pristina hospital.
	   Hamiti, 50, is believed to be the closest aide of Rugova. The
main ethnic Albanian political leader in Kosovo, Rugova has showed
readiness to negotiate an agreement for the Serbian province which
falls short of independence.
	   At a press conference Friday, a visibly shaken Rugova said
``this was an attack on Kosovo institutions and prominent public
figures, not only in Kosovo, but in the whole region.''
	   He said the attack ``only further destabilizes the situation in
Kosovo and the whole region.''
	   It was not clear who shot at Hamiti. The attack came only days
after another Rugova aide, the ``defense minister'' in the ethnic
Albanian self-proclaimed government in Kosovo, Ahmet Krasniqi, was
shot and killed in neighboring Albania.
	   The attack on Hamiti may present a warning to Rugova by more
radical factions among ethnic Albanians who reject any deal with
the government of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Most ethnic Albanians in Kosovo want independence. Kosovo is
part of Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   Serbia and the West rule out independence for Kosovo. There have
been signs that Rugova and Milosevic could sign a U.S.-backed
agreement that would give Kosovo a degree of self-rule but would
leave it part of Serbia and within Yugoslavia.
	   Rugova faces opposition over such a deal from the rebel ethnic
Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which has been fighting for
independence for Kosovo. The rebels have pledged to ``punish''
anyone who gives up that goal.
	   But the militants, who had control over some 40 percent of
Kosovo half a year ago, have been largely defeated by Serbian
police and the Yugoslav army after seven months of fighting.
	   Serb sources in Pristina said Friday that the government forces
had ended the latest offensive in the Cicavica mountain, northwest
of the capital Pristina, and rooted out the rebels. A mop-up
operation was underway, they said, indicating lower-level fighting
was continuing.
	   But ethnic Albanian reports said fighting continued in the
central Drenica region.
	   An ethnic Albanian human rights group claimed Serb forces killed
seven men Thursday evening. The same source said Serbs were
separating Albanian men and detaining them.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources also claimed that 30,000 refugees _
mostly women, children and elderly, many of them wounded _ were
concentrated in the village of Brusnik, on the eastern side of the
Cicavica mountain.

U.S. to scale back embassy operations in Tajikistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The United States is scaling back diplomatic
activities and may temporarily close its embassy in the Central
Asian nation of Tajikistan because of the concerns about terrorism,
an embassy official said Friday.
	   A final decision is expected soon, based on an international
reassessment of embassy security in response to the recent bombings
of U.S. embassies in Africa, the official said by telephone from
the embassy in Dushanbe, the Tajik capital. She spoke only on
condition of anonymity.
	   The embassy is located in a hotel in central Dushanbe.
Tajikistan has been torn by violence between the government and its
political opposition, with fighting reaching the outskirts of the
capital on occasion.
	   Tajikistan also is adjacent to Afghanistan, which the United
States has accused of harboring Osama bin Laden, the man suspected
of masterminding the bombings at the U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania.
	   Russian news agencies reported that the United States had
decided to suspend operations at the embassy, while a skeleton
staff continues operations from the U.S. ambassador's residence.
	   The embassy official said that was one proposal, but that the
plans were not final.
	   Some local staffers at the embassy said they had been asked to
seek new jobs. The embassy official said that was ``absolutely
untrue.''
	   She said there are fewer than 10 Americans assigned to the
embassy, with a local staff of about 40. She said some of the
Americans are expected to leave, with the local staff continuing to
carry out embassy operations.
	   Asked when the embassy expected to resume normal operations, she
said, ``When there's a safe place to work.''

Moroccan hillside, killing all 38 people aboard.
	   Rescue workers have recovered 18 bodies so far, the state news
agency Efe said, quoting sources in the regional government in
Melilla, a tiny Spanish enclave on Morocco's Mediterranean coast.
	   The plane, with 34 passengers and four crew, was headed to
Melilla from the southern Spanish port of Malaga when it went down
in Moroccan territory about 20 kilometers (12 miles) from Melilla
as it approached for landing.
	   Visibility at Melilla airport was poor.
	   Most of the passengers were Spanish military personnel stationed
in the enclave, according to national radio.
	   ``It appears the plane crashed into a hilltop and broke into
pieces,'' said Melilla regional government chief, Enrique Palacios.
	   The 86-seat plane, a British-built BAE 146, belonged to a
Spanish charter airline called Pauknair.
	   The wreckage was spotted by a Spanish air force plane as part of
a rescue mission that included helicopters and ships.
	   The plane left Malaga at 8:15 a.m. (0615 GMT) and crashed in an
area of rugged terrain called Cap des Trois Fourches.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Riot police chased thousands of
people out of Kuala Lumpur's main mosque after Muslim prayers
Friday turned into a rally for Malaysia's jailed pro-democracy
leader.
	   Braving the threat of arrest under Malaysia's tough security
law, thousands of people shouted slogans against Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad and unfurled banners that said: ``Mahathir is
cruel.''
	   Friday's protest was the latest of a series this week sparked by
the firing of deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim on Sept. 2 and
his subsequent arrest on Sunday.
	   Arrests of dozens of Anwar's supporters and stern warnings by
the police have frightened his wife into silence but have failed to
quell public sentiment.
	   Within minutes of prayers ending, an Anwar supporter began
addressing the 10,000-strong crowd through a megaphone from a
balcony as others tossed photocopied pictures of Anwar into the
crowd below.
	   ``We call for all ISA political detainees to be released,'' he
said, referring to the Internal Security Act. He also called for
Mahathir's resignation.
	   The crowd responded with a thundering ``Allah O Akbar'' or ``God
is Great.''
	   One engineer in the crowd, who asked not to be named, held a
cell phone toward the speaker so his wife at home could hear the
demonstration.
	   ``Mahathir has done a great job for the country, but this _ what
you see here _ shows the people believe his time is done,'' he
whispered, breaking off to shout: ``Reformasi!''
	   Hundreds of helmeted riot policemen and plain clothed officers
stationed in nearby alleys quickly moved in, banging wooden batons
on their shields.
	   As they stormed through the mosque, many covered their combat
boots with red booties. Others left on their shoes and were chided
by demonstrators, who shouted, ``Shoes! Shoes!'' reminding the
officers of the Muslim custom to leave shoes outside the mosque.
	   There were no immediate reports of any injuries.
	   Anger against the government has been fueled also by the
government's refusal to bring Anwar to court. The police say Anwar
is safe, but have barred his family and his lawyers from seeing
him.
	   Mahathir said Friday that Anwar would be taken to face court
charges once his supporters stifled their protests against his
arrest.
	   ``Tell his followers not to riot, then he will be brought to
court for a trial,'' Mahathir told reporters, adding that Anwar
would be allowed to meet his lawyers when the time is right.
	   Anwar was arrested Sunday hours after he addressed a gathering
at the same mosque and urged his followers to march to nearby
Independence Square in a show of defiance. The crowds at the square
soon swelled to 35,000.
	   Meanwhile, Malaysia faced fresh international criticism for
curbing political rallies and threatening to arrest critics of
Mahathir.
	   ``We are increasingly concerned by the use of the Internal
Security Act to restrict the rights of assembly, free speech, and
open communication in Malaysia,'' a U.S. State Department statement
said.
	   Australian Prime Minister John Howard said he would not back
down from criticism that Malaysia was drifting toward
authoritarianism.
	   Local human rights activists and Malaysia's Bar Council demanded
that Anwar and the 16 others detained along with him be given a
fair trial. The Malaysian Muslim Youth Movement also called on the
authorities to free four of their leaders detained under security
act.
	   The government Thursday said anyone wanting to conduct
``activities'' at the mosque required permission from mosque or
government officials.
	   Anwar's last rally on Sunday was part of a series he held across
the Southeast Asian nation after being dumped as deputy prime
minister and finance minister.
	   Police have threatened Anwar's wife with arrest if she addresses
the public. Officers have blockaded two streets around her home to
keep journalists and supporters away.
	   Anwar has adamantly denied allegations against him, including
unlawful sex acts, disturbing public order, interfering with police
investigations, and leaking state secrets.

Aide complains of growing rifts in Tudjman's party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ President Franjo Tudjman's cabinet chief
accused another close Tudjman aide and the military
counter-intelligence service of leading attacks against him and
other more liberal politicians.
	   Hrvoje Sarinic's interview Friday with the daily Jutarnji list
illustrates the growing rift in Tudjman's ruling party between the
hard-liners, usually characterized as nationalists who oppose
democracy, and moderates, who lean toward organizing Croatia along
Western lines.
	   Sarinic claimed the military counterintelligence unit, known as
SIS, is behind a media campaign against the moderates, and their
actions are likely commanded by Tudjman aide Ivic Pasalic.
	   The dispute flared last week, when Tudjman's adviser for Bosnia,
moderate Franjo Greguric, accused the SIS of using the
sensationalist tabloid Imperijal to tarnish his reputation.
	   Imperijal accused Sarinic and Greguric of accepting bribes and
attempting to lead a putsch.
	   Sarinic said Pasalic, Tudjman's adviser for internal politics,
was behind the reports.
	   He said these actions are aimed at ``publicly satanizing'' him
and other liberals within the Croatian Democratic Union, or HDZ.
	   ``But SIS is only a tool in the hands of one faction within HDZ,
which wants to eliminate from the political scene all those who do
not share their views,'' Sarinic said.
	   ``It is evident that SIS overstepped its authority ... and that
some in HDZ use it to serve their politics.''
	   The conflict between Sarinic and Pasalic, symbolizing the fight
between the two HDZ factions, has simmered for years. It has heated
up as HDZ's popularity fades ahead of next year's parliamentary
elections.
	   The internal battle is seen as a way for the two sides to
position themselves for eventual party control. Tudjman is widely
rumored to be seriously ill.

Palestinian Cabinet endorses right to declare independent state
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 3rd graf to RESTORE dropped word Netanyahu. Edits

 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Heading toward a showdown with Israel, the
Palestinian Cabinet said Yasser Arafat would declare statehood in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip in May.
	   In its decision Thursday night, the Cabinet also hinted that
Arafat would raise the statehood issue when he addresses the U.N.
General Assembly on Monday, despite Israeli warnings that such a
move could sabotage talks on a West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   In a speech to the General Assembly on Thursday, Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that a unilateral declaration of
statehood would lead to the ``complete collapse of the (peace)
process.''
	   Netanyahu said Israel would react harshly, but gave no details.
	   The Palestinian Cabinet, meeting in Gaza City, said Arafat would
declare a state on May 4, 1999 _ the end of the five-year interim
period of autonomy _ with or without Israel's agreement.
	   ``At the end of the interim period, it (the Palestinian
government) shall declare the establishment of a Palestinian state
on all Palestinian land occupied since 1967, with Jerusalem as the
eternal capital of the Palestinian state,'' the Cabinet said in a
statement.
	   Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza and traditionally Arab east
Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war.
	   The statement itself did not mention the May 4 date, meaning
that despite the tough rhetoric, the Palestinians were perhaps
leaving open the possibility of extending the interim period in
case there was progress on talks on a West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   However, the chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, told
reporters after the Cabinet meeting that while the Palestinians
hoped to reach agreement with Israel on the future of the West Bank
and Gaza by May 4, they would declare statehood on that day if no
accord had been concluded.
	   The Cabinet said a future Palestinian state ``will be committed
to the U.N. charter and to international decisions.''
	   In Jerusalem, Israeli Transportation Minister Shaul Yahalom said
Israel should react to a statehood declaration by annexing all
areas of the West Bank and Gaza still under Israeli control.
	   Israel retains full control over one-third of Gaza and 70
percent of the West Bank. Israel and the Palestinians have been
negotiating for months over implementation of an Israeli pledge to
turn over more West Bank land to the Palestinians.
	   In hopes of wrapping up an agreement in the coming days when
both Netanyahu and Arafat are in New York, President Bill Clinton
spoke to the two leaders by phone on Thursday. He is to meet them
separately next week.
	   Officials say there is no plan for a three-way meeting, and an
aide to Netanyahu, Aviv Bushinsky, said Friday the chances of a
Netanyahu-Arafat meeting are ``very slim.''

	   SHIOYA, Japan (AP) _ Craig Parry shot a 4-under-par 68 Friday to
share a one-stroke lead with Eduardo Herrera midway through the 110
million yen (dlrs 818,000) Gene Sarazen Jun Classic.
	   Parry, winner of the Japan Open last year, scored five birdies
against a bogey for an 8-under 136 total. The Australian is a
regular on the U.S. tour.
	   Defending champion and overnight leader Herrera, of Colombia,
shot a 70 with five bidies and three bogeys. He manhandled all four
par-5 holes for birdie.
	   American Todd Hamilton turned in the day's best round of 66 and
was one stroke behind the leaders at 137 along with Carlos Franco
of Paraguay, who went around in 68.
	   Yukio Fukazawa shot a 67 and shared fifth at 138 with Hajime
Meshiai, who carded a 71.
	   Masashi ``Jumbo'' Ozaki, currently heading the money list with
two victories so far this season, posted a 68 and was in a group of
seven sharing 16th at 141.

Kashmir militants slit throats of three Muslims, mine explosion

<TEXT>
	   JAMMU, India (AP) _ Assailants stormed a house in a mountainous
village in India's insurgency-wracked Jammu-Kashmir state and slit
the throats of three Muslim men, police said Friday.
	   The militants entered the house in the state's Arai village
early Thursday and killed the three men _ all under 20 years _
senior police official K. Rajendra told The Associated Press.
	   Rajendra said foreign mercenaries were suspected. He did not
give details, but Indian security officials say Afghan mercenaries
are crowding the ranks of the dozens of militant groups fighting in
the troubled province for independence from India or a merger with
neighboring Pakistan.
	   Local sources said the militants suspected the three youth were
police informers.
	   India regularly accuses Pakistan of training and arming
insurgents who began their rebellion in 1989. Pakistan says it only
gives moral support to the separatist movement in predominately
Hindu India's only Muslim-majority state. Pakistan is officially
Muslim.
	   The territory of Kashmir _ which has provoked two wars between
India and Pakistan _ is divided between the two nations with both
sides claiming the whole territory.
	   Elsewhere in Kashmir, a mine explosion in the northern town of
Pattan killed two paramilitary soldiers and injured two others.
	   In the state's summer capital, Srinagar, police and paramilitary
forces lobbed tear gas at nearly 1,000 Muslims marchers who threw
stones and chanted anti-India slogans. At least 18 people _
including six paramilitary troops _ were injured in the
confrontation with marchers who left the city's main mosque after
Friday prayers.

Four more nabbed in Japan for illegal sales of Viagra: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Police have arrested four men for allegedly
marketing the anti-impotence drug Viagra, which has not yet been
approved for sale in Japan, a news report said Friday.
	   The police action comes as the latest attempt to clamp down on a
thriving Japanese black market for the remedy, which is still
undergoing clinical testing by local authorities.
	   The four taken into custody by police in Niigata, on the Sea of
Japan 256 kilometers (160 miles) northwest of Tokyo, were charged
with violating the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law, Kyodo News agency
reported.
	   Police spokesmen in Niigata were unavailable for comment late
Friday.
	   Two of the men were suspected of selling Viagra for 6,000 yen
(dlrs 44.56) a pill, while the other two were allegedly found with
more than 100 pills which they had offered for sale in newspaper
ads, the report said.
	   Viagra costs about dlrs 10 a pill in the United States, where it
is manufactured by Pfizer Inc.
	   Last month, the owner of a trading company who allegedly sold
Viagra wholesale was arrested by police in Nagoya, a central city
269 kilometers (168 miles) west of Tokyo.

Ukraine to cover gas debt to Russia and Turkmenistan by supplying
</HEADLINE>
goods &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine will repay part of its gas debt to
Russia and Turkmenistan in commodities, a news report said Friday.
	   Ukrainian Prime Minister Valeriy Pustovoitenko said he reached
an agreement with Russian and Turkmen authorities to cover
Ukraine's gas debt with commodities by 2007, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   Pustovoitenko said the government is already negotiating terms
of sending some 1.8 billion hryvna (dlrs 545 million) worth of
goods to Russia and Turkmenistan.
	   He did not say how the commodities would be distributed between
the two countries, and the report did not describe the commodities
to be used.
	   Ukrainian officials have put the current debt to Russia's state
gas monopoly Gazprom at dlrs 640 million, of which the government
owes about dlrs 500 million and private traders the rest.
	   Earlier the government planned to repay the whole gas debt to
Russia by October.
	   Turkmenistan's President Saparamurat Niyazov said earlier this
year that Ukraine owes his country about dlrs 600 million for gas.
	   Ukraine, the world's sixth largest country in terms of gas
consumption, covers only about a fifth of its gas needs by domestic
production and imports the rest from Russia and Turkmenistan.
	   Ukraine's huge gas debt to the two countries has prompted
tension with Russia and led Turkmenistan to suspend gas supplies to
Ukraine last year.

Civil aviation workers back at work
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Civil aviation employees returned to work
Friday after an Athens court ruled their four-day strike illegal.
	   The strike, staged by the 2,700-strong civil aviation union,
began Thursday and caused flight delays and cancellations in
airports around the country.
	   Workers refused to service any charter flights and only some by
foreign carriers. Olympic Airways, Greece's national carrier, used
its own employees to fill strikers' posts.
	   The union was demanding more money and protesting government
plans to revamp the civil aviation service by splitting it up
according to specialization.
	   The strike was deemed illegal after civil aviation authorities
referred the case to court.

New Zealand, Australia win opening matches
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ New Zealand overcame a spirited
Tahiti 1-0 and Australia beat Fiji 3-1 Friday in opening matches in
the six-team Oceania Nations Cup soccer tournament at Suncorp
Stadium.
	   Tahiti, which played most of the match with just one striker,
held its own in the first half with the only goal coming from an
own goal in the 13th minute. Australia's three goals were scored by
Adelaide City striker Damian Mori.
	   The early New Zealand breakthrough came off a perfectly timed
cross from midfielder Aaran Lines which South Melbourne defender
Vaughan Coveny headed down.
	   Tahiti's goalkeeper Pat Jacquemet did a fine job scrambling to
save with his feet, but the ball rebounded off defender Heimana
Paama and trickled into the net.
	   New Zealand's win puts the All Whites on target to win their
pool and the likelihood of meeting Australia if, as expected, it
wins its group. The winner of the tournament qualifies for a spot
in next year's Confederations Cup tournament in Mexico.
	   Mori, back in the Australian squad following an overseas stint
in Germany last season, took just two minutes to stamp his mark on
the match. He scored again in the 26th minute and again on
halftime.
	   Fiji's only goal came midway through the second half when Esala
Masi struck a 30-meter drive which deflected off Socceroo
midfielder Kasey Wehrman.
	   The tournament resumes Monday when New Zealand plays Vanuatu and
Australia takes on the Cook Islands. All matches are being played
in Brisbane. (djp)

Government braces for battle with communists as it unveils 1999
</HEADLINE>
budget &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Cossiga comments &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's center-left government braced for a battle
with hard-line communists Friday as it prepared to present its
deficit-cutting 1999 budget to parliament.
	   The cabinet held a final meeting to discuss the budget Friday
morning. Details were expected later in the day.
	   Italy's Communist Refoundation Party is divided over whether to
back the budget, but hard-liners who say it doesn't do enough to
create jobs are expected to prevail.
	   Refoundation is not part of the governing coalition, but Premier
Romano Prodi needs its 34 votes to muster a majority in the lower
house.
	   Without them, he might have to turn elsewhere, but it would be
costly. The leader of the opposition centrists, former President
Francesco Cossiga, has said he might back Prodi's budget _ but only
if Prodi resigns in return.
	   The leader of Refoundation's moderate wing, Armando Cossutta,
has warned that the party risks provoking a government crisis that
could bring the right to power. But Fausto Bertinotti, the party's
hard-line secretary general, insists he can't back the plan.
	   ''I don't think Refoundation is bluffing,'' Cossiga said Friday.
	   The budget, designed to keep Italy in line with the requirements
for European monetary union, calls for dlrs 8 billion (13.5
trillion lire) in deficit-cutting measures. Italy is a charter
member of the euro, the common currency.
	   Cossiga said a budget crisis might force the government into a
vote of confidence, but that the Communists would likely back Prodi
in a confidence vote, as they have in the past.
	   Early elections on the eve of monetary union would be a
``catastrophe,'' Cossiga said, damaging Italy's international image
and shaking the confidence of its European partners.

	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ An unlikely opposition alliance
ranging from rightists to Greens entered Slovakia's nationwide
elections with high hopes Friday, intent on unseating a hard-line
government that has alienated its central European neighbors.
	   Hundreds of people filled downtown polling stations immediately
after the two-day balloting began Friday afternoon. But opposition
leaders said most voters would wait until Saturday due to fears of
vote-count fraud.
	   International human rights groups also have expressed concern of
possible election manipulation by the government, which last year
canceled a key ballot question on the eve of a referendum that
could have challenged its authoritarian grip on power.
	   Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar and his nationalist Movement for
a Democratic Slovakia have ruled largely uninterrupted and
unchallenged since the country broke from Czechoslovakia and became
independent in 1993.
	   But opposition forces that share little in common except a
dislike of the hard-line policies of ``Meciarism'' stand a good
chance of taking power if they stay united beyond the balloting.
	   ``We are surely going to win,'' opposition leader Milan Knazko
said as he cast his ballot. ``There needs to be a reform of this
autocratic government.''

Major find of old coins, jewelery made
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ An Austrian farmer plowing his field
unearthed a valuable trove of old silver coins and medieval
jewelry, a museum announced Friday.
	   The Upper Austrian Provincial Museum described the treasure as
``the largest ensemble of late medieval jewelry ever found in
Europe,'' the Austria Press Agency reported.
	   Experts date the jewelry and the 6,000 coins, some minted as far
away as England and Jerusalem, from the late 13th century.
	   The items were recently found in the field near Freistadt, about
140 kilometers (85 miles) northwest of Vienna. The museum paid a
reward of about one million schillings (dlrs 80,000) reward to the
farmer and another person, the agency reported.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Another bumper London Fashion Week got under way
Friday, bolstered by news that the government is to sponsor a
conference of British designers.
	   More than 50 designers, including Alexander McQueen, crowned
Designer of the Year at the 1997 British Fashion Awards, and
eccentric doyenne of British fashion, Vivienne Westwood, will hold
catwalk shows at venues around London during the five-day event.
	   Some 140 others are showing shoes, bags, scarves and other
accessories at the Natural History Museum, headquarters of Fashion
Week, compared to just 15 in 1993.
	   The first on the catwalk this time was Bangladeshi-born designer
Bibi Russell, who showed hand-woven fabrics made by Bangladeshi
villagers.
	   Others with shows include enfant terrible Hussein Chalayan, who
stunned the fashion world in 1993 with a display of garments made
from decomposing fabrics.
	   Upcoming British designer Andrew Groves, whose fabrics have
included surgical latex and who once introduced a swarm of wasps to
a show, is among the newcomers this time.
	   Launching the event Friday, Trade and Industry Secretary Peter
Mandelson said British fashion was already ``blooming,
blossoming,'' _ but to spur it to even greater success, the
government will stage the first British Fashion Designer Conference
on Nov. 25 in London.
	   Sponsored by the Labor Party government and the British Fashion
Council, the conference will look at designers' access to finance,
their relationship with manufacturers and how they can apply their
skills in new product areas, he said.
	   ``London Fashion Week is a tremendous advertisement for the
creativity of our fashion designers and the excellence of fashion
design education in the United Kingdom,'' said Mandelson.
	   ``The size of this season's event is a mark of the show's
international influence and the respect in which it is held across
the world.''
	   The British Fashion Council says the industry is now worth more
than 16 billion pounds (dlrs 27 billion) a year and employs some
350,000 people.

IMF team wraps up visit, but no sign of loan money

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Despite Russia's pleas for cash, an International
Monetary Fund team wrapped up a visit Friday without recommending
that Moscow receive the next installment of a dlrs 22.6 billion
loan package.
	   Russia badly wants the money to help stabilize an economy
wracked by surging inflation, rising unemployment and a falling
currency. But the IMF team left without agreeing to release
additional money and will return for further negotiations on Oct.
12, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   ``We have to reach some decisions by the end of October,''
Alexander Mozhin, the IMF's acting director for Russia, was quoted
as saying by the Interfax news agency.
	   Russia signed the loan agreement with the IMF and other
international lenders in July, and shortly thereafter received the
first installment from the IMF, worth dlrs 4.8 billion. However,
that did not prevent Russia from sliding into a full-fledged crisis
last month.
	   Russia has been hoping for another dlrs 4.3 billion from the IMF
by the end of September. But the IMF has said it doesn't intend to
release more money to Russia until it's satisfied that the country
has sound economic policies in place.
	   ``Reaching an agreement between the IMF and Russia is important
for both of us,'' the head of the Russian delegation, Deputy Prime
Minister Alexander Shohkin, said Friday. ``Today we need such
support very much.''
	   In another development, a plan to pay out money to Russians from
their frozen bank accounts won't begin until Nov. 30, two weeks
later than previously planned, news reports said.
	   Russia's new government is trying to bail out the country's
troubled commercial banks, which have been largely paralyzed by the
economic crisis. Most major banks are either closed or have been
conducting only limited transactions.
	   As part of a plan to protect ordinary citizens, the government
has said that individual depositors may transfer their savings from
the ailing commercial banks to the state-controlled Sberbank, where
their money would be guaranteed by the government.
	   Some bank branches are still operating, but limit the amount of
money that customers can withdraw. Most business accounts have been
frozen, making it impossible for firms to make payments and bank
transfers. This has clogged up the country's entire financial
network.
	   The new government of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has been
providing billions of rubles worth of credits and loans to the
banks in a bid to get money flowing through the financial system.
	   Some banks have been clearing up their debts, but it's still not
clear which will be able to resume normal operations soon, and
which are too debt-ridden to be rescued.
	   In other developments Friday:
	   _ President Boris Yeltsin filled many of the empty Cabinet
posts. Mikhail Zadornov, the finance minister in the previous
government, will keep his job in the new government.
	   _ Primakov said Friday that his government would try to clean up
the criminal activity that is pervasive in the country's
unregulated ``shadow economy.''
	   _ Russia's foreign trade for the first seven months of this year
totaled dlrs 71.9 billion, down 5 percent from the same period a
year earlier, the State Statistics Committee said.
	   _ Russia's feeble tax collection will be well below its target
of 15 billion rubles (dlrs 1 billion) this month, due in part to
the crisis, said Igor Selivamov, deputy chief of the State Tax
Service.
	   ``Tax payments often don't reach the budget because the banking
system is failing,'' he said.

Rugova's closest aide seriously wounded in attack
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more fighting southwest of Pristina
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A close aide of Kosovo's ethnic
Albanian leader has been shot and seriously wounded, in what could
be a warning to pacifist Ibrahim Rugova to demand nothing less than
independence for Kosovo from Serbia.
	   Sabri Hamiti was attacked late Thursday in front of his house in
a Pristina suburb, sources close to Rugova said Friday. Two bullets
ended up just above his heart and one broke his arm. Hamiti was
taken to Pristina hospital.
	   Hamiti, 50, is believed to be the closest aide of Rugova. The
main ethnic Albanian political leader in Kosovo, Rugova has showed
readiness to negotiate an agreement for the Serbian province which
falls short of independence.
	   At a press conference Friday, a visibly shaken Rugova said
``this was an attack on Kosovo institutions and prominent public
figures, not only in Kosovo, but in the whole region.''
	   He said the attack ``only further destabilizes the situation in
Kosovo and the whole region.''
	   It was not clear who shot at Hamiti. The attack came only days
after another Rugova aide, the ``defense minister'' in the ethnic
Albanian self-proclaimed government in Kosovo, Ahmet Krasniqi, was
shot and killed in neighboring Albania.
	   The attack on Hamiti may present a warning to Rugova by more
radical factions among ethnic Albanians who reject any deal with
the government of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Most ethnic Albanians in Kosovo want independence. Kosovo is
part of Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   Serbia and the West rule out independence for Kosovo. There have
been signs that Rugova and Milosevic could sign a U.S.-backed
agreement that would give Kosovo a degree of self-rule but would
leave it part of Serbia and within Yugoslavia.
	   Rugova faces opposition over such a deal from the rebel ethnic
Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which has been fighting for
independence for Kosovo. The rebels have pledged to ``punish''
anyone who gives up that goal.
	   But the militants, who had control over some 40 percent of
Kosovo half a year ago, have been largely defeated by Serbian
police and the Yugoslav army after seven months of fighting.
	   Serb sources in Pristina said Friday that the government forces
had ended the latest offensive in the Cicavica mountain, northwest
of the capital Pristina, and rooted out the rebels. A mop-up
operation was underway, they said, indicating lower-level fighting
was continuing.
	   But ethnic Albanian reports said fighting continued in the
central Drenica region. Reporters southwest of Pristina saw several
villages burning and heard artillery fire at 10-second intervals,
as well as bursts of heavy machine-gun fire.
	   An ethnic Albanian human rights group claimed Serb forces killed
seven men Thursday evening. The Council for Defense of Human Rights
and Freedoms, based in Pristina, also said Serbs were separating
Albanian men and detaining them.

Ethiopia accuses Eritrea of ethnic cleansing; U.S. delegation
</HEADLINE>
expected &QL; 
 &UR; By ABEBE ANDUALEM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Ethiopia has accused Eritrea of
carrying out ethnic cleansing through systematic deportation of
Ethiopians living in Eritrea.
	   ``The Eritrean government seems determined to ethnic cleanse
Ethiopians in Eritrea by systematically but indiscriminately
deporting Ethiopians after making life intolerable for them,''
government spokeswoman Selome Tadesse said in a statement Friday.
	   She said Eritrea had not given any reason for the action and
said some Ethiopians had been killed in the process. The statement
did not give a figure, and it was not immediately possible to
obtain comment from Eritrean officials.
	   Quoting figures from the Ethiopian Disaster Prevention and
Preparedness Commission, she said 24,970 Ethiopians have been
deported from Eritrea since a border dispute erupted into a brief
but intense shooting war between the two Horn of Africa nations in
May.
	   All attempts to mediate between the two countries have failed. A
delegation headed by former U.S. national security adviser Anthony
Lake is expected in the region this weekend.
	   The Ethiopians say they are glad he is coming; the Eritreans
blame earlier U.S. peace efforts for complicating things.
	   At the beginning of the crisis, Eritrea expelled a few hundred
Ethiopians every week. But Ethiopia says the numbers are growing.
	   Ethiopia expelled another 2,000 Eritreans early this week, most
of them the wives and children of Eritrean nationals expelled
earlier for allegedly raising funds for the Eritreans war effort
and spying for their government.
	   Many of those expelled earlier were successful businessmen who
had to leave everything behind.
	   Ethiopia says it has expelled about 8,000 Eritreans, but Eritrea
puts the figure at 20,000.
	   Political analysts in the Ethiopian capital say the stepped up
war of words and the mass expulsion of each other's nationals can
only lead to renewed fighting between the formerly friendly
neighbors in the Horn of Africa.
	   Both countries settled into a ``no war, no peace'' situation
after three days of bloody ground fighting along their long common
border and air raids against civilians and military targets.
	   A moratorium on fighting brokered by U.S President Bill Clinton
last June is still holding.
	   But in the meantime, both sides have dug in thousands of troops
in trenches and have purchased and moved to the front additional
tanks, artillery, multi-rocket launchers and other weapons.
	   Senior Ethiopian officials have repeatedly declared that all-
out war is inevitable unless Eritrea withdraws its troops from two
contested districts in northwestern Ethiopia they occupied in May.
	   The Organization of African Unity had been expected to discuss
the conflict this week, but an OAU spokesman said the 16 members of
the body's organ on conflict prevention and resolution were still
at the planning stage.

Israel grants citizenship to converts, but only after court fight
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a closely watched case, a Chicago woman and
her children who converted to Judaism are to be granted Israeli
citizenship after taking the Israeli government to court.
	   However, an Israeli rabbi who had fought for the U.S. family's
recognition as Israeli citizens said Friday that despite the
victory he did not expect the government to make it any easier for
other converts to be granted citizenship.
	   Sarah Yaisrael and her four children were notified Thursday by
the Interior Ministry that they are to receive citizenship papers.
Her husband Elazar received Israeli citizenship in 1996.
	   The issue is that the family members were converted by the
Conservative movement, one of the liberal streams of Judaism that
is trying to gain a foothold in Israel.
	   The powerful Orthodox Jewish stream of Judaism in Israel
campaigns actively against the Conservative and Reform movements,
successfully limiting their practice in Israel.
	   Rabbi Ehud Bendel, president of the Conservative movement in
Israel, charges that the Israeli government is harassing his
followers. He said in recent years, the Interior Ministry has
refused to abide by a decision of the Israeli Supreme Court that
Conservative conversions done abroad be recognized in Israel.
	   ``In the end, the result is always the same,'' he said. ``After
we take them to court, citizenship is granted. It just takes time
and trouble.''
	   Under Israel's Law of Return, Jews are entitled to citizenship.
	   Mrs. Yaisrael sounded hopeful but sobered by her experience. ``I
can't say that it's like the land of milk and honey here,'' she
said, referring to the Biblical description of the Holy Land.
	   The citizenship issue is symptomatic of the larger conflict
between the streams of Jewish religion in Israel. Conservative and
Reform rabbis are not recognized by the religious establishment.
They are not allowed to perform weddings or other religious
functions.
	   Israel does not recognize Conservative and Reform conversions
performed at home.
	   Bendel said his movement is pressing for a Supreme Court
decision on Conservative and Reform conversions in Israel.

Rushdie celebrates end of 'terrorist threat' from Iran
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-UN-Iran-Rushdie &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Salman Rushdie on Friday celebrated ``the end of a
dreadful terrorist threat against a citizen of another country''
and said he was not seeking apologies from those who forced him
into hiding for nearly a decade.
	   ``The reason we have been able to fight this campaign is because
the issue has been kept alive, not just because someone's life was
in danger, but because it was an important battle that we were
fighting for _ freedom of the imagination and the right of free
speech,'' Rushdie told a news conference.
	   Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi announced in New York
Thursday that his country would distance itself from a dlrs 2.5
million reward for killing Rushdie, who was accused of insulting
Islam in his novel, ``The Satanic Verses.''
	   Rushdie said he had no regrets about writing the book.
	   ``The Satanic Verses is as important in my body of work as any
of my other books. I cannot imagine my body of work without it
there, in the sense that I am content with the book that I wrote,''
he said.
	   However, Rushdie said he was ``sorrowful for all the people who
have died in demonstrations against The Satanic Verses,
particularly in the subcontinent _ indeed I feel in many cases they
did not even know what they were demonstrating against.''
	   The writer said he had been particularly hurt when India, his
native country, had banned the book and turned against him.
	   ``I have not been permitted at any time to be in the country of
my birth, the country that has been the inspiration of my works. I
am not able to get a visa to travel to India. That has been a
matter of great grief and pain to me.''
	   Rushdie confessed that he had lied in 1990 when, in an effort to
have the Iranian fatwa rescinded, he publicly declared that he had
``embraced Islam.'' Although raised in a Muslim family, Rushdie
said he was not a religious person and that the 1990 was a low
point in his ordeal.
	   Asked by a reporter if he is a Muslim now, Rushdie replied: ``I
am happy to say that I am not.''

Needing to use bathroom, politician felt treed by reporters
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: note contents &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Although he had a fierce need to
visit the restroom, politician Uffe Ellemann-Jensen didn't want to
leak any information to the reporters standing outside his office
door.
	   So he turned for relief to a potted plant in his inner sanctum,
he reveals in newly published memoirs.
	   The anecdote got wide attention in Danish media. But although
it's a case of a politician with unzipped trousers, it's unlikely
to provoke a scandal. Ellemann-Jensen asked all the women to leave
the room first, he says.
	   The incident occurred after voting closed in national elections
on March 11. The Liberal Party, led by Ellemann-Jensen, and the
Labor Party of Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen were
neck-and-neck as the returns poured in.
	   TV reporters camped outside both politicians' offices, waylaying
anyone who walked out for comment.
	   ``The moment I opened the door I would be live on the television
channels and I couldn't just say that I was on my way to the
bathroom,'' Ellemann-Jensen wrote.
	   ``There wasn't anything else to do but ask the women to leave my
office'' and relieve himself on the plant, he said.
	   Ellemann-Jensen stepped down after his party lost the election.
He told Denmark's TV2 channel Thursday that he took the plant along
when he moved out of the office. ``I now have it at home and it's
doing fine.''

Russian fighter jet crashes, killing pilot
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian MiG-29 fighter jet crashed Friday while
on a training flight and the pilot was killed.
	   The crash occurred shortly after the jet had taken off from a
military air base near the city of Chita in central Siberia, about
4700 kilometers (3,000 miles) east of Moscow, the Interfax news
agency reported, citing military officials.
	   There were no casualties or damage on the ground, it said.
	   According to the report, the apparent reason for the crash was
the failure of the plane's engines.
	   The twin-engine MiG-29, which is capable of flying at twice the
speed of sound, is a mainstay of the Russian Air Force. It
generally has been considered a reliable aircraft and few MiG-29
crashes have been reported.
	   Many recent accidents involving Russian military aircraft have
been linked to a severe government funding shortage that makes it
hard for the air force to maintain its fleet and deprives pilots of
regular practice.

Fugitive accused of selling nuclear secrets to Iraq surrenders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ A German engineer suspected of selling nuclear
technology to Iraq was ordered jailed Friday, a day after he
returned home from Brazil and gave himself up so that he could
visit his terminally ill mother.
	   Karl-Heinz Schaab, a fugitive since January 1996, was arrested
at Frankfurt airport Thursday after arriving on a Lufthansa flight
from Sao Paulo, Brazil.
	   Federal prosecutor Kay Nehm said Schaab, who has been under
investigation for treason since 1995, is suspected of helping Iraq
produce weapons grade uranium in 1989-90.
	   The 64-year-old engineer allegedly sold Iraq construction plans
for a uranium enrichment plant for 2 million marks (dlrs 1.2
million). The plans were found by U.N. inspectors in Iraq.
	   Schaab, who was placed on probation after a 1993 conviction for
violating export laws, disappeared from his home in the Bavarian
town of Kaufbeuren in January 1996.
	   He was arrested in December that year in Rio de Janeiro while
reportedly trying to obtain a permanent visa, but released after 15
months in custody when Brazil's supreme court rejected Germany's
extradition request.
	   Early this year, Schaab hired a German lawyer to negotiate his
return. Nehm said he told prosecutors he wanted to be allowed to
visit his 96-year-old mother, who is terminally ill.
	   ``It was his greatest wish to see his mother alive once more,''
his attorney, Michael Rietz, said in Friday's Bild newspaper.
	   The two spent two hours together Thursday before Schaab was
brought by BMW limousine to a Bavarian prison, the newspaper said.
He appeared in court Friday in Munich and was ordered held pending
trial.
	   Rietz told Bild that Schaab plans to make a confession.
	   ``He helped with the Iraqi nuclear program and realizes today
that he has brought a great burden of guilt upon himself,'' Rietz
was quoted as saying. ``However, he says he was not the only one
involved.''
	   Rietz was not in his Muenster office Friday for comment.
	   In a 1996 interview with Der Spiegel newsmagazine, Schaab
admitted providing technical information to Iraq, but said at least
four other German nuclear experts also were involved in helping to
set up the uranium enrichment plant.
	   The magazine quoted Schaab as saying secret documents were
``insufficiently secured by his former employer,'' the Munich-based
MAN company, which produces heavy machinery.

Hong Kong and British police smash credit card sydndicate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ British police and Hong Kong anti-corruption
agents have arrested seven people and smashed an international
credit card counterfeiting syndicate, the government reported
Friday.
	   Hong Kong's Independent Commission Against Corruption said that
during the joint operation on Thursday, British police in Wales
arrested five men who are believed to key members of the syndicate.
	   A commission statement said British police also seized
counterfeit credit cards and equipment used for manufucturing such
cards. It said the forged cards were intended for use in retail
outlets in the British city of Manchester.
	   In Hong Kong, the commission has arrested three people _ two men
and a woman _ and seized a computer suspected to have been used for
manufacturing counterfeit credit cards.
	   The joint British-Hong Kong operation has prevented a potential
loss of 6.25 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 801,282) to
various financial institutions, it said.
	   Investigations into the syndicate were continuing, the
commission said.

Hakkinen posts the fastest time in free practice

<TEXT>
	   NUERBURGRING, Germany (AP) _ Mika Hakkinen bolstered his Formula
One championship hopes when he posted by far the fastest time in
free practice Friday for the Luxembourg Grand Prix.
	   Hakkinen was more than seventh-tenths of a second faster in a
McLaren-Mercedes than his only rival in the battle for the title,
Michael Schumacher. The two drivers are tied on 80 points going
into the penultimate race of the season.
	   With less than a minute remaining in the session, Hakkinen
produced a blistering lap around the 4.556-kilometer (2.831-mile)
circuit in one minute, 19.689 seconds.
	   The Finn had been fourth until he blasted to the top at the end
of the session.
	   Although the free practice is spent testing various set-ups and
tires and usually has little bearing on the outcome, Hakkinen's
overwhelming performance is certain to give him a psychological
boost.
	   Schumacher dropped to fourth in his Ferrari, 0.772 seconds
behind Hakkinen.
	   Giancarlo Fisichella in a Benetton was second, 0.636 seconds
slower than Hakkinen. Outgoing world champion Jacques Villeneuve,
winner of the last two races here, was third in his Williams, 0.637
behind Hakkinen and just one-thousandth of a second behind
Fisichella.
	   Hakkinen's McLaren teammate David Coulthard was fifth, while
Eddie Irvine, the second Ferrari driver, was sixth.
	   The free practice was held in sunshine and mild temperatures,
but the forecast predicts cooler and wetter weather for Sunday's
race and possibly for Saturday's qualifying.
	   Schumacher is acknowledged as a superior driver in wet
conditions. He also knows well the circuit, which is about an
hour's drive away from his hometown of Kerpen.
	   Although the race officially carries the title of Luxembourg
Grand Prix, it takes place across the border in Germany. Schumacher
won here in 1995.
	   Schumacher will also have the support of 140,000 fans expected
to come to the race.
	   While the two McLaren cars dominated the early past of the
season, winning five of six opening races, Schumacher has led a
strong Ferrari comeback.
	   The German has won two of the last three races and comes off a
vintage performance two weeks ago at Monza, Italy, where he led a
1-2 Ferrari triumph.
	   Both Hakkinen and Schumacher have won six races this season, but
the Finn holds an edge under Formula One tie-breaking rules because
he has two second places to Schumacher's one.
	   Unless Hakkinen wins Sunday and Schumacher fails to score a
point, the championship battle will be decided in Japan on Nov. 1,
the last race of the season.
	   Meanwhile, the Stewart-Ford team announced that its Brazilian
driver, Rubens Barrichello, will remain for the 1999 season.
Barrichello will partner British driver Johnny Herbert, who is
moving from Sauber.

South Korea closes two securities companies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea decided on Friday to shut
down two financially unstable securities companies as part of its
banking industry reform to woo back foreign investors.
	   In August, the government gave KLB Securities Co., Dongbang
Peregrine Securities Co. and two others until mid-September to work
out ways to boost their financial standing.
	   On Friday, the government's Financial Supervisory Commission
said it will strip KLB Securities and Dongbang Peregrine Securities
of their licenses, saying they had no chance to survive.
	   Ssangyong Investment and Securities Co. and SK Securities Co.
were given a tentative approval to continue their business.
	   Last Friday, U.S. investment firm Hambrecht and Quist Group Inc.
signed a deal to take over Ssangyong Investment and Securities Co.
	   As part of the deal, South Korean creditor banks agreed to
provide dlrs 158 million in new loans to help improve Ssangyong
Securities' cash flow. In return, Hambrecht and Quist planned to
inject dlrs 110 million into Ssangyong.
	   Ssangyong also promised to sell buildings and other properties
to raise cash.
	   SK Securities presented the financial watchdog commission with
plans to bring in 400 billion won (dlrs 289 million) in new
investment in the next year.
	   President Kim Dae-jung's administration is goading the
bad-debt-ridden South Korean financial industry into restructuring
to become more efficient.
	   When the economy slowed down and companies began collapsing last
year, banks and securities companies were left with mounds of bad
loans, prompting a sudden loss of international confidence that led
to South Korea's financial crisis.
	   The government so far has shut down 16 merchant banks and four
insurance companies and forced five commercial banks to be merged
with bigger banks.
	   The restructuring is a key promise South Korea made in exchange
for a dlrs 58 billion bailout of its economy by the International
Monetary Fund in December.

Ceausescu children get parents' death certificates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The children of Romania's last
communist dictator have received their parents' death certificates
nearly a decade after they were executed, a newspaper reported
Friday.
	   The documents were drawn up by the defense ministry after Zoe
Ceausescu, daughter of Nicolae and Elena Ceausescu, initiated a
lawsuit against it in May, following an eight-year battle to get
the certificates, the Curierul National reported.
	   Ceausescu's 25 years of harsh rule ended when he and his wife
were shot to death by a firing squad on Christmas Day 1989, after a
summary trial by a military court in the city of Targoviste, about
80 kilometers (50 miles) northwest of Bucharest.
	   The Ceausescus were accused of genocide and undermining the
national economy. About 1,000 people died during the 1989
anti-communist uprising as forces loyal to Ceausescu battled with
street protesters.
	   Ceausescu son Valentin has complained that authorities ignored
the family's request for the death certificates and the return of
the family goods. The family wants the certificates because that is
the normal way to officially record someone's death.
	   But Defense Ministry spokeswoman Lilian Zamfiroiu said Friday
the ministry had received no requests to release the certificates.
He said the timing of the lawsuit and its handing over of
certificates were coincidental.
	   The death certificates weren't issued immediately after the
executions because the country was mired in chaos, with
institutions and officials changing overnight.
	   The circumstances of the Ceausescus' execution and the way the
post-revolutionary government of second-level communists took over
remain murky. Nobody has been convicted in the killings.

Belgian interior minister offers resignation over death of

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Belgium's government plunged into
crisis Friday after the interior minister offered to resign over
the police's role in the death of a Nigerian woman facing
deportation.
	   Socialist minister Louis Tobback, a key player in Belgium's
efforts to reform its embattled police and security forces, offered
to resign late Thursday, but King Albert II still had not decided
whether to accept it Friday. The center-left ruling coalition was
trying to keep Tobback, who is also a vice-premier, on the job.
	   ``I hope he can still change his mind. He is very important
within the government,'' said Justice Minister Tony Van Parys, a
Christian Democrat, at Friday's weekly Cabinet session.
	   Semira Adamu, 20, died in a Brussels hospital Tuesday from a
brain hemorrhage, hours after police had stuffed a pillow over her
mouth to restrain her on a plane that was about to depart for
Africa.
	   Tobback's decision came after he learned that one of the two
policemen who had tried to subdue Adamu had already been punished
by the police force last year for repeatedly kicking an asylum
seeker.
	   Tobback, who is responsible for the police force, said his
resignation offer was based on the fact that ``a policeman who had
been sanctioned for serious offenses against a deportee was allowed
to be within the division and told to carry out this delicate
task.''
	   The police officer in question was not allowed on deportation
duty for seven months after the January 1997 incident.
	   After he was reintegrated in the service, he was always
supervised and videotaped during deportation operations. Police
spokeswoman Els Cleemput pointed out he was not the man holding the
pillow on Adamu's face.
	   Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene opened the weekly Cabinet
meeting without Tobback on Friday. King Albert II was in Lisbon,
Portugal and would only return late Friday. That time would be used
to try to sway Tobback.
	   Protesters called for Tobback's resignation for three straight
days.
	   It was the second time in five months the interior minister had
to resign. Another Socialist, Johan Vande Lanotte, stepped down
after the key suspect in a pedophile case that has gripped
Belgians, Marc Dutroux, briefly escaped.
	   Tobback, 60, had been interior minister from 1988 to 1994. He
was mayor of the university town of Leuven when Vande Lanotte's
resignation forced him back into national politics.
	   The government Thursday suspended the deportation of asylum
seekers from Brussels international airport until new measures were
approved.
	   Adamu had resisted deportation five previous times and her story
had touched a nerve in the nation.
	   She resisted returning to Nigeria because she claimed her family
was forcing her to marry a 65-year-old man who already has three
wives. Belgium argued that was not sufficient to grant her refugee
status.
	   Cleemput said a pillow to subdue deportees was only used twice
last year. But this year resistance from deportees had increased
and the police had to use the practice a dozen times already.

Iran shows off force in military parade near Afghan border
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MASHHAD, Iran (AP) _ More than 10,000 soldiers marched Friday in
a military parade in the holy city of Mashhad near the Afghan
border in a show of force targeted at Afghanistan's Taliban army.
	   The parade _ and similar ones in the capital Tehran and Taibad,
the closest Iranian town to Afghanistan _ came amid rising tensions
between Iran and the Taliban over last month's slaying of Iranian
diplomats by Taliban fighters.
	   In Tehran, the newly developed Shahab-3 missile with a
1,300-kilometer (800-mile) range capable of reaching Israel was
displayed on a launcher as thousands of soldiers paraded with
artillery, anti-aircraft guns and armored personnel carriers.
	   The four-hour march in Mashhad's main square, attended by
Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani and other senior officials, showed
off dozens of tanks and personnel carriers. U.S.-made F-4 and F-5
jet fighters and Cobra helicopters flew overhead, left over from
the U.S.-Iranian alliance before the 1979 Islamic revolution.
	   ``If any enemy wants to do mischief against our country, they
should know that they are playing with the tail of the lion,'' an
announcer said during the parade. ``We will throw them in history's
garbage.''
	   Shamkhani told the troops and thousands of Iranian spectators
that Iran was trying to avoid war with Afghanistan and would rather
use its might against Israel.
	   ``Iran, with its powerful military forces, is completely ready
to defend its national security ... but we hope with the patience
of Iranian officials we won't use this readiness against anyone
except the occupying Zionist regime,'' Shamkhani said.
	   Mashhad, which is 900 kilometers (560 miles) northeast of
Tehran, is home to the shrine of Imam Reza, an important Shiite
Muslim saint.
	   Friday's parades came amid growing demands for vengeance against
the Taliban by Iranian demonstrators. Iran has sent tens of
thousands of troops near the Afghan border, and the Taliban says it
has moved 20,000 troops to the border to defend itself.
	   Tensions have risen since the Taliban overran the city of
Mazar-e-Sharif in northern Afghanistan on Aug. 8 and killed nine
Iranian diplomats posted there and an Iranian journalist.
	   The Taliban Islamic militia, which rules about 90 percent of
Afghanistan, blames renegade fighters for the slayings, but has
refused Iranian demands to hand over the killers. The Taliban
accuses Iran of backing Afghanistan's northern-based opposition.

Ethiopia accuses Eritrea of ethnic cleansing; U.S. delegation
</HEADLINE>
expected
 &UR; By ABEBE ANDUALEM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Ethiopia has accused Eritrea of
carrying out ethnic cleansing through systematic deportation of
Ethiopians living in Eritrea.
	   ``The Eritrean government seems determined to ethnic cleanse
Ethiopians in Eritrea by systematically but indiscriminately
deporting Ethiopians after making life intolerable for them,''
government spokeswoman Selome Tadesse said in a statement Friday.
	   She said Eritrea had not given any reason for the action and
said some Ethiopians had been killed in the process. The statement
did not give a figure, and it was not immediately possible to
obtain comment from Eritrean officials.
	   Quoting figures from the Ethiopian Disaster Prevention and
Preparedness Commission, she said 24,970 Ethiopians have been
deported from Eritrea since a border dispute erupted into a brief
but intense shooting war between the two Horn of Africa nations in
May.
	   All attempts to mediate between the two countries have failed. A
delegation headed by former U.S. national security adviser Anthony
Lake is expected in the region this weekend.
	   The Ethiopians say they are glad he is coming; the Eritreans
blame earlier U.S. peace efforts for complicating things.
	   At the beginning of the crisis, Eritrea expelled a few hundred
Ethiopians every week. But Ethiopia says the numbers are growing.
	   Ethiopia expelled another 2,000 Eritreans early this week, most
of them the wives and children of Eritrean nationals expelled
earlier for allegedly raising funds for the Eritreans war effort
and spying for their government.
	   Many of those expelled earlier were successful businessmen who
had to leave everything behind.
	   Ethiopia says it has expelled about 8,000 Eritreans, but Eritrea
puts the figure at 20,000.
	   Political analysts in the Ethiopian capital say the stepped up
war of words and the mass expulsion of each other's nationals can
only lead to renewed fighting between the formerly friendly
neighbors in the Horn of Africa.
	   Both countries settled into a ``no war, no peace'' situation
after three days of bloody ground fighting along their long common
border and air raids against civilians and military targets.
	   A moratorium on fighting brokered by U.S President Bill Clinton
last June is still holding.
	   But in the meantime, both sides have dug in thousands of troops
in trenches and have purchased and moved to the front additional
tanks, artillery, multi-rocket launchers and other weapons.
	   Senior Ethiopian officials have repeatedly declared that all-
out war is inevitable unless Eritrea withdraws its troops from two
contested districts in northwestern Ethiopia they occupied in May.
	   The Organization of African Unity had been expected to discuss
the conflict this week, but an OAU spokesman said the 16 members of
the body's organ on conflict prevention and resolution were still
at the planning stage.

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Slava Dosedel upset Wayne
Ferreira's in straight sets and Bohdan Ulihrach crushed Marcos
Ondruska, putting the Czech Republic up 2-0 in a Davis Cup World
Group tie played here Friday.
	   Dosedel, ranked 61st in the world beat the often double-faulting
Ferreira 6-2, 6-3, 6-4 in 93 minutes to give Czechs the crucial 1-0
lead.
	   ``I did not break him (Ferreira) physically, but mentally and
that's even better,'' said Dosedel after the match.
	   Dosedel broke Ferreira's serve for the first time in the fifth
game of the match, adding another break of serve in the seventh
game. From then on, it was a one-way street.
	   ``I didn't feel comfortable today, I could not find my rhythm''
said the 36th-ranked Ferreira, who committed a total of 11 double
faults. ``It was my first match on clay since the French Open.''
	   In the second match of the day, Bohdan Ulihrach crushed Marcos
Ondruska 6-1, 6-2, 6-1 in an equally one-sided match that put the
Czech team ahead 2-0.
	   In a duel of powerful baseliners, Ulihrach was the better of the
two, never allowing his opponent in the match.
	   ``I can't remember the last time I played this well,'' Ulihrach
said.
	   In Saturday's doubles, David Rikl and Jiri Novak will face
Ferreira and Piet Norval. The reverse singles are scheduled for
Sunday.

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ An unlikely opposition alliance
ranging from rightists to Greens entered Slovakia's elections with
high hopes Friday, intent on unseating a hard-line government that
has alienated its central European neighbors.
	   Hundreds of people filled downtown polling stations immediately
after the two-day balloting began Friday afternoon. But opposition
leaders said most voters would wait until Saturday because of fears
of fraudulent counting.
	   International human rights groups also have expressed concern of
possible election manipulation by the government, which last year
canceled a key ballot question on the eve of a referendum that
could have challenged its authoritarian grip on power.
	   Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar and his nationalist Movement for
a Democratic Slovakia have ruled largely uninterrupted and
unchallenged since Czechoslovakia split and Slovakia became
independent in 1993.
	   But opposition forces with little in common except a dislike of
the hard-line policies of ``Meciarism'' stand a good chance of
taking power if they stay united beyond the balloting.
	   ``We are surely going to win,'' opposition leader Milan Knazko
said as he cast his ballot. ``There needs to be a reform of this
autocratic government.''
	   Meciar's HZDS, as it is widely known, has powerful backers in
the state media and in privatized industries and is favored to get
the most votes of the 17 parties competing for the 150 seats in
Parliament. But analysts say its prospects for finding enough
allies to forge a majority coalition are bleak because of dwindling
support.
	   Of the six parties expected to receive the minimum 5 percent
required to earn seats in parliament, only the far-right Slovak
National Party, Meciar's main coalition partner in the current
government, has expressed willingness to work with him. But that
party is not expected to win many seats.
	   Standing ready to try to take over is a rejuvenated opposition,
led by a recently formed five-party alliance _ the Slovak
Democratic Coalition _ that includes Christian conservatives,
social free-marketeers and Greens.
	   ``We will stick together,'' coalition leader Mikulas Dzurinda
pledged on the eve of the vote ``If there are problems, we are
going to stay together, because we will always remember the bad
times under Meciar.''
	   Opposition leaders say they would steer the nation on a vastly
different course, embracing the free-market and democratic reforms
needed to gain Slovakia entry into Western institutions.
	   ``The next few weeks are the best chance yet for democracy in
Slovakia,'' says Martin Butora, president of the Institute for
Public Affairs, an independent Bratislava think tank.
	   Despite authorities' efforts to clamp down on dissent and
hamstring the opposition, Butora says there has been a surge in
civic involvement by pro-Western Slovaks who want change.
	   Meciar and his ruling party have responded by imposing controls
on the media and non-governmental organizations, calling them
``subversive.''
	   He also has drawn criticism for his treatment of the
560,000-strong Hungarian minority that comprises over 10 percent of
Slovakia's population. He evoked comparisons to the ``ethnic
cleansing'' practices of the Bosnian war by proposing to Hungary
their ``voluntary repatriation.''
	   Slovakia's chances of being admitted to NATO or the European
Union any time soon may hinge on a change in government. The EU
excluded the nation of 5.5 million from the first round of
membership expansion, primarily because of alleged failings in its
democratic system.
	   Other issues on voters' minds are Slovakia's 14 percent
unemployment, rising crime, the deterioration of the health care
and education systems and an economy that still trails that of its
neighbors.

Spanish airliner crashes in Morocco, killing 38

 &UR; Eds: RAISES number of bodies recovered, ADDS background on airline
and on prvs crashes in Spain, corrects mission of plane that
spotted wreckage &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A Spanish airliner crashed into a hill in
northern Morocco on Friday and broke into pieces, killing all 38
people aboard.
	   Rescue workers have recovered 19 bodies so far, said an official
of the regional government in Melilla, a tiny Spanish enclave on
Morocco's Mediterranean coast.
	   The plane was carrying 34 passengers and four crew members to
Melilla from the southern port city of Malaga. It went down in
Moroccan territory about 18 kilometers (11 miles) north of Melilla
as it approached for landing.
	   The cause of the accident was not known, although visibility at
the airport was said to be poor.
	   ``It appears the plane crashed into a hilltop and broke into
pieces,'' said Melilla's regional government chief, Enrique
Palacios, who is also the city's mayor.
	   A government official said the plane had broken into three
pieces.
	   The majority of the passengers were Spaniards although it is
believed there were several Moroccans aboard, the state news agency
Efe said.
	   Moroccan authorities are allowing Spanish ambulances to the
crash site to help with rescue efforts, officials said.
	   The 86-seat, British-built BAE 146 belonged to a Spanish charter
airline called Pauknair, which specializes in flights between
Melilla and cities in Spain proper. The one between Melilla and
Malaga takes about 30 minutes. The airline runs 55 of them per
week.
	   The wreckage of the plane that crashed Friday was spotted by a
Spanish air force plane carrying out maneuvers.
	   Sources close to Pauknair in Morocco said the last radio contact
with the plane was made at 8.55 a.m. (0655 GMT) from Melilla.
	   The plane left Malaga at 8:15 a.m. and crashed in an area of
rugged terrain called Cap des Trois Fourches. The sources spoke on
condition they not be named.
	   It was the first serious air crash involving a Spanish airline
in more than 13 years. The last occurred near the Basque city of
Bilbao on February 19, 1985 when a Madrid-bound Boeing 727 of the
state carrier Iberia hit a television antenna on top of a hill and
crashed, killing 148 people.
	   Spain's _ and history's _ most deadly aviation disaster came on
March 27, 1977 on a runway at Tenerife airport in the Canary
Islands when a KLM jetliner crashed head-on with a Pan American
jumbo jet on the runway. The accident claimed 585 lives.

Aide to ethnic Albanian leader seriously wounded in attack
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reaction from Rugova, Albanian leader welcoming
NATO preparedness to act. &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A close aide of Kosovo's ethnic
Albanian leader has been seriously wounded in an attack that could
be a warning to the pacifist Ibrahim Rugova to demand nothing less
than independence for the restive Serbian province.
	   Sabri Hamiti was attacked late Thursday in front of his house in
a suburb of Pristina, the provincial capital, sources close to
Rugova said Friday. Two bullets lodged just above his heart and one
broke his arm. Hamiti was taken to a Pristina hospital.
	   Hamiti, 50, is believed to be the closest aide of Rugova, who
favors political negotiation to resolve the conflict between
separatist rebels and the Serbian government. The main ethnic
Albanian political leader in Kosovo, Rugova has been open to
accepting a peace agreement for the Serbian province that would
fall short of independence.
	   At a press conference Friday, a visibly shaken Rugova said
``this was an attack on Kosovo institutions and prominent public
figures, not only in Kosovo, but in the whole region.''
	   He said the attack ``only further destabilizes the situation in
Kosovo and the whole region.''
	   The Serb crackdown against ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo,
which began in February, has sent more than 275,000 people fleeing
and claimed hundreds of lives. It has also caused world alarm over
the humanitarian situation of the estimated 50,000 unsheltered
refugees as winter approaches.
	   It was not clear who shot at Hamiti. The attack came only days
after another Rugova aide, the ``defense minister'' in the ethnic
Albanian self-proclaimed government in Kosovo, Ahmet Krasniqi, was
shot and killed in neighboring Albania.
	   With the attack on Hamiti, hard-line factions among the ethnic
Albanians may be warning Rugova to reject any deal with the
government of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, who launched a
crackdown in February against the separatist rebels. Milosevic
stripped Kosovo of its autonomy in 1989 and has since ruled the
majority ethnic Albanian province with an iron grip.
	   Most ethnic Albanians want independence for Kosovo. The West and
Serbia, the dominant republic in the Yugoslav federation, rule out
independence for the majority ethnic Albanian province.
	   There have been signs that Rugova and Milosevic could sign a
U.S.-backed agreement that would give Kosovo a degree of self-rule
but would leave it part of Serbia.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army, which has been fighting for
independence for Kosovo, has pledged to ``punish'' anyone who gives
up the goal of independence.
	   But the militants, who earlier this year controlled 40 percent
of Kosovo, have been largely defeated by Serbian police and the
Yugoslav army after seven months of fighting.
	   Serb sources in Pristina said Friday that the government forces
had ended the latest offensive in the Cicavica mountain, northwest
of Pristina, and rooted out the rebels. A mop-up operation was
underway, they said, indicating lower-level fighting was
continuing.
	   Fighting continued Friday in the central Drenica region after
Serb forces killed seven men, according to the Council for Defense
of Human Rights and Freedoms.
	   The ethnic Albanian human rights group, based in Pristina,
claimed Serbs were separating Albanian from their famlies and
detaining the men.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources also claimed that 30,000 refugees _
mostly women, children and elderly, many of them wounded _ were
concentrated in the village of Brusnik, on the eastern side of the
Cicavica mountain.

Turkish foreign minister defends alliance with Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Turkey will not reshape its foreign policy
just to appease Arabs who feel threatened by its military
agreements with Israel, Turkey's foreign minister said in an
interview published Friday.
	   The Turkish-Israeli military cooperation agreements and Turkey's
relations with Israel are ``not aimed at any country or group of
countries,'' Foreign Minister Ismail Cem was quoted as saying by
the Arabic daily Al-Hayat.
	   Cem's comments came in response to accusations by Arab countries
that the Israeli-Turkish military alliance will undermine stability
in the region. Syria, Iran and Iraq believe the alliance, which
allows for joint military maneuvers, poses a danger to Arab
countries.
	   The cooperation agreements, signed in 1996, include military
maneuvers and defense production accords. Israeli jets are also
able to train in Turkish air space.
	   The London-based Al-Hayat quoted Cem as saying that Turkey is
also attempting to boost its relations with the Arab world.
	   But he stressed that ``Turkey does not accept ... restricting
its relations with Israel (just) to appease the Arab world.''
Likewise, Turkey will not ``limit our relations and our strategy
for boosting our ties to the Arab world in order to please
Israel.''
	   Cem noted some Israelis have objected to Turkey's attempts to
improve ties with Arab states.
	   Israel radio said Friday that Israel will undertake a
three-year, dlrs 70 million project to upgrade 48 Turkish air force
F-5 training planes. Another deal to upgrade 54 Turkish air force
Phantom jet fighters has already been signed between the two
countries.
	   Turkey and Israel are scheduled to hold naval rescue exercises
in November _ their second joint naval maneuvers. Egypt and Jordan
were invited to participate. Egypt has declined, and Jordan said it
would only come to observe the exercise in the Mediterranean.

IMF team wraps up visit, but no sign of loan money

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Despite Russia's pleas for cash, an International
Monetary Fund team wrapped up a visit Friday without recommending
that Moscow receive the next installment of a dlrs 22.6 billion
loan package.
	   Russia badly wants the money to help stabilize an economy
wracked by surging inflation, rising unemployment and a falling
currency. But the IMF team left without agreeing to release
additional money and will return for further negotiations on Oct.
12, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   ``We have to reach some decisions by the end of October,''
Alexander Mozhin, the IMF's acting director for Russia, was quoted
as saying by the Interfax news agency.
	   Russia signed the loan agreement with the IMF and other
international lenders in July, and shortly thereafter received the
first installment from the IMF, worth dlrs 4.8 billion. However,
that did not prevent Russia from sliding into a full-fledged crisis
last month.
	   Russia has been hoping for another dlrs 4.3 billion from the IMF
by the end of September. But the IMF has said it doesn't intend to
release more money to Russia until it's satisfied that the country
has sound economic policies in place.
	   ``Reaching an agreement between the IMF and Russia is important
for both of us,'' the head of the Russian delegation, Deputy Prime
Minister Alexander Shokhin, said Friday. ``Today we need such
support very much.''

Rushdie celebrates end of 'terrorist threat' from Iran
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: adds more comment from Rushdie, Foreign Office, British
Airways &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-UN-Iran-Rushdie &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Salman Rushdie on Friday celebrated ``the end of a
dreadful terrorist threat against a citizen of another country''
and said he was not seeking apologies from those who forced him
into hiding for nearly a decade.
	   ``The reason we have been able to fight this campaign is because
the issue has been kept alive, not just because someone's life was
in danger, but because it was an important battle that we were
fighting for _ freedom of the imagination and the right of free
speech,'' Rushdie told a news conference.
	   Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi announced in New York
Thursday that his country would distance itself from a dlrs 2.5
million reward for killing Rushdie, who was accused of insulting
Islam in his novel, ``The Satanic Verses.''
	   Rushdie said he would not apologize for writing the book.
	   ``I could ask for apologies. I've had 10 years of my life
deformed by this. I've had friends of mine threatened, I've had my
family frightened, messed around with, I've had people that I care
about shot and killed. I could ask for apologies. I'm not doing so.
I think all that's nonsense.
	   ``I would say get over it.''
	   Rushdie said he had no regrets about writing the book.
	   ``'The Satanic Verses' is as important in my body of work as any
of my other books. I cannot imagine my body of work without it
there, in the sense that I am content with the book that I wrote,''
he said.
	   However, Rushdie said he was ``sorrowful for all the people who
have died in demonstrations against 'The Satanic Verses,'
particularly in the subcontinent _ indeed I feel in many cases they
did not even know what they were demonstrating against.''
	   The writer said he had been particularly hurt when India, his
native country, had banned the book and turned against him.
	   ``I have not been permitted at any time to be in the country of
my birth, the country that has been the inspiration of my works. I
am not able to get a visa to travel to India. That has been a
matter of great grief and pain to me.''
	   Rushdie confessed that he had lied in 1990 when, in an effort to
have the Iranian fatwa rescinded, he publicly declared that he had
``embraced Islam.'' Although raised in a Muslim family, Rushdie
said he was not a religious person and that the 1990 statement was
a low point in his ordeal.
	   Asked by a reporter if he is a Muslim now, Rushdie replied: ``I
am happy to say that I am not.''
	   Rushdie said the threat of assassination had been ``very real,''
and that a number of Iranians had been expelled from Britain over
the years because they were suspected of stalking him.
	   However, he added: ``Nobody got very close.''
	   ``I feel there is a small, continued need for caution, but of
the sort faced by many people who, for whatever reason, become
prominent. In the modern world there are cranks who come out of the
woodwork and attack such figures,'' he said.
	   ``But this can be dealt with without the colossal apparatus of
state protection.''
	   Earlier, Foreign Office Minister Derek Fatchett said there had
been two significant gestures which led up to the agreement on
Rushdie. One was an Iranian statement expressing sympathy to the
victims of a terrorist bombing in Omagh, Northern Ireland on Aug.
15, and a British statement condemning the murder of Iranian
diplomats in Afghanistan.
	   Fatchett said diplomatic contacts with Iran would now focus on
the international drugs trade and the situations in Afghanistan and
Iraq.
	   Another key goal, he said, would be to try to ``overcome the
dangerous development of the last decade, the notion that there is
inevitably a clash between the cultures of Christianity and
Islam''.
	   Despite the diplomatic breakthrough, British Airways said Friday
that it would continue its refusal to allow Rushdie aboard its
aircraft.
	   ``While we have every sympathy with Mr. Rushdie's difficulty
with overseas travel, our No. 1 priority is the safety of our
passengers and staff,'' said BA spokesman Bruce Tobin. Tobin would
not elaborate.

Report: Japan's Mars probe in planned lunar orbit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's first interplanetary probe settled into a
steady lunar orbit Friday after a test of a technique that will be
used to hurl the craft toward Mars later this year, a news report
said.
	   The unmanned Planet-B spacecraft was approaching the moon on
Thursday when it made a 40-degree turn, using the moon's
gravitational field to sling itself into a lunar orbit, Kyodo News
agency reported.
	   The technique, called a ``flyby,'' uses the gravitation pull of
moons or planets to increase the speed of spacecraft.
	   The half-ton Japanese craft, launched in July from southern
Japan, will execute	   The another flyby of the moon on Dec. 18 before taking a big
swing around the earth to hurtle itself toward Mars.
	   After the Thursday maneuver, 1.7 million kilometers (1.1 million
miles) from Earth, the probe took pictures of the lunar surface to
test equipment that will be used to photograph Mars.
	   The spacecraft is scheduled to begin beaming back photographs
and experimental data from Mars in October 1999.
	   Japan is only the third nation after the United States and
Russia to have attempted an interplanetary space mission.
	   Unlike the United States' Mars Pathfinder mission, which
broadcast dramatic images from the Martian surface, the Japanese
probe will conduct experiments from orbit around the planet.
	   The probe will examine the Martian atmosphere, photograph the
planet's sand storms, and use high-frequency pulses to search for
traces of water beneath its surface.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Belgium's government plunged into
crisis Friday after the interior minister offered to resign over
the police's role in the death of a Nigerian woman who had become a
symbol for opponents of Belgium's asylum policy.
	   Socialist minister Louis Tobback, a key player in efforts to
reform the embattled police forces and judiciary, offered to resign
late Thursday, but the center-left government asked him to
reconsider Friday.
	   ``The cabinet is convinced that the resignation of the minister
is not the right way to take political responsibility,'' said a
government statement. ``The cabinet insists that Minister Tobback
reconsiders.'' Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene held talks with
Tobback after the cabinet meeting.
	   The coalition was trying to keep Tobback, who is also a
vice-premier, on the job since several important issue had to be
dealt with over the coming months.
	   ``I hope he can still change his mind. He is very important
within the government,'' said Justice Minister Tony Van Parys, a
Christian Democrat, at Friday's weekly Cabinet session.
	   Semira Adamu, 20, died in a Brussels hospital Tuesday from a
brain hemorrhage, hours after police had stuffed a pillow over her
mouth to restrain her on a plane that was about to depart for
Africa.
	   Tobback's decision came after he learned that one of the two
policemen who had tried to subdue Adamu had already been punished
by the police force last year for repeatedly kicking an asylum
seeker.
	   Tobback, who is responsible for the police force, said his
resignation offer was based on the fact that ``a policeman who had
been sanctioned for serious offenses against a deportee was allowed
to be within the division and told to carry out this delicate
task.''
	   But the cabinet said the tragic death of the woman was not his
personal mistake, allowing him to continue on the job.
	   The police officer in question was not allowed on deportation
duty for seven months after the January 1997 incident.
	   After he was reintegrated in the service, he was always
supervised and videotaped during deportation operations. Police
spokeswoman Els Cleemput pointed out he was not the man holding the
pillow on Adamu's face.
	   Protesters called for Tobback's resignation for three straight
days.
	   It was the second time in five months the interior minister had
to resign. Another Socialist, Johan Vande Lanotte, stepped down
after the key suspect in a pedophile case that has gripped
Belgians, Marc Dutroux, briefly escaped.
	   Tobback, 60, had been interior minister from 1988 to 1994. He
was mayor of the university town of Leuven when Vande Lanotte's
resignation forced him back into national politics.
	   The government Thursday suspended the deportation of asylum
seekers from Brussels international airport until new measures were
approved.
	   Adamu had resisted deportation five previous times and her story
had touched a nerve in the nation.
	   She resisted returning to Nigeria because she claimed her family
was forcing her to marry a 65-year-old man who already has three
wives. Belgium argued that was not sufficient to grant her refugee
status.
	   Cleemput said a pillow to subdue deportees was only used twice
last year. But this year resistance from deportees had increased
and the police had to use the practice a dozen times already.

Schools start in Iraq, up to one million children without desks
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Some 4.5 million Iraqi children return to
school next week, but up to a million of them may have to sit on
the floor for lack of desks.
	   Many students also spend the year reading textbooks which have
been recycled for years and sit in classrooms without blackboards
or other teaching aids.
	   The picture emerges from articles in state-run newspapers,
interviews with officials and visits Friday to Baghdad schools.
	   ``The current difficulties of the education sector are, we
think, tragic,'' Eric Falt, spokesman for U.N. humanitarian
programs in Iraq, said when asked Thursday about Iraqi schools.
	   Education is free and compulsory in Iraq. But the government,
blaming eight years of U.N. trade sanctions, says it can no longer
furnish schools with basic requirements.
	   State-run newspapers, quoting senior education officials, said
more than 300,000 new school desks are needed immediately _ many of
those the type that seat several students in rows, thus meaning
many more than 300,000 will be without seats.
	   The papers said at least 8,000 schools need urgent
rehabilitation and 5,000 more must be built to cope with the rising
numbers of students.
	   At a primary school in Baghdad, some classrooms had no doors and
glass was broken in many windows.
	   The school's headmaster, who asked that his name and that of his
school not be revealed, said most of the 2,000 pupils at the school
were born after August 1990 and had little understanding of the
U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
	   It was Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 that prompted
the United Nations to impose sweeping sanctions that block the sale
of most Iraqi oil, the country's economic mainstay. While Iraq
blames the sanctions for many of its ills, Western officials say
more public funds could have been put to humanitarian purposes.
	   The school headmaster complained that he did not have the money
to buy chalk, paper or pens. He said as headmaster he receives just
6,000 Iraqi dinars per month (dlrs 3), since salaries have never
been adjusted for massive depreciation of the dinar.
	   Several teachers said they would not report to work this year
because they believed their 3,000 dinar monthly salary did not even
cover transport fees.
	   Iraq has allocated dlrs 100 million for the education sector
under the current phase of oil-for-food deal. But Falt said the sum
will have to be slashed in light of a drastic reduction in the
projected oil revenues.
	   ``The devastation of the Iraqi educational system requires much
more than the current (oil) program allows,'' said Denis Halliday,
the U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Iraq.

Spanish airliner crashes in Morocco, killing 38

wreckage was not part of rescue mission. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A Spanish airliner crashed Friday into a
northern Moroccan hillside and broke into pieces, killing all 38
people aboard.
	   Rescue workers have recovered 19 bodies so far, said an official
of the regional government in Melilla, a tiny Spanish enclave on
Morocco's Mediterranean coast.
	   The plane was carrying 34 passengers and four crew members to
Melilla from the southern port city of Malaga. It went down in
Moroccan territory about 18 kilometers (11 miles) north of Melilla
as it approached for landing.
	   The cause of the accident was not known, although visibility at
the airport was said to be poor.
	   ``It appears the plane crashed into a hilltop and broke into
pieces,'' said Melilla's regional government chief, Enrique
Palacios, who is also the city's mayor.
	   The majority of the passengers were Spaniards although it is
believed there were several Moroccans aboard, the state news agency
Efe said.
	   Spanish ambulances are helping with rescue efforts.
	   The 86-seat, British-built BAE 146 belonged to the Spanish
charter airline Pauknair, which specializes in flights between
Melilla and cities in Spain proper. The airline runs 55 of the
30-minute flights between Melilla and Malaga each week.
	   The wreckage of the plane that crashed Friday was spotted by a
Spanish air force plane carrying out maneuvers.
	   The plane left Malaga on Friday morning and crashed in a rugged
area called Cap des Trois Fourches.
	   It was the first serious air crash involving a Spanish airline
in more than 13 years. A Madrid-bound Boeing 727 of the state
carrier Iberia hit a television antenna on top of a hill in the
northern city of Bilboa, killing 148 people.
	   The world's deadliest aviation disaster occured on March 27,
1977 in Spain's Canary Islands. A KLM jetliner crashed into a Pan
American jumbo jet on the runway of Tenerife airport, killing 585
people.

Aide to ethnic Albanian leader seriously wounded in attack

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A close aide of Kosovo's ethnic
Albanian leader has been seriously wounded in an attack that could
be a warning to the pacifist Ibrahim Rugova to demand nothing less
than independence for the restive Serbian province.
	   Sabri Hamiti was attacked late Thursday in front of his house in
a suburb of Pristina, the provincial capital, sources close to
Rugova said Friday. Two bullets lodged just above his heart and one
broke his arm. Hamiti was taken to a Pristina hospital.
	   Hamiti, 50, is believed to be the closest aide of Rugova, who
favors political negotiation to resolve the conflict between
separatist rebels and the Serbian government. The main ethnic
Albanian political leader in Kosovo, Rugova has been open to
accepting a peace agreement for the Serbian province that would
fall short of independence.
	   At a press conference Friday, a visibly shaken Rugova said
``this was an attack on Kosovo institutions and prominent public
figures, not only in Kosovo, but in the whole region.''
	   He said the attack ``only further destabilizes the situation in
Kosovo and the whole region.''
	   The Serb crackdown against ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo,
which began in February, has sent more than 275,000 people fleeing
and claimed hundreds of lives. It has also caused world alarm over
the humanitarian situation of the estimated 50,000 unsheltered
refugees as winter approaches.
	   It was not clear who shot at Hamiti. The attack came only days
after another Rugova aide, the ``defense minister'' in the ethnic
Albanian self-proclaimed government in Kosovo, Ahmet Krasniqi, was
shot and killed in neighboring Albania.
	   With the attack on Hamiti, hard-line factions among the ethnic
Albanians may be warning Rugova to reject any deal with the
government of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, who launched a
crackdown in February against the separatist rebels. Milosevic
stripped Kosovo of its autonomy in 1989 and has since ruled the
majority ethnic Albanian province with an iron grip.
	   Most ethnic Albanians want independence for Kosovo. The West and
Serbia, the dominant republic in the Yugoslav federation, rule out
independence for the majority ethnic Albanian province.
	   There have been signs that Rugova and Milosevic could sign a
U.S.-backed agreement that would give Kosovo a degree of self-rule
but would leave it part of Serbia.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army, which has been fighting for
independence for Kosovo, has pledged to ``punish'' anyone who gives
up the goal of independence.
	   But the militants, who earlier this year controlled 40 percent
of Kosovo, have been largely defeated by Serbian police and the
Yugoslav army after seven months of fighting.
	   Serb sources in Pristina said Friday that the government forces
had ended the latest offensive in the Cicavica mountain, northwest
of Pristina, and rooted out the rebels. A mop-up operation was
underway, they said, indicating lower-level fighting was
continuing.
	   But ethnic Albanian reports said intense clashes continued in
the central Drenica region. Reporters southwest of Pristina saw
several villages burning and heard artillery fire at 10-second
intervals, as well as bursts of heavy machine-gun fire.
	   An ethnic Albanian human rights group claimed Serb forces killed
seven men Thursday evening. The Council for Defense of Human Rights
and Freedoms, based in Pristina, also said Serbs were separating
Albanian men from their families and detaining them.

Zhirinovsky plans to run for regional governor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's flamboyant ultranationalist leader
Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who once threatened to annex Finland, Poland
and Alaska if he came to power, announced plans Friday to run for
governor of the region around St. Petersburg, Russian news agencies
reported.
	   Zhirinovsky, who currently heads the third-largest faction in
the Russian parliament, said he was sure of his victory and
promised to make the Leningrad region around St. Petersburg,
Russia's second-largest city, the most economically advanced in
Russia, the Interfax news agency reported. The region borders on
Finland.
	   The seat of governor has been vacant since the former regional
chief, Vadim Gustov, was appointed to the Cabinet this week. No
date for the election has yet been set.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Belgium's government plunged into
crisis Friday after the interior minister offered to resign over
the police's role in the death of a Nigerian woman who had become a
symbol for opponents of Belgium's asylum policy.
	   Socialist minister Louis Tobback, a key player in efforts to
reform the embattled police forces and judiciary, offered to resign
late Thursday, but the center-left government asked him to
reconsider Friday.
	   ``The Cabinet is convinced that the resignation of the minister
is not the right way to take political responsibility,'' said a
government statement. ``The cabinet insists that Minister Tobback
reconsider.''
	   Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene held talks with Tobback, who is
also a vice-premier, after Friday's weekly Cabinet meeting.
	   ``I hope he can still change his mind. He is very important
within the government,'' said Justice Minister Tony Van Parys, a
Christian Democrat.
	   Semira Adamu, 20, died Tuesday in a Brussels hospital from a
brain hemorrhage, hours after police had stuffed a pillow over her
mouth to restrain her on a plane that was about to depart for
Africa.
	   Tobback's offer to resign came after he learned that one of the
two policemen who had tried to subdue Adamu had already been
punished by the police force last year for repeatedly kicking an
asylum seeker.
	   Tobback, who is responsible for the police force, said his
resignation offer was based on the fact that ``a policeman who had
been sanctioned for serious offenses against a deportee was allowed
to be within the division and told to carry out this delicate
task.''
	   But the Cabinet said the tragic death of the woman was not
Tobback's personal mistake, allowing him to continue on the job.
	   The police officer in question was not allowed on deportation
duty for seven months after the January 1997 incident.
	   After he was reintegrated in the service, he was always
supervised and videotaped during deportation operations. Police
spokeswoman Els Cleemput pointed out he was not the man holding the
pillow on Adamu's face.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks tumbled on Wall Street on Friday
extending a global selloff and pushing the Dow industrials below
8,000, on worries about the growing damage from economic crises in
Asia and Russia.
	   Traders were unnerved this week by the dlrs 3.5 billion private
bailout of a major hedge fund. Adding to the anxiety was the
disclosure from United Bank of Switzerland that market turmoil had
left it with huge losses this quarter. There are worries about
where the next flashpoint would emerge.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, which fell 152.42 on Thursday,
dropped an additional 110.45 to 7,891.54 in the early going Friday.
The combined losses more than wiped out the 257.21-point surge of
Wednesday, when Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan signaled
interest rate cuts are likely.
	   Broader market indicators also were adding to Thursday's losses.
	   In Asia, the key market indicator dropped 3.4 percent in Tokyo,
where traders also are upset by a political dispute over
legislation to rescue Japan's ailing financial system. Shares also
fell 1.7 percent in Hong Kong.
	   In London, Europe's biggest stock market, the main index was
down 2.1 percent in afternoon trading. The key index was down 3.1
percent in Paris and 2.7 percent in Frankfurt, Germany.
	   Much of the uncertainty resulted from the near-collapse of
Long-Term Capital Management LP, a business known as a hedge fund

	   The Federal Reserve Bank of New York on Wednesday orchestrated a
bailout by a consortium of banks and brokerage firms because of
concern that the failure of Long-Term Capital would jeopardize the
U.S. financial system. The fund had more than dlrs 90 billion
invested in complex bets in financial markets around the world.
	   The rescue has generated fears that more losses are possible at
other financial institutions, traders said.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks tumbled on Wall Street on Friday
extending a global selloff and pushing the Dow industrials below
8,000, on worries about the growing damage from economic crises in
Asia and Russia.
	   Traders were unnerved this week by the dlrs 3.5 billion private
bailout of a major hedge fund. Adding to the anxiety was the
disclosure from United Bank of Switzerland that market turmoil had
left it with huge losses this quarter. There are worries about
where the next flashpoint would emerge.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, which fell 152.42 on Thursday,
dropped an additional 110.45 to 7,891.54 in the early going Friday.
The combined losses more than wiped out the 257.21-point surge of
Wednesday, when Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan signaled
interest rate cuts are likely.
	   Broader market indicators also were adding to Thursday's losses.
	   In Asia, the key market indicator dropped 3.4 percent in Tokyo,
where traders also are upset by a political dispute over
legislation to rescue Japan's ailing financial system. Shares also
fell 1.7 percent in Hong Kong.
	   In London, Europe's biggest stock market, the main index was
down 2.1 percent in afternoon trading. The key index was down 3.1
percent in Paris and 2.7 percent in Frankfurt, Germany.
	   Much of the uncertainty resulted from the near-collapse of
Long-Term Capital Management LP, a business known as a hedge fund
that manages investments for the wealthy.
	   The Federal Reserve Bank of New York on Wednesday orchestrated a
bailout by a consortium of banks and brokerage firms because of
concern that the failure of Long-Term Capital would jeopardize the
U.S. financial system. The fund had more than dlrs 90 billion
invested in complex bets in financial markets around the world.
	   The rescue has generated fears that more losses are possible at
other financial institutions, traders said.

Needing to use bathroom, politician felt treed by reporters

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Although he had a fierce need to
visit the restroom, politician Uffe Ellemann-Jensen didn't want to
leak any information to the reporters standing outside his office
door.
	   So he turned for relief to a potted plant in his inner sanctum,
he reveals in newly published memoirs.
	   The anecdote got wide attention in Danish media. But although
it's a case of a politician with unzipped trousers, it's unlikely
to provoke a scandal. Ellemann-Jensen asked all the women to leave
the room first, he says.
	   The incident occurred after voting closed in national elections
on March 11. The Liberal Party, led by Ellemann-Jensen, and the
Social Democrat Party of Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen were
neck-and-neck as the returns poured in.
	   TV reporters camped outside both politicians' offices, waylaying
anyone who walked out for comment.
	   ``The moment I opened the door I would be live on the television
channels and I couldn't just say that I was on my way to the
bathroom,'' Ellemann-Jensen wrote.
	   ``There wasn't anything else to do but ask the women to leave my
office'' and relieve himself on the plant, he said.
	   Ellemann-Jensen stepped down after his party lost the election.
He told Denmark's TV2 channel Thursday that he took the plant along
when he moved out of the office. ``I now have it at home and it's
doing fine.''

Schools start in Iraq, up to one million children without desks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo BAG101 &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Some 4.5 million Iraqi children return to
school next week, but up to a million of them may have to sit on
the floor for lack of desks.
	   Many students also spend the year reading textbooks which have
been recycled for years and sit in classrooms without blackboards
or other teaching aids.
	   The picture emerges from articles in state-run newspapers,
interviews with officials and visits Friday to Baghdad schools.
	   ``The current difficulties of the education sector are, we
think, tragic,'' Eric Falt, spokesman for U.N. humanitarian
programs in Iraq, said when asked Thursday about Iraqi schools.
	   Education is free and compulsory in Iraq. But the government,
blaming eight years of U.N. trade sanctions, says it can no longer
furnish schools with basic requirements.
	   It was Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 that prompted
the United Nations to impose sweeping sanctions that block the sale
of most Iraqi oil, the country's economic mainstay. While Iraq
blames the sanctions for many of its ills, Western officials say
more public funds could have been put to humanitarian purposes.
	   State-run newspapers, quoting senior education officials, said
more than 300,000 new school desks are needed immediately _ many of
those the type that seat several students in rows, thus meaning
many more than 300,000 will be without seats.
	   The papers said at least 8,000 schools need urgent
rehabilitation and 5,000 more must be built to cope with the rising
numbers of students.
	   At a primary school in Baghdad, some classrooms had no doors and
glass was broken in many windows.
	   The school's headmaster, who asked that his name and that of his
school not be revealed, said most of the 2,000 pupils at the school
were born after August 1990 and had little understanding of the
U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
	   The school headmaster complained that he did not have the money
to buy chalk, paper or pens. He said as headmaster he receives just
6,000 Iraqi dinars per month (dlrs 3), since salaries have never
been adjusted for massive depreciation of the dinar.
	   Several teachers said they would not report to work this year
because they believed their 3,000 dinar monthly salary did not even
cover transport fees.
	   Iraq has allocated dlrs 100 million for the education sector
under the current phase of oil-for-food deal. But Falt said the sum
will have to be slashed in light of a drastic reduction in the
projected oil revenues.
	   ``The devastation of the Iraqi educational system requires much
more than the current (oil) program allows,'' said Denis Halliday,
the U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Iraq.

Hide focused on the Fischer bout
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NORWICH, England (AP) _ Herbie Hide defends his WBO world
heavyweight title against German challenger Willi Fisher on
Saturday intent on forcing two outcomes.
	   One, he'll beat Fischer. Two, he'll prove he's good enough to
share the ring with Lennox Lewis or Evander Holyfield.
	   Hide, whose latest request for a showdown with Lewis was
rejected last week, says he is focused only on beating Fischer. But
his worth as a genuine heavyweight contender is on the line _
again.
	   The WBO title fight is being overshadowed by Lewis's defense of
his WBC title against Croatia's Zeljko Mavrovic at the Mohegan Sun
Casino in Connecticut on the same night.
	   Hide's reputation was tarnished when he was knocked down nine
times by Riddick Bowe before being stopped in the sixth round of a
WBO title defense in 1995.
	   Hide's 30-1-0 record is only blemished by the loss to Bowe but
his opponents have not been world-beaters.
	   In April, Hide's latest fight, he took just 52 seconds to beat
unheralded American Damon Reed in the second defense of his WBO
title.
	   Fischer has lost just once in 23 professional bouts but has only
fought once outside Germany.
	   The German heavyweight outraged Hide after watching him fight
Tony Tucker in June last year.
	   ``Fischer was at ring side...and he said, `If that's all Herbie
Hide's got it will be easy. I'm going to knock him out'.'' Hide
said.
	   ``He doesn't realize I'm vicious and spiteful. I cannot be hurt,
I cannot be defeated. He's in my way and I refuse to lose.''
	   Fischer predicted a good fight at the Norwich Sports Stadium.
	   ``Herbie Hide is a good puncher and he's a quick fighter and I
will certainly need to be at my best,'' he said.

Two Spanish cyclists expelled from Tour of Spain for failing blood

<TEXT>
	   SEGOVIA, Spain (AP) _ Two Spanish cyclists were expelled from
the Tour of Spain on Friday after failing a blood test, the state
news agency Efe reported.
	   Juan Carlos Dominguez and Daniel Clavero of the Vitalicio
Seguros team had an abnormally high number of oxygen-carrying red
blood cells, according to a test administered by the International
Cycling Union prior to the 20th leg of the 22-stage race, the
agency said.
	   The cyclists failed the test because their hematocrit level _
the proportion of red blood cells to the total volume of blood _
was measured as above 50 percent, which is considered a health
risk.
	   The ICU describes the blood test as a safety measure rather than
a doping control.
	   There is no reliable way of detecting the use of EPO, a
synthetic hormone that stimulates the production of oxygen-carrying
red blood cells, although a high red blood cell count can indicate
its use.
	   Clavero was in seventh place in the standings with just three
legs left to go.
	   His coach Javier Minguez said team doctors had tested
Vitalicio's riders on Thursday night and found their hematocrit
level below 50 percent. ``My conscience is clear,'' Minguez said.
	   The expulsion means Clavero and Dominguez will miss next month's
world road championships in Valkenburg, the Netherlands because
they have to wait 15 days to have their blood tested again to see
if the hematocrit level is safe.
	   Other riders tested Friday include Tour of Spain leader Abraham
Olano of Spain and Banesto, Frenchman Laurent Jalabert of
ONCE-Deutsche Bank, who is in second place, and Spaniard Fernando
Escartin of Kelme-Costa Blanca who is fourth.
	   Also tested was two-time defending champion Alex Zuelle, a Swiss
rider with Festina.

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Thousands of Afghans shouted God is
great as a Taliban gunman publicly executed a convicted killer on
Friday.
	   Another man's hand was cut off, the Islamic punishment for
theft.
	   The Taliban shot Attiqullah, 26, who was sentenced to death last
week by an Islamic court for committing a murder.
	   Earlier, Taliban leaders spoke on the concept of Islamic
punishments, saying that they helped to curb crimes.
	   The hard-line Taliban militia, which controls most of
Afghanistan, follows a strict version of Islam that bars women from
work and education, bans music and forces men to wear beards.
	   So far 30 public executions have taken place in Kabul's sports
stadium this year.
	   Ali Shah, who was found guilty of robbery, was given anesthetic
before his hand was cut off by a doctor wearing a surgical mask.

	   OSAKA, Japan (AP) _ Yevgeny Kafelnikov, ranked 10th in the
world, gave Russia a 1-0 lead Friday by beating Japan's Goichi
Motomura 4-6, 6-2, 6-3, 6-3 in a Davis Cup World Group qualifying
tennis round.
	   In the first singles match on the Utsubo Tennis Center's outdoor
hard court, Kafelnikov suffered from early errors and lost the
first set to No. 209 Motomura.
	   But Kafelnikov, winner of singles and doubles titles in the 1996
French Open, began some impressive sharpshooting down the lines in
the second set.
	   The Russian gained further momentum as he survived three break
points and went ahead 4-3 in the third set.
	   The second singles match between 54th-ranked Marat Safin of
Russia and his opponent Takao Suzuki, No. 128 in the world, was
suspended due to rain after Safin won the first set 7-6 (7-4) and
led the second 3-1.
	   The singles match will continue Saturday before a doubles match.
	   The final two singles matches are scheduled for Sunday.
	   Winner of the round will join the elite 16-nation Davis Cup
World Group.

Bangladesh police look for arresting Taslima Nasrin
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo DHA-101 &QL; 
 &UR; By FARID HOSSAIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Armed with an arrest warrant,
Bangladeshi police on Friday were looking for author Taslima
Nasrin, who has been hiding because of death threats from Islamic
extremists who accuse her of blasphemy.
	   A police officer at the station in the Dhaka neighborhood where
Nasrin's apartment is located said on condition of anonymity that
police had received the arrest order issued by a court a day
before.
	   Also on Friday, nearly 2,000 Muslim extremists marched through
the Bangladeshi capital protesting against the author.
	   ``We will never forgive the infidel. We want to see her hanged
in public,'' Fazlul Huq Amini, a leader of the umbrella
organization Islami Oikya Jote which organized the march, thundered
before the slogan-shouting crowd.
	   Plainclothes detectives joined journalists who have been
gathered outside Nasrin's apartment building since it was confirmed
she had slipped back into the country on Sept. 14 after four years
in exile in Europe. But the detectives said it was not clear
whether Nasrin was in her apartment.
	   A Dhaka magistrate on Thursday revived an arrest warrant first
issued in a civil complaint in 1994. Dhaka resident Joynul Abedin
complained Nasrin had attacked Islam in her book ``Nirbachityo
Column,'' or ``Selected Columns,'' a compilation of her newspaper
writings.
	   The magistrate also ordered Nasrin's property be confiscated as
punishment for failing to appear in court.
	   The civil case was in addition to another criminal case that
former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia's government had filed in 1994
accusing Nasrin of blaspheming Islam.
	   She was later freed on bail in the criminal case, and then fled
to Stockholm, Sweden, from where she traveled to other European and
U.S. cities to speak to writers and women's rights groups.
	   Nasrin angered conservative Muslims after a newspaper quoted her
as saying that the Koran, Islam's holy book, should be rewritten.
She denied making the comments, but said she favored changes in
Islamic laws to give women more rights in her male-dominated
society.
	   Her return has provoked street protests and renewal of offers of
a cash reward of 200,000 takas (dlrs 5,000) for anyone who kills
her.
	   Nasrin said from hiding after her arrival she risked her life to
return to be with ``my mother in her last days.'' Her 60-year-old
mother, Eid-ul-Ara Begum, has colon cancer.
	   Her novel ``Lajja'', ``Shame,'' criticized Muslims for attacking
minority Hindus after the destruction of a mosque by Hindu zealots
in neighboring India in 1992. Bangladesh banned the novel, saying
it incited religious discord.
	   Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who replaced Mrs. Zia in 1996, has
shown little interest in pursuing Nasrin's trial, but her liberal
government is now under pressure from the Islamic groups.
	   Even though Bangladesh is a predominantly Muslim country, it is
governed by secular laws. A small group of conservative Muslims
want to introduce Islamic laws.

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Ethiopia has accused Eritrea of
carrying out ethnic cleansing through systematic deportation of
Ethiopians living in Eritrea.
	   ``The Eritrean government seems determined to ethnic cleanse
Ethiopians in Eritrea by systematically but indiscriminately
deporting Ethiopians after making life intolerable for them,''
government spokeswoman Selome Tadesse said in a statement Friday.
	   She said Eritrea had not given any reason for the action and
said some Ethiopians had died in the process. The statement did not
give a figure, and it was not immediately possible to obtain
comment from Eritrean officials.
	   Quoting figures from the Ethiopian Disaster Prevention and
Preparedness Commission, she said 24,970 Ethiopians have been
deported from Eritrea since a border dispute erupted into a brief
but intense shooting war between the two Horn of Africa nations in
May.
	   All attempts to mediate between the two countries have failed. A
delegation headed by former U.S. national security adviser Anthony
Lake is expected in the region this weekend.
	   The Ethiopians say they are glad he is coming; the Eritreans
blame earlier U.S. peace efforts for complicating things.
	   At the beginning of the crisis, Eritrea expelled a few hundred
Ethiopians every week. But Ethiopia says the numbers are growing.
	   Ethiopia expelled another 2,000 Eritreans early this week, most
of them the wives and children of Eritrean nationals expelled
earlier for allegedly raising funds for the Eritreans war effort
and spying for their government.
	   Many of those expelled earlier were successful businessmen who
had to leave everything behind.
	   Ethiopia says it has expelled about 8,000 Eritreans, but Eritrea
puts the figure at 20,000.
	   Political analysts in the Ethiopian capital say the stepped up
war of words and the mass expulsion of each other's nationals can
only lead to renewed fighting between the formerly friendly
neighbors in the Horn of Africa.
	   Both countries settled into a ``no war, no peace'' situation
after three days of bloody ground fighting along their long common
border and air raids against civilians and military targets.
	   A moratorium on fighting brokered by U.S President Bill Clinton
last June is still holding.
	   But in the meantime, both sides have dug in thousands of troops
in trenches and have purchased and moved to the front additional
tanks, artillery, multi-rocket launchers and other weapons.
	   Senior Ethiopian officials have repeatedly declared that all-
out war is inevitable unless Eritrea withdraws its troops from two
contested districts in northwestern Ethiopia they occupied in May.
	   The Organization of African Unity had been expected to discuss
the conflict this week, but an OAU spokesman said the 16 members of
the body's organ on conflict prevention and resolution were still
at the planning stage.

Flooding in Benin, oil company funds university in Congo, x x

<TEXT>
	   COTONOU, Benin (AP) _ Heavy rains and flooding in this West
African country have killed at least five people and left more than
5,500 others homeless, the government said Friday.
	   The worst of the flooding occurred in northern Benin near the
border with Niger. About 570 homes were washed away and hundreds of
others were swamped, according to official figures.
	   Tributaries of the Niger River have swollen with recent weeks of
heavy seasonal rains.
	   -----
	   BRAZZAVILLE, Congo (AP) _ Chevron has granted dlrs 2 million to
the Republic of Congo's main university to help repair damages
incurred during last year's bloody civil war.
	   The money will be used to rebuild dormitories, refurbish the
library and replace teaching materials looted from the Marien
Ngouabi University in Brazzaville, the government said Friday.
	   Other oil companies including Exxon and Elf have contributed to
rehabilitation efforts in the ravaged capital, a government
official said.
	   The Republic of Congo is one of Africa's main oil producers and
derives nearly all its income from petroleum exports.
	   Last year's five-month civil war caused an estimated dlrs 1
billion of damage to this central African nation.
	   -----
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ City authorities said Friday that 14 of
the 18 ambulances that serve the capital Harare are off the road
because the municipal council can't afford the repairs.
	   In a report made available by Mayor Solomon Tawengwa's office,
officials said at least 190 vehicles, including fire trucks, are
laid up because the council needs 3.5 million Zimbabwe dollars
(dlrs 120,000) for repairs and spare parts.
	   ``The suppliers of the much-needed spares are demanding cash up
front,'' it said.
	   About 40 garbage trucks have been out of action for more than a
year, the report said.
	   About two million people live in Harare.

Six dead in heavy rains in western Japan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES number of dead to six from four

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Torrential rains triggered flooding and mudslides
in western Japan on Friday, reportedly killing six people and
flooding thousands of homes.
	   A 16-year-old high school student, Yuta Toyama, drowned after
falling into a manhole while wading through floodwaters in Kochi,
625 kilometers (391 miles) southwest of Tokyo, a spokesman for the
Koichi Prefecture police said.
	   Two 87-year-old women, and an 83-year-old man, also drowned in
floodwaters in or near Kochi, said the police official, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
	   Another woman was found dead after being buried in a mudslide
Friday, Kyodo news agency reported. A sixth person also died in the
storm, Japan's national broadcaster, NHK, reported.
	   Authorities could not be reached late Friday to confirm the two
additional deaths.
	   A total of 874 millimeters (35 inches) of rain fell on the city
of Kochi between Wednesday evening and Friday evening, the
Meteorological Agency said. Three houses were destroyed and more
than 2,200 inundated by floodwaters.

Ethnic zealots in Nigeria behead rival leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ The severed head of a tribal chief was
found floating in a river in southwestern Nigeria hours after he
was abducted by members of a rival group, a newspaper reported
Friday.
	   Assailants from the Ijaw community stormed the palace of
Hailfort Imani, the leader of the rival Ilaje ethnic group and four
other tribal elders, the Vanguard newspaper reported.
	   Imani's head was later found in the river close to his residence
in southwestern Nigeria's Ondo State, witnesses said.
	   Police said they were searching for the four other abducted
elders.
	   Imani, was the traditional head of a sub-Yoruba ethnic group
known as the Ilaje. The Yorubas are one of the largest and most
influential ethnic groups in Nigeria.
	   The death of Imani comes after several days of fighting between
the rival groups. On Wednesday, police said 23 had been killed in
recent days of fighting between opposing groups.
	   The fighting began over disputed land.
	   Security forces trying to quell the unrest have had difficulty
reaching the area, the newspaper reported.
	   Dozens of people were killed last year in similar clashes
between the two groups in nearby Delta State.

Russia warns NATO against force to end Serbian crackdown in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian Foreign Ministry on Friday strongly
warned NATO against using force to end Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic's crackdown against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
	   ``There is no way to solve the Kosovo problem by force,'' the
ministry said in an official statement.
	   It insisted that the U.N. Security Council resolution passed
this week was aimed at solving the Kosovo conflict ``exclusively by
peaceful, political means on the basis of giving broad autonomy to
the region while respecting Yugoslavia's sovereignty and
territorial integrity.''
	   The United States believes the resolution provides a sufficient
mandate to launch a military action against the Serbian forces and
no other U.N. action is needed. However, a number of its allies,
including France, have hesitated.
	   The U.N. resolution ``doesn't sanction the use of force,'' the
Russian Foreign Ministry said, adding that Moscow was ``alarmed''
by what it claimed was NATO's liberal interpretation of the
document.
	   ``Using force without proper international legal backing is
fraught with the dangerous destabilization of the Balkan region and
the most serious negative consequences for the international legal
system,'' it said.
	   The United States and other NATO members have agreed to begin
assembling their firepower to strike targets in Yugoslavia, though
they have set no specific date for an attack.

Death toll soars in Dominican Republic from Hurricane Georges

recovery effort in Puerto Rico and additional indirect death. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Rescue workers coping
with the results of Hurricane Georges' fury have been pulling more
bodies from mud, water, and rubble. At least 250 people died in the
storm that ravaged the Caribbean and now threatens the U.S. state
of Florida.
	   Armed forces chief Ruben Paulino Alvarez said Thursday night
that 125 were known dead in the Dominican Republic, with another
156 missing.
	   The death toll apparently did not include 76 bodies that Red
Cross official Angel Almanzar said were recovered Thursday by
workers in San Juan de la Maguana, 120 miles (190 kilometers) west
of the capital, Santo Domingo.
	   Reporters trying to reach the area were told it was inaccessible
by land because of damaged bridges.
	   In Manomatuey, where a shelter was washed away Wednesday, three
more bodies were pulled from the muck to bring the death toll there
to at least eight. And along the capital's seaside boulevard, a
woman's bloated, blanched body washed ashore.
	   The aftermath appeared as bleak as the storm itself. With an
estimated 90 percent of the country's crops wiped out, food
supplies would not last long, officials warned. Many people
desperately searched for clean water in a country still partially
submerged.
	   Meanwhile, the hurricane continued its onslaught. It struck
southern Cuba on Wednesday, crossed it Thursday and was threatening
the Florida Keys.
	   The death toll also rose Thursday in Haiti, where 42 people are
known to have died.
	   In Cuba, the government reported two people were electrocuted
when they touched live wires downed in the storm, the Mexican news
agency Notimex said. Coffee, cacao and banana crops also were
damaged and nearly 20,000 homes were flooded in eastern Holguin
province.
	   Three people were killed and two were missing in St. Kitts, two
died in Antigua and at least three deaths were attributed to the
storm in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, where officials
estimated damage of at least dlrs 2 billion.
	   Curfews were in effect in St. Kitts and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
In St. Kitts, 85 percent of homes were damaged or destroyed,
schools and hospitals were damaged, and half the crucial sugar crop
was lost. About 2,500 were homeless.
	   In Puerto Rico, the Electric Energy Authority gradually began
restoring power to some neighborhoods. Water service in parts of
the San Juan metropolitan area resumed Friday.
	   Storm victims everywhere struggled to find water, food, ice and
other essentials to cope with loss and the tropical heat.
	   In the town of San Lorenzo, a 67-year-old woman collapsed and
died while waiting in line for an emergency assistance check from
the government. That brought the death toll in Puerto Rico to three
killed directly by the hurricane and nine indirect deaths.
	   ``House after house is in terrible shape,'' U.S. Housing
Secretary Andrew Cuomo said after touring damaged neighborhoods.
	   President Bill Clinton declared Puerto Rico a major disaster
area Monday, making it eligible to about dlrs 340 million in
emergency and other aid.
	   In Haiti, the U.N. Development Program donated dlrs 100,000 for
disaster relief and the U.S. donated water, food, blankets, sheets
and clothing. France sent a 60-member security team to help with
water purification and to treat the injured.
	   Some places in Cite Soleil, a seaside slum in Port-au-Prince
that is home to 200,000 people, remained chin-deep in water. The
number of tin-and-cardboard shacks lost was unknown.
	   In the Dominican Republic, rescuers in helicopters and on the
ground searched frantically for more victims.
	   More than 100,000 people lost homes, said President Leonel
Fernandez. Telephone lines were down throughout the country, and
hundreds of people were isolated by flooding. Airports in La Romana
and Puerto Plata were severely damaged.
	   Throughout Santo Domingo people wandered with empty plastic jugs
searching for water to drink. Many had to settle for filthy brown
river water. ``I'm going to drink it. I know it's bad, but there's
nothing else,'' said Altagracia Duran.
	   The Red Cross prepared to deliver aid to the needy, and army
soldiers patrolled the capital with rifles to deter looting that
surged during the storm. More than 100 people were arrested late
Wednesday and early Thursday for curfew violations, according to
local TV reports.

Russian fighter jet crashes, killing pilot
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new 3 final grafs with statistics, context. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian MiG-29 fighter jet crashed Friday while
on a training flight and the pilot was killed.
	   The crash occurred shortly after the jet had taken off from a
military air base near the city of Chita in central Siberia, about
4700 kilometers (3,000 miles) east of Moscow, the Interfax news
agency reported, citing military officials.
	   There were no casualties or damage on the ground, it said.
	   According to the report, the apparent reason for the crash was
the failure of the plane's engines.
	   The twin-engine MiG-29, which is capable of flying at twice the
speed of sound, is a mainstay of the Russian Air Force. It
generally has been considered a reliable aircraft and few MiG-29
crashes have been reported.
	   Many recent accidents involving Russian military aircraft have
been linked to a severe government funding shortage that makes it
hard for the air force to maintain its fleet and deprives pilots of
regular practice.
	   Only about half of all Russian fighter jets can take to the air,
the rest being grounded for ``technical reasons,'' Interfax said,
quoting air force officials.
	   The average flight time per air crew was 25-30 hours last year,
instead of the minimal norm of 180-200. As a result, 60-70 percent
of all crashes have been caused by pilot errors, the report said.
	   According to Interfax, Friday's was the third air force jet
crash this year. Overall in the last six years, there have been 36
crashes in the air force that killed 276 people, it said.

Hakkinen posts the fastest time in free practice
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NUERBURGRING, Germany (AP) _ Mika Hakkinen bolstered his Formula
One championship hopes when he posted by far the fastest time in
free practice Friday for the Luxembourg Grand Prix.
	   Hakkinen was more than seventh-tenths of a second faster in a
McLaren-Mercedes than his only rival in the battle for the title,
Michael Schumacher. The two drivers are tied on 80 points going
into the penultimate race of the season.
	   With less than a minute remaining in the session, Hakkinen
produced a blistering lap around the 4.556-kilometer (2.831-mile)
circuit in one minute, 19.689 seconds.
	   The Finn had been fourth until he blasted to the top at the end
of the afternoon session.
	   ``We made changes all the way through the sessions today,
finally establishing a good set-up for the race,'' Hakkinen said.
``Qualifying will be very close.''
	   Although the free practice is spent testing various set-ups and
tires and usually has little bearing on the outcome, Hakkinen's
overwhelming performance is certain to give him a psychological
boost.
	   Schumacher dropped to fourth in his Ferrari, 0.772 seconds
behind Hakkinen.
	   ``The McLaren looks strong, as expected, but I am not concerned
about the time difference as I only used one set of tires,''
Schumacher said.
	   Schumacher, a two-time champion with other cars, is seeking to
become the first driver to win the title for Ferrari since Jody
Scheckter in 1979.
	   Giancarlo Fisichella in a Benetton was second, 0.636 seconds
slower than Hakkinen. Outgoing world champion Jacques Villeneuve,
winner of the last two races here, was third in his Williams, 0.637
behind Hakkinen and just one-thousandth of a second behind
Fisichella.
	   Hakkinen's McLaren teammate David Coulthard was fifth, while
Eddie Irvine, the second Ferrari driver, was sixth.
	   The free practice was held in sunshine and mild temperatures,
but the forecast predicts cooler and wetter weather for Sunday's
race and possibly for Saturday's qualifying.
	   Schumacher is acknowledged as a superior driver in wet
conditions. He also knows well the circuit, which is about an
hour's drive away from his hometown of Kerpen.
	   Although the race officially carries the title of Luxembourg
Grand Prix, it takes place across the border in Germany. Schumacher
won here in 1995.
	   Schumacher will also have the support of 140,000 fans expected
to come to the race.
	   While the two McLaren cars dominated the early past of the
season, winning five of six opening races, Schumacher has led a
strong Ferrari comeback.
	   The German has won two of the last three races and comes off a
vintage performance two weeks ago at Monza, Italy, where he led a
1-2 Ferrari triumph.
	   Both Hakkinen and Schumacher have won six races this season, but
the Finn holds an edge under Formula One tie-breaking rules because
he has two second places to Schumacher's one.
	   Unless Hakkinen wins Sunday and Schumacher fails to score a
point, the championship battle will be decided in Japan on Nov. 1,
the last race of the season.
	   Meanwhile, the Stewart-Ford team announced that its Brazilian
driver, Rubens Barrichello, will remain for the 1999 season.
Barrichello will partner British driver Johnny Herbert, who is
moving from Sauber.

Aziz to insist on U.N. initiative for inspections to resume
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz will
insist the United Nations take the first step in ending a standoff
over weapons inspections during his meeting with the U.N.
secretary-general, Iraq's vice president says.
	   Aziz is scheduled to meet Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Monday
at the United Nations in New York. Aziz was instructed to keep a
hard line, Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan said in a statement
carried Friday by the official al-Iraq newspaper.
	   Earlier this month, the Security Council took tough action
against Iraq for freezing weapons inspections, suspending periodic
review of sanctions that have crippled Iraq's economy.
	   The action left Baghdad with little room to press for the easing
of sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   But the council agreed to conduct a ``comprehensive review'' of
sanctions after Iraq lets U.N. inspectors go back to work. Such a
move could force the council to acknowledge Iraq's progress in
ridding itself of weapons of mass destruction while generating
pressure for a lifting of sanctions.
	   Iraq, however, has insisted the review take place first.
	   Ramadan said Aziz was told to convey the message that Iraq will
make no changes in its position unless the United Nations ``accepts
a comprehensive and fair evaluation'' to have the embargo removed.

Needing to use bathroom, politician felt treed by reporters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Although he had a fierce need to
visit the restroom, politician Uffe Ellemann-Jensen didn't want to
leak any information to the reporters camped outside his office
door.
	   So he turned for relief to a potted plant in his inner sanctum,
he reveals in newly published memoirs.
	   The anecdote has received wide attention in Danish media. But
although it's a case of a politician with unzipped trousers, it's
unlikely to provoke a scandal. Ellemann-Jensen asked all the women
to leave the room first, he said.
	   The incident occurred after voting closed in national elections
on March 11. The Liberal Party, led by Ellemann-Jensen, and the
Social Democrat Party of Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen were
neck-and-neck as the returns poured in.
	   TV reporters camped outside both politicians' offices, waylaying
anyone who walked out for comment.
	   ``The moment I opened the door I would be live on the television
channels and I couldn't just say that I was on my way to the
bathroom,'' Ellemann-Jensen wrote.
	   ``There wasn't anything else to do but ask the women to leave my
office'' and urinate on the plant, he said.
	   Ellemann-Jensen stepped down after his party lost the election.
He told Denmark's TV2 channel Thursday that he took the plant along
when he moved out of the office. ``I now have it at home and it's
doing fine.''

Rusedski wins 11-9 in fifth set to give Britain 1-0 lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NOTTINGHAM, England (AP) _ Greg Rusedski saved a match point in
the fifth set and survived a marathon Friday against Leander Paes
to give Britain a 1-0 lead over India in a Davis Cup World Group
qualifying round tie.
	   Rusedski repeatedly battled from behind in the final set to
prevail 2-6, 6-3, 3-6, 6-2, 11-9 in three hours, 16 minutes.
	   Paes twice served for the match at 5-4 and 6-5. But Rusedski
broke back each time, saving a match point in the 12th game with a
backhand service return which clipped the netcord and dropped at
the Indian's feet.
	   Rusedski got in trouble again on his own serve, going down 0-40
at 6-6 and 15-40 at 7-7. But he again fought back to hold.
	   Rusedski led 10-9 when he broke Paes to close out the match. At
15-40, Paes saved the first match point with a forehand passing
shot. But he double faulted on the second to end the match.
	   Tim Henman faced Mahesh Bhupathi in the second singles match
later Friday.
	   Paes and Bhupathi, the world's third-ranked doubles team, face
Henman and Rusedski in Saturday's doubles. The reverse singles are
Sunday.
	   The winner of the tie will advance to the elite 16-team World
Group. Britain hasn't played in the World Group since 1992.

budget
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with budget sticking to deficit targets &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's center-left government braced for a battle
with its hard-line Communist allies Friday after it unveiled a 1999
budget that sticks to deficit cutting targets promised to European
partners despite a slowdown in economic growth.
	   In the budget it is sending to parliament, the deficit target
remains at 2 percent of gross domestic product despite new
forecasts that GDP growth this year will be 1.8 percent instead of
the 2.5 percent predicted last spring.
	   Italy's Communist Refoundation Party is divided over whether to
back the budget, but hard-liners who say it doesn't do enough to
create jobs are expected to prevail when the party takes a strategy
vote next week.

Fugitive accused of selling nuclear secrets to Iraq surrenders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from defense lawyer &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ A German engineer accused of treason for selling
secret nuclear technology to Iraq was ordered jailed Friday, a day
after he returned home from Brazil and gave himself up so that he
could visit his terminally ill mother.
	   Karl-Heinz Schaab, a fugitive since January 1996, was arrested
at Frankfurt airport Thursday after arriving on a Lufthansa flight
from Sao Paulo, Brazil.
	   Federal prosecutor Kay Nehm said Schaab, who has been under
investigation for treason since 1995, is suspected of helping Iraq
produce weapons-grade uranium in 1989-90.
	   The 64-year-old engineer allegedly sold Iraq secret construction
plans for a uranium enrichment plant for 2 million marks (dlrs 1.2
million). The plans were found by U.N. inspectors in Iraq.
	   Schaab, who plans to make at least a partial confession, denies
the information he provided was ``secret enough to justify this
serious charge of treason,'' his lawyer, Michael Rietz, said in a
telephone interview.
	   While admitting he bears ``moral guilt'' for helping Iraq with
what he saw at first as a ``technical challenge,'' Schaab also
insists others were involved and his own role was ``minimal,''
Rietz said.
	   ``The Iraqis didn't just run around and ask him, `Will you help
us develop our atomic weapons program?''' Rietz said. But by the
time Schaab realized what they were up to, ``he was maybe in too
deep.''
	   He said Schaab's firm also was having financial problems at the
time and Schaab needed money.
	   Schaab, who was placed on probation after a 1993 conviction for
violating export laws, disappeared from his home in the Bavarian
town of Kaufbeuren in January 1996.
	   He was arrested in December that year in Rio de Janeiro while
reportedly trying to obtain a permanent visa, but released after 15
months in custody when Brazil's supreme court rejected Germany's
extradition request.
	   Early this year Schaab began negotiating his return, partly
because he wanted to visit his 96-year-old mother, who is
terminally ill.
	   The two spent two and a half hours together Thursday before
Schaab was brought by BMW limousine to a Bavarian prison, Rietz
said.
	   Schaab appeared in court Friday in Munich and was ordered held
pending further proceedings.
	   In a 1996 interview with Der Spiegel newsmagazine, Schaab
admitted providing technical information to Iraq, but said at least
four other German nuclear experts also were involved in helping to
set up the uranium enrichment plant.
	   The magazine quoted Schaab as saying secret documents were
``insufficiently secured by his former employer,'' the Munich-based
MAN company, which produces heavy machinery.
	   Rietz also said Schaab was convinced the Iraqis would never be
in a position to manage an enrichment program for weapons-grade
uranium.
	   Inspectors who assessed Iraq's nuclear program after the 1991
Gulf War war found that Iraq was one or two years away from
building a bomb.

NATO increases pressure on Milosevic to end Kosovo crackdown
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Solana response to Milosevic in grafs 7-9 and
possibility of an ultimatum in graf 12. Pickup 9th graf pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY HATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VILAMOURA, Portugal (AP) _ NATO is threatening to launch air
strikes and cruise missile attacks on Slobodan Milosevic unless the
Serbian leader ends his crackdown in the Kosovo province _ and ends
it quickly.
	   Still unclear, however, is whether the U.N. Security Council's
tough resolution is a sufficient mandate for military action
against Yugoslavia or if a further U.N. decision is required.
	   The United States believes nothing more is necessary. France
said Friday that the issue was not so clear.
	   In the days ahead, each of the 16 NATO members will say if and
how they can contribute to an air campaign to check the crackdown
against ethnic Albanian rebels demanding independence in the
southern Serbian province. The offensive, which began in February,
has left hundreds of people dead and uprooted more than 275,000
people.
	   ``It is time to stop the killing and destruction in Kosovo. Our
patience is running out,'' U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
said Thursday at a NATO meeting in southern Portugal.
	   Cohen and his NATO counterparts agreed to begin assembling their
firepower to strike targets in Serbia, though they set no specific
date for an attack.
	   Milosevic reacted defiantly to the NATO threat, saying it ``only
fed the illusions'' of the rebels.
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana denied Friday that the
alliance was fuelling separatist aspirations.
	   ``We are not for changes to borders ... but we are for a real,
profound self-government'' in Kosovo, Solana said during a brief
visit to Lisbon.
	   It remains to be seen, however, if the U.N. Security Council's
tough resolution is a sufficient mandate to launch military action
against Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia, or if further
U.N. action is required.
	   ``The United States believes that no authority from the Security
Council is necessary,'' Cohen told reporters Thursday.
	   Solana said NATO officials would discuss next week the
possibility of issuing a pointed ultimatum to Milosevic.

Gunmen kill two, injur three in Angola ambush
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Gunmen killed a nun and a seminarian and
wounded three other people in an ambush on a vehicle in western
Angola, a church official said Friday.
	   The attack occurred Wednesday in Benguela province 560
kilometers (350 miles) south of Luanda, Archbishop Oscar Braga
said.
	   Roman Catholic nun Lucia Katihe and seminarian Francisco Hungulo
were shot and killed, according to Braga. Two nuns and another
unidentified passenger were wounded. Braga said no further
information was available.
	   Benguela's regional government blamed the former rebel group
UNITA for the attack.
	   Recurrent bandit attacks in outlying areas of the vast southwest
African country have fueled hostility between UNITA and the
government.
	   The foes fought a two-decade civil war before signing a
U.N.-sponsored peace accord in 1994 but the agreement has not been
fully implemented.
	   The government has condemned UNITA for failing to turn over its
last four rural strongholds, accusing rebel chief Jonas Savimbi of
keeping an army hidden in the bush.

Aziz to insist on U.N. initiative for inspections to resume
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz will
insist the United Nations take the first step to end a standoff
over weapons inspections during next week's meeting with the U.N.
secretary-general, Iraq's vice president says.
	   Aziz is scheduled to meet Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Monday
at the United Nations in New York. Aziz was instructed to keep a
hard line, Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan said in a statement
carried Friday by the official al-Iraq newspaper.
	   Earlier this month, the Security Council took tough action
against Iraq for freezing weapons inspections, suspending periodic
review of sanctions that have crippled Iraq's economy.
	   The action left Baghdad with little room to press for the easing
of sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   But the council agreed to conduct a ``comprehensive review'' of
sanctions after Iraq lets U.N. inspectors go back to work. Such a
move could force the council to acknowledge Iraq's progress in
ridding itself of weapons of mass destruction while generating
pressure for a lifting of sanctions.
	   Iraq, however, has insisted the review take place first.
	   Ramadan said Aziz was told to convey the message that Iraq will
make no changes in its position unless the United Nations ``accepts
a comprehensive and fair evaluation'' to have the embargo removed.

Palestinians and Israel close on withdrawal agreement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel and the Palestinians are much closer to
an agreement on the scope of a West Bank troop withdrawal than the
Palestinians have let on, said a Palestinian official involved in
the talks said privately.
	   However, the two sides remain far apart on how and by when the
size of an additional Israeli troop withdrawal would be determined,
said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   U.S. and Palestinian officials also confirmed that the
Palestinians' intent to unilaterally declare statehood in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip in May is being used as a bargaining chip.
	   Israel and the United State have tried to persuade Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat to drop the idea of unilaterally declaring
statehood at the end of the five-year autonomy period on May 4.
	   Earlier this month, U.S. negotiators told the Palestinians they
would seek to obtain Israeli concessions on security checks at a
future Palestinian airport if Arafat agrees to delay the
declaration of statehood, U.S. and Palestinian officials said.
	   The opening of the airport, widely seen as a major symbol of
Palestinian sovereignty, is long overdue because Israel and the
Palestinians have been unable to agree on how to monitor the influx
of passengers and cargo.
	   On the table is a U.S. proposal that Israel withdraw from 13
percent of the West Bank in exchange for a more closely defined
Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the initiative, while Israel has
expressed reservations, initially saying it could hand over only 9
percent without endangering Israel's security.
	   However, in recent weeks, Israel said it was ready to hand over
10 percent in full, while 3 percent of the land would be set aside
as a nature reserve. In that area, Israel would retain security
control and the Palestinians would not be allowed to build.
	   The Palestinians agreed to keep the nature reserve area
temporarily under Israeli security control on condition that the
agreement would state that the land is under Palestinian
jurisdiction, said the Palestinian official.
	   However, the Palestinian negotiating team decided to play down
the agreement on the scope of withdrawal because it felt no deal
could be concluded until other issues had been nailed down, such as
how to determine the scope of an additional withdrawal and a demand
to freeze the expansion of Jewish settlements.
	   Palestinian official have repeatedly said in public that the
gaps remain wide and that no progress was made in talks mediated
this month by U.S Mideast envoy Dennis Ross.
	   Diplomatic sources said Ross might return to the Middle East
next month.

Waters on long-flooded Yangtze finally fall below warning line
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Water levels on the Yangtze River have fallen
below the warning line for the first time since flooding began a
summerlong surge through central China three months ago, the Xinhua
News Agency reported Friday.
	   The Yangtze had remained above the warning stage for as long as
94 days near Jiujiang city in Jiangxi province, Xinhua said. It
added that for 40 of those days, waters stood at record highs.
	   More than 3,000 people were killed and millions made homeless in
flooding nationwide. The floods were the worst in 44 years along
the Yangtze, China's longest and the world's third longest river.
	   Although waters on the northeastern Nen and Songhua rivers have
receded, they still remain above the warning lines in many places,
Xinhua said.

Swiss Federal Banking Commission investigates UBS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ The Swiss Federal Banking Commission
on Friday asked the United Bank of Switzerland to provide details
of its involvement in troubled U.S. private investment partnership
Long Term Capital Management.
	   The commission said it is worried by the bank's loss of almost 1
billion Swiss francs (dlrs 726 million) in the third quarter. Part
of the loss is accounted for by a 950 million (dlrs 689 million)
charge the bank has written off against its investment in LTCM.
	   Commission director Daniel Zuberbuehler said the matter required
closer investigation. ``What leads serious banks to involve
themselves to such a degree in such a vehicle?'' he asked.
	   UBS is part of a 15-strong consortium of major banks and
investment firms that have agreed in principle to inject nearly
dlrs 4 billion of new financing into LTCM, a so-called hedge fund.
	   The rescue package follows the loss of almost 90 percent of the
fund's capital this year, according to banking sources.
	   Hedge funds are largely unregulated and privately managed
investment funds run for wealthy investors. They gamble borrowed
money on bonds, stocks and other more exotic investments derived
from the value of ordinary securities known as derivatives.
	   Concern is growing about the need for tighter regulation of
banks' involvement in hedge funds. Britain's Financial Services
Authority regulator has already ordered 55 banks and other
financial institutions to provide urgent information on their
exposure to LTCM and hedge funds in general.

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ The Swiss Federal Banking Commission
on Friday asked the United Bank of Switzerland to provide details
of its involvement in troubled U.S. private investment partnership
Long Term Capital Management.
	   The commission said it is worried by the bank's loss of almost 1
billion Swiss francs (dlrs 726 million) in the third quarter. Part
of the loss is accounted for by a 950 million (dlrs 689 million)
charge the bank has written off against its investment in LTCM.
	   Commission director Daniel Zuberbuehler said the matter required
closer investigation. ``What leads serious banks to involve
themselves to such a degree in such a vehicle?'' he asked.
	   UBS is part of a 15-strong consortium of major banks and
investment firms that have agreed in principle to inject nearly
dlrs 4 billion of new financing into LTCM, a so-called hedge fund.
	   The rescue package follows the loss of almost 90 percent of the
fund's capital this year, according to banking sources.
	   Hedge funds are largely unregulated and privately managed
investment funds run for wealthy investors. They gamble borrowed
money on bonds, stocks and other more exotic investments derived
from the value of ordinary securities known as derivatives.
	   Concern is growing about the need for tighter regulation of
banks' involvement in hedge funds. Britain's Financial Services
Authority regulator has already ordered 55 banks and other
financial institutions to provide urgent information on their
exposure to LTCM and hedge funds in general.

FIFA threatens to suspend national associations with AWOL clubs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH (AP) _ Soccer's world governing body said Friday it was
prepared to take drastic measures to ensure a breakaway European
Super League never gets off the ground.
	   FIFA president Sepp Blatter said soccer authorities could
suspend national associations whose teams take part in any Super
League.
	   ``The last issue FIFA would have would be to suspend the
national association that the club is a part of,'' Blatter said
following FIFA's two-day executive committee meeting. ``The
national association would then suspend that club.
	   ``If the national associations are suspended, then all the clubs
are suspended. Then the principle of solidarity would prevail and
everyone would come back to the family.''
	   The national association would still remain suspended after
banning the errant team, as it is up to the domestic bodies to reel
the club back into the FIFA family, said FIFA spokesman Keith
Cooper.
	   The clubs could not participate in international competition,
including UEFA Cup, Cup Winners Cup and Champions' League. National
teams would also be banned from international play, including the
European Championships and World Cup.
	   FIFA was quick to insist that talk of such suspensions was
premature.
	   ``All this speculation and hypothesizing is really just
hogwash,'' said Cooper. ``This Super League doesn't exist and
likely never will.
	   ``A steady diet of Manchester United and Barcelona would get
boring,'' insisted Cooper. ``You can't live off caviar alone, you
need the bread and butter. The value of such a match-up is its
rarity.''
	   The proposed Super League, conceived by a Milan-based marketing
firm Media Partners, involves the biggest names in European soccer,
including Bayern Munich, Ajax, Inter and AC Milan, Manchester
United, Arsenal and Real Madrid. Organizers hope the league could
kick off in the year 2000.
	   FIFA appointed two executive committee members to UEFA's task
force fighting the break-away group. They were Chuck Blazer, the
CONCACAF general secretary and the only American member on the
FIFA's executive board, and Slim Aloulou of Tunisia.
	   ``We must show that we are in charge of football,'' Blatter
said. ``And it's up to us to make sure no practices or abuses are
damaging the game. These outside entities are trying to enter the
FIFA family and lift out the best and most talented of our
family.''

Pacific-League leading Lions best Buffaloes 7-2
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Pacific-League leading Seibu Lions chalked up
another win Friday by beating the Kintetsu Buffaloes 7-2, boosted
by Rudy Pemberton's five RBIs.
	   Pemberton, formerly of the Boston Red Sox, belted a three-run
homer in the fourth-inning. The Lions' starting pitcher, Takashi
Ishi, kept the Buffaloes to two runs on nine hits.
	   Elsewhere, the bottom-ranked Chiba Lotte Marines won handily
over the Nippon Ham Fighters in a 7-0 game played on the Marine's
home field.
	   Lotte starting pitcher Junichiro Muto threw the shut out, giving
up 6 hits and striking out ten over the nine-inning effort. Chiba's
Iwao Omura knocked out the game's only home run, driving in two
runs.
	   In Kobe, the Orix BlueWave beat the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks 7-2.
Orix starting hurler Masafumi Hirai took the win after allowing two
runs on four hits in 6-1/3 innings.
	   No Central League games were played Friday as the only scheduled
outing, a match pitting the Chunichi Dragons against the Hanshin
Tigers, was canceled due to rain.
	   Separately, the Tigers said Friday that they have released
outfielder Desi Wilson, a 30-year-old former San Francisco Giant.

Hundreds of illegal immigrants rounded up in Italy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Police said Friday they rounded up some 300 illegal
immigrants who reached the province of Puglia on Italy's southern
shores overnight aboard boats and rubber dinghies.
	   The arrivals include Albanians, Kurds from Turkey and Iraq, and
a few refugees from the embattled Serbian province of Kosovo. They
were taken to detention centers to await expulsion.
	   Police also seized 25 kilograms (12 pounds) of marijuana in a
bag left on the beach at Brindisi, a port city in Puglia, which is
on the ``heel'' of the boot-shaped Italian peninsula.
	   The ANSA news agency said an Albanian and an Italian were
arrested driving eight Albanians to the railway station in
Brindisi.
	   Thousands of would-be immigrants reached Italy over the summer,
forcing the government to set up detention centers throughout the
south and alarming Italy's neighbors.
	   Countries like France, Austria and Germany worry that the
illegal immigrants are headed their way and have pressured Italy to
do more to stem the flow along its long coastline.
	   Under a new immigration law, Italy is supposed to repatriate
illegals within 30 days. In practice, however, this is often hard
to do because some arrive in Italy without identity papers that
reveal their nationalities.

	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ The Swiss Federal Banking Commission
on Friday asked the United Bank of Switzerland to provide details

55 million due to its contribution to a dlrs 3.5 billion rescue
package for U.S. hedge fund Long Term Capital Management.
	   A spokesman for the Swiss banking group refused to say how much
exposure Credit Suisse had left in LTCM.
	   But analysts attending a conference hosted by Credit Suisse said
its investment before the reduction amounted to $100 million.

	   RAMAT HASHARON, Israel (AP) _ France moved into a 1-0 lead over
Israel in the Davis Cup World Group qualifying rounds when Cedric
Pioline defeated Amir Hadad 6-2, 6-3, 6-3 in one hour and 40
minutes at the Ramat Hasharon Tennis Center on Friday.
	   Playing before a crowd of 2,000 spectators, Pioline, 29, ranked
18th in the world, consistently outclassed his inexperienced
20-year-old opponent, ranked 322th and making his second Davis Cup
singles appearance.
	   Pioline's powerful, varied serve repeatedly frustrated the
Israeli who managed only one service break throughout the match.
	   The Frenchman took the opening set comfortably with two service
breaks and the second with a single service break. He opened the
third set by breaking Hadad's serve yet again but appeared to
suffer a loss of concentration, allowing the Israeli to break his
serve at 3-3.
	   But Pioline's greater class showed as he took the final three
games with a plum. With a great arsenal of shots, Pioline
repeatedly pressured Hadad into errors and had little trouble
passing his opponent near the net.
	   ```There are no easy matches in tennis, but I did not feel
threatened today,'' Pioline said after the match. Pioline
attributed the ease of his victory to breaking the Israeli's serve
early in each set.
	   Hadad said that Pioline played a nearly flawless game.
	   ``I never knew what to expect from him,'' he said.
	   The second match between the two countries was to take place
later Friday afternoon, when Israel's Harel Levy of Israel played
France's Guillaume Raoux.

U.S. Embassy in Liberia to airlift former warlord away
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TIM SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ The United States will airlift former
warlord and now fugitive Roosevelt Johnson out of Liberia to end a
week-old standoff that began when he sought refuge inside the
American embassy in Monrovia last weekend.
	   After days of negotiations with President Charles Taylor's
government, American authorities have decided to helicopter Johnson
out of the country, an U.S. embassy official said Friday on
condition of anonymity.
	   Taylor has urged the United States to hand Johnson over to the
government, but the president's spokesman on Thursday said there
would be no effort to block a move to ferry Johnson away.
	   Johnson, Taylor's main rival, has been holed up in the embassy
for a week. Liberian soldiers apparently fired on his group as they
were trying to arrange for refuge at the sprawling seaside
compound.
	   Fearing another round of fighting, security has been greatly
increased at the embassy and most diplomats have been evacuated.
U.S. military reinforcements were sent in to help shore up the
embassy's defenses.
	   At least three of Johnson's supporters were killed in the
shooting and two Americans were injured.
	   Taylor's spokesman Reginald Goodridge said he hoped the United
States would cooperate with Liberia in bringing Johnson to trial on
charges of treason.
	   Johnson's group forced their way through an embassy gate during
the shooting. Although the U.S. Embassy, which did not want Johnson
in the compound in the first place, has been forced to protect him.
	   American officials, who say Johnson will not be handed over to
the Liberian government, earlier indicated a resolution to the
standoff would involve flying Johnson to a neutral country.
	   U.S. officials say they are concerned Johnson would not receive
a fair trial in Liberia _ as indicated by the use of force against
his reportedly unarmed group in front of the embassy last week.
	   Goodridge has insisted Johnson will be treated justly, saying
that representatives from the United States, international
organizations and human rights groups would be invited to monitor
the proceedings.
	   The crisis with Johnson began Friday when Liberian troops tried
to arrest the former rebel leader. Gun, rocket and mortar battles
erupted in the capital and spilled over toward the U.S. Embassy
compound, eyewitnesses had said. At least 47 people were killed in
the weekend fighting.
	   Taylor and Johnson have been longtime rivals, heading opposing
factions during Liberia's seven-year civil war.

Former chief of police given honorary status
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The former police chief who resigned in
disgrace over a bungled operation to free hostages was named
honorary chief Friday.
	   Thanassis Vassilopoulos stepped down Thursday, a day after 12
people were injured by a hand grenade explosion when police stormed
an apartment where escaped convict Sorin Matei was holding three
hostages.
	   Police had operated on the assumption that the hand grenade was
fake. The four-hour standoff and police raid were broadcast live on
television.
	   Matei had placed the grenade in one hostage's pants when it
detonated. The 25-year-old woman was hospitalized in critical
condition, with doctors giving few chances for her survival.
	   Vassilopoulos and another nine police officers were injured in
the blast.
	   He was awarded the title of honorary chief of police in
recognition of his long years of service and contributions to the
police force, government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said.
	   Honorary chief of police is an unpaid ceremonial title.
	   The Defense and Foreign Affairs Council appointed Vassilopoulos'
second-in-command, Yiannis Georgakopoulos, as new chief of police.

Bangladesh police trying to arrest author Taslima Nasrin

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Armed with an arrest warrant,
Bangladeshi police on Friday were looking for author Taslima
Nasrin, who has been hiding because of death threats from Islamic
fundamentalists who accuse her of blasphemy.
	   Her return from four years of exile has provoked street protests
and renewal of offers of a cash reward of 200,000 takas (dlrs
5,000) for anyone who kills her.
	   ``We will never forgive the infidel. We want to see her hanged
in public,'' protest organizer Fazlul Huq Amini said Friday.
	   Nasrin angered conservative Muslims after a newspaper quoted her
as saying that the Koran, Islam's holy book, should be rewritten.
She denied making the comments, but said she favored changes in
Islamic laws to give Bangladeshi women more rights.
	   Nasrin, who has been in hiding since her arrival, said she
risked her life to return to be with ``my mother in her last
days.'' Her 60-year-old mother, Eid-ul-Ara Begum, has colon cancer.
	   Plainclothes detectives joined journalists who have been
gathered outside Nasrin's apartment building since it was confirmed
she had slipped back into the country on Sept. 14 after four years
in exile in Europe. But the detectives said it was not clear
whether Nasrin was in her apartment.
	   A Dhaka magistrate on Thursday revived an arrest warrant first
issued in a civil complaint in 1994. Dhaka resident Joynul Abedin
complained Nasrin had attacked Islam in her book ``Nirbachityo
Column,'' or ``Selected Columns,'' a compilation of her newspaper
writings.
	   The magistrate also ordered Nasrin's property be confiscated as
punishment for failing to appear in court.
	   The civil case was in addition to another criminal case that
former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia's government had filed in 1994
accusing Nasrin of blaspheming Islam.
	   She was later freed on bail in the criminal case, and then fled
to Stockholm, Sweden, from where she traveled to other European and

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Slava Dosedel upset Wayne
Ferreira's in straight sets and Bohdan Ulihrach crushed Marcos
Ondruska, putting the Czech Republic up 2-0 in their Davis Cup
World Group qualifying match Friday.
	   Dosedel beat the often double-faulting Ferreira 6-2, 6-3, 6-4 in
93 minutes to give Czechs the crucial 1-0 lead.
	   ``I did not break him (Ferreira) physically, but mentally and
that's even better,'' Dosedel said.
	   Dosedel broke Ferreira's serve first in the fifth and seventh
games, and cruised the rest of the way.
	   ``I didn't feel comfortable today, I could not find my rhythm,
said Ferreira, who double faulted 11 times. ``It was my first match
on clay since the French Open.''
	   In the second match, Ulihrach crushed Ondruska 6-1, 6-2, 6-1 in
an equally one-sided match.
	   In a duel of powerful baseliners, Ulihrach was the better of the
two, never allowing his opponent in the match.
	   ``I can't remember the last time I played this well,'' Ulihrach
said.
	   In Saturday's doubles, David Rikl and Jiri Novak will face
Ferreira and Piet Norval. The reverse singles are scheduled for
Sunday.

IMF team wraps up visit, but no sign of loan money

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new grafs 2-4 with Shokhin saying he'll resign
because of Zadornov's appointment, edits to conform in grafs 8 and
16. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Despite Russia's pleas for cash, an International
Monetary Fund team wrapped up a visit Friday without recommending
that Moscow receive the next installment of a dlrs 22.6 billion
loan package.
	   In a further sign of trouble for the new government, the top
economic official announced Friday that he would resign, less than
two weeks after being named to his post, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime minister in charge of
economic policy, said the retention of Mikhail Zadornov as finance
minister was a ``political mistake,'' Interfax said. He said he
could not remain in the government if Zadornov, who served under
former Prime Ministers Viktor Chernomyrdin and Sergei Kiriyenko,
were part of the team.
	   Shokhin said Zadornov was a good financial specialist, but ``his
professionalism has not been confirmed in the past month,''
according to Interfax. He said it will be difficult to conduct
negotiations with international financial organizations when key
positions in the government ``are occupied by people who have
already deceived investors once.''
	   Russia badly wants the IMF money to help stabilize an economy
wracked by surging inflation, rising unemployment and a falling
currency. But the IMF team left without agreeing to release
additional money and will return for further negotiations on Oct.
12, Interfax reported.
	   ``We have to reach some decisions by the end of October,''
Alexander Mozhin, the IMF's acting director for Russia, was quoted
as saying by the Interfax news agency.
	   Russia signed the loan agreement with the IMF and other
international lenders in July, and shortly thereafter received the
first installment from the IMF, worth dlrs 4.8 billion. However,
that did not prevent Russia from sliding into a full-fledged crisis
last month.
	   Russia has been hoping for another dlrs 4.3 billion from the IMF
by the end of September. But the IMF has said it doesn't intend to
release more money to Russia until it's satisfied that the country
has sound economic policies in place.
	   ``Reaching an agreement between the IMF and Russia is important
for both of us,'' Shokhin said Friday, before announcing his
resignation. ``Today we need such support very much.''
	   In another development, a plan to pay out money to Russians from
their frozen bank accounts won't begin until Nov. 30, two weeks
later than previously planned, news reports said.
	   Russia's new government is trying to bail out the country's
troubled commercial banks, which have been largely paralyzed by the
economic crisis. Most major banks are either closed or have been
conducting only limited transactions.
	   As part of a plan to protect ordinary citizens, the government
has said that individual depositors may transfer their savings from
the ailing commercial banks to the state-controlled Sberbank, where
their money would be guaranteed by the government.
	   Some bank branches are still operating, but limit the amount of
money that customers can withdraw. Most business accounts have been
frozen, making it impossible for firms to make payments and bank
transfers. This has clogged up the country's entire financial
network.
	   The new government of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has been
providing billions of rubles worth of credits and loans to the
banks in a bid to get money flowing through the financial system.
	   Some banks have been clearing up their debts, but it's still not
clear which will be able to resume normal operations soon, and
which are too debt-ridden to be rescued.
	   In other developments Friday:
	   _ President Boris Yeltsin filled many of the empty Cabinet
posts. Zadornov, the finance minister in the previous government,
will keep his job in the new government.
	   _ Primakov said Friday that his government would try to clean up
the criminal activity that is pervasive in the country's
unregulated ``shadow economy.''
	   _ Russia's foreign trade for the first seven months of this year
totaled dlrs 71.9 billion, down 5 percent from the same period a
year earlier, the State Statistics Committee said.
	   _ Russia's feeble tax collection will be well below its target
of 15 billion rubles (dlrs 1 billion) this month, due in part to
the crisis, said Igor Selivamov, deputy chief of the State Tax
Service.
	   ``Tax payments often don't reach the budget because the banking
system is failing,'' he said.

EU finance chiefs downplay threat from world turmoil

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ European Union finance chiefs Friday
downplayed fears that the spreading international economic turmoil
will derail growth within the EU as it prepares to launch its
single currency.
	   ``It wouldn't be right to be overly pessimistic in light of the
global environment and to assume that we will see a global
recession,'' German central bank president Hans Tietmeyer said
ahead a two-day meeting of top EU finance officials.
	   The Bundesbank president said the market turmoil was not
symptomatic of worldwide problems, but rather reflected ``a lack of
trust in the policies of individual countries.''
	   Europe's central bank governors were scheduled to join finance
ministers from the 15 EU nations Saturday in Vienna's Hofburg
Imperial Palace for talks that were expected to focus on the EU's
response to the Russian crisis.
	   ``The EU can do everything in its power to stop Russia feeling
isolated,'' said German Economics Minister Guenther Rexrodt. ``What
we cannot do is give fresh cash.''
	   Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International
Monetary Fund was also scheduled to attend the talks on how to help
Russia. The IMF is holding back payment of the next installments of
a dlrs 22.6 billion loan package until it is satisfied Moscow has a
sound economic plan.
	   The 15 EU finance ministers opened the two-day meeting Friday,
focusing on final preparations for the birth of the euro, which 11
EU nations will as their shared currency on Jan. 1.
	   EU Commission President Jacques Santer said the talks would
concentrate on how the euro-zone would be represented in
international organizations such as the IMF or the G-7 group of
world economic powers.
	   French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn is expected to
propose the three euro-zone nations in the G-7 _ France, Germany
and Italy _ take turns to represent the whole bloc. But with
smaller nations resisting that as handing too much influence to the
big three, Santer indicated the issue will not be resolved in
Vienna.
	   ``This will certainly keep us busy in the coming months as well
because we still have a lot to do,'' he said.
	   The ministers considered deadlines by which the 11 euro nations
will aim to balance their budgets. EU Finance Commissioner
Yves-Thibault de Silguy suggested 2001 or 2002 as possible target,
but said he was unlikely they would announce a date here.
	   Britain and Luxembourg were set to resist proposals for an
EU-wide tax on interest earned on savings in other nations.
	   Although Britain _ along with Sweden, Denmark and Greece _ will
not adopt the euro, Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown faces
pressure from home fight a ruling that bans all national symbols _
including the head of Queen Elizabeth II _ from euro bank notes.

Palestinians and Israel close on withdrawal agreement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel and the Palestinians are much closer to
an agreement on the scope of a West Bank troop withdrawal than the
Palestinians have let on, a Palestinian official involved in the
talks said.
	   However, the two sides remain far apart on how and by when the
size of an additional Israeli troop withdrawal would be determined,
said the official, who spoke privately on condition of anonymity.
	   On the table is a U.S. proposal that Israel withdraw from 13
percent of the West Bank in exchange for a more closely defined
Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the initiative, while Israel has
expressed reservations.
	   However, in recent weeks, Israel said it was ready to hand over
10 percent in full, while 3 percent of the land would be set aside
as a nature reserve. In that area, Israel would retain security
control and the Palestinians would not be allowed to build.
	   The Palestinians agreed to keep the nature reserve area
temporarily under Israeli security control on condition that the
agreement would state that the land is under Palestinian
jurisdiction, the Palestinian official said Wednesday.
	   However, the Palestinian negotiating team decided to play down
the agreement on the scope of withdrawal because it felt no deal
could be concluded until other issues had been nailed down, such as
a demand to freeze the expansion of Jewish settlements.
	   Palestinian officials have repeatedly said in public that the
gaps remain wide and that no progress was made in talks mediated
this month by U.S Mideast envoy Dennis Ross.
	   U.S. and Palestinian officials also have confirmed that the
Palestinians' intent to unilaterally declare statehood in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip in May is being used as a bargaining chip.
	   Earlier this month, U.S. negotiators told the Palestinians they
would seek to obtain Israeli concessions on security checks at a
future Palestinian airport if Arafat agrees to delay the
declaration of statehood, the U.S. and Palestinian officials said.
	   The opening of the airport, widely seen as a major symbol of
Palestinian sovereignty, is long overdue because Israel and the
Palestinians have been unable to agree on how to monitor the influx
of passengers and cargo.

Lebanese boy, two militiamen wounded in southern Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli forces shelled suspected
guerrilla hideouts in southern Lebanon Friday, wounding a Lebanese
boy, security officials said.
	   Ten-year-old Hussein Harb was wounded by shrapnel from a shell
that exploded near his home in the village of Arab Salim, about
five miles (eight kilometers) north of Marjayoun, the main town in
an Israeli-occupied enclave in the south.
	   The area is often used by Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas as
a base to launch attacks on Israeli troops and their allied
Lebanese militiamen in the occupied zone.
	   Harb was being treated at a hospital in the southern port of
Sidon, the officials said, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   Lebanese guerrillas retaliated with attacks on positions of the
Israeli army and its militia allies inside the zone, wounding two
militiamen from the South Lebanon Army, the officials said.
	   Both Hezbollah and the Shiite Amal movement, another militia
fighting Israeli forces in southern Lebanon, had released a series
of statements announcing attacks against Israeli and SLA positions.
	   Hezbollah is the main guerrilla group fighting to dislodge
Israeli troops and SLA militiamen from the zone in southern Lebanon
Israel set up in 1985 to protect its northern territory from
cross-border attacks.

Broncos might find some friends in Washington
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY WILNER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ They are looking every bit the part of Super
Bowl champions. The Denver Broncos are 3-0, winning even with a
hobbled John Elway. And as if they need it, they get a break in the
schedule this week, facing the winless, even hapless Washington
Redskins.
	   While the Broncos have outscored opponents 103-61 _ they easily
have the most points in the American National Football League and
rank third in total offense _ the Skins have been a sieve, yielding
100 points. They've scored just 48.
	   Just as ominously, Denver has 38 points in the first quarter,
and it's opposition has seven.
	   ``We're 0-3 and we face Denver,'' receiver Leslie Shepherd said.
``The only thing good about that is that we're playing at home.
And, after the second quarter, if we're not doing well, there will
be more people cheering for Denver than for the Redskins.''
	   Shannon Sharpe doesn't buy all this poor-mouthing. He sees a
sleeping lion in Washington.
	   ``They're not an 0-3 ballclub,'' the Denver tight end said.
``Indianapolis, maybe they're an 0-3 ballclub. Washington Redskins,
they're not.
	   ``You got (Dana) Stubblefield and (Dan) Wilkinson. You've got
Darrell Green and (Cris) Dishman. You've got guys that are in the
Pro Bowl every year or every other year. We're not buying into
that. They've have some bad breaks, some mistakes, and other teams
would capitalize on them, but they're a lot better ballclub than
they're showing.''
	   Perhaps. But if they don't start showing it soon, the Skins can
forget about contending for the playoffs, even in as weak a
division as the NFC East.
	   Elway has a hamstring problem, but that might not even provide
an edge for the Redskins. Bubby Brister, who completed 10 of 17
passes in relief last week, apparently can take over without much
of a problem.
	   ``They're better with Elway,'' Washington coach Norv Turner
said. ``But I've seen Brister have outstanding football games. The
rest of the group doesn't change when the quarterback changes.''
	   That means Terrell Davis and Sharpe and Rod Smith and a solid
offensive line and an opportunistic defense and ...
	   ``We're a good enough football team,'' Elway said, ``that they
can win without me.''
	   Elsewhere on Sunday, it's Arizona at St. Louis, Green Bay at
Carolina, Jacksonville at Tennessee, Kansas City at Philadelphia,
New Orleans at Indianapolis, Oakland at Dallas, Seattle at
Pittsburgh, the New York Giants at San Diego, Atlanta at San
Francisco, Minnesota at Chicago, and Cincinnati at Baltimore. The
Monday night game features Tampa Bay at Detroit.
	   Off this week are Buffalo, Miami, New England and the New York
Jets.
	   The other matchups of unbeaten vs. winless teams involve the
Packers and Panthers, the Vikings and Bears, the Colts and Saints.
	   Green Bay, which is searching for a running game, has been
carried by the passing of Brett Favre and a stingy, big-play
defense. The Panthers are in the midst of a rash of injuries and
have scored a mere 28 points this season.
	   ``The general consensus probably is that we don't have much of a
chance in this game,'' Carolina coach Dom Capers said. ``But I
don't think there's anybody in our locker room who feels that
way.''
	   Minnesota could get a test from Chicago, which played 2 1-2
strong halves before wilting against Tampa Bay last weekend.
	   ``They're anxious. They're upset. They're excited,'' Vikings
coach Dennis Green said. ``I think they're going to be very
hostile. It's going to be up to us to get in there and start
fast.''
	   New Orleans' visit to Indianapolis has an interesting theme,
with the Colts' stars, Marshall Faulk and Peyton Manning, having
grown up in New Orleans rooting for the Saints. Indy coach Jim Mora
was the Saints' most successful coach before resigning in the
middle of the 1996 season.
	   ``It's a little bit different because I am a Saints fan, being
that I'm from there,'' said Faulk. ``Young or old, you pick up a
check, and that's what we've got to do. We've got to play better.''

Swiss Federal Banking Commission investigates UBS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ The Swiss Federal Banking Commission
on Friday asked the United Bank of Switzerland to provide details
of its involvement in troubled U.S. private investment partnership
Long Term Capital Management.
	   The commission said it is worried by the bank's loss of almost 1
billion Swiss francs (dlrs 726 million) in the third quarter. Part
of the loss is accounted for by a 950 million franc (dlrs 689
million) charge the bank has written off against its investment in
LTCM.
	   Commission director Daniel Zuberbuehler said the matter required
closer investigation. ``What leads serious banks to involve
themselves to such a degree in such a vehicle?'' he asked.
	   UBS is part of a 15-strong consortium of major banks and
investment firms that have agreed in principle to inject nearly
dlrs 4 billion of new financing into LTCM, a so-called hedge fund.
	   The rescue package follows the loss of almost 90 percent of the
fund's capital this year, according to banking sources.
	   Hedge funds are largely unregulated and privately managed
investment funds run for wealthy investors. They gamble borrowed
money on bonds, stocks and other more exotic investments derived
from the value of ordinary securities known as derivatives.
	   Concern is growing about the need for tighter regulation of
banks' involvement in hedge funds. Britain's Financial Services
Authority regulator has already ordered 55 banks and other
financial institutions to provide urgent information on their
exposure to LTCM and hedge funds in general.
	   Meanwhile, Switzerland's second biggest banking group Credit
Suisse Friday said it expects 1998 revenues to be reduced by dlrs
55 million due to its contribution to a dlrs 3.5 billion rescue
package for U.S. hedge fund Long Term Capital Management.
	   A spokesman for the Swiss banking group refused to say how much
exposure Credit Suisse had left in LTCM.
	   But analysts attending a conference hosted by Credit Suisse said
its investment before the reduction amounted to dlrs 100 million.

	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ U.S. search and rescue
teams joined weary Dominican rescuers Friday in looking for more
bodies buried in mud and rubble from Hurricane Georges, which
killed at least 307 people _ possibly many more _ throughout the
Caribbean.
	   U.S. and French rescuers delivered aid to Santo Domingo and
joined the search for hundreds of Dominicans missing since the
storm ravaged the Caribbean nation on Tuesday.
	   Dominican armed forces chief Ruben Paulino Alvarez said that 125
were known dead in the Dominican Republic, with another 156
missing.
	   The death toll didn't include 76 bodies that Red Cross official
Angel Almanzar said were recovered Thursday by workers in San Juan
de la Maguana, 120 miles (190 kilometers) west of the capital,
Santo Domingo.
	   In Manomatuey, where a shelter was washed away Wednesday, three
more bodies were pulled from the muck to bring the death toll there
to at least eight. And along Santo Domingo's seaside boulevard, a
woman's bloated, blanched body washed ashore.
	   The aftermath appeared as bleak as the storm itself. With an
estimated 90 percent of the country's crops wiped out, food
supplies would not last long, officials warned. Many people
desperately searched for clean water in a country still partially
submerged.
	   Georges continued its onslaught, striking the Florida Keys and
swamping the streets of Key West on Friday.
	   The death toll rose Friday in Haiti, where officials said 87
people were killed and at least 34 were missing.

Netherlands leads Ecuador 2-0 in Davis Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EINDHOVEN, Netherlands (AP) _ Wins for Paul Haarhuis and Jan
Siemerink Friday took the Netherlands to a 2-0 lead over Ecuador
and the brink of retaining its Davis Cup World Group status.
	   The Dutchman singles stars conceded just seven games each as
Haarhuis steamrollered Nicolas Lapentti 6-2, 6-3, 6-2 and Siemerink
outclassed Luis Morejon 6-3, 6-3, 6-1.
	   The world No.1 Dutch doubles pairing of Haarhuis and Jacco
Eltingh should wrap up this World Group Qualifying Round tie 3-0
Saturday against Lapentti and 38-year-old veteran Andres Gomez.
	   Siemerink's top form this year has taken him back to No. 20 in
the rankings and his dominant serve-volley performance produced
nine love games and 14 aces.
	   On each of the five ocasions he broke 158th-ranked Morejon's
service, the break point produced a net-stroke, wild out-of-court
slash or other error from the Ecuadorean No.2.
	   Siemerink's serve was only threatened in game two of the second
set, when he saved two break points with aces.
	   The Haarhuis-Lapentti rubber was expected to be more
competetive, pitting No. 58 on the ATP rankings against No.65, but
Lapentti seemed ill at ease with the fast indoor Supreme surface.
	   Haarhuis started sharply and stormed to 5-1 lead, then dropped
his serve but bounced back in the next game to convert his first
set point with a delicate down-the-line backhand pass.
	   After that, Lapentti never looked likely to recover.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Amnesty International gave its backing Friday to
Malayasia's jailed former deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim,
saying that he was a ``prisoner of conscience.''
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohhamad dismissed Anwar on Sept. 2 and
Anwar was arrested on Sunday. Fourteen of his associates have also
been detained, Amnesty International said.
	   ``Anwar and his associates are prisoners of conscience detained
solely for non-violently calling for political reforms and for
holding different opinions to the prime minister,'' Amnesty
International said.
	   ``By misusing Malaysia's laws to detain political opponents,
Prime Minister Mahathir is contravening international legal
standards on freedom of expression, the right to a fair trial and
the treatment of detainees,'' the organization added.

Slater tunes up for test with double century
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RIZWAN ALI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Michael Slater covered for a struggling
Mark Taylor, hitting for a double century against a Karachi 11
Friday in the first day of a four-day match.
	   Slater's five-hour plus stand led a run to 438 for five when
stumps were drawn for the day. Ian Healy was unbeaten on 4 while
Ricky Ponting was not out on 12.
	   Slater's boundary-filled 221-run innings included 24 fours and a
half dozen sixes, while he faced 260 balls during his 318 minutes.
	   With Steve Waugh (92), Slater put on 221 runs for the fourth
wicket in only 132 minutes.
	   Pakistan, coming off a 4-1 rout of India in the Sahara Cup
one-day tournament in Toronto, last week, saw spinners Ali Hussain
Rizvi and Shahid Afridi hammered to all parts of the ground with
pitch giving little assistance to slow bowlers.
	   Waqar Younis, back to competitive cricket after nearly three
months since injuring his elbow, missed his chance to get rid of
the right-handed Slater when Suleman Huda dropped him at forward
short leg off the third ball of the match.
	   Taylor struggled for 21 minutes for his one run before he was
trapped in front of the wickets by medium fast Ali Gohar. The
left-handed Australian skipper tried to play a straight delivery
half forwardly and was adjudged leg before.
	   Huda made amends for his early lapse when he dived and held onto
a bat and pad catch of Justin Langer as the Australian were reduced
to 41 for two by 17th over.
	   But Slater then combined first with Mark and then with his
brother Steve Waugh to attack a mediocre Pakistan bowling effort.
	   In association with Mark Waugh, Slater put on a rapid 132 for
the third wicket in only 108 minutes before leg-spinner Rizvi got
rid of Mark. Mark Waugh hit two sixes and seven boundaries in his
66-run innings before he got a faint edge while trying to hoist
Rizvi over mid-wicket.
	   Rizvi captured two wickets for 136 while Afridi also earned a
pair in conceding 79 runs. Younis remained wicketless and struggled
during his seven overs to get back into rhythm.

	   In a statement released Friday, FIFA also said it unanimously
supported ``firm and concerted action...to prevent the same owners
controlling more than one club in the same competition.''
	   That appeared to be a clear reference to the British investment
company ENIC, which owns stakes in Glasgow Rangers, AEK Athens and
Slavia Prague and recently offered to buy a 40 percent stake in
Tottenham Hotspur.
	   FIFA also said it had serious concerns about non-soccer
organizations taking a controlling interest in certain clubs.
	   The statement seemed directed at the 623.4 million pound (dlrs 1
billion) purchase of Manchester United by Rupert Murdoch's
satellite broadcasting company BSkyB.
	   BSkyB already has a large stake in the Premier League, owning
the rights to televise league and England international matches
until 2001.
	   Arsenal, defending Premier League and F.A. Cup titlist, is also
negotiating a possible takeover by a media company.

Finland rejects asylum for Albanian junior soccer team
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ The government turned down an asylum
request Friday from an Albanian junior soccer team, saying the boys
would be in no danger if they returned home.
	   The 19 players and four adult assistants from Tirana applied for
political asylum after participating in the Helsinki Cup
international junior soccer tournament in July.
	   ``They did not meet the requirements necessary for granting
political asylum, and we decided that they are in no danger if they
they return home, '' said Tarja-Riitta Nissinen from the
Directorate of Immigration.
	   Nissinen said the Albanians would not be deported and said they
could appeal the decision.
	   ``In that case, the situation (in Albania) could be different
from what it is now and we would have to reconsider,''she said.
	   The team and trainers have lived at a refugee center near Raahe,
600 kilometers (370 miles) north of Helsinki, where they have been
training for games against local teams.
	   The main coach of the team, Fatmir Tarja, has said that the
application was planned in advance. The boys' parents in Albania
reportedly told Finnish media that they back the asylum
applications.
	   Mauri Karjalainen, who represents the Albanians, said the team
and the trainers did not want to comment on the immigration
authorities' decision to reject the asylum application.
	   ``They are in good spirits, and have started training for their
next game on Sunday,'' Karjalainen said. ``They have been told
about the decision and do not want to comment, and I have no
further comment either.''

Ex-Red Cross official says group's head may have misused U.S.
</HEADLINE>
funds &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The head of the Mexican Red Cross may have
misused U.S. aid for hurricane victims, according to one of 10 top
officials with the group who resigned this week amid complaints
over its management.
	   The accusations against Jose Barroso, president of the Mexican
Red Cross, were made Thursday by a former member of the non-profit
group's executive board, Salvador Padilla Cano, the government news
agency Notimex reported.
	   Padilla Cano is one of eight board members who resigned
Wednesday. Two more resigned Thursday, local media reported.
	   Padilla Cano said Barroso could not produce documents proving
that the Red Cross received about dlrs 200,000 in medicine it
purchased from another non-profit foundation he also heads.
	   Money for the purchase came from a dlrs 300,000 donation made by
the United States government to help victims of 1997's Hurricane
Pauline, Padilla Cano said, citing a report from the Red Cross
treasurer.
	   Barroso denied that he mismanaged the Red Cross, noting that the
group's spending routinely is reviewed by an internal auditor.
Depite calls for his resignation, Barroso said he would serve out
his term through April 1999.
	   Last week, Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo criticized the
group for failing to deliver aid collected in Mexico City to
Chiapas. Barroso countered that the military was refusing to supply
air transportation as it had done in previous disasters.
	   A congressional committee announced Thursday it would hold
hearings with the army, government agencies and the Red Cross on
alleged problems in delivering aid to Chiapas.
	   The accusations strike a sensitive chord here, given reports
that some officials diverted aid in past disasters.

Hungary agrees to take part in joint bid for soccer championship
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ The Hungarian government agreed to take
part in a joint bid with Austria to host the 2004 European Soccer
Championship, the Nemzeti Sport daily reported Friday.
	   Earlier this month, Economics Minister Attila Chikan expressed
doubts about financing the project, which is expected to cost
taxpayers between 15 billion and 20 billion forints (dlrs 70
million and 85 million).
	   Prime Minister Viktor Orban, however, is a former junior league
soccer player and great fan. His cabinet voted Thursday to support
the bid.
	   The deadline for bid submissions is Sept. 30.
	   Other bidders for the championships are Spain, Portugal and
Switzerland.
	   UEFA is expected to announce the winner in July.
	   Orban's first foreign visit after his May election victory was
to Paris, where he watched the final of the World Championships as
the guest of President Jacques Chirac.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Belgium's government plunged into
crisis Friday after the interior minister offered to resign over
the police's role in the death of a Nigerian woman who had become a
symbol for opponents of Belgium's asylum policy.
	   The center-left coalition asked Socialist minister Louis
Tobback, who is also a vice-premier, to reconsider his decision
since he was a key player in government efforts to reform Belgium's
embattled police forces and judiciary.
	   ``Minister Tobback has agreed to think it over and will announce
a final decision before Saturday evening,'' said Prime Minister
Jean-Luc Dehaene.
	   ``The cabinet is convinced that the resignation of the minister
is not the right way to take political responsibility,'' said a
government statement.
	   The coalition was trying to keep Tobback on the job since
several important issue had to be dealt with over the coming
months.
	   ``I hope he can still change his mind. He is very important
within the government,'' said Justice Minister Tony Van Parys, a
Christian Democrat, at Friday's weekly Cabinet session.

Oslo to cut speed limits in clean-air effort
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Speed limits in the Norwegian capital will
be reduced on some days this winter to reduce harmful road dust
churned up by cars and trucks, highway department announced Friday.
	   The speed limit on all roads will be cut to 60 kilometers an
hour (37 mph) on days when pollution exceeds set limits. Current
speed limits range from 70 to 90 kilometers per hour (43 to 56
mph).
	   Motor vehicles, especially those with studded snow tires, churn
up tiny particles of dust from such road surfaces as asphalt,
increasing pollution and plaguing those with respiratory ailments.
The problem is worst on dry, cold days in the winter.
	   The option of lowering speed limits was the first step in a
program to clean up air in the Norwegian capital, a city of 500,000
people. Minister of Transport Odd Einar Doerum said the new rules
would go into force on Dec. 1.
	   Other measures being considered are a ban on stubbed snow tires,
and allowing only cars equipped with pollution cutting catalytic
converter exhaust systems on the road when pollution is high.

Quake restoration still nearly 20 years from completion, Italy's

experts warn &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ASSISI, Italy (AP) _ Restoration of the quake-damaged cultural
treasures of central Italy's hill towns is still nearly two decades
from completion, experts warn going into Saturday's first
anniversary of the quake.
	   For many of the 11,100 quake victims still living in temporary
housing, there is not even a target date for when they might have
homes of their own again.
	   ``For us, after a year, we don't know positively when we can
return,'' one quake victim, Antonella Marcaccini, told Italy's Il
Messagero daily. ``The anger is growing.''
	   The two, sharp jolts of Sept. 26, 1997, killed 10 and cracked
and crumbled buildings in the culturally rich regions of Umbria and
Marche.
	   Workers steadily are repairing sections of the most famous
landmark damaged in the quake, Assisi's St. Francis Basilica. Two
sections of vaulted ceiling in the upper church collapsed in the
second jolt, killing four people as they inspected damage from the
first.
	   At this pace, church leaders hope to have the upper church
restored in time for the Oct. 4, 1999, feast of St. Francis.
Computers are aiding the piecing together of the frescoed ceiling
from 50,000 fragments the size of postage stamps.
	   Full restoration of Umbria's and Marche's cultural works will
take $1.2 billion and end only in 2015, experts estimate.
	   Rebuilding and replacement of homes damaged in the quake is
being slowed by bureaucracy and the shortage of qualified workers,
builders and residents charge. Engineers point to 900 decrees
issued by the government in the year since the quake.
	   Trailer cities have sprung up since the quake, with trailer
laundries, trailer barber shops and trailer flower stores. To some,
the very orderliness of the trailer towns suggest that their
inhabitants won't be going home any time soon.
	   In Assisi, St. Francis' birthplace, Franciscan brothers plan a
memorial Mass on Sunday in honor of the four who died at the
church.

Cyprus insists on solution according to UN resolutions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The president of Cyprus on Friday rejected
Turkish proposals that the war-divided island become a
confederation, saying a solution to the conflict must take place on
the basis of U.N. resolutions.
	   Glafcos Clerides said in a speech at the U.N. General Assembly
that Turkish-Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash put forward the idea of a
confederation in order to create a ``Turkish colony'' in Cyprus.
	   The Cypriot government, with the support of the five permanent
members of the Security Council, rejects any proposal that would
consolidate the Mediterranean island's division.
	   Accepting the proposal, the Cypriot government says, would
necessitate recognition of the breakaway Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus, which is recognized only by Turkey. Ankara
maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   ``The recent demand of the Turkish-Cypriot leader Mr. Denktash
in the presence of the Turkish foreign minister for a confederation
solution violates all U.N. resolutions,'' Clerides said.
	   He said it was ``aimed at derailing the negotiating process from
the base of the U.N. resolutions on Cyprus, but also at
extinguishing the independence of the Republic of Cyprus and
creating, under the guise of a Turkish Cypriot Republic a Turkish
colony in Cyprus, or to say the least, a Turkish protectorate.''
	   Cyprus has been divided into a Greek Cypriot-controlled south
and a Turkish-occupied north since a 1974 Turkish invasion
following an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   Clerides said Cyprus was ``committed to a peaceful solution on
the basis of the United Nations resolutions.''
	   The United States is anxious to restart U.N.-sponsored peace
talks that have been stalled since August and to persuade Cyprus to
cancel the planned deployment of Russian S-300 anti-aircraft
missiles in November.
	   Ankara has threatened to use force to prevent the deployment, a
move which Athens says will lead to a war between Greece and
Turkey.
	   Turkey's prime minister warned world leaders at the General
Assembly on Thursday that the tense division in Cyprus had reached
a ``critical junction'' that could erupt in war.
	   Actions ``by Greece and the Greek-Cypriots poses a serious
threat to the security of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus
and on Turkey and to peace and stability in the eastern
Mediterranean,'' Mesut Yilmaz said in a speech that renewed a call
for a confederation.
	   ``I believe that the proposed confederation can finally open an
avenue for peace, reconciliation based on a common destiny for the
two peoples in Cyprus.'' Yilmaz said.

Chancellor and challenger make final appeal to voters

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl and challenger Gerhard
Schroeder wound up their campaigns Friday running neck and neck in
one of the tightest election races in postwar Germany.
	   Kohl and his Christian Democrats have steadily whittled away at
the early lead enjoyed by the Social Democrats and candidate
Schroeder, and polls now put them virtually even.
	   The Emnid polling institute put the parties within one
percentage point of each other Friday, too close to call: 39
percent for the Christian Democrats, 40 percent for the Social
Democrats.
	   Both candidates planned major rallies Friday evening _ Kohl in
the Rhine River city of Mainz and Schroeder in Berlin _ in a final
push to win over the 24 percent of voters who remain undecided in
the Emnid poll. Both men also have been making the rounds of TV
studios for nearly nightly interviews all week.
	   After 16 years in office, many voters can hardly remember a
Germany without Kohl as chancellor. Kohl is counting on that
steadfast image _ that of ``the eternal chancellor'' _ to help him
win a record fifth term.
	   Asked during a question-and-answer show Friday on the national
RTL network to describe the ideal chancellor, Kohl quipped: ``One
is sitting right in front of you.''
	   But with the parties so close, it seems most likely that Kohl's
Christian Democrats and Schroeder's Social Democrats will have to
share power in a so-called ``grand coalition,'' something Germany
hasn't seen in almost 30 years.
	   Anything is possible. Even the candidates sound wary.
	   For the first time, Kohl conceded it ``possible'' on Wednesday
that Germany might wind up with a grand coalition _ the first
glimmer that his conservative party might not manage a wide victory
over the center-left opposition.
	   Schroeder has left the door open for a grand coalition all
along. Only this week, with Kohl at his heels, has the charismatic
state governor hinted that his party could accept being the junior
member of a coalition led by Kohl's party.
	   In that case, Kohl claims he would step down. Enter: Wolfgang
Schaeuble, Kohl's designated heir.
	   Schaeuble, 56, is Germany's most popular politician. But he is
paralyzed from a 1990 assassination attempt, and he doesn't deny
that there are questions about his fitness for office.
	   Anxious to avoid mistakes, both sides fought last-minute
campaign ripples Friday.
	   Kohl again denied he would raise the main sales tax if
re-elected, a response to a gaffe by one of his Cabinet members
last week who said the opposite.
	   The Social Democrats' would-be economics minister Jost
Stollmann, a computer entrepreneur without party affiliation,
renewed his call for cutting social welfare programs. But party
officials said no major cuts were envisaged.
	   The tight race right up to the final days bears some resemblance
to last time, in 1994, when it looked for a while like the Social
Democrats were going to give Kohl beating. By summer, though, Kohl
had taken a confidence-boosting lead that he never relinquished.
	   Schroeder's team has used up the 12-point lead they held in the
spring. But voters this year are conflicted right up to the end.
	   Polls show people tired of Kohl, the seasoned statesman, yet
wary of Schroeder, untested on the world stage at a time of
economic turmoil in Russia and Asia, and war in the Yugoslav
province of Kosovo.
	   The survival of Kohl's government depends not only on his
popularity but also on the tiny pro-business Free Democrats, his
junior coalition partner. Polls suggest they may not make it into
parliament this time.
	   If Schroeder wins enough votes to form a coalition, his likely
partner is the environmentalist Greens party.
	   The Greens have their best shot yet at entering government.
Their biggest threat are swing voters in the east who many predict
will opt for the ex-communist Party for Democratic Socialism as a
protest vote against Bonn politics.
	   Pollsters are at a loss to say which way the east will vote.
	   ``They change their attitudes every few minutes,'' says Dieter
Roth, of the Electoral Research Group. ``In the west there are
longstanding loyalties to parties that just don't exist in the
east.''

Gunmen kill two religious workers in Angola ambush
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Gunmen killed a Roman Catholic nun and a
seminarian and wounded three other people in an ambush in western
Angola, a church official said Friday.
	   Gunmen shot at the group of religious workers while they
traveled Wednesday in a vehicle in Benguela province 560 kilometers
(350 miles) south of Luanda, Archbishop Oscar Braga said.
	   Nun Lucia Katihe and seminarian Francisco Hungulo were shot to
death, and two other nuns and an unidentified passenger were
wounded, Braga said.
	   Benguela's regional government blamed the former rebel group
UNITA for the attack.
	   Recurrent bandit attacks in outlying areas of the vast southwest
African country have fueled hostility between UNITA and the
government.
	   The foes fought a two-decade civil war before signing a
U.N.-sponsored peace accord in 1994, but the agreement has not been
fully implemented.
	   The government has condemned UNITA for failing to turn over its
last four rural strongholds, accusing rebel chief Jonas Savimbi of
keeping an army hidden in the bush.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel and the Palestinians are much closer to
an agreement on the scope of a West Bank troop withdrawal than the
Palestinians have let on, a Palestinian official involved in the
talks said.
	   However, the two sides remain far apart on how and by when the
size of an additional Israeli troop withdrawal would be determined,
said the official, who spoke privately on condition of anonymity.
He spoke earlier this week on condition that the information be

Arafat asserts right to declare state in May
</HEADLINE>

Arafat will raise the statehood issue in his U.N. speech, Israeli
legislator calling on Netanyahu to suspend negotiations; changes

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Heading into a diplomatic showdown with Israel
in the United Nations, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said Friday
he is entitled to declare a state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
in May.
	   Arafat is to address the U.S. General Assembly on Monday. His
spokesman, Nabil Abourdeneh, told the Voice of Palestine radio that
the Palestinian leader will raise the statehood issue in his speech
and seek world support for the fledgling Palestinian entity.
	   Many countries are expected to recognize a Palestinian state,
and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been trying to
thwart the Palestinian campaign for international backing.
	   In his speech to the General Assembly on Thursday, Netanyahu
warned that a unilateral declaration of statehood in May would lead
to the ``complete collapse of the (peace) process.''
	   Netanyahu said Israel would react harshly, but gave no details.
	   Uzi Landau, a senior legislator in Netanyahu's Likud Party,
demanded Friday that Israel immediately call off negotiations with
the Palestinians on a West Bank troop pullback.
	   Two Cabinet ministers, Shaul Yahalom and Rafael Eitan, said that
in response to a declaration of statehood, Israel must annex areas
of the West Bank and Gaza still under its control.
	   Israel has complete authority over one-third of Gaza and 70
percent of the West Bank.
	   Under the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreements, the five-year
period of Palestinian autonomy expires on May 4. By that time, the
two sides are to have negotiated a permanent peace accord that
would determine the nature and borders of the Palestinian entity.
	   With both sides still hung up over interim issues, such as a
staged Israeli troop pullback in the West Bank, it appears very
unlikely such an agreement can be concluded on deadline.
	   The Palestinians argue that once the interim period is over,
they have the right to declare a state. Israel says the peace
accords bar the two sides from taking unilateral steps, and that a
declaration of statehood is a major violation.
	   Setting the stage for his diplomatic battle with Netanyahu at
the United Nations in New York, Arafat said during a stopover in
the Belgian town of Liege on Friday that he would prefer a
negotiated settlement with Israel, but noted that the autonomy
period expires May 4.
	   After that date, Arafat said, ``we have the right to go in any
direction, including declaring our own independent state, which is
our priority, so as to advance the peace process.''
	   On Thursday night, Arafat's Cabinet also asserted that a state
would be declared in May. ``At the end of the interim period, it
(the Palestinian government) shall declare the establishment of a
Palestinian state on all Palestinian land occupied since 1967, with
Jerusalem as the eternal capital of the Palestinian state,'' the
Cabinet said in a statement.
	   Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza and traditionally Arab east
Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war.
	   The United States has been trying to persuade the Palestinians
to delay a declaration of statehood. Palestinian and U.S. officials
close to the talks on a West Bank troop withdrawal confirmed that
the issue has come up as a bargaining chip.
	   Earlier this month, U.S. negotiators told the Palestinians they
would seek Israeli concessions on security checks at a future
Palestinian airport if Arafat agreed to delay the declaration of
statehood, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The opening of the airport, widely seen as a major symbol of
Palestinian sovereignty, is long overdue because Israel and the
Palestinians disagree on how to monitor the influx of passengers
and cargo.

NZealand FM praises regional effort in Bougainville
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ New Zealand's foreign minister praised
regional efforts Friday to bring about a cease-fire in
Bougainville, saying peace has now come to the war-torn island.
	   It was the governments of the region _ Australia, Figi, Vanuatu
and the Solomon Islands _ ``who set out to help the government of
Papua New Guinea and representatives of the Bougainville people to
bring this horror to an end,'' Donald Charles McKinnon told the
U.N. General Assembly.
	   Bougainville was ``ravaged by civil war for nine years but has
enjoyed peace for the last 12 months,'' he said in thanking the
regional effort to bring about an end to the uprising.
	   The so-called Lincoln agreement signed in New Zealand last
January ended an armed conflict between Bougainvillean independence
fighters and the Papua New Guinean military, the longest war in the
Pacific since World War II.
	   The agreement calls for a permanent cease-fire, provisions for
talks on the issue of independence for Bougainville, and elections
by year's end.
	   The Papua New Guinea government, however, said earlier this
month that elections for a reconciliation government are unlikely
to be held until next year because of a delay in a meeting between
leaders from the two sides.

	   ASSISI, Italy (AP) _ Restoration of the quake-damaged cultural
treasures of central Italy's hill towns is still nearly two decades
from completion, experts warn going into Saturday's first
anniversary of the quake.
	   For many of the 11,100 quake victims still living in temporary
housing, there is not even a target date for when they might have
homes of their own again.
	   ``For us, after a year, we don't know positively when we can
return,'' one quake victim, Antonella Marcaccini, told Italy's Il
Messagero daily. ``The anger is growing.''
	   The two, sharp jolts of Sept. 26, 1997, killed 10 and cracked
and crumbled buildings in the culturally rich regions of Umbria and
Marche.
	   Workers steadily are repairing sections of the most famous
landmark damaged in the quake, Assisi's St. Francis Basilica. Two
sections of vaulted ceiling in the upper church collapsed in the
second jolt, killing four people as they inspected damage from the
first.
	   At this pace, church leaders hope to have the upper church
restored in time for the Oct. 4, 1999, feast of St. Francis.
Computers are aiding the piecing together of the frescoed ceiling
from 50,000 fragments the size of postage stamps.
	   Full restoration of Umbria's and Marche's cultural works will
take dlrs 1.2 billion and end only in 2015, experts estimate.
	   Rebuilding and replacement of homes damaged in the quake is
being slowed by bureaucracy and the shortage of qualified workers,
builders and residents charge. Engineers point to 900 decrees
issued by the government in the year since the quake.
	   Trailer cities have sprung up since the quake, with trailer
laundries, trailer barber shops and trailer flower stores. To some,
the very orderliness of the trailer towns suggest that their
inhabitants won't be going home any time soon.
	   In Assisi, St. Francis' birthplace, Franciscan brothers plan a
memorial Mass on Sunday in honor of the four who died at the
church.

Two Spanish cyclists expelled for failing blood test
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS quotes from Vitalicio coach, other riders tested,
CORRECTS spelling of Clavero &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SEGOVIA, Spain (AP) _ Two Spaniards were expelled from the
Vuelta a Espana Friday after failing a blood test, the state news
agency Efe reported.
	   Juan Carlos Dominguez and Daniel Clavero of the Vitalicio
Seguros team had an abnormally high count of red blood cells,
according to a test administered by the International Cycling Union
(UCI) prior to the 20th leg of the 22-stage race, the agency said.
	   The cyclists failed the test because their hematocrit level _
the proportion of red blood cells to the total volume of blood _
was measured above 50 percent, which is considered a health risk.
	   The UCI describes the blood test as a safety measure rather than
a doping control.
	   But the high red-blood cell count is an indication of possible
use of EPO, a synthetic hormone that stimulates the production of
red blood cells but for which there is no reliable test.
	   Clavero was in seventh place in the overall standings with just
three legs left to go.
	   His coach Javier Minguez said team doctors had tested
Vitalicio's riders on Thursday night and found their hematocrit
level below 50 percent. ``My conscience is clear,'' Minguez said.
	   The expulsion means Clavero and Dominguez will miss next month's
road World Championships in Valkenburg, Netherlands, because they
have to wait 15 days to have their blood tested again to see if the
hematocrit level is safe.
	   Other riders tested Friday include Vuela leader Abraham Olano of
Spain, Frenchman Laurent Jalabert, who is in second place, and
Spaniard Fernando Escartin, who is fourth.
	   Also tested was two-time defending champion Alex Zuelle, a Swiss
rider with Festina.

	   ZURICH (AP) _ Soccer's world governing body said Friday it was
prepared to take drastic measures to ensure a breakaway European
Super League never gets off the ground.
	   FIFA president Sepp Blatter said soccer authorities could
suspend national associations whose teams take part in any Super
League.
	   ``The last issue FIFA would have would be to suspend the
national association that the club is a part of,'' Blatter said
following FIFA's two-day executive committee meeting. ``The
national association would then suspend that club.
	   ``If the national associations are suspended, then all the clubs
are suspended. Then the principle of solidarity would prevail and
everyone would come back to the family.''
	   The national association would still remain suspended after
banning the errant team, as it is up to the domestic bodies to reel
the club back into the FIFA family, said FIFA spokesman Keith
Cooper.
	   The clubs could not participate in international competition,
including UEFA Cup, Cup Winners Cup and Champions' League. National
teams would also be banned from international play, including the
European Championships and World Cup.
	   FIFA was quick to insist that talk of such suspensions was
premature.
	   ``All this speculation and hypothesizing is really just
hogwash,'' said Cooper. ``This Super League doesn't exist and
likely never will.
	   ``A steady diet of Manchester United and Barcelona would get
boring,'' insisted Cooper. ``You can't live off caviar alone, you
need the bread and butter. The value of such a match-up is its
rarity.''
	   The proposed Super League, conceived by a Milan-based marketing
firm Media Partners, involves the biggest names in European soccer,
including Bayern Munich, Ajax, Inter and AC Milan, Manchester
United, Arsenal and Real Madrid. Organizers hope the league could
kick off in the year 2000.
	   ``We continue to develop the project with Europe's leading clubs
and we are perfectly happy to discuss it with FIFA,'' a Media
Partners spokesman said Friday. ``As things stand, FIFA have had no
detailed briefing on the project and are not in a position to
criticize it.''

Truck packed with school children goes off cliff in Peru, killing

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ A truck packed with school children and
parents on a field trip plummeted off a cliff on a remote highway
in Peru's northern Andes mountains, killing 26 and injuring 15,
police said Friday.
	   Most of the dead were children between 11 and 12 years old from
the primary school in village of Nueva Libertad, 465 miles (750
kilometers) north of Lima, in the department of Cajamarca, although
exact numbers were not yet available. Eight children were in
serious condition.
	   The children and their parents were on a trip to the country to
celebrate ``Spring Day'' on Thursday.
	   Bodies were flung from the open-top truck over 330 feet (100
meters) of mountainside, police said.
	   The truck had a capacity of 20 but was carrying 41 people,
police said.
	   Its motor apparently failed as it climbed a steep mountainside.
	   The truck came began racing backwards out of control, plunging
into a 330-foot (100-meter) deep ravine, said survivor Isidro
Castillo, 38, who saved himself by leaping from the back of the
truck.
	   Castillo said he saw a man who had lost his wife, brother and
two children sobbing beside the twisted wreckage.
	   Police took hours to reach the remote accident site.
	   In rural areas of Peru, people often travel in aging cargo
trucks on potholed mountains roads. Deadly accidents are common.

Dow trims losses; Asian and European markets down
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES Dow recovering much of its losses, broader market
indicators mixed, UPDATES European markets. &QL; 
 &UR; By BRUCE MEYERSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks slipped in skittish Wall Street trading
Friday, extending a global selloff and pushing the Dow industrials
below 8,000, on worries about the growing damage from economic
crises in Asia and Russia.
	   Traders were unnerved this week by the dlrs 3.5 billion private
bailout of a major hedge fund. Adding to the anxiety was the
disclosure from United Bank of Switzerland that market turmoil had
left it with huge losses this quarter. There are worries about
where the next flashpoint would emerge.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, which fell 152.42 on Thursday,
dropped an additional 112 points in the early going, then briefly
rose into positive territory before dropping again. The Dow was off
24.72 at 7,977.27 by late morning in trading that was slower than
Thursday's pace.
	   Broader market indicators were mixed.
	   The losses since Thursday threatened to wipe out the
257.21-point surge by the Dow on Wednesday, when Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan signaled interest rate cuts are likely.
	   In Asia, the key market indicator dropped 3.4 percent in Tokyo,
where traders also are upset by a political dispute over
legislation to rescue Japan's ailing financial system. Shares also
fell 1.7 percent in Hong Kong.
	   In London, Europe's biggest stock market, the main index was
down 2 percent in late trading, above the day's lows. The key index
was down 2.1 percent in Paris and 1.8 percent in Frankfurt,
Germany.
	   Much of the uncertainty resulted from the near-collapse of
Long-Term Capital Management LP, a business known as a hedge fund
that manages investments for the wealthy.
	   The Federal Reserve Bank of New York on Wednesday orchestrated a
bailout by a consortium of banks and brokerage firms because of
concern that the failure of Long-Term Capital would jeopardize the
nation's financial system. The fund had more than dlrs 90 billion
invested in complex bets in financial markets around the world.
	   The rescue has generated fears that more losses are possible at
other financial institutions, traders said.

Netherlands leads 2-0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EINDHOVEN, Netherlands (AP) _ Paul Haarhuis and Jan Siemerink
gave the Netherlands to a 2-0 lead over Ecuador on Friday and put
it on the brink of retaining its Davis Cup World Group status.
	   The Dutchman conceded just seven games each as Haarhuis routed
Nicolas Lapentti 6-2, 6-3, 6-2 and Siemerink outclassed Luis
Morejon 6-3, 6-3, 6-1.
	   The top-ranked Dutch doubles pair of Haarhuis and Jacco Eltingh
will have a chance to wrap up the tie on Saturday against Lapentti
and 38-year-old veteran Andres Gomez.
	   Siemerink's form this year has taken him No. 20 in the ATP Tour
rankings and his dominant serve-volley performance produced nine
games at love and 14 aces.
	   Morejon earned only two break points, both in the second game of
the second set, when Siemerink saved them with aces.
	   The Haarhuis-Lapentti rubber was expected to be more
competetive, pitting No. 58 on the ATP TYour rankings against No.
65, but Lapentti seemed ill at ease with the fast indoor Supreme
surface.
	   Haarhuis started sharply and stormed to 5-1 lead, then dropped
his serve but bounced back in the next game to convert his first
set point with a delicate down-the-line backhand pass.
	   After that, Lapentti never looked likely to recover.

Man given life sentence instead of son with similar name
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ A blind Indian villager with a son of
similar name spent 13 months in jail after being convicted for a
murder because the victim's family had misspelled the son's name in
a police complaint, an attorney said Friday.
	   Munna Lal, 53, was declared guilty of killing his
daughter-in-law on the basis of the complaint but the woman's
family meant Munni Lal _ his son and her husband _ attorney
Virendra Bhatia said.
	   Illiterate farmer Munna Lal, who lives near Bahraich town in
India's most populous Uttar Pradesh state, was too poor to afford
an appeal in a higher court.
	   When he came to know of the complainant's blunder, Bhatia moved
the state's high court on behalf of Munna Lal earlier this year. On
Thursday, a judge in Lucknow, the state's capital, ordered the
convict be released immediately, the attorney said.
	   Munni Lal, who allegedly battered his wife Lalli Devi in 1994
with the help of four other men, is absconding. A fresh trial will
begin now, after Munna Lal's name is replaced with Munni Lal in the
complainant's First Information Report, Bhatia said.

Despite NATO threats, Serbia pledges to fight ``terrorists''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Despite NATO threats to launch air
strikes, Serbia pledged Friday to fight on until ethnic Albanian
resistance in Kosovo has been uprooted.
	   In a draft resolution proposed to the Yugoslav parliament the
Serbian government said ``wiping out and uprooting terrorism ... in
Kosovo is the top patriotic and national priority'' and Serbia will
use all means necessary to achieve that goal.
	   Serbian authorities, who launched a violent crack down on
Kosovo's majority ethnic Albanians, consider all demand
independence and resist Serbian troops to be terrorists.
	   Serbia is the dominant republic in the Yugoslav federation.
	   The Serbian parliament meets next Monday and is expected to
adopt the resolution by an overwhelming majority.
	   Backed by a tough U.N. resolution, NATO instructed its generals
Thursday to prepare for air strikes unless Slobodan Milosevic, the
Yugoslav president, halts attacks against the remnants of the
secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The Serbian government said Serbia is ``embittered'' by the
``pressures from certain members of the international community''
who are ``suggesting measures which are directly threatening
Yugoslavia's sovereignty and territorial integrity.''
	   It called for a negotiated solution for Kosovo, promising
``self-rule, or autonomy'' to the majority ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo. But it rejected any talk about the province's independence
from Serbia, the main goal of most Kosovo Albanians.
	   The resolution, carried by state-run Tanjug news agency also
called for the lifting of economic and political sanctions imposed
by the United States and the European Union for Milosevic's
exaggerated use of force in Kosovo.

Opposition suspends cooperation with Tajik government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ The Tajik opposition announced
Friday that it was suspending cooperation with the Tajik government
and participation in reconciliation efforts following the killing
of one of its leaders.
	   Otakhon Latifi, 62, was shot and killed in Dushanbe on Tuesday.
His killing was another blow to peace in Tajikistan, a poor,
mountainous country that has been torn by civil strife since
breaking away from the Soviet Union seven years ago.
	   Latifi had returned to the Central Asian country a year ago
following peace accords that ended the five-year civil war between
Tajikistan's hard-line government and the opposition.
	   Since then, he had chaired a panel for legal issues under the
National Reconciliation Commission, which has been working to
stabilize the former Soviet republic.
	   As part of the peace plan, Tajik President Emomali Rakhmonov
appointed several opposition leaders to key Cabinet posts and
opposition fighters have been incorporated into the Tajik armed
forces.
	   On Friday, the Unified Tajik Opposition said it would not take
part in the Cabinet or Reconciliation Commission's work until
Latifi's murderer was arrested and opposition leaders were given
security guarantees.

In Russian Far East, long-running political feud drags down region
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Available &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (AP) _ Kremlin intrigues grab the headlines,
but perhaps Russia's fiercest political battle in recent years has
been waged in this eastern port city between the theatrical mayor
and the hard-line governor.
	   The no-holds-barred struggle between regional Gov. Yevgeny
Nazdratenko and Vladivostok Mayor Viktor Cherepkov is expected to
take a new turn on Sunday when the city holds a mayoral election.
	   Cherepkov has been campaigning for re-election, but a court
ruled Thursday that the mayor may not run again because he
illegally paid for his campaign with city money.
	   The mayor is appealing, and whatever the outcome, it's likely to
add another colorful chapter to a feud that's already seen armed
raids, bitter recriminations, and allegations of massive
corruption.
	   The political mayhem also has contributed to the inept
management and economic stagnation that plagues Vladivostok despite
the region's abundant natural resources and strategic location on
the Pacific Rim.
	   The feud has grown intensely personal, and neither man plans to
give in.
	   ``If I give up, those for whom I serve as an example will never
take a stand of principle and we will live like animals,''
Cherepkov said recently. ``The criminal world and the corrupt power
will have the final victory.''
	   The governor, meanwhile, said that the mayor ``belongs in an
insane asylum.''
	   When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Vladivostok appeared to
be one of Russia's best candidates for prosperity.
	   A major naval port closed to the outside world during Soviet
times, the Vladivostok region possesses oil, minerals and timber
for export, and is well-positioned to carry out robust commerce
with nearby nations such as Japan, China and South Korea.
	   Yet the regional economy was collapsing even before the latest
economic crisis hit Russia. The two warring political leaders have
blamed each other for unpaid wages to workers, chronic power cuts,
and frequent labor protests.
	   The feud, seen largely as a personality clash, boiled over in
1994 when Nazdratenko booted the mayor from office on corruption
charges, sending in riot police to make sure that Cherepkov was
removed.
	   But Cherepkov fought back, and President Boris Yeltsin
reinstated him as mayor in 1996 after the courts found him innocent
of corruption.
	   During his corruption trial, the courts ordered Cherepkov to
undergo psychiatric testing. The mayor was undaunted.
	   ``I have conclusions from a number of doctors that say I am
healthy,'' Cherepkov said.
	   Cherepkov portrays himself as a reformist mayor who courts
foreign investors and wants to repair Vladivostok's shoddy
infrastructure. He even seems to relish his reputation for odd
behavior.
	   ``If you look at all the dirty doings and political
provocations, you will see that I always make the move that leaves
my opponents looking foolish,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, Nazdratenko, is seen as an unreformed Soviet-style
leader who thinks Vladivostok's salvation would be a resumption of
the large federal subsidies that have long since dried up.
	   These days, the two sides rarely even speak to each other.
	   ``To my disappointment, we can't get in contact with the mayor's
office,'' said Vice Governor Vladimir Rud, an ally of the governor.
``City Hall ignores our invitations to meet, or sends someone
incompetent who can't give us intelligent answers.''

U.S. fighter jet crashes into Mediterranean; pilot ejects safely
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GAETA, Italy (AP) _ A U.S. Navy pilot ejected safely Friday
before his fighter jet crashed into the western Mediterranean, the
6th Fleet command said.
	   The F/A-18 Hornet went into the water 80 miles (130 kilometers)
off Toulon, France, about 20 miles (30 kilometers) from its
carrier, the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower.
	   A helicopter retrieved the pilot, the 6th Fleet said in a
statement. The Navy did not release the name of the pilot, who it
said was in good condition.
	   The cause of the accident is under investigation, the Navy said.
	   The Eisenhower is taking part in French-sponsored military
exercises in the western Mediterranean, said the 6th Fleet, which
is based in Gaeta, 50 miles (80 kilometers) northwest of Naples.

	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ The Hungarian government has agreed to
bid jointly with Austria to host the 2004 European Championship,
the Nemzeti Sport daily reported Friday.
	   Earlier this month, Economics Minister Attila Chikan expressed
doubts about financing the project, which is expected to cost
between 15 billion and 20 billion forints (dlrs 70 million and 85
million).
	   Prime Minister Viktor Orban, however, is a former junior league
soccer player and fan of the game. His cabinet voted Thursday to
support the bid.
	   The deadline for bid submissions is Sept. 30.
	   Other bidders for the championship finals are Spain, Portugal
and Switzerland.
	   UEFA is expected to announce the winner in July.
	   Orban's first foreign visit after his May election victory was
to Paris, where he watched the final of the World Cup as the guest
of President Jacques Chirac.

`La Nina' may be fueling Georges and future hurricanes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The infrequent weather phenomenon La Nina
may be fueling Hurricane Georges that had already killed 300 people
in a Caribbean rampage before it hit the Florida Keys Friday, the
U.N. environment agency said.
	   The United Nations Environmental Programme said in a statement
that the unusual drop in Pacific Ocean temperatures could be the
reason for Georges' powerful winds that have reached 105 mph (160
kph) in some areas and could signal more dangerous storms to come.
	   ``Hurricane Georges is a typical storm for this time of year,''
the statement quoted UNEP's Chief of Atmosphere Unit Peter Usher as
saying. ``But La Nina is now developing, and an important feature
is that it often enhances normal seasonal weather ... La Nina may
be making conditions favorable for frequent and dangerous Caribbean
hurricanes like Georges.''
	   In a summit hosted by UNEP in Boulder, Colorado in July, the
U.N. agency for the first time tried to identify the La Nina
patterns in order to more accurately forecast what kind of effects
they may have and how societies can be better prepared.
	   La Nina, or Little Girl in Spanish, is a result of below normal
drops in Pacific Ocean temperatures and is often referred to as the
opposite of the El Nino phenomenon, which is caused by abnormal
warming in the Central and Eastern Equatorial stretch of the
Pacific Oceans.
	   El Nino has been blamed over the past year for unusually intense
drought, rainfalls and subsequent floodings around the globe.
	   ``El Nino is now over and the other side of the coin, the less
frequent La Nina, is under way,'' said UNEP Executive Director
Klaus Teopfer. ``If La Nina develops how we think it might, then
the concern is that the frequency of storms like Georges might
increase.''
	   Georges reached the Florida coast Friday from Cuba after killing
over 300 people in the Caribbean. More than one million residents
have been urged to leave their homes in coastal and low lying areas
of the Florida Keys.

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ A truck packed with school children and
parents on a field trip plummeted off a cliff on a remote highway
in Peru's northern Andes mountains, killing 26 and injuring 15,
police said Friday.
	   Most of the dead were children between 11 and 12 years old from
the primary school in village of Nueva Libertad, 465 miles (750
kilometers) north of Lima, in the department of Cajamarca, although
exact numbers were not yet available. Eight children were in
serious condition.
	   The children and their parents were on a trip to the country to
celebrate ``Spring Day'' on Thursday afternoon.
	   Bodies were flung from the open-top truck over 330 feet (100
meters) of mountainside, said police, who were waiting for
investigators to examine the wreckage before removing bodies. They
said that most of the bodies appeared to be children.
	   The truck had a capacity of 20 but was carrying 41 people,
police said.
	   Its motor apparently failed as it climbed a steep mountainside.
	   The truck began racing backwards out of control, plunging into a
330-foot (100-meter) deep ravine, said survivor Isidro Castillo,
38, who saved himself by leaping from the back of the truck.
	   Castillo said he saw a man who had lost his wife, brother and
two children sobbing beside the twisted wreckage. Two of the man's
children were among those in serious condition, he said.
	   Police took hours to reach the remote accident site.
	   In rural areas of Peru, people often travel in aging cargo
trucks on potholed mountains roads. Deadly accidents are common.

EU finance chiefs downplay threat from world turmoil
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ European Union finance chiefs on Friday
downplayed fears that the spreading international economic turmoil
will derail growth within the EU as it prepares to launch its
single currency.
	   ``It wouldn't be right to be overly pessimistic in light of the
global environment and to assume that we will see a global
recession,'' German central bank president Hans Tietmeyer said
ahead a two-day meeting of top EU finance officials.
	   The Bundesbank president said the market turmoil was not
symptomatic of worldwide problems, but rather reflected ``a lack of
trust in the policies of individual countries.''
	   Europe's central bank governors were scheduled to join finance
ministers from the 15 EU nations Saturday in Vienna's Hofburg
Imperial Palace for talks that were expected to focus on the EU's
response to the Russian crisis.
	   ``The EU can do everything in its power to stop Russia feeling
isolated,'' said German Economics Minister Guenther Rexrodt. ``What
we cannot do is give fresh cash.''
	   Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International
Monetary Fund was also scheduled to attend the talks on how to help
Russia. The IMF is holding back payment of the next installments of
a dlrs 22.6 billion loan package until it is satisfied Moscow has a
sound economic plan.
	   The 15 EU finance ministers opened the two-day meeting Friday,
focusing on final preparations for the birth of the euro, which 11
EU nations will have as their shared currency on Jan. 1.
	   EU Commission President Jacques Santer said the talks would
concentrate on how the euro-zone would be represented in
international organizations such as the IMF or the G-7 group of
world economic powers.
	   French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn is expected to
propose the three euro-zone nations in the G-7 _ France, Germany
and Italy _ take turns to represent the whole bloc. But with
smaller nations resisting that as handing too much influence to the
big three, Santer indicated the issue will not be resolved in
Vienna.
	   ``This will certainly keep us busy in the coming months as well
because we still have a lot to do,'' he said.
	   The ministers considered deadlines by which the 11 euro nations
will aim to balance their budgets. EU Finance Commissioner
Yves-Thibault de Silguy suggested 2001 or 2002 as possible target,
but said he was unlikely they would announce a date here.
	   Britain and Luxembourg were set to resist proposals for an

Henry Kissinger fingers speculation as threat to globalism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Former Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger wrapped up an international business leaders' conference
Friday, warning that speculation poses a threat to global
stability.
	   ``Nineteenth century laissez-faire produced Marxism and the
present day attitude is producing excessive speculation, which in
turn will inhibit direct investments,'' Kissinger said. ``Unless
some mechanism is found to cope with excessive speculation, the
international system will become more and more unstable.''
	   The former U.S. secretary of state was speaking at the close of
a two-day conference on ``Creating Wealth in the Global Economy,''
sponsored by the American ``Fortune'' magazine. More than 100 top
business executives from 35 countries attended the forum.
	   The meeting offers Hungary a welcome opportunity to persuade
western business leaders that they ought not view Eastern Europe in
bloc terms and flee the region when problems arise in Moscow.
	   Analysts believe that three billion dollars or more have been
withdrawn from Hungary's stock and bond markets by western
investors in recent weeks because of nervousness about Russia.
	   Kissinger said the crises in the Asian and Russian economies are
merely symptoms of the problem facing the global economy and called
for a new approach. He urged business to be sensitive to national
history, tradition, and the suffering of people as the global
economy shifts gears.
	   ``The mistake is to see the international economy as a single
global market,'' he said.
	   Kissinger, who was Secretary of State 1973-1974, was also
received by President Arpad Goencz, Prime Minister Viktor Orban and
Finance Minister Zsigmond Jarai.
	   The Russian crisis dominated discussions at the meeting,
although a special workshop on the issue was canceled, as the
Russian participants failed to come at the last minute.

U.S. general consulate in Hamburg still on alert for attack
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with German authorities examining computer records
linked to bin Laden, earlier travel to Germany. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Bavarian authorities are examining
computer disks, some with encoded data, that they believe contain
records of secret bank accounts used by Saudi terrorist suspect
Osama bin Laden, a magazine reported Friday.
	   Focus magazine said the disks were seized from Mamdouh Mahmoud
Salim, a suspected bin Laden aide who was arrested in Germany on a
U.S. warrant last week.
	   Bavarian Interior Ministry spokesman Michael Ziegler would
confirm only that authorities confiscated diskettes and CD-ROMs
from an apartment outside Munich where Salim had been staying,
including some in Arabic.
	   Salim's arrest has raised concerns of reprisals on German soil.
The U.S. consulate general in Hamburg was under increased security
for a second day Friday after being threatened with an attack.
	   Security was tightened at U.S. installations worldwide after the
Aug. 7 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Bin
Laden, a Saudi dissident, is wanted by U.S. officials for those
attacks.
	   Salim, 40, of Sudan, is being held on a U.S. warrant charging
him with conspiracy to kill Americans and conspiracy to use weapons
of mass destruction.
	   He has traveled to Germany at least four times in recent years,
Ziegler said. Focus said Salim switched his family and first names
on his visa application at the German embassy in Khartoum.
	   At the Hamburg consulate, dozens of police and several armored
personnel carriers guarded the white, palace-like building, which
stands near a tributary of the Alster river. A consulate employee
said the Hamburg offices were open and there were no plans to
close.
	   Police have blocked the road to the consulate, and a police boat
patrolled the waters nearby. Police divers have been checking the
river and air traffic controllers have been instructed to notify
police of any unauthorized flights over the area.
	   The extra security will continue at least until Monday, when
police plan to consider relieving some of the dozens of extra
officers, police spokesman Reinhard Fallack said Friday.
	   He said authorities learned of the threat early this week from a
``first-class source,'' although he has refused to comment on who
investigators believed was planning the attack. No arrests have
been made.
	   In what appeared to be an unrelated incident, police Thursday
arrested a man who called in bomb threats to a U.S. air force base
and nearby U.S. military hospital in southwest Germany.
	   The Ramstein Air Base and Landstuhl Regional Medical Center
increased security after the threats at 8:30 a.m. Thursday. The
caller was arrested within hours and charged with making a hoax. He
confessed to making the threats from his mobile telephone because
he was ``bored'' on the drive to work, said Gert Fischer, a police
spokesman.

IMF team wraps up visit, but no sign of loan money

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's top economic official quit his job in
anger Friday, and the new government got some bad news from the
International Monetary Fund: no new loan installments this month.
	   Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime minister in charge of
economic policy, quit after President Boris Yeltsin announced the
appointment of a holdover finance minister who served in the
previous two administrations.
	   Shokhin said the minister, Mikhail Zadornov, might know finance,
but ``his professionalism has not been confirmed in the past
month,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Zadornov, a 35-year-old economist, is considered one of the only
members of the new Cabinet who is fully committed to
market-oriented economic reforms.
	   However, he carries the baggage of the economic team that
presided over Russia's decision to devalue the ruble and
effectively default on its loans last month.
	   Shokhin said he doesn't intend to remain as a ``fig leaf'' for
international investors when the Russian government is ``occupied
by people who have already deceived investors once.''
	   The difficulty of Russia's position was highlighted earlier in
the day when a team from the International Monetary Fund left
Moscow without recommending the next installment of a dlrs 22.6
billion loan package.
	   The IMF said the team would return on Oct. 12 for additional
negotiations _ a postponement that was disappointing to Russian
officials, if not entirely unexpected.
	   The IMF has stressed in recent weeks that it expects to see
signs of an enduring commitment to market-oriented economic reforms
before it agrees to release any more of the money it promised
Russia in July. So far, new Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and his
team have been slow to embrace the kinds of reforms the IMF is
seeking.
	   After it released the first loan installment in July, the IMF
said future installments would depend on Russia's commitment to
improving tax collection and cutting social welfare costs.
	   The Russian Tax Service announced Friday that tax collection
continued to plummet in September after disappointing August
collections of 12 billion rubles (dlrs 755 million), 2 billion
rubles (dlrs 125 million) below expectations.
	   Primakov has said repeatedly that he intends to balance social
welfare needs with purely economic ones.
	   The government effectively acknowledged Friday that it had
released 3 billion rubles (dlrs 188 million) into the economy last
week in the sort of inflationary move abhorred by Western
economists.
	   The Central Bank said the country's overall money supply totaled
170.3 billion (dlrs 10.7 billion) Monday, up from 167.3 billion
rubles (dlrs 10.6 billion) one week earlier.
	   The new government continued to take shape, with Yeltsin
announcing 10 Cabinet-level appointments, including that of
Zadornov. Yeltsin has now appointed 20 Cabinet members, leaving 10
positions to be filled.
	   Yeltsin dismissed the previous government headed by Sergei
Kiriyenko as the economy began to unravel last month, saying the
country needed a more experienced leader to shepherd it through the
crisis.
	   Primakov seems committed to a middle course between the sort of
radical reform efforts that many in the West have been urging and
the Soviet-style retrenchment that Yeltsin's leftist opposition
might prefer.
	   In other developments Friday:
	   _ A plan to pay out money to Russians from their frozen bank
accounts won't begin until Nov. 30, two weeks later than previously
planned, news reports said.
	   _ Primakov said his government would try to clean up the
criminal activity that is pervasive in the country's unregulated
``shadow economy.''
	   _ ITAR-Tass reported that Russia's foreign trade for the first
six months of this year was down 5 percent from the same period
last year _ with exports dropping 13 percent while imports actually
rose 8.6 percent. Imports have all but ceased since the economic
crisis began.
	   _ Russian stocks ended lower in almost non-existent trading,
with volume totaling just dlrs 163,350.

Following Northwest strike, financial turmoil, Dutch airline issues
</HEADLINE>
profit warning

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ KLM Royal Dutch Airlines issued a
profit warning Friday for its second quarter and fiscal year ending
March 1999, saying revenues have been hit by the global financial
crisis and the recent pilots' strike at Northwest Airlines.
	   In a news release, the Dutch carrier said that costs related to
the strike at Northwest, KLM's U.S. partner, will result in a
one-off charge of 50 million guilders (dlrs 26.6 million) in its
fiscal second quarter ending Sept. 12.
	   KLM said the full-year earnings will also be ``less favorable''
due to weaker projections for volume and yields.
	   The airline said a deterioration of the global economy has
slowed growth of business volume to less than 1 percent, compared
to just over 1 percent in the first quarter. The warning was issued
after the Dutch Stock Exchange closed.
	   KLM is the third major Dutch company in a week to issue a profit
warning, following in the footsteps of Anglo-Dutch oil giant Shell
and electronics company Philips.
	   For its fiscal year ending March 1999, KLM said that earnings
per share will be in the range of 6.50 guilders (dlrs 3.46) to 7.00
guilders (dlrs 3.72), compared with 8.10 guilders (dlrs 4.31) a
year earlier.

Canada challenges United States over ban on cattle-carrying trucks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Canada has challenged the United States at the
World Trade Organization over a refusal by some U.S. states to
allow the entry or transit of Canadian trucks carrying cattle, hogs
and grain.
	   For a week, North Dakota and South Dakota have been stopping
trucks carrying the Canadian grain or livestock into the states.
	   Drivers are asked if they have documentation that the grain is
free of disease and that the livestock is free of certain drugs not
permitted in the United States.
	   South Dakota has been turning away trucks without the
documentation, while North Dakota has allowed them to continue
through the state.
	   Canadian trade officials contend these measures adversely affect
their grain and livestock imports and have formally requested
consultations with U.S. trade officials through the WTO.
	   If the two sides fail to sort out their differences within 60
days, the complaining government can ask the WTO to set up a panel
to adjudicate the dispute.
	   Also Friday, the 15-nation European Union requested
consultations with Argentina over so-called countervailing duties
the Argentineans have imposed on wheat gluten imports from the
European Union.
	   The Europeans contend that the procedures which led to the
imposition of the duties violate WTO accords relating to subsidies.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. trade representative in Geneva, Rita Hayes,
formally confirmed to a WTO meeting on Friday that a new series of
talks to further free up world trade will be launched in the United
States late next year.
	   Ministers will attend a conference to be held from November 30
to December 3 1999. The location for the event has not yet been
decided, Hayes said.

Serb police declares end of latest offensive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police Friday declared their
latest offensive against Kosovo Albanian separatists had ended,
saying dozens of Albanians had been ``liquidated'' and their bases
destroyed.
	   ``The police successfully wiped out Albanian
separatist-terrorist gangs on Cicavica Mountain,'' Col. Bozidar
Filic, spokesman for Kosovo's Serbian police told the
government-run media center.
	   ``Several terrorist bases were destroyed and dozens Albanian
terrorists were liquidated,'' Filic said. The Serbian government
considers all Albanians fighting for independence to be terrorists.
	   He said 325 ethnic Albanians were arrested in the four-day
action, and a commander of local Kosovo Liberation Army units,
Fehmi Ladrovci, was killed. Filic claimed there were no civilian
casualties and that the refugees were returning to the attacked
villages just northwest of Kosovo's capital Pristina.
	   It was not clear whether the end of the offensive against ethnic
Albanian separatists on Mt. Cicavica was declared because of a
strong NATO warning Thursday of air strikes if the Serbian
crackdown in Kosovo continues.

in the United Nations, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said Friday
he is entitled to declare a state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
in May.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, gave an
upbeat assessment of the negotiations with the Palestinians on a
West Bank troop withdrawal, according to Israeli radio reports.
	   Israel army radio quoted Netanyahu as confirming for the first
time officially that he was ready to withdraw from 13 percent of
the West Bank, as proposed by the United States. The report also
quoted a senior Israeli official as saying that an agreement with
the Palestinians could be signed as early as two weeks from now.
	   Netanyahu spoke to Israeli reporters in New York.
	   Arafat is to address the U.S. General Assembly on Monday. His
spokesman, Nabil Abourdeneh, told the Voice of Palestine radio that
the Palestinian leader will raise the statehood issue in his speech
and seek world support for the fledgling Palestinian entity.
	   Many countries are expected to recognize a Palestinian state,
and Netanyahu has been trying to thwart the Palestinian campaign
for international backing.

Poll finds support for returning Elgin Marbles to Greece

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A plurality of Britons would support the return of
the Elgin Marbles to Greece, according to an opinion poll published
Friday which also discovered substantial apathy about the issue.
	   The Elgin Marbles are sculptures taken mainly from the Parthenon
in 1812 and now kept at the British Museum. The Greek government
has pressed for their return for many years.
	   The polling organization MORI asked 1,823 adults how they would
vote if there were a referendum of returning the sculptures.
Thirty-nine percent said they would vote yes, 15 percent would vote
to keep them in Britain, but 28 percent were undecided and a
further 18 percent said they would not vote.
	   The margin of error was about three percentage points.
	   In Athens, Greek Culture Minister Evangelos Venizelos called the
poll a ``clear message'' to the British government.
	   ``The stereotypical refusal of British governments does not seem
to have the support of British public opinion and the true desire
of the majority of the British Parliament,'' he added.

Ethiopia accuses Eritrea of ethnic cleansing; U.S. delegation

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Ethiopia has accused Eritrea of
carrying out ethnic cleansing through systematic deportation of
Ethiopians living in Eritrea.
	   ``The Eritrean government seems determined to ethnic cleanse
Ethiopians in Eritrea by systematically but indiscriminately
deporting Ethiopians after making life intolerable for them,''
government spokeswoman Selome Tadesse said in a statement Friday.
	   She said Eritrea had not given any reason for the action and
said some Ethiopians had died in the process. The statement did not
give a figure.
	   Quoting figures from the Ethiopian Disaster Prevention and
Preparedness Commission, she said 24,970 Ethiopians have been
deported from Eritrea since a border dispute erupted into a brief
but intense shooting war between the two Horn of Africa nations in
May.
	   But Eritrea Friday denied deporting any Ethiopians. A Foreign
Affairs ministry statement said 16,600 Ethiopians had left the
country of their own accord since the fighting broke out.
	   The policy of Eritrea, the statement said, is that all Ethiopian
nationals who had been living in the country prior to the outbreak
of hostilities are welcome to remain and that legal action will be
taken against anyone who harrasses them.
	   The statement said Eritrea has called for an independent inquiry
into the allegations of maltreatment of Ethiopians in Eritrea.
	   All attempts to mediate between the two countries have failed. A
delegation headed by former U.S. national security adviser Anthony
Lake is expected in the region this weekend.
	   The Ethiopians say they are glad he is coming; the Eritreans
blame earlier U.S. peace efforts for complicating things.
	   At the beginning of the crisis, Eritrea expelled a few hundred
Ethiopians every week. But Ethiopia says the numbers are growing.
	   Ethiopia expelled another 2,000 Eritreans early this week, most
of them the wives and children of Eritrean nationals expelled
earlier for allegedly raising funds for the Eritreans war effort
and spying for their government.
	   Many of those expelled earlier were successful businessmen who
had to leave everything behind.
	   Ethiopia says it has expelled about 8,000 Eritreans, but Eritrea
puts the figure at 20,000.
	   Political analysts in the Ethiopian capital say the stepped up
war of words and the mass expulsion of each other's nationals can
only lead to renewed fighting between the formerly friendly
neighbors in the Horn of Africa.
	   Both countries settled into a ``no war, no peace'' situation
after three days of bloody ground fighting along their long common
border and air raids against civilians and military targets.
	   A moratorium on fighting brokered by U.S President Bill Clinton
last June is still holding.
	   But in the meantime, both sides have dug in thousands of troops
in trenches and have purchased and moved to the front additional
tanks, artillery, multi-rocket launchers and other weapons.
	   Senior Ethiopian officials have repeatedly declared that all-
out war is inevitable unless Eritrea withdraws its troops from two
contested districts in northwestern Ethiopia they occupied in May.
	   The Organization of African Unity had been expected to discuss
the conflict this week, but an OAU spokesman said the 16 members of
the body's organ on conflict prevention and resolution were still
at the planning stage.

Ukrainian officials speak of possible change in currency trading
</HEADLINE>
band &QL; 
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian government officials indicated
Friday that the government-set trading band for the national
currency might be widened or abandoned altogether.
	   ``It's a possibility,'' Deputy Prime Minister Serhiy Tyhypko
said, commenting on a possible change in the corridor's limits, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   Ukraine's hryvna currency, hit by Russia's financial turmoil,
was trading at 3.33 to the U.S. dollar on Thursday.
	   The rate was close to the upper limit of the currency trading
corridor of 2.5 to 3.5 to the dollar introduced at the beginning of
September. However, the hryvna's black-market rate was already well
below 4 to the dollar Friday.
	   The trading corridor for the hryvna was announced after the
currency left the range of 1.8 to 2.25 to the dollar, which the
government had originally set as the hryvna's trading band for the
whole of 1988.
	   The former Soviet republic's currency has been falling slowly
since the start of Russia's crisis in mid-August, but sharply
increased its plunge over the past two weeks.
	   The hryvna's downfall quickened after the central bank had to
stop spending its reserves on defending the currency so as to
qualify for disbursement of further installments of a large
International Monetary Fund loan, approved in September.
	   In another sign that the hryvna might fall even further, Finance
Minister Ihor Mitiukov told Interfax on Friday that the government
should refrain from announcing a new trading band, but let the rate
float. He did not elaborate.
	   The Central Bank maintained the hryvna at about 2.1 to the
dollar until mid-August, massively spending its reserves in
response to the exodus of foreign investors from Ukraine's
financial market.
	   But the turmoil in Russia caused panic demand for dollars among
banks and the population, leaving the Central Bank unable to
stabilize the currency even after it imposed restrictions on dollar
purchases at the currency exchange.

	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Rescue workers pulled
more bodies Friday from the mud, water, and rubble left behind by
Hurricane Georges. At least 307 people died in the storm that
ravaged the Caribbean and was whipping through the Florida Keys.
	   American and French aid arrived Friday in the Dominican
Republic, including search and rescue teams, to help overwhelmed
Dominican authorities. There alone, Dominican and Red Cross
officials said 201 people died and scores were missing.
	   Reporters trying to reach the hard-hit Juan de la Maguana area,
120 miles (190 kilometers) west of the capital, Santo Domingo, were
told it was inaccessible by land because of damaged bridges.
Seventy-six of the bodies were recovered there on Thursday.
	   In Manomatuey, where a shelter was washed away Wednesday, three
more bodies were pulled from the muck to bring the deaths there _
not yet part of the official toll _ to at least eight. A woman's
bloated, blanched body also washed ashore along the capital's
seaside boulevard.
	   The death toll also rose in Haiti Friday from 42 to 87, and at
least 34 were missing.
	   Much of the housing is substandard on the impoverished island of
Hispaniola, shared by the Dominican Republic and Haiti. It was
unable to resist the pounding from Georges' ferocious 100 mph (160
kilometers) winds or the flooding from its torrential rains. Most
victims died in the floods and mudslides.
	   Dominican officials were criticized for opening shelters in
Santo Domingo only as the storm was hitting Tuesday; in Haiti
denuded mountains and unmaintained drainage systems were blamed for
widespread and deadly flooding there.
	   Meanwhile, the hurricane continued its onslaught. It blew
through Cuba on Wednesday and Thursday, and was lashing the Florida
Keys on Friday.
	   In Cuba, the government reported two people were electrocuted by
downed power wires, the Mexican news agency Notimex said. Coffee,
cacao and banana crops also were damaged and nearly 20,000 homes
were flooded in eastern Holguin province.
	   Three people were killed and two were missing in St. Kitts, two
died in Antigua and at least three deaths were attributed to the
storm in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, where officials
estimated damage of at least dlrs 2 billion. At least eight more
died of heart attacks and other health complications.
	   Curfews were in effect in St. Kitts and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
In St. Kitts, 85 percent of homes were damaged or destroyed,
schools and hospitals were damaged, and half the crucial sugar crop
was lost. About 2,500 were homeless.
	   Storm victims everywhere struggled to find water, food, ice and
other essentials to cope with their losses and the tropical heat.
	   In Puerto Rico, where 28,000 people were in shelters, the
Electric Energy Authority gradually began restoring power to some
neighborhoods. Water service in parts of San Juan resumed Friday.
	   Thousands lined up to buy ice while others waited in the hot sun
to fill jugs with water from government tanker trucks.
	   In the town of San Lorenzo, a 67-year-old woman collapsed and
died while waiting in line for an emergency assistance check. That
brought the death toll in Puerto Rico to three killed directly by
the hurricane and nine indirect deaths.
	   ``House after house is in terrible shape,'' Housing Secretary
Andrew Cuomo said after touring damaged neighborhoods.
	   Puerto Rico will get dlrs 39 million in new grants to repair
public housing and will be allowed to use for disaster relief more
than dlrs 300 million in other aid. previously aid previously
awarded for longer term development.
	   In Haiti, the U.N. Development Program donated dlrs 100,000 for
disaster relief and the U.S. donated water, food, blankets, sheets
and clothing. France sent a 60-member security team to help with
water purification and to treat the injured.
	   Some places in Cite Soleil, a seaside slum in Port-au-Prince
that is home to 200,000 people, remained chin-deep in water. The
number of tin-and-cardboard shacks lost was unknown.
	   In the Dominican Republic, rescuers searched frantically for
more victims and army helicopters and a U.S. Coast Guard C-130
airplane and helicopter searched the countryside.
	   More than 100,000 people lost homes, said President Leonel
Fernandez. Telephone lines were down throughout the country, and
hundreds of people were isolated by flooding. Airports in La Romana
and Puerto Plata were severely damaged.
	   Throughout Santo Domingo, people wandered with empty plastic
jugs searching for water to drink. Many had to settle for filthy
brown river water. ``I'm going to drink it. I know it's bad, but
there's nothing else,'' said Altagracia Duran.

To boost currency, government curtail imports, cracks down on
</HEADLINE>
traders &QL; 
 &UR; By ANGUS SHAW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The government imposed foreign exchange
restrictions Friday and doubled import duties on whisky,
electronics and other luxury goods in an effort to boost the
sagging national currency.
	   The Zimbabwe dollar closed at 32.4 per U.S. dollar, much
stronger than the record low rate of 37.8-1 a day earlier.
	   The exchange rate started the year at about 17 to 1.
	   Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa said the measures aimed to stop
the nation's hard currency reserves from being drained, and ``bring
about a modicum of stability in the foreign exchange market.''
	   The government also imposed a 10 percent surtax on imports such
as wines, toys, furniture, cars. Luxury goods already are taxed at
up to 80 percent of their normal sale price. A bottle of whisky
that now costs 220 Zimbabwe dollar (dlrs 7) was expected to sell
for almost double.
	   The government also restricted trading at foreign exchange
houses in an effort to curtail devaluation linked to currency
speculation. Forward contracts and prepayments, where importers pay
at a price pegged to the exchange rate on the date goods are
ordered, were suspended.
	   Murerwa said no new licenses were being issued, and the minimum
operating capital of existing agencies was being increased 10-fold
to dlrs 100,000.
	   That step was expected to drive less reputable agencies out of
business.
	   Tobacco and minerals are the nation's main foreign currency
earner.
	   Murerwa denied Friday the deployment of 2,800 combat troops with
warplanes and armor in Congo affected the currency's slide.
	   ``The impact of our intervention in the Congo is minimal. It is
not the reason for these fluctuations,'' he told reporters.

Arafat asserts right to declare state in May
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with Arafat quotes, aides
saying Arafat will raise the statehood issue in his U.N. speech,
Israeli legislator calling on Netanyahu to suspend negotiations,

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Heading into a diplomatic showdown with Israel
in the United Nations, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said Friday
he is entitled to declare a state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
in May.
	   Arafat is to address the U.S. General Assembly on Monday. His
spokesman, Nabil Abourdeneh, told the Voice of Palestine radio that
the Palestinian leader will raise the statehood issue in his speech
and seek world support for the fledgling Palestinian entity.
	   Many countries are expected to recognize a Palestinian state,
and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been trying to
thwart the Palestinian campaign for international backing.
	   In his Thursday speech to the General Assembly, Netanyahu warned
that a unilateral declaration of statehood in May would lead to the
``complete collapse of the (peace) process.''
	   Netanyahu said Israel would react harshly, but gave no details.
	   Uzi Landau, a senior legislator in Netanyahu's Likud Party,
demanded Friday that Israel immediately call off negotiations with
the Palestinians on a West Bank troop pullback.
	   Two Cabinet ministers, Shaul Yahalom and Rafael Eitan, said that
in response to a declaration of statehood, Israel must annex areas
of the West Bank and Gaza still under its control.
	   Israel has complete authority over one-third of Gaza and 70
percent of the West Bank.
	   Under the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreements, the five-year
period of Palestinian autonomy expires on May 4. By that time, the
two sides are to have negotiated a permanent peace accord that
would determine the nature and borders of the Palestinian entity.
	   With both sides still hung up over interim issues, such as a
staged Israeli troop pullback in the West Bank, it appears very
unlikely such an agreement can be concluded on deadline.
	   The Palestinians argue that once the interim period is over,
they have the right to declare a state. Israel says the peace
accords bar the two sides from taking unilateral steps, and that a
declaration of statehood is a major violation.
	   Setting the stage for his diplomatic battle with Netanyahu at
the United Nations in New York, Arafat said Friday during a
stopover in Liege, Belgium, that he would prefer a negotiated
settlement with Israel, but noted that the autonomy period expires
May 4.
	   After that date, Arafat said, ``we have the right to go in any
direction, including declaring our own independent state, which is
our priority, so as to advance the peace process.''
	   On Thursday night, Arafat's Cabinet also asserted that a state
would be declared in May. ``At the end of the interim period, it
(the Palestinian government) shall declare the establishment of a
Palestinian state on all Palestinian land occupied since 1967, with
Jerusalem as the eternal capital of the Palestinian state,'' the
Cabinet said in a statement.
	   Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza and traditionally Arab east
Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war.
	   The United States has been trying to persuade the Palestinians
to delay a declaration of statehood. Palestinian and U.S. officials
close to the talks on a West Bank troop withdrawal confirmed that
the issue has come up as a bargaining chip.
	   Earlier this month, U.S. negotiators told the Palestinians they
would seek Israeli concessions on security checks at a future
Palestinian airport if Arafat agreed to delay the declaration of
statehood, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The opening of the airport, widely seen as a major symbol of
Palestinian sovereignty, is long overdue because Israel and the
Palestinians disagree on how to monitor the influx of passengers
and cargo.

Ukraine's president signs ban on utilities price rises into law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ President Leonid Kuchma signed a bill
banning price rises for utilities and public transportation fees, a
news agency reported Friday.
	   Kuchma was forced to let the draft law enter into effect after
Ukraine's leftist-dominated parliament overrode his earlier veto on
the bill, the Interfax news agency said.
	   The government had planned to increase utility fees and to
cancel all state subsidies for utilities by the end of the year, at
the urging of the International Monetary Fund.
	   Ukrainians currently pay only 80 percent of the total cost of
utilities, which include apartment fees as well as payments for
gas, water and heating.
	   But lawmakers have insisted that any further rise in utilities
payments would only increase the population's mounting debt.
	   Ukrainians owed their government nearly 2.9 billion hryvna (dlrs
1.1 billion) for communal services as of July, and about half of
all debtors have not paid their bills for more than two months,
according to government statistics.

Vijah Singh, finding course easy, leads German Masters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOGNE, Germany (AP) _ Vijah Singh, playing his first European
event since capturing the PGA Championship, fired a 7-under-par 65
Friday to lead by a stroke at the halfway point of the German
Masters.
	   Singh, recording seven birdies, found the short course at the
dlrs 1.68 million event easy to solve in perfect weather conditions
as he went to 12-under 132 after an opening round of 67.
	   ``In the next few days there's going to a lot of birdies
played,'' Singh said. ''The course is beautiful, it also has nice
bunkers, but they are easy to go over.''
	   Singh, who has played almost non-stop since winning his first
major five weeks ago, was one stroke ahead of six players at
11-under 133.
	   The group included England's Lee Westwood and Scotland's Colin
Montgomerie, who are battling to finish the year as Europe's
leading money-winner.
	   Westwood, just dlrs 63,000 ahead of the Scotsman with three
events left to play, struggled with his putting but shot a 67.
Montgomerie, seeking a record sixth straight Order-of-Merit title,
ended with a 68.
	   Ireland's Padraig Harrington also was 11-under after posting a
torrid day's best of 64 at the Gut Laerchenhof course, where the
event was being played for the first time.
	   During the middle of his round, he nailed five straight birdies.
	   ``The course will be a lot more difficult with wind,'' said
Westwood, 25. ``But if I had putted better, a 62 would have been
possible.''
	   Sweden's Jarmo Sandelin and Robert Karlsson, along with
England's Steve Webster, completed the group at 11-under 133.
	   Singh, who won the German Open seven years ago in nearby
Duesseldorf, had a scorching start. He collected birdies on his
first three holes and had a total of five by his front nine.
	   ``The first nine holes speak for themselves. I feel comfortable
with my game and believe I'll keep playing good golf,'' said Singh,
looking for his 24th career title on various tours worldwide.
	   Germany's Bernhard Langer settled for a 69 for the second
straight day to fall six strokes back. The two-time Masters
champion, 41, hasn't claimed a title since winning the event last
year.
	   ``The younger players are coming on strong,'' said a frustrated
Langer. ``It's harder than ever to win a title.''

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Heading into a diplomatic showdown with Israel
in the United Nations, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said Friday
he is entitled to declare a state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
in May.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, gave an
upbeat assessment of the negotiations with the Palestinians on a
West Bank troop withdrawal, according to Israeli radio reports.
	   Israel army radio quoted Netanyahu as confirming for the first
time officially that he was ready to withdraw from 13 percent of
the West Bank, as proposed by the United States. The report also
quoted a senior Israeli official as saying that an agreement with
the Palestinians could be signed as early as two weeks from now.
	   Netanyahu spoke to Israeli reporters in New York.
	   Arafat is to address the U.S. General Assembly on Monday. His
spokesman, Nabil Abourdeneh, told the Voice of Palestine radio that
the Palestinian leader will raise the statehood issue in his speech
and seek world support for the fledgling Palestinian entity.
	   Many countries are expected to recognize a Palestinian state,
and Netanyahu has been trying to thwart the Palestinian campaign
for international backing.

Ultra-nationalist turned back from Bosnia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ An ultra-nationalist Serb leader,
whose troops fought in the Bosnian war, was banned from entering
Bosnia by Bosnian Serb police, his party said Friday.
	   It said that Vojislav Seselj, the leader of the Serbian Radical
Party, tried to attend his friends funeral in northern Bosnia
Thursday, but was turned back to Serbia by Bosnian Serb police.
	   The party claimed Seselj was banned from entering Bosnia by
orders from moderate Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic and her
Premier Milorad Dodik.
	   Seselj's party ally Nikola Poplasen was expected to be
proclaimed the winner over the incumbent Plavsic when final results
are announced in Bosnia's Sept. 12-13 elections.
	   The Radicals claimed that Seselj was turned away from Bosnia
because the moderates ``lost their heads after the election
defeat.''
	   International officials overseeing the elections had banned
Seselj from campaigning for Poplasen on the eve of the elections
because of his inflammatory speeches that ``attacked the
territorial integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina.''
	   Seselj's dreaded ``Chetnik'' paramilitary troops fought rival
Muslims and Croats during Bosnia's 3 1/2-year war.

Soldier gives up, five days after shooting comrades
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian serviceman gave himself up Friday, five
days after he allegedly killed two comrades and wounded a third
near the country's main nuclear weapons arsenal, a news agency
reported.
	   Also Friday, the Interfax news agency reported that 26 sailors
in Russia's Northern Fleet had confined themselves in a ward room
aboard their ship for four days, in a protest against what they
called ``unbearable service conditions.''
	   Russia's military has been plagued by increasing acts of protest
and violence as members of the beleaguered service chafe _ and
sometimes snap _ under miserable conditions that include late pay,
scant food and brutal hazing.
	   The serviceman who reportedly gave up Friday had been on the
loose since Monday, when he shot the three colleagues in the Ural
Mountains city of Ozyorsk, home to Russia's main nuclear arsenal.
	   There were no immediate details about his surrender, which was
reported by Interfax.
	   The Northern Fleet protest was reported to have begun Monday and
ended Thursday in the port of Polyarny, near Murmansk. According to
Interfax, the incident was reported in several local newspapers,
radio and television stations in the region. However, the agency
said, Northern Fleet officials denied it.

FIFA reduces time players must be released for Confederation Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH (AP) _ Soccer's world governing body announced Friday it
would not succumb to pressure to change the dates of the upcoming
Confederation Cup, but would instead reduce the time clubs are
required to put their players at the disposal of the competition.
	   ``Clubs will no longer have to give up their players two weeks
before the Confederation Cup,'' said FIFA President Sepp Blatter.
``Now we're requiring clubs to make their players available 48
hours before the first game of the competition.''
	   The United States, Mexico, Bolivia, Brazil, France, Saudi
Arabia, Egypt and the winner of the current Oceania contest in
Brisbane, Australia, will participate in the eight-nation contest.
	   Scheduled in Mexico next January 8-20 _ when leagues in the
southern hemisphere are in full swing and only some in Europe are
off _ several associations will be left without their stars for
league competition.
	   ``We're willing to be flexible,'' said Blatter. ``Now we ask
clubs to understand other continents are also involved and insisted
it not be scratched from the calendar.''
	   The Confederation Cup draw was also rescheduled to October 4 in
Mexico City.
	   FIFA also announced that the 2002 World Cup, co-hosted by South
Korea and Japan, would remain in the customary period of June and
July, but may shift more towards the start of June.
	   ``Looking at meteorological studies from Japan and South Korea,
we feel it should be scheduled as long as possible in June,'' said
Blatter.
	   While FIFA will decide on the actual dates within June and July
at the executive committee meeting in December, not everyone was
convinced a move to May was still out of the question.
	   ``In principle it will be in June and July,'' said FIFA
Vice-President Mong-Joon Chung, president of the Korean Football
Association.
	   ``But there will be further consultations between FIFA and the
two organizing committees to have further consideration of the
date.
	   ``The final decision will be made in December.''
	   South Korea had requested that the event be advanced to May to
avoid the rainy season.
	   The quadrennial, month-long competition traditionally has
started around June 10, after the professional soccer season in
Europe and South America ends in April.
	   During the two-day executive committee meetings, FIFA also
discussed the dangers of the performance enhancing substance EPO
and the possibility of introducing blood tests _ and no longer only
urine tests _ as well as random doping testing between
competitions.
	   ``The medical commission is going to meet next month to discuss
doping and look at blood testing,'' said Blatter. ``The IOC has
called a forum for October 27 in Lausanne and invited all the
international federations to exchange views. We'll be there.''
	   FIFA also decided to launch a study of the legal and economic
implications of the Bosman-ruling. Blatter will then lead a
``high-level delegation'' to discuss the issue with the European
Union authorities in Brussels.
	   FIFA is also revising a system of licensed players' agents to
give greater aid to players with contractual difficulties.
	   In the revised system more responsibility would be given to
individual national associations to deal directly with cases
involving them and their clubs or players, with FIFA retaining a
supervisory role.
	   Blatter also announced FIFA will hold an extra-ordinary congress
in Los Angeles, Calfornia from July 5-9, 1999, in the first week of
the Women's World Cup, to discuss FIFA budget and statutes.
	   Candidatures to organize the 2006 World Cup will be accepted at
the end of October this year, with bid countries required to
confirm their intentions by April 1999. Bids will be reviewed by
January 31, 2000 and the executive committee will select the host
country in March 2000 _ not in June 2000 as previously planned.
	   FIFA also announced the creation of a new Committee for Football
_ in essence a players' committee _ to be chaired by Spanish
executive committee member Angel Villar. Michel Platini will act as
secretary, with other past and present prominent soccer players
such as Pele, Frans Beckenbauer, Bobby Charlton and George Weah
also getting involved.

 &UR; Two Spanish cyclists expelled from Tour of Spain for failing blood
test &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Jimenez overtaking Olano in overall standings;
Russian Zintchenko wins 20th stage &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PUERTA DE NAVACERRADA, Spain (AP) _ Spaniard Jose Maria Jimenez
overtook fellow countryman and teammate Abraham Olano to move into
the top post in the overall standings in the Tour of Spain's
third-last stage Friday while Fernando Escartin ousted Frenchman
Laurent Jalabert from the runner-up spot.
	   Jimenez pushed out ahead of Olano on the fourth of six grueling
mountain passes in the 206-kilometer (127-mile) stage. Jimenez,
riding for Banesto, had gone into the stage in fourth place, 31
seconds behind Olano. He now has a 38-second advantage over Olano.
	   Escartin, of the Kelme crew, moved up from No. 3 to edge
Jalabert out of No. 2 to lie six seconds behind Jimenez.
	   Jimenez led in the overall standings for the sixth, seventh and
eighth stages before Olano took over. With Sunday's stage a purely
ceremonial round, all final challenges for leadership are expected
to be played out Saturday in the 21st stage, a 39-kilometer
(24-mile) individual time trial in and around the town of
Fuenlabrada, close to Madrid.
	   Friday's stage was won by Russian cyclist Andrei Zintchenko of
the Vitalicio Seguros team.
	   Earlier in the day, Zintchenko's teammates, Juan Carlos
Dominguez and Daniel Clavero, of Spain, were expelled from the tour
after failing a blood test.
	   Both men had an abnormally high number of oxygen-carrying red
blood cells, according to a test administered by the International
Cycling Union prior to the 20th leg of the 22-stage race, the
national news agency Efe said.
	   The cyclists failed the test because their hematocrit level _
the proportion of red blood cells to the total volume of blood _
was measured as above 50 percent, which is considered a health
risk.
	   The ICU describes the blood test as a safety measure rather than
a doping control.
	   There is no reliable way of detecting the use of EPO, a
synthetic hormone that stimulates the production of oxygen-carrying
red blood cells, although a high red blood cell count can indicate
its use.
	   Clavero had been in seventh place in the standings with just
three legs left to go.
	   His coach Javier Minguez said team doctors had tested
Vitalicio's riders on Thursday night and found their hematocrit
level below 50 percent.
	   ``My conscience is clear,'' Minguez said.
	   The expulsion means Clavero and Dominguez will miss next month's
world road championships in Valkenburg, the Netherlands, because
they have to wait 15 days to have their blood tested again to see
if the hematocrit level is safe.
	   Other riders tested Friday included Olano, Jalabert, Escartin
and the race's two-time defending champion Alex Zuelle, of
Switzerland.

Government considering introducing pet passports, instead of
</HEADLINE>
quarantine &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT SEELY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Under pressure from well-heeled Britons who want
to take their pooches traveling, the government is considering
replacing Britain's tough pet quarantine laws with pet
``passports'' and animal microchips.
	   Current rules, imposed in 1901, mean that pet owners moving into
Britain spend an average of 1,500 pounds (dlrs 2,400) to board a
pet in a quarantine kennel for six months as part of strict
anti-rabies laws which have kept Britain rabies-free for most of
this century.
	   Instead of locking up the pets in kennels, which dog and cat
lovers say is cruel, the government wants microchips inserted under
the skin of pets so they can be identified by an electronic scanner
at ports and airports. Each pet would also have a passport-style
document listing vaccinations against diseases.
	   ``In any event, I am determined to make sure that the UK remains
a rabies-free country with strong safeguards against the disease,''
Agriculture Minister Nick Brown said after announcing the plan in a
government discussion paper released Wednesday. He called for
further research into the plan.
	   Even if the plan is implemented, Americans coming to settle or
work on contract in Britain would still have to put their pets into
quarantine.
	   Initially, the government envisages pet passports applying only
to European Union countries, with possible extension to Australia
and New Zealand.
	   Chris Patten, the last governor of Hong Kong, and other
well-known Britons working abroad such as actress Elizabeth Hurley
and artist David Hockney, argue that British law condemns their
pets to months of misery if they bring them home.
	   Animal welfare and veterinary groups are divided over the plan.
	   ``This system would be more effective and more humane than the
current quarantine system,'' said Alex Ross of the Royal Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
	   But the British Veterinary Association said passports would
provide no safeguard.
	   ``If it works the same as our passports, it's going to be pretty
feeble,'' said association spokesman Ted Chandler. ``Just flashing
a document in a long queue of people coming into the country is no
check at all.''
	   The proposals were made by an independent group of experts led
by Ian Kennedy, professor of Health Law, Ethics and Policy at
University College, London.
	   About 10,000 animals go through quarantine in Britain each year.
Only one case of animal-borne rabies has been reported in Britain
in 25 years _ a bat which bit a woman in 1996.

	   RAMAT HASHARON, Israel (AP) _ France moved into a 2-0 lead over
Israel in the Davis Cup World Group qualifying rounds when Cedric
Pioline defeated Amir Hadad 6-2, 6-3, 6-3 and Guillaume Raoux beat
Harel Levy 7-6 (7-1), 6-2, 6-4 on Friday.
	   In the first match, playing before a crowd of 2,000 spectators
at the Ramat Hasharon Tennis Center, Pioline, 29, ranked 18th in
the world, consistently outclassed his inexperienced 20-year-old
opponent, ranked 322th and making his second Davis Cup singles
appearance.
	   Pioline's powerful, varied serve repeatedly frustrated the
Israeli who managed only one service break throughout the match.
	   The Frenchman took the opening set comfortably with two service
breaks and the second with a single service break. He opened the
third set by breaking Hadad's serve yet again but appeared to
suffer a loss of concentration, allowing the Israeli to break his
serve at 3-3.
	   But Pioline's greater class showed as he took the final three
games with a plum. With a great arsenal of shots, Pioline
repeatedly pressured Hadad into errors and had little trouble
passing his opponent near the net.
	   The second match opened with a closely fought opening set in
which each player broke service once. But Raoux, 28, ranked 44th in
the world, raced away in the tie break, forcing the 20-year-old
Levy, ranked 217th, into a series of errors.
	   The tie break set the pattern for the second set which Raoux
took with two early service breaks. The match was between two
baseline players in which Raoux repeatedly lured his opponent to
the net where Levi made mistakes. The Israeli recovered his
composure in the third set which went to service until the ninth
game, when Raoux broke to 5-4.
	   ``It was a good start for us,'' said the French coach, Yannik
Noah. ``They (the French players) played good tennis today and were
there for the key points.''
	   Noah said that the tentative line-up for Saturday's doubles
match pits France's Nicolas Escude and Jerome Golmard against
Israel's Noam Behr and Eyal Erlich.

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Human rights groups and the
opposition warned of possible vote fraud by the government Friday
as Slovaks began a two-day election that may oust the Central
European nation's authoritarian leadership.
	   Parliamentary balloting proceeded uneventfully, with voters
lined up outside polling stations from the Danube to the High Tatra
Mountains even before they opened Friday afternoon. The first-day
turnout was reported to be strong.
	   But tension lingered over what might happen next after weeks of
alarmist speculation and accusations that the government of Prime
Minister Vladimir Meciar, assailed abroad for anti-democratic
practices, would meddle with the vote or call it off in order to
retain power.
	   Opposition leaders, who said many voters would wait until
Saturday due to fears of vote-count fraud, voiced confidence that
anti-Meciar forces would easily claim enough combined seats in
parliament to be able to lead a new government if the vote is free
and fair.
	   ``We are surely going to win,'' said Milan Knazko, a leader of
the Slovak Democratic Coalition, the largest opposition party.
	   ``There needs to be a reform of this autocratic government,'' he
said after voting in the capital, Bratislava.
	   International human rights groups and foreign diplomats also
were wary of the potential for election manipulation by the
government, which last year canceled a key ballot question on the
eve of a referendum that could have weakened its grip on power.
	   A media watchdog group, the London-based International Center
Against Censorship, claimed the elections already can be called
unfair because of the ``incredibly biased media environment.'' It
criticized the government for flouting domestic and international
law to ensure that media coverage was dominated by the ruling
party.
	   Meciar, 56, and his nationalist Movement for a Democratic
Slovakia, won the last elections in 1992 and 1994. Except for a
short period in opposition, they have ruled Slovakia during the six
years since it broke away from former Czechoslovakia and became
independent in 1993.
	   They retain a loyal following among rural residents,
nationalistic voters and those in industry and banking who depend
on the government. The last pre-election opinion poll, two weeks
ago, indicated they had more support than any single party, with 28
percent.
	   ``I trust him,'' said Ludmila Mariaova, 74, outside a downtown
Bratislava polling station. ``Nobody else appreciates those of us
who have put in 40 years of hard work.''
	   But the five-party opposition coalition has been running just
behind, followed by three other anti-Meciar parties that promise to
unite in a new government. Combined, the four are expected to win a
majority of the 150 seats in parliament.
	   Limiting Meciar's prospects are the fact that only one party
that is likely to win seats _ the far-right Slovak National Party,
his main coalition partner in the current government _ says it
would unite with him.
	   ``Meciar has no chance to put together a majority coalition,''
Grigorij Meseznikov, an analyst for the Institute for Public
Affairs, an independent Bratislava think tank, said Friday. ``His
only chance would be to form a minority coalition if his party does
well enough.''
	   Meciar said recently, however, that he would not try to put
together a minority government. He also has declared that elections
will be fair, and dismissed opponents' claims to the contrary as
propaganda aimed at stirring up voters.
	   More than 200 international monitors are in Slovakia to observe
the balloting.
	   Western officials will be closely watching the results in the
nation of 5.5 million, saying its chances of being admitted to NATO
or the European Union any time soon will depend on a change in
governments.

United opposition draws up new election law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Croatia's six main opposition parties
presented a draft election law Friday that would eliminate a
special provision setting aside 12 seats in the upper house of
parliament for Croats living abroad.
	   The proposal also calls for unbiased television coverage of
elections.
	   The opposition's move would appease the United States and other
Western governments, which have recently stepped up pressure on
Croatia to amend the electoral law. They say the law favors the
ruling party.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright reiterated that
concern when she met President Franjo Tudjman in Zagreb earlier
this month.
	   Although international officials have not publicly defined their
complaints, analysts believe the most controversial part of the
existing election law entitles the 4 million Croats living abroad
to have their own representatives for 12 seats in the 127-seat
Chamber of Deputies.
	   That provision allowed Vladimir Soljic, the former Bosnian Croat
defense minister and vice president of the Muslim-Croat federation,
to become a member of Croatia's parliament, even though he lives in
Bosnia.
	   The proposed law would still allow Croats living abroad to run
for office, but would not set aside seats specifically for them.
	   Deputies who live outside Croatia either come to the country to
attend parliamentary sessions, or send a proxy.
	   The Croatian Diaspora has traditionally been sympathetic toward
Tudjman's ruling Croatian Democratic Union, or HDZ, crediting them
with Croatia's independence from Yugoslavia. The support of
Croatians living abroad typically gives the HDZ 10 percent more
seats than they otherwise would have.
	   The opposition parties, which are rarely united, also want to
see Croatian TV and other state-run media provide impartial
election coverage.
	   During 1997 elections, U.S. observers judged them as ``free but
not fair,'' and complained mostly about TV's biased approach.
	   The opposition wants the measures placed on parliament's agenda
as quickly as possible. But Tudjman's party, which holds 74 seats
in the Chamber of Deputies, may refuse to do so.
	   Elections are due in late 1999, but rumors are widespread that
early elections may be called because HDZ's popularity is steadily
declining.

Report: Man arrested for passing classified information
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A man in northern Russia has been arrested for
trying to pass classified information, apparently related to rocket
production, to a foreign company, a news agency reported Friday.
	   Interfax said the man was arrested by the Federal Security
Service, the main successor agency to the Soviet KGB, while he was
handing over the information in Udmurtia, a region about 600
kilometers (375 miles) east of Moscow.
	   The report said no further details of the case had been
disclosed except that the classified information came from a
facility that is related to rocket production.

Henman wins in four sets to give Britain 2-0 lead

 &UR; Eds: Updates with second singles rubber.

<TEXT>
	   NOTTINGHAM, England (AP) _ Tim Henman dropped a set Friday on
the way to beating Mahesh Bhupathi to give Britain a 2-0 lead over
India in a Davis Cup World Group qualifying round tie.
	   The British No. 1 lost the first set but fought back to win 4-6,
6-3, 6-3, 6-3 against the World No. 363.
	   Henman was expected to outclass Bhupathi but continually
struggled against the 24-year-old Indian's double-handed backhand
returns as the pair swapped service breaks in the opening two sets.
	   In the ealier singles rubber, Greg Rusedski saved a match point
in the fifth set and survived a marathon against Leander Paes to
give Britain a 1-0 lead.
	   Rusedski repeatedly battled from behind in the final set to
prevail 2-6, 6-3, 3-6, 6-2, 11-9 in three hours, 16 minutes.
	   Paes twice served for the match at 5-4 and 6-5. But Rusedski
broke back each time, saving a match point in the 12th game with a
backhand service return which clipped the netcord and dropped at
the Indian's feet.
	   Rusedski got in trouble again on his own serve, going down 0-40
at 6-6 and 15-40 at 7-7. But he again fought back to hold.
	   Rusedski led 10-9 when he broke Paes to close out the match. At
15-40, Paes saved the first match point with a forehand passing
shot. But he double faulted on the second to end the match.
	   Paes and Bhupathi, the world's third-ranked doubles team, face
Henman and Rusedski in Saturday's doubles. The reverse singles are
Sunday.
	   The winner of the tie will advance to the elite 16-team World
Group. Britain hasn't played in the World Group since 1992.

Communist-era business leader Ede Horvath dies at age 74
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Ede Horvath, the former head of one of
Hungary's biggest enterprises during the communist era, died at age
74, the state news agency MTI reported Friday.
	   Horvath was a representative figure in the small club of top
communist business leaders, popularly called ``Red Barons,'' who
were given some leeway to make independent decision on the basis of
their political reliability.
	   Horvath, who was born in Szombathely, a town on the
Hungarian-Austrian border, was an iron worker and communist party
member in his youth.
	   He rose to head the company Raba from 1963 to 1989, where he had
been employed as an iron turner, and gained a position on the
Central Committee of the communist party, a post he held 1970-89.
He retired just as communism was crumbling.
	   Raba was a major truck manufacturer, supplying the COMECON
countries. Since the collapse of communism it has been privatized
and has gone public, and is successfully selling truck axles to the
U.S. market.

Rushdie emerges from life in shadows
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By AUDREY WOODS &QC;

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ No longer threatened with death by the Iranian
government, Salman Rushdie said Friday he has no regrets and no
apologies for writing ``The Satanic Verses,'' the book that drew
the wrath of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
	   ``I've had 10 years of my life deformed by this,'' he said.
``I've had friends of mine threatened, had my family messed about,
had people that I care about shot and killed. I could ask for an
apology, but I'm not doing so.''
	   ``The world has just changed,'' he added at a news conference.
``Let's get on with our lives.''
	   The 51-year-old writer spoke eloquently and with obvious relief
at Iran's announcement Thursday that it would distance itself from
a dlrs 2.5 million reward for his death.
	   Since the late Iranian leader announced his ``fatwa'' Feb. 14,
1989, claiming ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemed Islam, Rushdie has
spent nearly a decade in hiding, under police protection.
	   His ordeal in the shadows began with ``shock and grief'' over
the initial news reports.
	   ``It's an extraordinary thing to see people walking down the
streets of a foreign city carrying your picture with the eyes poked
out and calling for your death,'' he said. ``Everything you think
about everything, suddenly ceases to be true.''
	   He said there have been repeated threats against his life but
``Nobody got very close.''
	   In 1991, a Japanese translator of the book was stabbed to death
and the Italian translator survived a knife attack. In 1993, the
book's Norwegian publisher was shot three times and survived.
	   At least 45 people were killed in early riots about the book.
	   Thanking his supporters, he said the battle against the death
sentence was not just for his life, ``but because it represented
many of the things in this world we most cared about.''
	   ``The freedom of the imagination, the great overarching issue of
freedom of speech, the right of human beings to walk down the
streets of their own country without fear. These have been colossal
matters,'' he said.
	   Rushdie, who has a grown son from his first marriage, had been
married to writer Marianne Wiggins when the fatwa was announced.
Six months later they separated, divorcing in 1993. When he
remarried in 1997, his bride was identified only as ``Elizabeth''
to protect her safety. They have since had a son.
	   The writer confessed Friday that a low point in an extraordinary
decade was when he falsely claimed publicly to have ``embraced
Islam.''
	   ``I am not a religious person and I shouldn't have said I was,''
said Rushdie, who was born in India and raised in a Muslim family.
	   ``The Satanic Verses'' has sold more than 1 million copies in
English, has been translated into 15 languages and banned in more
than 20 countries.
	   Asked Friday how he would react to continued requests that it be
withdrawn from sale, he replied, ``There is not a chance in hell of
the book being withdrawn ... `The Satanic Verses' is as important
in my body of work as any of my other books.''
	   He expressed sorrow for the people killed in demonstrations
against the book, particularly in India. '' ... I feel in many
cases they did not even know what they were demonstrating
against.''
	   Now he intends to write about his ordeal.
	   ``It's a very hot story and most of you don't know it. I look
forward to telling it,'' he said. ``I always felt the time to write

Soldier gives up after deserting

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout to CORRECT that serviceman who gave up was not
man accused of killing comrades. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian serviceman gave himself up Friday, hours
after he deserted his post near St. Petersburg in the latest sign
of trouble in Russia's military, news agencies reported.
	   Another soldier apparently remained on the loose, five days
after he allegedly killed two comrades and wounded a third near the
country's main nuclear weapons arsenal.
	   Also Friday, the Interfax news agency reported that 26 sailors
in Russia's Northern Fleet had confined themselves in a ward room
aboard their ship for four days, in a protest against what they
called ``unbearable service conditions.''
	   Russia's military has been plagued by increasing acts of protest
and violence as members of the beleaguered service chafe _ and
sometimes snap _ under miserable conditions that include late pay,
scant food and brutal hazing.
	   The serviceman who gave up Friday had been on the loose since 4
a.m., when he deserted his unit in the village of Lembolovo near
St. Petersburg. He reportedly fled with an automatic weapon and 60
cartridges.
	   He reportedly surrendered early in the afternoon after calling a
local hotline, according to ITAR-Tass and Interfax.
	   The other AWOL serviceman has been on the loose since Monday,
when he shot the three colleagues in the Ural Mountains city of
Ozyorsk, home to Russia's main nuclear arsenal.
	   The Northern Fleet protest was reported to have begun Monday and
ended Thursday in the port of Polyarny, near Murmansk. According to
Interfax, the incident was reported in several local newspapers,
radio and television stations in the region. However, the agency
said, Northern Fleet officials denied it.

	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ The United States airlifted former
warlord and now fugitive Roosevelt Johnson out of Liberia on Friday
to end a week-old standoff that began when he sought refuge inside
the American Embassy.
	   A first helicopter swooped down on a small landing pad at the
back of the sprawling embassy compound, picked up Johnson and
ferried him away amid heavily armed protection. A second helicopter
arrived shortly after the first to pick up several other people.
	   Although it was not immediately clear where Johnson was headed,
U.S. officials said the helicopters _ both civilian _ had come in
from Freetown, the capital of neighboring Sierra Leone.
	   The move to evacuate Johnson from Liberia came after days of
talks between U.S. officials in Washington and President Charles
Taylor's government.
	   Taylor has urged the United States to hand Johnson over to the
government, but the president's spokesman on Thursday said there
would be no effort to block Johnson's evacuation.
	   Johnson, Taylor's main rival, had been holed up in the embassy
in the capital, Monrovia, for a week. Liberian soldiers apparently
fired on his group as they were trying to arrange for refuge at the
sprawling seaside compound.
	   Fearing another round of fighting, security had been greatly
increased at the embassy and most diplomats have been evacuated.
U.S. military reinforcements were sent in to help shore up the
embassy's defenses.
	   At least three of Johnson's supporters were killed in the
shooting and two Americans were injured.
	   Taylor and Johnson have long been rivals, heading opposing
factions during Liberia's seven-year civil war.

Israel soothes ruffled Swiss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu issued a conciliatory statement Friday, ending a flap
over a letter he wrote praising an outspoken Jewish critic of Swiss
banks.
	   Swiss officials said the statement meant that Swiss armaments
chief Toni Wicki would be able to go ahead with plans to visit
Israel starting Sunday and that Netanyahu will be welcome in Bern
in November.
	   ``The friendship between Israel and Switzerland is solid,''
Netanyahu said in the statement released by the Israeli Embassy.
``Both states have mutually done their utmost to cross a turbulent
period with creativity and wisdom.''
	   The bruised Swiss feelings resulted from the leak last week of a
thank-you note Netanyahu sent to Edgar Bronfman, head of the World
Jewish Congress, for his efforts on behalf of Holocaust victims.
	   The Swiss government let it be known it was reconsidering
sending Wicki, who might be making arms purchases, and might even
scrub a high-level Swiss-Israeli economic seminar that Netanyahu
was to cochair in November.
	   Netanyahu's Aug. 28 letter thanked Bronfman for his efforts ``to
redress a terrible injustice inflicted on the Jewish people.''
	   ``You have provided moral leadership in a long and tough
struggle against those who profited from the unspeakable suffering
of millions of Jews. You have done this with great pride, dignity,
skill and aplomb,'' said Netanyahu.
	   Following a campaign led by Bronfman and the World Jewish
Restitution Organization, Swiss banks agreed in August to pay dlrs
1.25 billion to Holocaust survivors to compensate for World War II
losses.
	   But the Swiss government remains angry with Bronfman for what it
considers were unfair attacks and in particular for his remarks
earlier this year about ``total war'' on the Swiss.
	   During a visit by Swiss president Flavio Cotti to Israel in May,
Netanyahu criticized such bellicose statements. And in a veiled
reference to Bronfman, he said that Israel was ``not at war with
Switzerland.''
	   Cotti and other government leaders were irritated that the
Israeli prime minister should now be praising Bronfman's methods.
	   ``My government welcomes and supports the historic settlement
reached between the Swiss banks, the plaintiffs and the WJRO,''
said the Netanyahu statement Friday.
	   ``I am confident that this settlement will lead to a much-needed
time of healing,'' it said.
	   Neutral Switzerland, surrounded during World War II by the Nazis
and their allies, stayed out of the war. It was subsequently
accused by Jewish groups of profiting from the Holocaust, retaining
the assets of Jews slain by the Germans and acting as banker to the
Nazis.

Interior Ministry to take preventive measures for Oct. 7 protest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Beginning Wednesday, Russia's police forces will
be beefed up in anticipation of protests scheduled across the
nation during the first week of October, the Interior Ministry
announced Friday.
	   In Moscow alone, 11,000 policemen and up to 6,000 Interior
Ministry troops will be deployed to keep order during an
anti-government protest scheduled for Oct. 7, Deputy Interior
Minister Pyotr Latyshev told reporters, according to the ITAR-Tass
news agency.
	   Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin said that the nation's
economic crisis had led to a build-up of political tension, and
that his ministry would take preventive measures ``to cool down
some extremist minds,'' ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Stepashin said that police would not permit railroads and
highways to be blocked, as miners and their allies had succeeded in
doing earlier this year. He said that the ministry ``should foresee
and be ready for any turn events might take, and take necessary
measures to prevent unwanted developments.''
	   Trade unions have organized the Oct. 7 protest, along with
Communists and their hard-line allies. Labor groups have held an
annual protest day in October in recent years.

government, but the president's spokesman on Thursday said there
would be no effort to block Johnson's evacuation.
	   Johnson, Taylor's main rival, had been holed up in the embassy
in the capital, Monrovia, for a week. Liberian soldiers apparently
fired on his group as they were trying to arrange for refuge at the
sprawling seaside compound.
	   Fearing another round of fighting, security had been greatly
increased at the embassy and most diplomats have been evacuated.
U.S. military reinforcements were sent in to help shore up the
embassy's defenses.
	   At least three of Johnson's supporters were killed in the
shooting and two Americans were injured.
	   Taylor and Johnson have long been rivals, heading opposing
factions during Liberia's seven-year civil war.

Human rights groups urge Belgium to act following expulsion death
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Belgium should end the ``inhuman treatment'' that
apparently led to the death of a Nigerian woman while police were
trying to deport her, a coalition of human rights groups said
Friday.
	   The World Organization Against Torture said the Belgian police
practice of subduing deportees by putting pillows over their faces
should be abolished.
	   Semira Adamu lapsed into a coma and died after resisting police
efforts to get her on a Togo-bound plane. Officers tried to subdue
her by smothering her with a pillow.
	   The incident triggered the resignation late Thursday of Belgian
Interior Minister Louis Tobback. Tobback, a Socialist, said the
police force made errors in preparing the deportation of
20-year-old Adamu.
	   Police spokeswoman Els Cleemput said Thursday that police had
used pillows to subdue deportees twice last year. But Cleemput said
resistance from deportees had increased this year and police
resorted to the practice a dozen times, without incident.
	   A statement from the anti-torture group said Adamu suffocated
``as a result of the inhuman treatment inflicted upon her by the
Belgian police.''
	   The statement said the use of pillows to subdue deportees is
degrading treatment and contravenes the U.N. Convention against
Torture.
	   The Belgian authorities should order a thorough and impartial
investigation of the incident to identify and bring to trial those
responsible, it said.
	   The organization ``requests Belgium to immediately adopt the
appropriate measures to abolish practices such as the one committed
against Ms. Adamu,'' said the statement.

Meciar's authoritarian power on line as Slovaks vote

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Human rights groups and the
opposition warned Friday of possible vote fraud by the government
as Slovaks began a two-day election that may oust the Central
European nation's authoritarian leadership.
	   Parliamentary balloting proceeded uneventfully, with voters
lined up outside polling stations from the Danube to the High Tatra
Mountains even before they opened Friday afternoon. The first-day
turnout was reported to be strong.
	   But tension lingered over what might happen next after weeks of
alarmist speculation and accusations that the government of Prime
Minister Vladimir Meciar, assailed abroad for anti-democratic
practices, would meddle with the vote or call it off in order to
retain power.
	   Opposition leaders, who said many voters would wait until
Saturday due to fears of vote-count fraud, voiced confidence that
anti-Meciar forces would easily claim enough combined seats in
parliament to be able to lead a new government if the vote is free
and fair.
	   ``We are surely going to win,'' said Milan Knazko, a leader of
the Slovak Democratic Coalition, the largest opposition party.
	   ``There needs to be a reform of this autocratic government,'' he
said after voting in the capital, Bratislava.
	   International human rights groups and foreign diplomats also
were wary of the potential for manipulation of the elections by the
government, which last year canceled a key ballot question on the
eve of a referendum that could have weakened its grip on power.
	   A media watchdog group, the London-based International Center
Against Censorship, claimed the elections already can be called
unfair because of the ``incredibly biased media environment.'' It
criticized the government for flouting domestic and international
law to ensure that media coverage was dominated by the ruling
party.
	   Meciar, 56, and his nationalist Movement for a Democratic
Slovakia, won the last elections in 1992 and 1994. Except for a
short period in opposition, they have ruled Slovakia during the six
years since it broke away from former Czechoslovakia and became
independent in 1993.
	   They retain a loyal following among rural residents,
nationalistic voters and those in industry and banking who depend
on the government. The last pre-election opinion poll, two weeks
ago, indicated they had more support than any single party, with 28
percent.
	   ``I trust him,'' said Ludmila Mariaova, 74, outside a downtown
Bratislava polling station. ``Nobody else appreciates those of us
who have put in 40 years of hard work.''
	   But the five-party opposition coalition has been running just
behind, followed by three other anti-Meciar parties that promise to
unite in a new government. Combined, the four are expected to win a
majority of the 150 seats in parliament.
	   Limiting Meciar's prospects are the fact that only one party
that is likely to win seats _ the far-right Slovak National Party,
his main coalition partner in the current government _ says it
would unite with him.
	   ``Meciar has no chance to put together a majority coalition,''
Grigorij Meseznikov, an analyst for the Institute for Public
Affairs, an independent Bratislava think tank, said Friday. ``His
only chance would be to form a minority coalition if his party does
well enough.''
	   Meciar said recently, however, that he would not try to put
together a minority government. He also has declared that elections
will be fair, and dismissed opponents' claims to the contrary as
propaganda aimed at stirring up voters.
	   More than 200 international monitors are in Slovakia to observe
the balloting.
	   Western officials will be closely watching the results in the
nation of 5.5 million, saying its chances of being admitted to NATO
or the European Union any time soon will depend on a change in
government.

band &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Central Bank's order to banks to provide
information about exporters' dollar accounts, details in grafs
10-12. &QL; 
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian government officials indicated
Friday that the government-set trading band for the national
currency might be widened or abandoned altogether.
	   ``It's a possibility,'' Deputy Prime Minister Serhiy Tyhypko
said, commenting on a possible change in the corridor's limits, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   Ukraine's hryvna currency, hit by Russia's financial turmoil,
was trading at 3.33 to the U.S. dollar on Thursday.
	   The rate was close to the upper limit of the currency trading
corridor of 2.5 to 3.5 to the dollar introduced at the beginning of
September. However, the hryvna's black-market rate was already well
below 4 to the dollar Friday.
	   The trading corridor for the hryvna was announced after the
currency left the range of 1.8 to 2.25 to the dollar, which the
government had originally set as the hryvna's trading band for the
whole of 1988.
	   The former Soviet republic's currency had been falling slowly
since the start of Russia's crisis in mid-August, but sharply
increased its plunge over the past two weeks.
	   The hryvna's downfall quickened after the Central Bank had to
stop spending its reserves on defending the currency so as to
qualify for disbursement of further installments of a large
International Monetary Fund loan that was approved in September.
	   In another sign that the hryvna might fall even further, Finance
Minister Ihor Mitiukov told Interfax on Friday that the government
should refrain from announcing a new trading band, but let the rate
float. He did not elaborate.
	   The Central Bank maintained the hryvna at about 2.1 to the
dollar until mid-August, massively spending its reserves in
response to the exodus of foreign investors from Ukraine's
financial market.
	   But the turmoil in Russia caused panic demand for dollars among
banks and the population. The Central Bank was unable to stabilize
the hryvna despite imposing severe controls on the currency market,
which included restrictions on dollar purchases at the currency
exchange and a ban on banks trading dollars among themselves.
	   The latest administrative measure came on Friday after the
Central Bank ordered commercial banks to provide detailed
information about hard-currency accounts opened by the country's 53
large exporters.
	   The order did not contain any further explanation, but bankers
were speculating that the Central Bank might be planning to force
exporters to convert their dollars into hryvna by charging them
with violating the rules governing dollar transactions.

 &UR; Two Spaniards expelled from for failing blood test &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Jimenez overtaking Olano in overall standings;
Russian Zintchenko wins 20th stage &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PUERTA DE NAVACERRADA, Spain (AP) _ Spaniard Jose Maria Jimenez
overtook countryman and teammate Abraham Olano to move into the
overall lead in the Vuelta a Espana Friday, finishing third in the
20th stage to take a six-second lead with two stages remaining.
	   Jimenez, who started the day in third, passed Olano on the
fourth of six grueling mountain passes in the 206-kilometer
(127-mile) stage. He crossed the finish with Russia's Zintchenko
and fellow Spaniard Robert Heras, leading a group of six that
completed the stage in 5 hours, 33 mintues, 33 seconds.
	   Fernando Escartin, who started the day in fourth, crossed just
behind Jimenez with the same time and moved into second overall,
six seconds behind Jimenez.
	   Olano crossed the line in seventh, 1 minute, 9 seconds behind
the lead group and was left in third overall, 38 seconds behind
Jimenez.
	   Jimenez led after the sixth, seventh and eighth stages before
Olano took over the leader's jersey. With Sunday's stage virtually
a ceremonial ride, all final challenges for the lead are expected
Saturday, a 39-kilometer (24-mile) individual time trial in and
around the town of Fuenlabrada close to Madrid.
	   Earlier in the day, Zintchenko's Vitalicio Seguros teammates,
Juan Carlos Dominguez and Daniel Clavero, of Spain, were expelled
from the Vuelta for failing a blood test.
	   Both men had an abnormally high red blood cell cout, according
to a test administered by the International Cycling Union prior
day's stage, the national news agency Efe said.
	   The cyclists failed the test because their hematocrit level _
the proportion of red blood cells to the total volume of blood _
was measured above 50 percent, which is considered a health risk.
	   The ICU describes the blood test as a safety measure rather than
a doping control.
	   But the high red-blood cell count is an indication of possible
use of EPO, a synthetic hormone that stimulates the production of
red blood cells but for which there is no reliable test.
	   Clavero was in seventh place in the overall standings with just
three legs left to go.
	   His coach Javier Minguez said team doctors had tested
Vitalicio's riders on Thursday night and found their hematocrit
level below 50 percent. ``My conscience is clear,'' Minguez said.
	   The expulsion means Clavero and Dominguez will miss next month's
road World Championships in Valkenburg, Netherlands, because they
have to wait 15 days to have their blood tested again to see if the
hematocrit level is safe.
	   Other riders tested Friday included Olano, Frenchman Laurent
Jalabert, and Escartin.
	   Also tested was two-time defending champion Alex Zuelle, a Swiss
rider with Festina.

Scots nationalist leader says that independence good for relations
</HEADLINE>
with England

<TEXT>
	   INVERNESS, Scotland (AP) _ Scots nationalist leader Alex Salmond
said Friday that independence for his country offered the best
prospect of maintaining good relations with England.
	   ``One of the very best things about the road to independence is
the opportunity it offers for a grown-up relationship with our
neighbors in England,'' Salmond said in his keynote address to the
party's annual conference in this town in northern Scotland.
	   ``When it rains in Scotland, some people blame the English,''
Salmond told his audience of 1,000 supporters. ``Self-government is
about self-responsibility and self-respect and out of the process
will come a new and better relationship with our friends south of
the border.''
	   In opinion polls, Salmond's Scottish National Party is at record
levels of popularity, boosted by rapid disenchantment north of the
border with Britain's new Labor Party government, and by a sense of
increasing confidence _ critics call it foolhardiness _ that
Scotland can go it alone as an independent state.
	   After attracting 22 percent of the Scottish vote in Britain's
1997 national elections, the Scottish National Party has been
running level with, or ahead of, Labor in polls, each with around
40 percent support.
	   In September 1997, 74 percent of Scots voted to create a new
parliament based in Edinburgh. In May, voters will elect the
129-member assembly, the first in Scotland since union with England
in 1707. If the Scottish National Party wins the most seats, it has
promised to seek a referendum on full independence within four
years.
	   Salmond said that his party will chart a two-track policy of
campaigning for independence, while at the same time working to
make the new Scottish assembly a success.
	   ``The key to success next year lies both in our positive
approach to what we can do in our new parliament and articulating
how much more we could do with independence,'' Salmond said.

Top officials quit over appointment of new finance minister

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's top economic official quit his job in
anger Friday, and the new government got some bad news from the
International Monetary Fund: no new loan installments this month.
	   Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime minister in charge of
economic policy, quit after President Boris Yeltsin announced the
appointment of a holdover finance minister who served in the
previous two administrations.
	   Shokhin said the minister, Mikhail Zadornov, might know finance,
but ``his professionalism has not been confirmed in the past
month,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov lashed out at Shokhin for his
``whimsical demarche,'' and said he was acting irresponsibly during
a time of crisis.
	   Another top financial official, Dmitry Vasilyev, head of the
market watchdog Federal Securities Commission, also resigned in
protest against Zadornov's appointment.
	   Zadornov, a 35-year-old economist, is considered one of the only
members of the new Cabinet who is fully committed to
market-oriented economic reforms.
	   However, he carries the baggage of the economic team that
presided over Russia's decision to devalue the ruble and
effectively default on its loans last month.
	   Shokhin said he doesn't intend to remain as a ``fig leaf'' for
international investors when the Russian government is ``occupied
by people who have already deceived investors once.''
	   The difficulty of Russia's position was highlighted earlier in
the day when a team from the International Monetary Fund left
Moscow without recommending the next installment of a dlrs 22.6
billion loan package.
	   The IMF said the team would return on Oct. 12 for additional
negotiations _ a postponement that was disappointing to Russian
officials, if not entirely unexpected.
	   The IMF has stressed in recent weeks that it expects to see
signs of an enduring commitment to market-oriented economic reforms
before it agrees to release any more of the money it promised
Russia in July. So far, Primakov and his team have been slow to
embrace the kinds of reforms the IMF is seeking.
	   After it released the first loan installment in July, the IMF
said future installments would depend on Russia's commitment to
improving tax collection and cutting social welfare costs.
	   The Russian Tax Service announced Friday that tax collection
continued to plummet in September after disappointing August
collections of 12 billion rubles (dlrs 755 million), 2 billion
rubles (dlrs 125 million) below expectations.
	   Primakov has said repeatedly that he intends to balance social
welfare needs with purely economic ones.
	   The government effectively acknowledged Friday that it had
released 3 billion rubles (dlrs 188 million) into the economy last
week in the sort of inflationary move abhorred by Western
economists.
	   The Central Bank said the country's overall money supply totaled
170.3 billion (dlrs 10.7 billion) Monday, up from 167.3 billion
rubles (dlrs 10.6 billion) one week earlier.
	   The new government continued to take shape, with Yeltsin
announcing 10 Cabinet-level appointments, including that of
Zadornov. Yeltsin has now appointed 20 Cabinet members, leaving 10
positions to be filled.
	   Yeltsin dismissed the previous government headed by Sergei
Kiriyenko as the economy began to unravel last month, saying the
country needed a more experienced leader to shepherd it through the
crisis.
	   Primakov seems committed to a middle course between the sort of
radical reform efforts that many in the West have been urging and
the Soviet-style retrenchment that Yeltsin's leftist opposition
might prefer.
	   In other developments Friday:
	   _ A plan to pay out money to Russians from their frozen bank
accounts won't begin until Nov. 30, two weeks later than previously
planned, news reports said.
	   _ Primakov said his government would try to clean up the
criminal activity that is pervasive in the country's unregulated
``shadow economy.''
	   _ ITAR-Tass reported that Russia's foreign trade for the first
six months of this year was down 5 percent from the same period
last year _ with exports dropping 13 percent while imports actually
rose 8.6 percent. Imports have all but ceased since the economic
crisis began.
	   _ Russian stocks ended lower in almost non-existent trading,
with volume totaling just dlrs 163,350.

Andreas Moeller to rejoin German national team
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Midfielder Andreas Moeller said Friday he will
rejoin the German national soccer team, making the new side look a
lot like the old one that disappointed at the World Cup.
	   Moeller, with 89 caps, joins aging 37-year-old libero Lothar
Matthaeus as two players coming back under new coach Erich Ribbeck
after quitting following Germany's dismal World Cup.
	   Ribbeck feels he lacks the luxury of rebuilding the side with a
key European championship qualification match against Turkey
looming Oct. 24.
	   ``It's clear to me I don't have any grace period,'' Ribbeck
said.
	   Paris St. Germain defender Christian Woerms also will stay on
the squad after apologizing for calling Ribbeck ``the worst coach I
ever had'' while both were at Bayer Leverkusen.
	   After three-time champion Germany was ousted 3-0 by Croatia in
the World Cup quarterfinals, both the media and public had screamed
that the aging squad needed to be rebuilt with younger players.
	   Moeller, 31, told ZDF television he will be back in the national
tricot for the Turkey match. The Borussia Dortmund player is needed
to fill the playmaker role vacated by Stefan Effenberg, who quit
unexpectedly last week.
	   Moeller, Germany's all-time leading scorer as a midfielder, quit
the squad in anger after former coach Berti Vogts benched him early
at the World Cup.
	   ``I think Ribbeck will handle me fairly,'' Moeller said.
	   Ribbeck, in the short term at least, plans to build on the
tested leadership qualities of Matthaeus, the veteran of five World
Cups with 129 caps.
	   ``Lothar (Matthaeus) is exactly the type of player I need now
since we first have to qualify ourselves for the World Cup,''
Ribbeck said.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks were bouncing back from steep early
losses on Wall Street and recovered some lost ground in Europe
Friday, but traders remained skittish about the growing damage from
economic crises in Asia and Russia.
	   Investors worldwide were unnerved this week by the dlrs 3.5
billion private bailout of a major hedge fund. Adding to the
anxiety was the disclosure from United Bank of Switzerland that
market turmoil, including investments in the hedge fund, had left
it with huge losses this quarter. There are worries about where the
next flashpoint would emerge.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, which fell 152.42 on Thursday,
dropped an additional 112 points in the early going, but was up
31.92 at 8,033.91 by early afternoon in trading that was slower
than Thursday's pace.
	   Broader market indicators also were bouncing back from an early
setback.
	   The early selling had threatened to wipe out the 257.21-point
surge by the Dow on Wednesday, when Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan signaled interest rate cuts are likely.
	   In Asia, the key market indicator dropped 3.4 percent in Tokyo,
where traders also are upset by a political dispute over
legislation to rescue Japan's ailing financial system. Shares also
fell 1.7 percent in Hong Kong.
	   In London, Europe's biggest stock market, the main index
recovered some of its losses by the close, finishing down 2.1
percent. Major indexes were down 2.1 percent in Paris and 1.8
percent in Frankfurt, Germany, both closing above their lows for
the day.

	   NADOR, Morocco (AP) _ Thirty-eight people were killed Friday
when a Spanish airliner crashed into a northern Moroccan hillside
and smashed into pieces.
	   After some 10 hours of searches by rescue team from both
countries, all 38 bodies were recovered, said Spanish police chief
Juan Cotino, who flew to the scene.
	   The plane was carrying 34 passengers and four crew members from
the southern Spanish port city of Malaga to Melilla, a tiny Spanish
enclave on Morocco's Mediterranean coast.
	   The plane went down in a rugged mountain area less than half a
kilometer in from the coast and just five kilometers (two miles)
north of Melilla as it approached for landing shortly before 9 a.m.
(0700 gmt).
	   The cause of the accident was not known, although visibility at
the airport was said to be poor.
	   ``It appears the plane crashed into a hilltop and broke into
pieces,'' said Melilla's regional government chief, Enrique
Palacios, who is also the city's mayor.
	   Police chief Cotino said many of the bodies were badly
dismembered and burned, hampering identification.
	   Two of the passengers were Moroccan while the rest were Spanish,
rescue workers said.
	   The 86-seat, British-built BAE 146 belonged to the Spanish
charter airline Pauknair, which specializes in flights between
Melilla and cities in Spain proper. The airline runs 55 of the
30-minute flights between Melilla and Malaga each week.
	   In a statement, Pauknair said the company was deeply affected by
the crash and wished to express its condolences to the bereaved
families.
	   The wreckage of the plane was spotted by a Spanish air force
plane carrying out maneuvers on Friday.
	   It was the first serious air crash involving a Spanish airline
in more than 13 years. A Madrid-bound Boeing 727 of the state
carrier Iberia hit a television antenna on top of a hill in the
northern city of Bilbao, killing 148 people.
	   The world's deadliest aviation disaster occurred on March 27,
1977 in Spain's Canary Islands. A KLM jetliner crashed into a Pan
American jumbo jet on the runway of Tenerife airport, killing 585
people.

Financial experts hold crucial economic bailout talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AMIR ZIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Cash-strapped Pakistan will hold
another round of talks with global donor agencies in October in
Washington in a bid to get a bailout package for its battered
economy jolted by international sanctions and a dlrs 32 billion
external debt, a senior official said Friday.
	   ``Our discussions will resume in Washington from Oct. 2,''
Hafeez Pasha, finance adviser to prime minister told a news
briefing.
	   Pakistan is hoping for the bail out package, particularly after
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif promised to sign a global nuclear test
ban treaty while in New York this week.
	   A joint team of the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank has been holding talks in Pakistan for the past two weeks with
Pakistan's financial managers which were aimed to decide a relief
package for the country's ailing economy.
	   But the talks remained inconclusive and ended with hopes of a
breakthrough in next round.
	   Pakistan is scrambling for funds it desperately needs to avoid a
default on the payment of external debt because its already fragile
economy, has been shaken further by international sanctions for its
series of nuclear tests in May in response to the hostile neighbor
India.
	   India also faces similar sanctions, but it is less dependent on
foreign loans and aid compared to Islamabad.
	   The IMF stalled an installment of dlrs 1.56 billion loan to
Pakistan after the nuclear tests. The country earlier said it may
seek a moratorium on the payment of external debt if promised loans
are not released.
	   Pakistan's scant foreign exchange reserves have slumped further
to dlrs 697 million this week from dlrs 750 million early this
month, the State Bank of Pakistan said.
	   These reserves are barley enough to meet the country's import
bill of one month and the government is seeking emergency funds to
bridge the balance of payment gap.
	   Pasha said Pakistan will hold further discussions in Washington
for the resumption of its two stalled credit programs of enhanced
structural adjustment facility and enhanced fund facility, but with
expanded balance of payment support.
	   Pasha said the quantum of financing will be around dlrs 5.0
billion, which does not include the dlrs 1.5 billion package agreed
earlier this month with the Islamic Development Bank.
	   He said besides the revival of stalled IMF programs, a possible
debt restructuring and restoration of assistance from the World
Bank was also among components of a relief package sought from the
global donors.
	   The IMF in a statement said it welcomed the fact that despite a
difficult economic environment and sever balance of payments
constraints, Pakistan slashed its inflation and maintained a
buoyant outlook for the agriculture sector growth.

Taliban captures another key district after fierce fighting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's Taliban religious
militia said it captured another stronghold from opposition forces
on Friday after fierce fighting.
	   The Taliban fighters captured Yakaolang district, 200 kilometers
(125 miles) west of the capital Kabul after heavy fighting, a
spokesman of Taliban's Defense Ministry said. The district was
considered a stronghold of Shiite Muslim group Hezb-e-Wahdat
militia.
	   The Taliban spokesman said the opposition had fled from the
district leaving behind large quantity of heavy weapons and
corpses.
	   The Taliban fighters are disarming people in the newly captured
area, the spokesman said.
	   The Taliban, who control most of Afghanistan including the
capital Kabul, has had a string of victories capturing several key
towns and cities from the opposition northern alliance.
	   The northern alliance includes Afghanistan's ethnic and
religious minorities.
	   The Taliban, or students of Islam, mostly belongs to the
majority Pakhtoon ethnic group. They are Sunni Muslims and follows
a strict version of Islam that bars women from work, girls from
education, bans music and forces men to wear beards.

Rugova's closest aide seriously wounded in attack

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Gunmen wounded an aide to the top
Kosovo Albanian leader Friday, days after killing another
associate, in a possible attempt to derail any settlement for the
province short of full independence from Serbia.
	   Serbia continued to shrug off NATO threats of an armed strike if
Kosovo violence is not halted, and claimed its latest offensive in
the southern province has ended with success.
	   Sabri Hamiti was attacked late Thursday in front of his house in
a Pristina suburb, sources close to Rugova said Friday. Two bullets
ended up just above his heart and one broke his arm. Hamiti was
taken to Pristina hospital.
	   Hamiti, 50, is believed to be the closest aide of Rugova, the
main ethnic Albanian political leader in Kosovo. Rugova has showed
readiness to negotiate an agreement for Kosovo that falls short of
independence from Serbian.
	   But ethnic Albanian forces in the Kosovo Liberation Army, are
bent on independence and have pledged to ``punish'' anyone who
gives up that goal.
	   It was not clear who shot Hamiti, but the attack may be a
warning to Rugova by more radical factions among ethnic Albanians
who reject any deal with the government of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic.
	   There have been indications that Rugova and Milosevic could sign
a U.S.-backed agreement that would give Kosovo a degree of
self-rule but would leave it part of Serbia and within Yugoslavia.
	   The militants, who controlled some 40 percent of Kosovo half a
year ago, have largely been defeated by Serb police and the
Yugoslav army in seven months of bloody offensives.
	   While defense ministers from the 15 NATO countries threatened
air strikes and cruise missile attacks, unless the fighting comes
to an end, the Serbian government pledged to use all measures to
wipe out the rebels, which it considers terrorists.
	   The Serbs also announced, through their media center in the
provincial capital Pristina, that the latest offensive on Mt.
Cicavica was over and rebel Albanians had been wiped out.
	   But reporters who were within in two kilometers (roughly a mile)
of the area saw Serb police and Yugoslav troops advance steadily on
rebel Albanians who had fled their the mountain for surrounding
hills.
	   ``All the KLA are in the hills,'' said Ramo, commander of an
Albanian checkpoint about 15 kilometers (nine miles) west of
Pristina.
	   Thick smoke covered most of a six-kilometer (three-mile) horizon
in southern Drenica Friday and machine-guns echoed across the
region's hills.
	   Albanian fighters said police had seized and destroyed six
villages Friday, after taking 14 in the previous two days in the
southern Drenica area. Yugoslav observer jets flew overhead, as the
guerrillas hurriedly ate the first meal they had in two days _
pickled tomatoes, goat's cheese and bread.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources also claimed that 30,000 refugees _
mostly women, children and elderly, many of them wounded _ were
concentrated in the village of Brusnik, on the eastern side of the
Cicavica Mountain.
	   According to the pro-Albanian Kosovo Information Center, seven
Albanians, including an 81-year-old man, were killed in the Drenica
region, bringing the Albanian causalities in the latest offensive
to at least 31.
	   Aid officials estimate that more than 15,000 people have been
displaced in the latest fighting. The International Committee of
the Red Cross said in a statement issued in Belgrade Friday that
its team reached Resnik village in the Drenica region and found
thousands of people were begging for help.
	   We ``were immediately surrounded by thousands of civilians
pleading for assistance and, above all, reassurance about their
security,'' the Red Cross said. ``Many wounded people, victims of
shelling, are in the village and more have been brought down from
the nearby hills since the team arrived.''
	   The Serb crackdown in Kosovo has sent upward 275,000 people
fleeing and claimed hundreds of lives. It has also caused world
alarm over the humanitarian situation, primarily because the
dangers of mass deaths among the estimated 50,000 unsheltered
refugees most at risk by approaching winter.

EU finance chiefs downplay threat from world turmoil

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ European Union finance chiefs Friday
downplayed fears that the spreading international economic turmoil
threatens to derail growth within the EU as it prepares to launch
its single currency.
	   ``Europe has become an anchor of financial stability,'' said
Austrian Finance Minister Rudolf Edlinger. ``We expect dynamic
economic growth in 1999.''
	   His optimism was echoed by other officials gathered in Vienna
for the start of a two-day meeting of EU finance ministers, despite
signs the global turbulence is beginning to take some of the shine
off Europe's economic recovery.
	   Italy forecast its economy will grow just 1.8 percent this year
instead of the 2.5 percent forecast last spring. Chancellor Helmut
Kohl on Thursday revised Germany's growth projection to ``around
2.5 percent'' compared to an earlier forecast of 3 percent.
	   However, EU officials said confidence in the strength of the
coming European currency, the euro, and sound policies producing
low inflation and falling budget deficits would shield Europe from
the worst of the global crisis.
	   ``It wouldn't be right to be overly pessimistic in light of the
global environment and to assume that we will see a global
recession,'' said German central bank president Hans Tietmeyer
before the meeting.
	   On Saturday, the ministers and central bank governors gathered
amid the Rococo splendor of the Hofburg Imperial Palace were
scheduled to focus on the Russian crisis. They will be joined by
Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary
Fund which is holding back payment of the next installments of a
dlrs 22.6 billion loan package until it is satisfied Russia has
sound economic policies.
	   There was little sign the EU was willing to push for more money
for Moscow.
	   ``The EU can do everything in its power to stop Russia feeling
isolated,'' said German Economics Minister Guenther Rexrodt. ``What
we cannot do is give fresh cash.''
	   Less than 100 days away from the launch of the euro on Jan. 1 as
the shared currency of 11 EU nations, the ministers appeared to
make little progress on the final preparations.
	   They shied away from setting a deadline for balancing their
budgets, and big and small EU members remained divided over how the
euro-zone would be represented in international organizations such
as the IMF or the G-7 group of world economic powers.
	   Danish Finance Minister Marianne Jelved said she expected the
meeting Saturday to back Denmarks proposal for exchange-rate
fluctuations between the the Danish krone and the euro to be
limited to within 2.25 percent of a central band.
	   The Danish krone is one of four EU currencies that will not be
absorbed by the euro on Jan. 1. Britain, Sweden and Greece are also
staying out of the monetary union for now.

President pledges to fight corruption
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIHAELA ARMASELU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ In a new attack against Romania's
rampant corruption, President Emil Constantinescu vowed Friday to
continue the fight.
	   ``We have lost some battles, we will lose others, but we can say
that we will win the war,'' Constantinescu told a news conference
broadcast live on state radio and TV.
	   The president, who heads a special department dealing with
corruption and fraud, admitted that the economy has lost 3,500
billion lei (almost dlrs 389 million) in the past 18 months because
of financial irregularities.
	   The sum is equivalent to what the state budget has allotted for
health insurance this year, said Constantinescu.
	   He said only lei 845 billion (almost dlrs 94 million) has been
recovered.
	   Constantinescu, along with experts from the Justice and Interior
ministries, presented the results of his department's fight against
organized crime and a list with the sentences of those convincted
of corruption and the status of corruption investigations.
	   No government members were included on the list of those who
have been sentenced, although Constantinescu admitted that ``people
who occupy important positions have connections with the mafia's
world.''
	   The list included already-announced cases of bankers,
businessmen and ex-directors of state companies sentenced or
investigated for fraud, such as Razvan Temesan, the former head of
Romania's biggest commercial bank, Bancorex.
	   Constantinescu, who was elected in 1996 on promises he would
clean up endemic illegalities, launched a campaign against
corruption in March 1997.
	   But his campaign has been relaunched twice since then, and some
of his former allies accused him of moral weakness and knowingly
keeping corrupt people in his cabinet.
	   Official figures show that illegal business accounted for up to
35 percent of Romania's gross national product last year.
	   The Justice Ministry has been harshly criticized by the media.
Dozens of corruption trials seem to linger on, and magistrates
avoid imposing sentences.
	   Justice Minister Valeriu Stoica told the Libertatea daily
earlier this week that he is disappointed.
	   He admitted many magistrates are ``corrupted and incompetent''
and promised a serious reform in his ministry.

Bjorkman beats Corretja to give Sweden early lead

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Jonas Bjorkman beat Alex Corretja in
four sets Friday to give Sweden a 1-0 lead over Spain in their
Davis Cup semifinal.
	   Returning to the site where he notched one of his finest
tournament victories in the Stockholm Open a year ago, Bjorkman won
6-3, 7-5, 6-7 (5-7), 6-3 in a match that lasted three hours, 25
minutes.
	   The opener ended with the longest game of the match, Bjorkman
finally clinching it on his fourth match point with a volley into
the open court.
	   Bjorkman's hard-fought victory avenged two straight losses to
the Spaniard on hardcourts, including one in the semifinals of the
Dubai Open early this year.
	   U.S. Open quarterfinalist Thomas Johansson, making his first
Davis Cup start for defending champion Sweden, played Spanish No. 1
Carlos Moya later Friday in the second singles match in the
best-of-5 series.
	   Playing before a boisterous sellout crowd of some 4,000 at the
Royal Tennis Hall, Bjorkman got off to a perfect start as he broke
Corretja at love in the opening game. Corretja broke back to 2-2,
but the Swede won the set after breaking Corretja's serve again in
the seventh and ninth games.
	   After trading early breaks in the second set, Bjorkman got his
next chance when Corretja fell behind 0-30 in the 10th game. But
Corretja clawed back to deuce, only to double fault on Bjorkman's
first set point.
	   Both players held their serve throughout the third set, forcing
the tiebreak. A double fault when leading 5-4 proved costly for
Bjorkman. The Swede missed his next two shots, giving Corretja the
lead for the first time in the tiebreak. Ahead 6-5, Corretja
clinched the set when Bjorkman's return sailed long.
	   The semifinal is played on a fast Taraflex court at the Royal
Tennis Hall. A similar fast court was used in the Royal Tennis Hall
when Sweden captured the first of six Davis Cup finals in 1975 with
Bjorn Borg _ a spectator during Friday's matches _ on the team.
	   The United States, shut out by Sweden 5-0 in last year's final
at Goteborg, Sweden, played Italy in the other semifinal in
Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The Davis Cup final is scheduled Dec. 4-6.

U.S. Embassy in Liberia airlifts former warlord away

	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ The United States airlifted former
warlord and now fugitive Roosevelt Johnson out of Liberia on Friday
to end a week-old standoff that began when he sought refuge inside
the American Embassy.
	   One helicopter swooped down on a small landing pad at the back
of the sprawling embassy compound, picked up Johnson and ferried
him away amid heavily armed protection. A second helicopter arrived
shortly afterward to pick up several other people.
	   Although it was not known where Johnson was headed, embassy
officials said the helicopters _ both civilian _ had come from
Freetown, the capital of neighboring Sierra Leone.
	   In Washington, U.S. officials said Johnson planned to go through
Sierra Leone en route to a third country, which was not disclosed.
	   The move to evacuate Johnson from Liberia came after days of
talks between U.S. officials in Washington and President Charles
Taylor's government.
	   Taylor had urged the United States to hand Johnson over to the
government, but the president's spokesman said Thursday there would
be no effort to block Johnson's evacuation.
	   Johnson, Taylor's main rival, had been holed up in the embassy
in the capital, Monrovia, for a week. Liberian soldiers apparently
fired on his group as they were trying to arrange for refuge at the
seaside compound.
	   Fearing another round of fighting, security had been greatly
increased at the embassy and most diplomats were evacuated. U.S.
military reinforcements were sent in to help shore up the embassy's
defenses.
	   At least three of Johnson's supporters were killed in the
shooting and two Americans were injured.
	   Longtime rivals Taylor and Johnson headed opposing factions
during Liberia's seven-year civil war, which ended in 1996.
	   While the two men ostensibly made peace after Taylor was elected
president last year, Johnson's supporters and government soldiers
have repeatedly clashed over the past few months.
	   On Friday, while Johnson was flown away from his country, Taylor
was again declaring victory.
	   ``It is not my victory, it is not your victory, it is not the
victory of the security forces, it is the lord's victory,'' Taylor
told a gathering of church choirs on Friday.
	   Taylor's spokesman Reginald Goodridge said he hoped the United
States would cooperate with Liberia in bringing Johnson to trial on
charges of treason.
	   Johnson's group forced their way through an embassy gate during
the shooting. Although the U.S. Embassy did not want Johnson in the
compound, it has been forced to protect him.
	   American officials, who say Johnson will not be handed over to
the Liberian government, earlier indicated a resolution to the
standoff would involve flying Johnson to a neutral country.
	   U.S. officials say they are concerned Johnson would not receive
a fair trial in Liberia _ as indicated by the use of force against
his reportedly unarmed group in front of the embassy last week.
	   Goodridge has insisted Johnson will be treated justly, saying
that representatives from the United States, international
organizations and human rights groups would be invited to monitor
the proceedings.
	   The latest crisis with Johnson began Sept. 18 when Liberian
troops tried to arrest the former rebel leader. Gun, rocket and
mortar battles erupted in the capital and spilled over toward the
U.S. Embassy compound, eyewitnesses had said. At least 47 people
were killed in the weekend fighting.

	   BERLIN (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl and challenger Gerhard
Schroeder wound up their campaigns Friday running neck and neck in
one of the tightest election races in postwar Germany.
	   Kohl and his Christian Democrats have steadily whittled away at
the early lead enjoyed by the Social Democrats and candidate
Schroeder, and polls now put them virtually even.
	   The Emnid polling institute put the parties within one
percentage point of each other Friday, too close to call: 39
percent for the Christian Democrats, 40 percent for the Social
Democrats.
	   Both candidates staged major rallies Friday evening _ Kohl in
the Rhine River city of Mainz and Schroeder in Berlin _ in a final
push to win over the 24 percent of voters who remain undecided in
the Emnid poll. Both men made the rounds of TV studios for nearly
nightly interviews all week.

	   RAMAT HASHARON, Israel (AP) _ Cedric Pioline and Guillaume Raoux
earned straight-set victories and France took a 2-0 lead over
Israel on Friday in their Davis Cup World Group qualifying tie.
	   Pioline defeated Amir Hadad 6-2, 6-3, 6-3 and Raoux beat Harel
Levy 7-6 (7-1), 6-2, 6-4.
	   Playing before a crowd of 2,000 spectators at the Ramat Hasharon
Tennis Center, the 29-year-old Pioline consistently outclassed his
inexperienced opponent, nine years his junior and making his second
Davis Cup singles appearance.
	   Pioline's powerful, varied serve repeatedly frustrated the
Israeli, who managed only one break throughout the match.
	   The Frenchman took the opening set comfortably with two service
breaks and the second with a single service break. He opened the
third set by breaking Hadad's serve yet again, but appeared to lose
concentration, allowing the Israeli scramble back at 3-3.
	   But Pioline's settled and won the final three games by
repeatedly pressuring Hadad into errors and having little trouble
passing his opponent near the net.
	   The second match opened with a closely fought opening set in
which each player broke service once. But Raoux, 28, ranked 44th in
the world, raced away in the tiebreak, forcing the 20-year-old Levy
into a series of errors.
	   The tiebreak set the pattern for the second set which Raoux took
with two early service breaks. The match was between two baseline
players in which Raoux repeatedly lured his opponent to the net
where Levi made mistakes. The Israeli recovered his composure in
the third set which went to service until the ninth game, when
Raoux broke to 5-4.
	   ``It was a good start for us,'' said the French coach, Yannik
Noah. ``They (the French players) played good tennis today and were
there for the key points.''
	   Noah said that the tentative line-up for Saturday's doubles
match pits France's Nicolas Escude and Jerome Golmard against
Israel's Noam Behr and Eyal Erlich.

In Virgin Islands tourist paradise, farmers take hurricane's brunt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEVE BULLOCK &QC;

<TEXT>
	   CHRISTIANSTED, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ Farmers in St. Croix
buried dead animals and mended fences Friday after Hurricane
Georges swept through the U.S. Virgin Islands.
	   The storm came just as farmers had begun to recover from a
summer drought. They were back at work Wednesday, slicing through
uprooted coconut, mango, avocado and citrus trees with chain saws
and chopping at them with machetes.
	   As skies cleared Friday across the island, the picture was much
the same: farmers repairing fences and breaches, plowing under
crops and burying dead animals.
	   ``All my crops are gone,'' said Leon Thomas as he pointed to a
strand of coconut trees stripped of branches and bent over from the
storm's 110 mph (175 kph) winds that came when the storm passed
over Monday.
	   His cucumbers, okra, peppers, melons and fruit trees were
completely wiped out.
	   ``The farmers took the brunt of the hurricane,'' he said.
	   And more damage also was reported by sheep, goats and cows let
loose before the storm that were eating what was left of the
island's battered plantings.
	   About 15 percent St. Croix's 55,000 inhabitants live off
agriculture or livestock, a higher portion than in the rest of the
U.S. Virgin Islands.
	   Virgin Islands Agriculture Commissioner Arthur Petersen said the
damage was ``considerable'' and offered local and federal aid.
	   Oskar Jones spent thousands of dollars on a state-of-the-art
irrigation system, only to have it destroyed in this week's
tropical fury.
	   ``I know I am taking a big chance to cultivate anything in these
islands, but it's something I like to do,'' said Jones, who spent
Wednesday plowing under the stubble and debris left in Georges'
wake.
	   ``Besides, with so much unemployment in the territory, what else
is there to do?''

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A Bosnian Serb hardliner was

Puerto Rico edges toward normalcy with hard work

	   TOA BAJA, Puerto Rico (AP) _ After Hurricane Hortense's rain
swamped Wanda Cortes' home in a squatter community last year, she
used federal aid to build a second home of plywood on top of what
remained of her house.
	   On Monday, Hurricane Georges' 110 mph (175 kph) winds blew away
her second floor.
	   From the most humble homes to luxury beachfront hotels, people
were feeling the effects of another day without basic services. By
Friday morning, the electric power authority had restored service
to about 7 percent of its customers.
	   Cortes wasn't allowed to build a permanent concrete home because
the community, built six years ago on an abandoned cane field, is
not legal, she said.
	   Her eyes filled with tears and her voice trembled with rage as
she related how municipal officials told her that this time she
will not get the federal aid because the 400-family community is
illegal.
	   ``When (President Bill) Clinton sends the aid, it's for the
people of Puerto Rico, not just for certain people,'' said Cortes,
34, who works as a maid. ``We're human beings, too.''
	   In the San Juan area, power flowed Thursday night to one of the
two main reservoirs that supply water, and the other was expected
to begin producing drinking water Friday afternoon. Water was in
short supply, as hotels and other large buildings exhausted their
storage.
	   Long lines formed under hot sunshine as people waited to fill
jugs with water from tanker trucks supplied by the government.
Thousands lined up at ice factories to buy ice.
	   In the eastern town of San Lorenzo, a 67-year-old woman waiting
in line Thursday to receive an emergency aid check from the
government collapsed and later died, police said.
	   In Puerto Rico, there were 12 storm-related deaths.
	   In the southwestern town of Yauco, police were concerned about a
neighborhood left completely cut off and seriously damaged by the
hurricane. Edwin Ramos, assistant police chief for the southern
region, said 42 people were totally isolated in the hillside area.

Arafat asserts right to declare state; Israel says deal near
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPGRADES attribution on Arafat, Netanyahu remarks &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Heading into a diplomatic showdown with Israel
at the United Nations, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said Friday
he had the ``sacred right'' to declare a state in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip in May and appealed to the world to help him.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had warned only a day
earlier that such a declaration would lead to a ``complete
collapse'' of Mideast peacemaking and that Israel would retaliate.
	   Despite the heated rhetoric, Netanyahu gave an upbeat assessment
of the negotiations with the Palestinians on a West Bank troop
withdrawal. .
	   In a briefing for Israeli reporters in New York, Netanyahu
confirmed that he was ready to withdraw from 13 percent of the West
Bank, with 3 percent of that area set aside as a nature reserve
where Palestinians could not build for the time being.
	   Until now, only Netanyahu's aides, but not the prime minister
himself, have said Israel has accepted the U.S. proposal of a 13
percent pullback, with some strings attached.
	   One senior Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said he believed an agreement with the Palestinians could be signed
within two weeks.
	   Regarding a possible meeting with the Palestinian leader in New
York, Netanyahu said he was ready at any time, but that he believed
such talks were unlikely until some of the remaining gaps were
bridged. U.S. President Bill Clinton has been trying to arrange a
three-way summit to try and conclude an agreement.
	   A Palestinian official confirmed that the two sides are closer
to agreement on the scope of withdrawal than the Palestinians have
let on. However, major differences remain on other issues, such as
how and when the size of an additional withdrawal would be decided,
said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Arafat is to address the U.S. General Assembly on Monday.
	   During a stopover in Liege, Belgium, the Palestinian leader said
he would prefer a negotiated settlement with Israel by May 4, the
day the five-year interim of Palestinian autonomy ends.
	   After that date, Arafat said he would make use of his ``sacred
right'' to declare statehood and would seek the world's help.
	   ``We will look with hope and trust to our friends and
peace-loving nations of the international community to support the
Palestinian people in their declaration of an independent state on
May 4, 1999,'' Arafat said in his Liege speech distributed by the
Palestinian news agency Wafa.
	   Addressing Israeli fears, Arafat also said the state would seek
peaceful relations with its neighbors and would not react to
provocations unless its security or vital interests were harmed.

Mandela feted by Canadian schoolchildren
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Mandela canceling appearances, not feeling well &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Before a festive throng of schoolchildren, Nelson
Mandela offered friendly advice to Canada on Friday: Give women a
bigger political role and address French-English differences in a
spirit of togetherness.
	   After curtain-raisers including rap music and a circus act, the
South African president touched on serious themes in a speech to
about 40,000 people, mostly children, at the SkyDome, Canada's
largest sports stadium.
	   He spoke at length about the hardships and challenges facing
children in South Africa, and the toll inflicted on children
worldwide by malnutrition, poverty and disease.
	   He recounted how he and other anti-apartheid activists yearned
for the sights and sounds of children during their years in prison
under white-minority rule.
	   ``When we were freed, we found there were no longer many
children in South Africa who could laugh,'' he said. ``The children
were forced to grow up very quickly.''
	   The event was aimed at building support for the Nelson Mandela
Children's Fund, which seeks to raise money for disadvantaged
children in South Africa.
	   ``The greatest joy has been to discover that there are so many
children in this country who care about other children around the
world,'' the 80-year-old statesman said. ``You have made me feel
like a young man again with my batteries recharged.''
	   Later in the day, a fatigued Mandela left early from a lunch
with business executives and canceled a scheduled news conference.
	   ``He has been examined by his physician,'' said his chief of
staff, Jakes Gerwel. ``There's nothing wrong with him, but he is
very exhausted.''

Three sentenced to death in Cameroon for beheading boy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YAOUNDE, Cameroon (AP) _ A court on Friday sentenced two
Nigerians and a Cameroon man to death by firing squad for the 1996
murder and beheading of an 11-year-old boy.
	   The regional court in Bassoussam, about 400 kilometers (250
miles) west of the capital Yaounde, also ordered the men to pay
more than dlrs 16,000 each in compensation to the victim's parents.
	   Augustine Ihezie and Jerry Obassi were both caught two years ago
carrying the boy's severed head in a canvas bag, the court was told
during their trial.
	   According to court documents, the men intended to sell the head
for use in a macabre ritual, of which the details were not
disclosed.
	   A third man, Cameroonian Soh Kamte, was accused of helping the
Nigerians and received the death penalty for his role in the crime.
	   Lawyers for all three men said they intend to appeal the
sentences.

	   Poplasen won by 38,000 votes, officials said.
	   Announcement of results was postponed for more than 10 days, due
to complicated counting procedure and technical problems, OSCE
said.
	   The organization said Friday's results, are still unofficial and
pending certification by an electoral commission. Until that
happens, OSCE said they were withholding announcement of seat
allocations.
	   Western officials said vote showed a positive trend, as
nationalist hard-line parties continued to lose support in other
parts of the country.
	   Opposition parties did well in the National Assembly of the
Serb-held half of the country. Opposition parties won four
additional seats, giving them a majority of 48 seats, officials
said.
	   A strong showing of moderate parties in the assembly of the Serb
republic could neutralize eventual attempts of Poplasen to nominate
a hard-liner for premier or to move away from Bosnia's peace
accord.
	   Moderate opposition parties did well in the Serb substate, the
Muslim-Croat federation, which makes up the other half of Bosnia,
and parliament.
	   Pro-Western Serb candidate for the three-member joint
presidency, Zivko Radisic, won over the hard-line candidate,
Momcilo Krajisnik, who was seen as one of the biggest obstacles to
the work of joint Bosnian institutions.
	   In the 15-seat Lower House of the Bosnian joint parliament, the
pro-Plavsic coalition appears to have won at least two of five Serb
seats. Previously Serb hard-liners held all five seats.
	   Among Muslim candidates for the joint Bosnian presidency, the
wartime leader of the Muslims and the current chairman of the
presidency, Alija Izetbegovic, won most votes and retained his
position.
	   The Western-backed Croat candidate for the presidency, Kresimir
Zubak, has lost to Ante Jelavic, a Croat hard-liner, indicating
that most of the Bosnian Croats are still controlled by Croat
hard-liners and their protegee, Croatian president Franjo Tudjman.
	   Yet, even Zubak said before the ballot that he would be
satisfied with anything more than 20 percent of the Bosnian Croat
votes.
	   Across the Muslim-Croat federation moderate parties have got
closer to the nationalist ruling parties.

Indian president takes on federal government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NEELESH MISRA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Indian President K.R. Narayanan defied
the conventional norms set for his figurehead position Friday, by
rejecting a cabinet decision to sack the government of the state
considered the country's most lawless.
	   Acting after four days of consultations with politicians and
legal experts on what became a major issue in Indian politics,
Narayanan refused to allow Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to
dismiss the government of Bihar state, Press Trust of India said
quoting sources in Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party.
	   Narayanan's assent was necessary for the decision to be
enforced. It was the second time in a year that the president
rejected a recommendation by the ruling party.
	   Narayanan, India's first president from the Indian class once
known as ``untouchables,'' broke new ground last year by refusing
to allow the then socialist government to dismiss in similar manner
a state government headed by Vajpayee's BJP, saying there weren't
enough grounds for the sacking.
	   On several other occasions, Narayanan has chosen to do what none
of his predecessors did _ like standing with common people in a
balloting station queue.
	   Vajpayee says law and order has deteriorated in the eastern
Bihar state under the Rashtriya Loktantrik Morcha party. The
party's leaders say law and order in Bihar as good or as bad as
several other states in the country, including several governed by
Vajpayee's party.
	   Voting would not normally be held before 2000 for the state
assembly in Bihar, India's second most populous state.
	   Vajpayee's decision provoked violent protests in Bihar. A man
was reported dead and hundreds of protesters clashed with police
and sabotaged railroad lines.
	   Federal officials say that while the state's chief minister
Rabri Devi has the majority in the legislature, she has lost
control of law and order in Bihar. Most of the lawmakers in the
state legislature have criminal records and have frequently been
accused of switching political loyalty in return for hefty bribes.
	   Devi's husband, Laloo Prasad Yadav, resigned as chief minister
last year after a court charged him with siphoning off millions of
dollars in government funds.
	   Yadav immediately appointed his wife chief minister but he
continues to wield enormous power from behind the scenes even as
his trial continues.
	   On Friday, the Supreme Court rejected a plea from Yadav seeking
bail in anticipation of arrest, and ordered him to surrender in
court during the next hearing in October.

pending certification by an electoral commission. Until that
happens, OSCE said they were withholding announcement of seat
allocations.
	   Western officials said the vote showed a positive trend, as
nationalist hard-line parties continued to lose support in other
parts of the country.
	   Moderate opposition parties did well in the National Assembly of
the Serb-held half of the country, winning four additional seats
for a majority of 48 seats, officials said.
	   A strong showing of moderate parties in the assembly of the Serb
republic could neutralize eventual attempts by Poplasen to nominate
a hard-liner for premier or to move away from Bosnia's peace
accord.
	   Moderate opposition parties did well in the Serb substate, the
Muslim-Croat federation, which makes up the other half of Bosnia,
and parliament.

	   The pro-Western Serb candidate for the three-member joint
presidency, Zivko Radisic, won over the hard-line candidate,
Momcilo Krajisnik, who was seen as one of the biggest obstacles to
the smooth joint administration of Bosnian institutions.
	   In the 15-seat Lower House of the Bosnian joint parliament, the
pro-Plavsic coalition appears to have won at least two of five Serb
seats. Previously, Serb hard-liners held all five seats.
	   Among Muslim candidates for the joint Bosnian presidency, the
wartime leader of the Muslims and the current chairman of the
presidency, Alija Izetbegovic, won most votes and retained his
position.
	   The Western-backed Croat candidate for the presidency, Kresimir
Zubak, has lost to Ante Jelavic, a Croat hard-liner, indicating
that most of the Bosnian Croats are still controlled by Croat
hard-liners and their protegee, Croatian president Franjo Tudjman.
	   Zubak said before the ballot that he would be satisfied with
anything more than 20 percent of the Bosnian Croat votes.

Cyprus insists on solution according to UN resolutions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Clerides saying he is committed to deployment in
new grafs 10-11. Picks up 10th graf pvs. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The president of Cyprus on Friday rejected
Turkish proposals that the war-divided island become a
confederation, saying a solution to the conflict must take place on
the basis of U.N. resolutions.
	   Glafcos Clerides said in a speech at the U.N. General Assembly
that Turkish-Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash put forward the idea of a
confederation in order to create a ``Turkish colony'' in Cyprus.
	   The Cypriot government, with the support of the five permanent
members of the Security Council, rejects any proposal that would
consolidate the Mediterranean island's division.
	   Accepting the proposal, the Cypriot government says, would
necessitate recognition of the breakaway Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus, which is recognized only by Turkey. Ankara
maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   ``The recent demand of the Turkish-Cypriot leader Mr. Denktash
in the presence of the Turkish foreign minister for a confederation
solution violates all U.N. resolutions,'' Clerides said.
	   He said it was ``aimed at derailing the negotiating process from
the base of the U.N. resolutions on Cyprus, but also at
extinguishing the independence of the Republic of Cyprus and
creating, under the guise of a Turkish Cypriot Republic a Turkish
colony in Cyprus, or to say the least, a Turkish protectorate.''
	   Cyprus has been divided into a Greek Cypriot-controlled south
and a Turkish-occupied north since a 1974 Turkish invasion
following an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   Clerides said Cyprus was ``committed to a peaceful solution on
the basis of the United Nations resolutions.''
	   The United States is anxious to restart U.N.-sponsored peace
talks that have been stalled since August and to persuade Cyprus to
cancel the planned deployment of Russian S-300 anti-aircraft
missiles in November.
	   Clerides told reporters after his speech that he was committed
to the deployment, but would not say when that would happen.
	   ``As long as Turkey's forces remain in Cyprus we will import
whatever weapons necessary for our defense,'' Clerides said. ``The
S-300s were a necessity of the fact that we have no air force, and
have often been reminded that Turkey's air force is only 2 1/2
minutes flying time from the capital of Cyprus.''

Nikola Poplasen: Bosnian Serb ultranationalist turned president
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Sarajevo - Bosnia Elections &QL; 
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The newly elected Bosnian
Serb president embodies everything the West opposes for the
country.
	   Nikola Poplasen heads the most extreme nationalist party in the
Serb-run half of Bosnia. He was a paramilitary commander during the
3 1-2 -year war. He is a supporter of war crimes suspect Radovan
Karadzic and has his own interpretation of the 1995 U.S.-sponsored
Dayton peace accord for Bosnia.
	   But on Friday, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe confirmed Poplasen defeated U.S.-backed Biljana Plavsic for
president of the Bosnian Serb republic during nationwide balloting
Sept. 12-13.
	   OSCE, which ran the election, has tried to spin a generally
favorable interpretation of the balloting, noting that moderates
scored significant gains in other races.
	   Nevertheless, Poplasen's victory has dealt the most humiliating
blow to international efforts to cement peace, restart ethnic
tolerance and impose democracy in Bosnia since the Dayton agreement
ended the war.
	   A large picture of Poplasen in uniform, brandishing a machine
gun, adorns the entrance to his Banja Luka office.
	   But the bearded 47-year-old, with a pale, drawn face and pale
green eyes, resembles only a shadow of the fierce image he conveyed
as a paramilitary Serb wartime commander. Translated into English,
his name means ``scared,'' and the slender, slightly hunched
Poplasen now looks more like a political science professor _ his
pre-war job at a local university.
	   ``I ended up in politics due to circumstance and not by personal
choice,'' Poplasen likes to say of himself.
	   Born in the north of neighboring Serbia, Poplasen came to Bosnia
as a 19-year-old to study sociology at Sarajevo University. He
ended up teaching there, also earning a doctorate in political
science.
	   The early days of the war saw the beginning of Poplasen's
political career, which instantly launched him into the top ranks
of then-leader Karadzic's council of closest advisers.
	   On Karadzic's instructions, Poplasen spent the first half of the
war in charge of Vogosca, a Sarajevo suburb then controlled by the
Bosnian Serbs. Biljana Plavic, whom he defeated in this month's
elections, has accused him of involvement in a major embezzlement
linked to a Volkswagen factory where hundreds of cars disappeared
from a parking lot without a trace.
	   In 1993, Poplasen settled in Banja Luka, the largest
Serb-controlled city in Bosnia, with his wife and their three
children. The same year, he joined the Serb Radical Party, headed
in Serbia by extreme ultranationalist Vojislav Seselj.
	   During the war, Poplasen commanded a student army brigade from
Banja Luka University which fought on the front lines in western
Bosnia. Seselj proclaimed him a Chetnik Duke _ the highest honor
for extreme nationalist Serb paramilitary troops who have spread
tremendous fear among Bosnia's rival Muslims and Croats.
	   Aware that his war-time biography counts heavily against him in
the eyes of Western officials in Bosnia, Poplasen recently sought
to downplay their fears, pledging to cooperate.
	   ``The Dayton peace agreement will be implemented to the letter,
nothing more and nothing less,'' he told The Associated Press.
	   But Poplasen has said Dayton never envisioned the joint life for
Bosnia's Serbs, Croats and Muslims in a single state, something the
United States and the other Western countries have been striving
for.
	   The top U.S. official for the Balkans puts more stock in
Poplasen's war-time behavior than in his promises of cooperation.
	   ``Based on the past, I would be misleading you if I did not tell
you we have the most serious questions'' about Poplasen, Robert
Gelbard said.

	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ The United States airlifted former
warlord and now fugitive Roosevelt Johnson out of Liberia on Friday
to end a week-old standoff that began when he sought refuge inside
the American Embassy.
	   One helicopter swooped down on a small landing pad at the back
of the sprawling embassy compound, picked up Johnson and ferried
him away amid tight security. A second helicopter arrived shortly
afterward to pick up several other people.
	   Although it was not known where Johnson was headed, embassy
officials said the helicopters _ both civilian _ had come from
Freetown, the capital of neighboring Sierra Leone.
	   The Pentagon said the helicopters belonged to the Nigerian-led
West African intervention force known as ECOMOG, which maintains
peacekeeping troops in both Liberia and Sierra Leone.

Bjorkman beats Corretja to give Sweden early lead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes: will be updated after Johansson-Moya
match &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHAN NASSTROM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Jonas Bjorkman beat Alex Corretja in
four sets Friday to give Sweden a 1-0 lead over Spain in their
Davis Cup semifinal.
	   Bjorkman, returning to the site where he notched one of his
finest tournament victories in the Stockholm Open a year ago, won
6-3, 7-5, 6-7 (5-7), 6-3 in a match that lasted three hours, 25
minutes.
	   ``I haven't played much better serve-and-volley tennis than
this,'' Bjorkman said. ``I'm extremely happy. It was one of my best
matches in the Davis Cup.
	   ``The match was what I expected it to be. We know that these
guys can play well even on this (fast) surface. But I would have
been glad if the match had been shorter.''
	   The Swedish No. 1 will be back Saturday for the doubles match
with Nicklas Kulti against veteran Javier Sanchez and Julian
Alonso.
	   During the match, Bjorkman broke the nail on his big toe ``but
it should be no problem for the doubles,'' he said.
	   The opener ended with the longest game of the match, Bjorkman
finally clinching it on his fourth match point with a volley into
the open court.
	   Bjorkman's victory avenged two straight losses to the Spaniard
on hardcourts, including one in the semifinals of the Dubai Open
early this year.
	   U.S. Open quarterfinalist Thomas Johansson, making his first
Davis Cup start for defending champion Sweden, played Spanish No. 1
Carlos Moya later Friday in the second singles match in the
best-of-5 series.
	   Playing before a boisterous sellout crowd of some 4,000 at the
Royal Tennis Hall, Bjorkman got off to a perfect start as he broke
Corretja at love in the opening game. Corretja broke back to 2-2,
but the Swede won the set after breaking Corretja's serve again in
the seventh and ninth games.
	   After trading early breaks in the second set, Bjorkman got his
next chance when Corretja fell behind 0-30 in the 10th game. But
Corretja clawed back to deuce, only to double fault on Bjorkman's
first set point.
	   Both players held their serve throughout the third set, forcing
the tiebreak. A double fault when leading 5-4 proved costly for
Bjorkman. The Swede missed his next two shots, giving Corretja the
lead for the first time in the tiebreak. Ahead 6-5, Corretja
clinched the set when Bjorkman's return sailed long.
	   ``It's difficult to get used to the court,'' Corretja said. ``I
haven't played indoors in 10 months. And I felt the pressure,
playing the first match.''
	   Spain reached Davis Cup final twice in the 1960s, but never won
the prestigious team competition. Sweden has won six times, twice
in the last four including last year.
	   The semifinal is being played on a fast Taraflex court at the
Royal Tennis Hall. A similar fast court was used in the Royal
Tennis Hall when Sweden captured the first of six Davis Cup finals
in 1975 with Bjorn Borg _ a spectator during Friday's matches _ on
the team.
	   The United States, shut out by Sweden 5-0 in last year's final
at Goteborg, Sweden, is playing Italy in the other semifinal this
weekend in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The Davis Cup final is scheduled
Dec. 4-6.

Arafat asserts right to declare state; Israel says deal near
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Arafat calling on the international
community to help the Palestinians declare their state in May;
EDITS to TRIM &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Heading into a diplomatic showdown with Israel
at the United Nations, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said Friday
he had the ``sacred right'' to declare a state in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip in May and appealed to the world to help him.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had warned only a day
earlier that such a declaration would lead to a ``complete
collapse'' of Mideast peacemaking and that Israel would retaliate.
	   Despite the heated rhetoric, Netanyahu gave an upbeat assessment
of the negotiations with the Palestinians on a West Bank troop
withdrawal.
	   In a briefing for Israeli reporters in New York, Netanyahu
confirmed that he was ready to withdraw from 13 percent of the West
Bank, with 3 percent of that area set aside as a nature reserve
where Palestinians could not build for the time being.
	   Until now, only Netanyahu's aides, but not the prime minister
himself, have said Israel has accepted the U.S. proposal of a 13
percent pullback, with some strings attached.
	   One senior Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said he believed an agreement with the Palestinians could be signed
within two weeks.
	   Regarding a possible meeting with the Palestinian leader in New
York, Netanyahu said he was ready at any time, but that he believed
such talks were unlikely until some of the remaining gaps were
bridged. U.S. President Bill Clinton has been trying to arrange a
three-way summit to try and conclude an agreement.
	   A Palestinian official confirmed that the two sides are closer
to agreement on the scope of withdrawal than the Palestinians have
let on. However, major differences remain on other issues, such as
how and when the size of an additional withdrawal would be decided,
said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Arafat is to address the U.S. General Assembly on Monday.
	   During a stopover in Liege, Belgium, the Palestinian leader said
he would prefer a negotiated settlement with Israel by May 4, the
day the five-year interim of Palestinian autonomy ends.
	   After that date, Arafat said he would make use of his ``sacred
right'' to declare statehood and would seek the world's help.
	   ``We will look with hope and trust to our friends and
peace-loving nations of the international community to support the
Palestinian people in their declaration of an independent state on
May 4, 1999,'' Arafat said in his Liege speech distributed by the
Palestinian news agency Wafa.
	   Arafat's spokesman, Nabil Abourdeneh, told the Voice of
Palestine radio that the Palestinian leader will also raise the
statehood issue in his speech before the United Nations on Monday
and seek world support.
	   Many countries are expected to recognize a Palestinian state,
and Netanyahu has been trying to thwart the Palestinian campaign
for international backing.
	   In Israel, Arafat's call prompted demands that Netanyahu break
off the negotiations with the Palestinians on a troop withdrawal.
	   ``Arafat is already announcing now his intention to blatantly
violate the Oslo (peace) agreement by declaring a state in seven
months,'' said Uzi Landau, a legislator from Netanyahu's Likud
Party. ``It doesn't make sense that Israel will continue to
negotiate in the spirit of Oslo.''
	   Under the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreements, the period of
Palestinian autonomy expires on May 4. By that time, the two sides
are to have negotiated a permanent peace accord that would
determine the nature and borders of the Palestinian entity.
	   With both sides still hung up over interim issues, such as a
staged Israeli troop pullback in the West Bank, it appears very
unlikely such an agreement can be concluded on deadline.

Egypt: Israel using security considerations to justify occupation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Egypt's foreign minister warned Friday
that the Mideast peace process was near collapse, and accused
Israel of using security considerations to justify its occupation
of Arab land.
	   ``We reject this Israeli policy which uses security
considerations to justify occupation,'' Amr Moussa told world
leaders at the U.N. General Assembly.
	   ``The validity, true weight and credibility of those Israeli
security requirements have become doubtful,'' said Moussa, whose
country was the first Arab nation to establish diplomatic ties with
Israel, in 1978.
	   Accusing Israel of dragging its feet on the peace process,
Moussa said: ``We wonder what the Israeli government really wants.
The Arabs have given them acceptance, coexistence, cooperation,
recognition, and peace.
	   ``But it would seem that what the Israeli government really
wants is all of the above in addition to most of the land and an
unjust disregard of the rights of the Palestinians. This is simply
impossible.''
	   Moussa said Israel must agree on a comprehensive package that
includes complete Israeli withdrawal from all war-gained Arab land,
and from the West Bank and Gaza. It would also have to agree to the
establishment of a Palestinian state and talks on the final status
of Jerusalem.
	   On Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned
the General Assembly that a unilateral declaration of independence
by the Palestinians would sabotage the peace process.
	   Speaking four days before Yasser Arafat makes a rare appearance
at the world body, Netanyahu said a statehood announcement by the
Palestinian leader would provoke an Israeli reaction.
	   Palestinian negotiators said Arafat will use his U.N. appearance
to win global backing for independence in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip. Arafat has said he will declare statehood on May 4, 1999,
regardless of whether a final peace agreement with Israel had been
negotiated.

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The government imposed foreign exchange
restrictions Friday and doubled import duties on whisky,
electronics and other luxury goods in an effort to boost the
sagging national currency.
	   The Zimbabwe dollar closed at 32.4 per U.S. dollar, much
stronger than the record low rate of 37.8 a day earlier.
	   The exchange rate started the year at about 17 to 1.
	   Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa said the measures were designed
to stop the nation's hard currency reserves from being drained, and
``bring about a modicum of stability in the foreign exchange
market.''
	   The government also imposed a 10 percent surtax on all imports.
	   Luxury goods such as wines, toys, furniture and cars already are
taxed at up to 80 percent of their normal sale price. A bottle of
whisky that now costs 220 Zimbabwe dollars (U.S. dlrs 7) was
expected to sell for almost double.

Rugova's closest aide seriously wounded in attack

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Gunmen wounded an aide to the top
Kosovo Albanian leader Friday in a possible attempt to derail any
settlement for the province short of full independence from Serbia.
	   Serbia continued to shrug off NATO threats of an armed strike if
violence isn't halted, and claimed its latest offensive was a
success.
	   Sabri Hamiti was attacked late Thursday in front of his house in
a Pristina suburb, sources close to pacifist Ibrahim Rugova said
Friday. Two bullets ended up just above his heart and one broke his
arm. Hamiti was taken to Pristina hospital.
	   Hamiti, 50, is believed to be the closest aide of Rugova, the
main ethnic Albanian political leader in Kosovo. Rugova has showed
readiness to negotiate an agreement for Kosovo that falls short of
independence from Serbia.
	   But ethnic Albanian forces in the Kosovo Liberation Army, are
bent on independence and have pledged to ``punish'' anyone who
gives up that goal.
	   It was not clear who shot Hamiti, but the attack may be a
warning to Rugova by more radical factions among ethnic Albanians
who reject any deal with the government of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic.
	   The militants, who controlled some 40 percent of Kosovo half a
year ago, have largely been defeated by Serb police and the
Yugoslav army in seven months of bloody offensives.
	   While defense ministers from the 15 NATO countries threatened
air strikes and cruise missile attacks unless the fighting comes to
an end, the Serbian government pledged to use all measures to wipe
out the rebels, which it considers terrorists.
	   The Serbs also announced, through their media center in the
provincial capital Pristina, that the latest offensive on Mount
Cicavica was over and rebel Albanians had been wiped out.
	   But reporters who were within 2 kilometers (1 mile) of the area
saw Serb police and Yugoslav troops advance steadily on rebel
Albanians who had fled their the mountain for surrounding hills.
	   ``All the KLA are in the hills,'' said Ramo, commander of an
Albanian checkpoint about 15 kilometers (9 miles) west of Pristina.
	   Thick smoke covered most of a 6-kilometer (3-mile) horizon in
southern Drenica on Friday and machine-guns echoed across the
region's hills.
	   Albanian fighters said police had seized and destroyed six
villages Friday, after taking 14 in the previous two days in the
southern Drenica area. Yugoslav observer jets flew overhead, as the
guerrillas hurriedly ate the first meal they had in two days of
pickled tomatoes, goat's cheese and bread.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources also claimed that 30,000 refugees _
mostly women, children and elderly, many of them wounded _ were
concentrated in the village of Brusnik, on the eastern side of the
Cicavica Mountain.
	   According to the pro-Albanian Kosovo Information Center, seven
Albanians, including an 81-year-old man, were killed in the Drenica
region, bringing the Albanian causalities in the latest offensive
to at least 31.
	   The Serb crackdown in Kosovo has sent about 275,000 people
fleeing and claimed hundreds of lives. An estimated 50,000
unsheltered refugees are also at risk with the approaching winter.

Yugoslavia accuses Kosovo Albanians of provoking outside
</HEADLINE>
intervention &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Yugoslavia's acting U.N. ambassador
accused Kosovo's ethnic Albanian leaders Friday of refusing to
negotiate to provoke a humanitarian crisis and possible outside
military intervention.
	   Ethnic Albanian political leaders, including Ibrahim Rugova,
don't want to resume talks with the Yugoslav government because
``they know that they cannot achieve separatist goals through
dialogue,'' Ambassador Vladislav Jovanovic told a news conference
at the United Nations.
	   Kosovo is a province in Serbia, the dominant remaining republic
in former Yugoslavia. The majority of Kosovo's population is ethnic
Albanian, and most Kosovo Albanians want independence, but
Yugoslavia and the West have ruled it out. Western nations support
restoring autonomy for Kosovo within Yugoslavia.
	   The rebel ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which has been
fighting for independence, has pledged to punish anyone who gives
up that goal. But the militants, who controlled some 40 percent of
Kosovo six months ago, have been largely defeated by Serbian police
and the Yugoslav army.
	   Jovanovic said that since ethnic Albanian political leaders know
they can't win independence, they are using the rebel fighters ``to
make matters worse.''
	   Their aim, he said, is ``to create, if not the reality than at
least a semblance of a humanitarian catastrophe, on the basis of
which they could expect international force to organize a military
expedition or doing something of that type.''
	   The U.N. Security Council adopted a tough resolution on Kosovo
Wednesday and NATO on Thursday instructed its generals to prepare
for air strikes unless Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic halts
attacks against the remnants of the KLA.
	   Jovanovic said Serbian police and security forces were attacking
``terrorists,'' not civilians, although he conceded that some
civilians had been unintentionally killed in the fighting.
	   ``According to all observers, the total number of all casualties
both on police, terrorists and the civilian side doesn't exceed 500
people,'' he said.
	   The figure includes 200 ``armed Albanians and terrorists'' who
died during clashes with police, he said. Twenty men suspected of
being members of terrorist groups have been captured and will be
tried, he said.
	   Jovanovic said the relatively low casualty toll over six months
``is not a reason for the outcries (that) there is repression
against civilians _ and certainly not the reason for claiming that
our legitimate fighting against terrorism constitutes any threat to
the peace and stability.
	   ``This is a deliberate exaggeration in order to justify
different forms of interference from abroad in order to influence
the final outcome of the problem of Kosovo, which is to be settled
only by political means and dialogue,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   CHRISTIANSTED, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ Cruise ships docked in
St. Thomas' pier and passengers strolled Danish-themed streets
Friday as U.S. Virgin Islanders marched back to recovery from
Hurricane Georges.
	   Hotels on St. Thomas and St. John escaped significant damage,
and 90 percent of some 4,000 rooms were open, said Richard Doumeng
of the St. Thomas-St. John Hotel Association.
	   Some hotels on St. Croix sustained damage when the storm swept
past on Monday.
	   ``We don't want to minimize the effect the hurricane has had on
private citizens. But the tourism industry is virtually
untouched,'' Doumeng said.
	   The U.S. Virgin Islands, population 114,000, has an economy
built on tourism, refining and light manufacturing. Each year,
hundreds of thousands of vacationers pour into St. Thomas, St.
Croix and St. John to enjoy their beaches and duty-free shopping.
President Bill Clinton vacationed here on the past two New Year's.
	   Tourism took a blow when Hurricane Marilyn struck in 1995, and
many hotels only fully recovered over the past year. So it was a
matter of relief for hoteliers that Georges path past the islands
paled in comparison to Marilyn.
	   Three cruise ships were in port Friday in Charlotte Amalie, St.
Thomas, their passengers perusing wares in jewelry and trinkets
shops. Power on St. Thomas was nearly totally restored.
	   ``We caught a break. We are lucky. We have been spared the wrath
of this hurricane,'' Doumeng said.
	   In St. Croix, some inns were moderately damaged but repairs were
well underway. Small boats driven onto streets Monday had been
removed. But dozens of homes _ many of them with plastic tarp roofs
from Hurricane Marilyn in 1995 _ were damaged.
	   Small farmers on St. Croix may have been hit the hardest of all.
Farmers mended broken fences, repaired breaches, buried dead
animals, pruned back fruit trees and plowed under ruined crops.
	   ``All my crops are gone,'' said Leon Thomas as he pointed to a
stand of coconut trees stripped of branches and bent over from the
storm. His cucumbers, okra, peppers, melons and fruit trees were
wiped out.
	   ``We the farmers took the brunt of the hurricane,'' he said.
	   About 15 percent of St. Croix's 55,000 inhabitants live off
agriculture or livestock, a higher portion than in the rest of the
U.S. Virgin Islands.
	   Virgin Islands Agriculture Commissioner Arthur Petersen said the
damage was ``considerable'' and offered local and federal aid to
planters who can document their losses.
	   It was good news for a stubborn group which has bounced back
from one setback after another. Farmers had just begun to recover
from a summer drought.
	   They were back at work this week, slicing through uprooted
coconut, mango, avocado and citrus trees with chain saws and
chopping at them with machetes.
	   Oskar Jones spent thousands of dollars on a state-of-the-art
irrigation system, only to have it destroyed by Georges.
	   ``I know I am taking a big chance to cultivate anything in these
islands, but it's something I like to do,'' said Jones, who spent
Wednesday plowing under the stubble.

	   TOA BAJA, Puerto Rico (AP) _ After Hurricane Hortense's rain
swamped Wanda Cortes' home in a squatter community last year, she
used federal aid to build a second home of plywood on top of what
remained of her house.
	   On Monday, Hurricane Georges' 110 mph (175 kph) winds blew away
her second floor.
	   From the most humble homes to luxury beachfront hotels, people
were feeling the effects of another day without basic services. By
Friday morning, the electric power authority had restored service
to about 7 percent of its customers.
	   Cortes wasn't allowed to build a permanent concrete home because
the community, built six years ago on an abandoned cane field, is
not legal, she said.
	   Her eyes filled with tears and her voice trembled with rage as
she related how municipal officials told her that this time she
will not get the federal aid because the 400-family community is
illegal.
	   ``When (President Bill) Clinton sends the aid, it's for the
people of Puerto Rico, not just for certain people,'' said Cortes,
34, who works as a maid. ``We're human beings, too.''
	   In the San Juan area, power flowed Thursday night to one of the
two main reservoirs that supply water, and the other was expected
to begin producing drinking water Friday afternoon. Water was in
short supply, as hotels and other large buildings exhausted their
storage.
	   Long lines formed under hot sunshine as people waited to fill
jugs with water from tanker trucks supplied by the government.
Thousands lined up at ice factories to buy ice.
	   In the eastern town of San Lorenzo, a 67-year-old woman waiting
in line Thursday to receive an emergency aid check from the
government collapsed and later died, police said.
	   In Puerto Rico, there were 12 storm-related deaths.
	   In the southwestern town of Yauco, police were concerned about a
neighborhood left completely cut off and seriously damaged by the
hurricane. Edwin Ramos, assistant police chief for the southern
region, said 42 people were totally isolated in the hillside area.

Canada urges all countries to sign land mine treaty
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Canada's foreign minister on Friday urged
all countries that had not done so to sign a treaty banning land
mines, and called for efforts to curb the proliferation of small
arms.
	   Lloyd Axworthy noted that last week Burkina Faso had become the
40th country to sign on to the treaty, known as the Ottawa
Convention, crossing the threshold needed to bring the treaty into
force in March.
	   ``Now, we have to meet the treaty's goals,'' Axworthy told world
leaders at the U.N. General Assembly.
	   Nations that ratify the treaty, which will take effect in six
months, pledge to destroy all stockpiles of mines within four years
and clear all mines from their territory within 10 years.
	   Tens of millions of land mines are scattered in more than 60
countries, and they kill or injure an estimated 20,000 people each
year, mostly innocent civilians. The mines have also rendered huge
swaths of productive land unusable.
	   ``We continue to urge those who have not done so to sign and
ratify the convention,'' Axworthy said.
	   The United States has been among countries that have refused to
sign the treaty.
	   ``My government has allocated 100 million dollars as Canada's
contribution to rid the world of these cruel weapons,'' Axworthy
said. ``We have already put this money to work in the most severely
affected states, with projects in Mozambique, Cambodia, Bosnia and
Central America.''
	   Axworthy said land mines are not the only weapons that claim
many civilian victims. ``Small arms and light military weapons,
cheap and easy to transport, smuggle or hide _ have become the
tools of choice for drug smugglers, terrorists and criminals.''
	   He said Canada was trying to meet the challenges of trying to
curb small arms proliferation.

	   Young People Encouraged to Vote
	   PHOENIX (AP) _ Happy birthday! Now go vote.
	   With the turnout for midterm elections among voters age 18 to 24
paltry at best, Arizona officials are using a birthday message to
encourage 18-year-olds to head to the ballot box.
	   The Secretary of State's office and the Rock the Vote
organization are mailing birthday cards to every Arizona voter
turning 18 before the Nov. 3 election.
	   The card contains a birthday message and a letter from Secretary
of State Betsey Bayless explaining how and when to register for the
primary and general elections. It also includes a pre-addressed
voter registration form.
	   ``This is a fun reminder that the time has come to register to
vote,'' Bayless said Friday. ``There're a lot of people who are
going to miss this if we don't get some information out to them.''
	   In the 1994 election, less than half of those ages 18 to 24 were
registered to vote in Arizona, and only 20 percent in that age
group cast ballots.
	   Bayless is running for election in November for the post to
which she was appointed. ``The bottom line is if you want to make a
change, you have to participate,'' she said.
	   Henry Thomas, who turns 18 in October, will be one of the 25,000
Arizonans turning 18 who are expected to receive a card in the mail
next week. He thinks the cards are a good idea.
	   ``To get something done, somebody's going to have to vote, to
put out some effort,'' he said. ``I'll vote. I'll vote in a minute
because I think it's important.''
	   Arizona is the second state to mail such birthday cards, state
officials said. The idea came from a California office that began
sending them a few years ago.
	   Matt Moseley, national field director for Rock the Vote, a group
that promotes voting among the young, said plans are in the works
to use California and Arizona as models for a national mailing to
young voters for the 2000 election.
	   ``Imagine that 18 to 30 year olds are the second-largest voting
bloc behind seniors, and imagine that they voted in the same
numbers that seniors did,'' Moseley said. ``People would listen.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Use facts from the story to complete the following statements:
	   1. The state of Arizona sends 18-year-olds -
	   a) ballot boxes.
	   b) notices about midterm elections.
	   c) birthday cards.
	   2. The birthday messages are from the -
	   a) Secretary of State's office.
	   b) Rock the Boat organization.
	   c) both a and b are correct.
	   3. Young voters receive a letter reminding them to -
	   a) cast their ballots before Nov. 3.
	   b) register to vote.
	   c) run for office.
	   4. As of now, only two states -
	   a) hold general elections.
	   b) allow 18-year-olds to vote.
	   c) send birthday cards to promote voting.
	   5. According to the story, Arizona will -

	   NADOR, Morocco (AP) _ A chartered airliner crashed into a
northern Moroccan mountain Friday, killing all 38 people aboard in
the worst accident involving a Spanish airline in 13 years.
	   After some 10 hours of searches by rescue teams from Spain and
Morocco, the bodies of all the victims were recovered, said Spanish
police chief Juan Cotino, who flew to the scene.
	   The airplane was carrying 34 passengers and four crew members
from the southern Spanish port of Malaga to Melilla, a Spanish
enclave on Morocco's Mediterranean coast.
	   The Pauknair airliner went down in a rugged mountain area less
than a mile (one kilometer) from the coast and just two miles (3
kilometers) north of Melilla as it approached for landing.
	   The cause of the accident was not known, although visibility at
the airport was said to be poor.
	   ``It appears the plane crashed into a hilltop and broke into
pieces,'' said Melilla's regional government chief, Enrique
Palacios, who is also the city's mayor.
	   Cotino said many of the bodies were badly dismembered and
burned, hampering identification.
	   Two of the passengers were Moroccan while the rest were Spanish,
rescue workers said.
	   The 86-seat, British-built BAE 146 belonged to the Spanish
charter airline Pauknair, which specializes in flights between
Melilla and cities in Spain. The airline runs 55 of the 30-minute
flights between Melilla and Malaga each week.
	   In a statement, Pauknair said the company was deeply affected by
the crash and wished to express condolences to the families of
victims.
	   The wreckage of the plane was spotted by a Spanish air force
plane carrying out maneuvers on Friday.
	   It was the first serious air crash involving a Spanish airline
in 13 years. In 1985, a Madrid-bound Boeing 727 of the state
carrier Iberia hit a television antenna on top of a hill in the
northern city of Bilbao, killing 148 people.
	   The world's deadliest aviation disaster occurred on March 27,
1977, in Spain's Canary Islands. A KLM jetliner crashed into a Pan
American jumbo jet on the runway of Tenerife airport, killing 585
people.

Sudanese army claims it killed hundreds of rebels, Ugandan troops
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MOHAMED OSMAN &QC;

<TEXT>
	   JUBA, Sudan (AP) _ The Sudanese army killed 400 rebels and 50
Ugandan troops in battles near a strategic garrison town over the
past two weeks, a military commander in southern Sudan said Friday.
	   The claim was the latest by Sudan that Uganda had sent troops to
fight with southern Sudanese rebels involved in a 15-year civil war
_ an accusation Uganda has repeatedly denied.
	   The commander, Adam Hamid Moussa, said Sudanese troops counted
the Ugandans ``one by one.''
	   Uganda borders Sudan in the south, and each country has accused
the other of supporting rebels within its borders.
	   The most recent Sudanese charges come amid an upsurge in
fighting in southern Sudan, particularly in Equatoria province,
where the garrison town of Juba is located.
	   The Sudan People's Liberation Army, which is seeking autonomy
for the south's Christians and adherents of tribal faiths from the
Muslim, Arabized north, has long seen Juba as crucial.
	   The government brought journalists Friday from the Sudanese
capital of Khartoum to Juba, where life appeared normal in the
city. Planes supplying the city regularly arrived at the airport.
	   Moussa, the commander, said Sudanese forces have scored big
victories against the rebels and Ugandans over the past two weeks,
destroying 15 tanks and seizing ammunition, equipment and supplies.
	   The Sudanese officials did not provide numbers of casualties but
described their losses as insignificant.
	   There was no immediate rebel comment. But earlier this month,
the SPLA claimed it had captured the town of Liria, near Juba.

Bosnian Serb nationalist wins presidency

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A Bosnian Serb hard-liner
was elected president of the Serb-run part of Bosnia-Herzegovina
during national elections two weeks ago, the international
organizers confirmed Friday.
	   Ultranationalist Nikola Poplasen defeated the U.S.-backed
incumbent, Biljana Plavsic, by 38,000 votes, the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe annnounced.
	   OSCE said overall, the results of the Sept. 12-13 general
elections were encouraging because moderates who support the 1995
Dayton peace agreement showed significant gains in other races,
including the Bosnian Serb assembly.
	   But Poplasen's surprise victory clearly raises questions about
the effectiveness of international efforts to build ethnic
tolerance in this Balkan country in the wake of the 3 1-2 -year war
which ended with the Dayton accords.
	   Poplasen has said he will support Dayton, a key condition for
continued Western aid. But Poplasen, a wartime paramilitary leader,
claims Dayton never envisioned the same kind of unitary state for
Bosnia's Serbs, Croats and Muslims as the Americans and Western
Europeans insist it does.
	   OSCE said the results were still unofficial, pending
certification by an electoral commission. Until that happens, the
OSCE will not announce the breakdown of seats in the national
parliament and regional assemblies.
	   But OSCE officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
moderate opposition parties picked up four additional seats in the
Bosnian Serb National Assembly, giving them a majority of 48 seats.
	   That could prevent Poplasen from installing a hard-liner as
prime minister.
	   In Banja Luka, however, Poplasen hailed the victory, saying it
``reflects a consistency of the electoral will'' of the Bosnian
Serbs. He promised to work with the international community to
overcome differences in interpretation of the Dayton agreement.
	   Election officials delayed announcement of the results for
nearly two weeks, citing unspecified ``technical problems'' and a
complicated ballot.
	   The elections were the third in Bosnia since the end of the war.
The peace agreement divided the former Yugoslav republic into a
Serb republic and a Muslim-Croat federation.
	   In other races, the pro-Western Serb candidate for the
three-member joint national presidency, Zivko Radisic, defeated
hard-line incumbent Momcilo Krajisnik by 45,000 votes. Krajisnik
was seen as one of the biggest obstacles to the work of joint
Bosnian institutions.
	   In the 15-seat Lower House of the Bosnian joint parliament, the
pro-Plavsic coalition appears to have won at least two of five Serb
seats. Previously Serb hard-liners held all five seats.
	   Muslim wartime leader and current chairman of the joint
presidency, Alija Izetbegovic, won re-election by more than 450,000
votes.
	   But in the race for the Croat seat on the presidency, the
Western-backed candidate, Kresimir Zubak, lost to hard-liner Ante
Jelavic, who is close to the president of neighboring Croatia,
Franjo Tudjman.
	   Robert Barry, head of the OSCE office in Sarajevo, dismissed
concerns over Poplasen's victory, saying people are paying ``too
much attention'' to the Bosnian Serb presidential race.
	   ``Other races show that the overall trends that we have been
working for, are taking place,'' Barry said.

Nikola Poplasen: Bosnian Serb ultranationalist turned president

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The newly elected Bosnian
Serb president embodies everything the West opposes for the
country.
	   Nikola Poplasen heads the most extreme nationalist party in the
Serb-run half of Bosnia. He was a paramilitary commander during the
war and is a supporter of war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic.
	   On Friday, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe confirmed Poplasen defeated U.S.-backed Biljana Plavsic for
president of the Bosnian Serb republic during nationwide balloting
Sept. 12-13.
	   Poplasen's victory dealt a humiliating blow to international
efforts to cement peace, restart ethnic tolerance and impose
democracy in Bosnia since the Dayton agreement ended the war.
	   A large picture of Poplasen in uniform with a machine gun adorns
the entrance to his Banja Luka office.
	   But the 47-year-old, with a pale, drawn face and pale green
eyes, resembles only a shadow of the fierce image he conveyed as a
paramilitary Serb commander. The slender Poplasen now looks more
like a political science professor, his pre-war job.
	   ``I ended up in politics due to circumstance and not by personal
choice,'' Poplasen likes to say of himself.
	   Born in the north of neighboring Serbia, Poplasen came to Bosnia
to study sociology at Sarajevo University, where he later taught.
	   The early days of the war saw the beginning of Poplasen's
political career, which launched him into the top ranks of
Karadzic's advisers.
	   In 1993, Poplasen settled in Banja Luka, the largest
Serb-controlled city in Bosnia, with his wife and their three
children. The same year, he joined the Serb Radical Party.
	   Aware that his war-time biography counts heavily against him in
the eyes of Western officials, Poplasen recently pledged to
cooperate with the 1995 U.S.-sponsored Dayton peace agreement.
	   ``The Dayton peace agreement will be implemented to the letter,
nothing more and nothing less,'' he told The Associated Press.
	   But Poplasen has said Dayton never envisioned the joint life for
Bosnia's Serbs, Croats and Muslims in a single state.
	   The top U.S. official for the Balkans puts more stock in
Poplasen's war-time behavior than in his promises of cooperation.
	   ``Based on the past, I would be misleading you if I did not tell
you we have the most serious questions'' about Poplasen, Robert
Gelbard said.

European finance chiefs downplay threat from world turmoil
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: RECASTS and UPDATES thruout with fresh quotes, details.
Trims. &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ European finance ministers downplayed
fears that the spreading global economic turmoil threatens to
derail growth within the region as it prepares to launch its single
currency next year.
	   ``Europe has become an anchor of financial stability,'' Austrian
Finance Minister Rudolf Edlinger said Friday as a two-day meeting
of finance ministers and central bank governors from European Union
nations got under way. ``We expect dynamic economic growth in
1999.''
	   Edlinger's optimism was echoed by other officials at the meeting
despite signs that the worldwide financial turbulence is beginning
to take some of the shine off Europe's economic recovery.
	   Italy forecast its economy will grow just 1.8 percent this year
instead of the 2.5 percent forecast last spring. Chancellor Helmut
Kohl on Thursday revised Germany's growth projection to ``around
2.5 percent'' compared to an earlier forecast of 3 percent.
	   However, EU officials said confidence in the strength of the
coming European currency, the euro, and sound policies producing
low inflation and falling budget deficits would shield Europe from
the worst of the global crisis.
	   ``It wouldn't be right to be overly pessimistic in light of the
global environment and to assume that we will see a global
recession,'' German central bank president Hans Tietmeyer said
before the meeting.
	   The talks Saturday, to be held amid the Rococo splendor of the
Hofburg Imperial Palace, were expected to focus on the Russian
crisis. The officials will be joined by Michel Camdessus, managing
director of the International Monetary Fund, which is holding back
payment of the next installments of a dlrs 22.6 billion loan
package until it is satisfied Russia has sound economic policies.
	   There was little sign the EU was willing to push for more money
for Moscow.
	   ``The EU can do everything in its power to stop Russia feeling
isolated,'' said German Economics Minister Guenther Rexrodt. ``What
we cannot do is give fresh cash.''
	   Less than 100 days away from the launch of the euro on Jan. 1 as
the shared currency of 11 EU nations, the ministers appeared to
make little progress on the final preparations.
	   They shied away from setting a deadline for balancing their
budgets, and big and small EU members remained divided over how the
euro-zone would be represented in international organizations such
as the IMF or the G-7 group of world economic powers.

votes.
	   But in the race for the Croat seat on the presidency, the
Western-backed candidate, Kresimir Zubak, lost to hard-liner Ante
Jelavic, who is close to the president of neighboring Croatia,
Franjo Tudjman.
	   Robert Barry, head of the OSCE office in Sarajevo, dismissed
concerns over Poplasen's victory, saying people are paying ``too
much attention'' to the Bosnian Serb presidential race.
	   ``Other races show that the overall trends that we have been
working for, are taking place,'' Barry said.

U.S. Embassy in Liberia airlifts former warlord away

	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ The United States airlifted former
warlord and now fugitive Roosevelt Johnson out of Liberia on Friday
to end a week-old standoff that began when he sought refuge inside
the American Embassy.
	   One helicopter swooped down on a small landing pad at the back
of the sprawling embassy compound, picked up Johnson and a handful
of his supporters and ferried them away amid tight security. A
second helicopter arrived minutes later to pick the rest of the
evacuees.
	   A total of 28 people were flown out Friday, including two of
Johnson's sons and two close aides. The flights also included 23
Johnson supporters who sneaked into the embassy grounds last week
during a government operation to arrest the former warlord.
	   Johnson was flown to a West African peacekeeping force base in
Freetown, Sierra Leone, U.S. embassy officials said.
	   The Pentagon said that peacekeeping force, known as ECOMOG,
provided the helicopters for the airlift.
	   According to local newspaper reports, Johnson will either go
from Sierra Leone onward to Ghana or Nigeria. Quoting local
government officials, the newspaper reports also said an agreement
to allow Johnson to leave stipulated that he would be tried in
absentia and would be returned to Liberia if found guilty.
	   The move to evacuate Johnson from Liberia came after days of
talks between U.S. officials in Washington and President Charles
Taylor's government.
	   Taylor had urged the United States to hand Johnson over to the
government, but the president's spokesman said Thursday there would
be no effort to block Johnson's evacuation.
	   Johnson, Taylor's main rival, had been holed up in the embassy
in the capital, Monrovia, for a week. Liberian soldiers apparently
fired on his group as they were trying to arrange for refuge at the
seaside compound.
	   Fearing another round of fighting, security had been greatly
increased at the embassy and most diplomats were evacuated. U.S.
military reinforcements were sent in to help shore up the embassy's
defenses.
	   At least three of Johnson's supporters were killed in the
shooting and two Americans were injured.
	   After the nearly week-long standoff, obviously relieved embassy
staff were pleased with Johnson's departure.
	   ``I'm glad this is over,'' said Deputy Chief of Mission John
Bauman, during an interview in his office, his flak jacket flung
over his chair.
	   Still, security remained tight at the embassy and officials said
even more American troops would be flown in shortly in case of
further violence.
	   Longtime rivals Taylor and Johnson headed opposing factions
during Liberia's seven-year civil war, which ended in 1996.
	   While the two men ostensibly made peace after Taylor was elected
president last year, Johnson's supporters and government soldiers
have repeatedly clashed over the past few months.
	   On Friday, while Johnson was flown away from his country, Taylor
was again declaring victory.
	   ``It is not my victory, it is not your victory, it is not the
victory of the security forces, it is the lord's victory,'' Taylor
told a gathering of church choirs on Friday.
	   Taylor's spokesman Reginald Goodridge said he hoped the United
States would cooperate with Liberia in bringing Johnson to trial on
charges of treason.
	   Johnson's group forced their way through an embassy gate during
the shooting. Although the U.S. Embassy did not want Johnson in the
compound, it has been forced to protect him.
	   American officials, who say Johnson will not be handed over to
the Liberian government, earlier indicated a resolution to the
standoff would involve flying Johnson to a neutral country.
	   U.S. officials say they are concerned Johnson would not receive
a fair trial in Liberia _ as indicated by the use of force against
his reportedly unarmed group in front of the embassy last week.
	   Goodridge has insisted Johnson will be treated justly, saying
that representatives from the United States, international
organizations and human rights groups would be invited to monitor
the proceedings.
	   The latest crisis with Johnson began Sept. 18 when Liberian
troops tried to arrest the former rebel leader. Gun, rocket and
mortar battles erupted in the capital and spilled over toward the
U.S. Embassy compound, eyewitnesses had said. At least 47 people
were killed in the weekend fighting though aid agencies say as many
as 350 people could have been killed.

Taylor wins sixth-round decision
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WOLLONGONG, Australia (AP) _ Australian Shannan Taylor won the
Oriental and Pacific Boxing Federation weltwerweight title Friday
in unusual circumstances with a sixth-round technical decision over
defending champion Sukh Yun Yum of South Korea at Wollongong
Entertainment Center.
	   A cut near the top of Taylor's forehead caused by an accidental
head clash prompted fight doctor Alex Lewis to advise referee Billy
Males to halt the fight in the sixth round and call for the judges'
scorecards.
	   Australian official Don Marks had Taylor ahead 59-55 and New
Zealand judge scored the fight 59-54 to the local boxer. South
Korean official Wan Soo Yuh had the visiting fighter leading 58-57
when the bout was stopped.
	   The victory for Taylor, the sixth-ranked World Boxing Council
welterweight, improved his record to 22 wins _ 16 by knockout _ and
one draw. The Korean's record slipped to 19 wins and 10 losses.
	   Taylor weighed in at 66.5 kilograms (146.3 pounds) while his
opponent was 66.45 (146.1). (djp)

Brilliant Bordeaux thumps Rennes; Nantes overcomes nine-man Lens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Bordeaux swept to its sixth win in seven games
Friday, beating Rennes 4-0 to extend its lead at the top of the
first division to four points.
	   In the seventh round of the championship, Lyon drew 0-0 at Nancy
to move second, level with Marseille, a 2-0 winner at Bastia on
Thursday.
	   Bordeaux had little trouble disposing of Rennes to maintain its
outstanding start to the season.
	   Striker Lilian Laslandes pressed his claim for a place in the
French team in the 11th minute, profiting from lacklustre Rennes
defending to score from seven meters (yards).
	   Silvain Wiltord, another in-form Bordeaux striker, made the
second in the 28th minute, carving open the visitors' defense
before passing to 21-year-old Congolese midfielder Kiki Musampa,
who scored his first of the season.
	   Musampa turned provider early in the second half, dribbling
superbly on the right and finding David Jemmali who, unmarked, made
no mistake from close range.
	   Wiltord completed the rout in the 58th minute with a fine
15-meter (yard) strike, his seventh goal of the season.
	   Lyon drew 0-0 at Nancy.
	   Nancy came closest, when Marc Zanotti shot just wide of the post
when well-placed early in the match.
	   In an incredible match at the Felix-Bollaert stadium, Lens had
two men sent off as it fought back from 2-0 down against Nantes,
before conceding two late goals to lose 4-2.
	   Lens, which visits Dynamo Kiev in the champions league
Wednesday, got off to a disasterous start when Eric Sikora was sent
off in the 13th minute for handball in the penalty area.
	   Christophe Leroux converted from the spot for the Canaries.
	   Nantes doubled its lead in the 31st minute when Nicolas Gillet
headed in from a corner.
	   Tony Vairailles pulled one back just before the break, but Lens'
cause looked hopeless when Cyril Rool was sent off early in the
second half.
	   Vairailles stunned Nantes by equalizing soon after.
	   But Nicolas Savinaud scored again for the visitors as Nantes won
to climb to fifth place.
	   Monaco moved to fourth with a 3-0 win at home to lowly Le Havre.
	   The 1997 champion opened the scoring in the 24th minute when
Robert Spehar played a defense-splitting pass to David Trezeguet,
who fired in from the right of the penalty area.
	   Victor Ikpeba made it 2-0 in the 52nd minute before Trezeguet
scored from the penalty spot late on.
	   Paris Saint-Germain's miserable start to the season continued
with a 1-0 loss at Sochaux, which began the game in last place.
	   Big-spending PSG went down even though Sochaux defender Eric
Boniface was sent off for a dangerous tackle early in the 22nd
minute.
	   Sebastien Dallet scored the winner after a comical error by PSG
goalkeeper Bernard Lama.
	   In other matches Friday: Lorient 1, Metz 1; Strasbourg 2,
Montpellier 1.

Government vows to find way to keep its history in computer age
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE FEINSILBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Twelve years after declaring that the country
is ``in danger of losing its memory,'' the government is promising
to find a way to preserve millions of computer-generated records
that can be made unreadable by obsolescence.
	   But in court papers filed this week, National Archivist John W.
Carlin said he cannot meet a Wednesday deadline for formulating new
directions on how agencies can decide which computer records must
be preserved and which can be deleted. He asked for more time.
	   And Carlin, the government's chief record keeper, said the
predicament must take a back seat to an even more urgent matter _
the year 2000 computer problem.
	   That's ``a deadline that cannot be put off,'' he said, and
agencies don't have the resources to deal with both simultaneously.
	   ``They're stalling,'' said Michael Tankersley, a lawyer
representing historians, researchers, librarians and journalists.
They sued the archives in 1996 to block a Carlin directive that
would have allowed agencies to destroy e-mail and other electronic
records as long as they kept a final version on paper.
	   ``We're going to oppose it,'' Tankersley said of Carlin's
request for more time. ``This is a totally unjustified stall to
cover the fact that they haven't done anything for the past 11
months.''
	   Last October, siding with the researchers, U.S. District Judge
Paul L. Friedman declared Carlin's directive null and void.
	   Friedman brushed aside the argument of government lawyers that
``many government computer applications will come to a halt or
crash entirely'' if all records must be saved until a solution can
be found.
	   He said Carlin had ``abdicated'' his responsibility ``to ensure
that records with administrative, legal, research or other value
are preserved.''
	   In April, when the researchers said the archives had made little
progress, Friedman set his Wednesday deadline. If the archives did
not come up with new regulations by then, he said, a ``no delete''
policy would go into place, with agencies forbidden from destroying
any computer files.
	   But that, Carlin said in the court papers, ``will cause the
government's office automation systems to shut down in the near
future.''
	   In a separate policy statement, the archivist accepted the
urgency of finding a solution, calling the problem ``the biggest
challenge ever to recordkeeping in the federal government and
elsewhere.'' The alternative it ``is irretrievable information,
unverifiable documentation, diminished government accountability
and lost history,'' he said.
	   It has been estimated that in a few years 90 percent of the
government's paperwork will be done on computers, making the
storage problem ever more severe.
	   Computer tapes deteriorate and both machines and software become
obsolete, with government left with no computers on which records
can be read. The government uses hundreds of different computer
systems. Thus the archives must find ways that computer records can
be preserved and read on new machines still to be developed.

Dow shakes off losses; European and Asian markets fall
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with close of Dow, gain for week, and Dow's difference
from the start of the year and its July record high. &QL; 
 &UR; By BRUCE MEYERSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks bounced back from steep early losses on
Wall Street and finished above the day's lows in Europe Friday, but
traders remained skittish about the growing damage from economic
crises in Asia and Russia.
	   Investors worldwide were unnerved this week by the dlrs 3.5
billion private bailout of a major hedge fund. Adding to the
anxiety was the disclosure from United Bank of Switzerland that
market turmoil, including investments in the hedge fund, had left
it with huge losses this quarter. There are worries about where the
next flashpoint would emerge.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, which fell 152.42 on Thursday,
dropped an additional 112 points in the early going Friday, but
recovered to close with a gain of 26.78 at 8,028.77. That left the
Dow with a gain of 133.11 points for the week.
	   Broader market indicators also bounced back from an early
setback as bargain-hunters returned to the market. Trading was
active but slower than Thursday's pace.
	   The early selling had threatened to wipe out the 257.21-point
surge by the Dow on Wednesday, when Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan signaled interest rate cuts are likely.
	   Even with the gain, the Dow remained 14 percent, or 1,309.20
points, below the July 17 record of 9,337.97. But it is up 1.5
percent, or 120.52 points, from where it began the year, at
7,908.25.

kidnapping &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Singing superstar Vicente Fernandez says the
kidnapping of his eldest son will not drive him from his native
Mexico.
	   Vicente Fernandez Jr., 34, was released earlier this month after
the 4-month-long ordeal, reportedly for a dlrs 3.2 million ranson.
The kidnappers cut off two of his fingers.
	   The elder Fernandez, whose mariachi-backed ``ranchero'' songs
have made him one of the biggest stars in Mexico and the American
Southwest, spoke for the first time about the crime Thursday on the
Televisa network.
	   ``I will not leave Mexico. If I sing ranchero, I will live my
whole life in Mexico. I want that to be clear. From my country,
they will only take me out feet first,'' Fernandez said.
	   Of the kidnappers, he said: ``May God forgive them _ and
hopefully I'll never find out who they were.''

Church, authorities question right of 10-year-old rape victim to
</HEADLINE>
have abortion &QL; 
 &UR; By STAN LEHMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ The right of a pregnant 10-year-old
rape victim to have an abortion has pitted a judge against the
church in a small rural town in central Brazil.
	   On one side is Judge Joao Geraldo Machado, who on Sept. 16
authorized the abortion because the law allows the procedures in
cases of rape or if childbirth threatens a mother's life.
	   On the other side is Roman Catholic Church officials and state
attorney Reuder Cavalvante Motta who invoke an unborn child's right
to life.
	   In the middle is the victim _ who is 4-months pregnant _ and her
parents, poor rural workers in Israelandia, about 900 kilometers
(560 miles) northwest of Sao Paulo in the state of Goias.
	   Two neighbors have been arrested and charged with repeatedly
raping the girl over the past three years, Machado said. The two
face jail sentences of up to 10 years.
	   Citing an eyewitness, Machado said the two men ``offered food,
candy and crackers to the girl to lure her into a house where they
raped her.''
	   The eyewitness is an 11-year-old girl the two men forced to
guard the house.
	   ``I am normally opposed to abortion,'' Machado said. ``But in
this case I am in favor of it. The law allows it and I think the
girl's welfare depends on it.''
	   State attorney Motta doesn't agree.
	   ``The constitution guarantees the right to life, including
intrauterine life,'' Motta said. ``And I don't think the girl's
health or welfare will be affected if she gives birth.''
	   The Goias state court of appeals suspended the abortion that had
been scheduled for Wednesday, and is expected to rule on the case
next week.
	   Meanwhile, local church officials are trying to convince the
girl and her parents to keep the child.
	   The Rev. Luiz Carlos Loddi said the church would donate food,
clothing and ``everything else the child may need.''
	   The girl's father, Manoel Batista de Souza told the Diario da
Manha newspaper he favored the abortion ``because I fear for my
daughter's life.''
	   ``I fear the wrath of God, but we'll go through with the
abortion if the court says we can.''

Trainer feels Lewis is no-win situation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ED SCHUYLER JR. &QC; 
 &UR; AP Boxing Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNCASVILLE, Connecticut (AP) _ Trainer Emanuel Steward doesn't
think any heavyweight can beat Lennox Lewis. Yet he wishes the WBC
champion wasn't fighting Zeljko Mavrovic.
	   ``Stylewise this is the worst fight for Lennox,'' Steward said.
``Mavrovic is a very technical fighter.''
	   It's the kind of style that can make an opponent look bad. And
Steward is concerned that if the power-punching Lewis is taken the
full 12 rounds Saturday night against the relatively unknown
Croatian, he will be criticized for not scoring a knockout.
	   On the other hand, Steward said, ``If Lennox wins very early,
people will say, `Who did he beat.'''
	   Lewis agrees.
	   ``If I knock him out in five rounds, that's what they expect,''
the 33-year-old from Britain said. ``If it goes the distance,
they'll say, `What's going on here?'''
	   The unbeaten Mavrovic is not an opponent of choice. Lewis is
making a mandatory defense against the WBC's No. 1-ranked
contender.
	   The fight at the 5,000-seat tent at Mohegan Sun Casino will be
televised by HBO.
	   Mavrovic, the 29-year-old European champion, has fought only
four times in the United States and not since 1995. He has a record
of 27-0, with 22 knockouts, against mediocre opposition.
	   He has scored five straight technical knockouts dating to a
12-round decision over Christopher Bizot in defense of the European
title April 26, 1996, in Germany.
	   Another minus for Mavrovic could be that he hasn't fought since
Oct. 18. Lewis has fought twice since Oct. 4, and those two fights
lasted less than six full rounds. But fighting is what keeps a
boxer in fighting shape.
	   While Mavrovic has an impressive knockout record, Lewis does not
expect him to engage in a slugfest.
	   ``He's got good foot and hand speed and is a straight-up
boxer,'' Lewis said. ``He's a runner.''
	   It should be remembered, however, that Shannon Briggs, not a
real big puncher, had Lewis reeling about the ring in the first
round before Lewis stopped him in the fifth round March 28.
	   The only loss on Lewis' 33-1 record, with 27 knockouts, came
when he got caught with hands low and was knocked down and stopped
in the second round by Oliver McCall on Sept. 24, 1994.
	   ``My main goal is not to allow him to capitalize on any mistakes
I make,'' said the 6-foot-5 (2.88-meter) Lewis, who weighed in
Friday at 243 pounds (109.4 kilograms). Mavrovic, 6-4 (2.84-meter),
weighed 214 1-4 pounds (96.5 kilograms).
	   Lewis weighed 244 pounds (110 kilograms) he stopped Andrew
Golota in the first round last Nov. 4, and he weighed 228 pounds
(102 kilograms) when he stopped Briggs in the fifth round March 28.
Mavrovic weighed 220 pounds (99 kilograms) for his last fight Oct.
18 when he stopped Vicenzo Cantatore in the fourth round. The last
time he was lighter than 214 1-4 pounds (96.4 kilograms) was when
he weighed 214 pounds (96.3 kilograms) in April 1995.
	   A victory would pave the way for Lewis for a unification fight
with Evander Holyfield, the IBF-WBA champion. But first, Holyfield
is expected to make a WBA mandatory defense against Henry
Akinwande. He made an IBF mandatory defense last Saturday night,
outpointing Vaughn Bean.

Americans, Gambill lose first set
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) _ Italy's Andrea Gaudenzi defeated American
Jan-Michael Gambill in the opening match of their Davis Cup
semifinal this afternoon.
	   Gambill fell in his Davis Cup debut, losing in four sets, the
last two tiebreakers. Gaudenzi won 6-2, 0-6, 7-6 (7-0), 7-6 (7-4)
at the Milwaukee Center Arena.
	   Gambill, who has risen from No. 227 to 50th in the world
rankings after reaching the third round of the U.S. Open _ losing
to French Open champion Carlos Moya in a fifth-set tiebreaker _
took Jim Courier's place in the draw. Courier is out because of
muscle fatigue in his right arm.
	   Gambill, who hits two-fisted from both the backhand and forehand
sides, survived eight match points before succumbing in the second
of the tiebreakers.
	   Todd Martin, the veteran American in Courier's absence, played
Davide Sanguinetti in the other singles match on Day 1. They swap
opponents Sunday after Martin and Davis Cup rookie Justin Gimelstob
take on Gaudenzi and Diego Nargiso in Saturday's doubles match.

Spain expects 3.8 P.C. growth in 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish government released details of
its 1999 budget Friday with Finance Minister Rodrigo Rato
predicting growth of 3.8 percent.
	   Rato said the budget is targeting year-end inflation at 1.8
percent and a year-end budget deficit of 1.6 percent of national
output. He also cut the 1998 budget deficit target to 2.1 percent
from 2.2 percent.
	   The minister is due to release the full break-down of the budget
on Tuesday, when the package is presented to parliament which must
approve or reject it by Dec. 31.
	   The government's forecasts are more optimistic than those of the
European Union Commission, which see Spain's year-end 1999 GDP at
3.7 percent, its deficit as a percentage of GDP at 1.9 percent and
inflation at 2.2 percent.

Rushdie emerges from life in shadows

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ No longer in fear of an Iranian death sentence,
Salman Rushdie said Friday he did not regret writing ``The Satanic
Verses,'' the book that drew the wrath of Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini.
	   ``I've had 10 years of my life deformed by this,'' he said.
``I've had friends of mine threatened, had my family messed about,
had people that I care about shot and killed. I could ask for an
apology, but I'm not doing so.''
	   ``The world has just changed,'' he added at a news conference.
``Let's get on with our lives.''
	   The 51-year-old writer spoke eloquently and with obvious relief
at Iran's announcement Thursday that it would distance itself from
a dlrs 2.5 million reward for his death.
	   Since the late Iranian leader announced his ``fatwa'' Feb. 14,
1989, claiming ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemed Islam, Rushdie has
spent nearly a decade in hiding, under police protection.
	   His ordeal in the shadows began with ``shock and grief'' over
the initial news reports.
	   ``It's an extraordinary thing to see people walking down the
streets of a foreign city carrying your picture with the eyes poked
out and calling for your death,'' he said. ``Everything you think
about everything suddenly ceases to be true.''
	   He said there have been repeated threats against his life but
``Nobody got very close.''
	   In 1991, a Japanese translator of the book was stabbed to death
and the Italian translator survived a knife attack. In 1993, the
book's Norwegian publisher was shot three times and survived.
	   At least 45 people were killed in early riots about the book.
	   Thanking his supporters, he said the fight against the death
sentence was a battle worth fighting, not just for his life, ``but
because it represented many of the things in this world we most
cared about.''
	   ``The freedom of the imagination, the great overarching issue of
freedom of speech, the right of human beings to walk down the
streets of their own country without fear. These have been colossal
matters,'' he said.
	   Rushdie, who has a grown son from his first marriage, had been
married to writer Marianne Wiggins when the fatwa was announced.
Six months later they separated, divorcing in 1993. When he
remarried in 1997, his bride was identified only as ``Elizabeth''
to protect her safety. They have since had a son.
	   Although Muslims have said the fatwa cannot be lifted formally,
the Iranian decision eases the threat to Rushdie.
	   ``I feel there is a small, continued need for caution,'' Rushdie
said. But it was for the kind of threat that many prominent people
face in the modern world and ``this can be dealt with without the
colossal apparatus of state protection.''
	   The writer confessed Friday that a low point in an extraordinary
decade was when he falsely claimed publicly to have ``embraced
Islam.''
	   ``I am not a religious person and I shouldn't have said I was,''
said Rushdie, who was born in India and raised in a Muslim family.
	   ``The Satanic Verses'' has sold more than 1 million copies in
English, has been translated into 15 languages and banned in more
than 20 countries.
	   Rushdie said he had no regrets about writing the book.
	   ``'The Satanic Verses' is as important in my body of work as any
of my other books. I cannot imagine my body of work without it
there, in the sense that I am content with the book that I wrote,''
he said.
	   Asked Friday how he would react to continued requests that it be
withdrawn from sale, he replied, ``There is not a chance in hell of
the book being withdrawn ... `The Satanic Verses' is as important
in my body of work as any of my other books.''
	   He expressed sorrow for the people killed in demonstrations
against the book, particularly in India. '' ... I feel in many
cases they did not even know what they were demonstrating
against.''
	   Now he intends to write about his ordeal.
	   ``It's a very hot story and most of you don't know it. I look
forward to telling it,'' he said. ``I always felt the time to write
about it was when I knew what the last chapter was.''

Top officials quit over appointment of new finance minister

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's top economic official quit his job in
anger Friday, and the new government got some bad news from the
International Monetary Fund: no new loan installments this month.
	   Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime minister in charge of
economic policy, quit after President Boris Yeltsin announced the
appointment of a holdover finance minister who served in the
previous two administrations.
	   Shokhin said the minister, Mikhail Zadornov, might know finance,
but ``his professionalism has not been confirmed in the past
month,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov lashed out at Shokhin for his
``whimsical demarche,'' and said he was acting irresponsibly during
a time of crisis.
	   Another top financial official, Dmitry Vasilyev, head of the
market watchdog Federal Securities Commission, also resigned in
protest against Zadornov's appointment.
	   Zadornov, a 35-year-old economist, is considered one of the only
members of the new Cabinet who is fully committed to
market-oriented economic reforms.
	   However, he carries the baggage of the economic team that
presided over Russia's decision to devalue the ruble and
effectively default on its loans last month.
	   Shokhin said he doesn't intend to remain as a ``fig leaf'' for
international investors when the Russian government is ``occupied
by people who have already deceived investors once.''
	   Zadornov comes from the ranks of Russia's more liberal
economists, who trying to solve the nation's economic problems by
printing more rubles, and who saw no alternative to letting the
ruble's value float freely.
	   Shokhin, however, has favored the controlled introduction of new
rubles. He also criticized the previous government, which included
Zadornov, for letting the ruble be devalued and for its plans to
restructure Russia's foreign debt.

Chavez asks for protection of his sons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Former world champion Julio Cesar Chavez has
asked police to protect his three sons after the family received
written threats warning that the boys would be kidnapped, newspaper
reports said Friday.
	   Chavez and his wife, Amalia Carrasco, want Civil Protection
authorities in Sinaloa state to assign a private security guard for
the young boys. Authorities said they were studying the request.
	   Chavez said his family has received similar threats in the past.
	   ``Right now, crime and kidnapping are very serious,'' he said,
pointing to the 4-month-long kidnapping of the adult son of famed
Mexican singer Vicente Fernandez, which ended this month. ``The
only thing I want is security for my sons and for me.''
	   Chavez and his wife, who have filed for divorce, are in a bitter
custody struggle over the children. Though a judicial order allows
the fighter to have his sons only on weekends, Chavez wants to keep
them because he believes he can better protect their security.
	   In his last fight, Chavez sustained a bruising and bloody loss
to WBC welterweight champion Oscar de la Hoya Sept. 19. He since
has asked the WBC for a chance to fight for the super lightweight
title.

	   NADOR, Morocco (AP) _ A chartered airliner crashed into a
northern Moroccan mountain Friday, killing all 38 people aboard in
the worst accident involving a Spanish airline in 13 years.
	   After some 10 hours of searches by rescue teams from Spain and
Morocco, the bodies of all the victims were recovered, said Spanish
police chief Juan Cotino, who flew to the scene.
	   The airplane was carrying 34 passengers and four crew members
from the southern Spanish port of Malaga to Melilla, a Spanish
enclave on Morocco's Mediterranean coast.
	   The Pauknair airliner went down in a rugged mountain area less
than a mile (1 kilometer) from the coast and just 25 miles (40
kilometers) north of Melilla as it approached for landing.
	   The cause of the accident was not known, although visibility at
the airport was said to be poor.
	   ``It appears the plane crashed into a hilltop and broke into
pieces,'' said Melilla's regional government chief, Enrique
Palacios, who is also the city's mayor.
	   Cotino said many of the bodies were badly dismembered and
burned, hampering identification.
	   A Spanish Interior Ministry official in Melilla said most of the
victims were Spaniards but four were believed to be Moroccan.

Vietnam says foreign donors should not impose economic remedies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The foreign minister of Vietnam, whose
country is receiving dlrs 2.4 billion this year in foreign aid,
said Friday that donors shouldn't impose blanket economic remedies
that ignore conditions of individual nations.
	   Such moves ``might worsen the critical condition of the patient
and cause social unrest with unforeseen consequences,'' Nguyen Manh
Cam told the U.N. General Assembly.
	   Last year, donor countries and international organizations
pledged dlrs 2.4 billion in aid to Vietnam for 1998, while urging
the country's communist leadership push forward with economic
reforms.
	   Vietnam has been gradually introducing market-oriented reforms
into its command economy since the mid-1980s, when the country was
at a virtual economic standstill and was crippled by triple-digit
inflation.
	   In recent years those reforms have ushered in near 9 percent
annual economic growth.
	   But Vietnam was jolted by the Asian financial crisis, which
leaders estimated wiped out dlrs 500 million in export revenues.
	   ``More than ever, the industrial countries need to actively
assist developing and less developed countries by opening wider
their markets,'' said Cam, who is also deputy prime minister.
	   He said that doomsday scenarios predicting that Asian countries
would never recover from the financial crisis were exaggerated.
	   ``The crisis in Southeast Asia is neither the first nor the last
one which happened in the history of market economy,'' Cam said.
	   ``We are of the firm conviction that Southeast Asia will soon
overcome challenges, re-emerge prosperous, and the international
community will again, as it did, regard this region as a fully
potential partner,'' Cam said.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A Bosnian Serb hard-liner
was elected president of the Serb-run part of Bosnia-Herzegovina
during national elections two weeks ago, the international
organizers confirmed Friday.
	   Ultranationalist Nikola Poplasen defeated the U.S.-backed
incumbent, Biljana Plavsic, by 38,000 votes, the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe annnounced.
	   OSCE said overall, the results of the Sept. 12-13 general
elections were encouraging because moderates who support the 1995
Dayton peace agreement showed significant gains in other races,
including the Bosnian Serb assembly.
	   But Poplasen's surprise victory clearly raises questions about
the effectiveness of international efforts to build ethnic
tolerance in this Balkan country in the wake of the 3 1-2 -year war
which ended with the Dayton accords.
	   Poplasen has said he will support Dayton, a key condition for
continued Western aid. But Poplasen, a wartime paramilitary leader,
claims Dayton never envisioned the same kind of unitary state for
Bosnia's Serbs, Croats and Muslims as the Americans and Western
Europeans insist it does.
	   OSCE said the results were still unofficial, pending
certification by an electoral commission. Until that happens, the
OSCE will not announce the breakdown of seats in the national
parliament and regional assemblies.
	   But OSCE officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
moderate opposition parties picked up four additional seats in the
Bosnian Serb National Assembly, giving them a majority of 48 seats.
	   That could prevent Poplasen from installing a hard-liner as
prime minister.
	   In Banja Luka, however, Poplasen said his victory ``reflects a
consistency of the electoral will'' of the Bosnian Serbs. He
promised to work with the international community to overcome
differences in interpretation of the Dayton agreement.
	   Bosnia's Muslim ambassador to the United Nations, Muhamed
Sacirbey, said Poplasen ``has to be given a chance.''
	   ``We hope he will succeed but it will have to be more than words
this time,'' Sacirbey told CNN-International. ``For quite a few
months, we've been hearing good words coming from some people but
very little substance on the ground, particularly in terms of
return of refugees and for that matter the arrest of those who have
been indicted for war crimes.''
	   Referring to Poplasen, Sacirbey said ``the West needs to put him
to the test and put him to the test immediately.''

Brazil takes 2-0 lead over Romania in Davis Cup

<TEXT>
	   FLORIANOPOLIS, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil chances for staying in the
elite World Group seemed a lot brighter Friday after taking a 2-0
lead over Romania in the first day of Davis Cup play Friday.
	   Both teams need to win if they want to avoid being lowered to
the second division.
	   In the first match of the day, Brazilian Fernando Meligeni, 48th
in the ATP rankings beat Romanian the 67th ranked Andrian Voinea in
straight sets 6-1, 6-4, 7-6 (7-3).
	   In the second match, top ranked Brazilian Gustavo Kuerten (27)
defeated Romanian Andrei Pavel (76), also in straight sets 7-5,
6-3, 6-3.
	   The Brazilian team now needs only one more win to secure their
spot in the elite group.
	   On Saturday, Kuerten and Jaime Oncins should face off against
Pavel and Gabriel Trifu, but the coaches are allowed to change the
make-up of the doubles teams up to 60 minutes before the game.
	   On Sunday, Kuerten will play Voinea and Meligeni faces Pavel.

Bjorkman, Johansson win opening matches to give Sweden 2-0 lead

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with second singles result &QL;

 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Thomas Johansson had a perfect Davis
Cup debut on Friday night, beating fifth-ranked Carlos Moya in
three straight but tough sets to give Sweden a commanding 2-0 lead
in the semifinals against Spain.
	   Johansson, 23, won 7-5, 7-6 (7-4), 7-6 (8-6) before a boisterous
sellout crowd at the Royal Tennis Hall that included former great
Bjorn Borg, who led Sweden to its first Davis Cup title here in
1975. Since then, Sweden has won the world's most prestigious team
tennis event another five times and is now favored to reach its
12th final.
	   Returning to the site where he notched one of his finest
tournament victories in the Stockholm Open a year ago, Jonas
Bjorkman beat Alex Corretja 6-3, 7-5, 6-7 (5-7), 6-3 in the first
singles match.
	   ``I haven't played much better serve-and-volley tennis than
this,'' Bjorkman said. ``I'm extremely happy. It was one of my best
matches in the Davis Cup.
	   ``The match was what I expected it to be. We know that these
guys can play well even on this (fast) surface. But I would have
been glad if the match had been shorter.''
	   The first match lasted 3 hours, 25 minutes. The Swedish No. 1
will be back Saturday for the doubles match with Nicklas Kulti
against veteran Javier Sanchez and Julian Alonso.
	   During the match, Bjorkman broke a nail on his big toe ``but it
should be no problem for the doubles,'' he said.
	   The opener ended with the longest game of the match, Bjorkman
finally clinching it on his fourth match point with a volley into
the open court.
	   Bjorkman's hard-fought victory avenged two straight losses to
the Spaniard on hardcourts, including one in the semifinals of the
Dubai Open early this year.
	   Bjorkman got off to a perfect start as he broke Corretja at love
in the opening game. Corretja broke back to 2-2, but the Swede won
the set after breaking Corretja's serve in the seventh and ninth
games.
	   After trading early breaks in the second set, Bjorkman got his
next chance when Corretja fell behind 0-30 on service in the 10th
game. Corretja clawed back to deuce, only to double fault on
Bjorkman's first set point.
	   Both players held their serve throughout the third set, forcing
a tiebreaker. A double fault when leading 5-4 proved costly for
Bjorkman. The Swede missed his next two shots, giving Corretja the
lead for the first time in the tiebreaker.
	   Ahead 6-5, Corretja clinched the set when Bjorkman's return
sailed long.
	   ``It's difficult to get used to the court,'' said Corretja,
ranked seventh in the world. ``I haven't played indoors in 10
months. And I felt the pressure, playing the first match.''
	   Spain reached two Davis Cup finals in the 1960s, but never won
the competition.
	   With its six victories and five runner-up finishes, Sweden is
the most successful Davis Cup nation in the last two decades.
	   The semifinal is played on a fast Taraflex court at the Royal
Tennis Hall. A similar fast court was used in the Royal Tennis Hall
when Sweden captured the first of six Davis Cup finals in 1975 with
Borg on the team. The United States, shut out by Sweden 5-0 in last
year's final at Goteborg, Sweden, plays Italy in the other
semifinal this weekend in Milwaukee. The Davis Cup final is
scheduled Dec. 4-6.

Other Munich team beats Berlin and maintains second place
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Surprising 1860 Munich put pressure at the top of
the table on more famous cross-town rival Bayern Munich Friday with
a 2-0 victory over Hertha Berlin in the Bundesliga.
	   1860, often overlooked in the Bavarian city shared by the two
teams, picked up its fourth win in six matches and closed to within
two points of Bayern.
	   Bayern Munich, which has steamrolled to five wins to open the
season, plays Saturday against Bremen.
	   1860 stunned Berlin, winner against several top Bundesliga clubs
this season, with quick goals to start each half.
	   Morocco's Abderrahim Ouakili split the Berlin defense in the
second minute on a solo run, while Hendrik Herzog scored an own
goal fighting off striker Bernd Hobsch just 56 minutes into the
second half.
	   ``Our minds stayed in the dressing room a little longer than
1860's,'' said Berlin coach Juergen Rober drily to the fast scores.
	   The win insured that 1860's overachieving players will earn two
days off and a trip to the Oktoberfest underway in the city. Coach
Werner Lorant had threatened to forbid any visits and add extra
training if his charges lost.
	   Berlin, which entered the match in sixth place, has emerged as a
power at home in Olympiastadium, but hasn't won on the road.
	   Hamburg's Andrei Panadic scored in the 83rd minute on a header
to carry his team to a 1-0 home victory against the nine men left
on the field for Hansa Rostock.
	   The visitors had two players sent off for rude fouls.

	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ U.S. and French aid
teams joined overwhelmed Dominican officials Friday in trying to
feed the hungry and thirsty survivors of Hurricane Georges, which
killed more than 300 in the Caribbean.
	   In a broad landscape of flooding north of the capital of Santo
Domingo, villages became islands surrounded by miles of muddy
floodwaters. Victims frantically waved as rescue aircraft flew
overhead.
	   Eight hundred people swarmed around a Dominican air force
helicopter when it tried to land Friday on an island in the town of
Matamomon. Its three-man crew kicked off desperate people trying to
climb aboard and tossed food rations to those screaming on the
ground below.
	   Food and water stocks ran perilously low after Georges struck
here Tuesday, bringing 110 mph (177 kph) winds that destroyed 90
percent of the nation's food crops.
	   ``In the shelters people are hungry, thirsty and in bad
conditions sanitary-wise. The food stocks will be used up pretty
quickly,'' said Rodger Garner, a program officer for the U.S.
Agency for International Development.
	   A U.S. Air Force C-130 cargo plane landed in Santo Domingo with
enough plastic tarpaulins to roof 2,000 houses. Sixty-three search
and rescue firefighters from New York were being flown in, while a
French C-130 also delivered disaster specialists, food and medical
aid.
	   Paul Bell, U.S. AID's regional disaster relief director, said it
was the first of an extensive airlift of food, animal feed and
other aid.
	   Bell warned that people sick with water-borne diseases, such as
dengue fever, ``will overload the hospital system, which was never
very good anyway.''
	   Georges' Caribbean death toll topped 300, with at least 210 dead
in the Dominican Republic, 87 in Haiti, three in Puerto Rico, three
in St. Kitts, two in Antigua and two in Cuba.
	   Georges hit especially hard in Hispaniola, an impoverished
island of 15 million people shared by Haiti and the Dominican
Republic. Substandard housing couldn't stand up to the winds and
flooding. Most deaths were due to flooding.
	   Shelters opened in Santo Domingo only as the storm was hitting
Monday, while in Haiti, the Western Hemisphere's poorest nation,
denuded mountains and unmaintained drainage systems were blamed for
widespread flooding.
	   Santo Domingo newspapers accused the government Friday of
failing to warn the public how dangerous the storm was. ``The
emergency committee hid the severity of Hurricane Georges,'' read
Listin Diario's front-page headline.
	   National Palace spokesman Adriano Miguel Tejada defended the
government's efforts and said everything possible was being done to
help the homeless, estimated at 100,000.
	   Twenty miles (30 kilometers) north of the capital, treetops,
stripped of foliage, poked above the brown, debris-strewn flooding
that was miles wide at some points.
	   Storm victims swam toward their homes to retrieve what they
could. From the air it was clear they would leave empty-handed _
the roofs were gone and nothing but water and mud was inside.
	   In the town of Yabacao, about 150 people stood amid 30 shacks
atop an island the size of a football field. Residents raised their
arms at a helicopter flying above, but the chopper flew past.
	   Outside Santo Domingo, gun-toting guards and several hundred
inmates stood on the roof of the pentagon-shaped La Victoria
prison, most of which was underwater.
	   Throughout the capital, thousands of people stood in block-long
lines for water, and many filled their jugs from the brown,
debris-filled Ozama River.
	   ``There's no water. There's no power. There is nothing,'' said
Domingo Osvaldo Fortuna, 51, as he filled a jug with river water.
Asked whether he was worried about disease, Osvaldo angrily
replied: ``Of course.''
	   In Puerto Rico, officials estimated damage of at least dlrs 2
billion. Crews restored power and water service to some San Juan
neighborhoods, but thousands had to line up in hopes of buying ice
while others waited in the hot sun to fill jugs with water from
government tanker trucks.
	   Under a disaster declaration by President Clinton, Puerto Rico
was getting dlrs 39 million to repair public housing and was
authorized to use $300 million in previously awarded housing aid
for disaster relief.

Chancellor and challenger make final appeal to voters

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl and challenger Gerhard
Schroeder wound up their campaigns Friday running neck and neck in
one of the tightest election races in postwar Germany.
	   Kohl and his Christian Democrats have steadily whittled away at
the early lead enjoyed by the Social Democrats and candidate
Schroeder, and polls now put them virtually even.
	   The Emnid polling institute put the parties within one
percentage point of each other Friday, too close to call: 39
percent for the Christian Democrats, 40 percent for the Social
Democrats.
	   Both candidates closed their campaigns with major rallies Friday
evening _ Kohl in the Rhine River city of Mainz and Schroeder in
Berlin _ in a final push to win over the 24 percent of voters who
remain undecided in the Emnid poll.
	   Before 10,000 supporters in the cathedral square in Mainz, Kohl
insisted the election was a choice about the direction of Germany
would take into the 21st century.
	   ``I hear a lot of applause when I say that there's still a lot
to be done,'' he said. ``But we've also accomplished a lot. There
are blossoming landscapes in Germany.''
	   At an arena in Berlin, Schroeder called Kohl ``the chancellor of
unemployment,'' responsible for record double-digit joblessness. He
told some 8,000 enthusiastic backers that the choice was one of ``a
new start or stagnation.''
	   Both sides appealed to Germans to go to the polls on Sunday and
make their voices heard.
	   ``We need every vote,'' Kohl exhorted his backers.
	   ``It's up to you now,'' Schroeder said before the band struck up
with his campaign's theme song, ``Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now.''
	   After 16 years in office, many voters can hardly remember a
Germany without Kohl as chancellor. Kohl is counting on that
steadfast image _ that of ``the eternal chancellor'' _ to help him
win a record fifth term.
	   Asked during a question-and-answer show Friday on the national
RTL network to describe the ideal chancellor, Kohl quipped: ``One
is sitting right in front of you.''
	   But with the parties so close, it seems most likely that Kohl's
Christian Democrats and Schroeder's Social Democrats will have to
share power in a so-called ``grand coalition,'' something Germany
hasn't seen in almost 30 years.
	   Anything is possible. Even the candidates sound wary.
	   For the first time, Kohl conceded it ``possible'' on Wednesday
that Germany might wind up with a grand coalition _ the first
glimmer that his conservative party might not manage a wide victory
over the center-left opposition.
	   Schroeder has left the door open for a grand coalition all
along. Only this week, with Kohl at his heels, has the charismatic
state governor hinted that his party could accept being the junior
member of a coalition led by Kohl's party.
	   In that case, Kohl claims he would step down. Enter: Wolfgang
Schaeuble, Kohl's designated heir.
	   Schaeuble, 56, is Germany's most popular politician. But he is
paralyzed from a 1990 assassination attempt, and he doesn't deny
that there are questions about his fitness for office.
	   Anxious to avoid mistakes, both sides fought last-minute
campaign ripples Friday.
	   Kohl again denied he would raise the main sales tax if
re-elected, a response to a gaffe by one of his Cabinet members
last week who said the opposite.
	   The Social Democrats' would-be economics minister Jost
Stollmann, a computer entrepreneur without party affiliation,
renewed his call for cutting social welfare programs. But party
officials said no major cuts were envisaged.
	   The tight race right up to the final days bears some resemblance
to last time, in 1994, when it looked for a while like the Social
Democrats were going to give Kohl beating. By summer, though, Kohl
had taken a confidence-boosting lead that he never relinquished.
	   Schroeder's team has used up the 12-point lead they held in the
spring. But voters this year are conflicted right up to the end.
	   Polls show people tired of Kohl, the seasoned statesman, yet
wary of Schroeder, untested on the world stage at a time of
economic turmoil in Russia and Asia, and war in the Yugoslav
province of Kosovo.
	   The survival of Kohl's government depends not only on his
popularity but also on the tiny pro-business Free Democrats, his
junior coalition partner. Polls suggest they may not make it into
parliament this time.
	   If Schroeder wins enough votes to form a coalition, his likely
partner is the environmentalist Greens party.
	   The Greens have their best shot yet at entering government.
Their biggest threat are swing voters in the east who many predict
will opt for the ex-communist Party for Democratic Socialism as a
protest vote against Bonn politics.
	   Pollsters are at a loss to say which way the east will vote.
	   ``They change their attitudes every few minutes,'' says Dieter
Roth, of the Electoral Research Group. ``In the west there are
longstanding loyalties to parties that just don't exist in the
east.''

SKorea willing to keep working despite provocation from North
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ South Korea is willing to work towards a
final peace agreement with the North in spite of recent
provocations that include a submarine infiltration and rocket
launch, the south's foreign minister said Friday.
	   Hong Soon-young spoke to the General Assembly as representatives
of the four countries overseeing talks between the Koreas met in
New York to prepare for an upcoming round of negotiations hosted by
South Korea.
	   Friday's low-level meeting with U.S., Chinese and North and
South Korean officials was to set a date and make other
arrangements for the talks, said a State Department official,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Tensions between North and South Korea rose in June after a
submarine from the North was found entangled in a fishing net in
the waters off the South, its nine occupants dead inside. Tensions
heightened last month after the North fired a rocket over Japan
that U.S. and Japanese officials said at the time was a ballistic
missile.
	   Pyongyang said it was a satellite that failed to reach orbit.
	   ``My government deplores these acts of provocation. They pose a
serious threat to our security,'' Hong said in his speech.
	   ``But despite these acts of provocation, my government continues
to uphold the keynote of its engagement policy so that the two
Koreas might come to enjoy the benefits of peaceful coexistence.''
	   The United States, China and North and South Korea have been
working to replace a 1953 armistice that ended the Korean War. A
formal peace pact has never been signed.
	   Hong pledged to continue to work with an international
consortium developing light-water nuclear energy reactors in the
North. Pyongyang agreed in 1994 to refrain from developing nuclear
weapons in return for the reactors and fuel oil.
	   ``We also believe that both Koreas should renew their efforts to
implement the joint declaration of the denuclearization of the
Korean Peninsula of 1992,'' he said.

Storm floods afflict Haiti's rice-growing Artibonite Valley
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHAEL NORTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Torrential runoff from Hurricane
Georges flooded Haiti's breadbasket, the central Artibonite Valley,
where officials said Friday the national death toll of 87 could
rise.
	   Runoff from the mountains that line Haiti's border with the
Dominican Republic forced technicians to open floodgates on the
Peligre dam, causing irrigation canals and the Artibonite River to
overflow.
	   Hundreds of peasants fled their homes. It is not known how many
may have died in flood waters, which killed livestock and swamped
essential rice fields.
	   Highways and roads in the area 115 miles (170 kilometers) north
of Port-au-Prince were impassable Friday. A government delegation
that surveyed the damage had to overfly the area by helicopter.
	   Georges hit Haiti Wednesday with 75-mph (120-kph) winds and
rainfall totals of up to 20 inches (50 centimeters) in the
mountains. Haiti's civil defense bureau put the national death toll
Friday at 87, most occurring in rural areas.
	   Before the storm, meteorologists warned that mountain erosion
and poor maintenance of drainage systems could exacerbate flooding.
	   Two thirds of Haiti's 7.2 million people live in farming areas.
Eighty percent of the rural population of the Western Hemisphere's
poorest nation lives in dire poverty.
	   Jean-Claude Delice, director of the Valley Authority
agricultural agency, told Radio Metropole that some 40,000 acres
(100,000 hectares) were underwater.
	   ``It is an unprecedented situation. All fields in the river
basin have been flooded,'' he said.
	   The floods struck a blow to Haiti's land reform program, a pet
project of President Rene Preval, who is an agronomist.
	   Since last year, the government has distributed thousands of
acres of rice paddies in the valley to landless peasants in a bid
to reduce poverty.
	   ``All the women's groups I talk to pin their hopes on that land
redistribution. What a crushing blow to their faith in the
future.'' said Ginette Cherubin, a former cabinet minister
overseeing women's issue.
	   Last year, because of drought conditions associated with El
Nino, agricultural production dropped 2.5 percent with respect to
1996, the Inter-American Development Bank reported.
	   Haiti has scraped together a meager dlrs 130,000 to help
hurricane victims.
	   The U.N. Development Program donated dlrs 100,000 to Haiti for
disaster relief, and Germany was providing dlrs 95,000. The United
States donated water, food, blankets, sheets and clothing. France
sent specialists to help with water purification and to treat the
injured.

Chavez asks for protection of his sons
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS lead to recast; fixes style on De La Hoya in last graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Former boxing champion Julio Cesar Chavez has
asked police to protect his three sons after the family received
written threats they would be kidnapped.
	   Chavez and his wife, Amalia Carrasco, want authorities in
Sinaloa state to assign a private security guard to the boys.
Police were considering the request.
	   Chavez said his family had received similar threats in the past.
	   ``Right now, crime and kidnapping are very serious,'' he said,
pointing to the 4-month-long kidnapping of the adult son of famed
Mexican singer Vicente Fernandez, which ended this month. ``The
only thing I want is security for my sons and for me.''
	   Chavez and his wife, who have filed for divorce, are in a bitter
custody struggle over the children. Though a judicial order allows
the fighter to have his sons only on weekends, Chavez wants to keep
them because he believes he can better protect their security.
	   In his last fight, Chavez lost to WBC welterweight champion
Oscar De La Hoya on Sept. 19. Chavez has since asked the WBC for a
chance to fight for the super lightweight title.

Americans lose first set
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes; will be TOPPED with second singles match &QL; 
 &UR; By ARNIE STAPLETON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) _ Without Jim Courier, Pete Sampras, Michael
Chang and Andre Agassi, the Americans had to turn to the next
generation in their Davis Cup semifinal against Italy on Friday.
	   Experience won Round 1.
	   ``I was a little nervous and stupid,'' Jan-Michael Gambill, a
21-year-old from Spokane, Wash., said after losing to Italy's
Andrea Gaudenzi in four sets, the last settled by tiebreakers, at
the Milwaukee Arena.
	   Italy's top player, Gaudenzi didn't allow the pressure or the
partisan crowd to get to him.
	   ``I've played five years in the Davis Cup. Obviously, he was
more nervous than I was,'' said Gaudenzi, who won 6-2, 0-6, 7-6
(7-0), 7-6 (7-4). ``The first match in Davis Cup is difficult for
anybody.''
	   Gambill, who has risen from 227th to 50th in the world rankings
after reaching the third round of the U.S. Open _ losing to French
Open champion Carlos Moya in a fifth-set tiebreaker _ took
Courier's place in the draw. Courier is out because of muscle
fatigue in his right arm.
	   Todd Martin, the veteran American in Courier's absence, played
Davide Sanguinetti in the second singles match Friday.
	   Agassi, Sampras and Chang all decided against coming to
Milwaukee.
	   Gambill said he was more heartbroken over this than his U.S.
Open loss.
	   ``I was playing for a lot more than myself,'' Gambill said.
``And it doesn't feel great. It's definitely a lot more
disappointing to lose this match than any I've ever played
before.''
	   Gambill hoped to have an advantage playing indoors against
Gaudenzi, but the surface played slow and right into Gaudenzi's
strengths.
	   ``He was playing a clay-court specialist and everybody thought
he was going to win,'' the Italian said with a smile.
	   Gambill, a rising star on tour who hits two-fisted from both
sides, survived eight match points before succumbing in the second
of the tiebreakers.
	   Gaudenzi was assessed a penalty point for slamming his racket
after being warned in the 10th game of the fourth set.
	   The singles pairings are reversed on Sunday after Martin and
another Davis Cup rookie, Justin Gimelstob, take on Gaudenzi and
Diego Nargiso in Saturday's doubles match.

Foreign Office makes payment to Holocaust victims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ More than 600 Holocaust survivors living in
Britain will receive hardship payments of 400 pounds (dlrs 600) in
the next few days from a government backed fund, Britain's major
Jewish group said Friday.
	   The Board of Deputies of British Jews said that the payments
would come from 330,000 pound (dlrs 520,000) made available by the
Foreign Office to distribute to needy survivors in Britain.
	   Neville Nagler, the board's director general, said that the
payments should not be regarded as compensation.
	   ``They represent a humanitarian gesture by the British
government towards people who have experienced unimaginable
suffering and distress and are still living in need,'' Nagler said.
	   ``We hope that the payments, though modest, will provide some
tangible benefit and help to improve their lives in a positive
way,'' he said.
	   Nagler said that more funds will be allocated over coming months
to victims of the Nazis, both Jewish and non-Jewish, who come
forward. The first payments were paid to those in need who are
already known to Jewish organizations.
	   The fund was established last December at a conference on the
fate of gold looted by Nazi Germany. The British Government is
paying 1 million pounds (dlrs 1.6 million) into the fund, a third
of which is earmarked for survivors living in Britain.

Bjorkman, Johansson win opening matches to give Sweden 2-0 lead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Johansson quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHAN NASSTROM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Thomas Johansson had a perfect Davis
Cup debut on Friday night, beating world No. 5 Carlos Moya in three
straight but tough sets to give Sweden a commanding 2-0 lead in the
semifinals against Spain.
	   Johansson won 7-5, 7-6 (7-4), 7-6 (8-6) before a boisterous
sellout crowd at the Royal Tennis Hall that included former great
Bjorn Borg, who led Sweden to its first Davis Cup title here in
1975.
	   Since then, Sweden has won the world's most prestigious team
tennis event another five times and is now favored to reach its
12th final. Sweden has never lost a Davis Cup tie after taking a
2-0 first-day lead.
	   Johansson, 23, a quarterfinalist in the recent U.S. Open, said
he ''was tense and nervous before the match, but after a couple of
games I felt much better.
	   ``The fans were unbelievable! A crowd can't be much better than
this.''
	   Earlier, Johansson often had problems winning tiebreaks on the
ATP Tour, ``but I feel a lot more comfortable now than a few months
ago,'' he said.
	   In the third-set tiebreak, Moya took a 3-0 lead with service.
	   ``If he had won that tiebreak he could have won the match,''
Johansson said. ``No question about that.''
	   Returning to the site where he notched one of his finest
tournament victories in the Stockholm Open a year ago, Jonas
Bjorkman beat Alex Corretja 6-3, 7-5, 6-7 (5-7), 6-3 in the first
singles match.
	   ``I haven't played much better serve-and-volley tennis than
this,'' Bjorkman said. ``I'm extremely happy. It was one of my best
matches in the Davis Cup.
	   ``The match was what I expected it to be. We know that these
guys can play well even on this (fast) surface. But I would have
been glad if the match had been shorter.''
	   The first match lasted three hours, 25 minutes. The Swedish No.
1 will be back Saturday for the doubles match with Nicklas Kulti
against veteran Javier Sanchez and Julian Alonso.
	   During the match, Bjorkman broke a big-toe nail ``but it should
be no problem for the doubles,'' he said.
	   The opener ended with the longest game of the match, Bjorkman
finally clinching it on his fourth match point with a volley into
the open court.
	   Bjorkman's hard-fought win avenged two straight losses to the
Spaniard on hardcourts, including one in the semifinals of the
Dubai Open early this year.
	   Bjorkman got off to a perfect start as he broke Corretja to love
in the opening game. Corretja broke back to 2-2, but the Swede won
the set after breaking Corretja's serve twice in the seventh and
ninth games.
	   After trading early breaks in the second set, Bjorkman got his
next chance when Corretja fell behind 0-30 with service in the
tenth game. But Corretja clawed back to deuce, only to double fault
on Bjorkman's first set point.
	   Both players held their serve throughout the third set, forcing
the tiebreak. A double fault when leading 5-4 proved costly for
Bjorkman. The Swede missed his next two shots, giving Corretja the
lead for the first time in the tiebreak. Ahead 6-5, Corretja
clinched the set when Bjorkman's return sailed long.
	   ``It's difficult to get used to the court,'' said Corretja,
who's ranked seventh in the world. ``I haven't played indoors in 10
months. And I felt the pressure, playing the first match.''
	   Spain reached two Davis Cup finals in the 1960s, but never won
the competition. With its six wins and five runners-up finishes,
Sweden is the most successful Davis Cup nation in the last two
decades.
	   The semifinal is played on a fast Taraflex court at the Royal
Tennis Hall. A similar fast court was used in the Royal Tennis Hall
when Sweden captured the first of six Davis Cup finals in 1975 with
Borg on the team.
	   The United States, shut out by Sweden 5-0 in last year's final
at Goteborg, Sweden, plays Italy in the other semifinal this
weekend in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The Davis Cup final is scheduled
Dec. 4-6.

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Hundreds of mourners, some wearing running
shoes, others leaning on canes or pushing strollers, lined up
before dawn Friday to file past Florence Griffith Joyner's casket
in tribute to an Olympic champion who came from among them.
	   The 38-year-old sprinter, who dazzled the 1988 Seoul Olympics
with three gold medals, rose from the poverty of Watts to become
the world's fastest woman.
	   She died Monday at her home in Mission Viejo, and the cause has
not been determined.
	   Inside the chapel, Griffith Joyner was resplendent in a silk top
decorated with bright flowers. Her flowing black hair, arranged in
large ringlets, softly framed her face. She wore red lipstick and
her famously long fingernails were painted a riot of colors.
	   Cards addressed to Griffith Joyner's husband, Al Joyner, the
1984 Olympic triple jump champion, and their 7-year-old daughter,
Mary, lay on the floor near her casket.
	   People streamed from the neighborhood behind Angelus Funeral
Home and scurried across bustling Crenshaw Boulevard to line up
before the doors swung open. Carla Lee, 46, was first in line at
5:15 a.m.
	   ``I admired her for being a great athlete, devoted mom and role
model for children,'' she said. ``I know we don't have any set time
to go, but it was a shock.''
	   Some who came were classmates of Griffith Joyner at David Starr
Jordan High, where she was known as Dee Dee, a nickname for her
first name Delorez. Only after her Olympic success did she pick up
the moniker FloJo.
	   Some spoke of her performance in Seoul, where won the 100- and
200-meter sprints and the 400-meter relay. At her death, she was
still the fastest woman in history.
	   ``When she was in the Olympics, being a young lady from South
Central, seeing her cross the finish line let me know a lot of
things were possible,'' said Dione Washington of Los Angeles.
	   But most talked of a woman whose flamboyant fashion sense
infused track and field with a flair it had never seen. They also
spoke of how she never forgot her roots.
	   ``You feel like you just lost a member of your family. She's a
shining example of someone who's overcome,'' said Eric Dickey of
Los Angeles, who wore a sweat suit and running shoes. ``Not only
did she succeed, she reached back and lifted others up. She's an
icon.''
	   The funeral is Saturday in Lake Forest in Orange County.

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ In its first game since the World Cup debacle,
the U.S. soccer team will play Australia in an exhibition game on
Nov. 6 at San Jose, California.
	   The Americans have been without a head coach since Steve Sampson
quit June 29, four days after the United States lost to Yugoslavia
in its final World Cup game. D.C. United coach Bruce Arena is
expected to take over the team later this year.
	   The United States, which hoped to advance to the World Cup
quarterfinals, went 0-3 in the first round and finished last in the
32-nation field.
	   Australia lost a playoff to Iran last year for the final World
Cup spot.

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS (AP) _ Former coup leader and presidential front-runner
Hugo Chavez said Friday he wants Venezuela to continue having
friendly relations with the United States.
	   ``We are very interested in continuing good relations, in
improving them to the upmost,'' Chavez told reporters after meeting
with U.S. Ambassador John Maisto.
	   Chavez described the meeting as ``cordial,'' while Maisto told
reporters it was ``a rather fruitful exchange.''
	   The United States has barred Chavez from entering the country to
address businessmen and academics because of his role in a failed
coup attempt Feb. 4, 1992.
	   Maisto said the visa issue didn't come up during the meeting.
Questioned by reporters, Chavez declined to criticize the United
States, saying that granting a visa was a sovereign decision of the
U.S. government.
	   Venezuela is one of the top foreign suppliers of oil to the
United States.
	   Maisto plans to meet all the major candidates for the Dec. 6
presidential election. He met Tuesday with former state Gov.
Henrique Salas Romer, who holds the number two spot in opinion
polls.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES 3rd, 8th and final grafs with more water, power
service restored, agricultural damages at dlrs 300 million,
National Guard delivering aid to mountain towns. No pickup. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   TOA BAJA, Puerto Rico (AP) _ After Hurricane Hortense's rain
swamped Wanda Cortes' home in a squatter community last year, she
used federal aid to build a second home of plywood on top of what
remained of her house.
	   On Monday, Hurricane Georges' 110 mph (175 kph) winds blew away
her second floor.
	   From the most humble homes to luxury beachfront hotels, people
were feeling the effects of another day without basic services. By
Friday, the electric power authority had restored service to about
18 percent of its customers, and water service was resuming in much
of San Juan.
	   Cortes wasn't allowed to build a permanent concrete home because
the community, built six years ago on an abandoned cane field, is
not legal, she said.
	   Her eyes filled with tears and her voice trembled with rage as
she related how municipal officials told her that this time she
will not get the federal aid because the 400-family community is
illegal.
	   ``When (President Bill) Clinton sends the aid, it's for the
people of Puerto Rico, not just for certain people,'' said Cortes,
34, who works as a maid. ``We're human beings, too.''
	   In the San Juan area, power was restored to filtration plants at
both main reservoirs that supply water, allowing officials to begin
producing drinking water Friday. Water had been in short supply, as
hotels and other large buildings exhausted their storage.
	   Long lines formed under hot sunshine as people waited to fill
jugs with water from tanker trucks supplied by the government.
Thousands lined up at ice factories to buy ice.
	   In the eastern town of San Lorenzo, a 67-year-old woman waiting
in line Thursday to receive an emergency aid check from the
government collapsed and later died, police said.
	   In Puerto Rico, there were 12 storm-related deaths.
	   In the southwestern town of Yauco, police were concerned about a
neighborhood left completely cut off and seriously damaged by the
hurricane. Edwin Ramos, assistant police chief for the southern
region, said 42 people were totally isolated in the hillside area.
	   Puerto Rico's National Guard was delivering water and food to
isolated mountain communities, Gov. Pedro Rossello said. Damages to
Puerto Rico's agricultural crops reached dlrs 300 million, Rossello
said, including the loss of more than half the coffee crop.

Nigerian leader appeals for investment, debt relief
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Nigeria's leader pledged to turn back a
tradition of patronage and corruption in public enterprise in an
appeal Friday for foreign investment and debt relief.
	   Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar highlighted a program of sweeping
economic reforms that includes partial privatization of Nigeria's
oil, telecommunications and power industries, and the establishment
of a non-discriminatory regulatory framework during a briefing with
reporters.
	   Abubakar cited those measures, as well as a commitment to fair
elections and a return to civilian rule next year, in his plea for
foreign investment and debt relief.
	   ``In the light of these efforts, we ask our creditors to take
sense of our reforms and the unique problems facing our nation, at
this time to grant us debt relief,'' Abubakar said.
	   A day earlier in his speech to the General Assembly, Abubakar
urged a lifting of sanctions on his country, citing its progress on
democracy and human rights.
	   Abubakar, who assumed power in June after the sudden death of
Gen. Sani Abacha, has shown a willingness to improve Nigeria's
damaged international image by releasing political prisoners and
allowing the formation of political parties.
	   Still, deeply entrenched pockets of patronage that have sapped
millions of dollars of oil earnings and led to the deterioration of
the nation's infrastructure will be hard to overcome, according to
Jerry Kepes, an analyst with the Petroleum Finance Group, a
Washington-based group of industry analysts.
	   ``There's been some real movement,'' Kepes said. ``The general
sense is this guy is trying to do different things here. These
things take a while. It's an entrenched system.''
	   The impacts of political patronage and corruption have severely
damaged Nigeria's oil sector. Nigeria's refining sector, one of the
largest in Africa, is running at only 30 percent of capacity.
	   Abubakar said privatization will include the Nigerian National
Petroleum Corp., as well as other publicly run industries, and that
oil rights could be offered as incentives to investors.
	   ``The Nigerians themselves have seen how government oriented
enterprises are not yielding results,'' Abubakar said. ``Our energy
sector is not performing as it should be and I believe everybody is
yearning for changes. I don't see any problems.''

Kuwait calls for continued international pressure on Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Kuwait's foreign minister called Friday
for continued international pressure on Iraq to comply with U.N.
resolutions, and said Baghdad's defiance was underscored by its
refusal to express regret for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   ``The long series of crises triggered by the Iraqi government
are pre-calculated attempts from time to time to disavow and
circumvent its legal obligations,'' Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah
told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly session.
	   ``The sad certainty, alas, is that all these crises contribute
to the perpetuation of the sanctions for which the government of
Iraq alone bears full responsibility,'' he said.
	   He said Iraq was trying to mislead the world with claims that it
had lived up to its obligations.
	   ``How could one reconcile that claim with the fact that we have
not yet heard from Iraq any declaration or seen any gesture
suggesting that Iraq regrets what it has done,'' Sheik Ahmed said.
	   He called on Baghdad to release all Kuwaitis captured during its
seven-month occupation of the emirate. Kuwait accuses Iraq of
holding some 500 of its citizens, a charge denied by Baghdad.
	   Sheik Ahmed also called on Israel to live up to obligations
agreed with the Arabs, including the return of all war-gained Arab
land.

Michael Douglas tries to put global spotlight on small arms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Princess Diana put the campaign to ban
anti-personnel land mines in the world spotlight. Now, actor and
producer Michael Douglas is trying to become the celebrity face of
a new campaign to control the spread of light weapons.
	   Norway and Canada, which helped launch the global drive for a
land mine treaty, are trying to duplicate their success by
spearheading a crusade to curb far more deadly small arms.
	   The United Nations, the United States, many governments and
voluntary organizations are joining the campaign. And on Friday
Douglas joined in, making his first speech in his new role as a
United Nations Messenger of Peace on the dangers of the global
proliferation of small arms.
	   These arms _ assault rifles, machineguns, pistols and
grenade-launchers _ are the weapons of choice in dozens of
conflicts from the Congo to Kosovo. They kill millions of innocent
civilians, especially children. And after the fighting ends, they
often wind up in the hands of criminals, smugglers and terrorists.
	   ``The sad fact is that while the major armies of the world are
disarming, civilians are rearming,'' Douglas said in a luncheon
speech during a daylong seminar at the United Nations. ``If these
weapons are not properly controlled, peace will become obsolete and
so will humanity.''
	   To those who blame Hollywood for being part of the problem by
glorifying violence, ``I would ask them to remember that the
violence Hollywood exports is fictional, while the tens of billions
of dollars in small arms that various countries export is a
reality.''
	   Recalling that he had been awakened to the dangers of small arms
when John Lennon was fatally shot in the back five times in 1980,
Douglas said he brought to the campaign his success in the motion
picture business.
	   ``I want to dedicate that fame to your noble purpose,'' he said.
``I hope we can work together to turn our weapons of death and
destruction into the plowshares that can provide food where there
is famine, and peace where there is strife. We must all never
forget that ultimately we must make this issue pertinent, relevant
and significant to everyone.''
	   Princess Diana's focus on land mine victims before her death on
Aug. 31, 1997 put the issue in the public eye. The treaty aimed at
eliminating land mines was signed by more than 120 countries in
Ottawa in December and will go into force in March in the 41
countries that have ratified it.
	   But the small arms problem is more complex _ and there is no
agreement yet on the best way to combat the illicit trade in light
weapons, tighten controls on legal sales, and reduce existing
stocks of small arms.
	   Norway, which hosted a conference on small arms in Oslo in July
attended by 21 countries, announced earlier this week at the U.N.
General Assembly that it is launching a U.N. trust fund for the
control, collection and reduction of small arms with dlrs 2
million.
	   Norwegian Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek told Friday's seminar
that his country decided to focus on practical actions that can be
implemented immediately because millions of people experience
insecurity, injury and death from small arms every day.
	   ``We cannot afford to wait until all the members of the
international community agree on actions to be taken,'' he said.
	   A global conference on small arms, which is currently being
discussed at the United Nations, could eventually produce a plan of
action, he said, and new global regulatory mechanisms are also
being discussed.
	   Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy said he believes ``the
priority'' should be adoption of a global convention prohibiting
the international transfer of small arms to any parties except
governments _ which would cut the illicit trade.
	   Such a convention, he said, could be used as a focal point to
mobilize public support.
	   ``There is a momentum under way,'' he said. ``This is part of
the new humanitarian social agenda.''

Former constable charged in 1994 murder of honeymoon couple
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ A former police constable was
charged Friday with the 1994 murder of a Canadian couple on their
honeymoon.
	   Former constable Ronald Bobby Dougardeen, who was already in
jail on car theft charges, was charged Friday with killing the
couple and will face a hearing on Oct. 5.
	   The bodies of Geoff and Sherelle Ann Barnes were found on
Blanchisseuse Beach on the northeast coast of Trinidad in May,
1994. Drowning was the cause of death, according to an autopsy, but
traces of cocaine were found in both bodies.
	   Police said the case had been dormant for a long time but was
reopened recently when new information was found. They did not
disclose the new evidence.
	   Local police investigated the case along with Toronto police
officials.

Away from lab tests, Mike Tyson enjoys fans, visits mosque

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Mike Tyson, who is undergoing psychological tests
that could make or break his boxing career, has made himself at
home in Boston.
	   The man who served a prison term for rape and shocked the boxing
world by biting off part of Evander Holyfield's ear has been
cheered and kissed by adoring fans in Beantown.
	   And he has responded with smiles and autographs.
	   On Thursday, during a break from his third day of tests at
Massachusetts General Hospital, Tyson attended a prayer service at
a mosque in Sharon, about 20 miles (30 kilometers) south of Boston.
	   On the way back, he leaned out the window of his stretch
limousine at a traffic light in Boston's Roxbury neighborhood and
signed a young man's baseball cap. A school bus full of children
waved and shouted to him.
	   Earlier, Tyson took a stroll with his entourage near the
hospital.
	   ``He's loved it,'' Tyson adviser Shelly Finkel said. ``It's not
often that he says, `Look, Shell, let's just walk in the street to
go eat lunch.'''
	   Finkel said the visit has brought back memories for Tyson of his
trips to Boston from Catskill, New York in the early 1980s.
	   The fun and fan support contrast sharply with the seriousness of
his visit ordered by the Nevada Athletic Commission.
	   The commission has asked a team of psychiatrists and
neuropsychologists to decide if Tyson is mentally fit to return to
the ring. Specifically, they have asked doctors to gauge his
ability to handle stress and predict the chances he would lose
control while fighting.
	   Their recommendations are expected to weigh heavily in the
commission's Oct. 3 vote on whether to return Tyson's boxing
license, stripped when he bit Holyfield's ears.
	   Finkel said Tyson expects to complete the testing Saturday and
is hopeful the medical team will give him a positive report.
	   Hospital spokeswoman Peggy Slasman said the hospital could not
comment on the progress of the tests, which have included hundreds
of questions, a medical examination, drug tests and an MRI to study
his brain.
	   ``His attorneys have basically asked us not to provide any
information,'' she said.

Nanny Louise Woodward enrolls for three-year legal degree
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Louise Woodward, the former au pair convicted of
killing an American baby in her care, has enrolled on a three-year
university course to study law, a tabloid newspaper reported
Saturday.
	   The Mirror said that Woodward will work for the bachelor's
degree at South Bank University in London, and had spent Friday
mingling with other students at the college's open day for new
students.
	   The newspaper published two photographs of Woodward, 20, which
it said were taken at the university on Friday, and reported that
she had signed up to the university's law society, which holds mock
court cases.
	   Ms. Woodward has generally kept a low public profile since
returning to England on June 18 after a Massachusetts court upheld
her conviction of involuntary manslaughter in the death of
8-month-old Matthew Eappen. He died of head injuries in February
1997 while in her care.
	   Ms. Woodward maintains she is innocent. Her lawyers argued in
court that the baby died from an old injury.

Telecom Italia agrees to Murdoch as potential partner in pay TV
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Telecom Italia's board gave its blessings
Friday to pursuing Rupert Murdoch as a partner in the development
of digital TV in Italy, despite strong political opposition.
	   Telecommunications officials have spoken of a ''colonization''
of Italian television if the Italian media magnate is allowed into
the country's pay-TV market.
	   The board authorized Telecom Italia to work with RAI state
television in an accord on digital TV, and singled out British Sky
Broadcasting Group as a good potential partner.
	   The British company is 40 percent owned by Murdoch's News Corp.
	   If negotiations don't conclude by Oct. 5, Telecom is free to
pursue other solutions on its own, the company said.
	   RAI board member Alberto Conti said Thursday that the state TV
company was likely to agree to an alliance with News Corp. _ on
condition that Italians keep an absolute majority, and that Murdoch
confine himself only to pay TV in Italy.
	   Analysts have said Murdoch's presence would be a plus for
Telecom Italia and the market as a whole. His aggressiveness and
the heightened competition could boost the size and development of
the Italian digital television market, they contend.
	   Last week, an Italian newspaper reported that News Corp. wanted
a 40 percent stake in Italian digital pay television unit Stream.
Murdoch, the report said, would pay Telecom, which owns 100 percent
of Stream, between dlrs 1,500 to dlrs 2,000 for each of its 80,000
subscribers. (dj-ek)

McCord shoots 65 for lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Playing in his third tournament as a senior,
television announcer Gary McCord shot a 7-under 65 Friday to take a
one-stroke lead in the dlrs 1.3 million Boone Valley Classic.
	   McCord made 10 birdies to overcome a bogey and a double bogey.
	   Bruce Summerhays and Jose Maria Canizares each shot 66s.
	   McCord, a CBS golf announcer, survived a double bogey on No. 2
after hitting an approach shot into a water hazard.
	   McCord, who is playing in the tournament on an exemption, said
he is playing better now tha he did as a member of the regular
tour.
	   ``I couldn't play a lick on the PGA Tour and I was broke,'' he
said. ``Now I have money and some sort of a game.''
	   McCord said he still has a long way to go to win a tournament.
	   ``I'm prepared physcially to win it but I'm not sure I can do it
mentally,'' he said.
	   Summerhays, who lost in a playoff last week in the Kroger Senior
Classic, had six birdies and no bogeys to catch Canizares who
finished a couple of hours earlier.
	   Summerhays has finished second in his last two tournaments and
is eighth on the money list. Summerhays said he was enjoying his
recent streak.
	   ``The birdies seem to keep coming and I am on a roll and
enjoying it,'' he said.
	   ``Golf will humble me again someday,'' he said. ``This ride is
fun right now.''
	   Canizares, who said he was fighting a balky putter, also had six
birdies with no bogeys.
	   ``My putting has not been very good lately but it came around on
the back nine,'' Canizares said.
	   Canizares, yet to win on the senior tour, made six birdies in
his last 10 holes and did not a have a putt longer than 12 feet (3
1/2 meters) during that run.
	   ``I developed more confidence in my putting as the round went
on,'' he said. ``I guess that helped make my putting good.
	   ``The pressure increases each day and the course changes. I feel
I got the best I could out of the course today,'' said Canizares,
who is 13th in earnings this year sixth in scoring average.
	   Don Bies, Graham Marsh, Tommy Aaron and Mike McCullough were at
67 and six players had 68s.
	   Nine of the top 10 money leaders are entered in the event,
played at the 6,731-yard (6,125-meter) Boone Valley County Club,
about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of St. Louis.
	   Defending champion Hale Irwin, who leads the tour in earnings,
shot a 69.

Workers at Brazilian mint arrested for making extra money
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ If you don't have any change to
spare, why not make some?
	   It seemed like a pretty good idea to four workers at the
national mint in Rio de Janeiro, Brazilian media reported Friday.
	   The four were arrested last week for making at least 6,000 reals
(dlrs 5128), in extra coins for personal use. Federal Police,
however, only announced the arrests Friday.
	   The four were caught after management noticed the machines that
make the coins registered they were making more money than they
were supposed to, Globo television reported.
	   Police are still investigating if others may have been involved
in the scheme.
	   Police still don't how the workers got the extra coins past the
mint's tight security, but they found bags of freshly minted coins
in the worker's homes and cars, Globo television reported.
	   The workers face up to 12 years in prison if convicted.

Americans down 2-0 to Italians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with second match &QL; 
 &UR; By ARNIE STAPLETON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) _ The United States sure could have used Jim
Courier, Pete Sampras, Michael Chang or Andre Agassi in their Davis
Cup semifinal against Italy on Friday.
	   Jan-Michael Gambill lost his Davis Cup debut to Andrea Gaudenzi
and Todd Martin, the veteran American left on the roster, was upset
by Davide Sanguinetti in three sets as Italy took a stunning 2-0
lead over the shellshocked Americans.
	   Sanguinetti, ranked 47th, beat the 28th-ranked Martin 7-6 (7-0),
6-3, 7-6 (10-8), putting the Italians, who won all four
tiebreakers, on the verge of a huge upset.
	   Martin, who struggled with his first serve and Sanguinetti's
consistent returns, and another Davis Cup rookie, Justin Gimelstob,
take on Gaudenzi and Diego Nargiso in Saturday's doubles match. A
loss would snap an 11-year home winning streak for the United
States.
	   The Americans have won 18 straight Davis Cup matches on home
courts, the last loss in 1987 when Boris Becker led West Germany to
a 3-2 victory in Hartford, Connecticut.
	   The only time the Americans have ever overcame a 2-0 deficit in
the Davis Cup was in 1934, when they rallied to defeat Australia in
Britain.
	   If they can avoid the sweep, the singles pairings are reversed
on Sunday.
	   Agassi, Sampras and Chang all decided against coming to
Milwaukee, and Courier was held out because he's not match-ready
with lingering muscle fatigue in his right biceps.
	   So the Americans had to turn to the next generation, and
experience won Round 1.
	   ``I was a little nervous and stupid,'' Gambill, a 21-year-old
from Spokane, Washington, said after losing to Gaudenzi in four
sets at the Milwaukee Arena.
	   Italy's top player, Gaudenzi didn't allow the pressure or the
partisan crowd to get to him.
	   ``I've played five years in the Davis Cup. Obviously, he was
more nervous than I was,'' said Gaudenzi, who won 6-2, 0-6, 7-6
(7-0), 7-6 (7-4). ``The first match in Davis Cup is difficult for
anybody.''
	   Gambill, who has risen from 227th to 50th in the world rankings
after reaching the third round of the U.S. Open _ losing to French
Open champion Carlos Moya in a fifth-set tiebreaker _ said this
loss hurt more.
	   ``I was playing for a lot more than myself,'' Gambill said.
	   Gambill hoped to have an advantage playing indoors against
Gaudenzi, but the surface played slow and right into Gaudenzi's
strengths.
	   ``He was playing a clay-court specialist and everybody thought
he was going to win,'' Gaudenzi said with a smile.
	   Gambill, a rising star on tour who hits two-fisted from both
sides, survived eight match points before succumbing in the second
of the tiebreakers.

Leonard, Maginnes share one-stroke lead in Texas Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with Friday's play &QL; 
 &UR; By KELLEY SHANNON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN ANTONIO (AP) _ A three-week vacation is paying off for
Justin Leonard. He's rested, relaxed and tied for the lead of the
Texas Open.
	   Leonard recouped from some bad early shots and made five birdies
Friday on the way to a second straight 5-under-par 67. His 10-under
134 total matched that of John Maginnes, who usually plays on the
Nike Tour.
	   Loren Roberts, Bob Estes, Hal Sutton and Brad Fabel were one
stroke behind the leaders after two rounds. David Frost and Tommy
Armour III were another stroke back.
	   Playing his first tournament since late August, Leonard _ No. 8
on the money list with dlrs 1.27 million _ didn't seem to feel any
ill effects from his time away from the golf course.
	   ``It's one of the first times I've really been able in the
middle of the season to put my clubs down and not worry about it,''
Leonard said. ``It's nice to be back here playing, especially to
come back and play well.''
	   The winner of the dlrs 1.7 million tournament, which is
sponsored by Westin and played at LaCantera Golf Club, receives
dlrs 306,000.
	   Fabel made the jump to the group tied for third with a 64, while
Estes had a 67 and Roberts and Sutton had 68s. Frost got to 136
with a 64, while Armour had a 67.
	   Leonard began the day in a pack of 10 players two strokes behind
first-round leader D.A. Weibring. Starting on the back nine,
Leonard got his first birdie on the par-4 11th when he made a
12-foot (3.6-meter) putt.
	   The 14th, 15th and 16th holes proved tricky, as Leonard hit the
ball off the fairway repeatedly. But he managed to par each hole
then made a birdie from a foot on the par-4 18th.
	   ``I had time to recover,'' Leonard said of his poor early shots.
``It's not always bad to hit a couple of shots like that during a
round because it kind of woke me up.''
	   Leonard birdied No. 1 by making another 12-footer (3.6 meters)
and wrapped up his bogey-free round with birdies on the last two
holes.
	   Maginnes, playing under a sponsor's exemption, also started the
day two strokes behind the leader and shot a 67.
	   ``I'm pretty encouraged. Somebody's got to win this golf
tournament,'' said Maginnes, delighting in the prospect of a
possible pairing with Leonard this weekend. ``It'll be fun. ...
It'll probably take the gallery seven or eight holes to figure out
who I am.''
	   Maginnes also started on the par-5 10th and made a putt for his
first birdie. He got four more birdies before the turn. He bogeyed
the par-4 No. 2 after hitting into a bunker, then two-putted on the
par-5 5th for a birdie.
	   Another bogey on No. 6 then a birdie on No. 7 left Maginnes at
10 under for the round.
	   ``I played as well as I can play. It wasn't an easy one,''
Maginnes said.
	   Weibring shot a 74 Friday and was at 139.
	   Defending champion Tim Herron had a 73 for a 143 total.
	   U.S. Amateur champion Hank Kuehne, after blowing his otherwise
respectable first round on the second-to-last hole Thursday, shot
an even-par 72 Friday for a 149 total.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Most stocks fell Friday, but blue-chip stocks
edged higher as investors shrugged off worries about the
near-collapse of a leading hedge fund. The Dow Jones industrial
average rose 26.78 points _ or by 0.3 percent _ to 8,028.77 despite
an early 112-point slide that temporarily wiped out the rest of
Wednesday's 257-point surge. On Thursday, the Dow fell 152 points,
mostly as a result of profit-taking on the prior day's big gains.
(US-CLOSING STOCKS, WORLD MARKETS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Spending by American consumers rebounded in
August after falling in July because of the General Motors strikes.
Income growth nearly kept up. And sales of existing homes slipped a
bit from a record high. Spending jumped 0.6 percent to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of dlrs 5.84 trillion after a rare 0.1 percent
drop in July, the first in two years, the Commerce Department said
Friday. Personal incomes, meanwhile, rose 0.5 percent _ the most in
six months _ to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of dlrs 7.17
trillion. However, some economists say recent stock market
volatility should reduce consumer spending in the months ahead.
(US-ECONOMY)
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ European finance ministers downplayed
fears that the spreading global economic turmoil threatens to
derail growth within the region as it prepares to launch its single
currency next year. ``Europe has become an anchor of financial
stability,'' Austrian Finance Minister Rudolf Edlinger said Friday
as a two-day meeting of finance ministers and central bank
governors from European Union nations got under way. ``We expect
dynamic economic growth in 1999.'' Edlinger's optimism was echoed
by other officials at the meeting despite signs that the worldwide
financial turbulence is beginning to take some of the shine off
Europe's economic recovery. (EU-FINANCE)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's top economic official quit his job in
anger Friday, and the new government got some bad news from the
International Monetary Fund: no new loan installments this month.
Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime minister in charge of economic
policy, quit after President Boris Yeltsin announced the
appointment of a holdover finance minister who served in the
previous two administrations. Shokhin said the minister, Mikhail
Zadornov, might know finance, but ``his professionalism has not
been confirmed in the past month,'' the Interfax news agency
reported. Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov lashed out at Shokhin for
his ``whimsical demarche,'' and said he was acting irresponsibly
during a time of crisis. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ The Swiss Federal Banking Commission
on Friday asked the United Bank of Switzerland to provide details
of its involvement in troubled U.S. private investment partnership
Long Term Capital Management. The commission said it is worried by
the bank's loss of almost 1 billion Swiss francs (dlrs 726 million)
in the third quarter. Part of the loss is accounted for by a 950
million franc (dlrs 689 million) charge the bank has written off
against its investment in LTCM. UBS is part of a 15-strong
consortium of major banks and investment firms that have agreed in
principle to inject nearly dlrs 4 billion of new financing into
LTCM, a so-called hedge fund. (SWITZERLAND-UBS INVESTIGATION)
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Cash-strapped Pakistan will hold
another round of talks with global donor agencies in October in
Washington in a bid to get a bailout package for its battered
economy jolted by international sanctions and a dlrs 32 billion
external debt, a senior official said Friday. ``Our discussions
will resume in Washington from Oct. 2,'' Hafeez Pasha, finance
adviser to prime minister told a news briefing. Pakistan is hoping
for the bail out package, particularly after Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif promised to sign a global nuclear test ban treaty while in
New York this week. (PAKISTAN-ECONOMY)
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ KLM Royal Dutch Airlines issued a
profit warning Friday for its second quarter and fiscal year ending
March 1999, saying revenues have been hit by the global financial
crisis and the recent pilots' strike at Northwest Airlines. The
Dutch carrier said that costs related to the strike at Northwest,
KLM's U.S. partner, will result in a one-off charge of 50 million
guilders (dlrs 26.6 million) in its fiscal second quarter ending
Sept. 12. KLM said the full-year earnings will also be ``less
favorable'' due to weaker projections for volume and yields. The
airline said a deterioration of the global economy has slowed
growth of business volume to less than 1 percent. (NETHERLANDS-KLM)

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ U.S. and French aid
teams joined overwhelmed Dominican officials Friday in trying to
feed the hungry and thirsty survivors of Hurricane Georges, which
killed more than 300 in the Caribbean. In a broad landscape of
flooding north of the capital of Santo Domingo, villages became
islands surrounded by miles of muddy floodwaters. Victims
frantically waved as rescue aircraft flew overhead. Eight hundred
people swarmed around a Dominican air force helicopter when it
tried to land Friday on an island in the town of Matamomon. Its
three-man crew kicked off desperate people trying to climb aboard
and tossed food rations to those screaming on the ground below.
Food and water stocks ran perilously low after Georges struck here
Tuesday, bringing 110 mph (177 kph) winds that destroyed 90 percent
of the nation's food crops. (CARIBBEAN-HURRICANE)
	   BERLIN (AP) _ With polls predicting one of the tightest races in
postwar German history, Chancellor Helmut Kohl and challenger
Gerhard Schroeder both made final appeals to supporters to get out
and vote in Sunday's parliamentary election. ``It's up to you
now,'' Schroeder told an enthusiastic crowd of 8,000 at his
campaign finale Friday night in Berlin, just before the band struck
up his team's theme song, ``Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now.''
Schroeder called Kohl ``the chancellor of unemployment,''
responsible for record double-digit joblessness, and said Sunday's
election was a choice between ``a new start or stagnation.'' In the
Rhine River city of Mainz, Kohl also called the election a pivotal
one for Germany. But he saw it as a choice between sticking with
him and the safe ``politics of the middle,'' or a swing to the
radical left with Schroeder's Social Democrats. (GERMANY-POLITICS)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Heading into a diplomatic showdown with Israel
at the United Nations, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said Friday
he had the ``sacred right'' to declare a state in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip in May and appealed to the world to help him. Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had warned only a day earlier
that such a declaration would lead to a ``complete collapse'' of
Mideast peacemaking and that Israel would retaliate. Despite the
heated rhetoric, Netanyahu gave an upbeat assessment of the
negotiations with the Palestinians on a West Bank troop withdrawal.
In a briefing for Israeli reporters in New York, Netanyahu
confirmed that he was ready to withdraw from 13 percent of the West
Bank, with 3 percent of that area set aside as a nature reserve
where Palestinians could not build for the time being.
(ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A Bosnian Serb hard-liner
was elected president of the Serb-run part of Bosnia-Herzegovina
during national elections two weeks ago, the international
organizers confirmed Friday. Ultranationalist Nikola Poplasen
defeated the U.S.-backed incumbent, Biljana Plavsic, by 38,000
votes, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
announced. OSCE said overall, the results of the Sept. 12-13
general elections were encouraging because moderates who support
the 1995 Dayton peace agreement showed significant gains in other
races, including the Bosnian Serb assembly. But Poplasen's surprise
victory clearly raises questions about the effectiveness of
international efforts to build ethnic tolerance in this Balkan
country in the wake of the 3 1-2-year war which ended with the
Dayton accords. (BOSNIA-ELECTIONS)
	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ The United States airlifted former
warlord and now fugitive Roosevelt Johnson out of Liberia on Friday
to end a week-old standoff that began when he sought refuge inside
the American Embassy. One helicopter swooped down on a small
landing pad at the back of the sprawling embassy compound, picked
up Johnson and a handful of his supporters and ferried them away
amid tight security. A second helicopter arrived minutes later to
take out the rest of the evacuees. A total of 28 people were flown
out Friday, including two of Johnson's sons and two close aides.
The flights also included 23 Johnson supporters who sneaked into
the embassy grounds last week during a government operation to
arrest the former warlord. Johnson was flown to a West African
peacekeepers' base in Freetown, Sierra Leone, U.S. embassy
officials said. (LIBERIA)

<TEXT>
	   NEW BETHESDA, South Africa (AP) _ Convinced she was going blind,
reclusive artist Helen Martins drank caustic soda and killed
herself more than 20 years ago.
	   Martins was virtually unknown during her lifetime, shunned by
many of her neighbors who regarded her as eccentric or insane. But
now the surreal legacy she left behind has become a lifeline for
this desert town where she was born and died.
	   For more than 25 years, Martins labored on transforming her
unassuming single-story house into a work of art. She built
hundreds of concrete statues and coated her walls with finely
crushed, colored glass.
	   Today the ``Owl House'' is a national monument that attracts
thousands of tourists a year to New Bethesda, a tiny white-washed
village in the heart of the arid Great Karoo region 700 kilometers
(420 miles) southwest of Johannesburg.
	   Koos Malgas, 61, worked with Martins for 12 years and was the
last person to speak to her before she drank her lethal brew at the
age of 77. He says she will be remembered as a genius.
	   ``In the first place, I thought she was mad, but after I started
working with her I changed my mind,'' said Malgas, a wiry,
gray-haired man wearing blue overalls. ``She made things which no
other people could do.''
	   Martins' tin-roofed house stands on the edge of town and looks
normal. But inside the walls are intricately patterned in yellow,
blue, green and red glass, and the rooms are cluttered with
figurines of mermaids and gigantic mirrors.
	   Shelves are stacked with jars containing powdered glass. The
years spent crushing bottles in an old coffee grinder probably
caused glass particles to damage Martins' eyes.
	   In the yard, cement camels, caterpillars with human faces and
beckoning maidens share space with dozens of wide-eyed owls, from
which the house takes its name.
	   One corner contains two straining statues pulling back the hands
of a clock with wire ropes, as if trying to halt time. On the other
side of the clock, a statue of an old man holds his head in
despair.
	   Last year, more than 10,000 tourists visited New Bethesda, which
only got electricity six years ago and still has no paved roads.
Some came from as far away as New Zealand and the United States.
	   ``Without the Owl House hardly anyone would come to New
Bethesda,'' said Debbie Bruinders, who runs a craft and coffee shop
that caters to tourists. ``We have been in business for a year and
a quarter and each month the numbers go up.''
	   The Owl House is run by a trust set up by the village council.
Admission is 80 cents.
	   There are several coffee houses and art galleries in the town,
but no hotels and no restaurants. Overnight guests stay in the
homes of villagers who are away and two homes offer meals to
visitors who book in adance.
	   Martins, who killed herself in 1976, would probably be surprised
at the popularity of her house. She rarely allowed visitors inside
and existed on a meager diet while spending most of her money on
supplies for her work.
	   Her fame has grown since her death. Athol Fugard wrote a play
called ``The Road to Mecca'' that was made into a film starring
Kathy Bates as a depressed woman who visits Martins, played by
Yvonne Bryceland.
	   Few pictures of Martins survive, but a handful of old black and
white photos show a wizened, serious-faced old woman standing among
her forest of strange creations.
	   She worked on her statues with mixed-race helpers, such as
Malgas, from the local township. Those associations were frowned on
during the apartheid era, especially in a small, conservative
village, and led to her isolation in New Bethesda's close-knit
community.
	   Now the village that turned its back on Martins when she was
alive has become dependent on her legacy.
	   Unemployment is rife in rural areas such as New Bethesda and
money brought in by the Owl House helps improve services for the
inhabitants _ fewer than 100 whites and about 800 coloreds, as
mixed-race people are known.
	   Malgas, a former sheep-shearer, now earns a living repairing the
statues he helped build and making owl figurines he sells to
visitors.
	   Entering the house of art can evoke emotional responses. In the
visitors' book, one South African wrote, ``She was mad,'' while an
American tourist put, ``Bizarre but beautiful.''
	   The pressure of popularity is starting to take its toll on a
work that was never designed for public exhibition. Visitors
touching the statues and the harsh extremes of the Karoo's desert
climate have weakened the concement and cracked the glass on many
of the figures.
	   Owl House curator Mark Wilby says the cement is being repaired
and research being done on coating the figures with a resin that
will protect them.
	   ``We are trying not just to patch things up, but to strengthen
them,'' Wilby said. ``They need to be preserved.''

	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ El Salvador's former rebels,
the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, convene this weekend
to select a nominee for the 1999 presidential vote with the hope of
winning government power through the ballot box.
	   Delegates will choose between a former human rights prosecutor,
Victoria Marina de Aviles, and one of the founders of the rebel
movement, Racundo Guardado.
	   Two previous efforts to pick a candidate failed when no one
managed to win enough votes: At least 518 of the 1,034 delegates
must support the nominee.
	   The party of the former leftist rebel movement, known by its
Spanish initials FMLN, has been split between the old-line, which
supports de Aviles, and reformists who had backed Managua Mayor
Hector Silva and, later, economist Hector Dada Hirezi.
	   Both Silva and Dada Hirezi withdrew as candidates. Guardado, a
former rebel commander, entered the race at the last hour.

	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Nicaraguan school children are being
invited to welcome the capital city's latest official guests of
honor _ three endangered sea turtles.
	   The honored trio flew to Managua on Thursday as part of a ``Save
the Sea Turtle'' campaign and exhibition.
	   The turtles, which came from the Miskitos Islands in the
Antilles and from a Nicaraguan ecological reserve, are in danger of
extinction and deserve full protection from the government and
society, scientist Jaime Incer said.
	   Many of the sea turtles suffocate when they become trapped in
industrial fishing nets, others are hunted for their meat, he said.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico City's Human Rights Commission has
demanded city prosecutors explain why three teen-agers who
allegedly were kidnapped and raped by police officers have now
retracted their complaints.
	   Commission inspector Antonio Aguilar Valdez told reporters
Thursday that the retractions, filed last week, were suspicious.
	   The girls, ages 13, 15, and 18, asserted they were kidnapped by
police in July after they stopped to ask directions to a Mexico
City park. They said they were held for three days at police horse
stables, where two of them were raped, before finally escaping.
	   The allegations provoked widespread public outrage against
notorious corruption within the police force. At least nine
officers were charged.
	   The Mexico City Attorney General's Office said Wednesday the
allegations are supported by physical evidence, including medical
examinations of the girls and samples of semen and pubic hair
recovered at the stables.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Municipal elections scheduled next month in
southern Chiapas state will be canceled in eight Chiapas cities
that are struggling to recover from severe flooding.
	   The State Electoral Council announced late Thursday that it
would be impossible to set up polling stations and deliver election
documents for the Oct. 4 vote in three electoral districts along
the Pacific coast.
	   However, elections will be held in 21 other districts
representing 103 municipalities.
	   The flooding earlier this month swept away homes and entire
villages along the coastal mountain range and cut off roads and
bridges across the state. The government has confirmed 185 dead,
though church leaders estimate the toll could rise to more than
400.
	   The cancelation will affect some of the worst-hit cities:
Mapastepec, Pijijiapan, Acacoyagua, Escuintla, Huixtla,
Villacomaltitlan, Motozintla and Siltepec.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ An alleged drug-trafficker who survived a
massacre of his extended family has received a court injunction to
keep him from being taken out of the hospital where he is under
heavy military guard, newspapers reported Friday.
	   The order also protects Fermin Castro from possible arrest by
federal, state or city police.
	   Police believe Castro was the target of the Sept. 17 attack, in
which 18 children, women and men were gunned down at a ranch near
Ensenada, a popular resort city 50 miles south of the U.S. border.
	   Castro was shot in the head and remains in a coma at an Ensenada
hospital. His sister, who asserts Castro is a rancher not a
drug-trafficker, requested the court injunction.
	   The daily La Jornada newspaper reported Friday that a fourth
person _ a 17-year-old cousin of Castro's _ survived the massacre
by hiding in a mobile home at the ranch. Police previously had said
there were three survivors: Castro, a pregnant teen-age girl who
hid under a bed, and a boy who was wounded during the massacre.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Celebrated singer Vicente Fernandez says fear
will not drive him from Mexico even though his family was directly
hit by the nation's crimewave with the 4-month-long kidnapping of
his oldest son.
	   Fernandez, whose mariachi-backed ``ranchero'' songs epitomize
traditional Mexico, broke his silence about the ordeal in a
televised interview Thursday night.
	   ``I will not leave Mexico. If I sing ranchero I will live my
whole life in Mexico. I want that to be clear. From my country,
they will only take me out feet first,'' Fernandez told the
Televisa network.
	   Kidnappers seized the singer's 34-year-old son, Vicente
Fernandez Jr., on May 13 in Guadalajara, the Jalisco state capital
where the family lives. They released him earlier this month after
the family paid a ransom, reported at $3.2 million.
	   During his captivity, Vicente Jr. had two of his fingers cut off
by the kidnappers, whom he described as ``professionals.''
	   The elder Fernandez added, ``May God forgive them _ and
hopefully I'll never find out who they were.''

	   BAYE, France (AP) _ In the heart of the Brie region, some
cheese-lovers wouldn't think of eating the famous Brie of Meaux
before it hardens and turns black, well after its seventh month.
	   Others prefer it fresh out of fabrication, when it still has a
spongy center.
	   France has no rules for cheese-eating. It is the cheese-making
that follows the dictates of tradition.
	   Suited up in hospital-style gowns, caps and shoe covers, workers
and visitors can set foot into the production rooms at the
Fromagerie de la Brie (cheese factory) in Baye only after dipping
their blue plastic-covered feet into a vat filled with
disinfectant.
	   It is a laboratory image, yet it does nothing to violate
tradition. The factory has produced Brie, Coulommiers and other raw
milk cheese since 1939.
	   Arthur Balare, director of production, says French cheese dates
to ancient times.
	   ``We do know that in France it started with the Christian
civilization,'' he says. ``Afterward, the monks in the Savoie
region continued it, but cheese-making really dates back to the
dawn of time.''
	   Cheese was a way of preserving milk.
	   Because, in fact, cheese is nothing more than milk _ and a lot
of it. To make a 14-inch (35-centimeter) round of Brie, Balare uses
5 1/2 gallons (21 liters) of milk.
	   Cheese spends about a week in Balare's factory. Milk from local
cows is kept at its natural temperature and it is poured into large
tubs with a coagulating agent.
	   The cheese-makers then transfer the marble-sized balls of cheese
into forms. Next, the cheese is turned, salted and placed in a room
with a cooler temperature. Then it sits in a refrigerated room for
a week before going to the finisher, where it will spend four to
eight weeks.
	   For those who make this cheese, it is a lifestyle and an art.
	   Balare was born in Italy, but a trip to France introduced him to
French cheese 27 years ago.
	   ``The virus of the cheese took hold of me,'' he says. ``There is
such a history behind it, and its research has become a passion for
me. Cheese lives a passion.''
	   Pierre Bobin, the finisher who works with Balare, shares the
same gastronomic love. He left his banking job to follow in the
footsteps of his grandfather.
	   ``A bank is just money,'' Bobin says, surrounded by racks of
aging Brie, ``all of this, this is life.''
	   According to reference books, the average French person consumes
50 pounds (23 kilograms) of cheese a year.
	   ``Growing up, we were always used to eating it,'' says
Jean-Claude Besnard, a native of the Brie region. ``You develop a
palate for it. I appreciate every kind of cheese.''
	   Last year, tradition was threatened by the United States' call
for pasteurization of all exported cheese, but the discussion was
delayed until 1999.
	   Bobin says pasteurization would ruin the taste and threaten the
future of ancient cheese-making methods.
	   But the pasteurization argument obviously has not touched the
businesses of Balare and Bobin. Bobin finishes 600 tons of cheese
each year and sells hundreds of thousands of cheeses to the public.
He also exports to Canada.
	   Balare is a favorite among restaurant owners and has welcomed
orders from as far as Belgium.
	   He has some advice for novice shoppers. To choose a good Brie,
buy one that has the nearest ``sell by'' date; it is ready to eat.
	   But Balaresays that as it ages, it will get better and better.
Brie, in fact, never goes bad.
	   Despite the 24-hour, seven-day-week operation of the factory in
Baye, residents are not disturbed by noise or pungent odors.
	   ``We had some complaints about the smell a few years ago,''
Balare says. ``So we made some changes to contain it and now
there's no problem.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; IF YOU GO: The Fromagerie de la Brie is at Place Berthelot,
Baye, 51270 Montmort Lucy, about two hours east of Paris by car.
Telephone in advance for a tour. Contact: Arthur Balare, (0.11.33.)
03.26.52.80.44.
	   The finishing shop where Balare's cheese is aged and sold is at
19 Avenue Grand Morin, 77169 Saint Simeon. The shop is open on
Saturdays only, 9 a.m to noon.

The NATO allies walk down a new strategic road in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VILAMOURA, Portugal (AP) _ For the first time, the NATO allies
plan to take the offensive, readying bombers, missiles and warships
to strike at a European neighbor that, at best, poses a vague
threat to them.
	   The Kosovo crisis has dragged them into something new: they are
publicly planning for hostilities, rather than reacting to them.
	   During 45 Cold War years, NATO never said it would not be the
first to strike. Nor did it say it would be. It kept Moscow at bay
with the threat of massive retaliation to any attack, a strategy
that worked so well the allies were able to reap a huge ``peace
dividend'' when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989.
	   ``But that dividend has been paid out,'' Dutch Defense Minister
Frank de Grave said Friday after a two-day NATO defense ministers
meeting.
	   ``NATO cannot go on endlessly cashing in that dividend. The
world has not become a safer place. We still must invest in our
security.''
	   Against that backdrop, the allies are preparing for air strikes
on Yugoslavia unless President Slobodan Milosevic ends his attacks
on ethnic Albanians struggling for independence in Kosovo. If
necessary, NATO says it will attack with missiles and bombs,
gradually intensifying the assault until Milosevic halts his
offensive in Kosovo.
	   After months of contingency planning, NATO knows its way around
Yugoslavia. For one thing, sources say, military planners have
identified 600 surface-to-air missile sites across the country that
would be targeted and knocked out along with their command and
control centers.
	   Although allied air strikes helped end the Bosnian war, Kosovo
is different.
	   ``What we are really talking about here is a humanitarian
disaster precipitated by the cold political calculus of an
autocratic leader who has pursued a political strategy by military
means against his own citizens,'' said Gen. Wesley K. Clark,
supreme allied commander in Europe.
	   In Bosnia, NATO was a partner of the United Nations which passed
36 Security Council resolutions aimed at achieving peace.
	   NATO could have cited a half dozen of the resolutions to justify
military action, particularly to retaliate for Bosnian Serb attacks
against U.N. ``safe havens'' and to protect international
peacekeepers.
	   Milosevic threatens no NATO troops or U.N. peacekeepers and
considers Kosovo an internal matter. To him, the province was
Serbia's heartland in the Middle Ages and an integral part of the
Serbian state since the Serbs regained independence from the Turks
in 1878.
	   How then can NATO justify attacking a sovereign country that
does not threaten it?
	   The United States and Germany lead a camp that argues that by
bombing his own subjects, making almost 300,000 of them homeless
and turning hundreds of villages into ghost towns, Milosevic
undermines stability on NATO's eastern doorstep.
	   An allied attack, they say, is about defending Western values
and interests and NATO needs no formal approval for that from the
United Nations.
	   ``The United States believes that no authority from the Security
Council is necessary,'' Cohen told reporters here. ``The
credibility of NATO is on the line.''
	   France and others are less sure. French Defense Minister Alain
Richard, pressed by reporters, said: ``It would be irresponsible to
say what the next step is going to be.''
	   The United States is confident that, in the end, the allies
won't let themselves be hog-tied by the need to get U.N. blessing
for military action and thus run the risk of a Russian or Chinese
veto.
	   This debate does not end with Kosovo. Next April, NATO leaders
meet in Washington to approve a new overall post-Cold War strategic
concept, one that will deal with new security risks and challenges
just like the one the allies are facing from Belgrade today.

Memphis, Tennessee, wins second annual Great American Place Award
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The word is getting out that Memphis, the
birthplace of the blues and showplace of Elvis Presley, is indeed a
fine place to play.
	   American Heritage magazine has bestowed on Memphis its second
annual Great American Place Award and is featuring the old
Mississippi River port in its October issue.
	   The Great American Place Award honors a city or town
distinguished both as a historical site and as a travel
destination. The site is selected by editors of the magazine, based
on consultations with historians, travel writers and
preservationists.
	   The first award was presented last year to Saratoga Springs, New
York.

 &UR; Volunteers to spend their vacations working in West Africa
	   NEW ROCHELLE, New York (AP) _ More and more Americans are
leaving behind their beach chairs and sightseeing maps when they go
on vacation, opting to spend their free time helping others.
	   For example, Cross-Cultural Solutions, a non-profit organization
that developed a short-term volunteer program in India, has seen
its volunteer enrollment grow from 75 in the 1996-1997 fiscal year
to 142 volunteers in 1997-1998.
	   Steve Rosenthal, executive director of the organization, says
its part of a national trend. Taking advantage of that trend,
Cross-Cultural Solutions is launching a new program to Ghana in
West Africa in January 1999.
	   Volunteers will work for three weeks or more with local social
service pioneers in the villages around the town of Ho in the
eastern plains of Ghana. They will be involved in fields as diverse
as health care, education, skills training and arts and recreation.
	   The program fee of dlrs 1,850 includes lodging, meals,
orientation and professional support. Airfare is additional, but
Rosenthal says the program fee and airfare are tax-deductible for
U.S. residents.

 &UR; Exhibition to celebrate Day of the Dead in spooky Salem
	   SALEM, Massachusetts (AP) _ Colorful altars, brightly painted
skulls and papier-mache skeletons of all sizes will be on display
at the Peabody Essex Museum beginning next month.
	   The exhibition celebrates the art of the Mexican holiday, Dia De
Los Muertos, or Day of the Dead.
	   It will feature the works of local artist Alison Cann-Clift,
whose paintings and monotypes are inspired by the holiday, which
highlights death's place in everyday life. It combines
pre-Columbian traditions and Christian beliefs introduced by the
Spanish.
	   As part of the celebration, spirits are invited to return to
visit friends and family and eat their favorite foods, which are
set out on the altars, called offrendas.
	   The exhibition at the museum's Phillips Library, runs from Oct.
8 to Jan. 3. The museum is located at Salem's East India Square.

 &UR; Slain U.S. president's home reopened to public
	   MENTOR, Ohio (AP) _ James A. Garfield _ farmer, scholar, college
president, orator, soldier, congressman, lawyer and the 20th
president of the United States _ is showing off again.
	   After a four-year, dlrs 11.8 million renovation of the James A.
Garfield National Historic Site, the home where he led his famous
``front-porch campaign'' for the presidency in 1880 has been
restored to its Victorian grandeur and reopened to the public.
	   A tour should start at the visitor's center and its museum
exhibit in the former carriage house. Here you can learn about the
life of Garfield, from his youth as a farmer and Erie Canal
mule-team driver to his ascent to the presidency. A 20-minute film
shown in the room which once housed Garfield's horses is worth
watching.
	   Lawnfield, the grand gray and red main house, had humble
beginnings, not unlike its famous occupant.
	   The last president born in a log cabin and the first to have his
mother see him inaugurated, Garfield bought the nine-room farmhouse
near the shores of Lake Erie in 1876. To accommodate his wife,
Lucretia, and their five children, Garfield enveloped the original
house with 11 more rooms.
	   After his election to the presidency in 1880, and his death less
than a year later from an assassin's bullet at age 49, Lucretia
once again enlarged the house. Among other things she added a
library and vault, the predecessor to the presidential libraries so
popular today.
	   Garfield's desk from his nine terms as a U.S. congressman sits
in the library, as well as the floral wreath sent to his funeral by
England's Queen Victoria.
	   Garfield was shot just months after taking office by a
disgruntled job-seeker who'd been passed over for work in the White
House.

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ With polls predicting one of the tightest races in
postwar German history, Chancellor Helmut Kohl and challenger
Gerhard Schroeder both made final appeals to supporters to get out
and vote in Sunday's parliamentary election.
	   ``It's up to you now,'' Schroeder told an enthusiastic crowd of
8,000 at his campaign finale Friday night in Berlin, just before
the band struck up his team's theme song, ``Nothing's Gonna Stop Us
Now.''
	   Schroeder called Kohl ``the chancellor of unemployment,''
responsible for record double-digit joblessness, and said Sunday's
election was a choice between ``a new start or stagnation.''
	   In the Rhine River city of Mainz, Kohl also called the election
a pivotal one for Germany. But he saw it as a choice between
sticking with him and the safe ``politics of the middle,'' or a
swing to the radical left with Schroeder's Social Democrats.
	   ``There's still a lot to be done,'' he told 10,000 supporters in
the city's cathedral square. ``We need every vote.''
	   Both candidates, in fact, have targeted middle-of-the-road
voters in this election, with neither promising major changes in
German foreign or domestic policy if elected.
	   Kohl, who has served 16 years as chancellor and wants an
unprecedented fifth term, used the slogan ``stability instead of
risk'' to appeal to traditionally cautious Germans.
	   Schroeder sought to capitalize on the feeling among many Germans
that Kohl's center-right government is worn out. Campaigning as a
fresh face, his posters carry the simple slogan: ``Germany needs a
new chancellor.''
	   With unemployment topping 10 percent the central election issue,
both Kohl and Schroeder say they want to pare regulations blocking
innovation and sapping the German economy's competitiveness.
	   But Kohl is proposing a bigger tax cut than Schroeder, whose
campaign has stayed close to his party's liberal ideals despite his
business-friendly reputation.
	   Schroeder has tried to widen his appeal by giving few specifics
of what he would do. His few detailed plans involve repealing
modest cuts in social welfare and retirement programs that the Kohl
government has pushed through in the last four years.
	   Yet as Election Day nears, Schroeder has seen the 12-point lead
he held in the spring evaporate.
	   The Emnid polling institute put the parties within one
percentage point of each other Friday, too close to call: 39
percent for the Christian Democrats, 40 percent for the Social
Democrats.
	   About a quarter of Germans were still undecided, according to
the poll.

Gondola-like boats help fuel downtown revival

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ Boston is known for its swan boats, San Antonio
has the River Walk and trolleys climb the hills in San Francisco.
	   Now the Mile High City has its punts, those long and narrow
flat-bottomed boats propelled by a pole, similar to Venice's
gondolas.
	   ``Part of my dream is to make this creek a place to be,'' says
Warren Astler, manager of a boat ride attraction called Punt the
Creek, now in its third year on Cherry Creek in downtown Denver.
``It used to be the pits.''
	   A popular weekend activity in cities such as Cambridge and
Oxford in England, punting is not as well known in the United
States.
	   In the American version, up to four passengers sit in a 12-foot
(3.7-meter) long skiff while a Punt the Creek employee pushes it
down the creek with a long pole. Rides cost dlrs 7 for adults, dlrs
3.50 for children under 12, and dlrs 6 for seniors.
	   The punts depart every 10 minutes from a dock on Larimer Square,
a booming upscale shopping district in Lower Downtown (LoDo) that
features a Ruth's Chris steak house, a sushi restaurant, a Talbots
and a Ben and Jerry's ice cream shop, as well as a market
specializing in European foods. Coors Field, which opened in 1995,
is just six blocks away.
	   During the 45-minute punt ride, the pole pusher offers tidbits
of Denver's history, such as its founding in 1858 after prospectors
found gold in the creek.
	   The creek winds through the northwestern part of the city,
giving passengers a glimpse of Mile High Stadium, the Elitch
Gardens amusement park and some historic city buildings. The Rocky
Mountains loom to the west.
	   ``Last year we were in Venice, and now that we're in Denver, we
wanted to see what this was all about,'' said John Balink, a native
of Holland who used to work with his wife, Jenny, on a Holland
American Line cruise ship. ``You tend to think about mountains when
you come to Denver, not boating. This is something you wouldn't
expect.''
	   Bob Thompson, a retired upholstery worker, described the trip as
``perfect for finger dangling on a lazy Sunday afternoon.''
	   Joe Shoemaker, 74, a political heavyweight in Denver who served
as a state senator for three terms and ran for governor in 1978,
had long thought Cherry Creek could help revive the dirty warehouse
district in the lower downtown section of Denver.
	   He founded the Greenway Foundation in 1974, which works to
develop property along the creek. The non-profit group owns Punt
the Creek and is responsible for Confluence Park, where the creek
meets the Platte River.
	   While on a trip to Christchurch in New Zealand in 1987,
Shoemaker saw punting for the first time, took an hour-long ride on
the Avon River and thought it would work well in Denver.
	   ``It's been a lot of fun,'' he says. ``But with a lot of things
that are different, people think you're crazy.''
	   Back then, the creek was far too shallow to support the
fiberglass boats, which weigh about 250 pounds and need a foot (30
centimeters) of water to float safely.
	   So Shoemaker decided to make it deeper by building small dams on
the river and installing Colorado's only working locks so the boats
can navigate the creek.
	   He and his son, Jeff, who now runs the Greenway Foundation,
built three dams and two locks. By next year two dams and two more
locks will be built to extend the ride to Confluence Park, one mile
(1.6 kilometers) from downtown.
	   The project has already cost close to dlrs 4 million and will
cost another dlrs 600,000 before it's done. But more critical than
funding was getting approval to dam the creek. To win support, the
dams were designed to be raised and lowered in the event of a
flood.
	   Jeff Shoemaker says the punting business will support itself
within five years and will be profitable within 10. After that, he
hopes someone will buy it.
	   He said punting, unlike the River Walk in San Antonio, will not
be a reason that people come to Denver, but it will be something
fun to do while visiting.
	   ``I'd like to be able to say we'd be booking conventions in
Denver for Punt the Creek, but I think that's stretching it a
bit,'' he says.
	   ``It's just part of the things to do in Denver.''

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The panoramic view from a mountaintop generally
requires a long, hard hike up a steep trail with a heavy pack and
special equipment. It is a view generally reserved for the
adventurous and physically fit.
	   But for families on vacation there are a few mountains around
the country that can be climbed in the family station wagon and the
summit experience includes a hot dog and a souvenir T-shirt.
	   With the approach of autumn, these mountains can make an
especially memorable stop on a leaf-peeping tour.
	   Driving to mountaintops has been part of the American vacation
since the late 1800s when a carriage road was built up Pikes Peak
and Freelan O. Stanley of Stanley Steamer fame steamed up New
Hampshire's Mount Washington in his ``Locomobile.''
	   Now, Americans by the thousands are taking in the summit
experience on such mountains as Pikes Peak and Mount Evans in
Colorado, northern New York's Whiteface Mountain, North Carolina's
Mount Mitchell, and Maine's Cadillac Mountain, as well as windy
Mount Washington.
	   These mountains provide opportunities for aged grandparents and
restless youngsters to enjoy the spectacular views that otherwise
are reserved for hardy athletes.
	   They are the most played-on mountains in America.
	   The biggest is Mount Evans, at 14,130 feet (4,300 meters).
Billed as the highest paved road in the world, the road all the way
to the summit is clear some 40 days a year, mostly in July and
August. On Mount Evans, 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of Denver,
motorists can hope to see bighorn sheep, elk and goats among alpine
tundra and ancient bristlecone pines. But the road closed Labor Day
and won't reopen until Memorial Day.
	   Pikes Peak, just a few miles (kilometers) from downtown Colorado
Springs, is the most visited mountain with a road to the top. Some
500,000 people a year travel up the winding 19-mile-long
(30-kilometer-long) Pikes Peak Highway to the Rocky Mountain peak's
14,110-foot (4,300-meter) summit.
	   The 19-mile (30-kilometer) drive up the Pikes Peak Highway takes
an hour. After seven miles (11 kilometers), the paved road gives
way to gravel. Billed as the second-highest highway in the world,
it gains 6,710 feet (2,045 meters) in 19 miles (30 kilometers) with
a grade averaging 7 percent. Bad weather and altitude sickness is a
real consideration when making this trip. The Pikes Peak cog
railway has been making trips to the summit since 1891.
	   From the summit, tourists can take in an expansive view that
includes the Continental Divide, the Sangre De Cristo mountains,
Denver, Colorado Springs and New Mexico. This is the view that
inspired Katharine Lee Bates to compose ``America the Beautiful.''
In the autumn, the view is enhanced by the yellows and golds of the
countless aspens along the mountain's slopes.
	   At the summit, on a day when it is 90 degrees and humid down in
Colorado Springs, tourists will be wearing jackets and bracing
against a strong wind.
	   Tourists can relax from their drive up the mountain at The
Summit House, which has a gift shop and restaurant. Halfway up the
mountain, they can also stop in at the Glen Cove Inn.
	   In the East, motoring mountaineers have a variety of mountains
they can summit.
	   Mount Mitchell in North Carolina, at 6,684 feet (2,037 meters),
the highest mountain east of the Rockies, also has a paved road to
a summit restaurant and observation tower.
	   New Hampshire's Mount Washington, known for its high winds and
brutal storms, draws some 45,000 cars a year to its eight-mile
(13-kilometer) highway that dates to the 1860s.
	   Less than a day's drive from New York City and only two hours
from Montreal, Whiteface Mountain in northern New York attracts
some 83,000 tourists a year. At 4,867 feet (1,483 meters),
Whiteface is the fifth highest peak in the Adirondacks, rivaling
mile-high (1.6-kilometer-high) Mount Marcy and Algonquin for
panoramic views. Mount Marcy requires a 14-mile (23-kilometer)
round-trip hike. Algonquin is a steep eight miles (13 kilometers)
on foot.
	   On a clear day, a person on Whiteface can see Mount Royal to the
north in Canada, Lake Champlain and the Vermont Green Mountains to
the east, as well as the other Adirondack High Peaks to the south.
On the summit is a gift shop, restaurant and nature trail.
	   Maine's Cadillac Mountain in Acadia National Park provides a
mountaintop view of the Atlantic seacoast after a three-mile
(5-kilometer) drive that takes tourists from sea level up 1,530
feet (466 meters) to the highest point on the Atlantic Coast in the
United States.
	   Tourists have been driving to the Whiteface summit since the
highway was opened in 1935 by a wheelchair-bound President Franklin
Delano Roosevelt.
	   As governor of New York, Roosevelt, paralyzed by polio, turned
the first ceremonial spade of dirt for the construction in 1929 of
the Veterans Memorial Highway. Roosevelt returned as president on
July 20, 1935, to officially open the dlrs 1.2 million roadway.
	   An elevator takes tourists up the final 300 feet (90 meters)
from the parking lot.
	   All of these mountains have popular hiking trails. Mount
Washington, like Pike's Peak, also has a cog railroad taking
tourists to the summit. Unlike wilderness mountains that are only
accessible to climbers and hikers, these mountains are the sites
for grueling foot races, cycling races and even auto races.

	   Pikes Peak is open year round, depending on the weather.
	   The roads up Mount Washington and Whiteface Mountain are kept
open into mid-October for fall foliage viewing. Tourists driving up
Washington or Whiteface in the fall will be treated to an autumn
color explosion as the forests of poplar, maple and oak change
colors.
	   Winter comes early to the mountains, so tourists planning an
autumn drive up should schedule their trips in early fall. When it
is autumn in the big city, it can be mid-winter on the mountain.
	   These mountain highways can be a challenge for cars. The road up
Mount Washington averages a 12 percent incline for eight miles (13
kilometers). Tourists to Mount Washington have the option of
leaving the car at the bottom and taking a guided tour to the
summit by van. The service is also available to hikers who do not
want to walk down the mountain.
	   The Whiteface Veterans Memorial Highway twists and turns up the
steep mountain, climbing 3,400 feet (1,036 meters) over eight miles
(13 kilometers) with a grade averaging 8 percent. There are several
pullovers along the way for motorists to stop to savor the view or
give overheated engines a chance to cool.

UN Afghanistan envoy travels to Tehran, elsewhere
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. chief's special envoy for
Afghanistan will travel to Iran, Pakistan and elsewhere in the
region next week in an attempt to ease tensions between Iran and
Afghanistan's Taliban militia, a spokesman said Friday.
	   The envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, leaves Oct. 3 for Tehran, where he
is expected to spend several days, spokesman Fred Eckhard said. He
is also expected to visit Islamabad, but the rest of his agenda
hasn't been determined.
	   His trip was endorsed Monday by representatives of eight nations
who are following the situation in Afghanistan and met at the
United Nations on the sidelines of the General Assembly.
	   Iran, a powerful western neighbor of Afghanistan, deployed
roughly 200,000 troops on its Afghan frontier after the killing of
eight Iranian diplomats and a journalist by Taliban fighters when
it captured the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif in early August.
	   Tehran is demanding an apology from the Taliban, handing over of
the killers and an immediate release of an estimated 40 Iranians.
	   The Taliban blames renegade fighters for the killing of
Iranians, but has refused to hand them over to Iran, saying the
killers will be punished by its authorities. The Taliban currently
rule in 90 percent of the country and the opposition in the
remaining 10 percent.

Hakkinen wins round one, but Schumacher not worried
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous; will be UPDATED by 1400 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NUERBURGRING, Germany (AP) _ It couldn't get much closer than
this.
	   With two races left in the season, Mika Hakkinen and Michael
Schumacher are tied at 80 points, heading for a thrilling showdown.
	   Hakkinen, the ``Flying Finn,'' has a slight advantage: since he
has two second-place finishes and Schumacher only one, Hakkinen is
theoretically ahead in the tie-breaking formula.
	   The Finn can clinch his first title in Sunday's Luxembourg Grand
Prix _ provided he wins and Schumacher either fails to finish the
race or ends up outside the top six.
	   The way the season started, Hakkinen should have by now all but
clinched the title.
	   He won the first race in Austria in March to take the lead in
the drivers' standings and he's been in No. 1 ever since, capturing
four of the first six races and six overall.
	   But Schumacher has come back strongly in his attempt to win the
first drivers' title for Ferrari since Jody Scheckter in 1979.
	   The German also has six season victories and comes off an
impressive win at Monza, Italy, two weeks ago, his second in the
last three races.
	   Schumacher feels Hakkinen should be under pressure. While
Hakkinen has never won the title, Schumacher has twice, with
Williams and Benetton, but not with Ferrari.
	   While the McLaren-Mercedes cars won five of the first six races
this year, it is the Ferraris that have been gaining in reliability
while the McLarens have been losing it.
	   In Monza, Hakkinen suffered brake problems while his teammate
David Coulthard went out with engine problems. Schumacher won and
his teammate Eddie Irvine finished second.
	   ``I am confident that we've got it under control,'' said
Mercedes boss Norbert Haug.
	   Hakkinen showed off the McLaren's power by beating Schumacher by
more than seven-tenths of a second in Friday's free practice.
	   Schumacher, who had the fourth fastest time, wasn't worried.
	   ``The McLaren looks strong, as expected, but I am not concerned
about the time difference as I only used one set of tires,'' said
Schumacher said, who won on this circuit in 1995.
	   Hakkinen agreed it was likely to be a different story in
Saturday's qualifying.
	   ``We made changes all the way through the sessions today,
finally establishing a good set-up for the race,'' Hakkinen said.
``Qualifying will be very close.''
	   Although the race officially carries the title of Luxembourg
Grand Prix, it takes place across the border in Germany.

Labor annual conference: an ad for leftist politics and businesss
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ At home, the political honeymoon is cooling and
from abroad some chill economic winds are blowing. But after nearly
18 months in power, Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor Party
government opens its annual conference Sunday in good shape _ and a
fine ad for the blending of left-of-center politics and business.
	   Security passes worn by the several thousand delegates are
dotted with the name of a supermarket chain, Somerfield, which paid
20,000 pounds (dlrs 34,000) to sponsor them.
	   A toy store has its ads at the creche. Other chain stores are
sponsoring receptions and debates in the fringes of the six-day
convention in Blackpool, a north England seaside town.
	   It reflects what Blair, in a statement of political philosophy
launched during an appearance with U.S. President Bill Clinton at a
seminar in New York Sept. 21, calls ``The Third Way.''
	   ``With the right policies ... entrepreneurial zeal can promote
social justice, and new technology represents an opportunity, not a
threat,'' said Blair of his path between socialism and capitalism.
	   It is all part of what the party's restive left-wing derides as
the ditching of socialism by ``New Labor'' in favor of
presentation, slickness and focus groups funded by glamorous, new
Establishment supporters, including soccer club managers and pop
stars.
	   In Blackpool, the left-wing scents the beginning of a comeback.
It hopes to capture most of the six places chosen by the party's
400,000 members for Labor's 32-member governing body, the National
Executive Committee.
	   Even if the leftists, standing on a joint ticket called
Grassroots Alliance, do well, the executive committee will remain
controlled by Blair supporters, some appointed by him, some elected
by the trade unions _ still a major funder of the party _ and
lawmakers. The results of the pre-conference ballots will be
announced Wednesday.
	   Success for the Grassroots Alliance would mark the first setback
for Blair from within the party that he led to a crushing victory
over the Conservative Party in May 1997, ending 18 years out of
office.
	   ``We are united by our commitments to ... the redistribution of
wealth and power from rich to poor,'' said Liz Davies, a member of
the Grassroots slate.
	   Ms. Davies was barred by party headquarters from running for
Parliament in 1997 although she had won the nomination for a
traditionally Labor north England district, Leeds Northeast.
	   Patrick Dunleavy, professor of government at the London School
of Economics, says that a key task for Blair in Blackpool is to try
to lessen the sense of alienation felt by Labor's blue-collar
supporters.
	   ``To win, Labor had to appeal to middle-class voters. Now it's
working-class voters who sit on their hands,'' said Dunleavy,
pointing to exceptionally low voter turnouts in local government
elections in working-class districts in the past year.
	   ``Some people are beginning to worry that the Labor government
is facing a turnout time bomb,'' he added.
	   Next year there are a clutch of elections _ new assemblies in
Scotland and Wales, local authorities and the European Parliament.
	   For now Labor looks unchallenged _ with just over 50 percent
support in most opinion polls. But Blair's personal ratings are
falling, with fewer people seeing him as more honest or
understanding than other politicians.

	   ROMAGNE-SOUS-MONTFAUCON, France (AP) _ America's largest
cemetery in Europe is ground zero of the fiercest battles the young
``Doughboys'' fought 80 years ago in what they thought was the war
to end all wars.
	   On Saturday, French and American officials at the cemetery were
to mark the commemoration U.S. veterans of World War I are now too
old to attend, but which they hope to keep alive as a symbol
against war.
	   Sept. 26, 1998, marked 80 years since U.S. and French forces
launched the Meuse-Argonne offensive, the largest of the U.S. war
effort that totaled 1.2 million soldiers. More than 116,000
Americans died in the war.
	   U.S. Army Secretary Louis Caldera and U.S. Veteran Affairs
Secretary Togo West Jr. were to join French Veterans Minister
Jean-Pierre Masseret in laying wreaths at the Meuse-Argonne
American Cemetery.
	   A flock of carrier pigeons, honoring those used in the war,
would be released, and soldiers would fire gun salvos to salute the
buried.
	   With 14,246 graves, the cemetery in eastern France lies on the
German battle lines that Americans like Corp. Albert Thomas, an
infantryman then in his early 20s, was sent to bust through the
Hindenberg Line.
	   Thomas, now 102 and living in Fostoria, Ohio, remembers the
constant roar of cannons and machine guns, around the clock.
	   ``At night, we had patrols between our line and the enemy line,
the no-man's land. They had barbed wire strung all through there,''
Thomas said in a telephone interview. ``The Germans would send up
little flares.''
	   Fear was something you just lived with, said the retired
chemical and railroad worker. ``There was nothing you could do
about it. We were there, and we had no choice.''
	   Thomas, his 17-year-old brother Charles and other recruits had
about three months of training in Alabama before they were sent to
the front with the Buckeye Division.
	   ``We didn't have too much training,'' he said. ``We just did the
best we could.''
	   After being elected on a peace platform, President Woodrow
Wilson was suddenly pressed into war in 1917. German U-boats, the
sinking of the Lusitania and the Zimmerman telegram that courted
Mexican support for Germany helped jar Americans out of
isolationism.
	   As a result, U.S. involvement began with hundreds of thousands
of barely trained troops like Thomas.
	   ``These were young kids with a tiny leavening of army guys,''
said Col. Peter Herrly, a U.S. military attache at the U.S. Embassy
in Paris. ``They were in the middle of the toughest defenses the
Germans had constructed.''
	   The Germans ``had three years to perfect that, with concrete
bunkers, barbed wire, and cross-fire. It was like Omaha Beach''
during the D-Day, he said.
	   By all accounts, the U.S. involvement was pivotal in the war,
especially after German troops were rushed to the Western Front
when the Russian front collapsed in the 1917 Bolshevik revolution.
	   ``Regardless of French pride, you can't avoid saying that
without the Americans, the Franco-British force would have been
beaten,'' said French historian Jean-Jacques Becker.
	   But after the war, the U.S. Congress rejected the war's
Versailles Treaty and refused to join the League of Nations as
Wilson wished. GIs had to go back 23 years later to fight the
Nazis.
	   ``America had a world responsibility after 1918,'' said
Jean-Noel Jeanneney, a history professor at the Institute for
Political Studies and a former trade minister. ``It resigned it,
and that was very bad, historically speaking.''

Thailand: Industrial nations must control global economic crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Industrialized countries, which stand to
lose the most if there is a retreat from a global economy, have an
obligation to help contain the spreading economic crisis,
Thailand's foreign minister said.
	   Since the financial crisis began in Thailand a year ago,
``Thailand and a growing number of countries have been penalized by
the global financial markets,'' Surin Pitsuwan told the U.N.
General Assembly on Friday.
	   ``At this point, it seems clear that the severity of the crisis
has been all out of proportion to the severity of our mistakes. The
crisis is no longer an Asian crisis, but a global crisis and a
systemic crisis,'' he said.
	   ``The perception that this will stop at a certain point _ at
Thailand, at Indonesia, at South Korea _ has time and again proven
wrong,'' Surin said.
	   With the world ``teetering on the brink of global recession,''
he said the seven major industrialized nations ``by acting to check
the financial crisis will not be performing an act of charity but
one of self-preservation.''
	   ``They stand to gain the most from globalization and lose the
most from a worldwide retreat from it,'' he said.
	   The world's seven richest nations _ the United States, Britain,
France, Japan, Germany, Italy and Canada _ have embarked on an
overhaul of global economic management and supported International
Monetary Fund bailouts for some countries hard-hit by the crisis.
	   Surin backed growing calls from the international community ``to
come up with a mechanism or framework entrusted with the global
monitoring and regulation of international financial flows.''
	   The United Nations should propose a world conference on the
world financial system ``to be held in the very near future,'' he
said.
	   While tackling economic reform, the Thai minister urged the
international community to pay greater attention to the human and
social costs of the economic turmoil.
	   ``In Southeast Asia, the economic crisis has given momentum to
the struggle for democracy and human rights,'' he said. ``It may
well be that democracy and human rights will gain ground as a
result, but there is also a lurking danger that governments will
respond harshly and reverse any progress made.''
	   In Cambodia, for example, a fragile democracy is trying to take
root but ``continuing factionalism threatens to unravel the peace
and stability which took so many years to build,'' Surin said.
	   He called for compromise among political leaders, ``if only for
the sake of the country's long-suffering people,'' and urged the
international community which has spent so much time and money
trying to promote democracy in Cambodia not to turn its attention
elsewhere.

Heatherington leads Betsy King Classic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUTZTOWN, Pennsylvania (AP) _ Rachel Heatherington played well
through a series of steady and torrential rains that slowed most of
the players in the Betsy King Classic on Friday and took her first
lead ever after a round of an LPGA event.
	   Heatherington was one stroke shy of the course record at the
Berkleigh Country Club with a 6-under-par 66 Friday. Her 36-hole
total of 135 was one stroke ahead of Beth Daniel.
	   ``The rains might have slowed up the rest of the field, but it
didn't seem to affect me,'' said Heatherington, a 36-year-old
native of Australia who is in her second year on the U.S. tour. ``I
got a good start and that helped.''
	   She started the round on the back nine and three birdies kept
her in contention with co-leaders Daniel and Deb Richard.
Heatherington, who has two international wins to her credit, had an
eagle on No. 16 to pull even with Daniel at eight under.
	   Heatherington, whose best finish last year was a tie for fifth,
continued the pace on the front nine with a birdie on No. 8, her
fifth of the round.
	   Daniel, who had a second-round 69, finished strong with four
birdies over the last eight holes.
	   ``I started out a little shaky, but then I settled down after
that,'' said Daniel, who is seeking her first victory this year and
33rd of her career. ``I hung in there and it paid off.''
	   Despite steady rains throughout the afternoon, Charlotta
Sorenstam and Juli Inkster each came with their second straight 69
to stay within striking distance at 6-under 138. Cathy
Johnston-Forbes shot a 70 and was also at 138.
	   Two-time defending champion Annika Sorenstam picked up the pace
with a 69 after an opening-round 71. Richard struggled to a 74 and
was at 141.
	   Moira Dunn's 67 was second only to Heatherington's round Friday
and she was at 142.

Israeli mission optimistic about West Bank pullback

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Yasser Arafat, previewing what he is
expected to tell world leaders at the United nations on Monday, has
reiterated plans to declare a Palestinian state in May despite
Israeli objections.
	   Just Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned
that a unilateral statehood declaration would lead to a ``complete
collapse'' of Mideast peacemaking.
	   The Palestinian leader's comments, during a Friday stopover in
Belgium on his way to New York, came while efforts were being made
to close a deal on a West Bank troop withdrawal. In a briefing with
Israeli reporters in New York, Netanyahu formally confirmed for the
first time that he was ready to accept a U.S. proposal to withdraw
from 13 percent of the West Bank. Agreement, Israeli officials
said, could be a few weeks away.
	   Until now, only Netanyahu's aides have said Israel was willing
to accept the U.S. proposal, with some strings attached.
	   Arafat said he would prefer a negotiated settlement with Israel
by May 4, the deadline set in the Oslo peace accords for a final
agreement. But after that date, he said he would make use of his
``sacred right'' to declare statehood in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
	   ``We will look with hope and trust to our friends and
peace-loving nations of the international community to support the
Palestinian people in their declaration of an independent state on
May 4, 1999,'' he said in a Liege, Belgium, speech distributed by
the Palestinian news agency Wafa.
	   Netanyahu told Associated Press Television News on Friday that a
unilateral declaration is worrisome because ``if you say a state, a
state has all the powers.'' Limits first must be defined, he said.
	   ``Essentially, I believe they should have all the power to
govern themselves and none of the powers to threaten us _ and
that's a balance that can only be struck by sitting down opposite
one another,'' he said.
	   Addressing Israeli fears, Arafat also said the state would seek
peaceful relations with its neighbors and would not react to
provocations unless its security or vital interests were harmed.
	   In Israel, Arafat's call prompted demands that Netanyahu break
off the troop withdrawal negotiations. Two Israeli Cabinet
ministers, Shaul Yahalom and Rafael Eitan, also said that if Arafat
declares statehood, Israel must annex areas of the West Bank and
Gaza still under its control.
	   The United States has been trying to persuade the Palestinians
to delay a declaration of statehood. Palestinian and U.S. officials
close to the talks on a West Bank troop withdrawal confirmed in
Jerusalem that the issue has come up as a bargaining chip.
	   Israeli officials in New York, meanwhile, said a deal on a
long-awaited West Bank troop pullback is possible within two or
three weeks.
	   A meeting with Arafat, Netanyahu and President Clinton was being
considered for next week in Washington, but the Israeli prime
minister told APTN that he was ``not sure we're ready for a
three-way meeting.''
	   Palestinian willingness to discuss making part of the land a
nature reserve is the reason for the optimism, Israeli officials in
New York told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
	   Shivi Isman, spokeswoman for Israel's U.N. ambassador Dore Gold,
would say only that Israel is ``very hopeful,'' and that what is
needed now is Palestinian cooperation.
	   ``We feel that there's an opportunity here. We're trying to get
to an agreement in the next few weeks,'' Isman said.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright conveyed to Netanyahu
on Wednesday the Palestinian willingness to consider a nature
reserve, the officials said.
	   Netanyahu told APTN that neither side would be able to build on
the nature reserve, which would amount to 3 percent of the 13
percent under discussion. ``We could be assured they don't build
there, they could be assured that we don't build there. That's a
very good concept,'' he said.
	   Israel has complete authority over one-third of Gaza and 70
percent of the West Bank.

<TEXT>
	   SAN ANTONIO (AP) _ A three-week vacation is paying off for
Justin Leonard. He's rested, relaxed and tied for the lead of the
Texas Open.
	   Leonard recouped from some bad early shots and made five birdies
Friday on the way to a second straight 5-under-par 67. His 10-under
134 total matched that of John Maginnes, who usually plays on the
Nike Tour.
	   Loren Roberts, Bob Estes, Hal Sutton and Brad Fabel were one
stroke behind the leaders after two rounds. David Frost and Tommy
Armour III were another stroke back.
	   Playing his first tournament since late August, Leonard _ No. 8
on the money list with dlrs 1.27 million _ didn't seem to feel any
ill effects from his time away from the golf course.
	   ``It's one of the first times I've really been able in the
middle of the season to put my clubs down and not worry about it,''
Leonard said. ``It's nice to be back here playing, especially to
come back and play well.''
	   The winner of the dlrs 1.7 million tournament, which is
sponsored by Westin and played at LaCantera Golf Club, receives
dlrs 306,000.
	   Fabel made the jump to the group tied for third with a 64, while
Estes had a 67 and Roberts and Sutton had 68s. Frost got to 136
with a 64, while Armour had a 67.
	   Leonard began the day in a pack of 10 players two strokes behind
first-round leader D.A. Weibring. Starting on the back nine,
Leonard got his first birdie on the par-4 11th when he made a
12-foot (3.6-meter) putt.
	   The 14th, 15th and 16th holes proved tricky, as Leonard hit the
ball off the fairway repeatedly. But he managed to par each hole
then made a birdie from a foot on the par-4 18th.
	   ``I had time to recover,'' Leonard said of his poor early shots.
``It's not always bad to hit a couple of shots like that during a
round because it kind of woke me up.''
	   Leonard birdied No. 1 by making another 12-footer (3.6 meters)
and wrapped up his bogey-free round with birdies on the last two
holes.
	   Maginnes, playing under a sponsor's exemption, also started the
day two strokes behind the leader and shot a 67.
	   ``I'm pretty encouraged. Somebody's got to win this golf
tournament,'' said Maginnes, delighting in the prospect of a
possible pairing with Leonard this weekend. ``It'll be fun. ...
It'll probably take the gallery seven or eight holes to figure out
who I am.''
	   Maginnes also started on the par-5 10th and made a putt for his
first birdie. He got four more birdies before the turn. He bogeyed
the par-4 No. 2 after hitting into a bunker, then two-putted on the
par-5 5th for a birdie.
	   Another bogey on No. 6 then a birdie on No. 7 left Maginnes at
10 under for the round.
	   ``I played as well as I can play. It wasn't an easy one,''
Maginnes said.
	   Weibring shot a 74 Friday and was at 139.
	   Eighty players at 2-under 142 or lower made the cut. Defending
champion Tim Herron shot a 73 and missed by one stroke.
	   U.S. Amateur champion Hank Kuehne, after blowing his otherwise
respectable first round on the second-to-last hole Thursday, shot
an even-par 72 Friday for a 149 total.

U.S. Embassy in Liberia airlifts former warlord away

	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ Under the watch of dozens of highly
armed soldiers, a helicopter swooped into the U.S. Embassy
compound, airlifting out a former Liberian warlord and ending a
seven-day standoff.
	   Roosevelt Johnson dashed toward the cliffside helipad Friday
afternoon as the first of two helicopters flew in from the ocean
and dropped over the barbed-wire fence. A handful of supporters
followed him, and more took off moments later in a second
helicopter.
	   It was over in less than five minutes, and Johnson was on his
way to neighboring Sierra Leone, embassy officials said, from there
to be transferred to a third country.
	   The helicopters _ owned by an American military contractor,
piloted by Russians and arranged through the Nigerian-led
peacekeeping force that patrols Liberia _ picked up a total of 28
people, including two of Johnson's sons and two close aides.
	   The remaining 23 people were Johnson supporters who sneaked into
the embassy grounds last week during a government operation to
arrest the former warlord.
	   Johnson's evacuation from Liberia came after days of
negotiations between U.S. officials in Washington and the
government of President Charles Taylor.
	   Taylor had earlier demanded the United States hand over Johnson
_ his main rival _ but the president's spokesman said Thursday that
there would be no effort to block Johnson's evacuation.
	   Johnson fled to the embassy last weekend during gunbattles
between his supporters and government forces seeking to arrest him.
As he was trying to convince embassy officials to harbor him,
Liberian commandoes opened fire on his group, witnesses say,
killing at least three of his supporters and injuring two American
security officers.
	   Johnson and four others pushed their way into the embassy during
the gunbattle, forcing American diplomats to reluctantly protect
him.
	   Fearing more fighting, security was greatly increased at the
embassy and most diplomats were evacuated. U.S. military
reinforcements were sent in to help shore up the embassy's
defenses, machinegun nests were set up on the roof and diplomats
seldom moved without flak jackets and helmets.
	   The American diplomats _ who have seen themselves as living
under siege for a week _ were happy to see him go.
	   ``I'm glad this is over,'' Deputy Chief of Mission John Bauman
said, his flak jacket flung over his office chair.
	   Johnson will eventually be taken to either Nigeria or Ghana,
local newspapers reported. Quoting Liberian officials, the
newspapers said an agreement to allow Johnson to leave stipulated
that he would be tried in absentia and returned to Liberia if found
guilty.
	   Longtime rivals, Taylor and Johnson headed opposing factions
during Liberia's brutal seven-year civil war, which ended in 1996.
	   While the two men ostensibly made peace after Taylor was elected
president last year, Johnson's supporters and government soldiers
have repeatedly clashed over the past few months.
	   On Friday, Taylor was again declaring victory.
	   ``It is not my victory, it is not your victory, it is not the
victory of the security forces, it is the lord's victory,'' he told
a gathering of church choirs.

Chile curbs public spending in wake of Asian crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ President Eduardo Frei on Friday said
Chile's public spending will grow by only 2.8 percent in 1999
instead of the 4.1 percent originally planned.
	   Officials said it was a result of the financial turmoil in Asia.
	   In a speech on national radio and television, Frei said that the
budget bill he will submit to Congress next week will favor social
spending and will emphasize ``investments that are job-creating.''
	   The budgets for sectors such as health, housing, education and
social security will take precedence, he said.
	   Frei explained that the real growth of public spending will be
1.5 percent, as the total figure of 2.8 percent includes an already
approved increase in pensions for retired government workers.
	   He gave no actual figures, but Chile's national budget totaled
dlrs 21 billions last year.
	   The impact of the Asian crisis ``has already made Chile poorer
by the equivalent to dlrs 1.6 billion,'' Frei said.
	   He urged the private sector to also control the growth of its
spending, which accounts for 80 per cent of total national
spending.
	   Despite of the difficulties, Frei said, the Chilean economy will
grow by around 5 percent this year and will post ``a reasonable
growth rate'' in 1999. The economy grew by 7.3 percent last year.

peacekeeping force that patrols Liberia _ picked up a total of 28
people, including two of Johnson's sons and two close aides.
	   The remaining 23 people were Johnson supporters who sneaked into
the embassy grounds last week during a government operation to
arrest the former warlord.
	   Johnson's evacuation from Liberia came after days of
negotiations between U.S. officials in Washington and the
government of President Charles Taylor.
	   Taylor had earlier demanded the United States hand over Johnson
_ his main rival _ but the president's spokesman said Thursday that
there would be no effort to block Johnson's evacuation. Johnson,
along with 21 other people, has been charged with treason after
being accused of trying to overthrow Taylor.

	   MATAMAMON, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Hundreds of people swarmed
onto the first military helicopter in three days to deliver aid to
this village which Hurricane Georges turned into an island.
	   The three soldiers on board kicked people away and frantically
took off again, hovering 30 feet above ground as they tossed boxes
of food to hundreds of upwardly stretched hands.
	   Matamamon is one of what officials say are hundreds of villages
completely cut off by swollen rivers, downed bridges, and mudslides
in Hurricane Georges' devastating path across the Dominican
Republic, where it killed more than 300. Some have become little
islands surrounded by miles of swamp.
	   Increasingly desperate, people resorted to drinking fetid river
water. The United States and France sent help Friday for Dominican
authorities who are overwhelmed by the population's needs.
	   Rescue teams in two rowboats carried supplies, passing one
island where a Labrador retriever was stranded, another where
cattle stood. In Yabacao, about 100 people were stranded on an
island the size of a football field.
	   The flooded river stretched three miles (4.5 kilometers) wide
around Yabacao and was 11 miles (18 kilometers) wide further
upstream.
	   Navy Capt. Lombardo Baez Pimentel said about 45 people had been
rescued from Yabacao, but the rest asked the military to bring them
supplies and they would remain.
	   In addition to the severe shortage of drinking water, food
supplies were dwindling. Georges' winds destroyed 90 percent of the
nation's food crops.
	   ``In the shelters people are hungry, thirsty and in bad
conditions sanitary-wise. The food stocks will be used up pretty
quickly,'' said Rodger Garner, a program officer for the U.S.
Agency for International Development.
	   A U.S. Air Force C-130 cargo plane landed in Santo Domingo with
enough plastic tarpaulins to roof 2,000 houses. Sixty-three search
and rescue firefighters from New York City and search dogs were
being flown in.
	   A French C-130 also delivered disaster specialists, food and
medical aid.
	   Georges' Caribbean death toll soared past 300, with at least 210
dead in the Dominican Republic, 87 in Haiti, three in Puerto Rico,
three in St. Kitts, two in Antigua and four in Cuba.
	   Georges hit especially hard in Hispaniola, an impoverished
island of 15 million shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic.
Substandard housing couldn't stand up to storm winds and flooding.
Most deaths were due to flooding.
	   Shelters opened in Santo Domingo only as the storm was hitting
Tuesday, while in Haiti, the Western Hemisphere's poorest nation,
denuded mountains and unmaintained drainage systems were blamed for
widespread flooding.
	   Santo Domingo newspapers accused the government Friday of
failing to warn the public how dangerous the storm was. ``The
emergency committee hid the severity of Hurricane Georges,'' read
Listin Diario's front-page headline.
	   National Palace spokesman Adriano Miguel Tejada defended the
government's efforts and said everything possible was being done to
help the estimated 100,000 homeless.
	   Throughout the capital, thousands of people stood in block-long
lines for water and many filled their jugs from the brown,
debris-filled Ozama River.
	   ``There's no water. There's no power. There is nothing,'' said
Domingo Osvaldo Fortuna, 51, as he filled a jug with river water.
Asked whether he was worried about disease, Osvaldo angrily
replied: ``Of course.''

Two dead, eight injured in gas refinery explosions

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Victoria state is fast running out
of natural gas Saturday following a massive fire that killed two
workers at the Esso gas plant and injured eight.
	   The plant at Sale about 110 miles (180 km) east of Melbourne
supplies 80 percent of Victoria's gas.
	   It was still shut down as firefighters continued to fight a
massive blaze that broke out at 12:30 p.m. Friday.
	   Police and Esso confirmed Saturday that two workers died in the
explosion and eight others were injured.
	   One man is in a serious condition at Melbourne's Alfred Hospital
where he has undergone over six hours of surgery.
	   A hospital spokeswoman said the man suffered severe bone
injuries which surgeons had been able to fix, and extensive burns.
	   Firefighters were working in cooperation with Esso employees
Saturday to cool down equipment so gas supply valves could be shut
down.
	   Esso said it was too early to forecast when any moves would be
made to again begin gas production.
	   Victoria's gas supply authority VENCorp has invoked emergency
laws, ordering all industry and home owners to stop using gas to
maintain supplies -- although pilot lights should be kept alight.
	   As Victoria state runs out of gas, no non-essential gas
consumers are exempt, including restaurants, hotels and bakeries.
The ban also covers heaters, hot water systems and stoves.
	   Under emergency powers invoked by the state government, people
who use gas appliances are subject to a 500 Australian dollars
(U.S. dlrs 290) penalty for the first offense and 100 Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 58) for each repeated offense, he said.
	   ``Penalties apply if people ignore these instructions, as there
in only enough gas for hospitals, and aged and infirm residential
homes,'' VENCorp spokesman David Guthrie-Jones said.

Sosa hits No. 66, passes McGwire
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK BABINECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ Sammy Sosa hit his record 66th home run Friday
night, moving ahead of Mark McGwire for only the second time this
season when he connected in the Chicago Cubs' game at Houston.
	   Facing friend and fellow Dominican Jose Lima, Sosa lined an 0-1
pitch into the third deck in left-center field to lead off the
fourth inning.
	   His 462-foot (139-meter) shot was his fourth in nine games
against the Astros, and his third against Lima, who yielded Nos. 50
and 51 at Wrigley Field on Aug. 23.
	   Following Sosa's two-homer game off Lima, there was a published
report questioning whether Lima grooved a pitch for the Cubs star.
Both players denied the allegation.
	   Sosa has been ahead of McGwire in the home-run chase just once
this season. On Aug. 19, Sosa hit No. 48 in a game against St.
Louis _ about an hour later, McGwire also hit his 48th and the
Cardinals slugger connected later in the game to take the lead.
	   Sosa tied McGwire at 65 with two home runs Wednesday at
Milwaukee, snapping his 0-for-21 slump.
	   Both Sosa, whose Cubs were tied for the NL wild-card lead, and
McGwire began Friday with three games left.
	   About a minute after Sosa hit No. 66, his revised total was
posted on a scoreboard at Busch Stadium in St. Louis. Fans there
watching McGwire play against Montreal mostly booed the update.
	   Sosa's homer allowed the Cubs to tie the Astros at 2-2. Chicago
was tied with the New York Mets and one game ahead of the San
Francisco Giants in the race for the NL's last playoff spot.
	   The packed Astrodome cheered loudly as Sosa rounded the bases,
flashbulbs popping. He acknowledged fans with a curtain call.
	   Before the game, Sosa admitted he was playing with a heavy heart
having heard details of the destruction in the Dominican Republic
caused by Hurricane Georges. His charitable foundation is
organizing an emergency relief effort.
	   ``The president (Leonel Fernandez) called me and explained what
has happened,'' Sosa said. ``He told me to go out and play the
games, because this is my job and I'm here to do it, no matter
what.''

Two dead, eight injured in gas refinery explosions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Victoria state was fast running out
of natural gas Saturday following a massive fire that killed two
workers at the Esso gas plant and injured eight.
	   The plant at Sale about 110 miles (180 km) east of Melbourne
supplies 80 percent of Victoria's gas. It was still shut down as
firefighters continued to fight a massive blaze that broke out
Friday afternoon.
	   Police and Esso on Saturday confirmed the deaths and injuries.
One man is in a serious condition at Melbourne's Alfred Hospital
where he has undergone over six hours of surgery.
	   A hospital spokeswoman said the man suffered severe bone
injuries which surgeons had been able to fix, and extensive burns.
	   Firefighters were working in cooperation with Esso employees
Saturday to cool down equipment so gas supply valves could be shut
down.
	   Esso said it was too early to forecast when any moves would be
made to resume gas production.
	   Victoria's gas supply authority VENCorp has invoked emergency
laws, ordering all industry and home owners to stop using gas to
maintain supplies.
	   As Victoria state runs out of gas, no non-essential gas
consumers are exempt, including restaurants, hotels and bakeries.
The ban also covers heaters, hot water systems and stoves.
	   Under emergency powers invoked by the state government, people
who use gas appliances are subject to a 500 Australian dollars
(U.S. dlrs 290) penalty for the first offense and 100 Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 58) for each repeated offense, he said.
	   ``Penalties apply if people ignore these instructions, as there
in only enough gas for hospitals, and aged and infirm residential
homes,'' VENCorp spokesman David Guthrie-Jones said.

Islanders game canceled after negotiators fail to reach agreement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINEOLA, New York (AP) _ A face-off between the New York
Islanders hockey team and Nassau County officials ended Friday with
a slap shot to fans when the team canceled its first home
exhibition game over allegations its home arena is unsafe.
	   The Islander's game against the New Jersey Devils was canceled
when both sides in the dispute were unable to come to an agreement
about allowing an engineering firm hired by the National Hockey
League to conduct a safety inspection of the 26-year-old Nassau
Coliseum.
	   State Supreme Court Justice Burton Joseph issued a gag order
Friday, preventing negotiators who attended a closed-door meeting
in the judge's chambers from discussing the case.
	   NHL commissioner Gary Bettman, who attended the meeting, said he
was optimistic about the possibility of the Islanders playing in
the Coliseum in the near future.
	   The judge has ordered all parties to return to court Monday at
11:30 a.m. to try to solve the standoff.
	   Islanders fans weren't so sure the problem could be solved.
	   ``I get the feeling we are never going to get to see another
game in this Coliseum,'' said Jean Nebiosini, an Islanders
ticketholder for 26 years. ``I feel somebody wants out of their
contract.''
	   The Islanders say the Coliseum is falling apart, citing an
engineering report showing the hoist system for the scoreboard is
unsafe.
	   The Islanders earlier this month filed a federal lawsuit against
the Philadelphia-based SMG, formerly the Spectacor Management
Group, saying the arena was unsafe.
	   The team is seeking at least dlrs 10 million in damages and a
release from its lease. It also closed its Nassau County offices
and moved to Manhattan.
	   But lawyers for SMG have said the problem with the scoreboard
had been fixed and the team was just trying to get out of its lease
to play at the Coliseum.
	   Last week, Joseph issued a temporary restraining order barring
the team from playing home games anywhere but at the Coliseum.
	   Joseph then ruled that an engineering firm hired by the NHL
should conduct a safety inspection of the Coliseum. But the
inspection was suspended following a disagreement over which areas
the NHL engineer could view.
	   The Islanders, hoping to build a new arena within the next three
years on the site of the Coliseum, have played at the arena since
1972. Their lease runs through 2015.

Kuwait calls for continued international pressure on Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to update with response from Iraq &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Kuwait's foreign minister called for
continued international pressure on Iraq to comply with U.N.
resolutions, and said Baghdad's defiance was underscored by its
refusal to express regret for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   ``The long series of crises triggered by the Iraqi government
are pre-calculated attempts from time to time to disavow and
circumvent its legal obligations,'' Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah
told world leaders on Friday at the United Nations General Assembly
session.
	   ``The sad certainty, alas, is that all these crises contribute
to the perpetuation of the sanctions for which the government of
Iraq alone bears full responsibility,'' he said.
	   He said Iraq was trying to mislead the world with claims that it
had lived up to its obligations.
	   ``How could one reconcile that claim with the fact that we have
not yet heard from Iraq any declaration or seen any gesture
suggesting that Iraq regrets what it has done,'' Sheik Ahmed said.
	   He called on Baghdad to release all Kuwaitis captured during its
seven-month occupation of the emirate. Kuwait accuses Iraq of
holding some 500 of its citizens, a charge denied by Baghdad.
	   In response, an Iraqi representative denied Baghdad was holding
any hostages and instead accused Kuwait of detaining Iraqis.
	   The representative said Baghdad had complied with all U.N.
resolutions and that Richard Butler, the chief U.N. weapons
inspector, didn't have the courage to admit it because of
``pressures'' exerted by certain countries _ a reference to the
United States.
	   Sheik Ahmed also called on Israel to live up to obligations
agreed with the Arabs, including the return of all war-gained Arab
land.

New Zealand's recession undercuts prime minister's tax plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Just a week before a national election
in which Prime Minister John Howard is trying to sell voters on a
New Zealand-style goods and services tax, Australia's neighbor has
undercut his argument by falling into recession.
	   New Zealand's slide into recession -- after having been
publicized for years as a ``miracle'' of prosperity under
deregulation -- has forced Howard to defend the central plank of
his election campaign.
	   The campaign was largely shelved for the weekend as Australians
turned their attention to the final games in the two major football
leagues on Saturday and Sunday.
	   But opposition Labor Party leader Kim Beazley said Friday the
grim economic news from New Zealand proved Howard's proposed 10
percent goods and services tax in Australia would not help growth.
	   Buoyed by opinion polls showing a surge in Labor support and
growing concern about Howard's tax plan, Beazley moved to use New
Zealand's economic problems as a new avenue of attack against the
controversial tax.
	   But Labor's slim lead in the polls may not be enough for it to
capture government; it would have to win 27 seats from the
conservatives, a feat no Australian opposition party has ever
achieved.
	   New Zealand became the latest regional economy to fall into
recession since the onset of the Asian economic crisis, joining
Indonesia, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Thailand and Australia's major
trading partners South Korea and Japan.
	   Beazley said the good and services tax had helped stifle growth
in New Zealand, Canada and Japan.
	   ``There's a message in a bottle coming floating across the
Tasman (Sea) about whether or not a goods and services tax has got
any value to you at all,'' Beazley told reporters.
	   ``It does rather destroy the principal government selling point
-- what has happened in New Zealand -- as their economy goes into
recession.
	   ``The GST just rains on your economy, quietly away there,
without necessarily being noticed.''
	   But Howard hit back and used New Zealand's economic problems to
warn against Labor's plans to spend on job creation programs.
	   ``The GST was introduced in New Zealand more than 10 years ago,
so to suggest it is the thing that is causing current problems is
wrong,' Howard said.
	   ``The reason New Zealand's now going into trouble is that it's
overspent and that's the very thing that the Labor Party in the
Australian election campaign is now starting to do,'' he said.
	   He said the international economic climate would be tougher next
year, giving voters more reason to stay with his conservative
coalition in the Oct. 3 election.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer also defended the GST and said
the New Zealand recession was more due to the size of the country's
economy and its dependence on trade with Japan.
	   ``New Zealand is a small economy, they are doing battle with a
range of situations, it has nothing to do with their tax which now
took place many, many years ago,'' he told reporters.
	   ``What has more relevance is the downturn in Japan, one of their
biggest trading partners, and elsewhere.
	   ``We're better able to diversify a whole lot more than New
Zealand and I reject totally the suggestion that it is a tax
dimension that has created New Zealand's recession.''
	   In the House of Representatives, where government is formed,
Howard's governing Liberal Party and rural National coalition holds
90 seats, the Labor Party holds 49, independents 8 and the Northern
Territory's Country Liberal Party, 1.

SKorea willing to keep working despite provocation from North
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to UPDATE with reaction from North Korea &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ South Korea is willing to work towards a
final peace agreement with the North in spite of recent
provocations that include a submarine infiltration and rocket
launch, the south's foreign minister said.
	   Hong Soon-young spoke Friday to the General Assembly as
representatives of the four countries overseeing talks between the
Koreas met in New York to prepare for an upcoming round of
negotiations hosted by South Korea.
	   Friday's low-level meeting with U.S., Chinese and North and
South Korean officials was to set a date and make other
arrangements for the talks, said a State Department official,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Tensions between North and South Korea rose in June after a
submarine from the North was found entangled in a fishing net in
the waters off the South, its nine occupants dead inside. Tensions
heightened last month after the North fired a rocket over Japan
that U.S. and Japanese officials said at the time was a ballistic
missile.
	   Pyongyang said it was a satellite that failed to reach orbit.
	   ``My government deplores these acts of provocation. They pose a
serious threat to our security,'' Hong said in his speech.
	   ``But despite these acts of provocation, my government continues
to uphold the keynote of its engagement policy so that the two
Koreas might come to enjoy the benefits of peaceful coexistence.''
	   In response, the North Koreans lashed out at the south, saying
its response to the rocket launch ``only shows that they are
traitors to the nation and running dogs of the foreign forces,'' a
reference to the United States, which maintains a heavy presence on
the peninsula.
	   ``Our satellite launch is a grand national event to be recorded
in the history of our nation, which demonstrated the spirit and
talent of the Korean nation,'' said a representative of the Korean
mission.
	   He took a jab at the south's efforts to try to cope with the
region's financial crisis, accusing Seoul of selling off land,
factories and other real estate.
	   ``We are afraid they are selling the whole country and nothing
would be left for the South Koreans,'' the representative said in a
speech that drew laughter from South Korean representatives.
	   The United States, China and North and South Korea have been
working to replace a 1953 armistice that ended the Korean War. A
formal peace pact has never been signed.
	   Hong pledged to continue to work with an international
consortium developing light-water nuclear energy reactors in the
North. Pyongyang agreed in 1994 to refrain from developing nuclear
weapons in return for the reactors and fuel oil.
	   ``We also believe that both Koreas should renew their efforts to
implement the joint declaration of the denuclearization of the
Korean Peninsula of 1992,'' he said.

McGwire hits 66th homer, ties Sosa

	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ This time, Sammy Sosa's lead in the home run
derby lasted only 45 minutes.
	   Mark McGwire answered Sammy Sosa's 66th homer with his 66th
Friday night, a two-run shot in the fifth inning against Montreal
reliever Shayne Bennett.
	   When Sosa took the lead in the home run derby for only the
second time all season in the fourth inning, it prompted a
collective groan from a sellout crowd at Busch Stadium and booing
when Sosa's home run number was changed on the scoreboard.
	   With a runner on first, two outs and the fans on their feet,
McGwire hit a 1-2 pitch an estimated at 375 feet (113 meters) into
the left-field stands. It was his second homer this year against
Montreal and first since he connected off Trey Moore on April 21.
	   On the first pitch from Bennett, McGwire nearly homered on a
ball that landed just to the left of the foul pole in the upper
deck in left field. Busch Stadium personnel inadvertently set off
fireworks after the near-miss, but the fans didn't have to wait
long for the real thing.
	   Sosa led the home run race for about an hour on Aug. 19 before
McGwire regained the lead with his 48th and 49th homers later in
the same game at Chicago. Sosa tied McGwire at 65 with two home
runs Wednesday at Milwaukee, snapping his 0-for-21 slump.
	   McGwire had been 2-for-11 on the homestand with a pair of
singles before homering Friday night. He extended his National
League record to 161 walks on a full count in the first against
Miguel Batista and lined out to left in the third.
	   McGwire and Sosa each have two games left after Friday night,
with McGwire's at home against the Expos and Sosa's on the road
against the Astros.
	   The latest homer was No. 453 of McGwire's career, putting him in
20th place ahead of Carl Yastrzemski. He has hit 176 homers the
last three seasons.
	   In 204 career games with the Cardinals, McGwire has 90 homers,
182 RBIs and 204 walks. He has 47 homers and 95 RBIs in 104 career
games at Busch Stadium.

Mexican police arrest 17 in alleged child prostitution ring
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GUADALAJARA, Mexico (AP) _ Police in the western city of
Guadalajara arrested 17 adults Friday accused of running a child
prostitution ring.
	   The ring arranged for young girls _ apparently mostly teenagers
between the ages of 15 and 17 _ to have sex with customers in their
cars in Guadalajara, Mexico's second largest city, prosecutors
said.
	   ``We were more down on our luck than ever. Eva told me she would
help me out, by getting clients for me to have sex with,'' said a
16-year-old victim of the ring who identified herself only as
Blanca, referring to one of the suspects in the case.
	   ``She was to keep part of the money I made,'' Blanca said in an
interview at a youth detention center where she was taken following
the Friday morning raid on hotels where the ring operated.
	   Blanca said she charged about dlrs 20 for each sex act. Police
also confiscated a half-gallon of glue which the ring members
allegedly gave to the teenage prostitutes to sniff.
	   The girls were based at local hotels or street corners in
downtown Guadalajara, 280 miles (450 kilometers) northwest of
Mexico City. The suspects would contract for the prostitute's
services with customers at curbside and send the girls off in the
client's car.
	   The suspects _ four women and 13 men aged 18 to 51, are charged
with corrupting minors and procuring. They face possible prison
terms of one to five years on each count of corrupting, and three
to 10 years for each procurement count. Prison sentences in Mexico
are served concurrently.
	   Eleven underage prostitutes have been placed under the
supervision of family welfare authorities. Prostitution itself is
not strictly outlawed in Mexico, but profiting from it is a crime.
The age of consent in Mexico is 18.

Exhausted Mandela cancels appearances in Toronto
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to UPDATE with state dinner cut short, but
Mandela in good spirits &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Exhausted by a triumphant but hectic North
American tour, Nelson Mandela left a luncheon early and, at the
advice of his doctor, planned to cut short a state dinner.
	   At the luncheon Friday with business executives, the 80-year-old
South African president needed assistance returning to his seat
after speaking, then left the room early after repeatedly wiping
his brow.
	   Aides later announced Mandela would not appear as scheduled at
an afternoon news conference. Later Friday, he attended a dinner in
his honor hosted by Prime Minister Jean Chretien.
	   The South African leader appeared to be in good spirits, and
joked with reporters who questioned him about his health, saying he
was ready to challenge them to push-ups.
	   ``I do not know what I have done as an individual to merit
this,'' Mandela said of the reception he received from the crowd of
500 dignitaries.
	   The dinner program was shortened to accommodate Mandela, who
gave a five-minute speech before leaving for the airport for his
flight back to South Africa.
	   ``He has been examined by his physician,'' said Mandela's chief
of staff, Jakes Gerwel. ``There's nothing wrong with him, but he is
very exhausted.''
	   During the morning, Mandela looked full of life, at times
dancing during an appearance before a throng of schoolchildren at
the SkyDome, Canada's largest sports stadium.
	   After curtain-raisers that ranged from rap music to a circus
act, Mandela touched on serious themes in a speech to 40,000
people, mostly children.
	   He spoke at length about the hardships and challenges facing
children in South Africa, as well as the toll inflicted on children
worldwide by malnutrition, poverty and disease.
	   He recounted how he and other anti-apartheid activists yearned
for the sights and sounds of children during their years in prison
under white-minority rule.
	   ``When we were freed, we found there were no longer many
children in South Africa who could laugh,'' he said. ``The children
were forced to grow up very quickly.''
	   He thanked the young Canadians for attending the SkyDome
celebration, an event aimed at building support for the Nelson
Mandela Children's Fund. The fund seeks to raise money for
disadvantaged children in South Africa.
	   ``The greatest joy has been to discover that there are so many
children in this country who care about other children around the
world,'' Mandela said.
	   Most visiting foreign leaders stay away from Canada's most
volatile political issue _ the tension between mostly
French-speaking Quebec and the rest of Canada. But Mandela, who has
aspired to promote unity in South Africa, offered counsel.
	   ``It is a duty, especially of young people, to see to it that
whatever differences arise ... must be discussed in a spirit of
brotherhood,'' he said.
	   To loud cheers, he also urged Canada to place more women in
positions of power, saying they often were more principled and
consistent than male politicians.
	   ``Let the women of this country play their role,'' he said.
	   Among the dignitaries on the podium were Chretien, who called
Mandela ``the hero of the world,'' and Ontario's premier, Mike
Harris.
	   In a sharp break from the otherwise upbeat mood, schoolchildren
roundly booed Harris because of his government's confrontational
stance during a teachers' strike that has kept about 200,000 pupils
out of classes this month.

Americans down 2-0 to Italians; Sweden leads Spain 2-0
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ARNIE STAPLETON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) _ The United States sure could have used Jim
Courier, Pete Sampras, Michael Chang or Andre Agassi in their Davis
Cup semifinal against Italy.
	   Jan-Michael Gambill lost his Davis Cup debut Friday to Andrea
Gaudenzi and Todd Martin, the veteran American left on the roster,
was upset by Davide Sanguinetti in three sets as Italy took a
stunning 2-0 lead over the shellshocked Americans.
	   Sanguinetti, ranked 47th, beat the 28th-ranked Martin 7-6 (7-0),
6-3, 7-6 (10-8), putting the Italians, who won all four
tiebreakers, on the verge of a huge upset.
	   Martin, who struggled with his first serve and Sanguinetti's
consistent returns, and another Davis Cup rookie, Justin Gimelstob,
take on Gaudenzi and Diego Nargiso in Saturday's doubles match. A
loss would snap an 11-year home winning streak for the United
States.
	   In the other semifinal, Thomas Johansson had a perfect Davis Cup
debut on Friday night in Stockholm, beating Moya in three straight
but tough sets to give Sweden a commanding 2-0 lead in the
semifinals against Spain.
	   Johansson beat Moya 7-5, 7-6 (7-4), 7-6 (8-6), and Jonas
Bjorkman opened by downing Alex Corretja 6-3, 7-5, 6-7 (5-7), 6-3
in Stockholm.
	   ``I haven't played much better serve-and-volley tennis than
this,'' said Bjorkman, who broke the nail on his big toe during the
match. ``I'm extremely happy.''
	   Sweden can clinch the series Saturday when Bjorkman and Nicklas
Kulti play doubles against Javier Sanchez and Julian Alonso.
	   The Davis Cup final is Dec. 4-6.
	   The Americans have won 18 straight Davis Cup matches on home
courts, the last loss in 1987 when Boris Becker led West Germany to
a 3-2 victory in Hartford, Connecticut.
	   The only time the Americans have ever overcame a 2-0 deficit in
the Davis Cup was in 1934, when they rallied to defeat Australia in
Britain.
	   If they can avoid the sweep, the singles pairings are reversed
on Sunday.
	   Agassi, Sampras and Chang all decided against coming to
Milwaukee, and Courier was held out because he's not match-ready
with lingering muscle fatigue in his right biceps.
	   So the Americans had to turn to the next generation, and
experience won Round 1.
	   ``I was a little nervous and stupid,'' Gambill, 21, said after
losing to Gaudenzi in four sets at the Milwaukee Arena.
	   Italy's top player, Gaudenzi didn't allow the pressure or the
partisan crowd to get to him.
	   ``I've played five years in the Davis Cup. Obviously, he was
more nervous than I was,'' said Gaudenzi, who won 6-2, 0-6, 7-6
(7-0), 7-6 (7-4). ``The first match in Davis Cup is difficult for
anybody.''
	   Gambill, who has risen from 227th to 50th in the world rankings
after reaching the third round of the U.S. Open _ losing to French
Open champion Carlos Moya in a fifth-set tiebreaker _ said this
loss hurt more.
	   ``I was playing for a lot more than myself,'' Gambill said.
	   Gambill hoped to have an advantage playing indoors against
Gaudenzi, but the surface played slow and right into Gaudenzi's
strengths.
	   ``He was playing a clay-court specialist and everybody thought
he was going to win,'' Gaudenzi said with a smile.
	   Gambill, a rising star on tour who hits two-fisted from both
sides, survived eight match points before succumbing in the second
of the tiebreakers.
	   In qualifying series, U.S. Open champion Patrick Rafter and
Jason Stoltenberg helped Australia to a 2-0 lead over Uzbekistan at
Townsville, Australia.
	   At Nottingham, England, Greg Rusedski and Tim Henman rallied
from first-set losses to send Britain to a 2-0 lead over India.
	   At Osaka, Japan, Yevgeny Kafelnikov put Russia up 1-0 over Japan
with a victory over Japan's Goichi Motomura. Marat Safin was
leading Takao Suzuki 7-6 (7-4), 3-1 when rain halted play.
	   At Ramat Hasharon, Israel, France took a 2-0 lead over Israel on
victories by Cedric Pioline and Guillaume Raoux.
	   At Eindhoven, Netherlands, Paul Haarhuis and Jan Siemerink put
the Dutch up 2-0 on Ecuador.
	   At Prague, Czech Republic, Slava Dosedel upset Wayne Ferreira,
helping the Czechs to a 2-0 lead over South Africa.
	   At Buenos Aires, Argentina, Hernan Gumy upset Karol Kucera,
leaving the Argentines tied 1-1 with Slovakia.

Ruling Party, opposition closer to compromise on bank bills
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's ruling party and opposition leaders have
agreed on the fate of the ailing Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan,
bringing the two sides closer to a compromise on crucial banking
bills, a news report said Saturday.
	   The governing Liberal Democratic Party met Friday with the
opposition Democratic Party and the Heiwa Kaikaku Party to smooth
out differences on bills aimed at cleaning up bad debt in Japan's
banking system.
	   They agreed that the government would acquire all common shares
of LTCB, one of Japan's biggest lenders, effectively placing it
under state control, the Nihon Keizai financial daily said.
	   A proposed merger between LTCB and Sumitomo Trust and Banking
Co. could still go through if Sumitomo purchased the shares from
the government and made LTCB a subsidiary, the Nihon Keizai said.
	   However, the government and opposition still disagreed on when
the Finance Ministry would be stripped of powers to regulate the
financial sector. Opposition parties want the powers transferred to
an independent body by June 30, 1999.
	   The two sides were also at odds over a ruling party proposal to
create a new body to pump public funds into banks whose capital
adequacy ratios have fallen to dangerous levels, Kyodo News
reported.
	   Japan is under mounting pressure both at home and abroad to pass
legislation that would help clean up about dlrs 1 trillion worth of
bad loans at Japanese banks and restore health the financial
system.
	   But the opposition, which controls the upper house of
Parliament, has been blocking the government proposal and pressing
the ruling party to accept a rival version of the legislation.
	   Last week, the two sides reached a basic agreement on the bills
that appeared to absorb the key points of the opposition demands.
But the accord was worded vaguely and renewed bickering erupted
when the LDP and its adversaries came up with different
interpretations of the pact.

New Zealand's recession undercuts prime minister's tax plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ One week before a national election in
which Prime Minister John Howard is trying to sell voters on a
goods and services tax, the country that inspired the proposal has
undercut his argument by falling into recession.
	   New Zealand's slide into recession after years of being touted
as an economic ``miracle'' has forced Howard to defend the central
plank of his election campaign.
	   Opposition Labor Party leader Kim Beazley said Friday the grim
economic news from New Zealand proved Howard's proposed 10 percent
goods and services tax in Australia would not help growth.
	   Buoyed by opinion polls showing a surge in Labor support and
growing concern about Howard's tax plan, Beazley moved to use New
Zealand's economic problems as a new avenue of attack against the
controversial tax.
	   But Labor's slim lead in the polls may not be enough for it to
capture government; it would have to win 27 seats from the
conservatives, a feat no Australian opposition party has ever
achieved.
	   New Zealand became the latest regional economy to fall into
recession since the onset of the Asian economic crisis, joining
Indonesia, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Thailand and Australia's major
trading partners South Korea and Japan.
	   Beazley said the good and services tax had contributed to
stifling growth in New Zealand, Canada and Japan.
	   ``There's a message in a bottle coming floating across the
Tasman (Sea) about whether or not a goods and services tax has got
any value to you at all,'' Beazley told reporters.
	   But Howard hit back and used New Zealand's economic problems to
warn against Labor's plans to spend on job creation programs.
	   ``The GST was introduced in New Zealand more than 10 years ago,
so to suggest it is the thing that is causing current problems is
wrong,'' Howard said.
	   ``The reason New Zealand's now going into trouble is that it's
overspent and that's the very thing that the Labor Party in the
Australian election campaign is now starting to do,'' he said.
	   He said the international economic climate would be tougher next
year, giving voters more reason to stay with his conservative
coalition in the Oct. 3 election.

FIFA reduces time players must be released for Confederation Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ The 2002 World Cup might begin
earlier and feature a significant rules change designed to reduce
the number of shootouts.
	   FIFA, soccer's world governing body, said Friday the 2002 event,
with Japan and South Korea serving as hosts, would remain in the
customary period of June and July, but may open earlier in June.
	   ``Looking at meteorological studies from Japan and South Korea,
we feel it should be scheduled as long as possible in June,'' said
FIFA president Sepp Blatter.
	   While FIFA will decide on the actual dates at the executive
committee meeting in December, not everyone was convinced a move to
a May kickoff was out of the question.
	   ``In principle, it will be in June and July,'' said FIFA vice
president Mong-Joon Chung, president of the Korean Football
Association. ``But there will be further consultations between FIFA
and the two organizing committees to have further consideration of
the date.''
	   South Korea requested the event begin in May to avoid the rainy
season. The quadrennial, month-long competition traditionally has
started around June 10, well after the professional soccer seasons
in Europe and South America end.
	   The International Football Association Board will discuss the
committee's suggestion that two extra substitutes be permitted
during overtime in World Cup matches. That might open up play in
the extra sessions, which often are conservatively played and
marred by the exhaustion of the players.
	   That, in turn, could lead to more games decides in overtime,
avoiding shootouts. Only one game in France 98, when the hosts beat
Paraguay 1-0, ended in overtime.
	   FIFA said it would not change the dates of the upcoming
Confederation Cup, but would reduce the time clubs are required to
make their players available.
	   ``Clubs will no longer have to give up their players two weeks
before the Confederation Cup,'' Blatter said. ``Now we're requiring
clubs to make their players available 48 hours before the first
game of the competition.''
	   The United States, Mexico, Bolivia, Brazil, France, Saudi
Arabia, Egypt and the winner of the current Oceania contest in
Brisbane, Australia, will participate in the eight-nation
tournament. Scheduled for Mexico next Jan. 8-20 _ when leagues in
the southern hemisphere are in full swing and only some in Europe
are off _ several leagues will be left without their stars.
	   ``We're willing to be flexible,'' said Blatter. ``Now we ask
clubs to understand other continents are also involved and insisted
it not be scratched from the calendar.''
	   FIFA also discussed the dangers of the performance-enhancing
substance EPO and the possibility of introducing blood tests rather
than only urine tests, as well as random doping testing between
competitions. The IOC set a forum for Oct. 27 in Lausanne,
Switzerland, and invited all the international federations to
exchange views.
	   Candidates to stage the 2006 World Cup will be accepted at the
end of October, with bid countries required to confirm their bids
by April 1999. Bids will be reviewed by Jan. 31, 2000 and the
executive committee will select the host country in March 2000 _
not in June, as previously planned.

AIDS victims increase in Vietnam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Nearly 300 persons died of AIDS in Vietnam
over the past week, a indication that the deadly virus is rapidly
spreading in the country, officials said Saturday.
	   Dr. Quang Hai of the National AIDS Committee said the deaths of
275 patients during the week ending Sept. 21 was the highest
recorded in a seven-day period.
	   Hai said 10,226 people have contracted the virus, with 1,819 of
them suffering full-blown AIDS since the first case was detected in
December 1990. But the official said actual cases were probably six
to 10 times greater than the official statistics.
	   He said AIDS has spread to 59 of Vietnam's 61 provinces. Ho Chi
Minh City has been the most affected area, with 2,639 cases
reported.
	   Hai said the government has increased the budget to fight the
disease to dlrs 4.7 million this year from last year's dlrs 4
million. Most of the money is used for education about AIDS.

Exhausted Mandela cancels appearances in Toronto

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Exhausted by a triumphant but hectic North
American tour, Nelson Mandela left a luncheon early and, at the
advice of his doctor, planned to cut short a state dinner.
	   At the luncheon Friday with business executives, the 80-year-old
South African president needed assistance returning to his seat
after speaking, then left the room early after repeatedly wiping
his brow.
	   Aides later announced Mandela would not appear as scheduled at
an afternoon news conference. Later Friday, he attended a dinner in
his honor hosted by Prime Minister Jean Chretien.
	   The South African leader appeared to be in good spirits, and
joked with reporters who questioned him about his health, saying he
was ready to challenge them to push-ups.
	   ``I do not know what I have done as an individual to merit
this,'' Mandela said of the reception he received from the crowd of
500 dignitaries.
	   The dinner program was shortened to accommodate Mandela, who
gave a five-minute speech and then departed for South Africa.

 &UR; Yankees beat Devil Rays 6-1

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ With a typical dominating performance, the New
York Yankees shoved the '54 Indians out of the record book.
	   New York set an American League mark with its 112th win Friday
night, with Derek Jeter becoming the first Yankees shortstop in
nearly a half-century to get 200 hits in a 6-1 victory over the
Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
	   The Yankees (112-48) beat Tampa Bay for the ninth time in 10
games and increased their winning percentage to .700. They need
wins over the Devil Rays in their final two games to become the
first major league team since the '54 Cleveland Indians (111-43) to
play .700-ball over an entire season.
	   Only the 1906 Chicago Cubs, who went 116-36, had more wins than
these Yankees.
	   New York won its fifth straight game.
	   Orlando Hernandez (12-4) and Andy Pettitte both tuned up for the
playoffs, with Pettitte making his first relief appearance since
May 1, 1996. Hernandez allowed the one run and four hits in five
innings, and Pettitte allowed two hits in three shutout innings.
	   Jeter went 2-for-4, giving him 201 hits. He is the first Yankee
to reach 200 since Steve Sax (205) in 1989 and the first shortstop
since Phil Rizzuto (200) in 1950.
	   Bernie Williams went 2-for-2, increasing his average to .337 and
moving one point ahead of Boston's Mo Vaughn for the lead in the AL
batting race.
	   Former Yankee Dave Eiland (0-1) was pounded for all six runs and
six hits in 2 2-3 innings.
 &UR; Twins 5, Indians 4
	   In Minneapolis, Rookie Doug Mientkiewicz continued Cleveland's
final-week slide when he walked with the bases loaded in the ninth
inning to give the Minnesota Twins a victory over the staggering
Indians.
	   Mientkiewicz's second career RBI handed the Indians their fifth
straight loss and put them in danger of losing home-field advantage
in the first round of the playoffs and having to play the New York
Yankees.
	   If Texas wins its last three games _ including Friday's late
game at Seattle _ the Indians will play the Yankees instead of
Boston, the wild-card entry.
	   Paul Shuey (5-4) walked home the game-winning run. Rick Aguilera
(4-9) got the win despite blowing his 11th save of the season.
 &UR; Red Sox 8, Orioles 3
	   In Boston, Mo Vaughn, one of two Boston regulars playing the day
after the Red Sox clinched a wild-card berth, hit his 39th home run
and raised his batting average to .336 in a win over the Baltimore
Orioles.
	   Vaughn went 2-for-4 with an eighth-inning double.
	   Boston won for the fifth time in six games as Tim Wakefield
(17-8) set career highs for victories.
	   Chris Fussell (0-1) gave up four runs in 1 2-3 innings in his
second start and third major league appearance as the Orioles lost
their sixth straight.
	   Boston clinched its first playoff berth since 1995 with a 9-6
win Thursday night over Baltimore. On Friday, designated hitter
Mike Stanley and Vaughn, who said he wants to play the remaining
regular-season games, were Boston's only regulars in the lineup.
 &UR; Tigers 7, Blue Jays 5
	   In Toronto, Juan Encarnacion and Frank Catalanotto hit
consecutive homers and Tony Clark also connected in the third
inning as the Detroit Tigers beat the Toronto Blue Jays.
	   The Tigers won their season-high fourth straight game.
	   After Encarnacion and Catalanotto homered, Toronto starter Woody
Williams (10-9) walked Bobby Higginson before Clark hit his 34th
home run to give the Tigers a 4-1 lead.
	   Williams has given up 36 home runs this season, a new club
record. Jerry Garvin gave up 33 home runs in 1977.
	   Brian Moehler (14-13) allowed three earned runs and eight hits
in six innings. He struck out six and walked none.
 &UR; White Sox 3, Royals 0
	   In Kansas City, Mike Sirotka allowed four hits over 8 1-3
innings and the Chicago White Sox beat the Kansas City Royals.
	   Sirotka (14-15), whose had thrown two four-hitters in his
career, struck out six and walked two in his bid for his first
career shutout. He was relieved by Bobby Howry with one out in the
ninth after Carlos Beltran singled. Howry got two outs for his
eighth save.
	   Ricky Bones (2-2) took the loss.

Astros beat Cubs 6-2

<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ Neither Sammy Sosa nor the Chicago Cubs wound up
with the lead Friday night.
	   Sosa hit his 66th home run, leaving him tied with Mark McGwire,
but the Cubs failed to take advantage and lost to the Houston
Astros 6-2. The loss left Chicago tied for the NL wild-card lead
with the New York Mets.
	   The Mets lost to Atlanta 6-5. San Francisco, which began the day
one game behind Chicago and New York, played later at Colorado. All
three teams in the wild-card chase have two games left after
Friday.
	   Sosa temporarily gained the lead in his home run race with Mark
McGwire by hitting a 462-foot drive into the third level of the
Astrodome. About 45 minutes later, however, McGwire hit his 66th in
St. Louis' game against Montreal.
	   Derek Bell hit a two-run homer and Moises Alou singled home the
go-ahead run in the fourth inning for the NL Central champion
Astros. The Cubs lost for the fifth time in six games.
	   Facing friend and fellow Dominican Jose Lima, Sosa homered
leading off the fourth inning. Lima also gave up Nos. 50 and 51 to
Sosa at Wrigley Field on Aug. 23.
 &UR; Cardinals 6, Expos 5 &QC; 
	   In St. Louis, Mark McGwire hit No. 66, a two-run shot in the
fifth inning off Shayne Bennett.
	   Rookie J.D. Drew had a pair of two-run homers for the Cardinals,
who have won 10 of 12 to guarantee a winning record.
	   When Sosa took the lead in the home run derby for only the
second time all season at Houston, it prompted a collective groan
from a sellout crowd at Busch Stadium and booing when Sosa's home
run number was changed on the scoreboard.
	   But McGwire brought back the cheers when he hit a 1-2 pitch
about 375 feet into the left-field stands. It was the 21st time
that McGwire and Sosa homered on the same day.
 &UR; Braves 6, Mets 5 &QC; 
	   In Atlanta, New York twice left the bases loaded and stranded 12
runners overall in the loss to Atlanta, which left the Mets tied
with Chicago for the wild-card lead.
	   Andruw Jones and Keith Lockhart homered for Atlanta, which tied
a franchise record with its 104th win and secured the home-field
advantage throughout the league playoffs.

 &UR; Eds: Updates with industry predicting chaos in state if gas not
restored by Monday. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Victoria state is fast running out
of natural gas Saturday following a massive fire that killed two
workers at the Esso gas plant and injured eight.
	   The plant at Sale about 110 miles (180 km) east of Melbourne
supplies 80 percent of Victoria's gas.
	   It was still shut down as firefighters continued to fight a
massive blaze that broke out at 12:30 p.m. Friday.
	   Police and Esso confirmed Saturday that two workers died in the
explosion and eight others were injured.
	   One man is in a serious condition at Melbourne's Alfred Hospital
where he has undergone over six hours of surgery.
	   A hospital spokeswoman said the man suffered severe bone
injuries which surgeons had been able to fix, and extensive burns.
	   Firefighters were working in cooperation with Esso employees
Saturday to cool down equipment so gas supply valves could be shut
down.
	   Esso said it was too early to forecast when any moves would be
made to again begin gas production, on which hundreds of thousands
of consumers and major state industries rely.
	   The Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VECCI)
predicted economic chaos unless supply resumed before Monday.
	   Car manufacturers, bakeries, biscuit makers, glass makers,
brewers, bottlers, brick kilns, laundries and Victoria's
hospitality industry all run on gas, VECCI CEO David Edwards said
Saturday.
	   ``In June, a 25 percent restriction of supply from the Esso
Longford plant forced car makers alone to stand down thousands of
workers.
	   ``This weekend there is a total shutdown. Nobody is supposed to
be using gas and the damage is approaching the incalculable.
	   ``June's restriction caused an estimated 75 million Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 43.5 million) damage to the state's economy but
this was much less of a restriction that the one we now face,'' he
said.
	   Car makers have already stood down workers. Friday night's late
shift at Toyota's plants were sent home and unless normal supplies
resumed on Monday there would be no work, a company spokesman said.
	   Without gas, there would be no work for the company's 2,600
employees and this would be the same case for Ford and Holden.
	   Victoria's gas supply authority VENCorp has invoked emergency
laws, ordering all industry and home owners to stop using gas to
maintain supplies -- although pilot lights should be kept alight.
	   As Victoria state runs out of gas, no non-essential gas
consumers are exempt, including restaurants, hotels and bakeries.
The ban also covers heaters, hot water systems and stoves.
	   Under emergency powers invoked by the state government, people
who use gas appliances are subject to a 500 Australian dollars
(U.S. dlrs 290) penalty for the first offense and 100 Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 58) for each repeated offense, he said.
	   ``Penalties apply if people ignore these instructions, as there
in only enough gas for hospitals, and aged and infirm residential
homes,'' VENCorp spokesman David Guthrie-Jones said.
