<HEADLINE> 6 Civilians, 2 Militiamen Wounded in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Six Lebanese civilians and two
militiamen of the Israeli allied South Lebanon Army (SLA) were
wounded Saturday in separate incidents in south Lebanon, the
National Broadcasting Network radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The six civilians were injured when a house in the Majdal Silm
village in the central sector of the Israeli occupied border zone
in south Lebanon was hit by Israeli shells.
</P>
<P>
They were staying inside the house at the time, the radio
said, adding that one of them, who was in serious condition, had
been rushed to a hospital in the country's southern port city of
Sidon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli attack raised to 13 the number of Lebanese
civilians wounded in south Lebanon since the start of this
year. One civilian was killed during an Israeli air raid on the
country's eastern province of Bekaa last month.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, two SLA militiamen were wounded in a
roadside bomb in the village of Houla, five kilometers north of
Majdal Silm.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has claimed
responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, conflicts between Israeli forces and Lebanese
guerrillas have never stopped.

<HEADLINE> Monica Lewinsky Tells Her Story on Videotape at Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Broadcast across the world
Saturday from the well of the U.S. Senate, former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky recounted via videotape her story of a
presidential affair and cover-up to Americans seeing her testify
for the first time and to senators who must decide the fate of
President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
House prosecutors juxtaposed the image of Lewinsky, dressed in
a dark dress, her hand raised to tell the truth, with the
now-famous footage of the January 1998 news conference in which
Clinton denied sexual relations with "that woman, Ms. Lewinsky."
</P>
<P>
House prosecutor James Rogan implored senators to listen to "a
bright lady whose life has forever been marked by the most
powerful man on earth."
</P>
<P>
"If her testimony is truthful, then the president committed the
offenses in the articles of impeachment," Rogan added, calling
today's extraordinary session at the impeachment trial the "first
and only chance'' to hear from witnesses with "direct knowledge of
the unlawful conduct of the president of the United States."
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, is
charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in two articles of
impeachment in connection with his relationship with Lewinsky. The
two articles were approved by the House along partisan lines on
December 19 last year.
</P>
<P>
The Senate is expected to vote on the two articles of
impeachment against Clinton on February 12. A two-thirds vote is
needed to convict the president and remove him from office. No one
believes there are enough votes in the Senate to remove Clinton.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. borrowing by
consumers increased at a faster pace in December, the New York
Times reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Led by demand for auto and credit card loans, borrowing rose
7.3 billion dollars to 1.308 trillion dollars in the last month
of 1998, the paper quoted the U.S. Federal Reserve data of Friday.
</P>
<P>
Revolving loans, which include credit cards, increased 2.2
billion dollars after falling 700 million dollars in
November.Auto loans rose 5.9 billion in December while other
types of installment loans fell 800 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The pace of consumer credit rose at a 6.7 percent annual rate
in December, as compared with the 3.7 percent pace in November.
</P>
<P>
Consumers are benefiting from low inflation, low oil prices,
low interest rates, hefty rises in the stock market and the
lowest unemployment rate, the data said.
</P>
<P>
Economists watch the Fed's credit report to help them gauge
consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of economic

WASHINGTON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Broadcast across the world
Saturday from the well of the U.S. Senate, former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky recounted via videotape her story of a
presidential affair and cover-up to Americans seeing her testify
for the first time and to senators who must decide the fate of
President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
House prosecutors juxtaposed the image of Lewinsky, dressed in
a dark dress, her hand raised to tell the truth, with the
now-famous footage of the January 1998 news conference in which
Clinton denied sexual relations with "that woman, Ms. Lewinsky."

"If her testimony is truthful, then the president committed the

today's extraordinary session at the impeachment trial the "first

the unlawful conduct of the president of the United States."
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, is
charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in two articles of
impeachment in connection with his relationship with Lewinsky. The
two articles were approved by the House along partisan lines on
December 19 last year.
</P>
<P>
The Senate is expected to vote on the two articles of
impeachment against Clinton on February 12. A two-thirds vote is
needed to convict the president and remove him from office. No one
believes there are enough votes in the Senate to remove Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors, denied the chance to call witnesses for live
testimony at the trial, played excerpts from the videotaped
depositions they took earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky was seen staring intently at her inquisitor,
prosecutor Ed Bryant, as she fielded questions and gave short
crisp answers. Her image, from the waist up, played against a dull
gray background.
</P>
<P>
She told prosecutors that at the time of the December 17, 1997,
call, she was well familiar "because it was part of the pattern of
the relationship." Prosecutors contend Clinton was trying to
encourage her to lie, but she has testified he never instructed
her to do so.
</P>
<P>
The tape showed a young woman at ease with answering
now-familiar questions, a marked change from the distraught former
intern said to have frequently cried when first thrust into the
impeachment crisis a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Though Americans have said repeatedly in surveys that they want
the impeachment proceedings to end, many were expected to tune in
Saturday to get their first glimpse of Lewinsky speaking. The
trial was carried live by CNN, C-SPAN and CBS among others.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors also showed snippets from the testimony of two
other witnesses, presidential friend Vernon Jordan and White House
aide Sidney Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
The session is the last before closing arguments, scheduled for
next Monday, but the schedule could be affected at the last minute
if King Hussein of Jordan dies. A number of senators would be
expected to attend services for the respected monarch.
</P>
<P>
With Clinton's acquittal on impeachment charges virtually
assured, Senate Republicans and Democrats are quietly jockeying
over how strongly -- if at all -- he should be censured for his
relationship with Lewinsky and his efforts to conceal it.

<HEADLINE> Highway Traffic Halted by Floods in Mozambican </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The highway traffic in
Mozambique's central Zambezia Province had been partly halted by
floods resulting from the consecutive heavy rains in the past few
days.
</P>
<P>
The movement of personnel and goods had been seriously
affected, the state-run Radio Mozambique said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The only road linking Lugela County and other part of the
province was cut off Tuesday after a bridge across the Lugela
River was destroyed by the heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
The highway linking the counties of Mocuba and Alto Molocue was
also stopped due to the rains, delaying the people and goods which
come from Mozambique's Maputo, Beira cities and neighboring
countries of Zimbabwe and Malawi, and head for Nampula Province
and northern port city of Nacala.
</P>
<P>
According to information from the provincial capital of
Quelimane, the Chire River has flooded various plants in a large
area and forcing some 7,000 people fleeing Morrumbala to
neighboring Malawi.
</P>
<P>
For past week, heavy rains lasted in many parts of the southern
African country, raising the water levels of many rivers. It was
estimated that some 18,000 hectares of farmland had been flooded.

<HEADLINE> A New EarthquaKe Fault Found In California </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- A new earthquake fault has
been found by geologist Scott Kieffer, the Associated Press said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Kieffer discovered this fault last fall while he was mapping
the Mussel Rock area of Daly City when he roped down the side of
a cliff to examine layers of sedimentary rock.
</P>
<P>
He said that he found clear evidence of a quake across a
previously unmapped fault.
</P>
<P>
He dated the sedimentary layer around the fault to 120,000
years ago, which means it would be classified as inactive, but it
would be taken as active if it has generated a quake as recently
as 11,000 years ago, and would require urgent study to survey its
seismic danger.
</P>
<P>
Commenting this discovery, Nicholas Sitar from University of
California, Berkeley, said this is a major fault trace, no question
about it.

HARARE, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean Industry and
Commerce Ministry said here Saturday that Italy will provide aid
to Zimbabwean small- and medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The actual disbursements of funds under the first tranche of
the six- million-U.S. Dollar Italian commodity aid program meant
for small-to-medium scale enterprises (SMEs) will be done during
the last quarter of this year, said the ministry in a statement.
</P>
<P>
However, the Zimbabwe News Agency quoted the statement as
saying that successful applications will have to be forwarded to
Italy for further tendering,
</P>
<P>
"The small-to-medium scale companies are therefore being
invited to submit their applications and ensuring that the
conditions to the aid program are fulfilled," the ministry said,
adding that it will entertain all queries pertaining to the
program.
</P>
<P>
Under the scheme, non-essential and luxury goods like perfumes,
 cosmetics, artistic objects, watches and clocks, alcoholic
beverages, sport articles, domestic furniture and handicraft goods
are not allowed.
</P>
<P>
Applications for a minimum of one million Zimbabwean Dollars
(25,640 U.S. Dollars) should be received from the SMEs while
actual allocations will be in Italian lira or U.S. Dollars.

BEIRUT, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Seven Lebanese civilians and two
militiamen of the Israeli allied South Lebanon Army (SLA), were
wounded Saturday in separate incidents in south Lebanon, the
National Broadcasting Network radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Six civilians from the same family and another 60-year-old
woman were injured when their house in the Majdal Silm village in
the central sector of the Israeli occupied border zone in south
Lebanon was hit by shells.
</P>
<P>
They were rushed to hospitals in the nearby Tibnin village and
the country's southern port city of Sidon and Tyre.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli attack raised to 14 the number of Lebanese
civilians wounded in south Lebanon since the start of this
year. One civilian was killed in an Israeli air raid on the
country's eastern province of Bekaa last month.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, two SLA militiamen were wounded in a
roadside bombing attack in the village of Houla, five kilometers
north of Majdal Silm.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has claimed
responsibility for the attack.

Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon

<HEADLINE> French Senators Call For Lifting Sanctions on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 6 (Xinhua) -- A visiting French senators
delegation on Saturday called for bringing an end to the
U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq for more than eight years, the
Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Head of the French delegation, Chairman of the Christian Fifth
French Republic Movement Michael Griman made the appeal when
meeting with Chairman of the Iraqi National Assembly (parliament)
Saadoun Hammadi.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Griman referred to the violations committed by
the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) on disarming Iraq when
practicing its mandate inside Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long accused the UNSCOM of carrying out espionage
activities in Iraq and being used as a tool by the U.S. to prolong
the U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Hammadi reviewed means of fostering the links between the two
countries' parliaments, and he also briefed the French delegation
on the latest U.S.-British attacks on Iraq and the relationship
between Iraq and the U.N., the INA reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain launched air raids on Iraq in
mid-December to retaliate what they claimed Iraq's non-cooperation
with U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Since then, clashes between Iraqi air defense forces and
U.S. and British warplanes patrolling the no-fly zones have
become commonplace.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed sanctions on Iraq following its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait, which touched off the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones after the
1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting the Kurds in the
north and the Shiite Muslim in the south from "Baghdad's
suppression."

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Rules out Military Involvement in Guinea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalam Abubakar has ruled out the military involvement in
Guinea Bissau, saying that "we cannot send soldiers to Guinea
Bissau."
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian leader who arrived in Senegal Friday for a two-day
visit to the country said in an interview with Panafrican News
Agency that Nigeria will make facilities and logistics available
in order to help restore peace to Guinea Bissau.
</P>
<P>
He noted that he had been talking with Guinea Bissau's
President Joao Bernado Vieira and rebel leader Ansumane Mane,
adding "I am still talking to them and we are still doing what we
can to put an end to the conflict."
</P>
<P>
Abubakar said that he and Senegalese President Abdou Diouf are
discussing the situation in Guinea Bissau and Sierra Leone as
"Senegal is a key player on this issue and certainly has a role to
play in Guinea Bissau."
</P>
<P>
Senegal and Guinea sent troops to Guinea Bissau to support the
government of President Vieira last June when the dismissed army
chief, Amsumane Mane took up arms against the government.
</P>
<P>
During the interview, the Nigerian leader also criticized the
Commonwealth for failing to help Sierra Leone end the civil war in
the tiny west African country.
</P>
<P>
He said that the conflicts in Sierra leone would have been
brought to an end if the British-led body had supported peace
efforts in a concrete way.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Allied Militiaman Killed by Roadside Bomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 6 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli allied South Lebanon
Army (SLA) militiaman died Saturday in hospital after being
seriously wounded by a roadside bomb in south Lebanon, security
sources said.
</P>
<P>
He and his colleague were hurt when their car was blown up by a
bomb planted on the main road in the Houla village in the central
sector of the Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has claimed
responsibility for the attack, which led to the first death of
SLA militiaman since the start of this year, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
In response, the SLA forces fired shells on four villages on
the fringe of the central sector of the zone, wounding seven
Lebanese civilians in the village of Majdal Silm.
</P>
<P>
The SLA shelling raised to 14 the number of Lebanese civilians
wounded in south Lebanon since the beginning of this year. One
civilian was killed during an Israeli air raid on the country's
eastern province of Bekaa last month.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, conflicts between Israeli forces and Lebanese
guerrillas have never stopped.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder Affirms German Commitments at Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 6 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder told delegates to the annual Munich Security Policy
Conference Saturday that his coalition government "will make its
contribution" to fulfilling alliance obligations.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder affirmed Germany had shaken off the legacy of two
world wars and would shoulder full NATO responsibility as German
troops stood poised to deploy Leopard II tanks as peacekeepers if
a Kosovo peace deal is reached.
</P>
<P>
"For a long time even after German unification there was talk
in public... as if historical burdens of a country responsible for
two world wars this century barred deployment of German troops
abroad," Schroeder told delegates to the Security Policy
conference.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said a key way to strengthen NATO was to bolster the
Alliance's European pillar through creating political and military
decision structures for the 15-nation European Union (E.U.).
</P>
<P>
"A common security and defense identity is an indispensable
building block for the European house," he said, adding: "The new
NATO will have a strengthened European pillar and, through this,
will be strengthened overall."
</P>
<P>
As a means to achieve this, Schroeder called for the post of
Western European Union (WEU) secretary general to be absorbed by
the E.U.'s future "Mr. Europe" who will be in charge of
coordinating foreign and security policy.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1954 the WEU has long remained a mere fledging
European defense body without a clear role. In 1991 the EU
formally said it should become a defense component for Brussels,
even though not all E.U. members are WEU members.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said given he wanted a bigger European role for NATO
it was to be welcomed that the U.S. planned to send a limited
number of troops to Kosovo should a peace deal be reached.
</P>
<P>
"We Europeans will not try to go it alone but, if we had been
insufficiently prepared for an active role in setting up a new
peace order, would we have had the right to complain if others had
possibly taken unilateral decisions?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week German Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping said
Bonn planned to send up to 30 Leopard II main battle tanks to
serve with peacekeepers in Kosovo. This would mark the first time
in the post-war era Germany has sent such frontline ground troops
and equipment on an international peacemaking mission.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said Germany would continue to assist Russia in its
ongoing reform process. Germany and Europe had an "enormous
responsibility" for economic and political developments in Russia.
</P>
<P>
He charged that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had at
times not taken the country's history and social makeup fully into
consideration when dealing with Russia. He said the international
community must work out conditions which would allow the IMF to
release the second tranche of economic aid to Russia.
</P>
<P>
The German chancellor suggested that German and European aid be
tied to concrete projects. "Just handing over money is not always
the right thing to do," he said.
</P>
<P>
On NATO expansion, Schroeder said "the door must remain open"
to further candidates from central and eastern Europe. But he said
he did not expect any action on potential new candidates at the
upcoming NATO summit in Washington in April.
</P>
<P>
He said that a period of consolidation should follow Poland,
Hungary and the Czech Republic's joining the alliance.

<HEADLINE> Belgium Seizes Eritrea-Bound Military Equipment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Belgium has seized 40 truck
loads and 51 container loads of military equipment bound for
Eritrea, a local newspaper reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Antwerp Gazette said that the Eritrea-bound military
equipment was seized by the Antwerp customs officials in northern
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Customs officials investigated into the cargo which arrived
last year from neighboring the Netherlands and was transported
under the name of a British company, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Though the cargo was declared to be construction equipment such
as pumps, the Antwerp customs officials still called in military
experts who later found out that the 40 trucks contained canons
while the 51 containers carried motors specially manufactured for
Soviet-made T-54 and T-55 tanks.
</P>
<P>
The cargo was held by the Antwerp customs in that any export of
military equipment has to have the approval of the foreign
ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Belgium foreign ministry already confirmed the confiscation
of the Eritrea-bound military equipment, according to the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea and Ethiopia, both Horn of Africa nations, are fighting
a war over disputed borders. A brief ground and air war last year
killed some 1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Eritrean and Ethiopian soldiers were reportedly engaged in a
renewed fighting this week along the borders and both sides are
accusing the other party of starting the latest round of clash
despite ongoing diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Warns Air Strikes Remain an Option in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Western air strikes remain an
option in the Kosovo conflict if the peace talks between Serbs and
ethnic Albanians fail to reach agreement, U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen warned in Munich Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Air strikes remain an option," Cohen told the Security Policy
conference in Munich.
</P>
<P>
Cohen also said that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
must adapt to be able to better deal with regional conflicts. NATO
troops' mobility and tenacity must be improved, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Defense Secretary urged European countries to play a
more active role within the Atlantic alliance. He hinted that
European countries might increase their defense spending, noting
that the United States was increasing defense spending by 112
billion dollars over the next six years.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer called for a peace
conference for the southern Balkans. Fischer said such a
conference was essential once the guns were silent to secure a
permanent political solution.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said a path must be found that would lead Bosnia,
Croatia, Macedonia, Albania and also Serbia "from that Europe of
the past to the Europe of the future", a place of integration and
peace.

<HEADLINE> Peace Talks on Kosovo Start in France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RAMBOUILLET, France, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The peace talks on
the conflict of Kosovo were opened by French President Jacques
Chirac in the late afternoon on Saturday in a 14th century castle
of this quiet French town some 50 kilometers southwest of Paris.
</P>
<P>
Chirac addressed the two delegations representing the
conflicting sides of Kosovo sitting in two separate groups of a
hall of the castle, appealing them to make a choice between the
tragedies of the past and the hope of the future,
</P>
<P>
"This is the fate of Kosovo, but above all the fate of women,
men and children who live on this land, that you will determine
the destiny of," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
The conference was decided by the six-nation Contact Group on
former Yugoslavia last month in London, in order to end an
11-month violence in the Yugoslav province, in which 2,000 were
killed and tens of thousands made homeless.
</P>
<P>
The peace plan drawn up by the six-nation Contact Group also
aims to obtain a large autonomy for Kosovo, while guaranteeing the
territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the conference was delayed for about four hours
because the two French C-130 military planes carrying the
delegation of ethnic Albanians did not take off until early
afternoon from Pristina, after obtaining permission from the Serb
authorities to allow all the members of the delegation to leave.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Chirac used the reconciliation between
France and Germany, two rivals during two world wars, as an
example of how people can let pass the past and build a future.
</P>
<P>
He said that the will of peace can be more powerful than the
temptation of war, as former French President Charles de Gaulle
and former German Chancellor Adenauer did several decades ago in
the same castle, when they vowed to rebuild the French-German
relations.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine called on the
participants of the talks to think first all about the people of
Kosovo, their fears and their rights.
</P>
<P>
"Reject the fatality of violence and war, dare to think about
your coexistence and invent peace. You should have courage, much
courage. Be stronger than tragedy," he said.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which are expected to end within two weeks, are
co-chaired by Vedrine and Cook, and are attended by a 13-member
Yugoslav delegation headed by the Vice Prime Minister of Serbia
Ratko Markovic, a 16-member ethnic Albanian delegation, and U.S.
ambassador Christopher Hill, Russian diplomat Boris Mayorski, and
Austrian diplomat Wolfgang Petritsch who represents the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
If nothing is achieved within two weeks, NATO is likely to
stage air strikes against Serb forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
French officials said that the holding of the conference would
make up a real jump for a European common diplomacy aimed at
solving crisis in the Balkans, as France and Britain are the two
initiators for bringing the irreconcilable parties of Kosovo
together at the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
However, everyone expects to see tough negotiations in the
coming days as the stands of the two sides are more than far from
each other in their regard of the peace plan of the Contact Group.
</P>
<P>
The peace plan includes an interim agreement containing a
mechanism for a final settlement after a three-year transitional
period, guaranteeing territorial integrity for Yugoslavia,
cultural identity for all ethnic groups, and free elections in
nine month.
</P>
<P>
It also called for the amnesty and release of all political
prisoners, a high degree autonomy for Kosovo, a fair
representation of all ethnic groups in government, an ethnically
representative police force, protection of human rights, a dispute
solution mechanism and international participation if necessary.
</P>
<P>
The talks were preceded by a last wrestling of arms between the
Serbs and Albanians, as the Serb authorities first blocked some
members of the Albanian delegation from leaving Pristina.
</P>
<P>
Voljislav Zevkovic, a senior member of the Yugoslav delegation,
said on Saturday that although some members of the Kosovo
Liberation Army (KLA), who are part of the Albanian delegation,
were finally allow to go to France, his delegation will not attend
the talks if the KLA members show up at the conference.
</P>
<P>
The head of the Yugoslav delegation Markovic said that the
Yugoslav delegates would never negotiate with "terrorists," a term
used by Belgrade to refer to the KLA.
</P>
<P>
But the six members of the Contact Group -- the United States,
France, Britain, Russia, Germany and Italy -- all hope that all
Albanian factions will take part in the talks.
</P>
<P>
For its part, the ethnic Albanian delegation has criticized the
selection of the members of the Yugoslav delegation, saying that
it is a mixture of top Serb officials and unimportant ethnic
leaders, such as those of the Turkish, Egyptian, and Tzigane
communities in Kosovo, who cannot make any decision.
</P>
<P>
About a hundred Albanians from France, Germany and other
Western European countries demonstrated Saturday in Rambouillet,
waving Albanian flag of double-head black eagle and shouting
"Kosovo, Kosovo!"
</P>
<P>
The KLA issued a statement on Friday saying that they would
stick to the stand of winning independence for Kosovo during the
talks.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Forms Air Quality Management Advisory Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
formed a 12-member "air quality management advisory committee" to
coordinate actions to control air pollution in the capital Dhaka
and other major cities in the country, the official BSS news
agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of the committee is to formulate appropriate
policies to improve the urban air standards under the World
Bank-aided air quality management project.
</P>
<P>
The committee, which comprises representatives of various
ministries and agencies, will also give necessary directives to
concerned departments for implementation of the policy.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the World Bank announced its approval for a
177-million U.S. dollar credit to help solve Dhaka's traffic and
air pollution woes under the joint collaboration of the government
and the Dhaka City Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Public exposure to air pollution in Dhaka is estimated to cause
15,000 premature deaths and several million cases of sickness
every year, according to the World Bank's statement issued on the
day of announcing the approval for the project.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank's approval coincided with a government decision
to stop the use of leaded petroleum, identified as the main
culprit for Dhaka's increasingly polluted air.
</P>
<P>
Air pollution and traffic problems in Dhaka, with a population
of over nine million living on an area of 815 square kilometers
and 630,000 vehicles and about one million rickshaws plying in the
streets, has reached "crisis proportions," and the situation in
other major cities is becoming worse as they are expanding
rapidly, according to press reports.

<HEADLINE> Low Death Rate For Shanghai's Cancer Recovery Club </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Cancer strikes 1.4 million
more people each year in China and 1.05 million die, but the death
rate at the Shanghai Cancer Club was only 5.31 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Cancer is still one of the most deadly diseases in the world
and it is the biggest threat to people between the ages of 20 and
64 in China, which has 320,000 people with cancers and 270,000 who
die from it every year.
</P>
<P>
But only 278 of the 5,231 Club members died. One of its
founders, 49-year-old Yuan Zhengping, developed a malignant tumor
of the lymph nodes in 1980, and his physician concluded that he
would live for only three months. He is still living after 20
years, but that's not uncommon among Club members.
</P>
<P>
It was established in 1989 and now has more than 5,000 members.
The survival rate among them has risen from 33.6 percent 5 years
ago to 48 percent. The Club tries to prolong the life of patients
by raising their spirits to fight the disease and by using various
recovery activities.
</P>
<P>
It has recovery aid centers and schools where members do
physical exercises and solve psychological problems to help
conquer fears. One of its greatest successes has been in
encouraging patients to take charge of various jobs where they not
only perform their duties, but also visit families of other
patients and provide financial aid and organize trips for them.
</P>
<P>
Hospitals in Shanghai have also established recovery centers
and some well-known organizations have donated money to the club,
which has in turn contributed to society in other ways. They
donated over 30,000 yuan (about 3,600 U.S. dollars) to China's
flood victims last year.
</P>
<P>
Delegations from Japan and Germany and other countries have
visited the Club and members have been to the United States, Japan,
and Hong Kong.

party appear unwilling to support a charge that Clinton lied about
his relationship with former White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
-- The Jordanian cabinet declared on Saturday the stricken King
Hussein incapacitated and transferred authority to his son
Abdullah, as the United States and governments in the Middle East
pledged political and financial support for the neophyte ruler.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Monica S. Lewinsky spoke to the Senate and the world on
Saturday, via videotape, about her extramarital affair with
President Clinton, which plunged him and the nation into an
impeachment ordeal.
</P>
<P>
-- The Kosovo peace conference opened Saturday to exhortations
from President Jacques Chirac of France that both sides put aside
their differences. Chirac told the delegates that the conference
was about peace, but not about forgetting justice.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Continues at Ethio-Eritrean Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian government
spokesperson Selome Taddesse said Sunday that fighting at the
Badme-Sheraro front of the Ethiopia-Eritrean border is continuing.
</P>
<P>
This is the second day fighting between Ethiopian and Eritrean
forces since the nine-month border dispute renewed into armed
clashes Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian government spokesperson said in a telephone
interview Sunday afternoon that her office has not received
information from the warring front so far.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, information from the Eritrean side has also
confirmed the fighting at Badme-Sheraro front.
</P>
<P>
Badme, the center of fighting since Saturday, is a rocky
triangle of land at the western end of the border and was occupied
by Eritrea during a brief land and air war between the two
countries last May and June.
</P>
<P>
So far, neither Ethiopia nor Eritrea has made any announcement
about Sunday's fighting at the Badme-Sheraro front.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia said Saturday that its forces captured Geza Gerlase, a
major Eritrean stronghold, during the first day fighting between
the two Horn of Africa neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has called on both sides to stop their
fighting.

<HEADLINE> Cyclist Hopes to Enter Guinness Book of Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Georgian engineer Dzhumber
Lezhava hopes to enter into the Guinness Book of Records as the
man who covered the world's longest cycling journey.
</P>
<P>
The 60-year-old Lezhava, now in Paris, has already finished 171,
000 kilometers in 111 countries by bicycle since August 1993, the
Interfax news agency reported Sunday in a dispatch from Tbilisi,
capital of the former Soviet republic.
</P>
<P>
He told his countrymen on Georgian radio that the goal of his
endeavor is to popularize Georgia.
</P>
<P>
His journey is proceeding normally and will end in Tbilisi on
January 1, 2001, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Lezhava said a carnival in Rio de Janeiro and a visit to the
Antarctic had made the strongest impressions on him. He complained
that he had not been allowed to cross the Antarctic on bicycle and
that he had covered just several dozen kilometers of the ice-
sealed continent.
</P>
<P>
For safety reasons, Lezhava was barred from traveling across
Algeria where terrorists are raging. "Still, I will cycle across
Algeria and, I'm sure, the terrorists will not do me any harm," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he had learned to speak English and Spanish pretty
well and that in countries where other languages are spoken he
learns several dozen words which help him deal with the local
population.
</P>
<P>
Lezhava was named an UNESCO peace envoy a few days ago in Paris.
UNESCO Director-General Federico Major praised Lezhava's journey
as a call for cultural dialogue and mutual trust, Interfax said.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's new King Abdullah Bin
Hussein was sworn in before the parliament and cabinet on Sunday,
three and a half hours after the death of his father, King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Placing his right hand on the Koran, the new monarch pledged
loyalty to the constitution and his faithfulness to the nation.
</P>
<P>
The swearing-in ceremony was held in a special session of the
parliament presided over by Senate President Zaid Rifaee, and
attended by Royal family members, Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh
and government ministers.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the brief ceremony, the new king retired to a next
room to receive salutations and condolences from parliament
members, cabinet ministers and other senior state officials, whom
he kissed and hugged.
</P>
<P>
The accession to Jordan's throne of the 37-year-old eldest son
of King Hussein marked a smooth transition of power in the
strategically situation kingdom.
</P>
<P>
In a sign of solidarity, the new king's uncle, Prince Hassan
Ibn Talal attended the ceremony, and walked shoulder by shoulder
with Abdullah before they entered the parliament building.
</P>
<P>
Hassan had been the crown prince for 34 years before he was
deposed by King Hussein on January 26 in a sudden shakeup of
power, which changed the line of succession in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Hussein died Sunday morning after losing a seven-month battle
against lymphatic cancer.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Deputies Discuss Problem Of City's Displaced Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The deputies to the 11th
Shanghai Municipal People's Congress, the local legislature, say
that there needs to be a greater effort from the government and
community level to find jobs for displaced workers.
</P>
<P>
The governments and the rest of the society should show their
concern for workers laid off from state enterprises and for social
stability and progress, the deputies say.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that some 390,000 unemployed workers
received help from more than 300 re-employment centers in Shanghai
last year, with 230,000 finding jobs. The city has 160,000
registered unemployed workers. Old-age pensions and unemployment
insurance schemes cover more than 98 percent of Shanghai's urban
workers.
</P>
<P>
Chen Zhenhong, a deputy, told the meeting that state-owned
enterprise development cannot rely solely on reducing the number
of workers because massive lay-offs may result in social
instability. Chen and some other deputies proposed limits on the
number of unemployed workers and legislation whereby heads of
enterprises that dismiss workers beyond a certain number be held
accountable.
</P>
<P>
Dan Ancui, another deputy, said that a minimum salary should be
established for places that hire laid-off workers and that local
firms hiring people from outside Shanghai should pay a special fee
to encourage the employment of more local displaced workers.
</P>
<P>
Tang Hui and others urged the government to increase spending
to create more jobs.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are the full
texts of the condolence messages delivered by Israeli President
Ezer Weizman and Knesset (parliament) Speaker Dan Tichon Sunday on
the death of Jordan's King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Weizman's message:
</P>
<P>
"My wife Reuma and I, and all the people of Israel, mourn the
untimely death of His Majesty King Hussein bin Talal, who passed
away after a severe illness. We send our sincere sympathy to his
widow, Queen Noor, to his children, to the family of the Hashemite
Kingdom and to all the people of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein was one of the greatest leaders of the 20th
century, a brave soldier, who fought for peace, a clever man, warm
hearted and the symbol of good neighborly relations. The people of
Israel lament the death of a great friend, a courageous Arab
leader, who was worthy of esteem and free of hatred and a very
human person, who was not afraid to take the long and difficult
path to peace.
</P>
<P>
We, in Israel, and in the whole Middle East, are obliged to
continue his legacy and I am sure that together with crown Prince
Abdullah we will persevere along the road. The State of Israel
seeks peace and I, as its President, will do my utmost to ensure
it.
</P>
<P>
The memory and legacy of the King will always be with us."
</P>
<P>
Tichon's message:
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli Knesset bows its head in great sorrow over the
death of King Hussein of Jordan. This courageous man is no longer
with us and this grieves us greatly. Our neighbors, the Jordanian
people, have lost a great leader. We have lost a wonderful friend,
a true friend. When he chose peace, he did not allow the window of
opportunity to close. He was a staunch defender of peace, and was
not deterred by those opposed it. We will greatly miss this rare
man, whom we loved so much."

HARBIN, February 7 (Xinhua) -- China's northeast China province
of Heilongjiang, a major forestry area in China, has announced
that it has punished more than 1,000 people for illegal timber
operations so far to protect the region's shrinking forest

Some people have been charged with crimes and face possible
imprisonment, police sources say, and 980 cases are under

Unchecked timber cutting caught the media's attention in China

devastating summer floods that killed thousands of people. The
State Council has ordered a halt to this suicidal destruction.

<P>
FUZHOU, February 7 (Xinhua) -- An increasing effort to fight
tax evasion by overseas-funded enterprises in Fuzhou, the capital
of east China's Fujian province, has helped the taxation bureau
get more than 15 million yuan in overdue taxes.
</P>
<P>
Tax collectors audited more than 300 overseas-funded ventures
to examine tax payments, local taxation officials say. This was
first done in 1991, because of increased deficits in local
overseas-funded ventures and an increase in overseas investment,
meaning that some enterprises were evading taxes by fabricating
false corporate reports.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 3,600 overseas-funded enterprises in the
city, whose taxes amount to 870 million yuan. The local taxation
administration has computerized the whole process to deal with the
problem using software it developed.

<HEADLINE> New Fire Alarm System In Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Beijing will take the lead in
China in using a new warning system for fires that was just
approved by a committee of specialists and scholars from the
Academy of Sciences, Academy of Engineering, and other relevant
departments.
</P>
<P>
Beijing families will be warned about fires by a method similar
to weather forecasts, officials say. A computer is used to provide
information about conflagrations in a short period of time by
monitoring the wind force and directions, temperatures, humidity,
and rainfall.
</P>
<P>
This will help people find ways to avoid a fire and inform fire
fighters about possible alerts, officials say.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has had more than 200 additional fires annually since
1990. There were 4,763 fires last year, claiming 40 lives and
causing 42.21 million yuan in damage.

<P>
BONN, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Sunday reaffirmed its
opposition to NATO's eastward expansion at the Security Policy
Conference held in the south German city of Munich.
</P>
<P>
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Yevgeny Guzarov said it was "
not admissible" for countries from the former Soviet Union to
become NATO members.
</P>
<P>
"The red frontier continues to be valid," said Guzarov. He
acknowledged that Moscow did not have a special prerogative but
said it expected its standpoint to be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
The first new east European NATO members, Poland, Hungary and
the Czech Republic, are scheduled to join the alliance in March,
just before it celebrates the 50th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
Guzarov also warned against international missions without a
United Nations mandate, saying that such moves would radically
change the existing "security architecture".
</P>
<P>
He said the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE) could be the "heart" of a security policy for the 21st
century. "There should not be a closed elite club within the Euro-
Atlantic sphere," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Commends Outstanding Care For Elderly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Chen Li, who works in a bicycle
plant, was given the title "filial daughter" by the China National
Committee on Aging (CNCA) today in Beijing, after having taken
care of her parents and parents-in-law for a decade all by herself.
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old woman was given the award because her deed is
thought to be meaningful and necessary for every Chinese family,
which has had or will have elderly members. Her husband was in the
army and was sent far from home after their marriage and she took
on all household work without a complaint.
</P>
<P>
"It is important that we let family members and the whole
society know that the country is an aging society and we should be
prepared for the change," said Doje Cering, Chinese Minister of
Civil Affairs.
</P>
<P>
China will have 130 million people above the age of 60 next
year, or 10 percent of the population. Longer life expectancy and
other factors may increase the number to 400 million in half a
century, but scholars point out that China is far from prepared
for this because it lacks a complete social security network.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to set up a network to support senior citizens, to
provide medicare, to help them avoid loneliness through study and
entertainment, and to encourage them to serve society by using
their abundant knowledge," Doje Cering said.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Yonghao, a 72-year-old retired engineer, was also given an
award today for making full use of his ability at his age. He
began doing various technological research after he retired and
has numerous domestic and overseas patents for his innovations.
</P>
<P>
Zhao and Chen are in fact only two of the 2,500 outstanding
people who were chosen for this third award ceremony. It was
started by CNCA and the Ministry of Civil Affairs and held
ceremonies in 1989 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was more meaningful than the award itself because
it can encourage more young people to work for "a society of all
ages", said Kerstin Leitner, the United Nations resident
coordinator in China.

<HEADLINE> Serbs, Albanians Begin Talks in Rambouillet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RAMBOUILLET, France, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Serb and ethnic
Albanian representatives began negotiations in the chateau of
Rambouillet on Sunday on the peace for Kosovo sponsored by the six-
nation Contact Group.
</P>
<P>
The two delegations representing the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia and the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo began talks with the
international mediators in two separate rooms in the chateau
outside of Paris at 10:00 a.m. local time Sunday, said French
foreign ministry sources.
</P>
<P>
The three international mediators, American ambassador to
Macedonia Christopher Hill, Russian diplomat Boris Mayorski and
Austrian diplomat Wolfgang Pietritsch who represents the European
Union, presented a document on establishing "substantial autonomy"
in Kosovo to the two delegations, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The Serbs refused to have face-to-face talks with some members
of the Albanian delegation, who are considered to be "terrorists"
of the Kosovo Liberation Army, or KLA.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine and British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook, who are co-chairmen of the talks, will be
back to Rambouillet sometime this week to meet with the delegates
of the two sides in order to push them to have direct meetings.
</P>
<P>
France and Britain have insisted that the Yugoslav delegates
talk with all the members of the Albanian delegation.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group has given the two sides one week to accept in
principle the peace proposal and an extra week to make extra
points seeking a political settlement to the 11-month conflict, in
which 2,000 people have been killed.
</P>
<P>
The positions of the two conflicting sides on the peace
proposal are far from each other. The KLA insists on earning
independence for the province, where 90 percent of the population
are ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group proposal calls for high-degree self-rule for
the province, but opposes independence.
</P>
<P>
The Western countries are considering sending up to 30,000
interposing troops to Kosovo once an agreement is reached in
Rambouillet.
</P>
<P>
But Belgrade has rejected the idea of deploying foreign troops
in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Euro, Yen Best for Gulf Currencies to Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 7 (Xinhua) -- With central banks in the
Gulf considering delinking their currencies with the U.S. dollar,
the euro and the yen pose the best prospects, a report by Gulf
News said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"With the euro and the yen emerging as strong alternatives to
the dollar, Gulf countries are likely to place their reserves in
these currencies," the report said, quoting Paul Chertkow, head of
global currency research of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in London.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on Saturday after his presentation at a
seminar organized by the Japanese bank in Abu Dhabi, Chertkow said
the yen has a strong chance of being included in the basket of
currencies of the Gulf because Japan is the largest trading
partner of many Gulf countries including the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
"It makes sense for gulf monetary agencies to consider linking
their currencies to a basket as it provides a more flexible
adjustment mechanism instead of being reliable on just one
currency," he said, echoing the arguments of some Gulf financial
officials.
</P>
<P>
Chertkow said the yen, which is currently strong, is likely to
weaken in the long run. He expected the yen to trade between
105-125 to the dollar in the short term.
</P>
<P>
"The yen has gone to strong levels on a trade-weighted index,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the euro will be a strong rival to the dollar
in the coming years.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Produce Rocket for Launching Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Defense Minister Ali
Shamkhani announced here on Sunday that Iran is to produce a new
rocket designed to launch a satellite into space.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Shamkhani said that the
Shahab-4 (Meteor-4) rocket is at the stage of engine design and
test, and will have no military application.
</P>
<P>
He said that all work pertaining to Shahab-4 rocket will be
accomplished by Iranian experts, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Last July, Iran successfully tested a Shahab-3 missile with a
range of 1,300 kilometers, prompting serious concerns of the
United States and Israel about Iran's ambition to produce weapons
of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Shamkhani said that the Iranian defense industries are now
manufacturing Shahab-3 missiles and its military power will remain
deterrent.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that Iran will not threat any country in the
region and its defense budget in the next Iranian calendar year
starting March 21 has decreased by 1 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
Taking inflation into consideration, this year's defense budget
will be even lower, the minister said. But he did not disclose the
exact figure.
</P>
<P>
Since the structure of the Iranian defense industries and
military equipment is indigenous, the defense capability of the
country will not be subject to the budget reduction, he added.
</P>
<P>
Shamkhani said that next year's defense budget will be oriented
towards beefing up investment in the production of non-military
products.
</P>
<P>
He cited the production of the multi-purpose Shabaviz
helicopter as among other projects of the Iranian defense
industries.
</P>
<P>
The helicopter will fly within the next few days in the
presence of President Mohammad Khatami, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's All People's Party
(APP) has come out with a draft electoral agreement with the
Alliance for Democracy (AD) following the rejection of the
proposed alliance between the two parties by the Independent
National Electoral Commission (INEC).
</P>
<P>
The draft revealed Saturday at an APP National Executive
Committee meeting said that APP and AD would present common
candidates for the offices of president and vice president.
</P>
<P>
The presidential candidate shall come from the party with
higher performance in the Gubernatorial and House of Assembly
elections while the other party will field in the running mate,
according to the draft agreement, The Guardian reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The draft noted that the party nominating the presidential
candidate shall relinquish its registration and adopt the
registration of the other party for the purpose of contesting the
election.
</P>
<P>
For the election to the National Assembly, the two parties
shall field and support joint candidates depending on which party
is "stronger electorally on the ground, at a particular
constituency as shown in the gubernatorial and House of Assembly
elections."
</P>
<P>
INEC Chairman Justice Ephraim Akpata told a press conference
last Friday that the commission had rejected the proposed alliance
between the two parties which had sought to be allowed to field
single candidate in all constituencies in the country for the
National Assembly and presidential elections with their acronym
and logos reflected on a common ballot paper.
</P>
<P>
But, the chairman said any of the two parties is free to field
candidates on the platform of one of the registered political
parties.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing wrong in a presidential candidate sponsored
by one party having a running mate from the other party in the
spirit of the alliance, provided that they run on the ticket of
one of the partners of the alliance," Akpata stressed.
</P>
<P>
Observers said the alliance of the two parties is essential for
them to win the elections for the National Assembly and presidency
scheduled to be held on February 20 and 27 respectively as the
most dominant People's Democratic Party won more than 50 percent
of the votes cast nationwide in the local and state elections held
in December and January.

BONN, February 8 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder is facing a test of support rate on his proposed
immigration reforms after the first regional election began in the
state of Hesse on Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
Polling stations opened at 8 a.m. on Sunday local time

</P>
<P>
Schroeder's new Social Democratic (SPD)-Green government has

moderate Social Democrat who prefers to float ideas and then
gently steer them toward consensus.
</P>
<P>
Roland Koch, 40, the candidate of the opposition Christian
democrats (CDU), belongs to the conservative wing of the CDU and
wants tax cuts, less state and tougher police.
</P>
<P>
The Hesse SPD-Greens government currently polls between 49.5
and 51 per cent, compared to 41.5 to 47 per cent for the CDU and
its Free Democratic (FDP) partner. In 1994 elections the SPD-
Greens won 49.2 per cent while the CDU-FDP lost with 46.6 per cent.
</P>
<P>
Grasping for an issue to batter Eichel, the CDU has based its
campaign on fierce opposition to planned reform of Germany's 1913
nationality law under which being German is based on bloodlines -
not place of birth. Schroeder plans to grant automatic citizenship
to most foreign children born in Germany and to allow dual-
nationality.
</P>
<P>
"Ja to integration. NEIN to dual-nationality!" are the election
posters hung up by CDU candidate Koch.
</P>
<P>
The CDU has launched a national petition opposing dual-
nationality and has gathered 200,000 "nein" signatures alone in
Hesse. The regional vote is thus a triple test of acceptance for
Schroeder's reform; overall support for red-Green; and also of
whether the CDU can pull out of its post-election defeat doldrums.
</P>
<P>
Should Eichel and the Greens be defeated in Hesse, it would
impact on Bonn. Schroeder's SPD would lose its majority of 38 of
the 69 seats in the Bundesrat, parliament's upper chamber.
Nevertheless, a Koch victory would still only give the Christian
Democratic alliance 21 seats, far short of a majority.
</P>
<P>
Hesse is financially the strongest of Germany's 16 federal
states and has a jobless rate of 8.7 per cent -- below the
national average of 11 per cent.

AMMAN, February 7 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan died of
lymphatic cancer at 11:43 local time (0943 GMT) Sunday in his
sickbed in King Hussein Medical Center at the age of 63, an
official announcement read on TV said.
</P>
<P>
The king left a U.S. hospital Thursday to return to Jordan
after a second and fatally failed bone marrow transplant as part
of the treatment for his lymphatic cancer.
</P>
<P>
Hussein, born November 14, 1935, was crowned king on May 2,
1953. With 46 years on the throne, he was the longest-ruling
monarch in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
In mid-January, Hussein returned Jordan, officially claimed
cured of his cancer, and named his eldest son Abdullah as
successor to the Hashimite throne after removing his brother
Hassan.
</P>
<P>
But a week later, he was sent back to the United States due to
a relapse of cancer.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, with the king dying, the Cabinet declared Abdullah
regent, granting him most political and royal powers.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Feature: Jordanians Brave Cold Night to Pray for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Chilling winds whistle through
the dim-lit Amman streets in the small hours of Sunday, hundreds
of Jordanians are still waiting outside a hospital for a
miracle: the ailing King Hussein may rise again from the sickbed.
</P>
<P>
It is a second sleepless night for those outside the King
Hussein Medical Center, where the 63-year-old monarch is
hospitalized since his return home Friday morning from a
U.S. hospital after a second and fatally unsuccessful bone marrow
transplant as part of lymphatic cancer treatments.
</P>
<P>
They are praying for Hussein, who has been fighting a battle
against the cancer for almost seven months and for the moment is
barely alive on a respirator with most of his internal organs
having failed except a weak heart.
</P>
<P>
Hung on the semi-arched door of the hospital is a giant
portrait of Hussein, in a black suit with a red necktie, young and
energetic.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Jordanians are gathering under the portrait, which
they hope to light up with candles in their hands. Occasionally
and rhythmically, they chant slogans as "God bless our king with
a recovery," or "We are with our king."
</P>
<P>
Sorrow is apparently written on the face of the forty-year-old
Biyader Wadi, who is standing at the stairs to the gate of the
hospital. With tears in her eyes, she told Xinhua that "King
Hussein is not only our monarch, but also our dear father or
brother."
</P>
<P>
Wadi, who had stayed up for two consecutive nights outside the
hospital, is eager for any encouraging news on the king's health,
but the news never turns up.
</P>
<P>
A large crowd of people are gathering in front the gate,
standing in lines with their hands open up in the air and praying
for Hussein in all their concentration regardless of the
disturbances from the cars passing by.
</P>
<P>
Opposite to the hospital, dozens of young men are sitting
around a campfire, which they lit up to stay up till sunrise.
</P>
<P>
Among them is a depressed Zayeed Musa from a remote desert
tribe in the kingdom. "All I can do for him now is to pray, that's
why I have been here," the 30-year-old Musa, also on his second
day here, said.
</P>
<P>
Firas Nasser, 21, is also sitting around the fire. He feels
indebted to Hussein because the king permitted the issue of
Jordanian passports to Palestinians like him.
</P>
<P>
"Now I can go to Jerusalem, the holy city, with the Jordanian
passport," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lights from distant houses are still glittering in the early
morning, more Jordanians are staying up for news on Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Another day is dawning on Jordan.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Beat China in Davis Cup Tie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, February 7 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand proved why they
are seeded at Davis Cup tennis here Sunday when they edged
fighting China 3-2 in the first round of Asian-Oceania Zone.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand sailed into the second round and will take on the
winners of the match between top seed India and South Korea slated
for 11-13 while the losers will face China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team captain, Wang Fuzhang, was not surprised about
the results. However, he found the weak points through his team's
performance at the Mission Hills' Centre Court.
</P>
<P>
"To tell the truth, we are not competitive to the New
Zealanders, especially at net and serve," said Wang who has
captained Chinese team for 13 years.
</P>
<P>
Jeff Simpson, captain of New Nealand, said: "the Chinese
younsters looks good for the future, especially their fighting
spirit and groundstrokes."
</P>
<P>
"The only thing they lack is to compete in more matches," added
Jeff, a former Davis Cup player for his country.
</P>
<P>
In the first reverse singles serve-and-volly player Alistair
Hunt, who replaced injured New Zealand number one player Brett
Steven, could not coped with 19-year-old debutant Zhu Benqiang's
angled placements and was forced to make too many mistakes.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, ranked 791th, beat world ranked 411 Alistair 6-4, 7-6 (8-6)
, 2-6 and 6-3 in 2 hours and 45 minutes, putting the two team
level at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
Then the second reverse singles became the rubber of the tie.
</P>
<P>
The 380th Mark Nielsen, who are ranked second in his country,
never gave any chances to 23-year-old Zhang Yu. The 21-year-old
New Zealand hopeful came out firing on all cylinders and dominated
the whole match with his trademark -- hard groundstroke, securing
his team victory with a score of 6-1, 6-3, 6-4.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM Visits Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Salim
Hoss left here on Sunday on his maiden official visit to Saudi
Arabia since he came to power at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to Hoss said that the prime minister will hold a
series of talks with Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz, Crown Prince
Abdullah, Defense Minister Prince Sultan and Foreign Minister
Prince Saud Al-Faisal on bilateral ties and regional affairs.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day visit, Hoss will also meet with officials
of Saudi Arabia's Chamber of Commerce and the Saudi Development
Fund (SDF) on encouraging investment in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"I will not ask Saudi officials to give Lebanon any financial
aid. This is up to them. But I will discuss the possibility of
financing some projects with the officials of SDF and Islamic Bank
for Development," the prime minister said in an TV interview.
</P>
<P>
Hoss' visit aims to head off a possible backlash in foreign
investments into the country due to the exit from power of the
billionaire ex-premier Rafik Hariri.
</P>
<P>
Hariri's good personal relationship with leaders of some
foreign countries, especially France and Saudi Arab, had helped
attract sizable investments in the country's
multi-billion-U.S.-dollar drive to rebuild Lebanon from the debris
of the 1975-1990 civil war.
</P>
<P>
Hoss was designated by the newly elected President Emile
Lahoud as premier last December after Hariri refused to stay in
office after having served a six-year mandate under the
ex-President Elias Hrawi.

</P>
<P>
Increasing population pressure and chopping of wood for fuel
make Tanzania lose 300,000 to 400,000 hectares of forests a year,
environmentalists said.
</P>
<P>
Lowassa, who addressed the 20th session of the United Nations
Environmental Governing Council Wednesday in Nairobi, Kenya, also
said water hyacinth is posing threats to Lake Victoria, the
largest in Africa, affecting millions of Tanzanians depending on
it for survival.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Lowassa said the obnoxious weed has suffocated fish
and affected water transportation for domestic and industrial uses
in riparian regions like Mwanza.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said climatic variability is not only
threatening the existence of various ecosystems that shaped the
biological wealth of Tanzania, but also threatening to cripple
agricultural production which is virtually at the nature's mercy.
He was referring to El Nino and La Nina weather phenomena which
have caused food problems for three consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
As the world is entering the next century, he said, developing
countries are particularly vulnerable to environmental problems
for lack of handling capacity.
</P>
<P>
He named the problems as land degradation, lack of accessible
good quality water, increasing environmental pollution, drastic
loss of wildlife habitats and biodiversity, deterioration of
aquatic ecosystems, rampant deforestation, increasing climatic
variability and bio-invasions.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania is renowned for its vast wildlife resources but
poaching and other human activities have greatly reduced the
animals' number. To control the situation, the National Assembly
finally ratified earlier this week two international conventions
to protect migratory wild animals and conserve wetlands.
</P>
<P>
The minister appealed to the international community to help
developing countries like Tanzania which are in a difficult
position to cope with emerging global environmental challenges.

can be shared by many other countries just beginning to fight the
epidemic.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government was moved by the prediction that over 40
million children worldwide will be orphaned by AIDS by the year
2000, she noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 7 (Xinhua) -- More than 32,000 bags of relief
maize are urgently required to cater for over 8,000 destitute
families threatened with starvation in Wajir town, North Eastern
Province, the People newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A drought assessment report prepared by the drought monitoring
 committee said the situation in Wajir is grave and fear of
starvation looms large in the region as famine takes a turn for
the worse.
</P>
<P>
The number of destitute families in the district might increase
in the next four months as all the water points dried up and food
is hard to come by, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report called for the immediate increase of relief
allocation in Wajir up from 1,500 bags to 100,000 bags. It also
recommended urgent drilling of more bore holes and the
rehabilitation of those destroyed by the El Nino.
</P>
<P>
The report is the latest in a series of alarming reports from
Garissa, Wajir and Mandera, all districts in the North Easter
Province.
</P>
<P>
Since early January, quite a number of areas in eastern,
northern and southwestern Kenya have been hit by severe drought
due to poor rains during the October-December short rain season,
which caused food shortage in these areas.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has taken urgent measures for relief
work. In mid- January, the government decided to allocate 400
million Shillings (about 6. 7 million U.S. Dollars) to purchase
maize for the drought-inflicted areas.

<HEADLINE> 3 U.N. Peacekeepers Wounded in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Three United Nations peacekeepers
serving in south Lebanon were wounded Sunday morning in Israeli
shelling on the border villages, the National Broadcasting Network
radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The three Irish soldiers of the U.N. Interim Forces in South
Lebanon (UNIFIL) was injured in Hadaith on the border of the
Israeli occupied zone in south Lebanon during the Israeli
bombardment.
</P>
<P>
This is the first casualties the UNIFIL suffered since the
start of this year. The 4,500-strong troops consisting of
soldiers from nine countries were established in 1978 after the
first Israeli invasion of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the border zone in south Lebanon where Israel set
up a self-declared security zone witnessed the most fierce
conflicts since the beginning of this year between Lebanese
guerrillas and Israeli occupation forces and its allied South
Lebanon Army (SLA).
</P>
<P>
One SLA millitiaman was killed and another wounded in a
roadside bomb planted by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party
of God, in the village of Houla inside the central sector of the
zone.
</P>
<P>
In response, SLA artillery forces pounded several villages in
the central and eastern sector, wounding at least 15 Lebanese
civilians, including 12 in Majdal Silm and three in Rihan.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss Saturday night contacted
with ambassadors of the five permanent members of the
U.N. Security Council in Lebanon to seek international
intervention in a bid to avert an escalation of violence in the
area.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean President Criticizes Judges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe has called on judges that want to assume political roles to
quit the Bench and join or form political parties, The Sunday Mail
newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Giving a special address to the nation on Saturday night,
Mugabe warned that when judges assumed both a judicial and
quasi-political role, then what suffered was their judicial
function.
</P>
<P>
The president said this in apparent reference to a recent
petition by three Supreme Court judges, copied to several Cabinet
ministers and individuals, in which they protested against the
detention by the military of two Standard weekly journalists,
editor Mark Chavunduka and reporter Ray Choto, after they
published an alleged coup story.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Vice-President Simon Muzenda received three petitions
from three judges, in which they expressed concern over the
alleged violation of rule of law by the government.
</P>
<P>
Justice Adam of the High Court also addressed a similar
petition to the president.
</P>
<P>
The judges said Mugabe should reaffirm the rule of law by
making a public statement on allegations of torture to the two
journalists.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said the Standard newspaper falsely claimed that there
had been a coup plot involving some members of the army.
"Publishers of the Standard knew that the story was blatantly
untrue, they knew they had not a single shred of evidence that the
alleged plot had occurred. Their heinous objective was to plant
an idea of a coup thereby causing disaffection in the army and to
instil alarm and despondency in the peace-loving people of
Zimbabwe."
</P>
<P>
"The reaction of the army was that of real shock and anger for
they knew that what had been published was untrue. The army
wanted the cause of that untruth investigated. Propelled by their
unquestionable loyalty and commitment to the defense and security
of the state, they went to the source of the falsehood and
arrested those who had manufactured it," the president added.

<TEXT>
<P>
SAN SALVADOR, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Salvadoran coffee
producers say they would lose some 45 million U.S. dollars as the
result of high local production costs and the low international
prices.
</P>
<P>
Ruben Pineda, chairman of the Salvadoran Coffee Council, said
Saturday the Brazilian decision to increase its export quota from
1.5 million to 2 million 60-kilo bags has upset the Central
American exports.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, coffee prices was further down as the market was
closed at 104 dollars per bag, down 21 dollars from the opening.
</P>
<P>
Pineda told the "La Prensa Grafica" morning newspaper that if
the trend continues, El Salvador will record exporting reduction
of more than 400 million kilograms of coffee worth about 45
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
As coffee prices "are on the floor", said Elena Bolanos,
president of El Salvador Coffee Association, an urgent meeting of
the Coffee Producing Countries Association (APC) is needed to
redefine marketing regulations.

<P>
Local meteorologists attribute the phenomenon to the warm
winter with temperatures some three degrees centigrade higher than
normal.
</P>
<P>
They note that the higher winter temperature resulted from
abnormal atmospheric circulation, weak cold air fronts from the
north and air pollution.
</P>
<P>
The warm winter has also caused the earlier arrival of the dry
season along some rivers in the region, with water quality
deteriorating due to water shortages.

<P>
BONN, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The two warring parties in Kosovo
must reach a peace agreement through the ongoing talks in France,
said German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on Saturday at the 35th
Conference on International Security in Munich.
</P>
<P>
As Bonn is ready to join the international community in
securing peace in Kosovo by military means, Schroeder said, the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) should maintain its
tough position in seeking a peaceful end to the crisis there.
</P>
<P>
"The international community won't tolerate killings in Kosovo
any more," he said, adding the Western military bloc can take
military actions against the trouble-making side if there is once
again a massacre in the troubled Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
Also at the two-day conference, German Minister of Defense
Rudolf Scharping said the country's federal defense forces will
make further and better preparation for participating in possible
NATO military operations in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the meeting, NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana said the talks beginning Saturday in Paris must succeed in
reaching a peace accord.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Minister William Cohen said NATO military attack
is pending if Serbian authorities and ethnic Albanians fail to
sign a pact.
</P>
<P>
The 16-nation NATO has threatened air strikes against Yugoslav
targets while stepping up financial and military pressure on
separatist ethnic Albanian forces.

<P>
DHAKA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is
being deprived of an annual revenue earnings amounting to about
3.5 billion taka (72.2 million U.S. dollars) due to unbridled
smuggling of sugar from neighboring countries, a daily newspaper
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Of the annual domestic requirement for 600,000 tons, 120,000
tons of sugar is produced locally while the government imports
about 130,000 tons, The New Nation quoted sources of the
Bangladesh Wholesale Sugar Merchant Association (BWSMA) as saying.
</P>
<P>
The rest of about 350,000 tons of sugar is being smuggled into
the domestic markets from neighboring countries, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
"Smuggling of lower quality and adulterated sugar into the
country should be checked forthwith for the very survival of the
country's sugar industry, sugar merchants, sugarcane producers and
protection of the national economy and health policy," the news
quoted the sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The BWSMA has urged the authorities concerned to take immediate

<HEADLINE> Paraguay to Explore Markets Outside Mercosur </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Paraguayan President Raul
Cubas said Saturday his country will have to explore markets
outside the South American Common Market (Mercosur) if the
Brazilian economic crisis worsens.
</P>
<P>
As member of Mercosur together with Argentina, Brazil and
Uruguay, said Cubas, Paraguay had other markets before the birth
of the regional commercial bloc four years ago.
</P>
<P>
And for now, he said, "If the economic conditions in Mercosur
are not the best for our products, we have to look for markets
where our products will have better conditions for their sale."
</P>
<P>
The Paraguayan president is scheduled to visit Brazil and
discuss with his counterpart, Fernando Henrique Cardos, on the
adverse effects of the devaluation of the Brazilian real in
January.
</P>
<P>
Cubas said his meeting with Cardos would focus on the impact of
the Brazilian crisis on the region, and the possibility of calling
as soon as possible a Mercosur summit.
</P>
<P>
The first negative effects of the Brazilian crisis on Paraguay,
he said, have been the reduction of the country's exports to
Brazil and its massive import of Brazilian products due to their
low prices.

<HEADLINE> Salvadoran Coffee Producers Foresee 45 Million Dollars Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN SALVADOR, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Salvadoran coffee
producers say they would lose some 45 million U.S. dollars as the
result of high local production costs and the low international
prices.
</P>
<P>
Ruben Pineda, chairman of the Salvadoran Coffee Council, said
Saturday the Brazilian decision to increase its export quota from
1.5 million to 2 million 60-kilo bags has upset the Central
American exports.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, coffee prices was further down as the market was
closed at 104 dollars per bag, down 21 dollars from the opening.
</P>
<P>
Pineda told the "La Prensa Grafica" morning newspaper that if
the trend continues, El Salvador will record exporting reduction
of more than 400 million kilograms of coffee worth about 45
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
As coffee prices "are on the floor", said Elena Bolanos,
president of El Salvador Coffee Association, an urgent meeting of
the Coffee Producing Countries Association (APC) is needed to
redefine marketing regulations.

<HEADLINE> Argentina Hails Brazil's Decision to Remove Export Subsidies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President Carlos
Menem on Saturday said Brazil's decision to eliminate subsidies
for its exports to the Southern Common Market (Mercosur) will help
consolidate the regional bloc.
</P>
<P>
Describing the Brazilian government's move to cut the funding
for its special support program for exports destined to other
Mercosur countries as "a healthy measure," Menem said it is
expected to make the bloc more coherent.
</P>
<P>
For the time, Brazil's Mercosur partners, including Argentina,
Paraguay and Uruguay, are concerned of the flooding of Brazilian
products into its market triggered by the devaluation of Brazil's
currency, the real, starting from January.
</P>
<P>
Menem said Argentina and Brazil work together for Mercosur to
continue growing and to prevent asymmetries that could damage some
countries of the region.
</P>
<P>
He insisted on his proposal of a single currency for Mercosur,
saying the new monetary system would benefit all the countries of
the bloc in the long run.

<HEADLINE> Nations to Adopt U.N. Biosecurity Protocol in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Delegates from 152
countries are expected to adopt the Biosecurity Protocol of the
United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity on February 22-
23.
</P>
<P>
To be finalized at the Colombian city of Cartagena, the
protocol sets forth international security standards for handling
genetic codes, and the use and cross-border transportation of
genetically modified organisms (GMOs).
</P>
<P>
It also assures that the genetic engineering of GMOs in
laboratories will not put at risk the health and food supply
security of the world.
</P>
<P>
The protocol has been drafted by a panel of experts since 1995,
when the task force met for the first time in Madrid, Spain. It
was almost finished at a meeting in Montreal, Canada, last
September.
</P>
<P>
A third meeting of the panel is scheduled for February 14
through 23, before the adoption of the protocol at a special
session of signatories of the United Nations Convention on
Biological Diversity.
</P>
<P>
The panel discussion would take place in Cartagena.
</P>
<P>
The special session thereafter would be attended by
representatives of non-governmental organizations, indigenous
groups and academic circles.
</P>
<P>
Signed at the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and
Development in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the U.N. Convention on
Biological Diversity went in effect in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Margarita Florez, Colombia coordinator of the Latin American
Institute of Legal Services' (ILSA) Environmental Program, told
the press that the protocol has been reduced to matters directed
to the cross-border movement of GMOs.
</P>
<P>
Florez said the creation of a protocol has been designed to
protect the planet's biological diversity, of which a great part
is in developing nations.

<HEADLINE> China Telecom Break-up Hailed as Breakthrough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The anticipated restructuring
of telecommunications giant China Telecom, confirmed by
Information Industry Minister Wu Jichuan has been hailed as a
breakthrough in the field.
</P>
<P>
According to today's Business Weekly, the scheme proposes
splitting China Telecom into three parts, namely, paging, mobile
communications and fixed-line networks.
</P>
<P>
"This can be cited as a model for the antitrust drive in other
industrial sectors," Ma Yu, an analyst with the Research Institute
of International Trade, was quoted by the English-language paper
as saying.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the government set up China United Telecommunications
Corp. (China Unicom) to rival the mammoth China Telecom in an
effort to act as a counter to the monopoly.
</P>
<P>
Suffering from a lack of capital and market access, however,
China Unicom still cannot compete with China Telecom on a level
playing field.
</P>
<P>
"The proposed break-up is encouraging and we have already made
preparations to expand our business," said Lu Jianguo, vice-
president of China Unicom.
</P>
<P>
Splitting up China Telecom can also be attributed to the
enthusiastic participation of consumers.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of lawsuits have been filed by consumers across the
country claiming telecom operators charge unreasonable fees for
such items as line installation and extra charges for basic mobile
communications services.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, consumers will benefit from the break-up despite
the risk of moving from a situation of one monopoly to three," an
industry insider said.

<P>
COLOMBO, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The cause of a recent
helicopter crash that killed five people in the Maldives was still
not known, said reports reaching here from Male Sunday, quoting a
Maldivian security official.
</P>
<P>
The helicopter ferrying foreign tourists crashed into the sea
minutes after taking off from Maldivian Hilton resort at Rangali
island in the South Ari Atoll, killing four foreign tourists and
one Maldivian.
</P>
<P>
"The cause of the accident has not been determined and it is
too early to speculate," a Maldivian newspaper report said,
quoting a senior National Security Service official.
</P>
<P>
There were 20 people on board the helicopter which crashed into
a 10-foot deep lagoon. They were being ferried to the airport to
depart after their Maldivian holiday, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Among the survivors were nine Maldivians who were mainly resort
staff, three foreign tourists and three Bulgarian crew.
</P>
<P>
The reports added that the Maldivian Department of Civil
Aviation had suspended operations of the Hummingbird Island
Airways following the helicopter crash.
</P>
<P>
The Russian-built helicopter which crashed was of the same type
involved in a similar accident in 1993 when another helicopter
went into the sea killing eight foreign tourists and one
Maldivian.

<P>
BONN, February 6 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer called Saturday for a peace conference on the south
Balkans to resolve once and for all tensions tearing the region
apart.
</P>
<P>
Fischer told the 35th World Security Policy Conference that
once the fighting has been stopped in the Yugoslav province of
Kosovo, it would be "indispensable (to have) a peace conference on
the south Balkans."
</P>
<P>
Bosnia, Croatia, Macedonia, Albania and also Serbia should
attend such a conference for an "integrated and peaceful Europe in
the future," he said at the two-day Munich gathering of officials
of over 20 countries.
</P>
<P>
Fischer also expressed concerns over the "weak leadership" of
the United Nations shown in handling some international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts in Kosovo make it clear that sometimes military
actions are needed to stop human catastrophe, but generally
speaking, such actions should be authorized by the United Nations,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Interference by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
without the authorization by the United Nations will be
implemented only when it is "absolutely necessary," Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting are some 200 senior defense experts and
defense or foreign affairs ministers from more than 20 countries,
including U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen, as well as NATO
Secretary General Javier Solana.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, there is an Asian representation in the
meeting, with the attendance of Chinese foreign ministry official

<P>
YANGON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- A new modern terminal of
Myanmar's Kawthoung Airport in southern Tanintharyi division
bordering Thailand has been commissioned into service to

The upgrading work of the runway started again in 1992, making
it now possible for the safe landing of Boeing 737.
</P>
<P>
There are 43 air fields under the Department of Civil Aviation

<HEADLINE> Three Killed in Bomb Blast in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Three ethnic Albanians were
killed as a bomb blasted in Kosovo hours after the warring sides
started peace talks Saturday in Paris under the pressure of the
international Contact Group.
</P>
<P>
The blast occurred at a grocery in Pristina, capital of the
mainly Albanian province of Yugoslavia, at 19:00 local time (1800
GMT), killing the grocery owner and a 16-year-old youth on the
spot, the Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Another young man was seriously injured and died on the way to
hospital.
</P>
<P>
Ivica Mihajlavic, director of the provincial press office, was
quoted as saying the slain grocery owner was a "decent and
respectable person loyal to the Serbian Republic," whose customers
are mainly Serbs and Montenegrins.
</P>
<P>
He strongly condemned the terrorist act and expressed deep
condolences to the victims' families.
</P>
<P>
The killing is expected to shadow the peace talks which opened
at Rambouillet, on the outskirts of Paris, in the late afternoon
on Saturday with the participation of delegations representing the
Yugoslav government and ethnic Albanian separatists.
</P>
<P>
The talks were proposed by the six-nation Contact Group last
month at a meeting in London, as part of an effort to end the 11-
month Kosovo crisis that so far has left 2,000 people dead and
tens of thousands left homeless.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group is composed of the United States, Britain,
Germany, Italy, Russia and France.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Speed up Repatriation of Cambodian Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will speed up the
repatriation of remaining Cambodian refugees in the country now
that peace has largely been restored and a government has been in
place in Cambodia, according to the National Security Council of
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Kachadpai Buruspat, secretary general of the council, was
quoted Sunday by the Bangkok Post as saying that a meeting would
soon be held with agencies concerned to accelerate the
repatriation process.
</P>
<P>
"It's time they go home to lead a normal life," he said, adding
that the refugees could go back on their own or with the help of
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the UNHCR said in Geneva that the number of
Cambodian refugees in Thailand has fallen below 20,000 for the
first time in nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
Some 11,000 Cambodians have returned from the Phu Noi camp in
Thailand over the last two weeks, said Judith Kumin, spokesman for
the UNHCR.
</P>
<P>
Phu Noi was closed on Tuesday after its final 1,000 occupants
returned to their homeland. The refugees, mostly family members of
Khmer Rouge guerrillas, had been in Thailand since a Cambodian
government offensive that captured their last major stronghold at
Anlong Veng.
</P>
<P>
Some 19,500 Cambodians remain in camps at Huay Cherng and Chong
Khao Phlu. The UNHCR hopes the latter's residents can start
returning next Friday, Kumin said.

JAKARTA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI)
Chief Gen. Wiranto has reiterated that the ABRI will be neutral in
the forthcoming general election scheduled for June 7 this year,
Antara news agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto said he had reiterated the ABRI's stand during a
commander's call attended by chiefs of military districts, chiefs
of police district commands and other ranking officers at the ABRI
headquarters on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"During the commander's call, I instructed all ABRI members
from the highest rank down to the lowest one to implement the new
policy in which the ABRI will be neutral in the forthcoming
general election," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto said there had been many news reports which
misconstrued the ABRI's stand on the general election despite the
fact that he had repeatedly explained it.
</P>
<P>
During the forthcoming general election, the ABRI would treat
all political contestants equally and would not help or act in

<HEADLINE> China's Cordless Phone Production Expected to Surge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 7 (Xinhua) -- China's telephone makers,
encouraged by ballooning demand in both domestic and overseas
markets, are paying more attention to developing cordless
telephones to bolster their position in the new century.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the slowdown in economic growth and the occurrence of
natural disasters last year, the telephone industry continued to
grow strongly," an official with the Ministry of the Information
Industry was quoted by today's Business Weekly as saying.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that China had more than 100 million
telephone users last year, about 20 million of them using cordless
telephones.
</P>
<P>
"The tremendous market potential for cordless telephones has
encouraged more and more telephone makers to concentrate on these
products," the official said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the current penetration rate for telephones
in China is only 10.64 percent, compared with more than 60 percent
in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Li Jiansheng, general manager of TCL Communications Equipment
Co. Ltd., said upgrading the quality and function of cordless
telephones are the key factors enhancing domestic phone makers'
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
In addition, comparatively low prices will help domestic
telephone makers win back market share from their foreign
counterparts, experts say.
</P>
<P>
China now has more than 370 enterprises manufacturing
telephones. The annual phone output exceeds 100 million, more than
half of which are sold in developed countries and regions like the
United States and Japan.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Form Special Task Forces to Deal With Riots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI)
Chief Gen. Wiranto said he would form special task forces to deal
with rampant riots which had caused public unrest and impaired the
country's image in the international community, Antara news agency
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The conditions have caused public unrest. If they are left
uncontrolled, they will disturb the reform process or the solution
of various problems faced by the nation," Wiranto said.
</P>
<P>
The ABRI had therefore decided to be proactive in handling
various riots in several parts of the country by forming special
task forces which would not only prevent widespread riots
especially in remote areas, but also disclose the masterminds of
the riots, he said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The decision to form special task forces followed the ABRI
chief's instruction to police officers to firmly deal with anyone
found guilty of violating the law at the expense of the public at
large.
</P>
<P>
The measures include shoot-on-sight orders for anyone found
guilty of vandalizing, torching or destroying national assets,
physically attacking other people and resorting to violence to
defy law enforcers.
</P>
<P>
"This instruction will apply to all parts of Indonesia,
especially those susceptible to law violation," Wiranto was quoted
by Antara as saying.
</P>
<P>
The task forces would be similar to quick reaction troops who
are trained to safeguard vital projects which are susceptible to
internal and external threats, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto added, however, that since the task forces would not
face external threats, they would concentrate on operations aimed
at preventing riots from spreading further, take repressive
measures to establish the cause of problems and impose
proportional legal sanctions on rioters.
</P>
<P>
"Even the task forces will totally disclose what is the actual
motive behind such cases," he said.
</P>
<P>
Riots have erupted in many parts of Indonesia since former
president Soeharto stepped down in May last year. Religious
leaders have cited reports that thugs and hoodlums of a Jakarta
organization were involved in the recent riots, but neither the
organization nor its leaders have been named.

<HEADLINE> China's Investment Policies to Remain Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 7 (Xinhua) -- China's foreign investment
policies will remain relatively stable and the so-called changes
will be improvement of environment, Sunday's "Business Weekly"
quoted Chinese trade officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
Shi Guangsheng, minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation (MOFTEC), said his ministry will focus on solving
problems for foreign investors this year in a bid to create a
stable investment environment for foreign businesses.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will step up efforts to improve the working
efficiency and service quality of government institutions, and
establish complaint-coordination centers for foreign entrepreneurs
this year.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC Assistant Minister Ma Xiuhong said the ministry will
try harder to eliminate the unreasonable charges, fines and
inspections currently imposed on foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
China redoubles its efforts to refine its investment
environment because it is facing mounting difficulties in
absorbing foreign investment this year as fallout from the Asian
financial turmoil has driven down the growth rate of global cross-
border direct investment flows, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Investment from Asia will continue to shrink this year and
the rate of actual capital injection into approved projects will
also decline," Ma said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, china's contractual investment from Asia plunged 13.
4 percent from the previous year to 436.7 billion U.S. dollars.
This accounts for 82.9 percent of the total, 9.74 percentage
points lower than in 1997. Materialized investment from Asia also
fell 9.27 percent to 209.2 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Despite these difficulties, China is still a big attraction
for foreign investors due to China's stable political and social
situation, a rapidly growing national economy and a stable
currency, Ma stressed.

<HEADLINE> Analysis: New Strategy to Boost Foreign Trade (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The strategy is in line with the national strategic move of "
using science and education to revitalize the nation," and will be
an important guarantee for achieving the nation's cross-century
targets for foreign trade and economic cooperation, according to
Shi Guangsheng, minister of Foreign Trade and economic Cooperation
(MOFTEC). Shi made the statement during an exclusive interview
with Xinhua Sunday.
</P>
<P>
State Council leaders have affirmed the strategy which Shi
announced during the National Conference on Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation late January.
</P>
<P>
The strategy centers on using the international market to help
transform technological advances into exportable products and
increasing exports of hi-tech and new technology commodities.
</P>
<P>
The new strategy is based on China's rapidly growing foreign
trade and economic cooperation as seem since the implementation of
the open policy two decades ago. The growth rate for the foreign
trade volume has far outstripped the rate of national economic
growth during the period.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts point out that the proportion of exports of
hi-tech and new technology products accounts for only a small part
in China's overall export volume, and does not match China's
international status as a major trading nation.

<TEXT>
<P>
China has achieved remarkable progress in enhancing its overall
economic strength and achieving comprehensive technological
advances over the past several years, with the general scientific
level higher for most other developing nations. Shi pointed to the
"vast potential" for exports of hi-tech goods, but nonetheless
noted that China continues to lag behind some other nations in
certain fields.
</P>
<P>
For example, India exported computer software valued at 1.75
billion US dollars in 1997, the second highest volume in the world
following the United States and 12 times China's export of such
products for the year.
</P>
<P>
"In the final analysis, the technological level is truly what
matters in international trade competition," said Shi. "Using
science and technology to achieve cross-century sustainable
development is an immediate task facing China's foreign trade
sector."
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC plans to cooperate with the Ministry of Science and
Technology and other government departments to formulate policies
to apply scientific achievements and increase exports of hi-tech
products.
</P>
<P>
In addition, MOFTEC and other relevant departments will use the
convenient Hong Kong market to expand exports of hi-tech and new
technological products.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC will also designate pilot hi-tech and new technology
industrial parks in qualified areas for studies related to exports
of hi-tech products.
</P>
<P>
In early January, MOFTEC and several other Chinese ministries
decided to hold an annual hi-tech trade fair in south China's
Shenzhen Special Economic Zone beginning this year. The inaugural
fair will be held from October 5-10.

<HEADLINE> China to Set Up New Export Insurance Body </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, February 7 (Xinhua) -- China plans to restructure the
current export insurance structure to boost its exports, according
to today's Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
The new institution, which is under discussion by relevant
departments and companies, will conduct export credit insurance
according to government policy, and the premium reserve will
directly come from the State treasury, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
Now, the current business involving export credit insurance
are handled by the People's Insurance Company of China (PICC), a
state-owned insurer, and the Eximbank.
</P>
<P>
However, China needs a long-term development strategy to
stimulate its exports, but the current situation is not suitable
for the strategy, the paper pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The PICC, as a commercial insurance company with profitability
as its objective, cannot offer a good environment for the
development of export credit insurance.
</P>
<P>
Although Eximbank has a department involving export credit
insurance, the department is guided and funded by the bank, the
paper said, adding that the State has ordered that banks should be
separated from insurance and securities business in term of their
operations.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the establishment of the new institution will
certainty have positive effect on the development of export credit
insurance and spur the country's exports, according to the paper.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Upset Germany 3-0 in Soccer Friendly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The American men's national
soccer team, the last finishers in the World Cup last summer,
surprised everyone today with a solid 3-0 victory over the
European champions Germany in an exhibition game in Florida, the
United States.
</P>
<P>
It was the first victory for the U.S. team under new coach
Bruce Arena and its first in seven games since a 2-0 win over
Kuwait last May 24. Germany, three-time world champions, hammered
the United States 2-0 in the World Cup. It was the first time for
the U.S. team to beat Germany in four games between the Nations.
</P>
<P>
Jovan Kirovski, Tony Sanneh and Claudio Reyna -- all three play
for German clubs -- scored in the first half within a span of 10
minutes.
</P>
<P>
The Americans controlled the game from the start, dominating
the opening 10 minutes completely.
</P>
<P>
Kirovski, who plays for Cologne in Germany's second division,
found the net in the 16th minute with a corner shot.
</P>
<P>
Sanneh, who joined Bundesliga club Hertha Berlin last month,
hit the target in the 24th minute before Reyna winding up the
scoring spree two minutes later with the final goal.
</P>
<P>
The Germans, who were knocked out of running by Croatia in the
quarterfinals at the World Cup, looked pale and slow, creating few
scoring chances.
</P>
<P>
German coach Erich Ribbeck brought only a few veterans, most
notably 37-year-old sweeper Lothar Matthaeus and attacking
midfielder Andreas Moeller for the U.S. tour.
</P>
<P>
The German Soccer Federation has so much influence, it was able
to convince Lufthansa to re-route its daily scheduled flight, from
Frankfurt to Miami, to Jacksonville instead.
</P>
<P>
The team and large delegation are staying at a five-star Ritz-
Carlton on posh Amelia Island.
</P>
<P>
Arena began coaching with scoreless ties against Australia and
Bolivia.

<HEADLINE> Botha Says Tyson's Punishment Too Hard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Francois Botha of South
Africa, who was knocked out by Mike Tyson three weeks ago, said
today the punishment on the former heavyweight champion was too
hard.
</P>
<P>
"What he did was wrong maybe, but I think the punishment he is
receiving is really too hard," Botha said.
</P>
<P>
Tyson, 32, received a surprisingly one-year sentence Friday in
Maryland for assaulting two motorists after a minor traffic
accident last August. He pleaded no contest to the charges in
December.
</P>
<P>
Botha, who was floored by Tyson in the fifth round during
Tyson's comeback fight, said he sympathizes with Tyson.
</P>
<P>
"People really think that Mike is an animal. They say, 'Look
at the way he acts, look at the way he talks.' But I think if you
get to really know him, he's really not that bad," Botha said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The American soccer
governing body is planing to invite the Iran men's national soccer
team to visit the United States this June in an effort to improve
the relation between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Iran have had no diplomatic relations
since November 1979,but sporting competitions have been a part of
a fitful rapprochement between the countries. The U.S. national
wrestling team was warmly received for two competitions in Tehran
in April and September 1998.
</P>
<P>
Jim Dalrymple, RFK Stadium's general manager, said he has not
been asked about hosting the game, but "we would definitely be
open to the idea. I would think there would be a lot of interest
in that one."
</P>
<P>
Stenbrecher, who spoke at Alltel Stadium here while the U.S.
team played against Germany in a friendly soccer game, said the
USSF has been in contact with the State Department, the Iranian
government and Iran's soccer federation.
</P>
<P>
One complication is how the Iranians would be paid amid U.S.
government restrictions on conducting business with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iran beat the United States 2-1 in the World Cup last summer in
France.

<HEADLINE> Peruvian General Detained on Drug Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian Army General Staff Chief
Tomas Marky was detained by the authorities on charge of
appropriating assets worth of one million U.S. dollars that
belonged to an imprisoned drug trafficker, the Lima newspaper La
Republica reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that Marky surrendered last week to the
military high command and now is in a top security cell in the "
Santa Monica" prison of Lima.
</P>
<P>
The detention of the high-ranking military chief was ordered by
Lima's Second Court of Justice specializing in drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The daily said that Marky involved in the case of Army
Lieutenant Omar Zegarra, a defendant in the process, who told the
prosecutors that Marky appropriated one million dollars seized
from two Colombian drug traffickers, whom Zegarra detained in 1994
in Ayacucho.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls for Peace Between Eritrea and Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 6 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Saturday called on Eritrea and Ethiopia to stop
hostilities at once and smooth the way for political settlement of
territorial disputes between the two Northeast African countries.
</P>
<P>
A statement, issued here through Annan's spokesman, said,
"Regardless of who initiated the current fighting, he calls on
both parties to cease hostilities immediately so as to give a
diplomatic solution a chance."
</P>
<P>
"The alternative, continued fighting, is completely
unacceptable to the international community," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who has read reports of serious fighting between the two
countries, "is especially concerned that hostilities on this scale
should have broken out while international peace efforts,
including his own envoy Mohamed Sahnoun, were continuing," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"He is distressed that these two countries, which have so much
to gain from working together toward economic prosperity in the
Horn of Africa, should instead be locked in battle over their
border dispute," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Eritrean and Ethiopian troops clashed along their disputed
border on Saturday, with each side accusing the other of
instigating the latest round of fighting.
</P>
<P>
The flurry of claims and counter-claims came the same week that
U.N. Special Envoy Sahnoun held talks with leaders of both
countries to promote peace proposals drafted by the Organization
of African Unity and endorsed by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Both Eritrea and Ethiopia claim sovereignty over Badme, a rocky
triangle of sparsely populated land covering about 400 square
kilometers, which was occupied by Eritrea during the ground and
air war that exploded in May last year.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea fought a 30-year war against Ethiopia and was granted
independence in 1993, but the sections of their common border,
which runs some 998 kilometers in length, in fact a colonial
legacy, were never demarcated.
</P>
<P>
The two countries went to war in May last year and after a few
weeks of air raids and artillery attacks that left up to 1,000
people dead, the conflict settled into sporadic skirmishes.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. White House
intern Monica Lewinsky told her story in public on Saturday,
testifying in videotape snippets before President Bill Clinton's
impeachment trial at the Senate and a nationwide television
audience about a sexual affair and cover-up.
</P>
<P>
First, the House prosecutors, then the president's defense team
served up segments of her taped deposition to the Senate to
buttress the case for and against Clinton's conviction.
</P>
<P>
In portions aired at the behest of prosecutors, Lewinsky said
Clinton had never instructed her to tell the truth when word of
the affair began to leak, responding "correct" when asked if that
were the case. "I knew I would deny the relationship," she said.
</P>
<P>
But in tape shown by the Clinton defense team, she testified
Clinton did not suggest she use their cover story in an affidavit
she was to file in the Paula Jones lawsuit. In addition, she said
she never thought the affidavit was to be false. Had Clinton
suggested that, she said, "I would have remembered something like
that, and I don't."
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, is
charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in two articles of
impeachment in connection with his relationship with Lewinsky. The
two articles were approved by the House along partisan lines on
December 19 last year.
</P>
<P>
The Senate is expected to vote on the two articles of
impeachment against Clinton on February 12. A two-thirds vote is
needed to convict the president and remove him from office. No one
believes there are enough votes in the Senate to remove Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky's image, a young woman in a dark dress adorned by a
single, strand of pearls, lit up four large video monitors in the
Senate chamber. Viewers saw her flip her hair from her face
periodically.
</P>
<P>
There was no indication that her testimony had shaken the
prospects for Clinton's expected acquittal on the two articles of
impeachment by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
Some reactions to Saturday's session divided along party lines.
</P>
<P>
Republican Senator Larry Craig said the prosecutors'
presentation, which included videotaped testimony from Lewinsky,
presidential friend Vernon Jordan and White House aide Sidney
Blumenthal, was "devastating to the White House."
</P>
<P>
But, Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer said, "I don't think it's
a bombshell to see her, the face and the voice together."
</P>
<P>
The Senate, signaling its eagerness to wrap up the trial,
refused earlier this week to allow House prosecutors to call
Lewinsky for live testimony.
</P>
<P>
Instead, senators gave the prosecutors, then White House
lawyers, three hours each to present portions of videotape to
buttress their cases for and against Clinton's conviction.
</P>
<P>
Though Americans have said repeatedly in surveys that they want
the impeachment proceedings ended, many were expected to tune in
Saturday to get their first glimpse of Lewinsky speaking. The
trial was carried live by CNN, C-SPAN and CBS among others.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors also showed snippets from the testimony of two
other witnesses, presidential friend Vernon Jordan and White House
aide Sidney Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
The session is the last before closing arguments, scheduled for
next Monday, but the schedule could be affected at the last minute
if King Hussein of Jordan dies. A number of senators would be
expected to attend services for the respected monarch.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Pleads for Substantial Autonomy in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RAMBOUILLET, France, February 6 (Xinhua) -- French President
Jacques Chirac Saturday pleaded for "substantial autonomy" in the
Yugoslav province of Kosovo, where 90 percent of the population
are ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Chirac made the appeal when opening the peace talks on Kosovo
in Rambouillet, where the representatives of Yugoslavia and ethnic
Albanians Saturday began their closed-door negotiations under the
co-chairmanship of French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine and
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook.
</P>
<P>
"The framework of the talks has been clearly defined by the
Contact Group. The principles of a substantial autonomy will be
presented to you. It is up to you to make them precise and give
them the form so that inside the existing frontiers, all the
inhabitants of the province, whatever their origin, could live in
peace and the respect of their person and their right," said
Chirac.
</P>
<P>
While appealing to the belligerent sides of Kosovo to build
peace and turn toward a new horizon which is Europe, Chirac said
that Europe knows how to make peace between enemies, as it has
succeeded in removing the fracture which divided it during the
Cold War.
</P>
<P>
"By appealing to you to make this peace, I invite you to make
it yours the values of liberty, democracy and tolerance which make
up the foundation of the European Union. It is in this way that
you return to your place in the European family," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that the international community will no longer
tolerate the conflict in Kosovo, which he said mocked at the
essential principles of human dignity.
</P>
<P>
He urged the two conflicting sides in Kosovo to make a decisive
step toward reconciliation and be committed to a process which
leads to a substantial autonomy in Kosovo in the respect of the
rights of all.

powers of a Jordanian king.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference after an emergency cabinet meeting,
Information Minister Nasir Judeh announced that the cabinet
named Abdullah as the regent upon the will of the Royal family as
63-year-old king Hussein was unable to exercise his constitutional
power.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah has all royal powers, including the rights of
declaring war, ratifying international treaties, dissolving
parliament and appointing the government, Judeh said.
</P>
<P>
Granting all the administrative authority to Abdullah marked
his transition to the throne, closing the nearly half-century rule
of Hussein.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pledges Continued Support for Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
pledged continued support for Jordan Saturday as Jordanians are
praying in vain for the health of King Hussein, who is barely
alive on life-support systems in an Amman hospital.
</P>
<P>
In a written message to Jordan, Clinton said he would rush next
week to ask the U.S. Congress to ratify a 3-million-dollar
additional aid to the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
"In this time, my thoughts and prayers, as the thoughts and
prayers of all Americans, are with His Majesty King Hussein, his
family and the Jordanian people," Clinton said in an emotionally
worded statement.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, a close personal friend of Hussein, had also called
the Hussein Medical Center, where Hussein is hospitalized, to
inquire about health conditions of the 63-year-old monarch.
</P>
<P>
Hussein was flown back to Amman Friday in a critical condition
after an unsuccessful bone cell transplant as part of lymphatic
cancer treatments at a U.S. hospital.
</P>
<P>
His health deteriorated after his homecoming and he is currently
living on a respirator, though the government insisted that the
king's brains and heart are still in a normal condition.
</P>
<P>
Hussein's eldest son Abdullah Bin Hussein has assumed all
constitutional powers of a Jordanian king as Hussein was unable to
perform his royal duties.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa held talks Saturday with his Armenian counterpart Vardan
Oskanyan on international issues of common concern and ways of
promoting bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a joint press conference with Oskanian, Moussa
expressed the hope that Egypt and Armenia will coordinate their
efforts in promoting bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Terming the talks as "very useful," he said he briefed Oskanian
on the stalemate of the Middle East peace process, adding that he
is confident of Armenia's support for the Arab just cause.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between the Palestinians and Israel are stalled
due to Israel's failure to carry out the Wye peace agreement
signed last October.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel should withdraw its troops from
another 13 percent of the West Bank in three phases. Israel
suspended the implementation of the accord after conducting the
first phase of pullback in early December.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is "an important state" in the Middle East, Oskanian
said. He expressed hope that the bilateral economic cooperation
would rise to the level of the good political relations.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the peace process, Oskanian said his country
supports the efforts in solving problems through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the Palestinians' rights for self-determination
and called on the Palestinians and Israel to commit to the signed
peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
Oskanian arrived here Friday for a three-day visit.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: An Era Passes With King Hussein </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Crown Prince Abdullah
Bin Hussein Saturday assumed all constitutional duties of a
king, signalling an end to the nearly half-century rule of King
Hussein, the Mideast's longest reigning leader.
</P>
<P>
Thus Abdullah became the de facto head of state of the
Hashemite kingdom with full royal powers, including declaring
war, ratifying international accords, dissolving parliament and
appointing cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
Hussein has apparently lost his seven-month battle against
lymphatic cancer and sources close to the royal family said that
the king is now living on a respirator and his organs except the
heart have collapsed.
</P>
<P>
The cancer-stricken king was flown home upon his own wish
Friday from the Mayo Clinic, Minnesota, the United States, where
he Tuesday received a second but fatally unsuccessful bone marrow
transplant as part of the cancer treatments.
</P>
<P>
During his 46 years as king, Hussein had printed his personal
marks and characteristics on everything of the kingdom, its
politics, economy, military, diplomacy and even its lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
He left a vacancy on the Jordanian diplomacy in the stalled
Mideast peace process, where he had been a key and active player
for peace.
</P>
<P>
Hussein, 63, masterminded a dramatic shake-up of power two
weeks ago by removing his brother Hassan Bin Talal as the heir to
the throne after he had served as crown prince for 34 years.
</P>
<P>
He named his eldest son Abdullah Bin Hussein as the new crown
prince on January 26.
</P>
<P>
A smooth power transition is widely anticipated given the
strong background in the Jordanian military of the 37-year-old
Abdullah, Hussein's successor to the throne.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah, a largely unknown figure outside the Arab world, is
the eldest son of Hussein from his second marriage to British Tony
Gardiner, who adopted the name Mona Al-Hussein when she converted
to Islam upon her marriage to Hussein in 1960.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah, who had received education in Britain and the U.S.,
was promoted to the rank of an army general in 1998, and now he is
also in charge of the most elite special force of the kingdom that
supervises the security of the Royal family.
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly, the special force under the command of Abdullah
will serve as a stabilizing factor in the post-Hussein era in the
kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah has established close and friendly ties with young
princes and emirs of the ruling families in the gulf states, and
he is also popular with the predominantly Palestinian population
in Jordan because his wife Rania al-Abdullah is Palestinian from
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
All these factors may help him play a role in the Middle East
affairs, particularly in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah has promised to follow the suit of his father King
Hussein to pursue a policy of peace in the Mideast.
</P>
<P>
But he has a long way to go to walk out the shadow of King
Hussein, who had largely became a symbol of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Jordan became the second Arab country after Egypt to
sign a peace treaty with Israel, a move which later left a
positive impact on the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
In October 1998, Hussein and U.S. President Bill Clinton, as
witnesses, signed the land-for-peace Wye agreement between Israel
and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah's transition to the throne takes place at a time when
the peace process has been rendered in a deadlock over the
suspension of the implementation of the Wye peace deal.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to fill the vacancy of Jordan's diplomacy in the
peace process, but it takes time.

<HEADLINE> 1 Killed, 12 Wounded in S. Lebanon Conflicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 6 (Xinhua) -- A member of the Israeli allied
South Lebanon Army (SLA) was killed and 11 Lebanese civilians and
a SLA militiaman were wounded Saturday in separate incidents in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said that the militiaman died in an Israeli
hospital after he received a serious injury by a roadside bomb.
</P>
<P>
The bomb exploded when a militia group were driving down the
main road in the village of Houla in the central sector of the
Israeli occupied zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Two SLA members were wounded at the time and rushed to an
Israeli hospital, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has claimed
responsibility for the attack, which led to the death of the
first militiaman since the start of this year.
</P>
<P>
In response, SLA forces fired rounds of shells on four
villages on the fringe of the boder enclave, wounding a total of
11 Lebanese civilians in the Majdal Silm village in the central
sector of the zone.
</P>
<P>
They were taken to hospitals in nearby Tibnin village and the
country's southern port city of Sidon and Tyre for treatment.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli attack raised to 18 the number of Lebanese
civilians wounded in south Lebanon since the start of this
year. One civilian was killed during an Israeli air raid on the
country's eastern province of Bekaa last month.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Crackdown on Gun-Show Purchases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
requested legislation Saturday to require background checks on all
firearms buyers at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
In his weekly radio address, Clinton said the 1994 Brady law's
requirement for background checks -- meant to bar felons from
owning guns -- now should include gun-show sales by unlicensed
collectors and private hobbyists.
</P>
<P>
Such sellers make up one-quarter or more of gun-show vendors,
leaving the current exemption a loophole "wide enough that
criminals reach right through it, grabbing, collectively,
thousands of firearms that disappear without a trace," Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
His proposed legislation would also broaden the legal
definition of gun shows to include flea markets -- and any other
venue -- where two or more people are engaged in the sale of at
least 50 firearms.
</P>
<P>
According to the Gun Show Calendar, a periodical, 4,442 gun
shows were advertised around the country last year. The National
Association of Arms Shows says these weekend markets draw up to
5,000 people per show with admission fees starting at 5 U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Clinton called for the legislation after recommendations by the
Treasury and Justice departments, which jointly surveyed over 300
recent investigations involving 54,000 firearms linked somehow to
gun shows.
</P>
<P>
Almost half of the show-related investigations involved felons
buying or selling firearms, and in more than a third of the
investigations, the firearms in question were known to have been
used in subsequent crimes.
</P>
<P>
"It shows conclusively that gun shows are a forum for gun
traffickers, a cash-and-carry convenience store for weapons used
to maim and kill," Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Strategic Source of Oil: U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson said on Saturday that Saudi Arabia is of strategic
importance in meeting future U.S. needs of oil.
</P>
<P>
Richardson, who arrived in Riyadh Friday for a three-day
visit, stressed the great importance of the Gulf kingdom as a
secure and reliable source of oil for the U.S. and other
countries in the world, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Richardson made the remarks after meeting with Saudi Minister
of Petroleum and Mineral Resources Ali Bin Ibrahim al-Naimi on
future investments in Saudi Arabia's oil sector.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official also called on U.S. companies to invest in
energy projects in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, which has a reserve of about 260 billion barrels
of oil and nationalized its petroleum industry in 1980, has
invited U.S. and other foreign firms to invest in its petroleum
sector.
</P>
<P>
The invitation to U.S. firms was made by Saudi Crown Prince
and First Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz during
his visit to Washington last October, when he called on the
U.S. companies to take part in his country's plan to develop the
oil, gas and mineral industry.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia was making efforts to attract more investments to
develop gas production, which is vital for producing electricity
and operating plants in the future, especially after the constant
drop of oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Losses from the slump in the prices of oil and petrochemical
products were put at 12.26 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
U.S. firms have showed interests in investing in oil
exploration and extraction in the country, the section which is
excluded from open investments.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources in the region said the talks were expected to
end in reaching an appropriate framework for bilateral
cooperation and investment in the energy fields.

national force which is a microcosm of future Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The president praised the army's combat efficiency, especially
that of the technical units.
</P>
<P>
Museveni noted that the UPDF officers and men have an excellent
record of tenacity and are able to live in very difficult
conditions.
</P>
<P>
He called upon the UPDF authorities to work on improving
individual combat skills as well as skills to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
They should also value, look after and jealously guard all army
 resources, both financial and material, he asserted.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says U.S. Stands by Jordan, Pledges Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said on Saturday that the United States "stands by Jordan" and
pledged to provide economic assistance to the kingdom, which is
now reeling from the terminal illness of King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
"The United States stands by Jordan and is determined to do
all that it can to support and strengthen it," Clinton said in a
written statement.
</P>
<P>
The president said he would ask Congress next week to quickly
approve 300 million dollars in additional assistance over three
years that otherwise would be delayed until implementation of the
Wye peace agreement, signed in October by King Hussein, Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
This is in addition to 225 million dollars in annual assistance
the United States plans to send Jordan this year and next year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Clinton's promise for aid reflects the U.S.
concern that a weak economy may be the main threat facing King
Hussein's son, Crown Prince Abdullah in his first brush with
exercising power.
</P>
<P>
But administration officials denied they saw any imminent
threat to Jordanian security.
</P>
<P>
"There's no sense of emergency at all, but there is a feeling
on their part that the Jordanian economy is a real problems for
them," said a senior administration official.
</P>
<P>
Reports here said that the world Bank and the International
monetary Fund also are likely to provide heavy support for
Jordan.
