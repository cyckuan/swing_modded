<HEADLINE> NBA Legends Start China Tour with Victorious Note </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Clyde "The Glide" Drexler led
the NBA Legends to a 79-73 win over the Chinese national men's
basketball team Friday night here to open the NBA Legends Tour in
China.
</P>
<P>
The Tour, which will be annually held in the next two years,
features big names in NBA history like Drexler, Buck Williams and
Eddie Johnson. Friday's game attracted about 15,000 audiences in
the Beijing Workers' Stadium.
</P>
<P>
Even a group of 40 high-school cheer-leaders from Massachusetts
joined the over-40s Legends squad, performing for the first time
before the NBA-crazy fans in China.
</P>
<P>
"I've lots of fun here," said Drexler, one of the NBA 50
Greatest Players who retired from the Houston Rockets in 1998.
</P>
<P>
But for the Olympics-bounding Chinese national team, who won
the Asian championship in Fukuoka, Japan, last year, the loss is
not funny at all.
</P>
<P>
China, whose best placing at the Olympics was eighth in
Barcelona, 1992, were outclassed in fields like defense, strength
and experiences by the Legends team 20 years senior to them.
</P>
<P>
The Legends 10-player squad played a solid defense and fast
passing game, outran the much younger and taller Chinese, who will
face the United States in their first game at Sydney in September.
</P>
<P>
"They need to know how to play both the inside and outside game,
and they need to play better defense," said the Legends coach Rick
Barry. "If they want to get good results in the Olympics, they
also need to be stronger."
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old Drexler, who is household name in China, scored
four points on three fast breaks in the first half, and even tried
to make some spectacular plays before he was fouled.
</P>
<P>
On the other side, however, China managed only two points
inside the key with the 2.28-meter Yao Ming and 2.13-meter Wang
Zhizhi in the first 20 minutes when they led 44-37.
</P>
<P>
"Despite their ages, the NBA players are more experienced and
have all-round skills," said China's forward Sun Jun.
</P>
<P>
The NBA Legends will leave for Guangzhou on Saturday for Game 2
in Guangzhou Tianhe Stadium on Monday. Game 3 will be in Shanghai
on August 17.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinians are committed
to carrying on negotiations with Israel and supporting the peace
option, said Farouk al Kadoumy, director of the Political
Department of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In statements to reporters following his meeting with Syrian
Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh, Kadoumy said he kept Shareh posted
on the Palestinian-Israeli talks at Camp David, the United States,
which dealt with several sensitive issues including the status of
Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees and a Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, preparations by the Jerusalem Committee, a
subordinate organization of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference entrusted with protecting the Arab and Islamic
characters of Jerusalem, for a meeting on the fate of the holy city
before September 3 were also discussed, he added.
</P>
<P>
Kadoumy criticized Israel for not honoring its promises in
signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
Kadoumy arrived here on Friday evening from Beirut. He has left
Damascus for Amman on a state visit to Jordan.

BAGHDAD -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has chaired a rare

The meeting focused on the almost-daily aggressions by the
United States and British warplanes over the two no-fly zones they

triggered by Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, the official Iraqi

The meeting held Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, Iraq's two Arab foes

<HEADLINE> Turkey Condemns Bomb Attack In Moscow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, Aug 12 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer
on Saturday sent a message to Russian President Vladimir Putin,
condemning the bomb attack in Moscow on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued by the Presidential Press
Center, Sezer denounced the attack which killed and wounded more
than 100 innocent people.
</P>
<P>
During the terrorist attack in the Russian capital, the blast
tore through tunnels leading from a main underground railway
station, throwing the site into a bloodbath.
</P>
<P>
In his message, Sezer expressed sorrow over this attack, asking
Putin to convey his condolence for the people killed in the attack
and his wish that the injured should get a quick recovery.
</P>
<P>
The terrorist attack appeared to be similar to those bombings
which struck Moscow last year and killed nearly 300 people.
</P>
<P>
The blasts were one of the reasons why Russia last winter began
to launch large-scale military operations against rebels in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports, Chechen sources here have
categorically denied any responsibility for Tuesday's bomb attack
in Moscow.

<HEADLINE> Arabs Vow Never to Cede "One Inch" of Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid stressed on Saturday that the Arabs will never cede "
one inch" of Jerusalem, whatever pressures and challenges they
face.
</P>
<P>
The Arabs are determined to support the Palestinian people in
their struggles to recover the sovereignty of Jerusalem and make it
the capital of their future independent state, Abdel-Meguid told
the inaugural session of the 11th conference of the Arab Federation
for Libraries and Informatics.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem is the most difficult and sensitive issue in the
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied East Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war and
declared it as its "eternal and undivided capital," a claim not
recognized by the international community. The Palestinians want
Arab East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leadership exerted tremendous efforts to defend
the Arab and Islamic rights in Jerusalem during the recent summit
with Israel at Camp David of the United States, he said in the
speech read out on his behalf by his advisor Saoud Zubaidi.
</P>
<P>
The 15-day Camp David summit between Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak under the host of U.S.
President Bill Clinton ended on July 25 without reaching an
Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement, largely due to failure to find
a solution to the status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The pan-Arab forum will continue to support the efforts by
Arafat and the Palestinian people, who are backed by United Nations
Security Council resolutions maintaining that East Jerusalem is
part of the occupied Arab territories and should be returned,
Abdel-Meguid said.

<HEADLINE> Arab Librarians Meet in Cairo to Protest International Conference in Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Arab Federation for Libraries
and Informatics began on Saturday its 11th conference in Cairo, an
alternative event to protest against an international meeting of
librarians in the disputed Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The conference held at the Arab League headquarters ahead of
schedule is an Arab response to the international libraries meeting
to be held on August 13-18 in Jerusalem, Abdel Gelil el-Tamimi,
head of the Arab federation, said before the conference started. He
did not give the date initially set for the event.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the International Federation of Library
Associations and Institutions (IFLA) is a violation of the
international law and United Nations Security Council resolutions,
el-Tamimi added.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied Arab East Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast War and
later declared it its "eternal and undivided capital." The U.N.
Security Council resolution 242 calls on Israel to withdraw from
East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want as the capital of their
future state. The status of the holy city is under negotiations by
the Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Arab librarians have demanded IFLA to suspend the meeting until
the Palestinians and Israel find a settlement for Jerusalem and
said on August 1 that they will boycott the IFLA meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The IFLA has ignored the serious consequences and decided to go
ahead with the conference in Jerusalem, which cannot be justified
or accepted," el-Tamimi said.
</P>
<P>
Organizers said in a statement in Israel last Monday that about
1,800 people from 80 nations are to attend the Jerusalem event, the
first in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The 300 participants at the Cairo conference, which runs until
August 17, will discuss creating an Internet site for Arabic
writings, and ways to boost writing from the Islamic world for
publication on the Internet, el-Tamimi said.

<HEADLINE> Somalia's Parliament to Make Debut Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Artah, Djibouti, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Somalia's national
assembly is expected to convene in Artah, Djibouti on Sunday for
the first time with two-thirds of the 225-member parliament having
been nominated.
</P>
<P>
Somalia's national peace conference opened in early May under
the auspices of Djibouti President Ismael Omar Ghelleh, with an
aim to give a central government to the Horn of Africa country
which has been splintered by warlords since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Omar Aden Qaddi, chairman of the Draft Committee for the
conference, told a Xinhua reporter on Saturday that 162 members of
parliament chosen by many of Somalia's clans have already been
registered, including 25 seats allocated to women.
</P>
<P>
The first 162 registered members, which is just two-thirds of
the parliament, can form a quorum for the convening of a meeting
on Sunday in accordance with the constitution set for the forth-
coming government.
</P>
<P>
However, it is obvious that many of the clans especially those
that have been complaining about the quotas of parliament seats
they have been given are not sending in their members. Nonetheless,
the Draft Committee officials said that they might gather the 162
members for an unofficial meeting Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Abdullahi Mohamed Abdulle, one of the clan members opposing to
the way the seats have been distributed said that the meeting by
the 162 members is a political joke aimed at confusing the
international community.
</P>
<P>
He said that entire clans from the Hawiyeh, Darod and Rahanwein
are missing and in accordance with the tradition anything that is
announced at the absence or without the consent of these clans
will be meaningless before the Somalis and might as well undermine
the entire meeting.
</P>
<P>
Besides these difficulties, there are a lot of political
campaigns going on in the very small town of Artah, where some of
the Somali clans are busy choosing their members for the
forthcoming parliament, others thinking of other ways to manifest
their grievance and disappointment of how the seats of the
parliament have been distributed.
</P>
<P>
According to the technical committee, nine politicians have so
far announced to contest the president of Somalia's interim
government for the coming three years.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, despite financial constraints the government
of Djibouti tried to create a suitable environment for over 2,500
Somalis in Artab to take part in the formation of their government.

<HEADLINE> Australians, New Zealanders to help U.S. Fight Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seventy-nine crew bosses from Australia and New Zealand will
lead a battalion of U.S. Army engineers from Fort Hood, Texas.
Fire center spokeswoman Mary Apple said that for every military
battalion, 32 strike team leaders are needed. And all U.S. fire
managers, she explained, were already fighting the 60 major fires
in western states.
</P>
<P>
Firefighters from throughout the United and Canada have joined
efforts in the West. Military troops are on fire duty and even
retired fire managers have been asked to come back on the job, she
added.
</P>
<P>
Officials said about 20,000 firefighters have been struggling
to contain the fires, which so far this year have burned 4.4
million acres in more than 70,000 blazes, nearly twice as big an
area as normal.
</P>
<P>
The storms during the past few days have brought little rain,
but delivered 21,000 lightning strikes that caused more wildfires
in the U.S. West, according to weather instruments.
</P>
<P>
"Twenty-one thousand lightning strikes means we will have many
new fires to contend with today and tomorrow and on in the future,
" said Incident Commander Steve Frye.
</P>
<P>
Montana is among 10 Western states where 60 large wildfires are
burning out of control. The worst wildfires in 50 years also went
out of control in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada,
New Mexico, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. Large wildfires in
Oregon and Texas were classified as contained.
</P>
<P>
Despite Friday's drop in the total number of large fires in the
West -- down from 65 on Thursday -- the amount of land ablaze
increased, an indication of the massive work still ahead for
firefighters.
</P>
<P>
With wildfires still burning out of control across a dozen
Western states in what may be the worst fire season in a
generation, a fierce debate in timber politics has begun to rage
over who might be to blame.
</P>
<P>
Fire experts had warned for years that a buildup of combustible
material in Western forests had reached vast and dangerous
proportions. But federal agencies did not begin to address the
problem until a policy shift in 1995, and conservative critics --
including the Republican governor of Montana -- were arguing today
that, even afterward, the administration did not move fast enough.
</P>
<P>
"The Clinton administration didn't cause these fires," Gov.
Marc Racicot of Montana, said in an interview, "but their policies
have left the Forest Service under-funded and under-prepared for
this crisis.
</P>
<P>
I don't think it's a conspiracy, but it's a philosophy they
have that leads to explosive fires that destroy everything."
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the attack, echoed by representatives of the
timber industry, was a contention that the priority given to
environmental concerns within the administration had prevented
officials from confronting the fire threat as might have been most
appropriate, through emergency logging measures.
</P>
<P>
Administration officials and their allies were quick to rebut
the criticism, suggesting that the critics were speaking mostly
out of self-interest, and arguing that the United States Forest
Service and other agencies had acted responsibly.
</P>
<P>
"It's a campaign year, and these charges are politically
motivated," Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, said in a telephone
interview from Colorado.
</P>
<P>
Independent fire experts in the West have said that the blazes
appear to be following no particular pattern, burning with roughly
equal fury in areas that have been logged in the past and those
where development has been prohibited. But some said there were
indications that the recent use of fire-prevention measures had
given some areas an additional margin of protection.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi President Chairs Important Joint Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
has chaired a rare joint meeting of the Revolutionary Command
Council and the ruling Arab Baath Socialist Party.
</P>
<P>
The meeting focused on the almost-daily aggressions by the
United States and British warplanes over the two no-fly zones they
carved in southern and northern Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War,
triggered by Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, the official Iraqi

which host the Western allies' warplanes which patrol the southern
no-fly zone, responsible for the "perpetuation of the (U.N.)

</P>
<P>
Since the 1991 Gulf War, it has been rare for the Iraqi
president to hold such joint meetings of the Revolutionary Command
Council, the supreme power organ of the country, and the Iraqi
branch of the Arab Baath Socialist Party.
</P>
<P>
The tension between Iraq, on one side, and Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait , on the other, has been increasing following Saddam's
speech on August 8 on the occasion of the 12th anniversary of the
end of the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
In the speech, Saddam condemned the rulers of Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait as "traitors who sold their souls" for allowing the U.S. and
British planes to use their bases "to bomb and kill Iraqis."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iraqi media has launched an anti-Kuwait campaign,
during which a newspaper owned by Saddam's son said Iraq is still
capable of teaching Kuwait "an additional lesson."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia have reacted strongly. Kuwait said on
Wednesday that it will take all precautionary measures against the
latest threat made by Saddam "against Kuwaiti security and
sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait on August 2, 1990 and the invasion
triggered the 1991 Gulf War, in which the U.S.-led multinational
coalition drove the Iraqi occupation troops out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has ever since remained under stringent United Nations
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Kuwait has ordered part of its armed forces
to keep on alert, and the Kuwaiti foreign ministry has met with
ambassadors of the five permanent members of the United Nations
Security Council over the alleged Iraqi threats.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has denied that it made threats to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Since December 1998, the U.S. and British planes have been using
bases in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Turkey to bomb targets in the two
no-fly zones with the claimed aim of protecting the Kurds in the
north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from the forces of
President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has never recognized the air-exclusion zones and has termed
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait "full culprits" for their collaboration
with the U.S. and Britain.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Foreign Debts Drop by 4.4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's foreign debts declined to
6.9 billion U.S. dollars by the end of June, a 4.4-percent drop
from the record 7.2 billion dollars as of the end of 1999, the
finance ministry said in its monthly bulletin on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, the foreign debts, which are equal to some 95 percent
of the kingdom's projected gross domestic product (GDP) in 2000,
still remains a heavy burden on the national economy, Jordanian
officials and analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The finance ministry attributed the decline of debt to a
fledgling ability by the government to repay its foreign debts
while it borrowed less from international lenders during the first
six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Some countries also contributed to alleviating the debts of the
kingdom, and France alone pardoned some 14 million dollars of debts
and converted another 56 million dollars of debts into investments
into the kingdom during the first six months, the bulletin said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Japan is the biggest creditor country to Jordan with
some 1.9 billion dollars, or 20 percent of kingdom's total foreign
debts, followed by France with 670 million dollars, slightly less
than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Britain, Germany, the United States, the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund also ranked high on the list of
creditors to the kingdom.

said.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the U.S. and British air raids killed one Iraqi and
injured 20 others, the official Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The INA report said the bombings of the U.S. and British
warplanes in southern Iraq killed a 22-year-old man and four of the
20 injured were in serious conditions.
</P>
<P>
The air raids also destroyed two cars, a number of houses and
power stations, the INA said.
</P>
<P>
The INA did not say whether Iraqi forces opened fire at the
aggressing planes.

<P>
The U.S. and Britain have been enforcing the two no-fly zones in

CAIRO, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin
Khalifa al-Thani is scheduled to pay a visit to Egypt next
Wednesday, the official Middle East News Agency reported on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hamad is expected to hold talks with Egyptian President

<P>
BAGHDAD, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Two Iraqis were killed and 19
others injured when the U.S. and British warplanes bombed the
southern part of Iraq Saturday afternoon, a military spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the official Iraqi News Agency (INA),
the spokesman said that at the local time 15:25 (1125 GMT), 17
formations of U.S. and British planes made 38 armed sorties over
the southern provinces of Basra, Misan, Thi-Qar, Qadissiyah, Wasit,
Najaf and Muthana.
</P>
<P>
The enemy planes were challenged by the Iraqi air defense
artillery and were forced to flee back to their bases in Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The air strikes followed Friday's air raids which killed one and
injured 20 others.
</P>
<P>
Iraq says the bombings have killed 300 innocent people, injured
1,000 others and inflicted huge property damages.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain have been patrolling the two no-
fly zones in the north and south of Iraq to protect Kurds in the
north and Shiite Muslims in the south from what they call is the
persecution of the Iraqi government.
</P>
<P>
The zones have been the site of almost daily skirmishes since
the allies's air war on Iraq in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad does not recognize the zones, which were established
after the 1991 Gulf War but are not directly covered by a United
Nations resolution.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Pilots Warn U.S. Media Against "Defaming" Counterparts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Egyptian Pilots
Association Walid Murad warned U.S. media on Saturday against "
defaming" Egyptian pilots in the wake of last October's EgyptAir
crash, threatening to take legal action.
</P>
<P>
The threat followed media reports by U.S. newspapers on the
character of co-pilot Gameel el-Batouti after the release on Friday
of 1,665 pages of documents relating to the crash that killed 217
people off the U.S. Atlantic coast.
</P>
<P>
Murad said the association will hold an emergency meeting to
discuss taking action through U.S. courts "to stop these cheap
efforts by the U.S. media to distort the truth and defame the
reputation of Egyptian pilots," the official Middle News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned in particular the daily USA Today, which published
a report on Friday alleging that el-Batouti made a series of
sexually suggestive acts in public, some of them in the days before
the crash.
</P>
<P>
"The American media are trying hard to ignore the real causes
that brought down the plane by telling the kind of stories they are
used to from pornographic magazines," Murad was quoted as saying by
the news agency.
</P>
<P>
"Even if we concede the truth of the story carried by the USA
Today, what relation does it have with the incident?" Murad asked.
</P>
<P>
The pilots association chief said that security reports
monitoring the behavior of Egyptian pilots abroad revealed no "
deviant or suspicious behavior" on the part of el-Batouti.
</P>
<P>
U.S. media reports have speculated that el-Batouti committed a
suicide by deliberately bringing down the EgyptAir Boeing 767. The
Egyptians are infuriated by the speculations and strongly oppose
the allegations. They would rather believe that technical failure
of the plane had caused the tragedy.

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Calls for Peace in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba said on Saturday that there is the need for peace if
meaningful development is to take place in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, who is in Zomba for a three-day state visit to Malawi,
made these remarks at a banquet in honor of him by the Malawian
government.
</P>
<P>
He said Africa has been riddled with wars for a long time and
now is the time to move away from those wars of hate and division
as they brought no development but shame.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said Africa is just too poor to engage in wars and
cited the on-going conflicts in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC) and Angola as draining the few resource that the
continent has.
</P>
<P>
Africa already has a crisis of HIV/AIDS on its hands and a
crippling debt as well, hence there is the need to promote peace
in the continent, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba noted that Africa's economies have remained fragile and
access to markets in the developed world has become difficult
hence there is the need to channel more resources to developmental
matters.
</P>
<P>
He challenged all African leaders that they have a
responsibility to promote peace by engaging in dialog.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same function, Malawian President Bakili Muluzi
commended Chiluba for his tireless efforts in trying to broker
peace in some war-torn parts of Africa, especially in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the two presidents held talks on how to
improve bilateral relations and on the best way to solve conflicts
in Africa.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Defense Forces Commended for Saving Lives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean defense forces
Saturday was praised for the crucial role it played in saving
lives when the devastating cyclone Eline struck in some parts of
the country early this year.
</P>
<P>
In an address to mark the 20th anniversary of the Defense
Forces Day, Commander-in-chief and President Robert Mugabe said it
was important to observe the national day at a time when the
effects of the devastating cyclone Eline were fresh on the minds
of people in eight provinces.
</P>
<P>
"The nation and its defense forces must be commended for having
demonstrated such a unity of purpose, selfless assistance, single
mindedness and dedication during this agonizing period," Mugabe
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the members of the defense forces secured and provided
foodstuffs, medication and other essential services to the needy.
</P>
<P>
He added the national defense forces had amply demonstrated
that at all times they were responsible for ensuring and bringing
about peace and tranquillity as well as maintaining stability and
conducive environment in which economic and industrial development
can take place.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said Zimbabwe would, in league with other peace-loving
nations of the world and this region, continue to pursue permanent
peace and stability in order to eliminate the threat and scourge
of war and bloodshed.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Denies Suspending Fund Raising for Zimbabwe's Land Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Office of the U.N. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan Saturday denied the U.N. boss had suspended
plans to raise money for the Zimbabwe's land reform because
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe was insisting on an arbitrary
land acquisition policy.
</P>
<P>
Annan's information officer Ferhan Haq told the Zimbabwe News
Agency in a telephone interview from New York that the report by a
local weekly was incorrect and fraught with inaccuracies.
</P>
<P>
The report said the move came amidst growing international
isolation over the land issue and possible U.S. sanctions against
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. intends to pass the Zimbabwe Democracy Act which seeks
to instruct the U.S. executive directors of multinational lending
institutions to oppose credits to Zimbabwe. The Bill was passed
by the U.S. Senate in June and is now before two committees in the
House of Representatives, currently in recess.
</P>
<P>
"It is not true that the U.N. boss had suspended plans to raise
money for Zimbabwe because President Robert Mugabe was insisting
on an arbitrary land acquisition policy," said Haq.
</P>
<P>
He said contrary to those statements the U.N. remained
committed to assisting Zimbabwe in its quest for a solution to the
land reform.
</P>
<P>
"These efforts to land reform continue at a technical level
through the U.N. Development Program," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government wanted to seize 3,041 white-owned
farms to resettle millions of its landless people.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Faces Challenge by Hagelin in Reform Party Nomination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Former Republican Pat
Buchanan won presidential nomination of his own faction of the
Reform Party on Friday night, but he faced challenge from the
breakaway faction of the party.
</P>
<P>
Buchanan's name was put into nomination and he was declared the
winner on grounds that there was no opposition at the party's
convention.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, Buchanan named Ezola Foster, a black Los
Angeles teacher, as his running mate for the 2000 general
elections.
</P>
<P>
Buchanan, who quit the Republican Party 10 months ago, has been
getting between 1 percent and 4 percent of support in polls.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nuclear physicist John Hagelin also claimed
nomination of the Reform Party Friday, throwing resolution of a
bitter political split to federal elections officials and likely
to the courts.
</P>
<P>
Hagelin declared himself the party's nominee at another
convention and he is expected to announce his own running mate
soon.
</P>
<P>
The nominations culminated months of battles between Buchanan
and old-line Reform activists who reject his conservative views.
</P>
<P>
Buchanan and Hagelin are vying for 12.5 million dollars in
federal campaign funds for the nominee of the Reform Party, which
was founded by Texas Billionaire Ross Perot.

<HEADLINE> Central Asian Officials Consult on Fighting Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Officials from Kyrgyzstan,
Uzbekistan and Tajikistan met in the southern Kyrgyz city of
Batken on Saturday to coordinate actions against Islamic rebels.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was designed to work out joint measures to fend off
bandit formations from the so-called Islamic movement of
Uzbekistan that invaded the territories of the Central Asian
states from Afghanistan, the Interfax news agency reported, citing
the Kyrgyz presidential press service.
</P>
<P>
Intensive fighting between the Kyrgyz government troops and the
invaders continued in the second half of Saturday, the press
service said.
</P>
<P>
"The Kyrgyz armed forces are taking all necessary measures to
blockade and wipe out the bandit formations that invaded the
country's territory; in connection with this, reinforcement units
of the Kyrgyz government troops are being urgently transferred to
the combat area," the service said.
</P>
<P>
Four Kyrgyz government soldiers have been killed and three
wounded, one seriously, in battles with the rebels in the Batken
region, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas have also taken two Kyrgyz servicemen captive
and another two are missing, including the commander of a special
independent unit of the southern government force, Interfax said,
quoting military sources.
</P>
<P>
A spate of fighting has been raging in the past few days along
the southern belt of oil-rich Central Asia, the worst violence in
the region since last August, when several hundred well-armed men
entered Kyrgyzstan from Tajikistan and held four Japanese
geologists hostage for two months.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a group of 30 to 40 armed rebels from Tajikistan
clashed with government troops in south Kyrgyzstan, just hours
after Russian border guards repelled an attempt by up to 40
fighters to go north from Afghanistan into Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, neighboring Uzbekistan is fighting up to 100 rebels
in the south, near its frontier with war-torn Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Acupuncture Promising for Treating Cocaine Addiction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Yale researchers have
successfully used acupuncture to treat cocaine addiction, a
disorder for which there are few effective treatments.
</P>
<P>
Published in the August 14 issue of the Archives of Internal
Medicine, study results showed that participants who received
auricular acupuncture -- needles inserted into specific parts of
the outer ear -- were more likely to have cocaine-negative urine
screens over the course of the study compared to those in control
groups.
</P>
<P>
The study included 82 participants who were addicted to both
heroin and cocaine. They received methadone for their heroin
addiction, but they continued to use cocaine.
</P>
<P>
Participants were assigned to one of three groups: auricular
acupuncture, "control" acupuncture -- needles inserted into four
ear points that are not thought to have a treatment effect -- or a
relaxation group, in which patients viewed videotapes depicting
relaxing images such as nature scenes.
</P>
<P>
The participants had treatment for eight weeks. Urine samples
were taken three times a week to assess cocaine use. In addition
to the study treatments, participants also received individual and
group counseling.
</P>
<P>
Results showed that 54.8 percent of participants tested free of
cocaine during the last week of treatment, compared to 23.5 and 9.
1 percent in the two control groups. Those who completed
acupuncture treatment also had longer periods of sustained
abstinence compared to participants in the control group.
</P>
<P>
"While our positive findings are gratifying, further research is
needed to replicate the results and to better understand how to
combine acupuncture with existing treatments for addiction," said
Arthur Margolin, the study's leading investigator and research
scientist in psychiatry at Yale School of Medicine.

<P>
MOSCOW, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal forces have
launched special operations against rebel chiefs inside the
breakaway republic of Chechnya, wounding three of them, the
Interfax news agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The wounded are eminent rebel field commanders Arbi Barayev,
Akhmed Zakayev and Ruslan Gelayev, Interfax said, quoting Colonel
General Vyacheslav Tikhomiron, commander of the federal interior
troops in the area.
</P>
<P>
Rebels headed by the three resisted federal troops for three
days in the village of Gekhi, Tikhomiron said.
</P>
<P>
He said 85 people in the village were exposed for having links
with the militants and that 30 of them were killed in detention
when they put up armed resistance, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
"Appropriate work is under way with the rest," the commander
said.
</P>
<P>
Another special operation against "a well-known field commander
" continues in Chechnya, the general said. He refused to further
identify the targeted rebel leader.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Demands U.S. Radar Information on EgyptAir Flight Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian aviation officials have
demanded that the United States provide detailed radar information
on last October's EgyptAir Flight 990 crash to explain high-speed
radar images near the plane in its final moments.
</P>
<P>
A review of the 1,665 pages of documents about relevant
investigations revealed a letter from Egyptian Civil Aviation
Authority chief Abdel Fattah Kato, who complained the withholding
by the U.S. side of the radar information, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In the documents, which were made public on Friday in the U.S.
and presented on the website of the U.S. National Transportation
Safety Board (NTSB), Kato did not give credence to a theory that
the plane was downed by a missile, but stressed the need to
investigate fully what the Flight 990 crew might have seen.
</P>
<P>
The EgyptAir flight crashed into the Atlantic Ocean shortly
after taking off from the New York International Airport on October
31, 1999, on its way to Cairo, killing 217 people on board.
</P>
<P>
The probe into this tragedy has produced radar data showing
three high-speed returns in the area of, and along the path of, the
Flight 990. The data shows these returns crossing the plane's path
just before it began its dive, Kato wrote to U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) on June 18.
</P>
<P>
He said that air traffic controllers had cleared the Flight 990
to pass through military "Warning Areas 506 and 105A" just prior to
the accident.
</P>
<P>
It was difficult to understand why data concerning the
characteristics of radar used in connection with the U.S. civil
aviation was classified and why it was unavailable for the analysis
of apparent targets that were in the vicinity of the plane, he
wrote.
</P>
<P>
Kato added that it was apparent from the air traffic control
transcript that no FAA controller was actually watching the Flight
990 at the time of the accident and for several minutes after.
</P>
<P>
The continuing Egyptian concerns appeared to question why NTSB
staff had concluded that "there were no unresolved safety issues,"
as asserted Friday by NTSB chairman Jim Hall, who released the
documents at a news conference.

<HEADLINE> ITU Brings Telemedicine to Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The International
Telecommunication Union (ITU) has helped establish the first
Telemedicine Pilot Project between Uganda's University Teaching
Hospital of Mulago and the Mengo Hospital in downtown Kampala.
</P>
<P>
In his inauguration address in the Ugandan capital of Kampala
on Friday, Ugandan Health Minister Dr. F. Byaruhanga praised the
ITU for its cooperation in enabling his country to harness the
latest information technology for a tangible humanitarian cause
which could help save lives, according to an ITU press release.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan minister also urged greater coordination and
synergy among development partners and called upon Uganda's
national telemedicine steering committee to work out the
institutional framework in which all stakeholders can participate.
</P>
<P>
The Uganda project is the second in Africa involving the Geneva-
based ITU's Telecommunication Development Bureau (BDT) in
innovative public and private sector partnerships.
</P>
<P>
"The project aims at showing how telecommunication and
information technologies applications such as telemedicine can
help overcome some of the serious shortages in health care
services in developing countries," said Hamadoun Toure, director
of the ITU's Telecommunication Development Bureau (BDT).
</P>
<P>
"This is yet another very concrete example on how the ITU helps
countries keep apace with the revolutionary advances in
telecommunication and information technologies in a bid to close
the digital divide," he added.
</P>
<P>
The pilot project is part of a strategy to provide specialist
care in surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics, gynecology and internal
medicine in regional referral hospitals whose medical teams can
only afford one or two specialists.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 50 percent of all 800 doctors are in
Kampala while 60 percent of nurses are in rural areas. With a
very high maternal mortality rate ranging from 500 to 2,000 deaths
per 100,000 births and an infant mortality rate of 97 per 1,000,
the need to improve medical delivery and to optimize limited
medical resources is a matter of life.
</P>
<P>
The pilot project also is aimed at providing access to other
specialties currently unavailable such as psychiatrics,
anesthetics or ophthalmology. The project is expected to be
further expanded to cover other hospitals in both the capital
Kampala and regional hospitals and dispensaries located in rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
Along with the ISDN point-to-point data link between Mulago and
Mengo hospitals, a Health Management Information System will be
set up to enable medical personnel to share knowledge, experience
and information rapidly and efficiently.

<P>
SEOUL, August 12 (Xinhua) -- South Korea Saturday urged the
United States embassy in Seoul to cancel its travel warning for
American visitors.
</P>
<P>
The warning, released by the U.S. Embassy in South Korea on
July 21, advises American citizens in South Korea to stay alert
and keep a low profile and avoid large crowds when visiting
commercial districts.
</P>
<P>
"The embassy's announcement can provoke misunderstanding in
Korea-U.S. relations, so we are requesting the embassy to cancel
the advisory," said a spokesman for the South Korean Foreign
Affairs and Trade Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. embassy in downtown Seoul has reportedly installed 10
super-modern cameras in the middle of trees just outside its
compound for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Strong anti-U.S. sentiments appeared in South Korea after the
United States Forces Korea (USFK) recently acknowledged it had

<HEADLINE> Turkish Police Seizes 70 Kilograms of Heroin in Istanbul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Turkish anti-narcotics police
launched two operations in Kadroy and Bagciar districts of Istanbul
on Saturday and seized a total of 70 kilograms of heroin.
</P>
<P>
Three suspects were taken into custody while smuggling the
heroin, worth 750 billion Turkish liras (about 1.5 million U.S.
dollars), Turkey's Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Istanbul anti-narcotic police said that acting on a tip-off,
they had monitored for two weeks the suspects who tried to transfer
to European countries the heroin which they brought to Turkey from
Iran.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is a commercial and cultural bridge between Europe and
Asia because of its geographical position. Nearly 70 percent of
illicit drugs produced in the rest of the world is smuggled to
European countries via Turkey.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the forces captured 3,219 suspects in 1,458
operations and seized 2,850 kilograms of heroin, 22.6 tons of
hashish, 976 kilograms of base morphine, 56 kilograms of opium, 6
kilograms of cocaine, 5.5 tons of acid anhydride, 618,336 captogan
pills and 14,964 synthetic drugs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 1,583 kilograms of heroin, 50 kilograms of cocaine,
15.5 kilograms of opium and 8.3 tons of acid anhydride were
confiscated in joint operations with the U.S., German, British,
Romanian, Belgian, Russian, Dutch, Spanish, Italian and Greek anti-
narcotics units.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, a total of 6,121 suspects were captured in 2,587
separate incidents while anti-drug forces impounded 2,249 kilograms
of heroin, 5,458 kilograms of hashish, 288 kilograms of base
morphine, 13 kilograms of cocaine, 26.2 tons of acid anhydride and
1,749,305 captogan pills.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Turkish chief police authority said the anti-
narcotics police had launched "determined and successful" struggle
against illicit drug trafficking via the country.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
RABAT -- Moroccan auditing authorities expected the country's
slow economic growth of mere 0.9 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The authorities in a release on Saturday attributed the economic
stagnancy to the two-year-old drought which heavily hurt
agricultural production and raised foodstuff import.
</P>
<P>
This year, Morocco will import about 53 million tons of wheat
from foreign markets, the release said, adding 500 million U.S.
dollars were earmarked for wheat import for the Autumn period.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey's state-run iron and steel producer Erdemir has
secured 50 million dollars in 10-year loans from Japan to finance
the installation of a continuous galvanizing line.
</P>
<P>
The company signed the loan agreement on August 7 with the
Japanese Bank for International Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The galvanizing line will be installed by a Japanese Mitsui
Nippon Steel-led consortium. Erdemir will provide another 20
million dollars for the project.
</P>
<P>
The line will produce 250,000 tons of high-quality galvanized
sheets annually, said Erdemir in a statement Friday.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey's wheat crops in parts of the country's bread
baskets sustained damages from hot weather and pests.
</P>
<P>
But the country's total national output may not be greatly
affected, said Yavuz Koca, deputy general manager of the state
grain board TMO.
</P>
<P>
Koca said the extent of damage could not be known before the end
of August, when reports from regional TMO offices are expected to
be completed.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Gold demand in the United Arab Emirates in the
second quarter of this year recorded a 2-percent growth over the
same period last year, reaching 24.3 tons, according to World Gold
Council.
</P>
<P>
Gold demand in Saudi Arabia reached 55.5 tons in the period, 9
percent higher than the last corresponding period.
</P>
<P>
In Kuwait, demand slipped to 8.8 tons from 9.2 tons in the same
period last year. Demand in Oman fell to 3.8 tons, from four tons a
year earlier, while demand in Qatar rose to 2.7 tons and that in
Bahrain slipped to 2.5 tons.

<HEADLINE> Proposed 2001 Budget to Promote Employment, Philippine Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The government-proposed national
budget for 2001 is expected to create more job opportunities, with
25 billion pesos (about 550 million U.S. dollars) allocated for
various job-related programs, said a Philippine senior government
official.
</P>
<P>
Among the agencies covered by the job-generation funds are the
Departments of Labor and Employment (DOLE), Social Welfare and
Development (DSWD), and Trade and Industry (DTI), budget and
Management Secretary Benjamin Diokno said over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
"Some 25.2 billion pesos (about 550 million dollars) have been
provided in the proposed national budget for programs and projects
that promote employment," Diokno said.
</P>
<P>
The DOLE has a comprehensive employment plan, while the DSWD
has a self-employment assistance program, along with a
comprehensive and integrated delivery system of social services,
he said, adding that the DTI has its Small and Medium Enterprises
Comprehensive Program.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada submitted the proposed budget to the
Congress on July 24 after delivering his State-of-the-Nation
Address before a joint session of the Congress.
</P>
<P>
Diokno urged lawmakers to approve the proposed budget "as soon
as possible" to prevent delays in the implementation of key
development programs.
</P>
<P>
The Estrada administration indicated that it wants the proposed
budget approved before the end of this year so it can release
funds to line agencies on the first working day of 2001.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Protests Against Foreign Interference in Anwar Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has issued "strong
" protest notes to countries and organizations that have made
statements attacking Malaysia's judiciary in its handling of the
criminal cases against former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry has sent the protest notes to the United
States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the European Union in
response to their statements, Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar
told a news conference here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a political case ...the case against Anwar Ibrahim
is criminal in nature. Criticisms or allegations that Malaysia's
judiciary is biased and under the control of the executive cannot
be accepted. It is in fact utter nonsense. Our system of justice
is basically similar to that found in other countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We respect bilateral relationships but we cannot accept this
interference and strongly protests against this," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said it needs to be reiterated that the trial was conducted
in a fair and open manner and in full compliance with Malaysian
law and judicial procedures.
</P>
<P>
It was Anwar who had turned the trial into a political drama to
champion his own political cause and attack the government rather
than respond to the charges against him, Syed Hamid said.
</P>
<P>
The Kuala Lumpur High Court found Anwar guilty of sodomy and
sentenced him to nine years in jail.
</P>
<P>
The sentence will start once he finishes a six-year jail term
for corruption that began in April last year.

<HEADLINE> Congress Soon to Pass Bill Barring Indiscriminate Issuance of TROs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Congress is
expected to pass soon a proposed measure barring indiscriminate
issuance of temporary restraining orders (TROs) on government
projects, a big boost to government's efforts to rehabilitate
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Senate President Franklin Drilon said Saturday the measure
would penalize courts that recklessly issue TROs, a major
hindrance in the implementation of government development projects,
especially those in the strife-torn southern island of Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
"We crafted the law already, and the president may sign it
before this month ends. It penalizes the indiscriminate issuance
of TROs," he said on a radio-TV program.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada earlier asked the Congress to
accommodate his request to pass a measure stopping courts from
carelessly issuing TROs as part of his bid to seek special powers
to speed up the implementation of long-delayed development
projects in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
He said such TROs tend to delay government projects, including
those funded through foreign assistance, and sometimes prompt
foreign partners to pull out their investments or withhold funding
in priority projects.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Joins Wheat Exporters Club </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has enlisted its name
among wheat exporting nations after the conclusion of a deal for
the export of 500,000 tons of wheat to Afghanistan, The News
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The country has harvested a bumper wheat crop this year with a
surplus of one million tons and the government grabbed the
opportunity to export wheat to neighboring Afghanistan, the daily
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Under the contract terms finalized on Thursday, the importer
Fazal Rahim Company Limited will lift 50,000 tons of wheat a month
from godowns in eastern Pakistani province of Punjab. The company
will pay 9,000 Pakistani rupees (169.8 U.S. dollars) per ton.
</P>
<P>
For lifting the remainder of 500,000 tons left with the
Pakistani government, the Afghanistan-based company is continuing
negotiations, the report said.
</P>
<P>
As Pakistan has no infrastructure for bulk road transportation
and loading of indigenous wheat onto ships at ports, the export of
wheat through seas was out of question, an expert said. There was
no option but to dispose of the surplus grain in Afghanistan, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Agricultural Sector Assured of Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine agricultural
sector has obtained an assurance that it will get needed funding
from the House of Representatives to sustain growth and
development.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Manuel Villar assured the sector over the weekend
of needed funding for the continued implementation of the
Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act (AFMA) passed during
the previous Congress.
</P>
<P>
"The agricultural sector is vital to the country's growth and
development and we must pour in the needed funds to develop this
sector," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture accounts for over 20 percent of the country's Gross
Domestic Product.
</P>
<P>
The government has proposed an allocation of 16.34 billion
pesos (about 360 million U.S. dollars) for the AFMA's continued
implementation for the next year, up from the 14.16 billion pesos
(about 314 million dollars) for this year. The total proposed
budget of the Agriculture Department, including the proposed AFMA
allocation, is 22 billion pesos (about 488 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Villar emphasized the need to modernize the country's farming
methods to increase productivity and ensure the country's food
security.
</P>
<P>
"We must work to continue pushing the agricultural sector
forward," he said, pointing out that two-thirds of Filipinos
derive their income from agriculture, which also includes the
fisheries subsector.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Textile Entrepreneurs Oppose SAARC Cumulation Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Textile entrepreneurs Saturday
asked the Bangladeshi government to avoid SAARC (South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation) Cumulation Rules within the
capacity of government itself to protect the country's growing
textile sector.
</P>
<P>
"It's clear that those in favor of SAARC Cumulation Rules are
having short-term interests by sacrificing long-term benefits and
gains of the nation," Bangladesh Textile Mills Association (BTMA)
Chairman Salman F. Rahman told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
He said the rules could be easily avoided by restricting the
issuance of the certificate of origin, essential instrument for
enjoying Generalized System of Preference (GSP) facilities from
the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB).
</P>
<P>
SAARC Cumulation Rules, when coming in force fully, will allow
the local garment manufacturers to use fabrics imported from any
of the SAARC countries for exporting finished products to 15
European Union (EU) countries to receive the GSP facilities.
</P>
<P>
EU notified the SAARC Cumulating Rules in its gazette on July
26, which is expected to be effective from October this year after
necessary procedures, said officials of European Commission in
Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
India and Pakistan would reap huge benefits from the regional
cumulating of GSP facilities, Salman said, noting that SAARC
Cumulation Rules will allow Indian and Pakistani fabrics and yarn
to be exported to the EU on duty and quota free basis via
Bangladesh by utilizing Bangladesh's GSP facilities.
</P>
<P>
"SAARC Cumulation Rules will destroy the local textile sector,"
he alleged.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local garment manufacturers hailed the cumulation
rules by saying that the rules will help expand market for the
country's ready-made garments. Fresh employment opportunities will
be created and closed garment factories will be reopened with the
establishment of more new factories following market expansion due
to the rules, they added.

<HEADLINE> Five Taliban Commanders among 150 Killed: Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan opposition has
claimed that five commanders were among 150 Taliban fighters who
were killed in the recent fighting in the northern Takhar province.
</P>
<P>
An opposition statement reaching here Saturday said that some
40 Taliban were taken as prisoners while at least four tanks and
20 vehicles of the radical Islamic militia were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
There was no independent confirmation of the death of the five
Taliban commanders although the opposition gave their respective
names.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the opposition alliance lost 15 men
and 12 civilians were killed in Taliban aerial bombardment at
Taloqn, capital town of Takhar.
</P>
<P>
The 15-hour Taliban offensive, one of the most intense
operations this year, was launched on Taloqan on Thursday. Arab
and other foreign fighters and some 5,000 Taliban soldiers
participated in the operation, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It said that the enemy's casualties were high with over 150
dead and hundreds injured. "At least 80 of their mortal remains
are still in the area."
</P>
<P>
The Taliban troops have retreated back to Bangi, a Takhar town
bordering Kunduz province, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Controlling over 80 percent of the Afghan territory, the
Taliban have been fighting against the opposition forces in
northeastern areas for the rule over the whole country.

<P>
In the statement, the South Korean press delegation said they
had a luncheon with Kim Jong Il Saturday and that their visit to

PRAGUE, August 12 (Xinhua) -- High jumper Tomas Janku of the
Czech Republic has been wrote off the national Olympic after it
was found the bar was miss placed at the qualifying event,
according to press reports here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old Janku, the 1998 European indoor bronze medalist,
was selected for Sydney after apparently clearing their minimum
qualifying height of 2.30m at a meet in Bilina on July 27.
</P>
<P>
But the Czech Athletics Federation went back on their decision
after being shown film of his jump and evidence from video experts
that the bar could only have been placed at 2.20m or 2.21.
</P>
<P>
Janku claimed he had jumped in good faith and that the meet
referees were responsible for the error. "I was convinced I had
jumped 2.30," he told the newspaper Sport.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the Federation had launched a disciplinary
inquiry to determine the exact circumstances of the matter.
</P>
<P>
In Atlanta four years ago, Janku, whose personal best is 2.32m,
finished 14th with a jump of 2.25m.

<P>
KUNMING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- A human genetic research center
has been set up in Yunnan University in Yunnan Province of
southwest China, where the Yuanmou Man, the earliest mankind found
so far in Asia, was discovered.
</P>
<P>
The center's head said it will try to make breakthroughs in
studies of human origin, variance of relations between ethnic
groups, and genetic diseases.
</P>
<P>
Boasting the richest botanic and animal resources in the
country, Yunnan also enjoys the largest number of ethnic groups in
China.
</P>
<P>
Rich genetic resources are well preserved in the province for
it is relatively occluded geographically and so it is reputed as
the "Land of Human Genetic Resources".
</P>
<P>
The South Center of the National Human Genes Program has
decided that the center will take charge of one research program
of the year. Shanghai's Fudan University, taking a lead in genetic
studies, has signed a cooperative agreement with the center to
jointly establish a research lab on human group genetics,
according to the head.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- A five-member Turkish
Parliamentary Delegation left on Saturday for Tripoli to seek
closer ties between Turkey and Libya.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, which is composed of members from the Turkish-
Libyan Parliamentary Friendship Group, was invited by Zinati
Mohammed Al Zinati, Secretary General of the Libyan General
People's Congress, said Gonul Saray Alpan, head of the delegation,
at the Istanbul's Ataturk Airport before departure.
</P>
<P>
During their five-day visit, Alpan said that they will meet with
senior Libyan legislative and administrative officials.
</P>
<P>
He said that both Turkey and Libya are eager to improve their
political and economic ties.
</P>
<P>
Since the United Nations suspended its sanctions on Libya as of
April 5, 1999, Turkey has made efforts to increase contacts with
Libya on further economic cooperation, which is characterized by
services given by the Turkish contractors in Libya and exports of
crude oil from Libya to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Turkey and Libya became tense as the Libyan
authorities felt uneasy about the increasing military ties between
Turkey and Israel years before.
</P>
<P>
Following a mutual exchange of harsh statements, Turkey withdrew
its Ambassador to Libya on June 13, 1997 to show its displeasure
and a new ambassador was appointed a year later.
</P>
<P>
There are nearly 2,500-3,000 Turkish citizens residing in Libyan
cities of Surt, Benghazi, Tripoli and Kufrah.

<HEADLINE> Putin Urges Speedy Capture of Blast Perpetuators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin
on Saturday ordered the country's law enforcement authorities to
raise their efficiency in capturing the perpetuators of the
Tuesday blast that killed 11 people Tuesday in central Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Putin urged the authorities to speed up their investigation at
a meeting with Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov, Defense Minister
Igor Sergeyev, Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo, Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov, Security Council Secretary Sergei Ivanov and
Federal Security Service (FSB) Director Nikolai Patrushev, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The rush hour blast, which rocked an underpass near
Pushkinskaya Ploshchad, a public square not far away from the
Kremlin, killed seven people on the scene and wounded over 100
others. Four of the wounded died later in hospital.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for the rush-hour attack,
the most powerful to hit the Russian capital so far this year,
although some officials immediately pointed their fingers at
separatists of the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a series of explosions across Russia killed more
than 300 people and injured numerous others. Authorities believe
Chechen militants were behind the blasts.
</P>
<P>
At the Saturday session, FSB Director Patrushev briefed Putin
on the evidence obtained and the investigation's prospects.
Interior Minister Rushailo informed the president on the police
and interior forces' steps within the framework of the fifth phase
of the Vikhr-Anti-Terror operation launched after the explosion.
</P>
<P>
Rushailo said that 62,500 patrols totaling 310,000 people have
been involved in law enforcement actions throughout the country in
the past 24 hours, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Some 27,000 members of public groups are also involved in
maintaining order, Rushailo said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 4,100 patrol dogs and 620 specially trained
hounds from different groups and private security structures are
employed in the search for explosives and illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
All together, over 1 ton of explosives and 48 explosive
devices have been seized across the country in the past 24 hours,
Rushailo said.

BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Sino-Pakistani relationship will
become even closer in the 21st century, and constitute a strong
factor of peace and stability in the region and the world as well,
according to Riaz Khokhar, Pakistani Ambassador to China.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan is proud of and satisfied with such an exemplary
relationship with China over a half century, and it is my firm
conviction that our relationship is a forward-looking one, and
would only be further strengthened in the years to come,"
Khokhar said today in a written interview with Xinhua on the eve
of Pakistan's Independence Day, which falls on August 14.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Pakistani relations are "time-tested and all-weather", he

essentially because it is based on the Five Principles of Peaceful
Co-existence and is not targeted against any country."

<HEADLINE> No Arrangements for Palestinian-Israeli Summit: Palestinian Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official has
denied any arrangements are being made for another summit between
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's advisor Nabil Abu Rdina told reporters Saturday that "
we are waiting for the outcome of the U.S. efforts aimed at
launching a new round of negotiations."
</P>
<P>
Abu Rdina said the final solution should be fair and just,
pointing out that the Palestinians reject any delay over the final
status issues.
</P>
<P>
The fate of holy city Jerusalem, the return of Palestinian
refugees, borders and security are the core issues in the final
status talks that collapsed without any breakthrough on July 25 at
Camp David of the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian official stated that the Jerusalem issue
represents a Palestinian, Arab, Islamic and Christian red-line
since the Holy City is a symbol for peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Both Israel and the Palestinians want the holy city as their
capital and differences over the status of Jerusalem was the major
cause for the breakdown of the Camp David summit.
</P>
<P>
He said the next few days will witness intensive Palestinian
political moves at all levels to coordinate efforts with the Arab
countries, Europe and the U.S. for pushing forward the peace
process in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said Arafat has visited 17 Arab, African and European
countries to explain and rally support for the Palestinian stance
after the Camp David talks.
</P>
<P>
Abu Rdina said Arafat agreed with Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami to take moves within the framework of the Organization of
the Islamic Conference to protect Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arafat returned to Gaza Saturday, punctuating his recent tour,
and is expected to preside over the weekly meeting of the PNA
Saturday night in Ramallah to discuss the political situation and
the results of his visits.

ANKARA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Turkish newspapers on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet:
</P>
<P>

province of Izmir, Turkish police uncovered on Friday another
fictitious exports worth 80 million U.S. dollars in western Bursa
province.
</P>
<P>
Seven suspects, including two famous businessmen, were taken
into custody in the operation.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet:
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer said on Friday that
there is no crisis caused by his veto of a governmental decree
which aims to fire civil servants involved in fundamentalist and
separatist activities.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit will submit the decree once more on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Devlet Bahceli, deputy prime minister and leader of the
Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) said that a real crisis will erupt
if Sezer vetoes the decree for the second time.
</P>
<P>
Yenibinyil:
</P>
<P>
-- Ahmet Ercan, chairman of Geophysic Engineers' Chamber in
Turkey, claimed on Friday that 45,000 people died in the massive
earthquake that hit Turkey on August 17, 1999 rather than 20,000
people as officially declared.

<HEADLINE> Statehood Declaration Date Discussed: Palestinian Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gaza, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Minister of State for
Non-governmental Organization Hassan Asfour said Palestinian
statehood timing is being discussed by the Palestinian leadership.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Doha-based "Aljezerah" TV channel, Asfour
said the Palestinian leadership is discussing whether an
independent state will be declared on september 13 as scheduled and
approved by the Palestine Central Council (PCC), and whether it is
possible to give a new opportunity for the negotiations with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said if progress were made in the peace process, the PCC
would tackle the statehood declaration issue in light of the
current situation and in its capacity as the sole decision-maker in
this respect.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chairman of the Palestinian National Council(PNC)
Salem Zanoun told the Voice of Palestine radio that the meeting of
the PCC scheduled for early next month will be "decisive",
especially on the date of statehood declaration.
</P>
<P>
He said postponing statehood declaration, taking into
consideration some friendly countries's advice with a view to give
the peace process another chance, requires a two-thirds approval in
the 129-member PCC.
</P>
<P>
Zanoun said Palestinian leadership' weekly meeting in Ramallah
Saturday night will discuss statehood-declaration-related reports
presented by the Palestinian Liberation Organization's committees.
</P>
<P>
The PCC announced earlier in July that a Palestinian state, with
Jerusalem as its capital, will be declared on september 13 with or
without a peace agreement with Israel over final status issues,
such as the status of Jerusalem, the return of the Palestinian
refugees, borders and security.
</P>
<P>
But negotiations have reached a deadlock after the collapse last
month of the Camp David summit that was convened to try to achieve
a breakthrough over major final status issues for a final and
comprehensive Palestinian-Israeli peace.
</P>
<P>
Israel, the U.S. and some major European countries, such as
Russia, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands, have opposed the
proposed unilateral declaration of the Palestinian state, for fear
of complicating the already intricate situation in the region.

<HEADLINE> Four-Million-Year-Old Fossils Found in Chongqing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Fossils of mammals four
million years old have been found in this southwest China
metropolis, including a stegodon tooth, a rhinoceros horn, and
bear and wild ox bones.
</P>
<P>
The fossils were accidentally discovered during civil
engineering work.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Shiwu, an expert at the Chongqing Museum, said that the
fossils belong to the Quaternary Period of the Cenozoic Era. At
that time, the climate was humid and warm in the area where
Chongqing now stands.
</P>
<P>
A drastic change in the climate resulted in prehistoric animals
like the stegodon becoming extinct, he said.
</P>
<P>
The fossils are useful data for the study of the climate,
environment and geological conditions of the Chongqing area in
those times, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, work has been suspended at the site of origin of the
fossils.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou to Build Rubbish-Burning Power Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 12 (Xinhua) -- This capital of south China's
Guangdong Province is planning to build a rubbish-burning power
plant to help tackle the problem of rubbish in the city.
</P>
<P>
The total investment in the plant will amount to 700 million
yuan, and the designed daily power output will be 450,000 kwh.
</P>
<P>
Occupying 90,000 sq m, the plant will handle 900 tons of
rubbish a day, accounting for 20 percent of the total rubbish
collected daily in the city.
</P>
<P>
Guo Shubo, head of the preparation work for the plant, said
that the environmental protection index of rubbish burned in the
plant will reach the standard set by the European Union.
</P>
<P>
According to Guo, the construction of the plant will be done by
a German company, while the operator of the plant will be a French
company.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Guangzhou's rubbish has been increasing
alarmingly. In 1990, the daily amount was 2,100 tons, but it rose
to 4,500 tons in 1999, and is expected to reach 6,500 tons in 2005.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Guangzhou plans to build another rubbish-burning
power plant, with a daily burning capacity of 2,000 tons.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Four Kyrgyz government soldiers
have been killed and three wounded, one gravely, in battles with
invading units of the Islamic movement of Uzbekistan in the
southern Batken region of the Central Asian republic.
</P>
<P>
Two Kyrgyz servicemen have also been taken captive by the
guerrillas and another two are missing, including the commander of
a special independent unit of the southern government force, the
Interfax news agency reported here Saturday, quoting military
sources.
</P>
<P>
Armed clashes between the Islamic guerrillas and the Kyrgyz
government troops are continuing in the Lyalyak district of Batken
region.
</P>
<P>
The exact number of guerrillas who have entered Batken region
is unknown, said the report.
</P>
<P>
A spate of fighting has been raging in the past few days along
the southern belt of oil-rich Central Asia, the worst violence in
the region since last August, when several hundred well-armed men
entered Kyrgyzstan from Tajikistan and held four Japanese
geologists hostage for two months.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a group of 30 to 40 armed rebels from Tajikistan
clashed with government troops in south Kyrgyzstan, just hours
after Russian border guards repelled an attempt by up to 40
fighters to cross north from Afghanistan into Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, neighboring Uzbekistan is fighting up to 100 rebels
in the south, near its frontier with war-torn Afghanistan.

MOSCOW, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The toll in Tuesday's blast in
central Moscow has risen to 11 after one more victim suffering
injuries and burns died Saturday, Russian media reported.
</P>
<P>
Seven people were killed at the scene of the explosion, which
rocked an underpass near Pushkinskaya Ploshchad, a public square

<P>
The eighth victim died in hospital Thursday and another two

officials immediately pointed their fingers at separatists of the
breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a series of explosions across Russia killed more

Chechen militants were behind the blasts.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Blast Death Toll Rises to 10 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The toll in Tuesday's blast in
central Moscow has risen to 10 after another two victims suffering
injuries and burns died Friday night, Russian media reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Seven people were killed at the scene of the explosion, which
rocked an underpass near Pushkinskaya Ploshchad, a public square
not far away from the Kremlin. More than 100 others were injured
and around 50 of them are being treated in several local hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The eighth victim died in hospital Thursday.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for the attack, the most
powerful to hit the Russian capital this year, although some
officials immediately pointed their fingers at separatists of the
breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a series of explosions across Russia killed more
than 300 people and injured numerous others. Authorities believe
Chechen militants were behind the blasts.
</P>
<P>
First Deputy Prosecutor General Yuri Biryukov said Wednesday
that no suspect has been detained for the Pushkin Square blast,
the Interfax news agency reported earlier.
</P>
<P>
Some suspects might be detained for various checks in the
course of search operations, but there are no detainees on this
particular case, Biryukov said.
</P>
<P>
Three major avenues are being pursued at the moment: a
terrorist act, hostilities between criminal groupings over the
division of trading territories in the Pushkin Square underpass
and a domestic crime resulting from personal enmity, revenge or
jealousy, the prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement bodies beefed up security across the country in
the aftermath of the Tuesday blast.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, an anti-terrorist operation started Tuesday evening
and all vehicles coming to Moscow are being thoroughly examined by
reinforced traffic police checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
In downtown Moscow, traffic appeared to be much lighter than
usual after the stepped-up security checks.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Oboidikhin, a spokesman for the Municipal Interior
Ministry, urged Muscovites to set up vigilante posts in apartment
building stairwells and to organize patrols of their buildings and
yards.

CANBERRA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Sydney 2000 Olympic medals,
coveted by more than 10,000 athletes around the world, made their
long-awaited public debut Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Designed by Australian sculptor Wojciech Pietranik, the gold,
silver and bronze medals incorporate traditional Olympic emblems
with famous symbols of Sydney.
</P>
<P>
The Opera House features on the reverse side of the medals
along with a depiction of the Sydney 2000 Olympic torch. Both
Australian icons are linked by fluid waves representing the water
of Sydney Harbour and the ocean.
</P>
<P>
The final icon on the reverse is the five Olympic rings,
overlaid in the centre of the design.
</P>
<P>
On the front is Nike, the Goddess of Victory, holding a laurel
wreath over her head, while cradling a bundle of palm fronds in
her arms, seated next to a grecian urn.
</P>
<P>
Below Nike are sprigs of wattle, the Australian national flower.
</P>
<P>
The medals, made by The Royal Australian Mint in Canberra and
the Perth Mint in Western Australia, are 68 milimetres in diameter
with a thickness ranging from three milimetres at the rim to five
milimetres at the highest relief.
</P>
<P>
Each gold medal is plated with a minimum of six grams pure gold
on a base of pure silver while the silver medal is pure silver.
The bronze is made from old one and two cent coins, now out of
circulation.
</P>
<P>
Each medal has a ribbon which is cyan blue in colour and
features a fluid energy watermark design.
</P>
<P>
Olympic organisers said that although 1,000 gold, 1,000 silver
and 1,100 bronze medals would be produced, it was anticipated
about 650 each of gold and silver, and 670 bronze medals would be
awarded during the games.
</P>
<P>
The extra bronze are needed for Judo and Boxing, where third
place has two official winners. The others are for tie scenarios
and spares.

<HEADLINE> China's Longest River Maintains Low Water Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Water level in the Yangtze River,
China's longest, has remained unusually low although this year's
flood season started in July.
</P>
<P>
Experts said this is because the river valley has had less
rainfall this year than in normal years.
</P>
<P>
In July, the water flow at Yichang city in the middle reaches
of the river, was about 17 percent less than in the same period of
normal years, according to the Yichang Hydrometric Station. And it
has declined even further in August.
</P>
<P>
The water level at Shashi hydrometric station, downstream of
Yichang, stood at 38.52 meters on August 10, 1.65 meters lower
than the average for August in past years, while the level
monitored at the Hankou hydrometric station in Wuhan was 22.12
meters, 1.82 meters below the precious figure.
</P>
<P>
Two flood crests formed on July 3 and 18, but water levels in
most sections of the river remained beneath the danger mark.
</P>
<P>
Although the low water level has exempted local people from
arduous flood-control efforts, it has caused shipping problems on
the river.
</P>
<P>
Dredgers had to be dispatched to deepen the waterways in Shashi
to prevent ships from getting stranded at the end of July and the
beginning of this month.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bangladesh Bank Governor Defends Taka Devaluation  by Pan Xiaozhu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh Bank Governor
Farashuddin Friday defended the central bank's decision to
depreciate the local currency against the U.S. dollar, saying it
was necessary to take such a step for the country to remain
competitive in the world market.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar here organized by the Bangladesh Economic
Association, the governor said devaluation of the taka by about 6
percent against the dollar did not come in an abrupt and haphazard
manner, rather, it was part of mid-term and long-term policies.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh Bank in an announcement on Thursday said the buying
rate of the dollar is re-fixed at 53.85 taka and the selling rate
at 54.15 taka. The new rate comes into effect on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's devaluation of the taka against the dollar was the
biggest ever since 1975. The bank last devalued the local currency
on November 30 last year when the buying rate of the dollar was
fixed at 50.85 taka and the selling rate at 51.15 taka.
</P>
<P>
Farashuddin said the neighboring countries and other
competitors of Bangladesh in the international market depreciated
their currencies widely, making it imperative for Bangladesh to go
for taka devaluation. However, the rate of devaluation in
Bangladesh was still low compared with those countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that in the last four and half years, India has
devalued its currency by 23 percent, South Korea 31 percent,
Pakistan 36 percent, Indonesia 73 percent and Thailand 89 percent.
Bangladesh went for only a 24-percent devaluation of the taka
against the dollar so far, he added.
</P>
<P>
Former Finance Minister Saifur Rahman said Friday however that
devaluation of the taka will discourage foreign investment, impose
a burden on the consumer and hinder cost-effective production of
goods.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his views to reporters here on the devaluation of
the taka,Rahman said currency stability is a precondition for
foreign investment inflows. Foreign investors naturally feel shy
in a situation where the currency fluctuates frequently, he added.
</P>
<P>
The former minister noted that devaluation is the reflection of
inefficiency prevailing in the economy and it never contributes to
a permanent solution in the process of overcoming the inefficiency
of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the seminar, eminent economist Prof. Rehman Sobhan
pointed out that Bangladesh unofficially imports goods and
services worth 2.5 billion to 3 billion dollars from India
annually. This huge underground trading is increasing the demand
for the dollar in the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
The country needs a proper tariff regime and proper valuation
policy for the taka, Sobhan observed, saying that unless
Bangladesh has a proper policy for the valuation of the taka, it
will not be able to encourage export diversification.
</P>
<P>
Experts here held the view that the wide differences between
the official rates and the curb market rate of the dollar since
the beginning of the current fiscal year have paved the way for
the official readjustment of the value of the taka.
</P>
<P>
The dollar has been selling between 56 and 56.8 taka in the
curb market during the last several weeks. The central bank
imposed several restrictions on dollar transactions but the
situation did not see any improvement.
</P>
<P>
It reflected a total mismanagement of the affairs of foreign
currency handling, experts said, adding that the authority found
no other alternative than to readjust the value of the taka
against the dollar and bring the official rates much closer to the
curb market rates.

<HEADLINE> McDyess Replaces Injured Duncan on Olympic Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Olympic basketball
team got Antonio McDyess of the Denver Nuggets to replace injured
Tim Duncan of the San Antonio Spurs on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Rod Thorn, chairman of the USA Basketball Men's Senior
National Team Committee, said McDyess brings to the team
versatility and enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
"He is a terrific shot-blocker and that is one of those things
we don't have enough of on this team," Thorn was quoted as saying.
"He brings the whole package: he shoots it, he plays inside, he
blocks shots, he's a defender."
</P>
<P>
Making the Olympic team has long been a goal for McDyess, who
was disappointed he did not make the original roster.
</P>
<P>
"Ever since I saw the first Dream Team, I've wanted to play on
it," McDyess said. "It was like a dream come true. ... It's an
accomplishment that seemed like I never would have made."
</P>
<P>
McDyess has averaged 17.1 points and 8.1 rebounds per game
since being selected by the Los Angeles Clippers as the second
overall pick in the 1995 NBA draft. He was traded to the Nuggets
that year and went on to become a third-team all-NBA selection
last season.
</P>
<P>
McDyess was traded to Phoenix for the 1997-98 season and
returned to Denver in 1999 as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
He joins Shareef Abdur-Rahim of Vancouver, Ray Allen of
Milwaukee, Vin Baker of Seattle, Vince Carter of Toronto, Kevin
Garnett of Minnesota, Tim Hardaway of Miami, Allan Houston of New
York, Jason Kidd of Phoenix, Alonzo Mourning of Miami, Gary Payton
of Seattle and Steve Smith of Portland.

<HEADLINE> S.Lankan President Vows to Push Through New Draft Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President has vowed
to push through the proposed new draft constitution despite this
week's failure to obtain a two-thirds majority in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
In an interview on Friday evening with Rupavahini, the state
television, President Kumaratunga said she was prepared to enact
the new constitution before the dissolution of the parliament on
August 24 if the main opposition United National Party (UNP)
agrees to support.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise she will enact the draft constitution within two
months after winning the next parliamentary elections which must
be held by early November.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been plagued by a 17-year war between government
troops and Tamil Tiger rebels who are resorting to terrorist bomb
attacks and assassinations in their campaign for a separate state
in the country's north and east.
</P>
<P>
The government of ruling People's Alliance has drafted a new
constitution in a bid to end the long-running civil war by
devolving more powers to regional councils including one
administered by minority Tamils. However, the debate on the draft
constitution was indefinitely postponed early this week as the
government could not muster the required two-thirds majority in
the parliament without the support of the UNP and other parties.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga said the government was mulling over the
alternative method such as the new constitution will be approved
in the parliament with a simple majority and thereafter be
implemented with the approval of the people through a referendum.
</P>
<P>
President Kumaratunga said the government has received advice
from internationally constitutional experts in this regard. As
such the parliament will be converted into a constituent assembly
for a short period after the next general elections and the
constitution thereafter approved following discussions.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga said her government was forced to temporarily
suspend the debate on the draft constitution following indications
that the required two-thirds majority was not forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
However, she reiterated that the failure to secure the required
number of votes has been a temporary setback.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that the government has not abandoned
the ongoing efforts to enact the proposed constitution and
rejected reports, claims and speculation that the protests against
the draft will force her to withdraw the bill.

<HEADLINE> Davis Sets American Record, Krayzelburg Wins Speciality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Josh Davis swam to an
American record en route to winning his 200m freestyle at the U.S.
Olympic swimming trials in Indianapolis Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
Davis, 27, clocked in 1:47.26, securing his outing to the 2000
Olympic Games slated for September 15 to October 1, while Scott
Goldblatt also qualified as he timed in second in 1:48.12.
</P>
<P>
However, the American are still far away to beat the world
record of 1:45.51 set by Australian Jan Thorpe in the Australian
trails in May.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Ukraine-born Lenny Krayzelburg was
closing to his own world record by clocking in 53.84 seconds, a 0.
20 seconds shy of his mark in the men's 100m backstroke.
</P>
<P>
His supremacy remained intact in the past years as his American
peers only managed a second-fastest time of 54.85 seconds by Neil
Walker in the trials tonight.
</P>
<P>
The women's 100m breaststroke finals produced another teenager
winner as 16-year-old Megan Quann finished first in 1:07.26. She
is expected to challenge South African Penny Heyns in Sydney, a
world record holder of 1:06.52.
</P>
<P>
Staciana Stitts, 18, finished second in 1:07.79.
</P>
<P>
B.J. Bedford became another veteran winner after Tara Torres
and Jenny Thompson as the 27-year-old timed in first in the women'
s 100m backstroke in 1:01.85, a promising mark against the world
record of 1:00.16 set by Chinese He Cihong in October, 1994.
</P>
<P>
Courtney Shealy, 22, also qualified by finishing second in 1:02.

<P>
BOGOTA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton will
pay a visit to Cartagena, Colombia, this month, said Colombian
Foreign Minister Guillermo Fernandez de Soto on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the improvement in ties between the Colombia and the
United States since Andres Pastrana assumed the Colombian
presidency on August 7,1998, the foreign minister said the recent
exchange of visits had helped strengthen bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's impending visit is the result of such exchanges
including President Pastrana's visits to the United States and the
trip by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said preparations for Clinton's visit to Colombia, the 4th
by a U.S. president, were discussed Thursday during a meeting in
Cartagena between Pastrana and U.S. Under Secretary of State
Thomas Pickering.
</P>
<P>
An agenda for the visit will be worked out in the next few days.

<HEADLINE> Torres Cramps Up, Scratches from 200m Freestyle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Dara Torres, who has
qualified for her fourth Olympic Games on Thursday, suffered a
cramp in the 200m freestyle heats on Friday which will keep her
out of thesemifinals at night.
</P>
<P>
Torres, 33, won her preliminary in hopes of a possible spot on
the 4x200 free relay team in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Soon after, however, she was leaning on the wall of the warmup
pool in pain. Coach Richard Quick rushed to her side and ushered
her to an area by the diving pool, where was covered in towels and
massaged by her trainers.
</P>
<P>
The diagnosis was severe uterine cramps that will keep her out
of the semifinals tonight.
</P>
<P>
"I felt like I didn't want to take any chances at this point,
and the fact that she really wanted to do well in the 100 free was
the main purpose (for the scratch)," said Quick. "She'll probably
need a couple of days to recover."
</P>
<P>
The 100 free preliminaries start Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Stanford team doctor Glen Luepnitz said the problem is nothing
new for Torres: "It happens all the time in the long races. It's
debilitating. But we took care of her and she was starting to feel
much better."
</P>
<P>
The upside for Torres, who earned a spot in Sydney on Thursday
by finishing second to Jenny Thompson in the 100m freestyle final,
is that this setback doesn't necessarily remove her from
contention for the 4x200 free relay team in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Torres still can petition the U.S. women's head coach to be
included on that squad, and that U.S. women's head coach happens
to be Quick.
</P>
<P>
Torres' prelim time on Friday was 2 minutes 1.04 seconds, and
her best time this year is 2:00.25.

<HEADLINE> China's Textile Industry Reports High Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- China's textile industry
registered a strong growth in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily reported that profits of the sector surged
a year-on-year 220 percent to reach 10.7 billion yuan (about 1.3
billion U.S. dollars) in the January-June period.
</P>
<P>
Industry experts expect the profits to exceed 20 billion yuan (
about 2.4 billion U.S. dollars) for the whole year, compared to
eight billion yuan (about 960 million U.S. dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
Both production and sales have seen a rapid growth between
January and June.
</P>
<P>
Production of synthesized fiber, yarn, cloth and silk--China's
four major textile products--has had two-digit month-by-month
increases in the first half of the year, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Total sales for China's 18,426 textile firms was 362.1 billion
yuan (about 43.63 billion U.S. dollars) during the period, up 24.7
percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Flouring exports, expanding investment and rising domestic
prices for textile products pushed up the industry's production
and sales, an official with the State Administration of Textile
Industry was quoted by the paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
China exported 23.83 billion U.S. dollars worth of textile
products from January to June, up 41.8 percent on a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
Fixed assets investment in the industry increased 31 percent to
5.9 billion yuan (about 710 million U.S. dollars), next only to
the electronics and telecommunications industries.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's Cotton Yarn Production Up in 1999-2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar produced 4,838.7 tons of
cotton yarn in fiscal year 1999-2000 which ended in March, 18.5
percent more than the 4,080.5 tons in 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest data released by the country's Central
Statistical Organization, Myanmar also produced 19,255,260 meters
of cotton fabrics in the fiscal year, up 61.8 percent over the
previous fiscal year which saw a production of 11,895,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
In the 1999-2000, Myanmar produced a total of 177,375 tons of
cotton out of 341,820 hectares cultivated. During the year, the
government purchased 24,750 tons of cotton.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar places emphasis on cultivation of cotton in Mandalay,
Sagaing and Magway divisions, the three central arid zones in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, to maintain the enthusiasm of cotton growers and
relieve a shortage in investment capital, the government not only
provides more than 1 billion kyats (3 million U.S. dollars) of
loans to the cotton growers in the country annually, but also
grants advance payment for the purchase of cotton.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's locally-produced cotton fabrics are reportedly not
enough to meet demand. The country has to import them from China,
India,Thailand and South Korea.

<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Mexican President-
elect Vicente Fox proposed here Friday a ceiling for oil prices to
stabilize the oil market.
</P>
<P>
"We defend the price of crude and want to work in consensus
with other oil producing countries," Fox told the press at a
Montevideo air base before returning to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
"We think that a ceiling must be included in the quotation to
avoid affecting the economies of countries with which we negotiate
and trade, because that affects our own development," he said.
</P>
<P>
The soon-to-be president defined the fairest oil prices as
between 20 and 30 U.S. dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Fox left here for home at the end of a South American tour that
took him to Chile, Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay. He was scheduled

BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Following are the highlights of
today's major Beijing-based newspapers:
</P>
<P>
People's Daily
</P>
<P>
-- East China's Zhejiang Province recently signed agreements
with the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and Gansu Province in
the west, pledging to invest 6.3 billion yuan (about 759 million U.
S. dollars) in Xinjiang and Gansu. This makes the coastal province
the biggest investor in China's western region.
</P>
<P>
-- A grand meeting was held at the Great Hall of the People
here Friday to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the
Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, one of China's non-
Communist parties. Jiang Zemin, Chinese president and general
secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, wrote
an inscription for the occasion: "Unite and Strive for the
Rejuvenation of the Chinese nation".
</P>
<P>
Xinhua Daily Telegraph
</P>
<P>
-- Colleges and universities in 19 Chinese provinces,
municipalities and autonomous regions enrolled fresh students
through the Internet on a trial basis this year.
</P>
<P>
-- Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao made a
comment Friday on some Japanese cabinet members' decision to visit
the Yasukuni Shrine, a bastion of the wartime government-sponsored
Shintoism and symbol of militarism in Japan before and during
World War II. He said that paying homage to the shrine concerns
whether or not a correct attitude is adopted towards the history
of aggression committed by Japanese militarists in the past, which
constitutes the core of the matter.

<HEADLINE> Exams Open Civil Service to Ordinary Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- About 4,400 ordinary Chinese
citizens have been recruited as civil servants after taking open
qualification exams since 1996.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily referred to the development as a major step
forward in reforming China's recruitment system.
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who wants to be a civil servant must be recruited
through open examinations," Dai Guangqian, vice-minister of
personnel, was quoted as saying by the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The new recruits--11 percent of those who took the tests--have
got jobs by using their own abilities rather than being
recommended by high-ranking officials or through nepotism,
according to the official.
</P>
<P>
All but four agencies of the State Council have recruited civil
servants using the new exams and most of those who passed the
tests were under 35 and had a college degree or a higher diploma.
</P>
<P>
The exams include a written examination which determines the
participants' general and professional knowledge. There is then an
interview for those who pass.
</P>
<P>
The reform has put an end to the so-called "iron rice bowl" in
the civil service, where employees were given a job for life
regardless of their abilities. It has also opened up careers for
other people regardless of their background or social status,
officials in charge of the reform said.

<HEADLINE> More Tibetans to Have Solar-Powered Electricity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- China's State Development
Planning Commission and the State Power Corporation have launched
a plan to give Tibet's Ngari Prefecture solar-powered electricity
by 2003, ending its history of using oil lamps.
</P>
<P>
Some 8,000 power generating units will be built by 2001,
turning on lights and televisions for about 11,000 households
there, according to a report of today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
By 2003, schools, clinics and hospitals in the prefecture are
expected to have their solar electric facilities installed.
</P>
<P>
Topography makes it difficult to popularize coal and other
conventional power sources in the prefecture, but solar power will
work because of extensive daylight, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The plan is part of a national program to accelerate economic
and social development in Tibet.

BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are highlights of
major news on health care and medical research in China over the
past week:
</P>
<P>
 China-made Anti-Aids Drug Experimented in Thailand
</P>
<P>
Clinical experiments in Thailand on 28 people with AIDS have
proven that a China-made compound pharmaceutical drug is effective
in the treatment of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The medicine Fufang SH was developed by a group of Chinese
scientist headed by Luo Shide, a professor at the Kunming
Botanical Research Institute under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The experiment was carried out on the patients at Sapatong
hospital of Ban Chiang Mai city in Thailand, according to an
agreement signed between Thailand and the Kunming Botanical
Research Institute in July 1999.

 Fish Cornea Transplant Helps Restore Eyesight
</P>
<P>
A young man's debilitating eyesight has improved after
undergoing a cornea transplant using the cornea of a fish, the
first transplant of its kind in China, which also gives hope to
many other people with cornea problems.
</P>
<P>
Xu Xiaoyong, 19, a resident in Shenzhen bordering Hong Kong,
suffered from a cornea ulceration in his left eye last June.
</P>
<P>
He was in urgent need of a cornea transplant, but the hospital
couldn't find a proper human cornea transplant donor. Doctors
decided to use a fish cornea instead of a human one on July 5.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that half of the blindness that occurs among
Chinese people is due to cornea problem. Using the fish cornea has
provided a new alternative material for cornea transplants.
</P>
<P>
 Cause of Congenital Heart Diseases Found
</P>
<P>
Sufferers of congenital heart diseases, which make up eight
percent of the world's congenital heart disease population, are
likely to be cured by repairing a gene called CX43.
</P>
<P>
"It is the abnormality of CX43 that directly leads to
congenital heart diseases," said Huang Guoying, professor of the
Medical School of Shanghai's prestigious Fudan University.
</P>
<P>
Huang's research indicates that the abnormality of CX43, an
intercellular connective protein, prevents neural crest cells from
developing into stromal cells in the heart of an embryo, thus
hindering the growth of the efferent tract of the heart and
resulting in congenital heart diseases like pulmonary stenosis. (

China Develops Genetic Pesticide
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists have developed a genetically modified
pesticide which is said to be able to get rid of the most vicious
vegetable pests.
</P>
<P>
Professor Qi Yipeng, who is in charge of the group at Wuhan
University in Hubei Province which developed the pesticide, said
that the new pesticide is environmentally friendly and able to
kill eight percent of sugar beet noctuids, minor vegetable moths
and dark-green moths within two to three days.
</P>
<P>
The scientists developed the pesticide by combining the genetic
elements of two existing viruses of vegetable pests. The pesticide
does no harm the natural enemies of the vegetable pests. It is
also totally harmless to man and animals, and will not produce any
residues that pollute the environment.

<P>
JAKARTA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- A tectonic earthquake measuring
4.8 on the Richter scale jolted Lampung Province in Indonesia's
Sumatra island on Friday night, but there was no immediate report
of casualties.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Kotabumi geophysics station in North Lampung Adi
Supriyanto said the epicenter of the quake was located at 5.43
degrees south latitude and 105.19 degrees east longitude.
</P>
<P>
"Based on the provisional result of our analysis, the tectonic
quake only hit Bandar Lampung (capital of the province) because
its epicenter is located 15 kilometers west of Bandar Lampung. It
did not affect other areas or districts in the province," he was
quoted by the Antara News Agency Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Friday night's quake was the third to hit Indonesia in the past
two and a half months after a powerful one devastated Bengkulu
Province in Sumatra and a tremor jolted the West Java district of
Sukabumi.

<HEADLINE> Italian Government Launches Crackdown on Tax Evasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Italian Finance Ministry
launched a crackdown Friday on firms using the tiny mountain-top
Republic of San Marino as a tax haven, initiating a policy of
minute inspections targeting import-export companies in particular.
</P>
<P>
The tough line was announced by Finance Minister Ottaviano Del
Turco, who issued a circular to the ministry's regional tax
offices ordering them to "carry out X-rays on firms which do
business with the Republic of San Marino."
</P>
<P>
Del Turco ordered the checks to begin immediately, saying that
the use of San Marino as a "fiscal paradise" had to be stopped.
</P>
<P>
The circular said that companies dealing in imports and exports
were a prime target and would be subject to thorough checks.
</P>
<P>
San Marino Minister of Foreign and Political Affairs Gabriele
Gatti immediately expressed his indignation at the news.
</P>
<P>
He said that "this initiative is contrary to talks which are
underway between San Marino and Italy on collaborating in the
fight against tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time that the Italian Finance Ministry
has attempted to clamp down on San Marino, whose tax system is
highly attractive to businessmen from around the world.
</P>
<P>
In July 1997, inspectors blocked the roads leading into the
republic for some ten days while they checked all the goods
entering and leaving the land-locked state.
</P>
<P>
This operation concluded with the signing of an accord between
Italy and San Marino providing for greater bilateral collaboration
in the fight against tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
Then in 1998, a similar crackdown took place, with some 1,800
policemen swooping down on a range of companies across Italy which
commonly do business with the Republic.
</P>
<P>
San Marino, which has a population of some 25,500, is one of
the oldest state in Europe and was founded at the beginning of the
4th century.
</P>
<P>
It has preserved its independence for more than sixteen
centuries and has its own government, mint, postage stamps, police
force, army and tax system.

<HEADLINE> Kuerten, Henman Meet in Semifinals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- French Open champion Gustavo
Kuerten beat Todd Martin in three sets Friday in the quarterfinals
of the Tennis Masters Series-Cincinnati in Mason, Ohio, the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Kuerten's 6-7 (0), 6-3, 7-6 (5) victory took 2 hours, 38
minutes as the Brazilian wore down Martin despite a blister on his
racket hand that required medical attention.
</P>
<P>
Martin had beaten Kuerten in their only previous match, in
1997, and seemed to be heading for a repeat when he won the first-
set tiebreaker 7-0.
</P>
<P>
Then he faltered briefly in the third.
</P>
<P>
While serving in game six, Kuerten called for a trainer, who
put tape on the blister on his right ring finger. He continued to
be bothered, although he removed the tape, and failed to hold his
serve.
</P>
<P>
Martin held serve and seemed to be in control at 5-2.
</P>
<P>
Just then, Martin was having problems, too, and was not able
to put Kuerten away. He double faulted in game nine and failed to
hold his serve, putting Kuerten back on track.
</P>
<P>
Martin gave up the first three points in the tiebreaker, then
rallied to take a 5-4 lead. But Kuerten won the next three points,
including one on a 126 mph ace.
</P>
<P>
15th-seeded Tim Henman of Britain beat Fabrice Santoro of
France 6-1, 6-4 on Friday and will meet Kuerten in Saturday's
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
The other quarterfinal matchups were No. 7 Thomas Enqvist of
Sweden vs. Fernando Vicente of Spain, and No. 13 Franco Squillari
of Argentina vs. Arnaud Clement of France.

<HEADLINE> Hingis Beats Frazier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Martina Hingis got a sweet
revenge when she beat Amy Frazier, who upset Hingis last week in
the quarterfinals of the Acura Classic, in straight sets of 6-2, 6-
1 in the quarterfinals of the estyle.com Classic in Manhatta Beach.
</P>
<P>
Hingis, the No. 1 player in the world and top seed in the
tournament at the Manhattan Country Club, needed only 53 minutes
to beat Frazier, the 20th-ranked player in the world.
</P>
<P>
In Saturday's semifinals, Hingis faces defending champion and
fifth-seeded Serena Williams.
</P>
<P>
In another quarterfinal match Friday, Elena Dementieva of
Russia rallied for a 2-6, 6-1, 6-4 victory over Lisa Raymond in a
matchup of unseeded players.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old Dementieva faces the winner of Friday night's
quarterfinal match between No. 2 Lindsay Davenport and No. 8
Sandrine Testud of France in Saturday's other semifinal.
</P>
<P>
Williams, who begins defense of her U.S. Open championship
later this month, reached the semifinals with a 6-2, 4-6, 6-2
triumph over No. 4 Conchita Martinez of Spain.
</P>
<P>
The finals will be played Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Hingis, 19, has now beaten Frazier, 27, five times in six
lifetime meetings. This match was never in doubt.
</P>
<P>
Frazier won this tournament in 1994 while Hingis is trying to
win it for the first time in four tries.
</P>
<P>
Frazier didn't manage to win too many in this match. The only
games she won were the third and sixth of the first set and third
of the second set.
</P>
<P>
Dementieva, playing in this tournament for the first time,
needed 1 hour, 38 minutes to eliminate Raymond, doing so by
winning 12 of the match's final 17 games.

<HEADLINE> Drought Spreading in Major Chinese Grain Producer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, August 12 (Xinhua) -- More than 6.4 million people in
east China's Anhui Province, a major grain producer, are doing
their best to combat the worst drought in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
About 400,000 pumps are being used and millions of dollars
spent to fight the drought. Severe drought began to hit the
province in June due to long periods of hot weather and lack of
rain. The northern part of the province has had only half as much
rainfall as that in recent years.
</P>
<P>
By August 8, the drought had affected more than three million
hectares of crops and had caused serious water shortages for 3.14
million people and 760,000 heads of livestock.
</P>
<P>
Hefei, the provincial capital, has limited the quantity of
water supply and banned watering lawns with running water since
August 9.
</P>
<P>
The local agricultural department estimates that the drought
has led to at least 4.6 billion yuan (about 554 million U.S.
dollars) of direct economic losses.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that dry weather will continue throughout
August in the province.

<HEADLINE> Greene and Jones Win Their 100 Meters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
GENEVA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- World record holder Maurice
Green came back from injury to reasserted himself as Olympic
favorite Friday as he ton the men's 100m at the Weltklasse Golden
League track meet in Zurich.
</P>
<P>
American sprint sensation Marion Jones maintained her unbeaten
record this year to take the title of the women's 100m, but
received an alarming forewarning from compatriot Inger Miller,
reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hicham El Guerrouj and Gabriela Szabo also declared
their Olympic intentions loud and clear, ran the fastest times of
the season in the 1,500 and 3,000 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Greene, who sufuered a strained hamstring at the U.S.trials
last month during a 200 showdown against arch-rival Michael
Johnson, crossed in 9.94, leading a tough field that included
eight of the top-10 sprinters this season.
</P>
<P>
Obadele Thompson of Barbados was second in 9.97, while
Trinidad's Ato Boldon was third in 10.00 flat.
</P>
<P>
Jones had her closest moment of the season, barely edging
compatriot and runner-up Inger Miller by a wafer-thin .01.
</P>
<P>
Merlene Ottey, racing in her first major international event
since she was cleared of doping charges last month, showed the
forced hiatus had not overly affected her form, crossing third in
11.06.
</P>
<P>
Jones, unbeaten this year, had looked untouchable till now.
But Miller's close second changed that.
</P>
<P>
"It was of course a little harder after the false start but I
put it back together. Neither part was the best," Jones said
before running off to compete in the long jump, another event she
hopes to win in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Jones and rival Zhanna Pintusevich of the Ukraine, are tied
with two Golden League wins each this season.
</P>
<P>
Ottey, who has a record seven Olympic medals and will be
lining up against Jones in Sydney, was relieved by her third place
performance.
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old made her first return to the track two weeks
ago, winning the 100 in a modest 11.42 at a low-key meet in Nuoro,
Sardinia.
</P>
<P>
El Guerrouj crossed in 3 minutes, 27.21, comfortably beating
21-year-old Noah Ngeny of Kenya who had the previous best time
this year of 3:29.99.
</P>
<P>
Ngeny finished in 3:28.12 while countryman Bernard Lagat was
third in 3:28.51.
</P>
<P>
Szabo completed the 3,000m in 8:26.35, slashing 6.72 off the
season's previous best 8:33.07. She went undefeated last season
and lost her first race this year in London last week in the 1,500.
</P>
<P>
Former world champion Maria Mutola of Mozambique won the women
's 800 for the eighth consecutive year, crossing in 1:56.90, the
third-best time of the season. European indoor titlist Stephanie
Graf of Austria was second in 1:57.34, while reigning world
champion Ludmila Formanova of the Czech Republic was third in 1:57.

<HEADLINE> Pacers' Jackson Signs with Toronto Raptors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jackson, who earlier said to end his career in Pacers, accepted
a reported 14 million U.S. dollars contract for the Raptors to be
coached by Hall of Famer Lennie Wilkens.
</P>
<P>
"It's an honor to be here (Toronto)," Jackson said. "I just
thank God for allowing a guy like me to be 35 years old and still
be able to play a little bit."
</P>
<P>
Jackson helped the Pacers reach the NBA Finals for the first
time last season. He said the Raptors did the best job of showing
him he was wanted, which he called the key factor in his decision.
</P>
<P>
"Mark's record ... as a basketball player and a person speaks
for itself," Raptors general manager Glen Grunwald said.
</P>
<P>
Pacers president Donnie Walsh said Thursday he had wanted to re-
sign Jackson, but acknowledged the team couldn't match a contract
from a team with plenty of salary cap room.
</P>
<P>
Grunwald made acquiring a point guard one of his top offseason
priorities for an offense that relied almost exclusively on star
forward Vince Carter. The loss of free agent Tracy McGrady, who
signed with Orlando last week, freed up money to pursue Jackson.
</P>
<P>
Jackson is the Raptors' first free-agent signing this summer.
</P>
<P>
Jackson has also played for the New York Knicks and Los Angeles
Clippers during his 13-year career and ranks fifth in NBA career
assists. He averaged 8.1 points and 8 assists in 27 minutes for
the Pacers last season.

<HEADLINE> OAU Chief Urges Respect of Ceasefire in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African Unity
(OAU) Secretary General Salim Ahamed Salim on Saturday urged all
warring parties to the two-year conflict in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC) to respect the Lusaka ceasefire
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Salim hoped that the summit of all the six countries involved
in the war on Monday in the Zambian capital will eliminate the
obstacles to the implementation of the agreement they signed one
year ago.
</P>
<P>
Salim, who arrived here to attend the summit aimed to put the
peace process back on track, called for creating conditions for
the long-delayed deployment of 5,500 U.N.peacekeeping forces and
military observers in the DRC to monitor the ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
The deployment approved by the U.N. Security Council in
February has been withheld because of continued fighting in the
DRC.
</P>
<P>
The conflict, which broke out in August 1998, has sucked in
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia, which support DRC President Laurent
Kabila, and Rwanda and Uganda, which back different rebel groups
in the DRC.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Americans to Support Al Gore, Lieberman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The reason I want Al Gore and Joe Lieberman to win this
election is, I know they'll keep the prosperity going. I know they
'll keep us moving into the future, but most important of all,
they'll make sure we all go along for the ride," Clinton said at a
fund-raiser for Democratic U.S. Representative Xavier Becerra of
California.
</P>
<P>
It was Clinton's first in a string of glittering fundraisers,
tributes and schmooze sessions with Hollywood stars and Democrats
ahead of the party's national convention which begins Monday.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton would use his
appearances in Los Angeles ahead of the convention to fine-tune
his speech Monday evening, which is likely to be his last major
political address before a wide audience.
</P>
<P>
Clinton called for a civil but vigorous election debate. "We've
had enough of the politics of personal destruction, but we'll
never get enough of the politics of honest debate over differences,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
He accused Republicans of failing to disclose the specifics of
their policy agenda in Philadelphia earlier this month and said
major differences existed over tax policy, gun control, health
care, Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
The president praised Lieberman, Gore's running mate, despite
the Connecticut U.S. senator's early and sharp criticisms of the
president over the Monica Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
"I've known Joe Lieberman for 30 years. He helped me develop a
lot of the ideas that I brought to the '92 campaign that we
implemented, and he deserves your support. In every way you will
be more than pleased," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Gore, he said, "This is a guy that I know will do
what he thinks is right. He will look to the long-term interests
of the country and he has the right economic program to keep the
prosperity going and to extend its benefits to the people who are
still left behind."

<HEADLINE> Colombian Rebel ELN Lifts Roadblocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's rebel National
Liberation Army (ELN) announced Saturday that it is
suspending the blockade of roads as of today, but will maintain
other offensive actions.
</P>
<P>
"We are announcing that the blockade of the highways will be
suspended starting at 12 midnight August 12 (local time), but we
will continue with the rest of our military activities," said the
ELN leadership in a communique issued for the press.
</P>
<P>
The "armed stoppage" has left several people dead and dozens of
vehicles burned and high electricity conductors towers collapsed,
in a "forceful" rejection to the first two years of the government
of President Andres Pastrana, whose mandate ends in August of 2002.
</P>
<P>
The rebels said that the organization has, during the
development of the "armed stoppage", installed 32 roadblocks in
the main highways of the country, toppled 32 energy towers,
committed 18 attacks with explosives against oil pipelines, and
has perpetrated 15 attacks against the armed forces and the
paramilitary, causing 63 casualties in the enemy ranks.
</P>
<P>
An ELN faction in the southwest of the country had said in the
middle of the week that the "armed stoppage" was decreed as a
protest against the visit to the country by U.S. President Bill
Clinton August 30.
</P>
<P>
The ELN and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)
reject Clinton's visit and a 1.3 billion dollar assistance from
Washington to Bogota for the war against drugs. They said the
visit will inflame the internal conflict and represent a prelude
to a U.S. direct military intervention in the South American
country.
</P>
<P>
The Pastrana government has been negotiating since October of
1999 a peace agreement with the FARC and plans to do the same with
the ELN.
</P>
<P>
The FARC and the ELN are the main guerrilla groups in the
country, with 12,000 and 5,000 combating members, respectively.

<HEADLINE> Survey Finds More Swiss Choose to Live Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- More and more Swiss citizens are
choosing to move overseas with more than 580,000 people now living
abroad, according to the Swiss foreign ministry.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures, released on Friday, show that the number of
Swiss choosing to emigrate has steadily increased over the past 10
years.
</P>
<P>
In the past 12 months, nearly 7,500 Swiss set off to seek a new
life abroad. Since 1990, 126,000 Swiss have emigrated, with around
60 per cent choosing to settle in the European Union. Most opt for
France, which has a Swiss expatriate population of over 150,000.
</P>
<P>
Rudolf Wyder, the director of Swiss Abroad, said that one major
reason for the growing emigration is that people move away to
study elsewhere and then carry on their lives in the adopted
country.
</P>
<P>
"People leave Switzerland for educational purposes. Swiss
citizens living abroad then get married and their partners may
later acquire Swiss nationality. And then the families decide to
have children," Wyder explained.
</P>
<P>
The figures from the foreign office suggest that Swiss women
are more likely to emigrate - they make up 60 percent of the total
expatriate population.
</P>
<P>
The majority of expatriates choose to become citizens of their
host countries: nearly 70 percent (405,921) now hold foreign
passports. After France, the biggest expatriate communities are in
Germany (67,728), Italy (41,140), the United States (67,929) and
Canada (34,192).

WASHINGTON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Gary Hall, a swimmer
suffering diabetes, advanced to the semifinals of the men's 100m
freestyle at the U.S. Olympic swimming trials in Indianapolis on
Saturday, by qualifying the second-fastest in the preliminaries.
</P>
<P>
Despite only two 100m freestyle races in the past two years,
Hall, who was diagnosed diabetic in March 1999, swam 49.10 seconds,
only next to Neil Walker's 48.75.
</P>
<P>
Sabir Muhammad was on his way to become the first black to join
the U.S. Olympic swim team as he qualified seventh in the
preliminaries.
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult overcoming that," said Hall, who was suspended
by FINA for a positive marijuana test in May 1998. "It limits a
lot of the aerobic work I'm able to do."
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, Hall finished second twice to Russian Alexander
Popov in the 50m and 100m freestyles in the Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
In the heats of other events, Misty Hyman beat the field in the
women's 200m freestyle by clocking the seventh-fastest time of 2:
09.92 in the world this year.
</P>
<P>
Kyle Salyards, 19, was quickest in the men's 200m breaststroke
preliminaries, beating Ed Moses, who already qualified for the
Olympic team from the 100m breaststroke.

<HEADLINE> Israel Asks EU to Coordinate With U.S. in Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Israel Foreign Minister Shlomo
Ben Ami on Saturday urged the European Union (EU) to coordinate
its efforts with the United States in solving the Middle East
conflict because they do "not always agree with each other in
their plans".
</P>
<P>
Ben Ami made the call here after meeting with EU foreign policy
representative Javier Solana.
</P>
<P>
Solana stated the EU's willingness to respect the proclamation
of the Palestine State scheduled for September 13, but warned that
the 15 EU member countries have not determined "when it is going
to be implemented or to be recognized by Europe."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli minister suggested the EU not to back that plan. He
warned the Palestinians that if they implement that plan, they
will damage their own cause at a moment in which they had better
prepare to resume the dialogue in September and not unduly delay
the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The time to reach an agreement is "limited," Ben Ami said,
adding that if this opportunity is not seized, things can go "from
bad to worse".

<HEADLINE> Italians Concerned Over Food Quality, Says Environmental Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Italians are increasingly concerned
over the quality, contents and origins of their food, a report by
environmentalist group Legambiente revealed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that chemical substances and hormones were the
Italians' greatest fear (more than 76 percent), closely followed
by additives and colorants (73.9 percent).
</P>
<P>
Meat and meat derivatives also sounded an alarm for the
majority of those questioned, with 73.9 percent expressing
concerns over what animals are fed and how they are raised.
</P>
<P>
The report said one widespread belief was that "they probably
boost growth in animals, as they are clearly not raised naturally".
</P>
<P>
The majority of consumers turned to well-known brand names for
reassurance, either because they offer some quality control or at
least some recourse in case something goes wrong.
</P>
<P>
It said that consumers also preferred national produce
following recent food scares all of which originated abroad, and
prefer a butcher they know who can be trusted to sell Italian
goods, produced locally if possible.
</P>
<P>
Almost 52 percent of those questioned said they would like
stricter laws and more frequent, tighter checks by authorities,
and 39.7 percent said they would feel happier with clear labeling
detailing the origin of meat and production methods.

<HEADLINE> Rinderpest Eradicated in Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia has wiped out
rinderpest following an extensive campaign against the disease
across the country since 1989, an official of the Ministry of
Agriculture said at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
About 56 million cattle have been inoculated against rinderpest
over the last 10 years, All African Rinderpest Eradication
Campaign Project coordinator Seleshi Zewde told mass media.
</P>
<P>
Inoculation against rinderpest has stopped as of last year when
the eradication of the disease was confirmed in all states of the
country, he said, noting 140 million birr (about 16 million U.S.
dollars) were spent on the national campaign.
</P>
<P>
To win international recognition that it is rinderpest free,
Ethiopia should prove that the disease would not surface again for
the next five years, the coordinator said.
</P>
<P>
A project charged with the task of verifying the eradication of
the disease from the country has established, he said, adding a
program to focus on launching emergency vaccination campaign in
case the plague reappears has also been formulated.

Out of the total amount of the money, 227.3 million dollars
went to the private sector, Abdurazak said.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Investigate War Losses: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia has established a
special committee to investigate, assess and produce
recommendations on damages caused by its war against Eritrea,
local weekly Fortune reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The committee, which will be working under the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, is charged with the investigating the fate of 127
million U.S. dollars worth of goods stranded at Eritrean ports
after the start of the conflict in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Ethiopian businessmen, who claimed to have lost
more than 100 million dollars, said that they were unable to
collect, or take their cases with the Eritrean government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ethiopian insurance companies are also reluctant to
compensate the businessmen, saying that their policy does not
cover loss caused by acts of war.
</P>
<P>
In addition to collecting and studying compensation appeals
filed by the businessmen, the committee will also assess the
damage caused to infrastructure of Zalambessa, an Ethiopian border
town of about 15,000 people in Tigray State, that was leveled to
the ground during the occupation of Eritrean troops.
</P>
<P>
Allegations of human rights abuses by Eritrean forces will also
be investigated by this committee, the weekly said.
</P>
<P>
Under the auspices of the Organization of African Unity,
Ethiopia and Eritrea signed a ceasefire agreement in June.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are expected to settle their border disputes
and war compensation problems through negotiations after the
deployment of United Nations peacekeeping forces along their
border.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Vice-President Urges Leaders to Shun Tribalism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Vice-President George
Saitoti has urged leaders in the country to unite people and not
divide them along tribal lines.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president made the remarks on Saturday when he
inspected a commercial building being undertaken by a women's
group in Ngong town not far from the capital of Nairobi, the
Sunday Standard newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Saitoti said tribalism created hatred among people, adding that
the vice had caused ethnic friction and bloodshed in many African
countries.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it was wrong for some leaders to use tribalism as
a means of achieving their political goals and also to spread
hatred through irresponsible utterances.
</P>
<P>
It was important for Kenyans to coexist harmoniously
irrespective of their ethnicity or political affiliation, he added.
</P>
<P>
Saitoti urged them to uphold peace, saying the country was
blessed to have enjoyed peace and stability since independence
despite experiencing social and economic hardships.
</P>
<P>
On the drought situation, the vice-president assured local
people that the government would continue to provide famine relief
food to those affected.

<HEADLINE> Gas Shortage Hits Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Kenya faces a severe shortage of
liquefied petroleum gas following last weekend's fire at the Kenya
Petroleum Refineries at Changamwe, Mombasa, an Indian oceanic port
city in southeastern Kenya.

whose outlets in Mombasa have been running without cooking gas
stocks were by Saturday awaiting the arrival of imports from the

<HEADLINE> Species Hunting Licenses Banned to be Issued in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has banned
the issuance of species licences because of gross abuse by hunters
who resort to killing prime animals indiscriminately, Sunday Times
of Zambia newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The ban was issued by Tourism Minister Ansoshi Chipawa who
feared that the wanton killing of prime species such as lions,
pythons and elephants threatened the viability of the tourism
industry. It was published following the minister's discovery
that 108 licences were issued last month for hunting in some areas.
</P>
<P>
Chipawa's action has been exacerbated by reports that a lot of
foreign hunters were obtaining of species licence without
following laid down procedures.
</P>
<P>
Because of indiscriminate killing of prime animals, the
elephant population has gone down from 250,000 in 1992 to 20,000
last year.
</P>
<P>
The transformation of the department of National Parks and
Wildlife to the Zambia Wildlife Authority had put a lot of
pressure on the new body as poaching was on the rise, the report
said.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Doctors Get Information Facilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Ministry of Health has
launched a new technology which enables doctors in rural areas to
consult directly with experts in the capital of Kampala through
the use of video link, the New Vision reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The telemedicine uses information technologies to distribute
information in form of images, voice and data, and the facility is
connected to computers and telephone and offers live video
conferencing, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The new technology will reduce the professional gap between
country doctors and consultants in Kampala, said State Minister of
Health Phillip Byaruhanga.
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the ministry's undertakings in improving
medical services delivery in the country by helping doctors
competently manage cases through consultations among themselves,"
Byaruhanga was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Francis Omaswa, director general for Health Service, said that
the new technology would also be used in the sharing of medical
information among researchers and other shareholders in the

<HEADLINE> Burundi's Pro-Tutsi Parties Say Key Issues Unresolved for Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Burundi's pro-Tutsi
parties involved in the peace talks aimed at ending the country's
seven-year civil war have claimed that many important elements in
the draft peace agreement have not been resolved at the end of one-
week negotiations held in Tanzania's northern town of Arusha.
</P>
<P>
The official Sunday News here quoted the parties, popularly
known as Group Ten (G-10), as saying in a press communique
released on Saturday that important issues such as the electoral
system, restructuring of the army, guarantees on the
implementation of the peace accord and ceasefire have not been
completed.
</P>
<P>
This round of talks was billed as final before the signing of a
power-sharing peace accord, which has been set by international
mediator and former South African President Nelson Mandela on
August 28.
</P>
<P>
However, speaking on behalf of his other nine colleagues,
Ulibere Bararunyeretse, chief of the delegation of the UPRONA
party said on Saturday that they have not exhausted their talks
and urged the pro-Hutu parties (G-7) to reconsider some of their
positions to reach a consensus.
</P>
<P>
He said a transitional government could only be formed once the
major issues were resolved.
</P>
<P>
The G-10 also alleged that the facilitation team did not take
into account some of their positions during initial discussions,
and instead dished out draft proposals that favored the Hutus,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
The draft agreement was distributed to the parties last month,
but the heads of delegations are still at odds on a number of
issues.
</P>
<P>
Several main players, which include the Burundi government led
by President Pierre Buyoya, and the two major armed Hutu rebel
groups, CNDD-FDD and PALIPEHUTU-FNL, have indicated they will not
sign the document as it is or until certain conditions are met.
</P>
<P>
The current wrangling has prompted many observers to note that
the signing ceremony, scheduled for August 28, now hangs in the
balance, although Mandela insists that the date will be adhered to.
</P>
<P>
Under the draft proposals, the Tutsi minority, which has
dominated Burundi since independence, would hand over power to a
democratically elected government in three years' time after the
appointment of a transitional government.
</P>
<P>
Fighting in the tiny central African country has cost more than
200,000 lives, mostly civilians, uprooted many more from their
homes and driven others into exile since it began in October 1993
when Tutsi paratroopers assassinated the country's first
democratically elected president Melchoir Ndadaye, a Hutu.

<HEADLINE> Thousands Attend Protestant Parade in Northern Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of members of the
Protestant Apprentice Boys group in Londonderry Saturday
celebrated one of the biggest events in the Protestant marching
calendar amid tight security.
</P>
<P>
The parade passed off without major incident, despite an
earlier bomb alert which closed a railway line leading to the
Northern Irish city of Londonderry.
</P>
<P>
The march, featuring about 15,000 Apprentice boys and
supporters as well as 170 bands, went ahead after the two sides in
the city struck a deal earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
Rival nationalists and loyalists heckled each other during the
parade.
</P>
<P>
The march came a day after 227 kilograms of explosives were
made safe after a vehicle crashed through a checkpoint in the
center of Londonderry. It was later found abandoned in Donegal.
</P>
<P>
The police said they believed the explosives were planned for
the city.
</P>
<P>
There have been a number of discoveries of explosives linked
with the dissidents who are opposed to the 1998 Good Friday
Agreement and the current political process in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
A bomb alert on the railway line hampered trains carrying
hundreds of march participants bound for Londonderry and
alternative arrangements had to be made.
</P>
<P>
The Apprentice Boys demonstrate every August to commemorate the
Relief of Derry from the forces of the Catholic King James II in
1689.
</P>
<P>
The Parades Commission in Northern Ireland imposed restrictions
on a number of Apprentice Boys feeder parades on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The commission also placed route restrictions on an Orange
Order parade in Portadown, County Armagh, on Sunday, and some
conditions on a nationalist march in Lurgan on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Ireland Parades Commission was established in 1997
to determine whether conditions should be placed on contentious
parades in Northern Ireland.

<HEADLINE> Hollywood Star Loretta Young Dies At 87  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Young died of ovarian cancer at about 3 a.m. Pacific time at
the Los Angeles home of her half-sister Georgian Montalban and
actor Ricardo Montalban, her spokesman Joel Brokaw said.
</P>
<P>
She had been released from hospital recently after undergoing
abdominal surgery in July, Brokaw said.
</P>
<P>
Young, an actress who embodied all the elegance and grace of a
movie star, is best remembered for her Oscar-winning role in the
1947 film comedy "The Farmer's Daughter" and her weekly grand
entrances in flowing gowns on the long-running NBC television
series "The Loretta Young Show."
</P>
<P>
Both on and off the screen, Miss Young presented the image of
serene uprightness. In 88 movies dating from 1927 to 1953, she
invariably played the strong-willed heroine with firm principles.
</P>
<P>
Her career reached its zenith with the 1947 comedy "The Farmer'
s Daughter," co-starring Joseph Cotten and Ethel Barrymore, in
which Young played a Swedish farm girl who moves to the big city
to study nursing and gets sidetracked into domestic service,
romance and politics. The part won her the Academy Award for best
actress.
</P>
<P>
Notable film credits also include the 1947 Christmas classic "
The Bishop's Wife" with David Niven and Cary Grant and the 1949
drama "Come to the Stable," which earned Young her second Oscar
nomination for her role as a nun. She lost out to Olivia de
Havilland for her film, "The Heiress."
</P>
<P>
From 1953 to 1963, she appeared on television in more than 300
episodes of "The Loretta Young Show," opening the program with her
much-satirized trademark of sweeping through a doorway, always in
a high-style gown. She was nominated seven times for Emmys as best
starring actress and won three times.
</P>
<P>
"During the series I played every role possible -- Chinese,
Japanese, Swedish, Indian, old, ugly, young, pretty," she said in
a 1973 interview. "It was a marvelous experience for an actress to
do everything she had ever wanted to do. I got it out of my system.
"
</P>
<P>
She retired at the end of "The New Loretta Young Show" in 1963,
devoting her time to charities and a line of beauty products
bearing her name. She returned to acting in 1986, appearing in a
television movie, "Christmas Eve."
</P>
<P>
During her Hollywood heyday, Miss Young appeared opposite most
of the top male stars of her time. They included Lon Chaney,
Ronald Colman, John Barrymore, Clark Gable, James Cagney, Spencer
Tracy, Cary Grant, Charles Boyer, Tyrone Power, David Niven, Joel
McCrea, Robert Mitchum, William Holden and Joseph Cotten.

<HEADLINE> African leaders Optimistic about Summit on Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba believed on Sunday that Monday's summit of warring
parties to the two-year Congolese conflict will put the peace
process back on track in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
.
</P>
<P>
The fact that all heads of state involved in the conflict will
attend the meeting here is an indication that they are ready to
remove the obstacles to the implementation of the Lusaka ceasefire
agreement signed one year ago, said Chiluba, who brokered the
Lusaka agreement and will preside over the summit.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa hoped on arrival
here that the summit will lead to a speedy implementation of the
Lusaka ceasefire agreement.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the deployment of the U.N. peacekeeping forces
in the DRC is important for the successful implementation of the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
However, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe said on arrival
that the war in the DRC is an African problem and can be solved by
Africans themselves.
</P>
<P>
He said that there is no need to involve the United Nations and
the Southern African Development Community (SADC) which called the
summit can solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe expressed his confidence that the summit will promote
peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
The rebel Congolese Liberation Movement (MLC) leader Jean-
pierre Bemba said on arrival here that only dialogue can solve the
problems facing the DRC.
</P>
<P>
He called on DRC President Laurent Kabila to go back to the
negotiation table and work with other warring factions.
</P>
<P>
Bemba is confident of positive result of the summit.
</P>
<P>
The deployment of 5,000 peacekeeping forces and military
observers approved by he U.N. Security Council in February has
been withheld because of the continued fighting in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The conflict has sucked in Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia, which
support DRC President Laurent Kabila, and also Rwanda and Uganda,
which back different rebel groups in the DRC to fight the Kabila
government.
