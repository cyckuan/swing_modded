<HEADLINE> Tax-Cut Proposal Is Political Drama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican-controlled Senate is poised to  
follow the House's lead next week and approve a 10-year, $792 
billion tax cut over Democratic opposition. But it's political 
theater that is unfolding as much as tax-cutting, and GOP leaders 
may wind up courting a veto that President Clinton is ready to 
provide. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Republicans send me a plan that undermines our ability  
to reform Social Security and Medicare and abandons the fiscal 
discipline that has helped fuel our economic growth, I will send it 
straight back with a veto,'' Clinton said in a statement Thursday 
after the House voted. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans cast their plan in far different, politically  
appealing terms. ``We lock away the Social Security surplus so that 
it can be spent only on retirement security,'' said Speaker Dennis 
Hastert, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP tax cut is ``responsible and balanced,'' he added. ``It  
will keep the budget balanced. It will keep the economy growing. 
And it will return power back to the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton favors tax cuts in the range of $250 billion, and  
Republicans fully understand he would veto a measure that reduces 
them by more than three times as much. Many would welcome a veto, 
and the political confrontation it involves, as a way to sharpen 
the differences between the political parties in the run-up to next 
year's elections. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP lawmakers believe he will suffer politically if he rejects  
the measure, said one aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	As a next step, Republicans plan to pass a tax cut through the  
Senate next week. The measure, which emerged from the Senate 
Finance Committee, is the same size as the House bill, but differs 
markedly in detail. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate measure, for example, achieves substantial cuts by  
reducing the tax rate on the bottom bracket from 15 percent to 14 
percent, rather than imposing a 10 percent cut over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	It has none of the capital gains cuts that Texas Rep. Bill  
Archer drafted into the bill that emerged from his House Ways and 
Means Committee and cleared the House. But it raises the amounts 
that individuals could put into the individual retirement accounts. 
Both would ease the so-called marriage penalty, the Senate bill 
more generously. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican aides in both houses say the likeliest plan is to  
attempt to craft a hurried tax cut compromise and clear it through 
both houses before lawmakers leave the Capitol for a summer break 
in early August. 
</P>
<P>
	Keeping to that timetable will be difficult, given the  
differences between the two bills and the hard bargaining that 
inevitably accompanies a measure of the complexity of this one. 
</P>
<P>
	And even if a compromise is struck quickly, the measure wouldn't  
be formally sent to the White House until after Labor Day, to avoid 
handing Clinton the chance to stage a veto ceremony when lawmakers 
are dispersed. Already, staff aides are discussing plans for a 
series of public appearances during the congressional recess in 
August as part of an effort to trumpet the benefits their proposal 
would provide for married couples and others. 
</P>
<P>
	There is a competing GOP strategy, though, which involves  
marking time on a congressional compromise as a way of leaving open 
the possibility of an early deal with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert talked of compromise on Thursday after shepherding the  
bill through the House, although he left the timing vague. ``We've 
got room to work with the president. If we're going to get 
something signed, we're going to have to sit down and work 
something out,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the president wants to do anything at all, as part of his  
legacy, he needs to start getting serious about sitting down to 
talk about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For now, though, the momentum seems to be toward confrontation.

<HEADLINE> Torn Cherokees Voting on New Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAHLEQUAH, Okla. (AP) -- After more than two years of turmoil  
that has torn apart America's second-largest Indian tribe, 
political bickering has given way to potluck suppers and campaign 
videos in the Cherokee Nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomorrow, voters will decide whether to retain incumbent Chief  
Joe Byrd or switch to challenger Chad Smith -- a choice some see as 
pivotal for the 200,000-member tribe. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the most important election in this century,'' said  
former Chief Wilma Mankiller, who supports Smith. ``People want 
change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, Byrd and Smith have mailed promotional videos to  
thousands of Cherokees throughout America and made the rounds 
across eastern Oklahoma. Campaigning last month at the tribe's 
industrial center, Byrd greeted employees, sometimes in Cherokee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I speak the language,'' said Byrd, a 44-year-old, full-blooded  
tribe member. ``I think Cherokee, and he cannot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, 48, a lawyer who is half-Cherokee, has enlisted the help  
of actor Wes Studi, who portrayed the title character in 
``Geronimo'' and a fierce warrior in ``The Last of the Mohicans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Smith's promotional video, Studi spoke from outside the  
tribal courthouse, telling viewers the building is ``a reminder of 
our Cherokee Nation at our very best -- and unfortunately, our worst 
as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About two years ago, Smith was arrested as he tried to stop  
Byrd's administration from closing the building, and a crowd 
clashed on the steps a month later when two rival groups of tribal 
marshals fought over its control. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident was a flash point in a conflict that began months  
before, when Byrd fired marshals who served a search warrant on his 
office for evidence of alleged misspending. 
</P>
<P>
	The firings brought court orders that were ignored, ouster  
attempts and boycotts that have kept the tribe's legislative body 
from meeting regularly for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribal finances have been a key issue in the campaign. Smith  
alleges that Byrd's tenure has seen the tribe slide from a $3.4 
million surplus to a projected $18 million deficit. Byrd 
administration officials say the chief inherited a $1.3 million 
deficit and has since trimmed it to under $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's election among 26,000 registered voters will be  
monitored by officials from the Atlanta-based Carter Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The candidates predict a close finish. Smith says a high turnout  
should favor him, while Byrd is convinced he'll benefit from 
feelings of tribal unity. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've already overcome the Trail of Tears,'' Byrd said.  
``These little squabbles and politics are petty.''

<HEADLINE> Sedaka's Added to Wax Museum </HEADLINE>

<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Celebrities attending the opening of the first  
Madame Tussaud wax museum in the United States found themselves 
seeing double. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a marvelous piece of work. It's uncanny,'' singer  
Neil Sedaka said Thursday as he stood next to his wax figure at the 
$20 million Madame Tussaud's Celebrity Encounter. 
</P>
<P>
	The museum is housed in the $1.5 billion Venetian resort and  
features figures of more than 100 celebrities, including Elton 
John, Cher, Mel Gibson, Babe Ruth and Judy Garland. 
</P>
<P>
	A second museum by the London-based company is under  
construction in New York's Times Square, with opening set for the

<HEADLINE> Pan Am Games Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Shutouts and routs were the order of  
the opening day of the Pan American Games for the United States, 
which also collected six medals in canoe-kayak. 
</P>
<P>
	The soccer squads didn't yield a goal Friday and the men's water  
polo team also was spotless. The women allowed two, but they scored 
16. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have one of the best defenses in the world,'' men's water  
polo defender Craig Kredell said after an 18-0 victory over 
Colombia. ``We showed Colombia and all the competitors in this 
tournament what they can expect from us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brad Schumacher scored four for the Americans.  
</P>
<P>
	The women, making their Pan Am debut, had a sluggish start  
before doing the same in beating Puerto Rico 16-2. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, we should come out a little sharper offensively,'' said  
Courtney Johnson, who had three goals. ``But it's not a bad result 
for one of the early games of the tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hours before the opening ceremony at Winnipeg Stadium, native  
Canadian marchers paraded in protest of what they say are 
third-world conditions for their people in Manitoba. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps 200 marchers, including native drummers, were on hand  
for the start of the walk and then headed to the stadium. They 
promised to remain outside and not disrupt the official opening of 
the games being attended by Princess Anne and other dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not the intention of this demonstration at all, we are  
not protesting the Pan Am Games,'' said organizer Gerald McIvor. 
``My people are living in third-world conditions in the country 
that's been voted No. 1 again in the world as the best country in 
the world to live in. 
</P>
<P>
	On the soccer fields, the U.S. men defeated Cuba 1-0. Pete  
Vagenas got the goal in the 57th minute and Tim Howard stopped six 
shots for the shutout in a rough game marred by seven yellow cards. 
</P>
<P>
	``This Cuba team was very fast, tactically they were very  
strong,'' coach Clive Charles said. ``I am impressed with them and 
very happy to come out with a win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	America's women, represented by the under-20 team, had the  
quickest start imaginable, getting a goal in the first minute from 
Marcia Wallis on the way to a 6-0 romp past Costa Rica. Lauren 
Molinaro scored twice as the United States had a 36-7 shots 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second straight day, Stein Jorgensen of San Diego and  
John Mooney of Eugene, Ore., won gold medals in kayaking. They were 
part of the 1,000-meter four-man squad that won on Thursday and 
captured the kayak 500 doubles Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been training pretty hard working toward this year's  
events and looking ahead to the 2000 Olympics,'' Jorgensen said. 
``It's pretty exciting to have been in two races and to have won 
two gold medals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kathryn Colin of Kailua, Hawaii, got silver in both singles and  
doubles kayak. She finished behind Canada's Karen Furneaux in the 
500 singles and teamed in the 500 doubles with Tamara Jenkins of 
Seattle, also finishing behind host Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	In women's volleyball, Cuba, the heavy favorite, swept the  
United States in three sets.

<HEADLINE> Computer Error Cited in Overcharges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Providian Financial Corp., one of the  
nation's biggest credit card companies, blamed a computer error for 
overcharging thousands of customers, and has set aside $20 million 
for refunds. 
</P>
<P>
	Providian, which specializes in issuing credit cards to people  
other lenders dismiss, said in a statement Thursday that it regrets 
the ``inconvenience to our customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which made $494.7 million from late fees in the  
latest quarter, more than twice as much as in the second quarter of 
1998, admitted to around 700,000 overcharges. 
</P>
<P>
	The admission of error comes after 20 months of customer  
complaints that the company was repeatedly charging late fees for 
bills paid on time, and adding on unauthorized charges for credit 
protection and auto club memberships. 
</P>
<P>
	A dozen lawsuits have been filed against the company, and the  
Oakland Better Business Bureau has received over 850 complaints. As 
of last month, the San Francisco District Attorney's Office was 
also investigating the company. 
</P>
<P>
	In May 1998, the company blamed the post office for the late  
fees, saying customers ``underestimate how long it takes the U.S. 
Postal Service to deliver their payment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Providian now chalks the problem up to a 1997 computer  
programming error that failed to account for three-day weekends and 
holidays, mistakenly charging customers late fees for the extra 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	Providian representatives said they were confident the problem  
had been solved, but Phillip Schuman, an attorney representing 
customers in a class-action lawsuit against the company, said $20 
million will not cover what Providian owes. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite myriad complaints over the last two years, Providian's  
net income more than doubled to $126.5 million in the second 
quarter this year.

<HEADLINE> Naturalist Beheaded in Yosemite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) -- A Yosemite naturalist was  
found beheaded along a stream near her home in a remote part of the 
park, and the FBI was searching a large area for clues Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rangers found the body on Thursday a few hundred yards from the  
park housing she shared with two people who were away on business 
at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	She was found just a few miles from El Portal, the town where  
three sightseers were last seen a month before their bodies were 
found in March. No charges have been filed in those slayings, and 
an FBI task force and federal grand jury investigating that case 
have said they are confident that most of those responsible are 
behind bars on unrelated charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have absolutely no reason to believe there is a  
connection'' between the two cases, said FBI agent James Maddock. 
</P>
<P>
	However, workers at Cedar Lodge, the motel-restaurant where the  
three sightseers were last seen, said Friday that FBI agents were 
asking about a maintenance worker who failed to show up for work. 
The man apparently did not work at the lodge when the three women 
were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities began searching after the woman was reported missing  
by a friend she was supposed to visit in Sausalito, just north of 
San Francisco. The victim's loaded car was found outside her 
quarters, ready for the trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddock said Friday ``a large, very large'' area was being  
carefully searched for clues, and a number of people were being 
questioned. The FBI is assisting in the investigation because the 
park is federal property. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman worked at the Yosemite Institute, a nonprofit group  
that runs education programs through a partnership with the park 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was one of the finest naturalists and science teachers I  
ever met,'' said John Carlstroem, executive director of the 
Headlands Institute, the Yosemite Institute's sister campus, his 
voice choking with emotion. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlstroem, who described her as ``wiry, red-haired and full of  
enthusiasm,'' said she loved children and teaching, especially when 
she was ``connecting young people with nature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are going to be a lot of sad kids when they find out  
she's gone,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Park spokesman Kendell Thompson said the last murder in the park  
he could remember was a dozen years ago, when a husband pushed his 
wife off a cliff. He said such incidents draw so much attention 
precisely because they are so rare, pointing out that the park 
averages about 4 million visitors a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We get one incident in 12 years,'' Suzette Prue, a co-worker  
of the victim, said Friday. ``I feel really safe here.''

<HEADLINE> Moore Tinkers With Colts' Offense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TERRE HAUTE, Ind. (AP) -- Peyton Manning's first season was the  
most productive in NFL history for a rookie quarterback, but that 
isn't stopping offensive coordinator Tom Moore from tinkering 
around as the Indianapolis Colts began training camp practice 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Football is an ongoing thing. The biggest thing you've got to  
do in the offseason is sit back and take a look at what you did, 
where you're going. You've got to stay up with it, so you're not 
playing catch-up,'' said Moore, who in his debut with Indianapolis 
last year saw the offense accumulate 5,116 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the third highest in franchise history and the most by  
the Colts since 1980. Manning accounted for the majority of the 
offense, passing for an NFL rookie record of 3,739 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to add some new things,'' Moore said. ``Last year  
with Peyton we put in a lot of offense. He's very capable of 
handling a lot of offense. He did some very good things. Through 
the course of the year you see some things you can add, or modify, 
and that is what training camp is for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moore said the offense won't change much with the departure of  
three-time Pro Bowl selection Marshall Faulk, the team's leading 
rusher the past five seasons. Faulk accumulated career-highs of 
1,319 yards on the ground and 909 yards on receptions, but was 
traded to St. Louis in anticipation of a holdout this year and the 
drafting of Edgerrin James. 
</P>
<P>
	James, the fourth overall pick in this year's draft, will step  
into Faulk's role once he is signed. 
</P>
<P>
	``From what we've seen in minicamp and summer camp, Edgerrin has  
the capability of catching the ball. We still want to get everybody 
involved in catching the ball, and we're not making any significant 
changes in our running game,'' Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
	But James has to be signed before he can report to camp. Club  
president Bill Polian said Friday that he and agent Leigh Steinberg 
were ``very far apart'' and that he was not ``hopeful anything will 
get done any time soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg did not immediately respond to a telephone message  
seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Once he signs, the 6-foot, 216-pound James is penciled in for  
heavy duty. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got the body and has demonstrated the potential to be a  
back who can produce the big run and also deliver in short yardage 
situations. You like to have a back that can play every down,'' 
Moore said. ``That way you don't get stereotyped or labeled by who 
is in the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Moore says Manning is way ahead of where he was last  
year when he missed the first five days of training camp while his 
contract was being negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
	``The maturity is easy to see, the success he had last year is  
something we'll be able to build on,'' Moore said. ``One of the 
things that really helps Peyton is when you tell him something, 
make a correction of something, you may make it last year and it 
still stuck with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has great retention ... that helps him down the road. He  
sees things with a great visualization. Last year, he was running 
the offense and learning it. This year, he's picking up where he 
left off.''

<HEADLINE> Bishop Admits Consensual Sex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UKIAH, Calif. (AP) -- A day after announcing his resignation, a  
Roman Catholic bishop has admitted to a sexual relationship with a 
former priest who accused him of sexual assault. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bishop did regretfully have a personal consensual  
relationship with Father (Jorge) Hume that was inappropriate for 
both of them as priests,'' Joe Piasta, a lawyer for former Bishop 
G. Patrick Ziemann, said Thursday. ``I can say we would classify it 
as sexual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ziemann resigned Wednesday. He was accused of sexual assault by  
Hume in a complaint filed last Friday in Sonoma County Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Ziemann removed Hume from St. Mary's church in Ukiah in 1996  
after Hume admitted stealing church money. In his complaint, Hume 
alleges that Ziemann forced him to engage in various sex acts and 
demanded sex in exchange for silence about the thefts. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations are false, Piasta said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ziemann, who led the 140,000-member Diocese of Santa Rosa in  
Northern California, said he resigned to fight the lawsuit and to 
prevent damage to the church's reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	Before filing the suit, Hume demanded Ziemann pay him $8 million  
to drop the claims. Hume's lawyer, Irma Cordova, said this was ``to 
get their attention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hume, a Costa Rica native, was recruited in 1992 by Ziemann to  
serve the diocese's Hispanic community. 
</P>
<P>
	Though highly regarded by many, Ziemann's seven-year tenure as  
bishop was marked by sexual scandals since his arrival. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, one of Ziemann's priests was accused of preying on  
teenage boys at a church camp. In ensuing years, four more priests, 
and finally Ziemann himself, became entangled in sex scandals that 
cost the church at least $1.3 million in legal settlements. 
</P>
<P>
	Santa Rosa police said they were investigating Hume's  
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Ziemann is seeking an independent church investigation into the  
allegations, his attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
	Archbishop William Levada of San Francisco will oversee the  
Santa Rosa diocese until a new bishop is appointed.

<HEADLINE> Brewers Release Jim Abbott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The Brewers were supposed to provide a fresh  
start for one-handed pitcher Jim Abbott. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Milwaukee might have been the last stop in his  
inspirational baseball career. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers on Friday released Abbott less than six months after  
signing him to a free-agent contract. Abbott made a surprising 
comeback last season after over a year out of the game, but his 
career hit a low point this season as the 31-year-old had renewed 
struggles with control and confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The team made no formal announcement of the move before  
traveling to Florida to play the Marlins Friday, leading to 
speculation Abbott may be retiring from baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott's former teammates said that wasn't the case, however.  
</P>
<P>
	``He said he's going to take about a week off or so and see if  
there are any opportunities out there where he might be able to 
start,'' Brewers reliever Mike Myers said Friday in Miami. 
``Whatever he does, he'll be fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brewers media relations director Jon Greenberg confirmed the  
release but didn't know if Abbott planned to retire. Abbott's 
agent, Scott Boras, did not return phone messages from The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	He had a 2-8 record and a 6.91 earned-run average when the  
Brewers released him. Milwaukee signed Abbott as a starter, but 
when he failed to produce wins, he was bounced between the rotation 
and the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of it was his call. He wanted to be a starter,'' Myers  
said. ``He didn't think he was well-suited for the bullpen. He 
doesn't need the money just to hang out in the bullpen just to take 
a few mop-up innings here and there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After he allowed five runs in 3 2-3 innings in front of friends  
and family July 8 at Tiger Stadium, he said would contemplate his 
future after the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had talked to him a little bit about it before the All-Star  
break,'' Brewers manager Phil Garner said. ``We had a good 
conversation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His final appearance with the Brewers was one to forget. The  
Philadelphia Phillies shelled him for four hits and three runs in 
the ninth inning of their 7-0 win over Milwaukee on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott also had two walks and two wild pitches, and he left the  
mound to a chorus of boos from the County Stadium crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jimmy is as professional as any player I've been around,''  
Garner said. ``He's a tremendous human being. I'm sure whatever 
he's going to do, he'll be a success at it. If he wants to stay in 
the game, the door is open for him, I'm sure not only with our club 
but with a lot of other clubs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott, who was born without a right hand, was a collegiate star  
at Michigan before coming to national attention with the United 
States team that won the baseball tournament at the 1988 Olympics 
in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent four solid seasons with the California Angels,  
compiling a 47-52 record, before being traded to the New York 
Yankees. He pitched a no-hitter against Cleveland on Sept. 4, 1993, 
at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a thrill of a lifetime,'' Abbott recalled Sunday, the  
day David Cone threw a perfect game for the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott opened the 1995 season with the Chicago White Sox and  
later was traded back to the Angels, who released him after a 
series of shaky starts in spring training in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, he signed a minor league deal with the White Sox and  
worked his way through the farm system. His touch appeared to be 
back as he reached the majors, where he was 5-0 in the final month 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	But the ever-frugal White Sox elected to use younger pitchers in  
their 1999 rotation, and on Jan. 27 Abbott signed a one-year, 
$600,000 contract with the Brewers, who promised him a spot in the 
starting rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't really explain '96,'' Abbott said when the Brewers  
signed him. ``I got off to a bad start and I just didn't pitch with 
confidence. I became awful tentative on the mound and it just 
became a downward spiral, a bad year personally and it was a tough 
year for the Angels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In spring training with Milwaukee, much was made of Abbott's  
experiments with new off-speed pitches. The experiments apparently 
failed; he gave up 18 runs in his first three starts of the year 
and never held a permanent spot in the Brewers' rotation again. 
</P>
<P>
	``Abbie hasn't pitched that poorly for us,'' Garner said last  
week. ``He's a guy that's had a lot of bad luck. This was supposed 
to be the year he broke through and got back to being the pitcher 
we know he is. He's thrown well, but sometimes that's not enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Right-handed reliever Reggie Harris was recalled by the Brewers  
from Triple-A Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Abbott) knows what having to overcome obstacles is all  
about,'' Garner said. ``He's been at the top of the heap and the 
bottom of the heap.''

<HEADLINE> Bears' Matthews Gets His Chance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLATTEVILLE, Wis. (AP) -- When the Chicago Bears decided to cut  
Erik Kramer loose two days before training camp, part of their 
reason was a young quarterback who set all kinds of records at a 
big-time, pass-happy school. 
</P>
<P>
	No, not Cade McNown, though that's a good guess. Try Shane  
Matthews. 
</P>
<P>
	OK, so you might need an NFL register to remember who he is. But  
the Bears have enough confidence in him that they let Kramer go 
before they had a deal with McNown. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shane can win games for us,'' said quarterbacks coach John  
Shoop, who worked with Matthews the past two years at Carolina. 
``It's been said time and again that he's a super-smart guy. He is, 
but it's more than that. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an accurate passer, he's got great mechanics and he does  
get us in and out of the right plays and handles the protections 
appropriately. Physically, he can do everything we ask him to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's a good thing being the Bears began two-a-days Friday with  
McNown still nowhere to be found. He and his agent, Tom Condon, 
want a deal with voidable years, which would allow him to void the 
last two or three years of a long-term contract. Chicago doesn't 
think that's such a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it'll be several days before anything gets worked  
out,'' said Ted Phillips, the Bears' president and chief executive 
officer. ``But I'm confident it will get done. Tom Condon is a pro, 
he knows how important it is to have Cade in here. We do, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears have taken a lot of grief in the last few days over  
the timing of Kramer's release. By letting him go before they 
signed McNown, the 12th overall pick in the draft, they seemed to 
give the rookie the advantage in negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	The other three quarterbacks on the roster -- Matthews, Jim  
Miller and Moses Moreno -- have just two NFL starts among them. So 
if the Bears want McNown to be their guy, well, they're going to 
have to give him what he wants, right? 
</P>
<P>
	Wrong, Phillips said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I understand the perceived leverage, but the reality is, the  
coaches feel comfortable with who we have,'' he said. ``If they're 
comfortable with who we have besides Cade, then I don't see the 
extra leverage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Which is where Matthews comes in. He's had one of those  
hard-luck careers where he does well in training camp only to be 
cut at the end. There never seems to be enough room for him, and 
when there is -- like the last two years at Carolina -- there isn't 
any playing time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe in my abilities and there are people out there who  
know I can play,'' he said. ``This whole game is about having an 
opportunity. I've never been given that chance and I'm very 
thankful to get it now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matthews isn't exactly some rent-a-quarterback. He played at  
Florida in Steve Spurrier's Fun `N' Gun system, setting 50 Gator 
records and 19 SEC marks. He led the Gators to SEC championships in 
1990 and 1991, and finished fifth in voting for the Heisman Trophy 
as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, during his third stint with the Bears, Matthews only  
got to play in two games. He didn't throw a pass in the first, but 
in the second he went 13-of-17 for 158 yards and a touchdown. He 
also ran for another score. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's made himself into a lot better quarterback than I think  
he was even two years ago when I first got him at Carolina,'' Shoop 
said. ``What did (UCLA coach John) Wooden say? Success is when 
preparation meets opportunity. He's got an opportunity and he's 
prepared for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It helps that the Bears new, multiple-option offense suits  
Matthews. It's similar to what he ran at Florida, and new coach 
Dick Jauron said Matthews is a little ahead of the other 
quarterbacks. He may not be as mobile as McNown, but Shoop said he 
makes good decisions and is incredibly accurate. 
</P>
<P>
	He's also smart enough to know this isn't a long-term position.  
The Bears have made no secret that McNown is their future, 
regardless of when he gets to training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to compete as hard as I can,'' Matthews said. ``But  
you don't draft a guy in the first round to let him sit around, and 
I'm going to do what I can to help him.''

<HEADLINE> Coke Sees Probe As Routine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Always Coca-Cola may be the beverage king's way  
of telling consumers that its signature products are the anytime, 
anywhere refreshments of choice. 
</P>
<P>
	But these days -- amid a global economic downturn, a  
contamination scare in France and Belgium and, now a new European 
antitrust inquiry-- the slogan might refer to the company always 
being under the gun. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola's Chairman M. Douglas Ivester insisted Thursday the  
company's recovery from a European health scare is on track. And he 
downplayed charges by European regulators that the soft-drink 
makers tried to bully competitors out of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	At a meeting of securities analysts in New York, Ivester  
detailed the company's aggressive new European marketing campaign 
aimed at overcoming the recent blow it took when hundreds of people 
complained of feeling sick after drinking Coke products produced in 
Belgium and France. 
</P>
<P>
	He described as routine reports or raids over the past two days  
at Coke offices in Britain, Germany, Austria and Denmark in which 
European Union antitrust investigators seized documents. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not something I am very exercised about,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our brand is strong,'' Ivester said. ``Nothing in the past 12  
months has altered our long-term view (of profit growth).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ivester said the company is cooperating with the probe and noted  
that the EU has reviewed the antitrust practices of a number of big 
corporations in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	William Pecoriello, an analyst with Sanford Bernstein, said Coke  
still faces obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one more piece of information that investors can worry  
about,'' he said. ``It's one more uncertainly, but right now we're 
not overly concerned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The EU antitrust investigation is just the latest setback for  
Coke, which acknowledges the last 12 months have been challenging. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke last week reported that second-quarter earnings dropped 21  
percent, largely as a result of the contamination scare and the 
lingering economic downturn across Asia and Latin America. 
Additionally, regulators have held up Coke's efforts to buy French 
beverage maker Orangina and most of Cadbury Schweppes' brands 
overseas. In addition, four current and past black employees have 
sued the company for racial discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke executives seem most concerned with the economic troubles  
around the world, which have hurt sales. Executives said Thursday 
they were confident about a global economic recovery, although they 
acknowledged it will be gradual. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivester accused the news media of overblowing the health risks  
of the European contamination, saying many of those who reported 
illnesses hadn't consumed any Coke products. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Coke has spent millions trying to build back its  
business in France and Belgium, following the biggest recall of its 
products in history. 
</P>
<P>
	After destroying millions of dollars of Coke, the company is  
giving away a free Coke to every Belgian. 
</P>
<P>
	It is also buying TV and print ads which feature Ivester  
apologizing. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is doing a massive sampling campaign, including 500  
hostesses who are giving away beverages in local supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
	So far the efforts appear to be working. Coke officials say they  
are having trouble keeping up with demand. 
</P>
<P>
	European Union Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert said  
Thursday that in addition to raids at Coke offices, investigators 
also seized records from three Coca-Cola bottling partners in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators were seeking evidence that Coca-Cola exploited its  
market dominance by offering retailers rebates to shut out 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke, and its Sprite and Fanta products account for about half  
of the soft-drink market in Europe, with PepsiCo a distant second. 
</P>
<P>
	``A dominant company on any market cannot indirectly bully  
competitors by pushing its customers to buy less of the 
competitors' products,'' Van Miert said. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief director of Coca-Cola Nordic beverages, Svend Ivan  
Petersen, said the company has done nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Miert did not say whether the EU had acted on complaints  
from one of Coke's competitors or from disgruntled retailers 
</P>
<P>
	If regulators decide to launch a full-scale investigation, it  
would likely last at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke's position as the world's biggest soft drink supplier has  
already brought it into conflict with European regulators. Italy 
has its own investigation under way into whether Coca-Cola violated 
its competition laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Miert, the outgoing EU competition commissioner, has raised  
the profile of his antitrust regulators in a series of cases in 
recent years, including the imposition of conditions on Boeing's 
$15 billion takeover of McDonnell Douglas in 1997, and the handing 
down a record $106 million fine against Volkswagen last year for 
restrictive sales practices. Last week, the commission fined 
British Airways PLC $7 million for rebates to travel agents who 
increased the airline's ticket sales at the expense of competitors.

	Kennedy Relatives Prepare for Mass  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A day after the ashes of John Kennedy Jr. and  
Carolyn Bessette Kennedy were committed to the sea, relatives are 
preparing for a quiet Mass today to celebrate the young couple. An 
invitation-only group of about 350 people, including President 
Clinton and the first lady, is expected today at the Church of St. 
Thomas More in Manhattan. The 126-year-old church is where 
Kennedy's mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, worshipped. The 
privacy of the occasion -- and of the service aboard a Navy 
destroyer when the ashes of Kennedy, his wife and sister-in-law 
Lauren Bessette were given to the sea -- contrasts with the public 
Mass held by New York's Irish community yesterday.

most powerful X-ray telescope safely into orbit today despite an 
electrical problem on the way. Seven hours after their 
stress-filled launch, Air Force Col. Eileen Collins and her crew 
accomplished the main objective of their mission: ejecting the $1.5 
billion Chandra X-ray Observatory from the shuttle. The 45-foot 
telescope, which weighs 50,000 pounds with its rocket motor and 
support gear, is the heaviest payload ever hauled by a space

	Aide: Barak To Ask For Wye Changes

	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Prime Minister Ehud Barak will ask for changes  
in the interim Wye River peace agreement when he meets with 
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat tomorrow, Barak's top security 
adviser said today. Under Wye, Israel was to withdraw from 13.1 
percent of the West Bank in three stages between November 1998 and 
January 1999. Barak would like to fold parts of Wye into 
negotiations on a final peace agreement. But a senior Arafat 
adviser said today that the Palestinians will insist on a full 
implementation of the agreement. The Palestinians want to control 
as much West Bank land as possible before heading into so-called 
final status negotiations.

	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- NATO and Russia renewed their  
cooperation today in the aftermath of the Kosovo crisis that 
divided them, jointly urging Serbs not to flee the 
Albanian-dominated province. The meeting of NATO ambassadors and 
Russian diplomats who sit on the Permanent Joint Council had been 
set for Tuesday, but was delayed until the agenda could be 
clarified and a joint statement drafted. The Russian news agency 
Itar-Tass said the talks today were limited to Kosovo. Russia froze 
relations with NATO after the alliance bombed Yugoslavia for 11 
weeks, ignoring Russian protests.

banned yesterday, highlighting official fears that it could 
threaten communist power by becoming a rallying point for anger 
over unemployment and corruption. Police took away about 15 people 
today who stood quietly outside the compound where President Jiang 
Zemin and other leaders live. About 100 people were detained in 
nearby Beihai park, sitting quietly on the ground surrounded by 
police.

<HEADLINE> Russian PM, Gore To Talk Nukes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore intends to set a  
schedule with Russian Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin next week for 
further reductions in nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gore's foreign policy assistant, Leon Fuerth, said the  
one-day visit by Stepashin was unlikely to produce any major 
agreements. ``We have to get warmed up with a brand new 
government,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stepashin will meet President Clinton on Tuesday after two  
sessions with Gore on trade, science, space and other topics that 
are the business of their joint commission on economic and 
technological cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Thursday authorized Stepashin  
to discuss new reductions in nuclear arms with the United States 
while the Russian parliament declines to act on the 1993 START II 
treaty, which called for deep cuts on both sides' long-range 
nuclear warheads to 3,000 to 3,500 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, at a meeting with Yeltsin in Germany last month, got a  
green light for U.S. development of anti-missile defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty prohibits a nationwide  
defense system on the theory that deters nuclear attack because the 
retaliation would be devastating. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia and many arms control supporters in the United States  
consider the treaty a bedrock of arms control. But Fuerth said, 
``We both realize there is an evolving threat to both of our 
countries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On his way here, Stepashin plans to stop in Seattle to take a  
close look at major American corporations. He also hopes to pocket 
a large loan from the International Monetary Fund, but a decision 
is not expected until later in the week. 
</P>
<P>
	With Russia's economy lagging, the IMF appears ready to approve  
$4.5 billion in new loans, beginning with an initial $630 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are reasonably optimistic,'' Fuerth said at a news  
conference Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Total foreign investment in Russia was $1.5 billion in  
January-March, down from $2.5 billion in the corresponding period 
last year. Direct investment totaled $600 million, down 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said in early July that  
Russia was meeting conditions laid down by the IMF. An IMF 
delegation had gone to Moscow and praised Russia's latest economic 
moves. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian parliament has approved fiscal consolidation, tax  
laws and changes in the banking system. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlos Pascual, who heads the Russia desk at the National  
Security Council, said Friday that a U.S. delegation would go to 
Russia later in the summer to evaluate the harvest and any needs 
for food aid. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S.-Russian relations are on the rebound from disagreement over  
the war in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia objected to the NATO bombardment of Yugoslavia but helped  
arrange a settlement that removed all Serb troops and special 
police from the province. Russian troops are serving as 
peacekeepers along with NATO troops from the United States and 
Europe.

<HEADLINE> NHL Hires Mike Murphy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Mike Murphy, a former coach with the Toronto  
Maple Leafs and recently assistant with the Ottawa Senators, was 
named Friday as the NHL's vice president in charge of hockey 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to a new venture in my life, a new field  
of work,'' Murphy said from his home in Aurora, Ontario, north of 
Toronto. ``I hope I can apply some of the experiences I've had as a 
player and as a coach and try to make the league, in any little way 
I can, better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overseeing existing and altered rules, and maintaining lines of  
communication between the league offices and team general managers 
and coaches, will be big parts of the job, Murphy said. As well, 
he'll be an ambassador to other leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NHL wants to establish a stronger relationship with the  
junior leagues, the NCAA and the minor leagues,'' Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll answer only to commissioner Gary Bettman, and to hockey  
operations chiefs Colin Campbell and Jim Gregory. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy, 48, resigned from his assistant coaching job with the  
Senators last weekend. He was head coach of the Maple Leafs in 
1996-97 and 1997-98. He also was on the coaching staffs of the Los 
Angeles Kings, the Vancouver Canucks and the New York Rangers after 
a playing career from 1971-1983 with the St. Louis Blues, the 
Rangers, and the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll miss the action at ice level,'' he said. ``I probably am  
not going to miss the losses. In the new job, I'm sure there will 
be feelings of satisfaction of doing something that might go 
unnoticed but helps the teams and the league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sport is in great shape and the talent level has never been  
higher, Murphy contended. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some areas I hope to lend an opinion on, though,''  
he added. ``I think we can speed the game up, and improve some of 
the playing conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy has a hockey school commitment for the next two weeks,  
then he'll devote all his energies to learning to be a league 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a while, I'm going to feel my way around. I'll try not to  
put my shoe in my mouth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy has always been candid, but hasn't burned bridges. He's  
respected for his honesty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's anybody out there lined up against me. I  
hope there isn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He needn't worry on that count.  
</P>
<P>
	``Mike brings a wealth of NHL experience as a player, coach and  
administrator that few can match,'' Campbell said in a news 
release. ``The addition of someone with Mike's credentials will be 
invaluable as the league continues to grow. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know Ottawa will miss Mike, but we are grateful that he is  
able to join us at the league office.''

<HEADLINE> Tyson Exec's Conviction Reinstated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a small victory for Independent Counsel  
Donald Smaltz, a federal appeals court reinstated the conviction of 
a Tyson Foods executive accused of providing illegal gifts to 
former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's 2-1 ruling sends the case of Archie Schaffer III case  
back to the lower court for sentencing on charges he violated the 
Meat Inspection Act. A lower court had overturned the jury's guilty 
verdict last June on two counts, violations of the Meat Inspection 
Act and the federal gratuity statute. The appeals court left alone 
the gratuity acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Meat Inspection Act, a charge that has a mandatory one year  
sentence, prohibits giving ``money or other thing of value, with 
intent to influence'' to a government official. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we agree with the district court's determination that  
the evidence cannot support a conviction for giving an unlawful 
gratuity, we find sufficient evidence in the record from which a 
reasonable juror could have concluded that Schaffer violated the 
Meat Inspection Act,'' the court wrote in the 26-page decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling is a minor boost for prosecutor Smaltz, who  
unsuccessfully prosecuted Espy for accepting gifts from Tyson and 
other companies regulated by the Agriculture Department. A federal 
jury in December acquitted Espy of all charges. 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Schaffer said, ``I remain absolutely convinced  
that I am innocent of any offense. ... This matter has been long, 
drawn-out and difficult for a lot of people. I believe we will 
prevail in the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We will pursue all further remedies available through the  
judicial system,'' said William H. Jeffress Jr., Schaffer's 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Reaffirming that, Tyson Foods said in a statement: ``Archie is  
and will continue to be a valued team member. ... We remain totally 
convinced of his innocence and will continue to support him in his 
pursuit of legal remedies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a dissenting opinion, U.S. Circuit Judge Karen LeCraft  
Henderson wrote: ``I believe, like the district court, that the 
government failed to adduce evidence to support a finding of intent 
to influence discharge of a specific duty under the Meat Inspection 
Act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge James Robertson overturned Schaffer's  
convictions in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Schaffer, a company spokesman and governmental affairs director,  
was convicted of providing illegal gifts to Espy on two occasions: 
in January 1993, at President Clinton's inaugural dinner; and in 
May 1993, at a birthday party for company chairman Don Tyson in 
Russellville, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	In his ruling, Robertson noted that Schaffer was indicted for  
trying to influence two proposed rules under the Meat Inspection 
Act. But the judge found ``no evidence that Mr. Schaffer or anybody 
in Tyson Foods knew of or anticipated anything about'' the proposed 
policy changes at the time of the events. 
</P>
<P>
	He also noted that once the policy changes were announced, there  
was no evidence that ``Mr. Schaffer or Tyson Foods had any 
objection or opposition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Tyson executive, lobbyist Jack Williams, was tried with  
Schaffer last year and convicted of lying to investigators. He has 
withdrawn his appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson Foods, based in Springdale, Ark., the nation's largest  
poultry producer, was just one company involved in the 
investigation of Espy. Prosecutors have said the company spent 
about $12,000 on Espy and his then-girlfriend, including tickets 
and air fare to a Dallas Cowboys football game and limousine rides.

<HEADLINE> Yosemite Naturalist Found Beheaded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) -- A Yosemite naturalist was  
found beheaded near her home in a remote area of the park, and the 
FBI is investigating the killing, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Joie Ruth Armstrong, 26, was found Thursday near a stream. She  
was last seen alive Wednesday afternoon, when she left her office 
at the Yosemite Institute in Yosemite Valley, park spokesman 
Kendell Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman had planned to make the long drive to Sausalito, just  
north of San Francisco, to visit a friend. The friend reported her 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Rangers found the body Thursday near living quarters Ms.  
Armstrong shared with a man and a woman at employee housing units 
outside a park campground. Her roommates were away on business, 
Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI is assisting in the investigation because the park is  
federal property, agent Nick Rossi said. 
</P>
<P>
	The area where the naturalist was found on the west side of the  
park is relatively unknown to tourists. It's just a few miles away 
from El Portal, the town where three Yosemite sightseers were last 
seen alive in February before their bodies were found about a month 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	No charges have been filed in the slayings of Eureka residents  
Carole Sund and her daughter, Juli, and their family friend, 
Silvina Pelosso from Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
	An FBI task force and federal grand jury investigating the case  
have said they are confident that most of those responsible are 
behind bars on unrelated charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yosemite Institute is a nonprofit group that runs education  
programs through a partnership with the park service.

<HEADLINE> Storm Damages Tiger Stadium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Two panels on the facing of the main press box at  
87-year-old Tiger Stadium were ripped away during a late afternoon 
thunderstorm Friday, delaying the start of Detroit's game against 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was injured when the aluminum-covered plywood panels,  
each approximately 20 square yards, landed in unoccupied seating 
areas below the press box. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm, carrying winds gusting up to 66 mph, came through  
about 4:15 p.m. EDT, 45 minutes before the gates were scheduled to 
open for the 7:05 p.m. game. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident exposed steel along the third deck. The press box  
at Tiger Stadium is one of the highest in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	The seating areas below the damage were sealed off by police  
tape, and persons ticketed to sit there were moved to other areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Other panels that loosened but did not fall had to be removed  
before the game could start. Tom Folk, executive director of 
stadium operations, said a crane had to be brought in to take away 
those panels. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing leads me to believe anything else will happen, but  
we're not going to take that chance,'' Folk said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tigers spokesman Tyler Barnes said approximately 35,000 fans  
were expected Friday night. There was a postgame fireworks display 
scheduled, and Friday was also the first game of a weekend-long 
celebration reuniting the Tigers' 1984 World Series champions. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the final scheduled season for Tiger Stadium, which was  
built in 1912. The Tigers are slated to move next year to Comerica 
Park, currently under construction about a mile east of the old 
ballpark.

<HEADLINE> Pepsi Makes Complaint Vs. Coca-Cola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Coca-Cola can thank its No. 1 rival, PepsiCo, for  
the soft-drink giant's latest troubles in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Pepsi officials acknowledged Friday that they filed the  
complaint that prompted a European Union investigation of charges 
that Coke is illegally trying to bully competitors out of the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	EU investigators raided Coke offices in Britain, Germany,  
Austria and Denmark this week in a search for evidence. The raids 
came a month after Coke's image took a beating from a contamination 
scare in Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	Pepsi refrained from attacking Coke over the Belgian scare. But  
analysts say the No. 2 soft-drink maker's unfair practices 
complaint is part of an effort to distract Coke with legal and 
regulatory hassles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pepsi has done this before and obviously if they can throw  
Coke off stride, distract them or in any way cause them disruption 
competitively, it will be worth it,'' said Martin Romm, an analyst 
for Credit Suisse First Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, this is all competitive posturing on their part,''  
Romm said. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Union suspects Coke may have offered rebates to  
retailers to shut out competition in markets the Atlanta-based 
company already dominates. 
</P>
<P>
	Pepsi said it first complained to European regulators about  
Coke's business practices last year and formally filed its 
complaint June 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did file a complaint with the commission regarding trade  
practices by the Coca-Cola system,'' Pepsi spokesman Richard 
Detwiler said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why Pepsi filed the complaint, Detwiler said only that  
``we have a very strong interest in fair and lawful competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola on Friday again denied wrongdoing while declining  
comment on Pepsi's action. 
</P>
<P>
	``We definitely believe we're within full compliance of all  
competition laws and regulations,'' said Coke spokesman Ben 
Deutsch. ``We believe that the investigation as it continues will 
prove that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, Coke fell 1.4  
percent, or by 87 1/2 cents, to $61.25 a share, while PepsiCo was off 
43 3/4 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $39.37 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	During a June health scare, fears of contamination and  
complaints of illness by hundreds of consumers led Belgium, France, 
Luxembourg and the Netherlands to ban Coca-Cola products for more 
than a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the bans were lifted, Coke had less than a month to  
breathe before Pepsi's complaint caused European investigators this 
week to comb through files at Coke offices. 
</P>
<P>
	If a full-blown investigation of Coke's trade practices in  
Europe is pursued by regulators, it could take a year. Companies 
found guilty of violating EU competition rules could face fines of 
up to 10 percent of their revenue, although fines have been smaller 
in practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the commission fined British Airways more than $7  
million for offering unfair perks to travel agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say Pepsi is trying to increase its market share in  
European countries where its products sell a distant second to 
Coke's. 
</P>
<P>
	In Germany, Denmark and Austria, Coke controls between 43  
percent and 57 percent of the market. Pepsi's share is between 5 
percent and 9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	It isn't the first time Pepsi has turned to legal and regulatory  
powers to gain leverage against Coke. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, PepsiCo Inc., based in Purchase, N.Y., filed suit in  
federal court in New York accusing Coca-Cola Co. of violating 
antitrust laws by cornering the market for fountain drinks sold 
through U.S. theaters, restaurants and stadiums. The suit is 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke has said Pepsi hurt its own fountain sales because it  
failed to aggressively court chains years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Pepsi was also involved in trying to block Coke's beleaguered  
efforts to buy Cadbury Schweppes brands in Australia and to buy 
Orangina, the most popular soft drink in France, said John Sicher, 
editor and publisher of Beverage Digest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pepsi has stepped up its legal efforts against Coke in a  
number of markets,'' Sicher said. ``What's happening right now (in 
Europe) is not just one isolated circumstance.''

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Visits Library </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANTON, Ohio (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton ran into Frances  
Folsom Cleveland on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh hello, Frances,'' Mrs. Clinton said when greeted by a  
volunteer at the National First Ladies' Library who was portraying 
the wife of President Grover Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see your picture every day. I walk by it on the ground  
floor,'' Mrs. Clinton said, referring to a portrait in the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton visited the library, which opened last year in the  
Victorian home of first lady Ida Saxton McKinley, as part of a 
project to preserve national historic places. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is really remarkable,'' Mrs. Clinton said as she looked  
at the renovated foyer of the house. 
</P>
<P>
	She later spoke to a crowd of about 300 people who turned out to  
celebrate the donation of a 19th century bank building that will 
serve as the library's education and research arm following a $3.5 
million renovation. 
</P>
<P>
	The library, about 60 miles south of Cleveland, now mainly  
functions as an online bibliography database of materials written 
about first ladies. The research center will have a place for 
lectures and more library space. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Regula, wife of former Republican Rep. Ralph Regula of  
Canton, founded the library because there wasn't enough material 
available for studying first ladies. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's visit was part of the White House Millennium  
Council's Save America's Treasures initiative, which highlights 
historic sites to encourage preservation of the nation's culture 
and heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to make the First Ladies' Library at least as famous  
as the football hall of fame,'' said Kathryn O'Leary Higgins, a 
vice president for the National Trust for Historic Preservation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pro Football Hall of Fame, Canton's other major landmark,  
sits about a mile away.

<HEADLINE> Seniors Aim for Computer Literacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. has set its sights on  
the largely untapped market of senior citizens, a strategy fully 
endorsed by West Virginia's technology-promoting, 76-year-old 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Cecil Underwood announced Thursday that West Virginia will  
become the first state to tie into Microsoft's Internet training 
program for senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	``Someone described this program as technology where you'd least  
expect it -- in senior centers in West Virginia,'' said Underwood, 
the nation's oldest governor who campaigned on a pledge to use 
technology to make government more efficient. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood said he hopes his peers will develop skills for the  
information age and broaden their horizons. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent U.S. Commerce Department study shows Internet access is  
lowest in rural states like West Virginia. And while 50 percent of 
Americans own computers, only 24 percent of seniors do, according 
to Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	West Virginia, which has the nation's highest median age, also  
ranks low in Internet use and in the percentage of households with 
a computer. 
</P>
<P>
	The state estimates up to 2,000 seniors will become computer  
literate through the program in its first year alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft chose to work with West Virginia instead of retirement  
havens such as Florida or Arizona because Underwood ``really wanted 
to put the resources behind it, and he's really the first governor 
to recognize the importance of technology to seniors,'' said Craig 
Spiezle, director of the Microsoft Senior Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	Spiezle came up with the idea for the program about four years  
ago after his parents ``gave me every reason in the world why they 
didn't need a computer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We as a society make assumptions about seniors and after a  
while they start to believe that stuff, that they can't learn,'' 
Spiezle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft paid $125,000 for 40 computers, software and  
consulting for the West Virginia program. Nine seniors, trained at 
Marshall University's Technology Institute, will teach their peers 
at four regional computer labs. 
</P>
<P>
	One teacher, 70-year-old Elouise Lowther, said she expects the  
program to succeed in part because seniors will be taught by people 
their own age. 
</P>
<P>
	``They hear people talk about icons and the mouse and they don't  
know what that's all about,'' she said. ``But it's all very simple, 
and if they have one of their peers sit down with them and show 
them, I don't think they'll be that intimidated.''

<HEADLINE> Missing Wash. Plane Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PUYALLUP, Wash. (AP) -- There are no reporters camped outside the  
command post, no calls of concern from the president. 
</P>
<P>
	But for relatives of two men whose small plane vanished last  
weekend in the Cascade Range, it barely matters that the world 
isn't watching with the same intensity that attended the search for 
John F. Kennedy Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	They are caught in their own private anguish, clinging to hopes  
that grow more elusive each day. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilot Dennis Waldock, 57, and passenger Leo Walsh, 74,  
disappeared Saturday as they flew toward a cloudy mountain pass 50 
miles east of Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	By Thursday night, not a trace of the missing plane had been  
found. 
</P>
<P>
	``You wake up in the morning, half asleep, and you try to think  
about where they would have gone,'' Leo Walsh Jr. said Thursday 
morning as he waited for clouds to lift so the search for his 
father could resume. ``I've stared a hole through every map of 
western Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Every year, hundreds of small planes crash in the United States.  
Last year alone, 598 people died in general aviation accidents, 
according to federal aviation officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Few crashes attract as much public concern or government  
resources as the search for JFK Jr.'s plane, which plunged into the 
ocean off Martha's Vineyard last Friday night. That effort, covered 
live for days by TV networks, involved hundreds of searchers and 
dozens of aircraft, boats, Navy divers and underwater cameras -- 
even after it became obvious the mission had changed from rescuing 
survivors to recovering wreckage and bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	The search for Waldock and Walsh, meanwhile, has proceeded more  
typically. No one here questions the dedication of the mostly 
volunteer search-and-rescue teams. But there is also tacit 
recognition that not every resource will be available, nor will the 
search go on indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	F.E. ``Mac'' MacSpadden, coordinator of the air search for  
Waldock and Walsh, insists that celebrity or lack thereof is not a 
factor in how a search is conducted. 
</P>
<P>
	Each day, about 20 airplanes piloted by volunteers have taken to  
the air, covering more than 4,340 square miles by Thursday night. 
Any more search planes would just get in the way, MacSpadden said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd do the same for Kennedy as I'd do for this guy,'' he said.  
``As long as I've got some hope here, we'll continue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pressed for what that meant, however, MacSpadden said the  
weekend would bring a good turnout of volunteer pilots. ``If we 
don't find anything, we'll continue until Sunday,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy fog grounded search aircraft this morning, but MacSpadden  
said the skies could clear later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	The search made front-page news in Anchorage, Alaska, where both  
men are prominent in the business community, Waldock as a 
stockbroker, Walsh as a retired construction contractor and 
developer. Here in western Washington, however, newspapers paid far 
more attention to the East Coast search for Kennedy, relegating the 
search in their own backyard to brief stories on inside pages. 
</P>
<P>
	The men vanished Saturday as they flew west across the Cascade  
Range in a Cessna 337 that Waldock had just bought in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Around noon, as the plane approached the Cascade Range, Waldock  
canceled his instrument-flight plan. In a decision that still 
puzzles search officials, Waldock chose to fly by visual cues, 
plunging into dense clouds filling Snoqualmie Pass. Witnesses 
reported seeing the Cessna 337 roaring through the foggy pass, 
hugging the highway. 
</P>
<P>
	By Saturday evening, Waldock's mother, waiting for him in the  
southwestern Washington town of Chehalis, reported him overdue. 
Search planes took to the air the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
	While Walsh's family gathered in Anchorage and Waldock's family  
kept a vigil in Chehalis, two of Walsh's sons joined the search. 
Leo, a Catholic priest in Eagle River, Alaska, and Steve, a 
construction contractor in Anchorage, have gone up each day in 
planes as observers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting in the search-and-rescue command center at the Pierce  
County airport in Puyallup, the brothers -- both pilots -- had only 
praise for the searchers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything we've asked them to do, it turns out they've already  
done it,'' Leo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Their own challenge is to stay upbeat, even when there is no  
good news. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to compartmentalize things,'' said Steve, 44.  
``You've got to shut that (emotional) part down and concentrate on

<HEADLINE> Dreams Galore Favored in CCA Oaks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Having dodged the ``Bullet,'' chances are  
excellent Dreams Galore will prevail when she meets eight other 
3-year-old fillies in Saturday's Coaching Club American Oaks at 
Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Dreams Galore, who will be ridden by Jerry Bailey, is the 1-5  
early favorite in the 1 1/2-mile Oaks. On a Soapbox is the second 
choice at 10-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Her June 26 victory in the 1 1/8-mile Mother Goose at Belmont  
snapped a three-race losing streak, which began when she finished 
third in the Fantasy, won by Excellent Meeting at Oaklawn Park. She 
then finished second to Excellent Meeting's stablemate, 
Silverbulletday, in both the Kentucky Oaks at Churchill Downs and 
the Black-Eyed Susan at Pimlico. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the loss in the Fantasy, Dreams Galore, ridden by Robby  
Albarado, won the Honeybee at Oaklawn. 
</P>
<P>
	On a Soapbox will be starting for only the third time this year.  
She finished third in the Davonna Dale, won by Silverbulletday on 
Feb. 20 at the Fair Grounds. Dream's Galore was fourth in that 
race. On June 25, the filly won a 1 1-16-mile allowance race. 
</P>
<P>
	Making her U.S. debut in the $350,000 CCA Oaks will be  
Irish-bred Gracious Plenty, who finished fifth in a 1 1/2-mile grass 
stakes June 17 at Ascot in England. Her only win in five career 
starts came in her only race off the grass, a 1 1/4-mile maiden stakes 
on an all-weather track April 1 at Lingfield, England. 
</P>
<P>
	She will be ridden by John Velazquez.  
</P>
<P>
	Completing the field are Free Vacation, Strolling Belle,  
Synchronized, Queen's Word, Denver Zephyr and Undermine. Each 
starter will carry 121 pounds.

<HEADLINE> Redskins Move Casserly Aside </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- When the coach and general manager aren't on  
speaking terms, something has got to be done. On Friday, the 
Washington Redskins kept the coach and kicked the GM out of his 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest shakeup under new owner Daniel Snyder, Charley  
Casserly was forced out as general manager and given a new title as 
``consultant to the owner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vinny Cerrato, formerly of the San Francisco 49ers, was given  
Casserly's job under the title of director of player personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was wooing NFL owners to approve his $800 million  
purchase of the Redskins, Snyder vowed to retain Casserly as 
general manager. However, after his first meeting with Casserly and 
coach Norv Turner, Snyder recognized the soured relationship 
between the two and decided he had to renege on his promise. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tension around the football team was just not workable,''  
a team source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``When you 
have the two leaders of the team not speaking to each other, 
something's got to be done about it. There's no way Snyder could 
have known that until he got into the building.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Casserly wouldn't comment on his relationship with Turner, and  
said he realized early on that Snyder would want to make some 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was time to say goodbye to the Redskins in this job and  
move on,'' Casserly said. ``I'm from another era, and another 
group. There's a point you need to get on with your life. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important the owner have his own man in this position.  
He's had a standing offer of resignation from me for some time. He 
asked me to stay through training camp, and I agreed. And he asked 
me to stay on as a consultant, and I agreed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder has been quick to make an impact since he closed the  
purchase of the team earlier this month. Although he had earlier 
promised to retain everyone who worked for the Redskins, last week 
he fired 25 employees -- including secretaries and most of the 
public relations staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Casserly will remain general manager through Sept. 3. He said  
his consultant's role was not yet clearly defined, but that he 
would be an outside ``helping hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder was unavailable for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Casserly started with the Redskins as an unpaid intern in 1977.  
He worked his way through the ranks and became general manager in 
1989. He had been under contract through the 2001 season, but that 
deal will be replaced by a settlement described by Casserly as ``in 
excess'' of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The Redskins won their third Super Bowl after the 1991 season,  
but haven't made the playoffs since 1992. The team has a poor 
record with recent first-round draft picks -- including flops such 
as Heath Shuler, Andre Johnson and Bobby Wilson -- but some of the 
selections were made as much by Turner as Casserly. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Casserly had a masterful draft. He not only got the  
player the Redskins wanted -- Champ Bailey -- but worked the phones 
and ended up with three first-round draft picks for next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner said he would comment at a later date.  
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't had a chance to visit with everybody,'' he said.  
``I'm excited to start training camp and ready to coach this 
football team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cerrato spent six seasons with Notre Dame before joining the  
49ers for eight seasons, including four as director of player 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cerrato will begin work immediately and focus on player  
acquisition and development. Other administrative duties handled 
previously by Casserly will be assumed by a yet-to-be-hired team 
president.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley Campaigns Spar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The rival campaigns of Bill Bradley and Al  
Gore traded personal barbs for the first time Friday -- over the 
issue of campaign finance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bradley camp poked at the vice president's woes after his  
1996 fund-raising tactics -- soliciting campaign contributions on 
official White House phones and wooing donors inside a Buddhist 
temple -- nearly led to an independent counsel investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``From all the accounts that I have read, your candidate's  
personal experiences with raising 'soft money' in the 1996 election 
would have led us to believe he would wholeheartedly join with 
Senator Bradley in his call for a campaign purged'' of such 
unlimited and unregulated money, Bradley campaign chairman Douglas 
Berman wrote to Gore's general campaign chairman, Tony Coelho. 
</P>
<P>
	In turn, Coelho accused the former New Jersey senator of having  
dropped the fight for campaign finance reform when he ``abandoned 
the Senate for private life and two million dollars in special 
interest speaking and consulting fees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the letters were exchanged between Berman and Coelho, the  
two camps vying for the Democratic presidential nomination appeared 
to operate on parallel planes, only rarely engaging each other and, 
even then, in polite policy-focused statements. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, who said in 1996 when he announced he wouldn't run for  
another Senate term, ``We live in a time when on a basic level 
politics is broken,'' has said he is committed to a positive 
campaign. It was Gore's strategy to target Republican front runner 
George W. Bush and act as if competition from the Democratic side 
didn't exist. 
</P>
<P>
	The back-and-forth spat began Thursday, when Bradley unveiled  
details of a campaign finance overhaul and accused Gore of speaking 
out against unregulated contributions to political parties even as 
he plotted how to use the so-called ``soft money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That prompted Coelho to release a letter that afternoon  
questioning Bradley's record on the issue, and led to Friday's 
increasingly testy volley of accusations.

<HEADLINE> Ravens, McAlister OK 4-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OWINGS MILLS, Md. (AP) -- The Baltimore Ravens and cornerback  
Chris McAlister agreed on Friday to a four-year contract, meaning 
the Ravens will have their No. 1 draft pick in uniform at the start 
of training camp for the first time in three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Ravens director of  
player personnel Ozzie Newsome said the contract includes a signing 
bonus. McAlister's agent, Eugene Parker, did not immediately return 
a phone call from The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot, 199-pound McAlister was the 10th player picked in  
the 1999 NFL draft. He led the University of Arizona with 15 pass 
deflections and five interceptions last year and became only the 
seventh player in college football history to return a kickoff, 
punt and interception for a touchdown in the same season. 
</P>
<P>
	McAlister, who will report to training camp Wednesday, is  
expected to compete for a starting job. The Ravens hope he will 
fill in for Rod Woodson, who is moving from cornerback to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, Ravens top pick Peter Boulware staged a holdout  
before reporting late in training camp. Cornerback Duane Starks, 
the team's top choice last year, also missed time because of a 
holdout. 
</P>
<P>
	McAlister, however, will get the full benefit of an entire  
training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``This deal was made because there was a willingness on both  
sides to get it done,'' Newsome said. ``Both parties wanted to make 
a deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because the Ravens have a new head coach, Brian Billick, getting  
McAlister to report on time was essential. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brian is trying to install a new offensive system, so the  
defense will have to carry us for maybe the first 50 percent of the 
schedule,'' Newsome said. ``Chris is a big part of that defense. 
Now he will be able to work with us from the beginning and get all 
the repetitions in practice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McAlister's 18 interceptions ranks third on Arizona's career  
chart. He was the second defensive back taken in the draft behind 
Camp Bailey.

<HEADLINE> NASA's 1st Female Commander Soars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- With NASA's first female space  
shuttle commander at the controls, Columbia carried the world's 
most powerful X-ray telescope safely into orbit today despite an 
electrical problem on the way up. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force Col. Eileen Collins was barely nine seconds into her  
flight when she radioed down that she had a fuel cell problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-eight tense seconds later, after scrutinizing the data,  
Mission Control informed Collins and the four other astronauts the 
problem appeared to be a short circuit in an electrical system. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop in voltage, which lasted only half a second, caused the  
loss of a controller on two of Columbia's three main engines. Each 
engine has two controllers, and only one is needed for an engine to 
operate properly and propel the shuttle into orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia ended up seven miles short of its intended orbit,  
however, when the engines cut off one second early because of a low 
supply of liquid oxygen. As it turned out, the gap didn't matter 
for the release of the $1.5 billion Chandra X-ray Observatory, 
scheduled for later in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The 45-foot telescope, which weighs 50,000 pounds with its  
rocket motor and support gear, is the heaviest payload ever carried 
by a space shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuttle manager Donald McMonagle said engineers will continue to  
monitor the voltage issue to try to determine what happened, but 
noted the five-day mission will not be affected. Collins and 
everyone else responded ``marvelously, exactly by the books,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it was a nerve-racking debut for the first woman to  
command a mission in 38 years of U.S. human space flight. Her 
launch had been delayed three days by faulty hydrogen measurements, 
then lightning. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to be back in zero-g again,'' said the 42-year-old  
Collins, who flew twice before as a shuttle co-pilot. As for all 
the problems, the former test pilot and C-141 commander calmly 
noted: ``A few things to work on ascent kept it interesting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Youngs listened intently to the conversation unfolding  
between his wife and Mission Control as he held their 3 1/2-year-old 
daughter, Bridget. Astronauts standing nearby assured him it was 
``no big deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If it was real bad, we would have heard a little more  
excitement,'' said Youngs, an airline pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA scientist Alan Bunner, who's in charge of the telescope  
program, acknowledged a few heart-stopping moments. ``It's a risky 
business,'' he pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
	Well-wishers cheered Collins as she headed to the launch pad  
late Thursday for the third time this week. Among those unable to 
return for the historic event were Hillary Rodham Clinton and 
daughter Chelsea. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eileen, Just Do It!!!'' read a sign waved by a female space  
worker. In her other hand was the sign ``Don't Come Back,'' in 
reference to the delays. 
</P>
<P>
	The pressure was on. Had the space shuttle not lifted off today,  
it would have been grounded for a month because of the impending 
shutdown of the Air Force's launch facilities for modifications. 
</P>
<P>
	The mission already is a year late because of problems that have  
kept the telescope grounded: computer software problems, bad 
circuit boards and, most recently, a suspect rocket motor. 
</P>
<P>
	From an orbit stretching one-third of the way to the moon,  
Chandra will spend at least five years searching for black holes 
and peering at galaxies, quasars and exploded stars. Astronomers 
hope to learn more about the mysterious dark matter that is 
believed to fill the universe, and better determine the distance to 
celestial objects. 
</P>
<P>
	At $2.8 billion, including the shuttle ride and five years of  
orbital operations, it is one of NASA's most expensive science 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
	It joins the Hubble Space Telescope and the Compton Gamma Ray  
Observatory in NASA's Great Observatory series. Still to come: an 
infrared telescope to be launched in 2001.

	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil is going to deploy soldiers and  
army helicopters to combat illegal logging in the Amazon 
rainforest, Brazil's Environmental Minister said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The operation will involve 200 inspectors from the country's  
Environmental Protection Agency as well as 70 soldiers and seven 
helicopters, said minister Jose Sarney Filho. The operation began 
in June and it will have help from the army as of next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 10 percent of loggers in the Amazon obey environmental  
laws, the agency estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmental groups say that some 60 percent of the rainforest  
remains intact. Government figures put the figure at about 80

	Stocks End Mixed; Dow Down 58.26  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks extended their losses today as  
the renewed threat of higher interest rates convinced investors 
that the strong corporate earnings of the second quarter may be in 
jeopardy. At the close of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones 
industrial average was down 58.26 at 10,910.96, adding to 
yesterday's 33-point drop. Broader stock indicators were mixed. The 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 4.03 to 1,356.94, and the Nasdaq 
composite index rose 7.44 to 2,691.88. Banks and brokerages led the 
Dow lower as yesterday's remarks from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan echoed on Wall Street. He said the central bank would

	ATLANTA (AP) -- PepsiCo has acknowledged filing the complaint  
that prompted a European investigation of charges Coca-Cola is 
illegally trying to force competitors out of the market. While 
Pepsi refrained from beating up on its rival during Coke's recent 
contamination scare in Belgium, analysts say the No. 2 soft-drink 
maker is trying to gain a competitive edge by distracting Coke with 
regulatory and legal challenges. The European Union suspects Coke 
may have offered rebates to retailers to shut out competition in 
markets the Atlanta-based company already dominates. The EU 
confirmed this week that raids were conducted at Coca-Cola offices 
in four European countries. Pepsi said today it first complained to 
European regulators about Coke's business practices last year and 
formally filed its complaint June 1. Coca-Cola again today denied 
wrongdoing while declining comment on Pepsi's action.

made $494.7 million from late fees in the latest quarter, more than 
twice as much as in the second quarter of 1998, admitted to around 
700,000 overcharges. The admission of error comes after 20 months

late fees for bills paid on time, and adding on unauthorized

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Merck's second-quarter earnings rose 12 percent,

Zocor and its pharmacy benefit management business. Merck made a 
$1.48 billion profit in the second quarter, or 61 cents per share, 
compared to $1.32 billion or 54 cents per share in the same period

	Chevron Earnings Off; Mobil Is Even  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Chevron Corp.'s earnings dropped 39 percent in  
the second quarter, as the result of persistent refinery problems 
in California, weakness in the Asian economies and restructuring 
costs. Meanwhile, on the strength of increased revenues from 
exploration and production, Mobil Corp.'s second-quarter earnings 
were on par with those of last year. Both companies beat analysts' 
expectations. Shares of Chevron ended at 93 13/16, up 3/16. Shares 
of Mobil ended at 102 5/8, up 1 1/16.

<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- Kaiser Aluminum Corp. and the United  
Steelworkers will resume negotiations early next month to end a 
10-month labor dispute that has idled 3,000 workers and financially 
battered the company. The parties are to meet Aug. 2-3 and Aug. 
9-13 in Denver, and Aug. 23-26 in San Francisco. The company -- 
operating with management personnel and replacement workers -- has 
reported losses in the three quarters since steelworkers walked off 
their jobs last Sept. 30 at three Washington state operations and 
at plants in Gramercy, La., and Newark, Ohio. Kaiser asked the 
union to resume talks.

	Court Reinstates Tyson Conviction

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal appeals court today reinstated the  
conviction of a Tyson Foods Inc. executive who had been found 
guilty of providing illegal gifts to former Agriculture Secretary 
Mike Espy. The ruling sends the case of Archie Schaffer III back 
for sentencing on the grounds that he violated the Meat Inspection 
Act. A lower court had overturned the jury's guilty verdict on two 
counts -- violating the Meat Inspection Act and the federal gratuity 
statute. The appeals court left alone the acquittal concerning the 
federal gratuity statute.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Almost one-third of Americans, anticipating  
problems from the Y2K computer bug, plan to stock up on food, water 
and other supplies, an Associated Press poll has found. And 
one-quarter of the population will take extra money out of the 
bank. Most Americans -- 66 percent -- expect only minor problems when 
computer programs try to deal with the new millennium, but many are 
playing it safe anyhow. Women are more likely than men to stock up 
on supplies. And blacks were more likely to take precautions than 
all the others. The poll of 1,008 adults was conducted for the AP 
by ICR of Media, Pa.,

<HEADLINE>  New Cleveland Browns Open Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- For some of them, the only memories of the  
Cleveland Browns were the stories their fathers passed down. For 
others, a chance to see the new Browns was akin to a religious 
pilgrimage. 
</P>
<P>
	After three lonely years without the NFL, Browns fans welcomed  
back their beloved team Thursday as the expansion club held its 
first summer practice since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,300 days had passed since Cleveland had NFL players  
to cheer. And about 200 die-hard fans braved sweltering heat to 
show how happy they were. 
</P>
<P>
	To them, everything the Browns do, from their first workout  
until their final game of the 1999 season, will be important and 
historic. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the reason we came today,'' said Dale Galbraith, who  
along with buddy Steve Heyman drove six hours overnight from 
Indianapolis to see the workout. ``We had to be here. But it still 
doesn't feel like we're watching the Browns. I guess it really 
hasn't sunk in yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the Browns finished their morning workout, rookie  
quarterback Tim Couch pulled off his orange helmet, shed his white 
No. 2 practice jersey and shoulder pads and walked over to some of 
the fans who arrived at 7 a.m. to see their new heroes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, how's it going?'' Couch asked.  
</P>
<P>
	Well, Cleveland is feeling much better, thank you.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, as Couch, Cleveland's future franchise quarterback,  
walked on the field alongside expected starter Ty Detmer, fans 
carried on as if this was a fall Sunday afternoon in the Dawg 
Pound. 
</P>
<P>
	They barked. They screamed. And they gave the players a taste of  
the kind of passion the city showed when it wouldn't allow Art 
Modell to take their colors or nickname with him to Baltimore in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was amazing,'' Couch said after the two-hour morning  
workout. ``These fans are something special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Browns coach Chris Palmer had 34 players -- mostly rookies -- on  
the field Thursday. The veterans are expected Saturday and the full 
squad of 89 players will have its first workout Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie safety Marquis Smith was one of just four defensive backs  
who had to be on the field for every snap as the team went through 
7-on-7 passing drills. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was hot,'' said Smith, sweat pouring off his head 20  
minutes after practice. ``I was dying out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once Palmer gets his full roster on the field, he'll have just  
two weeks until the exhibition opener against Dallas on Aug. 9 in 
the Hall of Fame game. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, an NFL head coach for the first time, was pleased with  
Thursday's workout. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could see there weren't a lot of blown assignments,'' he  
said. ``We're making steps in the right direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer likes the progress made by Couch, whom the Browns  
selected with the No. 1 overall pick in the April draft and signed 
to a seven-year, $59.4 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch struggled during minicamps, trying to adjust to the speed  
of the pro game and the various defensive coverages. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows the playbook and now he has to go out and execute the  
plays,'' Palmer said. ``Sometimes it takes four or five times to 
understand the plays, and once they do that, they can go out and 
execute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During his time off, Couch returned home to Hyden, Ky., spending  
weeks learning the thick playbook and working out with Browns tight 
end Ryan Collins. He also got engaged. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt really comfortable today,'' Couch said. ``It's just a  
matter of getting a lot reps and just learning as I go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns want Detmer to quicken their young quarterback's  
development. But Detmer knows it won't be long before he's the one 
on the sideline watching. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody knows Tim is the guy for the future,'' said Detmer,  
a nine-year veteran and the guy of the present. ``I don't have any 
pressure on me right now. I'm supposed to be a backup. I go out and 
play, do the best I can and just have fun and enjoy it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fans are doing the same. Their passion helped convince the  
NFL to return football to Cleveland. Now they're breaking out their 
old Browns gear to root for their new team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, it was a long, long three years,'' Galbraith said. ``I  
didn't even watch football for the first two. But now we're back.''

	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Pitcher Odalis Perez, bothered by a strained  
ligament in his left elbow, was placed on the 15-day disabled list 
Friday by the Atlanta Braves, who recalled left-hander Micah Bowie 
from Triple-A Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez, a rookie who started the season in the Braves' rotation,  
was 4-6 with a 6.00 ERA. On Thursday, he gave up three earned runs 
and four hits in 1 2-3 innings against Florida in his shortest 
outing this season.

	Perez complained of the injury when he arrived at Veterans  
Stadium on Friday. The team sent him back to Atlanta to be examined 
by orthopedic surgeon Dr. Joe Chandler.

	Sen. Kennedy Delivers JFK Jr. Eulogy  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In a heartbreakingly familiar scene, John F.  
Kennedy Jr. was eulogized today as a free spirit who ``had every 
gift but length of years.'' ``He was a boy who grew into a man with 
a zest for life and a love of adventure,'' said Sen. Edward 
Kennedy, JFK Jr.'s uncle. The memorial Mass came a week after the 
young Kennedy's plane crashed off Martha's Vineyard -- killing him, 
his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and sister-in-law Lauren 
Bessette. At the end of the 10-minute eulogy, JFK Jr.'s sister, 
Caroline Kennedy, read from Shakespeare's ``The Tempest'' and, 
helped by her husband and three children, lighted a candle.

	RABAT, Morocco (AP) -- King Hassan II, a Middle East peacemaker  
who ruled this North African nation for 38 years, died today. He 
was 70. The health of the monarch has been fragile for some years. 
His successor will be his son, Crown Prince Sidi Mohamed, who 
announced the death on state television. The monarch was 
hospitalized hours earlier for an acute lung infection, according 
to a palace statement. The Crown Prince gave the cause of death as 
a heart attack.

	FBI Cancels Headquarters Tours

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI halted the popular public tours of its  
headquarters building today for an indefinite period in response to 
an unconfirmed, nonspecific threat against bureau facilities in 
this city and earlier threats against the headquarters itself. NBC 
News reported that the recent threat concerned possible terrorist 
attacks by followers of Osama bin Laden, the wealthy Islamic 
radical who is charged in this country with masterminding last 
August's bombings of U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that 
killed 224 people, including 12 Americans.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Angered by a fierce Chinese campaign against  
him, the leader of a meditation group newly outlawed by China's 
communist rulers accused Beijing today of trying to brainwash his 
followers. The Chinese government has forced many detained 
followers to watch ``fabricated'' videotapes that claim the group's 
teachings encourage people to stop taking medicine or mutilate 
themselves, Li Hongzhi said in an interview at a supporter's 
apartment in New York City. Despite Beijing's banning of his Falun 
Gong group this week, Li remained defiant and said he could not 
stop his followers from continuing to protest in several Chinese 
cities.

	HOUSTON (AP) -- A judge set a Feb. 14 trial date today for  
suspected serial killer Angel Maturino Resendiz, who was formally 
charged with the slaying of a Houston-area doctor and ordered to 
undergo a psychological exam. The rail-riding drifter, who 
surrendered July 13, is suspected in six Texas killings, two in 
Illinois and another in Kentucky. He's charged with five of the 
murders, including the December death of Dr. Claudia Benton. At 
today's arraignment, Defense attorney Allen Tanner entered a plea 
of innocent on his client's behalf.

are expected to be issued soon and would allow U.S. companies to 
obtain a license from the Treasury Department to sell food and 
medicine to three countries, a department official said today. The 
regulations would not require congressional approval and would take 
effect immediately unless otherwise stipulated, the official said, 
speaking on condition of anonymity.

matador -- more through guts than skill. She calls herself Eva 
Florencia, a show-biz name honoring her home town of Florence, but 
her parents know she's really Eva Bianchini. Although it's a 
supremely macho world she wants to break into, the 20-year-old is 
undaunted -- even by the recent retirement of Spain's top female 
matador, Cristina Sanchez, who said she was fed up with toreros who 
wouldn't fight alongside her.

<HEADLINE> FAA Investigates 'Rushed' Flight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Aviation Administration is  
investigating a GOP lawmaker's complaint that an airline flight may 
have been rushed to the detriment of passenger safety in order to 
get several House Democrats to a fund-raiser for Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind., told the FAA he had witnessed ``a  
potentially serious threat to passenger safety'' on a Northwest 
Airlines Flight last month from Washington to Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers were boarded so quickly on Flight 1125, Souder wrote  
in a letter to FAA administrator Jane Garvey, that the crew told 
some of them to hold luggage in their laps until the plane left the 
gate, a violation of FAA rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Souder said ``apparently the flight was to be expedited''  
because Democratic Reps. John Dingell and Debbie Stabenow of 
Michigan needed to reach Detroit for a fund-raising dinner that 
evening for the vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA spokesman Paul Turk said Friday that the agency was  
``investigating the contents of the letter and will report to the 
congressman in due course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest Airlines spokesman Jon Austin said that flight was  
reviewed by the company and, although the aircraft was sent out 
quickly, ``safety was never compromised.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dingell said Souder's letter sounded like it was motivated by  
partisan politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very flattered that I am attributed power to accomplish  
what was supposed to have been done, but I really had nothing to do 
with it,'' said Dingell, the senior Democrat and former chairman of 
the House Commerce Committee, which oversees the airline industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Souder said he and other passengers waiting for the delayed  
flight in the gate area at Ronald Reagan Washington National 
Airport on June 25 were ``suddenly informed over the public address 
system that the flight would have to be ready for departure in 20 
minutes or be canceled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers were lined up for quick boarding, and flight or gate  
attendants kept telling them how many minutes remained before the 
time limit expired, he said. As time became short, ``the crew 
hurriedly began to instruct passengers not to stow their luggage in 
the overhead bins, but instead to hold it in their laps until the 
plane left the gate,'' Souder wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest officials said flight attendants have confirmed that  
all carry-on items were stowed safely prior to departure. Dingell 
said of Souder's allegation about the luggage: ``I don't remember 
that, but it could have happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Austin said a gate agent mistakenly announced that the flight  
might be canceled if it did not take off at 5:50 p.m., or in 20 
minutes. He said the agent has been told she should not have said 
that and has been counseled on the proper way to board passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	Souder said he later overheard a senior flight attendant  
``explain that senior airline management had demanded that the 
plane depart in 20 minutes because of an impending Democratic party 
fund-raiser in Detroit for Vice President Gore that evening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Dingell and Stabenow attended the Gore fund-raiser, their  
offices confirmed, along with Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich., who was 
also on the same flight but was not mentioned by Sounder. 
</P>
<P>
	Dingell confirmed that he received two phone calls from  
Northwest management while sitting in their customer lounge, 
waiting for the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told them I was sitting there reading my paper, and I would  
appreciate anything they could do to get me out, but I wasn't 
asking them to do anything -- proper or improper,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Berry: No Room for Black Actresses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Halle Berry says Hollywood isn't ready for a  
black leading lady. 
</P>
<P>
	The actress came to that conclusion after starring in the  
upcoming HBO movie ``Introducing Dorothy Dandridge,'' about the 
first black woman nominated for an Academy Award as best actress. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the last six months, I have not been able to find a  
project that can even compare to the role that I've just been able 
to play, so that's how I'm sure there's no place for a black 
leading lady right now,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry, whose credits include ``Bulworth'' and ``The  
Flintstones,'' also served as an executive producer for the first 
time on the HBO movie. 
</P>
<P>
	``Producing always seemed so scary to me, you have to make  
something happen,'' she said. ``Now that I've done it, I realize 
that producers don't even know what they're doing. There's no 
formula, you just have to have passion to do it.''

<HEADLINE> Safeway To Buy Randall's for $1.4B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Supermarket powerhouse Safeway Inc. will purchase  
the 116-store Houston-based Randall's Food Markets chain in a $1.4 
billion cash and stock deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company will operate more than 1,645 stores in 19  
states and in Western Canada, employing more than 183,000 people. 
Sales are estimated at $30 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Safeway Inc., based in Pleasanton, Calif., is one of the largest  
food and drug retailers in North America with annual sales of more 
than $27 billion. Randall's, which operates 46 stores in Houston 
and 12 in Austin, plus 58 Tom Thumb stores in the Dallas-Fort Worth 
area, will continue to operate under the Randall's and Tom Thumb 
names. 
</P>
<P>
	``This transaction is a wonderful opportunity for Safeway to  
continue its growth strategy, and we are thrilled to be re-entering 
the fast-growing Texas market with such a high quality operation,'' 
Safeway chairman Steve Burd said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Randall's chairman R. Randall Onstead Jr., whose family owns 21  
percent of Randall's outstanding shares, also hailed the merger, 
citing the supermarket industry's trend toward consolidation. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a member of the Safeway team, we will have an even larger  
base of financial strength, buying power, best practices and 
successful private brands from which to grow,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Safeway will pay $855 million in cash and exchange about 10.9  
million shares of Safeway stock for Randall's shares. Safeway also 
will assume $375 million of Randall's debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Safeway expects to complete the purchase, which awaits the  
approval of a majority of Randall's outstanding shares, during the 
third quarter of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Safeway rose $2.75, or 5 percent, to $53.50 in trading  
on the New York Stock Exchange

<HEADLINE> Quayle Says He Tops Leno Joke List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dan Quayle is beating out his fellow GOP  
presidential contenders by at least one measure: being the butt of 
Jay Leno jokes. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the Leno poll, I'm number one,'' the former vice president  
declared proudly Thursday on NBC's ``The Tonight Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Quayle should know. He's been keeping track. So far this  
year, the he's been the target of 52 jokes by the late night talk 
show host, outpacing all of his Republican competitors, Quayle 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, I love those jokes,'' Quayle. ``It makes my day.''  
</P>
<P>
	Quayle explained his special distinction as regular fodder for  
late night comedy with an anecdote. Soon after Quayle became vice 
president, former president Richard Nixon shared this piece of 
wisdom: vice presidents bear the brunt of the jokes when there is a 
popular president in office. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why I've said that Al Gore has got to be luckiest vice  
president in the history of America,'' said Quayle. ``He's had Bill 
Clinton there all these years.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Stocks slumped on Asian financial markets  
Friday, with the key index in Seoul tumbling 7.3 percent and 
registering a record point drop. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said South Korean shares fell on jitters over rising  
local interest rates and the Daewoo Group's financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, stocks were pressured by comments Thursday from U.S.  
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who cautioned about the 
dangers of stock market euphoria and also renewed fears that 
American interest rates are headed higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell 71.70 points to  
904.96, its biggest daily point drop on record and the 
third-largest percentage decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Although creditor banks have promised to extend $3.3 billion in  
loans to Daewoo Group, there are doubts about whether the 
conglomerate will be able to resolve its troubles, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 195.90 points,  
or 1.1 percent, to close at 17,534.44. On Thursday, the average 
plunged 527.18 points, or 2.9 percent.

	Singapore shares were sharply lower, with the Straits Times  
Index falling 77.74 points, or 3.9 percent, to 1,990.15.

	In addition, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 2.1 percent and  
major indexes fell 2.6 percent in Indonesia, 2.4 percent in 
Thailand and 1.6 percent in the Philippines.

<HEADLINE> UPS Workers Ponder Stock Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- United Parcel Service's plans to sell stock to  
the public for the first time has the company's brown-uniformed 
delivery workers pondering whether the deal means a windfall for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Abe Diaz, a UPS accounts administrator in New York, sees  
enormous potential and said he's eager to add to his stock holdings 
``as much as I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to see it really jump through the roof,'' said Diaz,  
who has worked 28 years for UPS. ``It's always done fairly well. 
There's no reason it shouldn't continue to do so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 66,000 non-management UPS workers own shares of the  
privately held company. The rest of the stock is held by about 
40,000 UPS managers, 17,000 retirees, and members of the founders' 
families and foundations. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta-based UPS plans to sell 10 percent of its stock on Wall  
Street, but those shares will represent only 1 percent of the 
voting rights in the company. The deal is expected to be one of the 
largest initial public offerings in U.S. history, with some 
estimates of the receipts at more than $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts predict UPS's stock will rise once it goes public. But  
the bulk of the offering -- 55 million shares valued at about $2.5 
billion -- will likely keep the price from skyrocketing as some 
shareholders might hope, said Alex Brand, an analyst for Scott and 
Stringfellow in Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there will be a great demand ... but it's much more  
likely to be a gradual (increase),'' Brand said. 
</P>
<P>
	Employees and retirees now own about two-thirds of the company.  
</P>
<P>
	Non-management UPS workers have only been allowed to buy stock  
in the last five years. UPS has the option to buy back retirees' 
shares, and does so every two or three years, said Norman Black, a 
company spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Some employees will be tempted to cash in their stock if the  
price rises, said Michael Keeling, head of the Washington-based 
ESOP Association, a trade group for employee stock ownership 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the human resource issues among employees when they  
become shareholders is the desire to get the money quick,'' Keeling 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	UPS retiree Ernest Head of Dahlonega, Ga., won't have that  
option. 
</P>
<P>
	Head retired in October after delivering packages for UPS for 27  
years. He said he was also a share owner until about two weeks ago, 
when the company informed him it was buying back the 200 shares for 
which he paid $27 apiece in 1995. He received $47 a share from UPS. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would rather have held onto my stock,'' said Head, 57. ``But  
because I'm a retired employee they said that I didn't have an 
option.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As news of the stock sale plans percolated through the company  
Thursday, UPS reported a second-quarter profit of $588 million, a 
increase of 28 percent from the $458 million earned in the same 
period last year. Revenue for the quarter ended June 30 rose 7 
percent to $6.56. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings for the first six months of the year jumped 34 percent  
to $1.09 billion from $810 million a year earlier. Revenues rose 
7.7 percent to $12.89. 
</P>
<P>
	UPS credited the gains in part to the growth of companies  
selling products on the Internet, which have Web sites with 
built-in shipping through UPS. In addition, it reported strong 
growth in business at home and abroad.

<P>
	MILL VALLEY, Calif. (AP) -- The Grateful Dead's Bob Weir has  
given up bachelorhood at 51. 
</P>
<P>
	Weir married Natasha Muenter, a former teacher, on July 15 at  
the couple's Mill Valley home. 
</P>

single-handedly was entrusted by the Dead to uphold rock 'n' roll's 
reputation for comely young maidens has finally gotten married.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Wal-Mart Thrift Deal Is Opposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A community group has filed a formal objection  
with regulators over retail giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s proposed 
entry into the banking business, a few days after the House Banking 
Committee chairman denounced the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Inner City Press/Community on the Move, a liberal group based in  
New York, submitted its objection to the federal Office of Thrift 
Supervision on Thursday, the final day of the public comment period 
for Wal-Mart's proposed purchase of an Oklahoma savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
	Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart, the nation's biggest retailer,  
asked the thrift regulators last month for permission to buy 
Federal BankCentre of Broken Arrow, Okla., and then, after about a 
year, open at least five branches at its stores in several states. 
</P>
<P>
	A Wal-Mart spokesman on Friday defended the company against  
Inner City Press' accusations that it has hurt local communities by 
forcing smaller competitors out of business. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are thousands of big and small businesses across America  
that compete successfully with Wal-Mart every day,'' company 
spokesman Jay Allen said from its headquarters. ``If businesses 
aren't willing to improve and change with the times ..., they have 
a lot more to worry about than Wal-Mart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last weekend, Banking Committee Chairman Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa,  
told a group of Iowa bankers that the proposed deal ``should not be 
allowed'' because it would dangerously mix commerce and banking. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a step toward concentration of commerce and banking  
which I believe to be counter to the American tradition,'' Leach 
said in a speech to the Iowa Independent Bankers Association's 
convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Inner City Press, which often challenges proposed mergers and  
acquisitions in the banking industry, said the Wal-Mart move 
``raises grave issues of public policy'' such as the retailer's 
adherence in the future to laws requiring banks to invest in 
low-income communities. 
</P>
<P>
	The group called the discount chain the ``most destabilizing''  
of the nation's retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're clearly a company that's willing to use their power to  
hurt competitors,'' Matthew Lee, the group's executive director, 
said in a telephone interview Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	A small Arkansas bank, in its own letter to the thrift agency,  
expressed the same criticism of Wal-Mart. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wal-Mart came on the scene and spread across America and ...  
caused many small retailers to be forced out of business,'' wrote 
John R. Stipe, the president of Forrest City Bank of Forrest City, 
Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart spokesman Allen said the company's presence in smaller  
communities would enable it to provide banking and other financial 
services to customers in those towns with limited access to 
financial institutions. Wal-Mart has told the regulators that as 
many as 20 percent of its customers do not have bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks and thrifts operate branches in 450 Wal-Mart stores, but  
the company says some of the institutions have opted against 
opening in locations where Wal-Mart wants banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Some bank branches in Wal-Mart stores belong to Arvest Bank  
Group Inc., also based in Bentonville. Like Wal-Mart, Arvest is 
owned by the Walton family, but there is no direct corporate link 
between the retailer and the bank company. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen, referring to Inner City Press' warning about the company  
meeting investment requirements for banks in low-income 
communities, said, ``We'll comply with all federal laws.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inner City Press maintained that small, local stores -- which now  
have been replaced by Wal-Mart -- had deposited their earnings in 
local banks, while Wal-Mart has a practice of transferring its 
daily receipts back to the Bentonville headquarters. That makes 
less money available for loans in the local communities, the group 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart's sales topped $137 billion last year.  
</P>
<P>
	Leach and other lawmakers have long objected to any mixing of  
banking and commerce, which they believe could create the same 
kinds of financial problems and corruption that have occurred in 
Japan and other countries that allow it. 
</P>
<P>
	``No national interest is served in having a system which allows  
Chase Manhattan (Bank) and General Motors to merge,'' he said in 
his recent speech. ``Likewise, no national interest is served in 
allowing Wal-Mart on its own to become a Norwest (Bank).'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue has been raised by the debate over revamping the  
financial services laws. The House and Senate recently have passed 
sweeping legislation that would lift Depression-era legal barriers 
and allow banks, securities firms and insurance companies to merge.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Shuffles Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- Under pressure from donors to straighten  
out Kenya's economic mess, President Daniel arap Moi made key 
changes in his administration today, putting paleontologist Richard 
Leakey in charge of the civil service. 
</P>
<P>
	Leakey, the head of the Kenya Wildlife Service, was named  
secretary of the Cabinet and permanent secretary in charge of the 
bloated public service. 
</P>
<P>
	Permanent secretaries have deep responsibilities because  
ministers and assistant ministers are political appointees with 
little knowledge of their areas of responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Moi has publicly stated his aversion to Leakey, the son of Louis  
B. and Mary Leakey, who did pioneering research that located the 
origins of humanity in East Africa. But Leakey is recognized as an 
efficient and charismatic manager who will be called on to revive 
Kenya's once well-functioning civil service. 
</P>
<P>
	As a white Kenyan, Leakey is also seen as being above the  
country's complex tribal politics, which have been instrumental in 
the decline of a civil service that used to be based on competence 
and merit. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Friday, Martin Odour Otieno, financial director of  
Barclays Bank Kenya and the former chairman of the Institute of 
Certified Public Accountants of Kenya, was named permanent 
secretary in the Ministry of Finance. 
</P>
<P>
	An International Monetary Fund team that left Kenya recently let  
it be known that the East African nation has not made sufficient 
progress in curbing corruption and keeping government spending 
under control to be eligible for resumption of a $220 million loan 
suspended two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenya's economic growth has slumped to below 1.8 percent per  
year, and the respected East African weekly reported Monday that 
Kenya has defaulted on repayment of $62.1 million owed to creditors 
including France, Britain, Austria and Japan.

<HEADLINE> Chevron Earnings Off; Mobil Is Even </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Chevron Corp.'s earnings dropped 39 percent in the second  
quarter, due to persistent refinery problems in California, 
weakness in the Asian economies and restructuring costs. 
</P>
<P>
	However, on the strength of increased revenues from exploration  
and production, Mobil Corp.'s second-quarter earnings were on par 
with those of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies beat analysts' expectations.  

</P>
<P>
	 *Chevron Corp.    	
</P>
<P>
	Second-quarter earnings for the San Francisco-based energy  
company were $350 million, or 53 cents per share, down from the 
$577 million, or 88 cents per share in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the loss was blamed on a fire at Chevron's Richmond  
refinery and other operational problems that cost the company $100 
million in earnings as Chevron had to sell higher-priced oil bought 
from third parties. Those third-party purchases are continuing 
because the Richmond refinery still isn't repaired, chairman and 
CEO Ken Derr said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The long-awaited recovery in crude oil prices gave our  
exploration and production operations a boost in the second 
quarter,'' Derr said. ``Unfortunately, operational problems at our 
California refineries prevented us from realizing the benefits of a 
strengthened refined products market on the West Coast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding one-time gains and losses in both periods, earnings  
dropped 22 percent, to $484 million, or 73 cents a share, from $620 
million, or 94 cents a share in second-quarter 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call were projecting earnings of 70  
cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income for the first half of 1999 declined 37 percent to  
$679 million, or $1.03 per share, from $1.08 billion, or $1.65 per 
share in 1998. These figures included net charges of $86 million 
for special items this year, and net benefits of $28 million in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron lost $32 million in foreign currency in the quarter,  
compared to gains of $96 million in the year-ago quarter. For the 
six-month period, foreign currency losses were $41 million in 1999, 
compared with gains of $50 million in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Total revenues for the quarter rose 9 percent, to $8.7 billion,  
from $8 billion in last year's second quarter, thanks to higher 
profits from sales of refined products and crude oil. 
</P>
<P>
	For the six-month period, total revenues were $15.4 billion,  
about the same as the first half of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Chevron rose 18 3/4 cents to close at $93.81 1/4 in trading  
on the New York Stock Exchange. 

</P>
<P>
                          	 *Mobil Corp.    	
</P>
<P>
	The nation's second-largest oil company, which plans to merge  
with Exxon Corp., earned $650 million, or 81 cents per diluted 
share, virtually unchanged from the same quarter of 1998, when 
earnings were $655 million, also 81 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had expected earnings of 73 cents per share.  
</P>
<P>
	For the three months ended June 30, Mobil had revenue of $14.2  
billion, up from $13.2 billion in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fairfax, Va.-based company's exploration and producing  
division had $382 million in 1999 second-quarter earnings, up 
considerably from $235 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``Crude oil prices, after deteriorating during the entire year  
of 1998 and most of the first quarter of 1999, have recently shown 
significant improvement,'' said Mobil chairman and CEO Lucio A. 
Noto. 
</P>
<P>
	The higher crude oil prices, however, were more than offset by  
lower worldwide natural gas prices and weaker margins in refining 
and marketing, especially in Mobil's international markets, Noto 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand for oil and refined products fell toward the end of last  
year and the beginning of this year as a result of weak economic 
conditions in Asia, Latin America, Russia and other parts of the 
world. Oil companies were forced to lower the prices they charged 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The pressure on profits has prompted Mobil and other oil  
companies to seek merger partners to cut operating costs. Mobil's 
planned merger with Exxon, which will create the largest company in 
the oil industry, still faces regulatory approval. 
</P>
<P>
	In the six months ended June 30, Mobil earned $1.2 billion, or  
$1.51 per share, on revenue of $26.4 billion. That compared with 
earnings of $1.3 billion, or $1.65 per share, on revenue of $26.9 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Mobil were up $1.06 1/4 to close at $102.62 1/2 on the Big  
Board.

<HEADLINE> NBA Referee Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- Ronnie Nunn, one of 12 NBA referees  
investigated by the IRS for tax evasion, pleaded guilty to the 
charges Friday 
</P>
<P>
	Nunn, 49, waived indictment and entered his plea in U.S.  
District Court to one count of filing a false income tax return for 
the 1993 tax year. 
</P>
<P>
	Nunn admitted that during 1993 he earned more income than he  
declared on his return by cashing in first-class airline tickets 
for coach tickets and pocketing the difference. 
</P>
<P>
	He failed to report between $8,000 and $13,500, including some  
unreported income from 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Nunn faces up to three years in prison and up to $100,000 in  
fines when sentenced Sept. 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten of the referees charged in the investigation already have  
pleaded guilty. They were sentenced to probation or short periods 
of house arrest and ordered to pay the taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	One referee, Steve Javie, was acquitted by a jury in  
Philadelphia in January. Javie was the only referee to plead 
innocent to charges.

<HEADLINE> Chargers' QB Has Sore Shoulder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Ryan Leaf's already rocky NFL career took  
another hit Friday when the San Diego Chargers announced that the 
second-year quarterback needs shoulder surgery and could miss the 
entire season. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgery was scheduled for Monday to repair a torn labrum in his  
right shoulder. Rehabilitation could take to three to four months, 
possibly all season, depending on the extent of the damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough,'' Leaf said. ``I was just getting back to what I  
love to do. I was shocked. I didn't know it was that bad. I just 
thought it was a sprain or something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf injured his shoulder during voluntary workouts in June  
jumping on a fumble. Twenty minutes into the team's first training 
camp practice Friday, he complained of shoulder pain when throwing 
the ball deep. He was taken for MRI exam, which showed the shoulder 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf did not undergo an MRI exam in June.  
</P>
<P>
	The development came one day after the Chargers added a second  
veteran quarterback, Erik Kramer. Coincidentally, Kramer suffered a 
torn labrum and a knee injury that sidelined him for the second 
half of last season while he was with the Chicago Bears, who 
dropped him Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer joins starter Jim Harbaugh, who was acquired by the  
Chargers in a trade with Baltimore in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The second overall pick in the 1998 NFL draft, Leaf signed a  
$31.25 million contract and was named the Chargers' starter. He was 
benched after nine starts due to horrendous play -- he threw 15 
interceptions and just two touchdown passes -- and boorish off-field 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Harbaugh and Kramer took almost all the snaps Friday, which is  
what the Chargers envisioned for the regular season even before 
Leaf was hurt. Some of their passes went to All-Pro linebacker 
Junior Seau, who might be used as a tight end in certain schemes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The critical quarterback position is being developed in San  
Diego,'' new coach Mike Riley said after the first practice. ``It's 
a different picture today than it was yesterday, and it's much 
different than it was six months ago before we even got Jim. I 
think we've got a pretty nice-looking picture right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Whelihan, who started the final seven games last year  
after Leaf was benched, now finds his job secure. He likely would 
have been cut at some point had Leaf not been hurt. Leaf and 
Whelihan combined for 34 interceptions last year.

<HEADLINE> DeShields Returns to O's Lineup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Second baseman Delino DeShields returned to the  
Baltimore Orioles' starting lineup Friday, not a minute too soon 
for manager Ray Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	DeShields was batting .274 and had scored 28 runs in 55 games  
before going on the disabled list June 20 with a strained 
hamstring. He batted eighth against Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's probably not 1,000 percent stealing bases, but I need his  
bat in the lineup,'' Miller said. ``The thing I'm hoping is he's 
back where he was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Hairston Jr. did a fine job in DeShields' place, but  
Miller likes the idea of having a switch-hitter in the lineup. 
Plus, DeShields has far more experience. 
</P>
<P>
	DeShields has gone on the disabled list twice this year, giving  
Miller reason to believe that the veteran might have an advantage 
in the final two months of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``When everyone else is dragging, he should be fresh,'' Miller  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got nothing to say,'' DeShields said before the game,  
waving reporters away. ``I just want to play.''

<HEADLINE> Ford Plant in Brazil Still Struck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Union leaders on Friday vowed to stay  
out on strike at the Ford truck plant in Sao Paulo, saying the 
company's promise to guarantee workers their jobs until year-end 
was insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 1,500 workers went on strike Thursday after a newspaper  
reported that the Ford would shut down its Sao Paulo factory and 
transfer production to the northeastern state of Bahia. 
</P>
<P>
	The strike brought the facility in a working-class neighborhood  
of Sao Paulo to a standstill. It normally produces 120 trucks a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford denied it was planning to move the plant to Bahia but  
acknowledged it was studying the possibility of transferring it to 
a less densely populated area in Sao Paulo state. 
</P>
<P>
	After a meeting with Ford's human resources director, Carlos  
Augusto Marino, labor leaders said Thursday that an agreement was 
reached to guarantee jobs for the workers through Dec. 31. That was 
expected to get the workers' back on their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleno Bezerra, secretary general of the Sao Paulo Metalworkers  
Union, said Ford also promised to keep the truck factory in Sao 
Paulo state and would give the union a say as to where it will be 
moved. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Friday, Carlos Abreu Ortiz, director of the Sao Paulo  
metal workers union, said the strike would continue until Ford 
promised to move the workers along with the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortiz said the union planned to stage protests to call attention  
to the workers' plight.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Fall Sharply Again / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bonds fell sharply for a second day Friday,  
boosting a key interest rate above 6 percent amid jitters sparked 
by an inflation warning by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 23/32  
point, or $7.19 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
	Its yield, a key influence on the interest charged for many  
types of loans, rose to 6.02 percent, up from 5.96 percent late 
Thursday and the first finish above 6 percent in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
fell 3/32 to 7/32 point, and intermediate maturities fell 7/16 to 
15/32 point, according to Bridge Telerate news service. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second straight day of heavy selling after Thursday's  
midyear report to Congress by Greenspan, who suggested the Fed may 
need to lift its lending rates again to slow the economy and 
contain inflationary forces. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading Friday, yields on three-month Treasury bills  
rose 4.65 percent, while the discount rose to 4.53 percent, up 0.03 
percentage point from late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Six-month yields finished at 4.69 percent as the discount rose  
0.03 percentage point to 4.52 percent. One-year yields rose to 5.01 
percent as the discount rose to 4.72 percent, up 0.04 percentage 
point from late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 5.00 percent, down from 5.13 percent from late 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 5/16 point to 118 31/32. The average 
yield to maturity rose to 5.52 percent, up from 5.50 percent late 
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> PBS Will Fight For Federal Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Under fire on Capitol Hill for sharing its donor  
lists with the Democrats, PBS is determined to fight for its 
federal funds, even if they represent only 14 percent of its 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The Public Broadcasting Service argues that the subsidy is more  
important than the small percentage might suggest, since it 
triggers other donations and its elimination would represent a 
major philosophical shift. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not worth going it alone, even if it avoids nasty political  
scrapes, said Ervin Duggan, PBS president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you talk about privatizing public broadcasting, you're  
really using a euphemism for commercializing public broadcasting,'' 
he said, ``and the entire mission of the institution changes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week it was disclosed that at least two dozen public  
television stations exchanged membership lists with political 
groups. Some Republican lawmakers responded by renewing calls to 
strip public broadcasting of its $250 million government subsidy. 
</P>
<P>
	PBS's portion of that money accounts for 14 percent of its  
operating revenue. When the system began 30 years ago, Congress 
kicked in more than half of the funds, one expert said. It was down 
to one-fifth by 1980 and the percentage has dropped steadily since 
then. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, member  
television and radio stations also get a portion of the federal 
pie. The money represents anywhere from 10 percent to nearly 40 
percent of the TV stations' budgets, with the money more important 
for smaller stations that serve rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
	PBS's share of $37 million is ``absolutely essential seed  
money,'' spokesman Thomas Epstein said. The federal funds trigger 
matching state grants for educational programming and encourage 
private investment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some PBS programming, such as the investigative series  
``Frontline'' and American drama, wouldn't attract enough private 
funding to stay on the air, the executives said. 
</P>
<P>
	PBS attracted $186 million in corporate underwriting in 1998, up  
$44 million from the previous year. Its largest source of funding 
remains donations by viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Public broadcasting's aggressiveness in seeking other funding  
sources has led some critics to suggest the system's mission has 
already changed. Certainly it has led to touchy moments: ``Sesame 
Street'' was criticized by Ralph Nader for broadcasting a 15-second 
message from an indoor playground manufacturer that had kicked in 
$1 million toward producing the show. 
</P>
<P>
	``The greater the commercial pressure, the greater the need to  
tailor programming to corporate underwriting,'' said James 
Ledbetter, author of ``Made Possible By...,'' a book about public 
broadcasting. ``There are a lot of people who would argue that they 
are there already.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's been more than a decade since PBS produced a program geared  
to blacks, arguably the type of community underserved by commercial 
broadcasters that the public system was invented for, Ledbetter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, many PBS stations air a nightly business  
roundup -- even though several cable channels do the same thing -- 
because that's attractive to corporate sponsors, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Public TV is best looked upon as a kind of niche market within  
commercial broadcasting, rather than an alternative to it,'' 
Ledbetter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Duggan said he is ``aware of no evidence that we have pulled our  
punches or succumbed to the needs'' of sponsors. Public 
broadcasting's diversity of fund sources ensures its independence, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harry Forbes, a PBS spokesman, called Ledbetter ``off the  
mark,'' saying the system ``has a very strong track record of 
providing programming by and for African-Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last season alone, he said, PBS aired the late Henry Hampton's  
final work, ``I'll Make Me a World,'' and ``Africans in America,'' 
a Peabody winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Public broadcasters are protective of public funding because of  
the looming expenses related to the transformation to a digital 
marketplace. It will require the formation of new channels and 
major equipment purchases, costing an estimated $1.7 billion, 
Epstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	PBS and Ledbetter agree that public broadcasting would be better  
served by a funding mechanism that insulates it from recurring 
political battles, either a trust fund or a dedicated revenue 
stream. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a lot of ways, there is now more than ever a need for a  
truly public broadcasting system,'' Ledbetter said. ``I think the 
issue of providing a true lens on American society is always a 
vital idea and something that cable networks and commercial 
broadcasting does very incompletely.''

<HEADLINE> Woodstock '99 Draws Thousands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME, N.Y. (AP) -- Woodstock '99 seems a totally different scene  
than the original 30 years ago, with credit-card hawkers and an 
``extreme sports'' park thrown in with the tunes. 
</P>
<P>
	Another sign of the times: The three-day festival beginning  
today isn't being held at Max Yasgur's rolling farm but at the 
former Griffiss Air Force Base, complete with a post office, 
telephone banks and ATM machines. 
</P>
<P>
	The vibe is the same, insists Neil Bryson, an original Woodstock  
veteran on hand for this year's show with his 16-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like it was there, everyone is here to have a good time,'' he  
said. ``People are nice, friendly. There's no attitudes here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some 150,000 people were on site at daybreak and organizers  
expected another 70,000 to arrive by midday, said promoter John 
Scher. 
</P>
<P>
	Troopers were parking 2,200-2,400 cars per hour, said state  
police Maj. James Parmley. About 55,000 cars were already parked on 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	Cars and vans began rolling into Rome at daybreak Thursday,  
causing some periodic congestion on the three major routes but no 
major tie-ups, Parmley said. There were two minor accidents but no 
injuries, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While traffic flowed smoothly, Thursday's biggest concern was  
the heat, said security director Ken Donohue. Temperatures nearing 
90 degrees and high humidity left a number of concertgoers 
suffering from heat exhaustion Thursday and the forecast was for 
similar weather again today. 
</P>
<P>
	Parmley said three arrests were made overnight, all off the  
festival compound. Two were minor and one involved a speeding 
motorist who was driving drunk and had drugs in his possession. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been relatively few incidents,'' Parmley said.  
``It's remarkable how quiets things have been. The concertgoers 
have been gracious and polite to us. Their attitude has been 
great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers allowed campers into the grounds three hours earlier  
than planned Thursday when traffic began to amass at the former 
base's two main gates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm impressed,'' said Shari Spiro, 40, who brought her  
16-year-old daughter. ``It looks like they are really ready to 
handle a large volume of people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the performers are Sugar Ray, Sheryl Crow, Live, Willie  
Nelson, Bush, Jewel, Alanis Morissette, Insane Clown Posse, 
Metallica, Dave Matthews Band, Rage Against the Machine and Ice 
Cube. 
</P>
<P>
	Concertgoers were looking forward to a weekend of an eclectic  
music mix with expected hot weather. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not here to hear anyone special,'' said Jamie Jancosek,  
23. ``We're here to listen to it all -- except country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why it's the best place to be,'' added travel mate Kurt  
Miller, 20. ``Everything is here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 29th anniversary Woodstock show was held last year at the  
original site in Bethel, N.Y.

<HEADLINE> 13th Pan American Games Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Canadian Olympic medalists Silken  
Laumann and Alwyn Morris lit the cauldron at the 13th Pan American 
Games, capping a colorful opening ceremony Friday that featured a 
sweep of samba and a relaxed parade of athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven aboriginal athletes snubbed three decades ago when Canada  
last staged the games also returned with the flame for the ceremony 
in Winnipeg Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The athletes carried the torch to the 1967 Pan Ams in Winnipeg  
in a 500-mile trek that traditionally precedes Olympic-type 
competitions -- but were not even allowed to attend the opening. 
</P>
<P>
	This time though, they were honored guests.  
</P>
<P>
	``I believe we are a unifying force to the games,'' said David  
Courchene Jr., one of the runners. ``We are carrying the spirit of 
our people. ... We are bringing a message of peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The torch-lighting and the role of the 1967 torch bearers was a  
centerpiece of the extravaganza. Waving hats and hands, some 5,000 
athletes from 42 countries marched into the stadium, including 
large delegations from the United States, Canada, Cuba, Brazil and 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Laumann was favored to win the single sculls rowing in 1992 in  
Barcelona. But 73 days before the Olympics, a boat rammed her, 
driving wood through her lower right leg, breaking the bone and 
cutting muscles and nerves. Doctors told her it would take six 
months to recover, but she had surgery five times, went to 
Barcelona vowing not to finish last, and won a bronze. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris won gold and bronze in kayak pairs in the 1984 Olympics  
and is a Mohawk Indian from Caughawaga Reserve in Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. flag bearer was triathlete Karen Smyers, 37, who said  
she was ``flabbergasted'' by the honor. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony relied on audience participation for a few of the  
event's more colorful touches. Spectators were handed programs with 
flags from around the hemisphere, allowing them to hold up a 
nation's flag as athletes paraded past. 
</P>
<P>
	The gimmick gave the island nation of St. Kitts and Nevis, with  
a population of about 41,000 and one athlete entered, the semblance 
of having as many fans as Brazil, whose contingent stretched the 
length of the football field. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletes from Trinidad &AMP; Tobago excitedly broke from their  
comrades to snap photos with Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers 
guarding the dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd roared for Cuba, whose athletes marched into Winnipeg  
in black tie, and loved Jamaica, Mexico and the United States. The 
biggest cheers were saved, of course, for the Canadian team, which 
marched in to a standing ovation and blinding bursts of flashbulbs 
from throughout the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	Two groups of Canadian athletes, unable to wait for the parade  
of their countrymen to pass, broke off from the pack to run with 
their flag around the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Dancers recreating a flock of snowbirds kicked off the  
ceremonies, followed by a parade of dignitaries, including Princess 
Anne, International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio 
Samaranch and Mario Vazquez Rana, the president of the Pan American 
Sports Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Rana attempted to offer a few words to open the games, but was  
thwarted by athletes doing the wave, setting off a joyous chain 
reaction throughout the stadium that stalled his remarks for five 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	As a finale to the production numbers, the spectators waived  
gold sheets of tinfoil, a sparkling gesture to honor the color of 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3,400-person event was a mix of music, dance and local  
traditions and featured the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra, the Royal 
Winnipeg Ballet, a 250-piece pipe and drum band and 500 performers 
from 28 cultural groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside Winnipeg Stadium before the ceremony, of members of  
Canadian aboriginal groups protested what their leaders described 
as systematic human rights violations by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a protest against the Pan Am Games or the athletes,''  
said Terry Nelson, a native activist. ``We don't want them to leave 
with the impression that every thing is great here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson accused local officials of attempting to hide the  
province's racial tensions in an effort to portray the Games 
positively. But he praised the efforts of the organizing committee 
to honor Courchene and the other athletes left standing outside the 
stadium gates in 1967.

<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Unaware that his microphone was on,  
an Orlando TV anchor called Hillary Rodham Clinton an ``old battle 
ax'' as he broadcast her arrival at the Kennedy Space Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just moments ago the first lady rolled in,'' WFTV anchor Steve  
Rondinaro said Wednesday night. ``There she comes, the old battle 
ax. There she is with Chelsea in tow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rondinaro apparently wasn't aware that his microphone was still  
on as WFTV received NASA's video feed of the Clintons' arrival to 
watch the space shuttle Columbia launch. 
</P>
<P>
	Rondinaro apologized on the air within minutes, calling it ``an  
offhand, flippant comment that slipped out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Please rest assured that I have the highest respect for the  
first lady and her role and am very pleased to see that Mrs. 
Clinton saw this launch as important enough to make a return 
visit,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	WFTV news director Mike Rausch said the remarks were  
inappropriate and inexcusable. But no disciplinary action will be 
taken against Rondinaro, who is leaving the station next month to 
run two radio stations in North Carolina.

<HEADLINE> Many in U.S. Will Prepare for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Almost one-third of Americans, anticipating  
problems from the Y2K computer bug, plan to stock up on food, water 
and other supplies, and one-quarter of the population will take 
extra money out of the bank, an Associated Press poll found. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Americans -- 66 percent -- expect only minor problems when  
computer programs try to deal with the new millennium, but many are 
joining Julie Alexander in playing it safe. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I might keep my shelves better stocked,'' said the  
woman from Strafford, Mo., among the 31 percent planning to set 
aside provisions. ``We probably will have extra cash on hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Don Haynes, an Elmira, N.Y., construction worker, plans to be  
even more cautious with his money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to leave the minimum in the bank to keep the account  
open,'' Haynes said. ``When I get my first statement in January of 
2000, I will say, 'OK, I guess I'm going to trust you guys' and put 
it back in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The poll of 1,008 adults, conducted for the AP by ICR of Media,  
Pa., found that women (38 percent) were much more likely than men 
(23 percent) to stock up on supplies. In addition, 42 percent of 
blacks planned to take precautions, compared with 29 percent of all 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government has been working to fix potential Y2K  
problems in its computers and advising state and local governments 
and private businesses to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
	Without fixes, many computers -- originally programmed to  
recognize only the last two digits of a year -- will not work 
properly beginning Jan. 1, 2000, when those machines will assume it 
is 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, 66 percent said they expected the Y2K bug would cause  
only minor problems in the United States and 18 percent thought 
there would be no problems at all, while 11 percent expected major 
problems. People 65 years old and older were twice as likely as 
those under 35 to expect no problems from the computer glitch, with 
about one-fifth of the older Americans saying there would be no 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	While a majority didn't expect the problems to be serious, there  
was widespread belief they would be pesky. Thirty percent said they 
expected Y2K problems would last for a week or two at the start of 
the year, while another 32 percent said the problems would persist 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Fears about the banking system may not be warranted because that  
is one business that has worked hard to prepare, said a government 
expert on the Y2K bug. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're confident about any industry, we're confident about  
the banking industry,'' said John Koskinen, chairman of the 
President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the poll found three out of 10 respondents said banks  
would be most at risk because of the Y2K bug. Nearly as many said 
they believed the power supply would be the most at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	'' I expect in the year 2000 ... computers are going to be a  
little haywire,'' said 46-year-old Rosalinda Tostado, a Chicago 
health clinic administrator. ``We work with a lot of computers and 
we always have problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At her clinic, the staff is preparing to dispense medicine and  
keep records by hand rather than relying on computers at the start 
of the year, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	But for 68-year-old housewife Sarah O'Farrell of Montgomery,  
Ala., the publicity about Y2K seems exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is preparing for it,'' she said. ``But I don't think  
it will have too much effect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. O'Farrell says she doesn't use computers and ``doesn't  
intend to because I have a brain,'' though her daughter has a 
degree in computer science and her grandchildren use them. 
</P>
<P>
	The experts say it's prudent to be prepared for some problems,  
even if they aren't major. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think there will be significant failures in the  
national infrastructure,'' Koskinen said. ``The power grids look 
like they will hold, telecommunications nationally will function 
... and the Federal Aviation Administration is announcing that 
they're done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said it's harder to tell what will happen locally.  
</P>
<P>
	The telephone poll was taken July 16-21 and has an error margin  
of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Kaiser Aluminum, Union To Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- Kaiser Aluminum Corp. and the United  
Steelworkers will resume negotiations early next month to end a 
10-month labor dispute that has idled 3,000 workers and financially 
battered the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The parties are to meet Aug. 2-3 and Aug. 9-13 in Denver, and  
Aug. 23-26 in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The company -- operating with management personnel and  
replacement workers -- has reported losses in the three quarters 
since steelworkers walked off their jobs last Sept. 30 at three 
Washington state operations and at plants in Gramercy, La., and 
Newark, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaiser asked the union to return to table, and the union agreed  
to the three rounds of talks. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also asked that its final offer be submitted to  
union members for a vote when the talks are over. 
</P>
<P>
	The union would make no promises in advance, saying no offer  
will be submitted to the rank-and-file without the approval of the 
presidents of five locals involved. 
</P>
<P>
	The strike last fall came over pay, benefits and job security.  
</P>
<P>
	A lockout began Jan. 13, when company officials rejected a union  
offer to return to work while contract negotiations continued. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the nation's fifth-largest aluminum company  
reported a second-quarter loss of $15.7 million, less than half the 
fourth- and first-quarter shortfalls of $38.9 million and $38.2 
million, repectively. 
</P>
<P>
	The impasse involves 2,100 steelworkers at the Spokane-area  
Trentwood and Mead plants, about 300 at Tacoma, and about 600 in 
Louisiana and Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Union officials say they want to preserve seniority and  
job-security protections, and also want higher pay and benefits to 
reflect those of other industry workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaiser negotiators say the company cannot meet the union demands  
and stay competitive.

<HEADLINE> South Korea To Break Up Daewoo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Credit banks will start breaking up  
South Korea's debt-ridden Daewoo conglomerate in August, the 
government's top financial regulator said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo, South Korea's second-largest conglomerate, narrowly  
escaped becoming South Korea's largest-ever bankruptcy this week 
when its creditors agreed to delay repayment of $8.3 billion in 
short-term debt for six months and extend $3.3 billion in new 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
	But doubts persisted over Daewoo's commitment -- and ability -- to  
unload most of its 40 subsidiaries within six months to overcome 
its severe cash strains. 
</P>
<P>
	As such concern spread, Korean stock prices plunged today,  
sending a key indicator down 7.3 percent in the third largest daily 
drop in the history of the Korean Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline fueled fears that Daewoo's trouble could drag down  
the nation's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Hun-jai, head of the government's Financial Supervisory  
Commission, hurriedly convened a news conference and said the 
government will force credit banks to start selling $8.42 billion 
of Daewoo stock and real estate the conglomerate put up as 
collateral, including chairman Kim Woo-choong's personal stock 
worth $1.04 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Such a move will help dispel market uncertainty. We will  
continue to work to make it easier to sell or spin off Daewoo 
unites,'' Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sales will begin in August, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Beginning in the fourth quarter of this year, credit banks will  
also convert unpaid loans into equity to lower Daewoo's debt amount 
and make its subsidiaries more attractive for sale, Lee said. 
Daewoo has an estimated $50 billion in debt against $65 billion in 
total assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar steps will be taken to help restructure four other major  
conglomerates, including Hyundai, Samsung, LG and SK, Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, interest rates soared as banks and financing  
institutions hurried to put together a $3.3 billion emergency loan 
package for Daewoo by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on bellwether three-year corporate bonds rose sharply  
to 9.5 percent from Thursday's 9.08 percent. The indicator reflects 
the average of yields on bonds issued by financially sound 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are doubts on whether Daewoo Group will be able to  
successful carry out its reform plans and resolve its current 
troubles,'' said Yun Sam-wee, an analyst at LG Securities Co. 
``People will remain skeptical until the group takes firm steps to 
sell some of its profitable units.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Daewoo units suffered the biggest losses Friday. Its  
flagship trading arm, Daewoo Corp., plunged by the day's limit of 
15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	President Kim Dae-jung is urging the bloated conglomerates to  
slim down. While other conglomerates were selling assets and 
focusing on profitability, Daewoo continued to expand.

<HEADLINE> Yosemite Naturalist Found Beheaded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) -- A Yosemite naturalist was  
found beheaded along a stream near her home in a remote part of the 
park, and the FBI was searching a large area for clues Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rangers found the body of Joie Ruth Armstrong, 26, on Thursday a  
few hundred yards from the park housing she shared with two people 
who were away on business at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	She was found just a few miles from El Portal, the town where  
three sightseers were last seen a month before their bodies were 
found in March. No charges have been filed in those slayings, and 
an FBI task force and federal grand jury investigating that case 
have said they are confident that most of those responsible are 
behind bars on unrelated charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have absolutely no reason to believe there is a  
connection'' between the two cases, said FBI agent James Maddock. 
</P>
<P>
	However, workers at Cedar Lodge, the motel-restaurant where the  
three sightseers were last seen, said Friday that FBI agents were 
asking about a maintenance worker who failed to show up for work. 
The man apparently did not work at the lodge when the three women 
were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities began searching after Ms. Armstrong was reported  
missing by a woman she was supposed to visit in Sausalito, just 
north of San Francisco. Ms. Armstrong's loaded car was found 
outside her quarters, ready for the trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddock said Friday ``a large, very large'' area was being  
carefully searched for clues, and a number of people were being 
questioned. The FBI is assisting in the investigation because the 
park is federal property. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Armstrong worked at the Yosemite Institute, a nonprofit  
group that runs education programs through a partnership with the 
park service. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have nothing but accolades for Joie,'' said John  
Carlstroem, executive director of the Headlands Institute, the 
Yosemite Institute's sister campus, his voice choking with emotion. 
``She was one of the finest naturalists and science teachers I ever 
met.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carlstroem, who described her as ``wiry, red-haired and full of  
enthusiasm,'' said she loved children and teaching, especially when 
she was ``connecting young people with nature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are going to be a lot of sad kids when they find out  
she's gone,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Park spokesman Kendell Thompson said the last murder in the park  
he could remember was a dozen years ago, when a husband pushed his 
wife off a cliff. He said such incidents draw so much attention 
precisely because they are so rare, pointing out that the park 
averages about 4 million visitors a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We get one incident in 12 years,'' said Suzette Prue, a  
co-worker of Armstrong's who took a hike alone Friday. ``I feel 
really safe here.''

<HEADLINE> Expert on Con Artists Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A man who wrote a book about how to avoid  
being conned and was interviewed on network TV as a 
fraud-prevention expert was arrested Friday after allegedly 
scamming a retired man out of $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Robert Comisar, 38, was being held without bail. He was  
indicted on fraud charges Thursday and could face 80 years in 
prison if convicted of all counts. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Tom Warren said Comisar, using the name David Crane,  
solicited up to $125,000 from a retired engineer by phone and said 
the money would be invested in foreign casinos and a TV quiz show 
on sports. 
</P>
<P>
	When the engineer raised questions, Comisar repaid him $25,000,  
Warren said. Comisar allegedly spent the rest on personal items. 
</P>
<P>
	Comisar was on probation for previous telemarketing frauds. In  
1991 he was convicted of offering investments on what he claimed 
were surefire bets on longshot horses. In 1994 he was convicted for 
offering investments in phony oil wells. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the name Brett Champion, he wrote a book, ``America's  
Guide to Fraud Prevention,'' and dedicated it to U.S. District 
Judge Manuel Real, who presided over the 1991 case and has 
supervised Comisar's probation. 
</P>
<P>
	As Champion, Comisar also appeared on ``Dateline NBC'' segments  
as a former con artist with advice on how to avoid being defrauded. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of the show did not immediately return a call  
seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Brothers Cheat in S. Africa Marathon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- Two brothers passing  
themselves off as the same man were caught cheating in a 
long-distance race after a newspaper published photos showing them 
wearing watches on opposite wrists. 
</P>
<P>
	The photographs showed Sergio Motsoeneng and his brother running  
in the 54-mile Comrades Marathon. Both wore the same number and the 
same hat and shorts. 
</P>
<P>
	But the photos, printed in Beld newspaper, showed their  
wristwatches were on different arms, and one brother had a scar on 
his shin. 
</P>
<P>
	Motsoeneng said through a lawyer on Wednesday that his actions  
in last month's race were those of a desperate man from a poor 
family, the South African Press Association reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Motsoeneng -- a past Comrades gold medalist -- took ninth place  
and a $960 prize. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a very tragic situation,'' lawyer Clem Harrington was  
quoted by SAPA as saying. ``He has asked South Africa to forgive 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sergio Motsoeneng ran the first 45 minutes to a mobile toilet,  
where he exchanged vests and shoes with his younger brother, Fika. 
They made a second swap later in the race, and Sergio finished the 
race, Harrington explained. 
</P>
<P>
	The race was run downhill from Pietermaritzburg to Durban this  
year. In alternate years the race is run in the reverse direction. 
</P>
<P>
	It was first run in 1921 and draws more than 10,000 runners  
every year. First prize is $200,000.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Fines Co. Over Blood Needles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- State health officials have fined  
SmithKline Beecham Clinical Laboratories $102,000 for violations 
connected to a former worker who reused needles to draw patients' 
blood. 
</P>
<P>
	Elaine Giorgi admitted she reused needles on as many as 10  
patients at a Palo Alto clinic. She was also found to have mixed 
serum samples from two patients and mislabeled specimens, the state 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials warned 15,600 people who had blood drawn at clinics  
where Ms. Giorgi worked that they could have been exposed to HIV or 
hepatitis. 
</P>
<P>
	SmithKline Beecham, which has 15 days to appeal, released a  
statement Thursday calling the penalty unfair. The company said it 
had brought the problem to state officials' attention, fired Ms. 
Giorgi in March, notified patients and provided them free testing 
and counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of patients have been tested, but officials have not  
divulged results. However, one lawsuit against the company alleges 
that a woman developed hepatitis C after Ms. Giorgi drew her blood.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 53.19; Nasdaq Down 0.36 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell for the second straight day on  
concerns that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates again 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 53.19 at 10,916.03, adding to Thursday's 33-point drop. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also mostly lower. The Nasdaq  
composite index, which fell 77 points on Thursday, was down 0.36 at 
2,684.08, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was off 5.38 at 
1,355.59. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors began selling Thursday, sending the Dow industrials  
down more than 100 points in morning trading, after Fed Chairman 
Alan Greenspan told Congress the central bank would ``act promptly 
and forcefully'' at the first hint of inflation pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Fed raised interest rates last month in a bid to stave  
off inflation, stocks have rallied to new records and there have 
been few signs of rising inflation. Analysts believed the Fed would 
not raise rates again soon, but Greenspan's testimony on Thursday 
put that outlook in question. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial services stocks slumped on fears of higher interest  
rates. J.P. Morgan was down 3 7/16 at 132 7/8 and Merrill Lynch was 
off 2 11/16 at 71 5/16. Those businesses are generally the first to 
suffer from rate increases, because clients postpone borrowing in 
light of the higher costs. 
</P>

	The threat of higher rates also sent bond prices plummeting on

	``After Greenspan's speech, many believe that the Fed may be  
more aggressive than expected,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior vice 
president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. ``The fear of higher interest rates

	Among the positive earnings news today was a report from Sun  
Microsystems, which said its fourth-quarter profit grew a 
better-than-expected 30 percent. Sun's stock was up 2 7/8 to 70 1/16.

reported a 47 percent increase in second-quarter earnings.

	Tax Cut Debate Shifts to Senate  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The fight over what to do with expected huge  
budget surpluses shifted to the Senate after the House passed a 
$792 billion tax-cutting plan. One House Republican leader said the 
hard-won victory showed the GOP was determined to send money and 
power ``back to the people.'' The Senate bill, like the House 
version, would cut taxes by about $792 billion over 10 years. But 
it does not include the House's 10 percent across-the-board income 
tax cut, which was approved yesterday, nor does it repeal estate 
taxes or cut capital gains taxes. It does address the marriage 
penalty paid by many two-income couples and modifies the 
alternative minimum tax, but in different ways than the House.

	Greenspan Hints at Future Rate Hike  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even after 12 years in the job, Federal  
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is proving once again that he 
hasn't lost the ability to surprise. The nation's top moneyman, in 
a midyear report to Congress Thursday on the state of the economy, 
delivered what some economists viewed as a stern message and a 
possible signal that the Fed is likely to raise interest rates 
again before the year is out. While Greenspan declared that the 
U.S. economy is enjoying an ``exceptional year'' with almost 1.25 
million jobs being created and no increase yet in consumer prices, 
he also pledged to move ``promptly and forcefully'' to raise 
interest rates should inflation flare up. ``It is imperative that 
we do not become complacent,'' Greenspan told the House Banking 
Committee.

	Compaq Names Unknown Manager CEO

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Compaq Computer Corp. prompted surprise and some  
wariness from industry analysts by picking a relative unknown 
manager -- its own chief operating officer of less than two months -- 
to try to turn around the sprawling computer company's flagging 
fortunes. Michael Capellas, 44, previously was Compaq's chief 
technology officer, and has served as a sales manager at software 
maker Oracle Corp. Compaq's board approved the choice on Thursday, 
trying to plug a big management hole that threatened to further 
hurt shrinking sales and profits. Wall Street generally had 
expected Compaq to pick an outside executive with seasoned 
experience in running a major company.

not release the vote count Thursday. Under the deal, 16,000 union

projected industry wage standard by summer 2001. The contract takes

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan shook

inflation dangers. In a volatile session on Wall Street, the Dow 
Jones industrial average fell 33.56 to close at 10,969.22. The 
index plunged as Greenspan began his remarks, and trading remained 
turbulent as Wall Street debated the impact of his testimony. At 
one point, the Dow dipped more than 100 points from Wednesday's 
close. The Nasdaq composite index was dragged lower by steep losses 
in technology stocks, closing down 77.33 at 2,684.44. The Standard

<HEADLINE> 400 Delegates at Reform Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, the Reform  
Party's biggest star, told 400 delegates at the party's convention 
Friday night to keep acting like ``bulldogs'' as they try to 
increase their influence. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, the highest-ranking Reform Party official in the  
nation, canceled his appearance at the convention after 
thunderstorms in Detroit delayed his flight in Minneapolis. He 
addressed the delegates by phone instead. 
</P>
<P>
	``The strength of our party is that we are made up of  
individuals. It is not a group of people who are forced to march to 
the party line,'' he said. ``Party politics has a funny way of 
destroying common sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura urged the delegates to vote and consider every election  
important, reminding them that the Reform Party is less than 10 
years old and must still be built. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're like bulldogs, if we dig in with a never-say-quit  
attitude, we can be a success,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura also denied rumors that he wants to run for the  
presidency in 2000, saying he is obligated to finish his term as 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will not run as a national candidate because I want to keep  
my integrity,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura's supporters turned out in force for the convention,  
waving signs and wearing T-shirts with his likeness. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like him because he's straightforward. You always know where  
he stands,'' said Stephen Proctor, 39, who runs Minnesota's Reform 
Party Web site. ``I'm a reformed Republican. I guess I got tired of 
the straight ticket thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before Ventura spoke, the conventioneers were brought to their  
feet by Doris Haddock, 89, who is walking across the country to 
promote campaign finance reform. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is my belief that every American should be able to run for  
public office without having to sell his soul or her soul to the 
corporations or the unions in order to become a candidate,'' said 
Ms. Haddock, who started at the Pacific Ocean and has walked 1,800 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
	The convention could bring some change within the party. Among  
those running for party chairman -- a race that will be decided 
Sunday -- is Jack Gargan, a Ventura ally who vows to move the party 
away from Dallas and party founder Ross Perot. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura and Gargan are opposed to another presidential run by  
Perot, who lost elections in 1992 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Perot is scheduled to speak Saturday evening.

<HEADLINE> Senate Passes Hate-Crime Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is calling on the House to  
mimic the Senate's passage of legislation expanding the 
government's power to pursue perpetrators of hate crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Without debate or even public mention of what it was doing, the  
Senate used a voice vote late Thursday to approve legislation 
adding sexual orientation, gender and disability to the categories 
of people protected under federal hate-crime law. Currently, the 
law only covers race, color, religion or national origin. 
</P>
<P>
	``I call on the House of Representatives to meet its  
responsibility in combating violence that is fueled by hate,'' 
Clinton said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have some distance to go before the Hate Crimes Prevention  
Act is the law of the land, but tonight's action by the Senate is a 
big step forward in the journey toward greater protection for all 
Americans,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure was sponsored by Sens. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,  
Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and about three dozen other Democrats and 
moderate Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar bill died in Congress last year, but momentum has  
grown after a spate of incidents. These include the dragging death 
of a black man in Texas, the fatal beating of a gay college student 
in Wyoming and this month's shooting spree in Illinois and Indiana 
by a man police said was a member of a white supremacist group. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tremendous victory,'' said David Smith, spokesman for  
the Human Rights Campaign, a gay-rights political group. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics -- largely conservatives -- have said hate-crimes  
legislation creates special classes of citizens who are already 
protected by state laws against violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Also approved was a second, narrower bill by Sen. Orrin Hatch,  
R-Utah, that would expand federal jurisdiction to hate crimes 
committed after the crossing of state lines. It would also allow 
federal aid to state and local law enforcement officials 
prosecuting hate crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	It would not expand coverage beyond crimes based on race, color,  
religion or national origin, which are already covered by federal 
hate crime law. 
</P>
<P>
	The two hate-crimes measures were among 34 amendments the Senate  
--without describing them -- added on a single voice vote to a 
spending bill for the Justice Department and other agencies. The 
spending legislation was also approved by voice vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The ultimate fate of the hate crime language is unclear because  
the House version of the Justice spending bill does not include it. 
A final verdict probably won't be known until fall, when the 
overall spending bill is likely to become part of expected budget 
bargaining between Clinton and lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Under current law, the federal government can prosecute  
hate-motivated violence if the victim was on federal property or 
engaged in a federally protected activity such as going to school. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kennedy bill would expand that to cover any incident related  
to interstate commerce, such as use of a gun made in another state.

<HEADLINE> Colorado Teams To Be Auctioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Retired Denver Broncos quarterback John Elway may  
be about to engineer another of his famous comeback victories, this 
time for the ownership of the NBA's Denver Nuggets and the NHL's 
Colorado Avalanche. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway is in a bidding war with a Saudi Arabian princess, a  
Wal-Mart fortune heiress and possibly other investors to acquire 
the two teams and a new sports arena from Ascent Entertainment 
Group Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway was part of an investment group that submitted a bid for  
the assets earlier this year, but lost out to Bill Laurie and his 
wife, Nancy, an heiress to the Wal-Mart fortune. 
</P>
<P>
	However, company officials have given Elway and others a second  
chance to bid on the two professional sports teams as part of an 
agreement with unhappy shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	The company plans to sell the assets in an open auction  
Wednesday, selecting the highest bid from among those submitted by 
Friday's deadline to compete against the Lauries, who have offered 
$400 million for Ascent, but are willing to increase their offer. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, Princess Thara Al Saud joined the race and Elway,  
along with two partners, submitted a fresh bid. Dollar figures on 
the bids were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway and his partners are ``putting together an offer to make a  
bid for Ascent,'' said Jeff Sperbeck, Elway's business manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``The princess is very serious about this acquisition and her  
financial resources are available for a full and serious 
commitment,'' said Valerian Butler Smith III, chairman of New 
York-based Ashland Capital Holdings and the princess' principal 
investment manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Pete Webb, a spokesman for the Lauries, said, ``The Lauries'  
position remains unchanged. They are focused on seeing the process 
through to the final outcome and they expect to prevail. 
</P>
<P>
	``They continue to believe they are the best purchasers of the  
sports businesses and the best purchasers for Denver,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials declined comment Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	The unusual method for selling the National Hockey League's  
Avalanche, the National Basketball Association's Nuggets and the 
Pepsi Center, due to open this fall, was devised after shareholders 
criticized Ascent's plan to sell the assets to the Lauries for $400 
million in March. Shareholders claimed the assets should have 
fetched a higher price. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders filed two lawsuits, and a third was filed by two  
businessmen who contended the Lauries backed out of an agreement to 
sell the Avalanche for $80 million to them. 
</P>
<P>
	In late June, Ascent officials bowed to pressure and nixed the  
deal with the Lauries. They agreed to settle the lawsuits by 
calling for an open auction after reopening the bidding process. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said Princess Al Saud, the widow of Prince Mohammed Abdul  
Aziz, a nephew of King Fahd who died in a plane crash 23 years ago, 
spoke with Nuggets general manager Dan Issel and Avalanche general 
manager Pierre LaCroix this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Princess Al Saud also met with representatives of former Chicago  
Bulls basketball star Michael Jordan in an attempt to interest him 
in investing in her bid, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But she is not relying on any outside investors for this  
process,'' said Smith. ``Obviously Mr. Jordan represents positive 
factors beyond money in a project such as this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Falk, Jordan's agent, said Thursday that reports Jordan  
might join the princess' bid are ``factually incorrect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway, who is known for spearheading come-from-behind victories  
during his years with the Denver Broncos, is teaming with Denver 
financier Lars Erik Borgen and Colorado ski mogul George Gillett. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other investment groups, headed by Colorado banker Donald  
Sturm, whose earlier bid for Ascent was rebuffed, and Snapple 
beverage magnate Nelson Peltz, would not disclose whether they were 
among the bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the legal settlement, the Lauries will be allowed to  
purchase the company's sports assets for the original $400 million 
if a higher bid is not received. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also has also agreed to reimburse the Lauries $5  
million for their expenses and to pay the Lauries a termination fee 
in certain circumstances in the event that they do not succeed in 
the auction.

<HEADLINE> Eastwind Airlines Suspends Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Eastwind Airlines, a low-fare carrier  
scrutinized after complaints of poor service from passengers, has 
suspended flights to and from Boston, Pittsburgh and St. 
Petersburg, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	A news release from the St. Petersburg-Clearwater International  
Airport announced Eastwind's indefinite suspension to the cities 
was caused by ``unforeseen business circumstances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greensboro-based Eastwind also had been flying into Boston's  
Logan Airport and Pittsburgh International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eastwind hopes to renew services to these locations within  
three to six months,'' the release said. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement said Eastwind would continue to fly in and out of  
Orlando, Fla., Philadelphia and Greensboro. Eastwind also flies to 
Trenton, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Eastwind officials did not immediately return phone calls Friday  
seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The company Web site's online reservation service Friday  
provided the four cities as the only flight destination options for 
travelers. An operator at the airline's telephone reservation 
center said ticketholders to affected destinations were notified 
beginning Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Eastwind announced just two weeks ago it would launch daily  
roundtrip service to St. Petersburg as of July 15. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has been criticized in recent months for poor  
service sparked by hours-long delays and complaints about delayed 
billing. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline officials attributed its past problems to growing pains  
with an expanded flight schedule and new computer and telephone 
reservation systems.

<HEADLINE> Ruling in Parachutist-Plane Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- A skydiver who collided with an  
airplane, breaking his foot and causing a crash that killed four 
people, was awarded $180,000 by a judge who said air traffic 
controllers were partly to blame. 
</P>
<P>
	Parachutist Alfred Peters clipped the tail of the small plane in  
1993 during a 7,400-foot jump. The plane plummeted to the ground, 
killing everyone aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Michael Ponsor ruled Thursday that the  
pilot, Elliot Klein, bore most of the fault but that air 
controllers at Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, 
Conn., should have issued a warning when they saw Klein flying into 
an area below Peters' jump plane. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge ordered the federal government to pay $180,000 to  
Peters and $104,000 to an insurance company to partly reimburse it 
for payments made over the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge also said that Klein should not have been flying  
because he had taken medication for depression just before takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Klein, of Rhinebeck, N.Y., and his passengers, including his  
18-year-old son, Jonas, died in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration declined to comment.

<HEADLINE> Doubt Cast on Japan Economy Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's gross domestic product probably shrank in  
the April-June quarter, the government's top economic planner said 
Friday, casting doubt on the nation's fledging economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The value of all goods and services produced in the nation in  
the January-March quarter grew 1.9 percent, but it may have fallen 
since, Economic Planning Agency director-general Taichi Sakaiya 
said. Official data is due in September. 
</P>
<P>
	He repeated concerns that public works spending would slow later  
this year, and said that the government must take measures to 
bolster expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
	The cabinet consensus is that decisions on the size and timing  
of a possible second supplementary budget should be made after the 
second-quarter GDP data is out, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA forecasts a GDP of $4.24 trillion in the fiscal year  
ending March 31, 2000, up 0.5 percent over last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakaiya said the country, buoyed by January-March growth, can  
attain that goal even if the economy contracts 0.2 percent in the 
second through fourth quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan is experiencing its worst recession since World War II.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in an economic forecast released Friday, brokerage  
Nikko Salomon Smith Barney said Japan's infaltion-adjusted GDP will 
probably shrink 0.3 percent in this fiscal year and grow 1.2 
percent the following year. 
</P>
<P>
	Nikko Salomon had previously forecast a 0.9 percent GDP decline  
this fiscal year and 0.8 percent growth in the year after. 
</P>
<P>
	Likely additional government spending and the Bank of Japan's  
easy monetary policy will support the economy in the medium term, 
while improvement in the job market and corporate restructuring 
will later contribute to a recovery, Nikko Salomon said.

<HEADLINE> Huskies Coach Without a Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Rick Neuheisel, who was hired as the University  
of Washington's football coach in January, still doesn't have a 
signed contract more than six months after he was hired. 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel left the University of Colorado to come to Seattle  
after Jim Lambright was fired following the Huskies' 6-6 season. 
Athletic director Barbara Hedges lured the coach to Washington for 
about $1 million a season. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the major sticking points to the signing apparently is  
making the contract conform with a ruling by the state's Executive 
Ethics Board. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, the board ruled that outside compensation paid to  
Lambright -- by companies such as Nike and Wilson Sporting Goods -- 
violated the 1995 ethics law for state employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The university agreed to a settlement under which it repaid the  
investigative costs of $9,500, and the board issued a set of 
guidelines for future contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Hedges said that trying to structure Neuheisel's contract to  
comply with those guidelines has slowed the process. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rick's and my goal was to have this contract signed before the  
start of football season and we are going to do that,'' she said. 
``It isn't that there were any real major issues. These things just 
tend to take time.''

<HEADLINE> Thorn Apple Valley Meat Firm Sold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Troubled meat processor Thorn Apple Valley has  
been sold to one of the country's largest meatpackers as part of a 
bankruptcy plan. 
</P>
<P>
	IBP Inc., which has moved its headquarters to Dakota Dunes,  
S.D., from Dakota City, Neb., is buying the company for $115 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale was approved Thursday by Judge Ray Reynolds Graves in  
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Detroit. He ruled that all proceeds will 
go to secured creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	Unsecured creditors, such as the City of Detroit, which is owed  
about $6.5 million in back taxes and utilities, are unlikely to be 
paid, the Detroit Free Press reported Friday. Thorn Apple Valley 
had owed all its creditors about $182 million. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the meatpacker's second offer for the Southfield firm. In  
June, Thorn Apple Valley announced it planned to sell to IBP for 
$112 million. But Excel Corp. of Wichita, Kan. then offered $114 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Thorn Apple Valley President Joel Dorfman, who declined to  
comment Thursday, said previously that the company would continue 
to operate under the Thorn Apple Valley logo, and employees would 
keep their jobs. The company has about 3,100 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The company was founded by Dorfman's father, Henry Dorfman, who  
started with one plant in 1952 in Detroit's Eastern Market. It made 
hot dogs, luncheon meats and smoked sausages, and maintained a 
slaughterhouse in the market until last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Thorn Apple Valley had endured years of losses. But after the  
costly January recall of 30 million pounds of meat, and a quarterly 
loss of $19.2 million, it sought protection from creditors under 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall of meat potentially contaminated with poisonous  
listeria bacteria triggered the fall. Lost production and sales 
cost about $5.1 million. No illnesses were linked to the meat, 
which was processed in Arkansas.

<HEADLINE> Mets Get Kenny Rogers From A's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Mets, searching for pitching help  
for the stretch run, acquired Kenny Rogers from the Oakland 
Athletics today for a pair of minor leaguers, The Associated Press 
has learned. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was scheduled to be announced at 4 p.m. EDT.  
</P>
<P>
	Rogers, a 34-year-old left-hander, was 5-3 with a 4.30 ERA in 19  
starts for the A's this season. His career record is 109-77 in 11 
seasons with Texas, the New York Yankees and Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for Rogers, the Mets are sending Oakland 23-year-old  
outfielder Terrence Long and another minor leaguer, according to a 
baseball executive who spoke on the condition he not be identified. 
The other player may be 26-year-old left-hander Leo Vasquez, the 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers made his major league debut in 1989 with Texas, then  
managed by Bobby Valentine, the current manager of the Mets. Rogers 
pitched for the Rangers under Valentine from 1989-92 and threw a 
perfect game for Texas against California on July 28, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	He is making $5 million this season, the last guaranteed season  
of a $20 million, four-year contract he signed with the Yankees in 
December 1995. The Mets, who began Friday two games behind Atlanta 
in the NL East and one game ahead of Cincinnati in the wild-card 
race, acquire a $5 million option for next year that would become 
guaranteed if he pitches 42 more innings this season. 
</P>
<P>
	He had an unhappy time during his two years with the Yankees,  
going 18-15. He was traded to Oakland for Scott Brosius in November 
1997, with New York agreeing to pay $2.5 million of Rogers' salary 
in both 1998 and '99. 
</P>
<P>
	While Rogers was 12-8 with a 4.68 ERA as the Yankees won the  
World Series in 1996, he slumped to 6-7 with a 5.65 ERA the 
following year and was left off the postseason roster. During his 
first season with the Yankees, he was hit on his pitching shoulder 
by a line drive and threatened with demotion to the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	Long is hitting .326 this season with seven homers, 47 RBIs and  
14 steals in 78 at Triple-A Norfolk. He had three at-bats for the 
Mets this year, striking out twice and grounding into a double 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	Vasquez is 1-2 with a 3.83 ERA and one save in 27 relief  
appearances at Double-A Binghamton. He has 43 strikeouts in 42 1-3 
innings.

<HEADLINE> More Evacuated in Iowa From Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CEDAR FALLS, Iowa (AP) -- About 100 people were forced out of  
their homes Friday as the Cedar River rose to record levels. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh heck, you can't cry your eyes out about it,'' said Kenneth  
Wood, who has lived in a riverside neighborhood since 1936. ``After 
that many years living along the river, you know you're going to 
get water.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many people in Wood's neighborhood had to use aluminum motor  
boats to make their way around submerged trees and street signs to 
check on their houses. One resident had posted a sign that read: 
``Lake Shore Property. This week only!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, no injuries were reported, and Jeff Olson, deputy  
director of public safety, declared: ``The worst is over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, the town of Waverly, which is upriver from  
Cedar Falls, was cut in two as the river crested 2 feet higher than 
the previous record set in 1993. About 1,500 people were evacuated 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The area was also flooded three weeks ago, when 200 homes were  
damaged and a man died while trying to cross a swollen creek.

<HEADLINE> Oliver Miller Tries Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Some 50 pounds lighter than he was just a few  
months ago, Oliver Miller is back in the arena where he was 
ridiculed last February. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very confident. It's all up to me,'' Miller said after  
going through his first workout Friday in the rookie-free agent 
camp of the Phoenix Suns, the team that drafted him seven years 
ago. ``I told myself, `Hey, it's time for you to get yourself in 
shape, lose the weight, get stronger, get quicker, and I did 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He went on a strict nutrition-based diet and worked out twice a  
day over the past few months. As a result, Miller weighed in at 318 
pounds as the camp began, and he figured he sweated off a few more 
in that first workout. He said it's the least he's weighed in four 
or five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller said he has weighed as much as 365 pounds. He looked at  
least that big last Feb. 9, when he accompanied the Sacramento 
Kings to Phoenix. He was stunned when the Suns' mascot, the 
Gorilla, did a skit making fun of his weight. The crowd howled in 
laughter, and Miller was devastated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Looking at the Gorilla made me think, `Do I really look like  
that? Do I come across to people being that big and that out of 
shape?''' Miller said. ``I told myself it's time to do something 
about it, and that's what I'm doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller played in just four games for Sacramento, his fifth team  
in seven NBA seasons. He spent most of the season on the injured 
list. Back spasms were the official reason, but his weight problem 
was the more obvious one. 
</P>
<P>
	His agent filed a grievance over the Gorilla skit and talked  
about suing the Suns. Miller said Friday that the fuss was all his 
agent's doing, but he said he appreciated it when Suns coach Danny 
Ainge apologized. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have any hard feelings toward this organization,''  
Miller said. ``Danny came up to me in Sacramento and apologized. 
That meant a lot to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harder to reconcile for Suns owner Jerry Colangelo was Miller's  
off-court carousing during his two seasons with Phoenix. Miller 
helped the Suns reach the NBA Finals as a rookie in 1993, but left 
the team the following year, departing with some bitter, critical 
remarks about the Suns' organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was young. I was immature. I made stupid decisions, stupid  
choices,'' Miller said. ``I regret everything I said back then, but 
it's a new day, a new year, and I'll just move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo said that when his son, general manager Bryan  
Colangelo, and Ainge asked about bringing Miller back, ``My initial 
reaction was no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Colangelo said he looked into how Miller had changed his  
lifestyle, and said OK. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were people who influenced him in a negative way, and  
that's unfortunate,'' Colangelo said. ``He had some success right 
away, and maybe that was too soon because he wasn't equipped to 
handle it. Then he went downhill fast. There are so many cases in 
life where people have to hit bottom before they can truly change 
their ways. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to find out where Oliver is, but what better place  
to give a guy a chance to redeem himself than where it started?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller said Ainge approached him about coming back to Phoenix.  
</P>
<P>
	``That really got me motivated,'' Miller said. ``After  
everything that's happened in the past, if Jerry's willing to give 
me another chance I'm going to jump on that. Like people say, you 
never realize what you have good until it's gone. I didn't realize 
how good this organization and Jerry and the other guys were until 
I left. Now I'm back and I'm going to take advantage of this 
opportunity to stay here. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started my career here and now I want to finish it here.''  
</P>
<P>
	Miller, who turned 29 in April, said he wants to be down to 290  
pounds by the time training camp starts Oct. 4. He'd like to stay 
in the 295-300 range through the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've grown up. I've gone through a lot in these past five  
years,'' he said. ``There's a time in your life when you've got to 
tell yourself you've got to mature, you've got to make the right 
decisions, hang out with the right people and be in the right 
places. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just going to go out and show people that Oliver Miller  
means business. He still loves the game, and he's willing to do 
whatever is possible to win.''

<HEADLINE> Wis. Cites Crash Labor Violations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- A company that employed seven people killed  
during a cross-country sales trek committed 92 labor-law violations 
and could face more than $250,000 in penalties, state officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Department of Workforce Development on Thursday  
accused YES, a De Witt, Iowa-based company that hires young people 
to sell magazine subscriptions, with violating multiple laws, 
including the minimum wage law and employing minors in street 
trades. 
</P>
<P>
	A van carrying 14 YES employees overturned in March on  
Interstate 90, killing seven occupants and seriously injuring five 
others. Police said the van's driver, 20-year-old Jeremy Holmes, 
was trying to switch seats with a passenger because he was caught 
speeding and did not have a valid license. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes was sentenced last month to seven years in prison after  
pleading guilty to vehicular homicide and causing great bodily 
harm. The crash victims were between the ages of 15 and 25. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately these young adults were clearly exploited and  
now the company must pay for their violations,'' Linda Stewart, 
secretary of the Department of Workforce Development, said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	YES owner Choane Lane did not return telephone calls by The  
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin Justice Department spokesman James Haney said the  
state attorney general's office will review the labor law 
citations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not received the referral yet but we look forward to  
reviewing it,'' Haney said, adding the investigation ``is still 
active and ongoing.''

	NEW YORK (AP) -- A memorial Mass for John F. Kennedy Jr. and  
Carolyn Bessette Kennedy was held today in New York and included an 
eclectic mix of readings and music, ranging from Shakespeare to a 
reggae anthem. Reporters were not admitted, but mourners said the 
ceremony, at the Church of St. Thomas More in Manhattan, opened 
with the hymn ``All Creatures of our God and King.'' Hip-hop artist 
Wyclef Jean sang the reggae anthem ``Many Rivers to Cross.'' Ms. 
Kennedy's mother, Ann Freeman, read from Henry Scott Holland's 
meditation ``Facts of Faith.'' The Mass was celebrated by the Rev. 
Charles J. O'Byrne, who married JFK Jr. and Carolyn in 1996 at a

of a heart attack at age 70. He was succeeded by his son, Crown 
Prince Sidi Mohamed. The new monarch described Hassan as ``a great 
leader and one of this world's great men.'' Morocco's new leader, 
36, will be known as King Mohamed VI. He is unmarried and has an 
interest in literature and art. The announcement of Hassan's death 
brought hundreds of crying mourners to the royal palace in the

another man burst into the cockpit, tying up the hijacker with

	State Dept. Says Terror Has Changed  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Today's terrorists find ways to raise their  
own money -- through drug trafficking, for example -- rather than 
rely on direct help from foreign governments, the State 
Department's acting counterterrorism coordinator said today. The 
character of international terrorism has shifted somewhat since 
1980, when Americans were being held hostage in the U.S. Embassy in 
Iran, Michael Sheehan told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
Groups involved in the bombing nearly a year ago of U.S. embassies 
in Kenya and Tanzania, he said, ``are more in the mold of the new 
terrorist threat -- groups that are often self-financed with less 
direct linkage to state sponsors.''

<HEADLINE> Speeds Sizzle at Michigan Speedway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLYN, Mich. (AP) -- Try telling the average guy that driving  
a race car 230 mph is boring. 
</P>
<P>
	No less an authority than Mauricio Gugelmin, the driver who set  
the open-wheel qualifying record of 240.942 mph, said Friday that 
CART's year-old Handford wing, an aerodynamic device that slows the 
cars, is working very well. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I did 240, that was a great number; it was a great  
feeling,'' said Gugelmin, who set the record at California Speedway 
in 1997. ``But to do that all the time is pushing your luck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The winglike device, developed by Swift engineer Mark Handford,  
was used last year in the U.S. 500 at Michigan Speedway and the 
Marlboro 500 in California, and it slowed the cars about 10 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	During Friday's practice session for the fourth U.S. 500, rookie  
sensation Juan Montoya turned the fast lap of 231.258, followed by 
Gugelmin at 230.740 and Max Papis at 230.518. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-five other drivers were within 1 second of Montoya's  
31.134-second lap. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you run on your own, it's almost boring, like running on  
rails,'' Gugelmin said. ``But when you get other cars around you, 
you can have some big surprises, and that's not much fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Andretti, a two-time Michigan winner, doesn't enjoy  
racing at Michigan Speedway, but it's not because of the sizzling 
speeds. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to hold your breath all weekend here,'' said  
Andretti, who was 10th in practice at 228.964. ``The Handford 
Device makes it more like Talladega-type racing. You have to rely 
on drafting more with this wing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that last year's U.S. 500 produced a CART series-record  
62 lead changes, he added, ``Every driver definitely has to respect 
each other here with all the wheel-to-wheel racing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montoya, who came to CART this season from the European Formula  
5000 road-racing series, says it takes a little time to get used to 
the speeds on the 2-mile, high-banked Michigan oval. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty exciting,'' the 23-year-old Colombian said. ``The  
first time I drove here, I did about 40 laps in testing and that 
helped. I actually got a nice rhythm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the two rookies who will race here on Sunday --  
Montoya and Cristiano da Matta of Brazil -- had the track all to 
themselves for the first 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was good because once the other cars got out there,  
everything changed,'' said Montoya, who is the replacement for Alez 
Zanardi, the two-time series champion who is now in Formula One. 
</P>
<P>
	While Gugelmin is with the team for which he set the qualifying  
record, and Montoya is totally new to the big ovals, Papis is in a 
different position -- having moved from a developing team to the 
established Team Rahal. 
</P>
<P>
	That move has pushed him to the top of the speed charts, and  
he's enjoying the feeling. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's completely different from what I have felt in the past,''  
the Italian driver said. ``You really feel the speed when you're 
going into the corners, especially when somebody is backing off 
ahead of you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Papis finished 19th here last year, going out 14 laps from the  
end with an electrical problem. But he said his car was so slow, it 
was embarrassing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Zanardi told me he thought I was running with two cars because  
he was passing me every 15 or 16 laps. I hope it won't be like that 
this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were two incidents during the afternoon practice. Robby  
Gordon spun without hitting the wall and Tony Kanaan, last year's 
top rookie, ending the session when he crashed hard in turn four. 
The Brazilian driver was not injured.

<HEADLINE> Method of Y2K Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Associated Press poll on Y2K issues is based on telephone  
interviews with 1,008 randomly selected adults from all states 
except Alaska and Hawaii. The interviews were conducted July 16-21 
by ICR of Media, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were weighted to represent the population by key  
demographic factors, such as age, sex, region and education. 
</P>
<P>
	No more than one time in 20 should chance variations in the  
sample cause the results to vary by more than 3 percentage points 
from the answers that would be obtained if all Americans were 
polled. 
</P>
<P>
	This margin of sampling error is larger for responses of  
subgroups, such as income categories. There are other sources of 
potential error in polls, including the wording and order of 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP poll questions (because of rounding, sums may not total  
100 percent): 

</P>
<P>
	1. In general, do you expect the Y2K bug to cause ...  
</P>
<P>
	--Major problems in the United States, 11 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--Minor problems in the United States, 66 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--No problems in the United States, 18 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--Don't know, 5 percent.  

</P>
<P>
	2. How long do you think Y2K-related computer problems will  
last? 
</P>
<P>
	--One day or less, 5 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--A few days, 17 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--A week or two, 30 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--More than two weeks, 32 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--No computer problems will occur, 11 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--Don't know, 5 percent.  

</P>
<P>
	3. Some people plan to take extra money out of the bank at the  
end of the year in case computer problems affect banks and cash 
machines. Others say such precautions are not necessary. Do you 
plan to take extra money out of the bank because of the Y2K bug or 
not? 
</P>
<P>
	--Yes, 25 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--No, 69 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--Don't know, 5 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--Refused to answer, 1 percent.  

</P>
<P>
	4. Some people also plan to stock up on such items as food,  
water, gasoline and batteries because of possible Y2K problems. Do 
you plan to stock up or not? 
</P>
<P>
	--Yes, 31 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--No, 67 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--Don't know, 2 percent.  

</P>
<P>
	5. In your opinion, what is most at risk because of the Y2K bug?  
</P>
<P>
	--Banking, financial services, 31 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--Transportation system, 12 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--Power supply, 26 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--Phone system, 6 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--Food distribution, 11 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--Don't know, 13 percent.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Man Sentenced for Dog Fights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A former veterinary technician who  
trained dogs to fight to the death was sentenced Friday to seven 
years in prison. Prosecutors called it the nation's longest animal 
cruelty sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Cesar Cerda, 26, who earned up to $5,000 a month from bettors  
who watched the animals fight in a bloodstained pit, pleaded no 
contest to 63 counts of animal cruelty, torture and other charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to find the toughest penalty out there,'' prosecutor  
Brian Myers said. ``Then we fought hard to make this the toughest 
sentence in the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In December, authorities seized 55 pit bulls from Cerda's home.  
Investigators also found training equipment, including treadmills 
and chains, rule books on dog fighting and medical supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	``He took these dogs to the brink of death and then nursed them  
back to health so they could fight again,'' Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The pit bulls were put to death in May. Shelter officials said  
they were ``unadoptable'' because of their fighting backgrounds.

<HEADLINE> 8-Year Hepatitis C Study Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is launching an eight-year  
study to test anti-viral drug treatments for the 4 million 
Americans infected with chronic hepatitis C. 
</P>
<P>
	Hepatitis C can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer in some  
patients and results in about 1,000 liver transplants annually in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The $28 million clinical trial will be funded by the National  
Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, a division 
of the National Institutes of Health. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers will try to determine if long-term treatment with  
drugs can slow or prevent the progression of liver disease in 
hepatitis C patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The trials will begin next year at nine centers around the  
country, the Institute said. Researchers will decide this summer 
which drugs will be used and the number of volunteers to be 
recruited. 
</P>
<P>
	Blood transfusions and sharing unsterilized needles and syringes  
have been the main causes of the spread of hepatitis C in the 
United States. The disease ranks with alcohol abuse as the most 
common causes of liver disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the largest and longest study of hepatitis C, this trial  
should provide answers to difficult questions concerning management 
of hepatitis C,'' Dr. Jay H. Hoofnagle, director of the division of 
digestive diseases and nutrition, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine trial centers are the University of California, Irvine;  
University of Southern California, Los Angeles; University of 
Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver; Massachusetts General 
Hospital, Boston; University of Massachusetts Medical School, 
Worcester; St. Louis University, St. Louis, Mo.; University of 
Michigan, Ann Arbor; University of Texas Southwestern Medical 
Center, Dallas and Medical College of Virginia, Richmond.

<HEADLINE> Horse Injured in Belmont Paddock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELMONT, N.Y. (AP) -- A horse was fatally injured in a Belmont  
Park paddock on Friday, the second time such an accident has 
occured in the past four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Lanvinity, a four-year-old maiden, flipped over in the walking  
ring prior to the fifth race and incurred fatal injuries to her 
head. 
</P>
<P>
	``She flipped over and hit her head on the ground, right at the  
base of her skull,'' said Dr. Neil A. Cleary, the chief examining 
veterinarian for the New York Racing Association. ``She died as a 
direct result of her injries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diane Nelson, who was to ride the horse, was not injured in the  
incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were just about to give me a leg up when it happened,''  
she said. ``It was terrible''. 
</P>
<P>
	On June 26, another horse, Three Ring, reared up and fell over  
backward, fracturing her skull just prior to the Matron Stakes. She 
was euthanized at the scene.

<HEADLINE> Paper: Pitcher Abbott May Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Jim Abbott, who amazed and inspired baseball  
fans by reaching the major leagues despite having only one hand, 
might have thrown the last pitch of his career, the Milwaukee 
Journal Sentinel reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	An official announcement on Abbott's future with the team and in  
baseball was expected later today, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott did not accompany his teammates to Florida, where the  
Brewers will start a three-game series with the Marlins tonight, 
the newspaper said. As the team packed for the road trip after 
their 5-0 win over Philadelphia Thursday, Abbott accepted best 
wishes from his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad to see him go,'' infielder Mark Loretta said. ``There  
are a lot of guys that you play with that you say you will keep in 
touch with, but you never do. He is one of those guys that you will 
stay in touch with. I know I will. It was great playing with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott left County Stadium without commenting to reporters.  
</P>
<P>
	Brewers general manager Sal Bando and manager Phil Garner both  
declined to comment on Abbott's status with the team, the Journal 
Sentinel said. 
</P>
<P>
	A team source told the newspaper that right-handed reliever  
Reggie Harris (2-2) would join the Brewers from Class Triple-A 
Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott (2-8) gave up three runs in the ninth inning of a 7-0  
loss to Philadelphia on Wednesday, the most recent poor outing of a 
disappointing season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gave it his best shot,'' Loretta said.  
</P>
<P>
	The 31-year-old Abbott, born without a right hand, won a gold  
medal in the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
	After four seasons with the California Angels, he was traded to  
the New York Yankees and pitched a no-hitter against Cleveland on 
Sept. 4, 1993, at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a thrill of a lifetime,'' Abbott recalled Sunday, the  
day David Cone threw a perfect game for the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott opened the 1995 season with the Chicago White Sox and  
later was traded back to the Angels. He posted a 2-18 record during 
the 1996 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Angels released him after a series of shaky starts in spring  
training in 1997. Abbott spent the summer at his Michigan home. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, he signed a minor league deal with the White Sox and  
worked his way through the farm system until reaching the majors, 
where he was 5-0 in the final month of that season. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott signed with the Brewers as a free agent Jan. 27, 1999. He  
had an impressive spring training and began the season as the No. 4 
starter in the Brewers' rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	He also got his first major league hit on June 15 against the  
Chicago Cubs. He spent most of his career in the American League, 
where pitchers don't normally bat. 
</P>
<P>
	After giving up 18 runs in his first three starts, Abbott spent  
the rest of the season bouncing between starting and relieving. 
</P>
<P>
	It was after he allowed five runs in 3 2-3 innings in front of  
friends and family on July 8 at Tiger Stadium, that Abbott said he 
would contemplate his future after the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
	When he came back after the break, he was assigned to the  
bullpen.

<HEADLINE> Judge Criticizes Calif. Grand Jury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The grand jury that accused Mayor Susan Golding  
of misconduct abused its power, ignored the constitution and 
abandoned common sense, a judge ruled in officially dropping the 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
	The 19-member panel accused the mayor of peddling her influence  
and not making committee appointments. Presiding Superior Court 
Judge Wayne Peterson said Thursday the accusations were more an 
indictment of the grand jury than of the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It ignored its statutes. It ignored the case law. It ignored  
the constitution,'' Petersen said. ``In doing so, it has violated 
its public trust and brought discredit to the grand jury process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge ruled the mayor had done nothing illegal, immoral or  
unethical. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no evidence to support what they said,'' Golding  
said at a press conference. ``I don't know what their agenda was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury alleged that Golding offered to support a $4  
million city appropriation to promote tourism in exchange for the 
San Diego Hotel-Motel Association's endorsement of a measure to 
build a new ballpark for the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego County District Attorney Paul Pfingst had filed court  
papers to dismiss the accusations, finding that Golding was 
innocent and the grand jury's investigation was flawed.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls Against the Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen in New York  
Friday as traders scooped up the Japanese currency, which has 
become more attractive amid a brightening outlook for the Japanese 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 116.55  
Japanese yen, down from 116.70 yen late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro slipped slightly against the dollar. In late New York  
trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0503, down from $1.0517. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar fell despite hints from Japanese financial officials  
that they are prepared to intervene to stem the yen's rapid rise 
against the dollar. But the Bank of Japan failed to intervene in 
currency markets Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gains by the yen make Japanese exports more costly abroad, and  
thus less competitive, while reducing the value of foreign revenue 
in yen terms. Japan is struggling to emerge from its worst 
recession in more than 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the Bank of Japan absent from Friday's markets, traders  
bought more yen, which have been in high demand as foreign money 
flows back into Japanese financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.5308 Swiss francs, up from  
1.5245, and 1.5070 Canadian dollars, down from 1.5080. The British 
pound fell to $1.5703 from $1.5845. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Friday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8602 German 
marks, up from 1.8598; 6.2454 French francs, up from 6.2383.

<HEADLINE> 13th Pan American Games Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- The 13th Pan American Games eased into  
existence Friday, opening with a sweep of samba and a relaxed 
parade of athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Waving hats and hands, some 5,000 athletes from 42 countries  
marched into Winnipeg Stadium, including large delegations from the 
United States, Canada, Cuba, Brazil and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest cheers were saved for the Canadians, who marched in  
to a standing ovation and blinding bursts of flashbulbs from 
throughout the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	Dancers recreating a flock of snowbirds kicked off the  
ceremonies, followed by a parade of dignitaries, including Princess 
Anne, International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio 
Samaranch and Mario Vazquez Rana, the president of the Pan American 
Sports Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	For seven aboriginal athletes snubbed three decades ago when  
Canada last staged the games, Friday's opening ceremony represented 
a chance to fulfill a dream. 
</P>
<P>
	The athletes carried the torch to the 1967 Pan American Games in  
Winnipeg in a 500-mile trek that traditionally precedes 
Olympic-type competitions -- but were not even allowed to attend the 
opening. 
</P>
<P>
	This time though, they were to take part as honored guests in  
the ceremony, though their exact role was a guarded secret. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe we are a unifying force to the games,'' said David  
Courchene Jr., one of the runners. ``We are carrying the spirit of 
our people. ... We are bringing a message of peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The torch-lighting and the role of the 1967 torch bearers was a  
centerpiece of the extravaganza that officially opened the games. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3,400-person event was promoted as a mix of music, dance and  
local traditions and featured the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra, the 
Royal Winnipeg Ballet, a 250-piece pipe and drum band and 500 
performers from 28 cultural groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside Winnipeg Stadium, hundreds of members of Canadian  
aboriginal groups protested what their leaders described as 
systematic human rights violations by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a protest against the Pan Am Games or the athletes,''  
said Terry Nelson, a native activist. ``We don't want them to leave 
with the impression that every thing is great here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson accused local officials of attempting to hide the  
province's racial tensions in an effort to portray the Games 
positively. But he praised the efforts of the organizing committee 
to honor Courchene and the other athletes left standing outside the 
stadium gates in 1967.

<HEADLINE> Brothers Cheat in S. Africa Marathon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- Two brothers passing  
themselves off as the same man were caught cheating in a 
long-distance race after a newspaper published photos showing them 
wearing watches on opposite wrists. 
</P>
<P>
	The photographs showed Sergio Motsoeneng and his brother running  
in the 54-mile Comrades Marathon. Both wore the same number and the 
same hat and shorts. 
</P>
<P>
	But the photos, printed in Beld newspaper, showed their  
wristwatches were on different arms, and one brother had a scar on 
his shin. 
</P>
<P>
	Motsoeneng said through a lawyer on Wednesday that his actions  
in last month's race were those of a desperate man from a poor 
family, the South African Press Association reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Motsoeneng -- a past Comrades gold medalist -- took ninth place  
and a $960 prize. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a very tragic situation,'' lawyer Clem Harrington was  
quoted by SAPA as saying. ``He has asked South Africa to forgive 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sergio Motsoeneng ran the first 45 minutes to a mobile toilet,  
where he exchanged vests and shoes with his younger brother, Fika. 
They made a second swap later in the race, and Sergio finished the 
race, Harrington explained. 
</P>
<P>
	The race was run downhill from Pietermaritzburg to Durban this  
year. In alternate years the race is run in the reverse direction. 
</P>
<P>
	It was first run in 1921 and draws more than 10,000 runners  
every year. First prize is $200,000.

	Ushakov denounced the attack July 13 in Moscow on Leopold

Choral Synagogue, and said prosecution of the admitted assailant 
was under special supervision. 
</P>
<P>
	Nikita Krivchun, 20, testified he had stabbed Kaimovsky to  
protest Judaism. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never met this man before,'' Krivchun told a Russian  
television station. ``I never knew him personally. I have nothing 
against him. It was not an act of revenge against him. It was a 
political act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ushakov, in a letter obtained from the Russian Embassy, said  
Krivchun was being prosecuted under a law that makes it a crime to 
attempt murder on the grounds of ethnic, racial and religious 
hatred and enmity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Russia has made an unequivocal choice in favor of democracy  
and pluralistic society in which there should be no place for 
nationalism, anti-Semitism, any form of xenophobia,'' Ushakov 
wrote.

<HEADLINE> A Tale of Two Plane Searches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PUYALLUP, Wash. (AP) -- There were no reporters camped outside  
the command post, no calls of concern from the president. 
</P>
<P>
	But for relatives of two men whose small plane vanished last  
weekend in the Cascade Range, it barely mattered that the world 
wasn't watching with the same intensity that attended the search 
for John F. Kennedy Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	They were caught in their own private anguish, clinging to hopes  
that grow more elusive each day. 
</P>
<P>
	``You wake up in the morning, half asleep, and you try to think  
about where they would have gone,'' Leo Walsh Jr. said Thursday 
morning as he waited for clouds to lift so the search for his 
father could resume. ``I've stared a hole through every map of 
western Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like the search for Kennedy, his wife and sister-in-law, the  
search for pilot Dennis Waldock, 57, and passenger Leo Walsh, 74, 
ended in tragedy. The men were found dead Friday night, along with 
the wreckage of their Cessna 337. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair disappeared Saturday as they flew toward a cloudy  
mountain pass 50 miles east of Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Every year, hundreds of small planes crash in the United States.  
Last year alone, 598 people died in general aviation accidents, 
according to federal aviation officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Few crashes attract as much public concern or government  
resources as the search for JFK Jr.'s plane, which plunged into the 
ocean off Martha's Vineyard last Friday night. That effort, covered 
live for days by TV networks, involved hundreds of searchers and 
dozens of aircraft, boats, Navy divers and underwater cameras -- 
even after it became obvious the mission had changed from rescuing 
survivors to recovering wreckage and bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	The search for Waldock and Walsh, meanwhile, proceeded more  
typically. No one here questioned the dedication of the mostly 
volunteer search-and-rescue teams. But there was also tacit 
recognition that not every resource would be available, nor would 
the search go on indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	F.E. ``Mac'' MacSpadden, coordinator of the air search for  
Waldock and Walsh, insisted that celebrity or lack thereof is not a 
factor in how a search is conducted. 
</P>
<P>
	Each day, about 20 airplanes piloted by volunteers have taken to  
the air, covering more than 4,340 square miles by Thursday night. 
Any more search planes would just get in the way, MacSpadden said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd do the same for Kennedy as I'd do for this guy,'' he said.  
``As long as I've got some hope here, we'll continue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy fog grounded search aircraft Friday morning. Shortly after  
5 p.m., a helicopter sighted the plane, just north of Interstate 90 
near the Granite Mountain trail, sheriff's spokesman John Urquhart 
said. A ground crew reached the scene a short time later and 
confirmed both men were dead, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The search made front-page news in Anchorage, Alaska, where both  
men are prominent in the business community, Waldock as a 
stockbroker, Walsh as a retired construction contractor and 
developer. Here in western Washington, however, newspapers paid far 
more attention to the East Coast search for Kennedy, relegating the 
search in their own backyard to brief stories on inside pages. 
</P>
<P>
	The men vanished Saturday as they flew west across the Cascade  
Range in an aircraft that Waldock had just bought in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Around noon, as the plane approached the Cascade Range, Waldock  
canceled his instrument-flight plan. In a decision that still 
puzzles search officials, Waldock chose to fly by visual cues, 
plunging into dense clouds filling Snoqualmie Pass. Witnesses 
reported seeing the Cessna 337 roaring through the foggy pass, 
hugging the highway. 
</P>
<P>
	By Saturday evening, Waldock's mother, waiting for him in the  
southwestern Washington town of Chehalis, reported him overdue. 
Search planes took to the air the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
	While Walsh's family gathered in Anchorage and Waldock's family  
kept a vigil in Chehalis, two of Walsh's sons joined the search. 
Leo, a Catholic priest in Eagle River, Alaska, and Steve, a 
construction contractor in Anchorage, went up each day in planes as 
observers. 
</P>
<P>
	Before they learned of the deaths, the brothers -- both pilots --  
had only praise for the searchers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything we've asked them to do, it turns out they've already  
done it,'' Leo said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Media Frustrated by Kennedy Story </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- For the hundreds of journalists who dropped  
everything and flocked to Massachusetts as the Kennedy story 
unfolded, the tale was irresistibly tragic and undeniably gripping. 
And the frustrations were numerous. 
</P>
<P>
	News first broke Saturday morning that a plane piloted by John  
F. Kennedy Jr. and carrying his wife and sister-in-law was missing. 
As the search continued, the coverage grew -- and so did media 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, the cameras that tailed John Jr. his entire life  
were kept away from his final rites Thursday, leaving networks with 
little more to show than a Navy destroyer sitting offshore. 
</P>
<P>
	News media boats were kept more than a mile away from the USS  
Briscoe, from which the ashes of Kennedy, his wife Carolyn Bessette 
Kennedy and her sister Lauren Bessette were dropped into the sea. 
</P>
<P>
	The event took hours, and from time to time, off-camera  
correspondents confessed to not knowing what was going on. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we watch from a distance, we really don't know much about  
the details and in some way, that's quite appropriate, because 
that's the way the Kennedy family would like it,'' MSNBC anchorman 
John Seigenthaler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Covering the Kennedy story was complicated from the start.  
</P>
<P>
	Ever-increasing restricted zones and a search that took place  
almost entirely underwater left many networks scrambling to find 
something to show. 
</P>
<P>
	The search led to lengthy shots of boats and aircraft while the  
families remained secluded as the hours and days passed. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the on-site coverage found correspondents and cameras  
clustered outside the Kennedy estate in Hyannis Port, a fact which 
CBS's Anthony Mason felt obliged to acknowledge last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the noise you hear in the background,'' he explained to  
viewers, ``is the hordes of journalists who are flocked there at 
the edge of the Kennedy compound.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, at Otis Air Force Base, where the National  
Transportation Safety Board set up a command post, more than 100 
reporters were kept in a World War II-era gymnasium with six phone 
lines. Some feared leaving to get a sandwich, lest they miss a bit 
of new information. 
</P>
<P>
	Others reporters complained of problems with cell phones and  
beepers due to the poor remote connections on the Cape Cod and 
Vineyard. There were other hassles of covering the news: One 
freelance photographer resorted to washing his shirt in the sink 
and drying it in the oven of his rented cottage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I smell because I don't have any clothing or underwear,'' said  
Adam Miller, a New York Post reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters and photographers also encountered restricted access  
to public property, where debris and personal belongings were 
washing up on shore. 
</P>
<P>
	``They kept us back like lepers when all we were trying to do  
was memorialize (the victims) in a respectful way,'' lamented New 
York Post reporter Mark Stamey. 
</P>
<P>
	Several reporters, however, said their inconveniences were  
nothing in comparison to the losses of the Kennedy and Bessette 
families. Said one reporter from a New England daily, who wouldn't 
give her name: ``It sounds really inappropriate to whine about our 
lives when there's been such a tragedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regular folks -- residents and Kennedy admirers alike -- quickly  
got fed up with the media frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The media is trying to get a picture of a dead body!''  
vacationer Judy Riley screamed as she walked past a phalanx of news 
trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Hewitt, the veteran executive producer of CBS's ``60  
Minutes,'' apologized to Caroline Kennedy, John Jr.'s sister, for 
the behavior of his colleagues. He delivered a letter Thursday, 
walking past reporters who have been camped outside her 
Bridgehampton, N.Y., home for four days. 
</P>
<P>
	``Watching people grieve is obscene,'' Hewitt, who has a home in  
the same Long Island resort town, told reporters. ``I wish the 
press were as classy as they (the Kennedys) are. 
</P>
<P>
	``Privacy is a higher right than that of the public's right to  
know,'' he said. ``No one who has respect for another human being 
should be doing this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both ``60 Minutes'' and its spin-off, ``60 Minutes II,'' aired  
pieces on the Kennedy tragedy this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Tedesco, a spokesman for the show, said Hewitt's comments  
did not concern coverage in general but specifically the media's 
``incursion on the grief'' of the Kennedys.

<HEADLINE> AOL: Volunteers Must Be 18 or Older </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DULLES, Va. (AP) -- America Online has decided that its nearly  
14,000 volunteers who lead chat rooms, report violations of 
Internet rules and answer the questions of puzzled users must be 
old enough to vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hosting chat rooms and monitoring message boards, being a  
community leader requires certain life experience, certain 
maturity,'' AOL spokesman Rich Damato said Friday. He said the age 
requirement will affect several hundred volunteers who have yet to 
turn 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Damato said the change was unrelated to a recent U.S. Department  
of Labor investigation and a lawsuit by seven former volunteers, 
who claim the volunteers should be paid for their work under 
federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dulles-based Internet company has more than 17 million  
members, excluding its CompuServe brand, and employs 12,000 
workers, not including volunteers.

<HEADLINE> Strawberry Focusing on Workouts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Darryl Strawberry approached it like just  
another day. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite no news from commissioner Bud Selig on whether the  
outfielder's 120-day suspension would be shortened, Strawberry 
began his third week of workouts Friday at the New York Yankees' 
minor league complex. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been basically, taking care of myself. I think that  
really is the most important part of my life right now,'' 
Strawberry said. ``I feel very positive down here. I've surrounded 
myself with good people and (it's) allowed myself to really do the 
things I need to do in my program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The chaotic situation involving baseball umpires has occupied  
Selig's time. While Strawberry's 120-day suspension is scheduled to 
run through Aug. 11, Selig said he would review it on July 22. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm told he is reviewing the situation, reviewing the doctor's  
reports,'' union lawyer Gene Orza said. ``His obligation is to move 
promptly, and I've been assured he will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry was suspended following his arrest in April on drug  
possession and solicitation charges. He later pleaded no contest in 
Hillsborough (Fla.) County Court. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the time comes that Mr. Selig makes his decision, I'll be  
ready to go,'' Strawberry said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Yankees have said little about Strawberry's status,  
he'll probably go to a minor league team once the suspension is 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel healthy and things are going in a positive way,''  
Strawberry said. ``I feel real good. I feel like I've gotten myself 
in good shape. Now, I've got to get in the great shape I need to 
be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry started running bases and participating in extensive  
left-field drills this week, and the Yankees are pleased by the 
improvement in ailing left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to take it day by day,'' Strawberry said. ``I'm not  
going to put any kind of pressure on myself. I know how to play the 
game. I'm really focused right now. We'll see what happens.''

<HEADLINE> Sen. Kennedy Delivers JFK Jr. Eulogy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In a heartbreakingly familiar scene, John F.  
Kennedy Jr. was eulogized Friday as a free spirit who carried the 
torch of America's first family of politics with unusual ease and 
grace and -- like his father -- ``had every gift but length of 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a boy who grew into a man with a zest for life and a  
love of adventure,'' said Sen. Edward Kennedy, JFK Jr.'s uncle. 
``He was a pied piper who brought us all along. ... He had a 
legacy, and he learned to treasure it. He was part of a legend, and 
he learned to live with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy's life was cut in half, the senator told 350 family  
members and friends who filled the velvet-lined pews at the 
Gothic-style Church of St. Thomas More on Manhattan's Upper East 
Side, where JFK Jr.'s mother often sought solace. 
</P>
<P>
	``We dared to think ... that this John Kennedy would live to  
comb gray hair,'' the senator said, borrowing from the poet William 
Butler Yeats. ``But like his father, he had every gift but length 
of years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The memorial Mass came a week after the young Kennedy's plane  
crashed off Martha's Vineyard -- killing him, his wife, Carolyn 
Bessette Kennedy, and sister-in-law Lauren Bessette. 
</P>
<P>
	Family and friends -- among them President Clinton, Hillary  
Rodham Clinton and Muhammad Ali -- celebrated Kennedy as a playful 
and courageous man who kept his bearings long after he was the 
child who saluted his father's casket and was cast as the heir to 
Camelot. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Kennedy, who delivered eulogies for Robert F. Kennedy in  
1968 and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis in 1994, invoked a phrase often 
used to describe the length of President Kennedy's term as he 
remarked on JFK Jr.'s marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a thousand days, he was a husband who adored the wife who  
became his perfect soul mate,'' Sen. Kennedy said. ``John's father 
taught us all to reach for the moon and the stars. John did that in 
all he did -- and he found his shining star when he married Carolyn 
Bessette.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The senator added: ``He was still becoming the person he would  
be, and doing it by the beat of his own drummer. He had only just 
begun. There was in him a great promise of things to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the 10-minute eulogy, JFK Jr.'s sister, Caroline  
Kennedy, rose and hugged her uncle, who had fought back tears. 
Mourners said she read from Shakespeare's ``The Tempest'' and, 
helped by her husband and three children, lighted a candle. 
</P>
<P>
	A gospel choir sang ``Amazing Grace.'' Worshipers sang along and  
tapped their seats to ``Swing Low, Sweet Chariot.'' Hip-hop artist 
Wyclef Jean was the soloist for the reggae anthem ``Many Rivers to 
Cross.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also among those filling the 126-year-old church were RFK's  
widow, Ethel Kennedy; Robert F. Kennedy Jr.; Maria Shriver and 
husband Arnold Schwarzenegger; Carolyn Bessette Kennedy's parents; 
and Maurice Tempelsman, Mrs. Onassis' longtime companion. 
</P>
<P>
	After the memorial, the congregation walked two blocks uptown to  
the landmark Convent of the Sacred Heart for a reception. Several 
Kennedys walked hand-in-hand, their heads down and their eyes 
hidden by sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
	The media-shy Caroline Kennedy, her husband, Edwin Schlossberg,  
and their children took a limousine to the reception as church 
bells rang and helicopters buzzed overhead. At one point, she 
lowered a window and waved to the crowd that had swelled on the 
sidewalks around the church in the hours before invitation-only 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	Onlookers were kept more than a half-block from the entrance to  
St. Thomas amid tight security. 
</P>
<P>
	Dog-walkers, nannies pushing strollers and tourists jockeyed for  
the chance to bid farewell to the man who grew up in front of a 
nation's eyes to become a criminal prosecutor, quiet 
philanthropist, irreverent magazine entrepreneur and subway-riding 
New Yorker -- one of their own. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I grew up with the Kennedys,'' said Alane Repa,  
48, visiting from Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Genie Wong, 46, who lives five blocks from the church, said she  
often saw Kennedy riding his bike in nearby Central Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, I'm sorry I never stopped to say hello,'' she said.  
``I'll never get that chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The service came one day after the ashes of the three crash  
victims were cast into the sea off the coast of Martha's Vineyard, 
near the crash site. JFK Jr. was 38; his wife of nearly three years 
was 33. Ms. Bessette, who was 34, is to be honored with a private 
service Saturday at an Episcopal church in her family's hometown of 
Greenwich, Conn.

<HEADLINE> Fox TV Ad Staff Selling Features </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) -- A salesperson blamed by a Fox  
television affiliate for offering to produce ``positive'' news 
stories for $15,000 no longer works for the company, the station 
owner said. 
</P>
<P>
	The advertising sales staff at WDSI in Chattanooga had told  
businesses the stories would be broadcast on the station's news 
programs. The station scrapped the promotion this month after local 
businesses complained. 
</P>
<P>
	``This entire offer was against company policy and had never  
been approved by the station's news department,'' said David 
Janecek, vice president of news for Pegasus Broadcast Television, a 
Pennsylvania-based company that owns Fox-61. 
</P>
<P>
	He called the incident an ``extreme example of unacceptable  
sales aggressiveness, not an issue of journalistic integrity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The station began broadcasting news shows this year for the  
first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Janecek would not identify the salesperson Thursday. He said  
future advertising promotions will be cleared by the station 
executives.

<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- A naturalist at Yosemite National Park was  
found dead Thursday near the employee housing unit where she lived, 
and the FBI and the National Park Service were investigating the 
case as a homicide. 
</P>
<P>
	The 26-year-old woman, whose name was not immediately released,  
was last seen alive leaving her office at the Yosemite Institute 
about 5 p.m. Wednesday, park spokesman Kendell Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman had planned to make the a long drive from the park to  
Sausalito to visit a friend, who reported her missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Rangers found the body near living quarters she shared with a  
man and a woman at employee housing units outside a campground. Her 
roommates were away on business, Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The institute is a nonprofit group that runs education programs  
through a partnership with the park service. 
</P>
<P>
	The area where the naturalist was found is in an area relatively  
unknown to tourists on the west side of the park. It's just a few 
miles away from El Portal, the town where three Yosemite sightseers 
were last seen alive in February before they turned up dead about a 
month later. 
</P>
<P>
	No charges have been filed in the slayings of Carole Sund, whose  
Eureka family has made millions in real estate, her daughter Juli, 
and family friend Silvina Pelosso from Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
	An FBI task force and federal grand jury continue to investigate  
the case, and have said they are confident that most of those 
responsible are behind bars on unrelated charges.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong OKs Disney Zoning Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Hong Kong's government approved a zoning plan  
Friday that would allow a possible Disney park to be built on an 
outlying island. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong's Town Planning Board said Penny's Bay on northeastern  
Lantau island was suitable for a world-class tourism area that 
would include a theme park and other recreation and support 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The Walt Disney Co. has repeatedly withheld comment since the  
Hong Kong government revealed in March that the territory was 
negotiating to build a new park, which would be Disney's second in 
Asia after Tokyo Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong had hoped to finish its negotiations with Disney by  
the end of June, but it ended up announcing early this month that 
officials needed four more months to try to resolve economic 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong wants a Disney park to help push the recession-mired  
economy to recovery, but critics warn it shouldn't come with deep 
concessions that would hurt Hong Kong's long-term interests.

<HEADLINE> Titans Get New President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Saying his oil business demands his  
attention in Texas, Bud Adams gave up the Tennessee Titans 
presidency Friday and hired a former Minnesota Vikings vice 
president as his replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Diamond, the NFL's executive of the year in 1998, will be  
the first person other than Adams to be team president in the 
franchise's four decades. Diamond also will be chief operating 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams, who remains the team's owner, said it wasn't easy to step  
back from the team he started in 1959 as the Houston Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been lacking in my time given to the Titans since they  
moved down here because I do have several very important businesses 
down in Houston,'' Adams said. ``I still would like to be working 
with the Titans full-time, but it's not in the books.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His decision was made easier after Diamond resigned in May as  
the Vikings' senior vice president of football operations, 
following a disagreement with owner Red McCombs over running the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Diamond, whose strength is running a team's business operations,  
will oversee all the Titans operations in Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent 24 years with the Vikings, starting on the public  
relations staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Diamond, hired as senior vice president last August, said he had  
talked with a couple other NFL teams, but was drawn to the Titans 
by all their changes. 
</P>
<P>
	The team, which moved from Houston two years ago, moves into a  
new practice facility next month and debuts a 67,500-seat stadium 
in an exhibition Aug. 27 with Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel like we're walking into a great situation,'' Diamond  
said of a team that has been 8-8 each of the last three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``The team is not too far away'' from the playoffs.  
</P>
<P>
	His biggest challenge will be cementing the Titans' identity in  
Tennessee and in the NFL now that the last vestige of the Oilers 
has been erased. 
</P>
<P>
	The team has had trouble attracting fans the last two seasons  
while awaiting a new stadium.

<HEADLINE> Plant Closed After Listeria Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILLIAMSTON, N.C. (AP) -- State and federal inspectors shut down  
a meat packing plant here after tests detected the potentially 
deadly listeria bacteria in its luncheon meats for the second time 
in three months. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, more than 16,000 pounds of ready-to-eat meat products  
from White Packing Co. such as bologna, salami and chopped ham were 
recalled because of the bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	In this case, the meat that tested positive was held at the  
plant and destroyed, so a recall was unnecessary, officials said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But White Packing's Williamston operations were suspended July  
16 because state inspectors had documented several problems, 
including the plant's failure to meet federal sanitation 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	State and federal agriculture officials remained at the plant  
Friday, working with plant representatives to identify problems and 
find ways to correct them. The plant must submit an ``action plan'' 
before it will be allowed to reopen.

<HEADLINE> Merck Profits Rise 12 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *BY PHIL GALEWITZ   	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Merck's second-quarter earnings rose 12 percent,  
driven mostly by strong U.S. sales of its cholesterol-lowering pill 
Zocor and its pharmacy benefit management business. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck made a $1.48 billion profit in the second quarter, or 61  
cents per share, compared to $1.32 billion or 54 cents per share in 
the same period a year ago. Results matched Wall Street's 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales in the quarter rose 24 percent to $8.02 billion from $6.47  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Zocor, Merck's top-selling drug, posted a 12 percent increase in  
sales to $1.09 billion in the second quarter, including a 20 
percent jump in the United States. Part of the reason for higher 
sales is that U.S. doctors are increasingly prescribing higher 
doses of Zocor. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the increase in U.S. sales, Zocor has steadily lost  
market share to Warner-Lambert and Pfizer's Lipitor, which is 
marketed as a more potent cholesterol drug. Zocor still has bigger 
worldwide sales largely because Lipitor has yet to enter the 
Japanese market. 
</P>
<P>
	Other drugs that helped Merck's earnings were the blood pressure  
medication Cozaar/Hyzaar, up 37 percent to $335 million, another 
blood pressure pill Prinivil, up 26 percent to $215 million and 
osteoporosis pill Fosamax, up 48 percent to $245 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck-Medco, which manages pharmacy benefits for large employers  
and health insurers, had $3.76 billion in revenues in the quarter, 
up 33 percent from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck's total sales received a boost because of an accounting  
change in how the company records revenues from a joint marketing 
program with the former drug manufacturer Astra. 
</P>
<P>
	Vioxx, Merck's new arthritis and pain drug which was launched in  
the United States in May, had $97 million in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	One continuing disappointment for Merck is its baldness drug  
Propecia, what had flat sales of $45 million in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months, Merck made $2.78 billion profit, or  
$1.15 per share, compared to $2.48 billion or $1.01 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales in the first six months rose 24 percent to $15.55 billion  
from $12.53 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Merck fell 37 1/2 cents Friday to close at $69 on the New  
York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Opposed to $792B Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- President Clinton hardened his objections to  
the Republicans' $792 billion tax-cutting plan Friday, saying 
America cannot ``afford a tax cut that big'' and still meet the 
needs of Social Security, Medicare and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Meeting with wealthy political contributors, Clinton said,  
``You'd be a lot better off'' in the short term with the GOP plan. 
But he said the Republican program passed Thursday by the House 
would rob money needed for Social Security, Medicare, education, 
crime fighting and other priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke at the beginning of a fund-raising weekend  
suddenly scrambled by plans to attends the funeral of King Hassan 
II of Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
	The president was flying from Cincinnati late Friday to Aspen to  
meet with big-money donors on Saturday. But he compressed his 
schedule to return to Washington Saturday evening and fly to 
Morocco for Sunday's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally, Clinton was to have spent a leisurely weekend in  
Aspen, returning Sunday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke in Cincinnati after attending the memorial service  
in New York for the late John F. Kennedy Jr., killed in a plane 
crash a week ago. The president recalled the last sentence of the 
eulogy by Sen. Edward Kennedy: ``Like his father, he had every gift 
but length of life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton added, ``All of us, including me, ought to do more every  
day to remember that life is fleeting and fragile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turning to the Republican tax plan, Clinton said the GOP agreed  
with him on the need to use the Social Security portion of the 
surplus to pay down the nation's debt. But he said their message 
was that the rest of the surplus should all go to a tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	To Democrats, he said, ``That's a mistake. Because if you look  
at the real long-term challenges of America, you can't honestly say 
we can afford a tax cut that big.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Aspen gathering brought together the Democratic Party's  
biggest donors, people who contributed at least $50,000. That 
bought the opportunity to schmooze with the president, Hillary 
Rodham Clinton and Cabinet secretaries. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic National Committee said it expected to raise $1  
million at the Aspen weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton came to Cincinnati one day after a fund-raising visit by  
Texas Gov. George W. Bush Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	The president spoke at the posh home of attorney-fund-raiser  
Stanley Chesley. Guests were asked to contribute $10,000 a couple, 
and the DNC said it expected to raise $350,000. But Chesley said he 
hoped guests might sweeten the pot to around $500,000.

<HEADLINE> EU To Require Car Recycling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The German government and major  
automakers vowed Friday to fight a European Union decision to make 
car manufacturers scrap and recycle automobiles at no extra cost to 
the owner. 
</P>
<P>
	European Union ambassadors adopted over Germany's objections a  
compromise Thursday that requires all cars in Europe, whether made 
there or not, to be recycled in the strictest such program in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	In a concession to German, British and Spanish industry, the  
recycling program will not be compulsory for all cars until 2006, 
instead of taking effect in 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturers must start reusing or recycling 80 percent of the  
weight of the materials in cars by 2006. 
</P>
<P>
	However, any cars put onto the market after Jan. 1, 2001 are  
immediately subject to the recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
	Car manufacturers claim the program will cost them $10 billion,  
an expense they say will have to be passed along to car buyers in 
some way. 
</P>
<P>
	The German government said in a statement Friday that it refused  
to back the compromise proposal because ``it still leads to grave 
disadvantages for the automotive industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The main German industry lobby VDA said the compromise ``still  
cuts to the bone for the German auto industry.'' It said it was 
weighing a possible legal challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	VDA said it has never opposed recycling cars, but objects to the  
timing of forcing automakers to take back all the cars sold before 
the law takes effect. 
</P>
<P>
	``It isn't legal to make new laws retroactive,'' BMW spokesman  
Juerg Dinner said. 
</P>
<P>
	ACEA, the European carmakers association, took the same  
position.

<HEADLINE> Three Charged in Immigration Scam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Three people defrauded immigrants in 25  
states out of more than $4 million by selling them residency papers 
they never received, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the scheme had 1,250 victims and was one of the  
nation's biggest immigration frauds. Desperate foreigners paid up 
to $10,000 for the residency papers, U.S. Attorney Paul Warner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were put off, stalled, delayed and occasionally given  
some money back to keep quiet,'' Warner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Manoel Feliciano Silva, 38, was arrested Thursday and was being  
held in Utah on state fraud, money laundering and racketeering 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	In Miami, a federal grand jury indicted Leonardo Ramon  
Caballero, 43, and his wife, Flor Caballero, 41, on conspiracy and 
fraud charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Silva, a Brazilian and permanent U.S. resident, opened an office  
in Orem, Utah, in 1997 and collected $1 million from 250 
immigrants, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of these people were here illegally'' and seeking green  
cards, said Jeff Robinson, an investigator for the Utah County 
Attorney's office. ``In fact, many of these people would not have 
qualified for a green card. They need a sponsor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants claimed to have connections inside the U.S.  
Immigration and Naturalization Service, so the FBI is investigating 
whether anyone at INS was involved.

<HEADLINE> Rival Bids for Mirror Group OK'd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Competition authorities cleared the way Friday for  
two British media companies to press ahead with their rival 
takeover bids for Mirror Group PLC, publisher of the tabloid Daily 
Mirror. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Trade and Industry approved the bids from  
Regional Independent Media Holdings PLC and Trinity PLC. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Trade and Industry Secretary Stephen Byers said that  
Trinity would have to sell its interests in four other newspapers 
as a condition for the approval, to help preserve diversity and 
competition among newspapers in Northern Ireland. Those papers are 
the Belfast Telegraph, Sunday Life, Community Telegraph and Farm 
Trader. 
</P>
<P>
	A former chief executive of Mirror Group said Tuesday that he is  
trying to arrange financial backing for a bid to buy the media 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	David Montgomery's discussions with financial institutions  
raises the prospect of a three-way takeover battle. Montgomery was 
forced out of his job earlier this year by Mirror shareholders 
unhappy with his performance.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Card Market Coming Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- After a strike wiped out the 1994 World Series,  
Cal Ripken's rookie card dropped to about $20. The same card for 
Greg Maddux, then winner of three straight Cy Young awards, sold 
for a paltry $5. 
</P>
<P>
	On the floor of the 20th National Sports Collectors' Convention  
this weekend, Ripken rookies were selling for $70, and Maddux's had 
climbed to $30. 
</P>
<P>
	The rapid price hikes are a sign that the same stars who helped  
bring fans back to the ballparks in the last two seasons have also 
revived the card industry -- bloated before the strike and then 
deflated as fans turned away from the national pastime. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa's rookie cards are going for $300  
each, mainly because of last season's historic home run chase. In 
1994, McGwire's card was worth about $10 and Sosa's just $2. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember the strike and not being able to go to games,''  
said 12-year-old Geoffrey Feen, who traveled to the show from 
Detroit with his parents. ``But I never stopped liking baseball, 
and the cards just came along with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While still trying to satisfy serious collectors, the $500  
million sports-card industry has partially rebounded by 
rededicating itself to its core market -- 8- to 12-year-old boys 
like Geoffrey. 
</P>
<P>
	Flashy graphics and holograms have replaced posed shots, and the  
ritual of collecting entire teams has disappeared with the rise of 
free agency. 
</P>
<P>
	In the old days kids would have to buy three to four packs just  
to get one superstar's card. Nowadays, collectors' packs usually 
contain several stars, but utility infielders with .220 averages 
are tough to find. 
</P>
<P>
	``That instant gratification is what keeps him buying cards,''  
said Joe Verno, a serious collector from Denver who introduced 
12-year-old son Wes to the hobby four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	To serve all kinds of collectors, card manufacturers started  
offering several price levels, with packs ranging from 99 cents to 
$4 or $5 for premium cards. 
</P>
<P>
	And Upper Deck, one of the industry leaders, entered the  
computer age in an effort to win over the Nintendo generation. The 
company has added to some packs mini CD-ROMs known as ``PowerDeck'' 
cards, which feature a computer disc with player stats, video clips 
and sound bites. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest competition both in interest and money to card  
makers is video games,'' said Dan Hitt, sports data publishing 
manager for Beckett Publications, which produces several different 
collectible guides. ``This isn't the old days when kids would play 
baseball all day and then stay up all night looking at their 
baseball cards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Industrywide streamlining has also helped clear up a muddled  
market. Before the 1994 strike, there were at least 10 different 
card brands. Buyouts and bankruptcies over the last few years have 
whittled that number down to four -- the once-dominant Topps, along 
with Fleer, Donruss and Upper Deck. 
</P>
<P>
	``That made it a little bit easier to pick my favorite  
companies,'' said Mike Delzoppo, an 11-year-old from Cleveland who 
began collecting soon after the strike ended. ``I don't worry about 
what a card is worth. I just try going after my favorite players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Card companies need only look at the recent drop-off in demand  
for NBA cards after last year's lockout to realize that kids are 
easily turned off by upheaval in the sports world. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the dads and the grandpas and the uncles that are keeping  
collecting going,'' said Geoffrey's mother, Liz. ``If they weren't 
there to pass it along, I think it would have ceased to exist, 
especially with what's gone on lately and the amount of diversions 
kids have nowadays. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, it will still be around when he's older so he can  
pass it on to his kids.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Gore in Environmental Quandry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORNISH, N.H. (AP) -- When Vice President Al Gore paddled a canoe  
along the Connecticut River for a photo opportunity, he had some 
help staying afloat. 
</P>
<P>
	Utility officials, saying they were acting on a request by the  
Connecticut River Joint Commission, opened a dam and released about 
4 billion gallons to raise the level of the river so Gore's canoe 
wouldn't get stuck in low water during a campaign visit Thursday. 
The request came after commission members and the Secret Service 
toured the site before Gore's visit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Times, which reported details of the water  
discharge Friday, quoted a state official who suggested that the 
presidential candidate received special treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``They won't release water for the fish when we ask them to, but  
somehow they find themselves able to release it for a politician,'' 
said John Kassel, director of the Vermont Department of Natural 
Resources, according to the Times. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kassel, who accompained Gore on the canoe trip, said Friday  
that the quotes were not accurate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it was absolutely appropriate to release those  
flows,'' Kassel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said no one on Gore's campaign staff  
asked for the water to be released. 
</P>
<P>
	``In fact, earlier in the week, we specifically requested that  
the water flow not be altered in any shape, way or form because of 
our visit. Our understanding is that the increased flow has had 
nothing but a positive impact on the environment,'' Lehane said. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy managing editor Fran Coombs said The Times stood by the  
story ``as written and reported.''

<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Supermarket powerhouse Safeway Inc. will purchase  
the 116-store Houston-based Randall's Food Markets chain in a $1.4 
billion cash and stock deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company will operate more than 1,645 stores in 19

Sales are estimated at $30 billion.

and 12 in Austin, plus 58 Tom Thumb stores in the Dallas-Fort Worth 
area, will continue to operate under the Randall's and Tom Thumb 
names. 
</P>
<P>
	``This transaction is a wonderful opportunity for Safeway to  
continue its growth strategy, and we are thrilled to be re-entering 
the fast-growing Texas market with such a high quality operation,'' 
Safeway chairman Steve Burd said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Randall's chairman R. Randall Onstead Jr., whose family owns 21  
percent of Randall's outstanding shares, also hailed the merger, 
citing the supermarket industry's trend toward consolidation. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a member of the Safeway team, we will have an even larger  
base of financial strength, buying power, best practices and 
successful private brands from which to grow,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Safeway will pay $855 million in cash and exchange about 10.9  
million shares of Safeway stock for Randall's shares. Safeway also 
will assume $375 million of Randall's debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Safeway expects to complete the purchase, which awaits the  
approval of a majority of Randall's outstanding shares, during the 
third quarter of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Safeway rose $2.75, or 5 percent, to $53.50 in trading  
on the New York Stock Exchange

<HEADLINE> 49ers Closing in on Phillips Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Lawrence Phillips is about to get  
another shot at the NFL and barring a last-minute hitch, it appears 
he'll be playing for the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Bill Walsh said Friday, after lengthy talks with  
Phillips' agent, Mitch Frankel, that the two sides neared a 
contract agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh said he planned to finalize the deal with Phillips by  
Monday, when the 49ers open training camp at the University of the 
Pacific in Stockton. He said he didn't foresee any stumbling blocks 
to signing Phillips unless another team jumps in and ups the ante. 
</P>
<P>
	Another source close to the team said Phillips' signing was so  
widely anticipated that the 49ers already were making arrangements 
for a news conference Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to be close at this point,'' Walsh said. ``We've  
been exchanging proposals and evaluating them for some time. We're 
close, but it's not complete. If we sign anything, it will be done 
on Monday, along with our draft choices. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are other clubs,'' Walsh added. ``And you never know.  
Like with Charles Haley, right at the 11th hour, the new owner of 
the Redskins flew him to Washington just like that and we were a 
little shaky there. And then he refused, and came back and joined 
us. But things like that can always happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips, released previously by the St. Louis Rams and Miami  
Dolphins because of spotty play and off-the-field problems, drew 
renewed interest from NFL teams after starring for Barcelona of NFL 
Europe. In what was a trouble-free campaign for Phillips this 
spring, he rushed for 1,021 yards and 14 touchdowns in 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers reportedly have offered Phillips a two-year,  
incentive-laden deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo and Green Bay were also competing with the 49ers for the  
services of Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a league source, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said the other suitors were fading from the picture and Phillips 
had zeroed in on San Francisco, which has a void at running back 
because of the loss of Garrison Hearst. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearst, who set a team record by rushing for 1,570 yards last  
season, has run into circulatory complications that have stagnated 
his recovery from a broken left ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors are scheduled to operate on Hearst's lower left leg  
Saturday to try to stimulate blood flow to the damaged area. 
Hearst, who was hurt on the first play of a playoff loss at Atlanta 
last January, is expected to miss most of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips would compete with Charlie Garner, signed last week as  
a free agent, along with Travis Jervey, to become the 49ers' top 
running back. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh, who once said he would never have drafted Phillips  
because of his history of violence, has conceded acquiring him 
would be a gamble. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh also acknowledged earlier this week that the 49ers have  
gotten some negative feedback from fans and ticketholders upset 
over the team's pursuit of Phillips, who assaulted a former 
girlfriend while playing at Nebraska and struck a woman who refused 
to dance with him at a Florida nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do have some concern and let's face it, there has to be  
concern on a lot of people's part,'' Walsh said, adding that 
Phillips would be cut at the first sign of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	But Walsh also believes surrounding Phillips with such veteran  
leaders as Steve Young and Jerry Rice will provide a positive 
influence and ease the expectations on him, giving him the best 
chance to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anybody can make this a success, our team can,'' Walsh  
said.

<HEADLINE> 'The Sopranos' Lead Emmy Pack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The lead character is a mob boss, the  
scene-stealer is his scheming mother and the whole show revolves 
around a New Jersey crime family's collective angst. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardly the kind of television show Emmy voters tend to shower  
with awards come September. But HBO's critically acclaimed series 
``The Sopranos'' still nabbed 16 Emmy nominations on Thursday, 
including best drama, the first cable show ever to be recognized in 
the dramatic series category. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope what it is is the character flaws, people identify with  
them,'' ``Sopranos'' creator and producer David Chase said from New 
York after the awards were announced in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Also out in front of the Emmy pack, with 13 bids apiece, were  
Fox's ``Ally McBeal,'' ABC's legal drama ``The Practice'' and the 
CBS miniseries ``Joan of Arc.'' HBO's racy ``Sex and the City'' 
became the second cable series to be nominated as best comedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Although ``The Sopranos'' was the front-runner in nominations,  
some speculate that its cynicism and tough cast of characters might 
turn some people off when it comes time to vote on actual awards. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lack of sympathetic characters and how courageous the show  
is in championing them can hurt its chances,'' said Thomas O'Neil, 
author of ``The Emmys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another HBO series, Garry Shandling's talk-show satire ``The  
Larry Sanders Show,'' also was showered with Emmy nominations 
during its run. But it failed to win the top prize, as best comedy 
series, and O'Neil believes its pervasive cynicism was a factor. 
</P>
<P>
	Other bids for ``The Sopranos'' went to series star James  
Gandolfini; Edie Falco, who plays his wife; Lorraine Bracco, the 
unwilling mob therapist; and to Nancy Marchand, the former ``Lou 
Grant'' star who plays Tony Soprano's treacherous mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the other competitors are colleagues as well: Camryn  
Manheim, Lara Flynn Boyle and Holland Taylor of ``The Practice'' 
are all named in the best supporting actress category. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Franz of ``NYPD Blue'' will be competing for a best actor  
trophy with his former co-star, Jimmy Smits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to say I wouldn't want to win it, because I  
would, but I will be just as happy if his name was announced,'' 
Franz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Emmy winners will be chosen by academy peer panels meeting in  
August. Fox will air the ceremony live on Sept. 12.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- The trip for U.S. athletes from a  
processing center in Grand Forks, N.D., to the Pan American Games 
in Winnipeg is at least organically correct. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because four buses provided by the University of North  
Dakota to shuttle athletes and visitors are running on a 
cleaner-burning fuel made partly from soybean oil. 
</P>
<P>
	The fuel, called B20, is a blend of 20 percent biodiesel and 80  
percent petroleum diesel. More than half of the biodiesel is made 
from soybean oil. 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Aulich, manager of the University of North Dakota's Energy &AMP;  
Research Center, said the biodiesel is a renewable fuel made from 
vegetable oil, animal fats and recycled restaurant grease. 
</P>
<P>
	``Biodiesel is biodegradable and nontoxic. It reduces the  
exhaust emissions of fine particles and contains no sulfur or 
aromatics,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The buses are carrying signs proclaiming the type of fuel they  
are using. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	STILL ON A SOCCER HIGH:@ Jay Hoffman, the head coach of the U.S.  
women's soccer team at the Pan Am Games, still is basking in the 
glory of the World Cup triumph. Hoffman was an assistant coach with 
the national team. 
</P>
<P>
	``The response by the American public and even the public all  
over the world was absolutely fantastic,'' Hoffman said. ``It has 
given the sport great exposure and women's sports unbelievable 
exposure, and I think our ladies carried it and made it what it 
was. 
</P>
<P>
	``Going through airports and getting standing ovations was  
amazing. It still has not stopped. I stopped back home in Cleveland 
for a couple days and went out for dinner and the number of people 
who said they watched the games was remarkable. It's people who I 
would never expect to sit down and watch soccer, but they did. 
</P>
<P>
	``I played golf with a buddy of mine, and people went out on  
their back porch and gave me applause and congratulations.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MAKING THE BEST OF IT:* The United States tied Canada 1-1 in an  
exhibition baseball game on Thursday night at Whittier Park. The 
field is located one mile from the Pan Am baseball site at CanWest 
Global Park, home of Northern League's Winnipeg Goldeyes. 
</P>
<P>
	The facilities were not exactly on the major league level.  
Players changed clothes in the dugout. There was one portable 
toilet, which was marked for athletes' use only. There was no 
scoreboard. It had the look of a spring training practice field. 
</P>
<P>
	A makeshift concession stand was put together to sell hot dogs  
and soft drinks. The American players brought in their own food -- 
from McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
	During the game, the local club that runs the field, St.  
Boniface-St. Vital Baseball Club, passed a hat around in the crowd 
of about 500 for a 50-50 drawing. They hope donations will help the 
locals continue to operate the park. Otherwise, they might have to 
turn over day-to-day operations to the city by next season. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *STRUGGLING SPRINTERS:* The United States, which has dominated  
track and field at the Pan Am Games with 83 gold medals and 187 
total medals, has not won the men's 100, 200, 400 and 400 or 1,600 
relay since 1987. That year, the winners were Lee McRae in the 100, 
Floyd Heard in the 200 and Raymond Pierre in the 400. The 400 relay 
featured Carl Lewis, Harvey Glance, Lee McNeill and McRae. The 
1,600 relay team included Kevin Robinzine, Roddie Haley, Mark Rowe 
and Pierre and set the Pan Ams record of 2:59.54. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CRAWLING AND CRYING:* U.S. wrestler Matt Lindblad is likely to  
face longtime nemesis Filiberto Ascuy of Cuba at some point in the 
Greco-Roman competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Ascuy is the defending Pan American Games champion and was an  
Olympic gold medalist in 1996. He beat Lindblad 7-3 earlier this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of a grudge thing,'' said Lindblad, who wrestles at  
167.5 pounds. ``Every time we wrestle, it's very close, very 
emotional.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No match was more emotional than their meeting at the 1996 World  
Cup in Colorado Springs, Colo., when Ascuy crawled off the mat in 
tears after losing to Lindblad. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would love to see him crawling off the mat crying again,''  
Lindblad said with a grin.

<HEADLINE> `Tarzan' Leaps Into Digital Format </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- The King of the Apes is swinging into the  
digital age. 
</P>
<P>
	Walt Disney's animated ``Tarzan,'' in cinemas on traditional  
film for the last month, is debuting in digital format today in 
Walt Disney World's movie complex in Florida and at two California 
theaters. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney executives, who bill ``Tarzan'' as the first all-digital  
release, said Thursday they wanted to give the format a trial-run 
in theaters and let viewers catch a glimpse of the new technology 
expected to revolutionize movie distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	The new format uses technology similar to digital video discs.  
The movie images are digitized, then sent to theaters on discs, 
beamed by satellite or transmitted over fiber-optic cable. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides greatly reducing distribution costs of bulky movie  
reels, digital cinema would give viewers an image that matches or 
exceeds that of film, said Disney executives and officials from 
Texas Instruments, which developed the digital projector being used 
for ``Tarzan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike film, digital movies also will not deteriorate through  
wear-and-tear, said Thomas Schumacher, president of Walt Disney 
Feature Animation. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to see the film right as we made it,'' Schumacher  
said. ``You're going to see it that way in screening No. 2, 
screening No. 20 and screening No. 2,000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few movies, most notably ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom  
Menace,'' had limited releases in digital versions that were 
transferred from film. Disney said ``Tarzan'' was different because 
no film was involved: The hand-drawn animation was digitally stored 
then used to create the digitized version. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney conducted a demonstration Thursday showing scenes from  
``Tarzan'' in film and digital formats side-by-side. The most 
noticeable difference was richer color in the digital version, 
though in some scenes the digital colors were so heavy they made 
the images harder to see. 
</P>
<P>
	Otha Johnson, a manager at the Burbank AMC theater where Disney  
held its demonstration, said that along with a sharper image, 
digital movies make projectionists' jobs easier because they do not 
have heavy film reels to rewind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like the way this is headed,'' Johnson said. ``Ever since I  
saw the digital `Star Wars,' I'm kind of spoiled. I want to see 
digital all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The current pricetag for digital projectors might keep some  
theaters from embracing the switch. Conventional film projectors 
typically cost about $30,000, while a digital system can run three 
times as much. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Barlow, executive vice president for Disney's  
motion-picture group, said a fair number of theaters might be 
equipped with digital projectors in two to four years, though both 
formats likely will be around for the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
	``Film will exist for many, many years,'' Barlow said.  
``There'll be dual inventory for many, many years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob England, manager of digital imaging for Texas Instruments,  
said he took his two nephews to see the regular film version of 
``Tarzan'' a few weeks ago. England received an e-mail from them 
this week saying they wanted to see it again, but in digital 
format, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on that statistical sample of two, digital cinema will  
be a tremendous success,'' England said.

<HEADLINE> Author of Feminist Novels Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Barbara Raskin, 63, author of feminist novels  
about women in middle age, most notably ``Hot Flashes,'' died 
Friday at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore of complications 
following surgery for vascular disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Published two decades after the women's movement kicked into  
gear, ``Hot Flashes'' of 1987 was considered an important work for 
its celebration of female friendship. The book chronicles three 
women who gather to mourn the death of a writer friend, who had 
left behind a journal describing her despair when her husband left 
for a younger woman. The friends then salvage the writer's 
unfinished autobiographical novel, written for revenge. 
</P>
<P>
	The book was on The New York Times bestsellers list for four  
months and was praised for capturing the feelings of a generation 
of well-educated women who raised families while their husbands 
pursued careers. 
</P>
<P>
	Raskin's other books include ``The National Anthem,'' a look at  
Washington during the Watergate investigation, ``Loose Ends'' and 
``Out of Order.'' She received a fiction award from the National 
Endowment for the Arts in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Raskin and her then-husband, Marcus, also were known for their  
political activism, after Marcus Raskin left his job at the White 
House and came out against the Vietnam War in the 1960s. Their home 
became a meeting place for the civil rights and antiwar movement. 
The couple later divorced.

<HEADLINE> LT Promises No Tears at Induction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Don't expect to see tears streaming  
down Lawrence Taylor's face when he is inducted into the Pro 
Football Hall of Fame next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``You got a better chance of hitting the lottery than seeing me  
cry,'' the former New York Giants linebacker said Thursday. ``I'll 
tell you now, if I cry you can come up and spank me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, 40, will be inducted at a ceremony in Canton, Ohio on  
Aug. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor's off-the-field problems, which included two drug-related  
arrests after his retirement in 1993, were his biggest obstacle to 
being voted into the Hall of Fame in January. Several didn't vote 
for the man considered the prototype for the modern linebacker 
because of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor admits he still has to struggle to stay clean.  
</P>
<P>
	``The demons come up every day,'' he said. ``You do the best you  
can with it. I have it under control today and, hopefully, I'll 
have it under control tomorrow.''

<HEADLINE> Woodstock '99 Draws Thousands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME, N.Y. (AP) -- More than 200,000 music fans streamed into  
town Friday for Woodstock '99, a three-day celebration of love and 
peace held at a former military base instead of the farm where the 
original antiwar festival took place 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	James Brown opened the show, introduced as the ``general of  
soul'' as he looked out on giant hangars that used to house B-52 
bombers. Also on the weekend bill were Limp Bizkit, Dave Matthews 
Band, Korn, Jewel and Sheryl Crow. 
</P>
<P>
	While original Woodstock announcer Wavy Gravy returned to urge  
fans to take care of each other, he was surrounded by reminders 
that it was a long way from 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	Skateboarders sailed up ramps in an ``extreme sports'' park,  
vendors sold hemp tacos and people complained that cell phone 
transmission lines were jammed. 
</P>
<P>
	By midday, the crowd was estimated at 220,000. Promoters planned  
for 250,000 but said they would keep selling tickets as long as 
people wanted to get in. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's 1999, the turn of the century, and this is going to be  
the biggest party of the century,'' said Shawn Hagen, who drove 27 
hours with four friends from Monticello, Minn., to attend the 
concert. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities reported few problems, but first aid workers were  
kept busy treating several hundred people woozy from the 90-degree 
heat. One woman was in labor in a first aid tent. Concert promoters 
scrambled to find space with a 245-acre campground overflowing even 
before the music started. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown belted out ``Cold Sweat,'' but that was wishful thinking  
for his audience. Fans poured bottled water over each others' heads 
and crowded a ``rain tent,'' where they were drenched with a fine 
mist, if they could get in. 
</P>
<P>
	``We walked by it,'' said Heather Garland, 25, of Bloomfield,  
N.J. ``There were too many sweaty bodies in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Few fans were complaining, though. Candace Redden, 28, drove  
nearly two days from Canada with two friends, leaving their van in 
Maine when it broke down and renting a car. 
</P>
<P>
	``We come from Nova Scotia and not a lot of bands get up  
there,'' Ms. Redden said. ``This is an opportunity to see it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police reported three arrests, two for minor offenses and one  
for speeding and driving while intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
	One fan was sent on his way when he entered a state police  
cruiser, thinking it was a taxi, and asked to be taken to a stage. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was just confused,'' said New York State police Maj. James  
Parmley.

<HEADLINE> Intense Heat Boosts Grain, Soybeans / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures soared Friday on the  
Chicago Board of Trade as traders anticipated the Midwest's 
prolonged heat wave would hurt crops. 
</P>
<P>
	December corn futures prices climbed to a three-week high as  
temperatures remained in the 90s across the Midwest. November 
soybeans prices jumped more than 25 cents a bushel to their highest 
level in more than a month. 
</P>
<P>
	The scorching temperatures, expected to continue into next week,  
could cut yields. Although some rain was forecast across the Corn 
Belt over the next few days, it was not expected to be enough to 
make up for moisture lost from the soil during the extreme heat. 
Little or no rain was expected in other key growing areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat prices saw a boost in sympathy with the increases in corn  
and soybeans. Talk of possible exports to Iran also bolstered 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 8 3/4 cents to $2.78 3/4 a bushel;  
December corn rose 9 1/4 cents to $2.24 1/2 a bushel; December oats rose 
4 1/4 cents to $1.21 a bushel; November soybeans rose 25 1/4 cents to 
$4.81 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork futures rose on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while beef  
futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle rose .43 cent to 65.65 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle fell .60 cent to 76.75 cents a pound; August lean 
hogs rose 2 cents to 48.87 cents a pound; August pork bellies rose 
2.77 cents to 43.37 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Harrison Guitar To Be Auctioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Beatle George Harrison strummed the guitar on a  
London rooftop during the band's final performance 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the custom-made rosewood Fender Telecaster is expected to  
fetch more than 200,000 pounds ($320,000) when auctioned by Bonhams 
on August 19. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is incredibly important. It is the one Beatles guitar to  
have come up for such a long time,'' said Bonhams spokeswoman Sarah 
Allen. 
</P>
<P>
	The guitar was commissioned by classic rock guitar maker Leo  
Fender as a gift to Harrison in 1968. The former Beatle used it 
extensively at both the Twinkenham and Apple studios in recording 
the Beatles' ``Let it Be'' album and film. 
</P>
<P>
	The instrument was also in Harrison's hands for the band's final  
performance on the rooftop of Apple headquarters in London's Savile 
Row on January 30, 1969. Harrison used it to play the famous tune 
``Get Back.''

<HEADLINE> Gum Maker Issues Allergy Alert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MORRIS PLAINS, N.J. (AP) -- Warner-Lambert Co. said Friday it was  
taking two new Trident chewing gum products off the market so they 
can be re-labeled to better warn people with milk allergies not to 
use them. 
</P>
<P>
	The products, Trident for Kids and Trident Advantage, contain  
Recaldent, a milk-casein derivative. At least two children have 
experienced an allergic reaction, but both recovered, the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The products, launched last month, can be identified by an  
oval-shaped Recaldent logo on the front of the package. The company 
says it plans to make the logo more prominent on the new labels.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Mixed; Dow Down 58.26 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks extended their losses Friday as  
the renewed threat of higher interest rates convinced investors 
that the strong corporate earnings of the second quarter might be 
in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	After dropping as much as 100 points in early trading, the Dow  
Jones industrial average closed down 58.26 at 10,910.96. For the 
week, the Dow lost 298.88 points, or 2.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed, as the Nasdaq composite  
index, which fell steeply earlier this week, managed a last-minute 
gain of 7.96 to close at 2,692.40. For the week, the Nasdaq lost 
6.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks and brokerages led the Dow lower Friday, as Thursday's  
remarks from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan echoed on Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan told Congress that while 1999 has been an exceptional  
year for the U.S. economy, the central bank would ``act promptly 
and forcefully'' to raise interest rates at the first hint of 
inflation pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday, financial services stocks were hit hardest. J.P. Morgan,  
down 2 3/4 at 133 9/16, was the weakest component of the Dow. Big 
rival brokerages like Merrill Lynch, down 2 5/16 at 71 11/16, also 
tumbled. Those businesses are generally the first to suffer from 
rate increases, because clients postpone borrowing in light of the 
higher costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat of higher rates also sent bond prices plummeting for  
a second straight session, pushing the yield on the 30-year 
Treasury bond up to 6.02 percent from 5.96 percent late Thursday. 
Traders consider bond yields above 6 percent a menace to stocks, 
because at that level, bonds present an attractive investment 
alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	Debate over Greenspan's message deflected some attention from  
the latest companies to report strong earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``After Greenspan's speech, many believe that the Fed may be  
more aggressive than expected,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior vice 
president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. ``The fear of higher interest rates 
is overshadowing the strong earnings we are seeing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the positive earnings news Friday was a report from Sun  
Microsystems, which said its fourth-quarter profit grew a 
better-than-expected 30 percent. Sun's stock rose 3 3/16 to 70 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer seller Gateway rose 10 1/8 to 73 after the company  
reported a 47 percent increase in second-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Most other high-technology leaders were lower, also stumbling  
under the weight of Greenspan's comments. Their often-high 
valuations become less appealing to investors if high interest 
rates are cutting into profits. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online and Microsoft both fell, despite the fact that  
both posted strong earnings this week. AOL fell 2 9/16 to 107 
15/16, and Microsoft slipped 13/16 to 90 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a definite tug-of-war between the Fed and rosy  
earnings,'' said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo &AMP; 
Co. The earnings calendar remains full next week, with Dow 
component American Express scheduled to report on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by nearly a 2-to-1 margin  
on the New York Stock Exchange. Composite volume totaled a calm 
761.88 million shares, compared with 934.93 million in the previous 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 4.03 to 1,356.94. The NYSE  
composite index fell 2.91 to 638.87, and the American Stock 
Exchange composite index fell 3.52 to 796.29. The Russell 2000 
index of smaller companies lost 3.11 to 448.38. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas indexes were mostly lower. Japan's Nikkei stock average  
fell 1.11 percent. In Europe, Germany's DAX index lost 0.6 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 1.4 percent, and France's CAC-40 dropped 
1.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Broncos Begin Post-Elway Era </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREELEY, Colo. (AP) -- Are the Denver Broncos reluctant to face a  
future without John Elway? No way. 
</P>
<P>
	Tight end Shannon Sharpe, one of the retired quarterback's  
favorite targets, was so anxious to get to camp at Northern 
Colorado University that he got a speeding ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	It's easy to get pumped up for football when you've won the last  
two Super Bowls, and no one is conceding there won't be a third 
straight just because Bubby Brister, and not Elway, will be the guy 
throwing the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``We definitely have to go on,'' Sharpe said. ``I'm not going to  
sit here and try to kid anybody and say that we don't wish that he 
(Elway) was back, because we do. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bubby now has to prove that he can throw the football, that he  
can beat people. If Bubby can't throw the football, we're in 
trouble. He knows that. We know that. There's no sense in me trying 
to sugarcoat it, but I think Bubby can get the job done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did last season, guiding the Broncos to five victories when  
Elway was sidelined by injuries. Nobody expects Brister to put up 
Hall of Fame statistics, but there will be no shortage of pressure. 
A crowd of cameras and reporters greeted him as he arrived Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I can deal with it for a year or two and then let  
somebody else take over,'' Brister, 36, said. ``I'm excited about 
it. I'm ready to do some talking with my body instead of my 
mouth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So are his teammates, who throughout the day pulled to the curb  
outside the dorm in luxury sedans and shiny sport-utility trucks to 
unload quilts, pillows and video disc players. 
</P>
<P>
	While his former teammates prepared for training camp, Elway was  
vacationing with his family, far removed from the spotlight he held 
since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	There was an Elway at camp, however.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I'm filling any void, but it's different,'' said  
John Elway's father, Jack Elway, the team's director of pro 
scouting. ``His time had to come eventually. It's here, and I'm 
sure he doesn't have any reservations that he had to change gears 
and go in another direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The quarterback's absence drew as much attention as his presence  
ever did. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be different for everybody,'' coach Mike  
Shanahan said, ``but his spirit is still here. How competitive John 
was and what he's meant to this organization, it's still in every 
player on this football team. Even though he's gone, his spirit's 
still within us.''

<HEADLINE> Stroller Couple Can Sue NYC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A Danish woman and a New York City man arrested  
for leaving their infant in a stroller outside a restaurant while 
they had a drink inside may proceed with a lawsuit against the 
city, a judge has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Harold Baer Jr. rejected efforts by the city  
to dismiss claims in a $20 million lawsuit brought by the child's 
parents, Anette Sorensen and Exavier Wardlaw. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple was arrested in May 1997 after police saw their  
14-month-old daughter, Liv, in a stroller outside a restaurant in 
Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple said they could see their daughter from inside, and  
defended their actions as commonplace in Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Sorensen and Wardlaw were jailed for two nights, and their  
daughter was placed in foster care for four days. Charges of child 
endangerment against the couple were later dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple sued, claiming their civil rights were violated.  
</P>
<P>
	Baer ruled on Tuesday that a jury should decide whether it was  
appropriate to remove the child from the couple. 
</P>
<P>
	Lorne Bade Goodman, a lawyer for the city, said Thursday the  
city would appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Sorensen, an actress from Copenhagen, had been visiting  
Wardlaw, a movie production assistant who lives in New York City.

<HEADLINE> Little Returns to Rams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MACOMB, Ill. (AP) -- A little more than a month after St. Louis  
Rams linebacker Leonard Little pleaded guilty of involuntary 
manslaughter, he was back on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	He knows, though, that it'll never be the same. As immersed in  
football as Little is, with the Rams scheduling players from 6:15 
a.m. wakeup call until 11 p.m. lights out, he can't block out the 
circumstances that ended one life and turned his inside out. 
</P>
<P>
	Little had been drinking while celebrating his 24th birthday  
with teammates the night of Oct. 19 when he ran a red light and his 
Lincoln Navigator crashed into a car driven by Susan Gutweiler, 47, 
of Oakville, Mo. Gutweiler died the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Little's blood alcohol level was nearly twice  
the legal limit. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's always going to be in the back of my mind, for the rest  
of my life,'' Little said after the first of two workouts Friday as 
camp officially opened. ``I made a mistake that I'll never 
forget.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Little has served 21 days of a 90-day sentence imposed as part  
of his June 16 plea agreement, on a work-release basis in which he 
spent only the night in jail. The NFL also suspended him without 
pay -- about $125,000 -- for eight games for violating the league's 
substance abuse policy, although he's able to practice and 
participate in exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Really, right now I'm just refreshing my memory,'' Little  
said. ``I still remember most of the stuff from last year. It's a 
matter of me coming out here and remembering stuff and going 
through it full speed because I'm not going to play for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Little got a warm reception from teammates, many who tapped him  
on the shoulder before the first practice of training camp. Coach 
Dick Vermeil gave him a big hug. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to have him out there,'' cornerback Dexter McCleon  
said. ``Just him being able to get back up here and get his mind on 
something else, do something different, it's good to see. He's 
smiling a little bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Little wasn't allowed to talk about what type of reception he  
might expect in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hoping that they will see he's working very hard not  
only to be the best employee he can be for the Rams but that he can 
be a good citizen,'' his agent, David Ware, said. ``If there are 
fans that are adverse to him, we understand. And if there are fans 
that are supportive, that certainly would be appreciated, also.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vermeil said the Rams had no intention of trading Little, a  
third-round pick in last year's draft out of Tennessee. Little 
played in six games before the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would never presume to tell the Rams what to do about  
that,'' Ware said. ``He's never asked to be traded, and the Rams 
have never discussed that with us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the jail time, Little must serve four years  
probation, submit to drug and alcohol testing, perform 1,000 hours 
of community service and work with Mothers Against Drunk Driving. 
The suspension runs through the game of Nov. 7.

<HEADLINE> Famed Civil Rights Judge Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Frank M. Johnson Jr., a federal judge  
who issued key rulings that helped bring down racial barriers 
across the South and improved the treatment of prisoners and mental 
patients, died Friday of pneumonia. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, a Republican appointee who became a hero of the civil  
rights movement and a target of then-Gov. George C. Wallace's 
segregationist attacks, spent nearly 25 years on the U.S. district 
court bench in Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
	His rulings, beginning with a pivotal 1956 decision that marked  
a victory for the Montgomery bus boycott, outlawed segregation 
across a wide spectrum -- on public transportation and in parks, 
restaurants, libraries and schools. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1960s, he signed the original order to integrate the  
University of Alabama, and he participated in the decision that 
ultimately became the ``one man, one vote'' principle established 
by the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the most dramatic orders of his career, Johnson  
cleared the way for Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and swelling ranks 
of voting rights marchers to make their historic 1965 march from 
Selma to Montgomery despite Wallace's attempt to block it. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite accolades from civil rights groups, Johnson insisted  
throughout his career that he was simply following the law and was 
hardly a liberal. He also showed firm resolve despite the violence 
of the times. A cross was once burned on his lawn, and his mother's 
house was bombed. 
</P>
<P>
	``He stood steady in the fiercest of political storms when he  
believed he was right,'' Gov. Don Siegelman said. ``He helped shape 
the course of this state and this country through his staunch 
defense of the rule of law. His loss will be felt by many.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking slowly with a country, gravel-voiced drawl, Johnson  
could strike fear in lawyers as he looked down from the bench, 
peering steel-eyed over reading glasses and issuing no-nonsense 
instructions. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1970s, Johnson ruled that Alabama's state mental  
hospitals were ``human warehouses.'' He issued far-reaching orders 
establishing the right of patients to receive adequate care and 
spelling out in detail how Alabama had to end bad conditions for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, he found Alabama's prisons ``barbaric'' and ordered a  
sweeping overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was nominated to be FBI director by President Carter in  
1977 but eventually withdrew because of health problems. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1979, he was named to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,  
which later became the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where he 
finished his judicial career. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson attended the University of Alabama Law School, where he  
became friends with the man who later would become the most 
outspoken foe of his court -- Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace fueled his rise to the governor's office with verbal  
attacks on Johnson -- once calling the Alabama-born judge a 
``scalawaging, carpetbagging, integrating liar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, after Johnson's orders for statewide desegregation of  
schools and the sweeping reforms in mental hospitals and prisons, 
became known to many as ``the real governor of Alabama.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In my opinion, he will go down as the greatest federal judge  
in the history of our country,'' said Montgomery U.S. Circuit Judge 
Joel Dubina, who has known Johnson since 1973. ``He was a great, 
great man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he was appointed by President Eisenhower to the district  
court in Montgomery in 1955, Johnson was 37 and the youngest 
federal judge in the country. Barely a year later, he joined in the 
2-1 ruling that outlawed segregation of public transportation, 
giving King and the bus boycott in Montgomery a victory that helped 
jump-start the civil rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``My pride as an Alabamian is a matter of roots,'' Johnson said  
at an event honoring him in 1984. ``But it is a pride that has been 
enhanced, and continues to be enhanced, by the enormous progress in 
the past 25 to 30 years in Alabama ... the securing of 
constitutional rights of all Alabamians regardless of race, creed, 
color or sex.''

<HEADLINE> Reform Party Holds Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Jesse Ventura has never showered credit  
on the Reform Party for his political success. 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't mean the Minnesota governor doesn't care who leads  
his party, or who may seek the presidency under its banner. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, who was scheduled to speak tonight as the party's  
convention begins in Dearborn, Mich., said his role is to show that 
a vote for a third party isn't wasted. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the leadership role that I'll take out there,'' said  
the former professional wrestler who fears back and leg pains may 
keep him away from the convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Delegates are to select a new chairman this weekend, a step that  
will shape not only the party's direction but who it will endorse 
in the 2000 presidential race. The party has more than $12 million 
in federal funds for its candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Current chairman Russell Verney, an ally of party founder Ross  
Perot, decided against seeking another two-year term. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura has endorsed Jack Gargan of Cedar Key, Fla., for the  
chairman's post. Gargan, a 68-year-old retired financial 
consultant, founded T.H.R.O. (Throw The Hypocritical Rascals Out) 
and is considered by many to be the father of the national term 
limits movement. 
</P>
<P>
	While Perot declined an interview request, Verney said Perot  
will support ``whomever the delegates select.''

	Ventura has said he's against Perot again becoming the party's

<HEADLINE> June Budget Surplus $53.57 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government recorded a budget  
surplus in June that partly reflects the flow of money into the 
U.S. Treasury from quarterly corporate income tax payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department said Thursday that the budget surplus  
last month totaled $53.57 billion, up slightly from the $51.11 
billion surplus recorded in June 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate tax payments totaled $39.26 billion in June, and  
individual income tax receipts totaled $92.99 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of fiscal 1999, which began Oct. 1,  
1998, the government surplus totaled $94.28 billion, up from $67.07 
billion for the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration is forecasting a surplus of $99  
billion for all of 1999, and congressional accountants are 
predicting a surplus of about $120 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The May deficit of $23.97 billion was not revised by the  
government, the Treasury Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, government receipts totaled $199.48 billion, compared  
with $187.86 billion a year earlier. Outlays totaled $145.91 
billion in June, up from $136.75 billion for June 1998.

<HEADLINE>  Baseball Hires 10 New Umps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Signaling that it's prepared to let squabbling  
umpires depart, baseball hired 10 minor league umps to take their 
place later this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Bud Selig and his top officials, in their first  
response to the umpires' mass resignations, decided Thursday to 
hire the Triple-A replacements, who had been working as vacation 
fill-ins. 
</P>
<P>
	They were notified they were being added to major league staffs  
on a permanent basis starting Sept. 1 -- the day before the 
resignations of the current umps take effect. 
</P>
<P>
	The bickering umpires have split into two camps -- those for and  
against union head Richie Phillips. The faction backing him is 
mostly in the National League. 
</P>
<P>
	Some are having a hard time deciding whether to follow Phillips.  
For example, American League ump Greg Kosc resigned, withdrew the 
resignation, then quit again. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, 33 of the 36 NL umpires plan to quit, according to a  
count by The Associated Press, but only about half of the AL's 32 
umpires plan to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires on each side have been pressuring their wavering  
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of this is all posturing, negotiating tactics,'' said AL  
ump Tim McClelland, who hasn't quit yet, but says he intends to. 
``You have to take it with a grain of salt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's decision to hire new umpires wasn't expected so soon.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's part of their strategy, but I don't know what their  
strategy is yet,'' Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, 51 major league umpires held a conference call  
Thursday to discuss their position, NL umpire Bruce Froemming said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's a lot more solidarity than there was two or  
three days ago,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, there were some umpires who think Phillips has to go.  
</P>
<P>
	``I am adamantly opposed to this kind of leadership,'' said the  
AL's Dave Phillips, who is no relation to the union head. ``There 
are times when you pull out your gun, your mortar and go 
winner-take-all. But communication and negotiation are the most 
important ingredients we need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richie Phillips said he has been opposed by an AL faction that  
existed since before the 1995 lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	``They do not like me personally, do not like my style and  
believe I'm too confrontational a lawyer,'' he said. ``The media is 
providing them with a forum. Fifty-five guys say Richie Phillips is 
the greatest thing that ever happened to officiating in any sport 
and has won battle after battle after battle for us since 1978.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to hire the new umpires came after virtually every  
top baseball official went to Milwaukee to meet with Selig, a group 
that included NL president Len Coleman, AL president Gene Budig, 
chief operating officer Paul Beeston, executive vice president 
Sandy Alderson and five lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Though baseball didn't announce the hirings, they were confirmed  
by Richie Phillips and several baseball officials. Selig declined 
comment, saying he would discuss the umpires at another time.

<HEADLINE> Taco Bell Offering Pizza Hut Pizza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Can the Taco Bell chihuahua say,  
``Personal Pan Pizza''? 
</P>
<P>
	Customers at dozens of Taco Bell restaurants from California to  
New York can now order the Pizza Hut individual-serving pizzas to 
go with Mexican fare. 
</P>
<P>
	The pizza-taco combination is the latest experiment by Tricon  
Global Restaurants Inc., which owns both chains, to offer one-stop 
shopping for consumers looking for variety. Tricon says it plans to 
introduce the personal pizzas soon at some chicken restaurants at 
its third chain, KFC. 
</P>
<P>
	``The concept provides greater convenience for our consumers,''  
Amy Sherwood, a spokeswoman for Louisville-based Tricon, said 
Friday. ``We're very encouraged by the early results and envision 
expanding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Laurie Gannon, a spokeswoman for Taco Bell in Irvine, Calif.,  
said the multibranding could silence family debates about where to 
eat out. 
</P>
<P>
	``It kind of helps the family that can't agree on one place to  
go to dinner,'' she said. ``This gives the variety of Mexican and 
pizza.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pizza has been added to the menu at 60 Taco Bells in California,  
Colorado, Georgia, New York and Florida, Gannon said. The pizzas, 
along with breadsticks, are offered for dine-in and drive-through 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Pizza sales are ranging from $3,000 to $10,000 a week at each of  
the restaurants in the tests, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	One analyst said the taco-pizza gambit solidifies Tricon's  
position as a leader in multibranding, offering a combination of 
brands under one roof to enhance customer convenience and build 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a positive,'' said Andrew Barish, restaurant  
analyst for BancBoston Robertson Stephens. ``It's trying to drive 
more sales and better returns out of existing assets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Offering pizza at Taco Bell should also help Pizza Hut, Barish  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Personal Pan Pizza is a real asset for Pizza Hut, and anything  
that helps drive sales of that would be good for the pizza brand in 
general,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tricon's blending of brands shouldn't erode the products'  
identity with consumers, Barish said. 
</P>
<P>
	``These were already strong consumer brands that are obviously  
very well known,'' he said. ``I don't think it's going to lose the 
image or appeal of the brand. It gives people flexibility and 
variety, which is what a lot of people like these days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tricon also has taken the multibranding in another direction.  
</P>
<P>
	It has 10 restaurants that sell chicken, tacos and pizza under  
the same roof, with all three brands on the marquee, Gannon said. 
Tricon also has 400 stores selling a combination of two brands, she 
said.

<HEADLINE> Pirates Trade Guillen to Tampa Bay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Pirates, in desperate need of  
catchers, traded outfielder Jose Guillen and a minor league pitcher 
to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays on Friday for two minor league 
catchers. 
</P>
<P>
	In return for Guillen and right-handed pitcher Jeff Sparks, the  
Pirates pick up Joe Oliver and Humberto Cota. Oliver will join the 
Pirates in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ecstatic,'' Oliver said. ``I'm really happy about it.  
Pittsburgh is a really good city to be in -- baseball is really 
starting to take off again. These guys are playing really good 
baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh catcher Jason Kendall is out for the season after  
dislocating his ankle just before the All-Star game. Backup Keith 
Osik went on the disabled list after pulling a hamstring Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Oliver, who turns 34 on Saturday, has spent the 1999 season with  
the Devil Rays' AAA affiliate in Durham, where he batted .301 with 
seven home runs and 43 RBIs in 57 games. He previously played for 
Seattle, Detroit and Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a big opportunity for me,'' Oliver said. ``Hopefully I  
can stay healthy and do what I can behind the plate and add 
whatever I possibly can offensively.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cota, 20, has spent the season with Charleston, S.C. in the  
South Atlantic League, batting .280 with nine home runs and a 
team-leading 61 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Guillen, 23, struggled with the Pirates this season after  
driving in 84 runs last year in his second full season in the 
majors. He joined the Pirates late in spring training because of 
visa problems and was twice sent to Pittsburgh's AAA affiliate in 
Nashville, most recently in June, to recover his batting stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	Guillen, once considered a future star, made the surprising leap  
to the majors from Class A ball in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Sparks, 27, joined the Pirates as a minor league free agent in  
January and has spent the season with Nashville, where he is 5-3 
with a 3.83 ERA and 69 strikeouts in 34 appearances.

<HEADLINE> Capitol Security Needs Improvement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Members of Congress and the police who guard  
them say they are still concerned about safety at the U.S. Capitol 
a year after a gunman forced his way into the building and fatally 
shot two officers on duty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Security has been a growing concern,'' said veteran U.S.  
Capitol Police Officer Larry Schaefer, who is organizing a memorial 
vigil tonight to honor Officer Jacob J. Chestnut of Fort 
Washington, Md., and Detective John M. Gibson of Woodbridge, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress held a memorial service Thursday for the two officers  
and dedicated a plaque in their honor. It will hang near the East 
front of the Capitol, where Chestnut was shot. Gibson was shot a 
short distance away, near the office of House Majority Whip Tom 
DeLay. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have not released the findings of an internal  
investigation into the shootings, and Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., 
said he wants some answers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been one year since the tragedy occurred, and to date  
details about what happened and how it happened have not been 
forthcoming,'' he wrote in a letter to Sergeant at Arms James 
Ziglar. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said his tribute to the slain officers would be to  
uncover the facts and prevent future tragedies. 
</P>
<P>
	But Capitol Police spokesman Dan Nichols said police are  
reluctant to talk about the case, because the man arrested, Russell 
Weston Jr., has not been tried. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge ruled that Weston, diagnosed as a paranoid  
schizophrenic, is incompetent to stand trial. He is being held at a 
federal prison medical facility. 
</P>
<P>
	Schaefer said he believes the investigation will reveal that  
Chestnut could have been better protected. ``He was the only 
officer at that door,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	There were at least two officers at each entrance to the  
building Thursday, but Capitol Police Spokesman Dan Nichols said 
officers must work overtime to ensure that level of security. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 1,076 officers on the Capitol force when the  
shootings occurred. The department now has 1,124 officers, and 
Congress has authorized the hiring of another 200, Nichols said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he acknowledged recruitment and training are slow-going.  
</P>
<P>
	Nichols and other Capitol police officers said a visitor's  
center outside the Capitol would enhance security. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea surfaced in 1991 and again in 1995. After the  
shootings, Congress approved $100 million for the project but has 
released just $2.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Architect of the Capitol Alan Hantman is redesigning the plan to  
meet security needs, but Congress still must decide who should 
oversee the project. 
</P>
<P>
	If built, the center would require visitors to go through a  
security check outside the Capitol. Visitors and staff now are 
checked inside entrances. Some tourists said they would be upset if 
it limited their access to Congress or created more lines.

<HEADLINE> Govt: Researcher Faked Cancer Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A scientist whose 1992 study linking  
high-voltage power lines to cancer contributed to public fears was 
found to have faked his data and has left the Lawrence Berkeley 
National Laboratory, the government said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard P. Liburdy had claimed to have found a link between the  
electromagnetic fields around power lines and certain cellular 
changes in the body. 
</P>
<P>
	After a whistle-blower complained, the federal Office of  
Research Integrity investigated and concluded that Liburdy had 
committed scientific misconduct by tossing out data that did not 
support his conclusions, said the agency's director, Chris Pascal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The evidence demonstrates Liburdy knew his data manipulations  
were significant to the conclusions of the paper,'' the agency 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Liburdy, a 51-year-old cellular biologist who lives in Tiburon,  
outside San Francisco, resigned his 15-year position in March after 
losing his funding, the San Francisco Chronicle said. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, he agreed to ask the scientific journals that published  
his work to retract three key graphs. Liburdy, who had received 
$3.3 million in federal grants for his research, also agreed to a 
three-year ban on receiving federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
	However, in a letter in last month's issue of the journal  
Science, he denied doing anything wrong other than failing to 
explain his graphing procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	``My scientific conclusions stand as published,'' Liburdy wrote.  
``I admit no scientific wrongdoing. I could not afford a protracted 
legal battle with the ORI, and a settlement was reached by which I 
admit no liability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three independent scientists who evaluated the facts at  
Liburdy's request supported him, the Chronicle reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Liburdy did not respond Friday to a request for comment faxed to  
his home by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility that electromagnetic fields can cause childhood  
leukemia and other illnesses has raised fears among people living 
near high-tension power lines. 
</P>
<P>
	The theory had been raised well before Liburdy's study, but he  
found what was thought to be the first plausible biological 
explanation for such a connection. However, at least 20 subsequent 
studies failed to find any conclusive link of the sort he 
described. 
</P>
<P>
	Some statistical studies that looked at the rate of cancer among  
people living near power lines have indicated that it is more 
common among those exposed to electromagnetic fields. 
</P>
<P>
	But according to the National Institute of Environmental Health  
Science, virtually all of the laboratory studies of animals and 
humans ``fail to support a causal relationship.'' At the same time, 
the agency has said that invisible fields created by power lines 
``cannot be recognized as entirely safe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Liburdy's studies, published in the Annals of the New York  
Academy of Sciences and FEBS Letters, a publication of the 
Federation of European Biochemical Societies, tied electric and 
magnetic radiation to calcium signaling, a process responsible for 
a number of cellular functions, including cell division and the 
turning of genes on and off. 
</P>
<P>
	ORI examined Liburdy's raw data and found that in one graph, he  
had used only 7.1 percent of his data. The ORI also said he 
fabricated data. 
</P>
<P>
	``In contrast to the data shown in the figure, the full set of  
primary data does not show that exposure to low-strength 
electromagnetic fields results in an inhibition or in a lower level 
of calcium ions in the cells,'' the ORI reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Raymond Neutra, chief of California's Division of Environmental  
and Occupational Disease, said Liburdy's 1992 research was 
important, but the epidemiological studies that followed are more 
so. 
</P>
<P>
	``His research was not the keystone in the arch,'' Neutra said.  
``That particular piece of research is only tangentially related. 
The extent we're concerned comes from epidemiological research, not 
lab research like Liburdy's.''

<HEADLINE> 'Compassionate' Bush Mantra Puzzles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The jury is out on whether George W. Bush's  
compassionate conservatism is a political tonic or just so much 
fizz. In fact, the jury is way out, making tracks to the beach or 
engaged in other idle summer pursuits. 
</P>
<P>
	But when Americans focus down the road on political choices,  
that credo awaits them. The Texas governor says he'll make his 
stand for the Republican presidential nomination on compassionate 
conservativism. 
</P>
<P>
	But what does it mean?  
</P>
<P>
	``Conservatively compassionate?'' mused Sharon Lyndon, 25,  
pausing to think on the campus of George Washington University in 
Washington. ``I have no idea,'' she concluded, shrugging. ``It 
sounds a little superficial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a good slogan for someone if there was a clear-cut  
definition and everyone knew what it meant,'' says Kyle Rodillas, 
31, a Los Angeles salesman and Republican who votes across party 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mushy,'' offers Sarandis Karathanasis, 27, working a booth at  
a Concord, N.H., fair. ``It's almost like what people want to hear 
-- too much what people want to hear -- a little corny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For all that puzzlement, it's early and Bush is just beginning  
to define what he means. 
</P>
<P>
	He counts tax cuts, higher education standards and welfare  
reform among his conservative touchstones. The compassion ledger is 
said to include aid to schools and students, charitable incentives 
and a dependable but undefined social safety net. 
</P>
<P>
	More specifically, he would spend $8 billion on tax credits and  
grants in a year to encourage charitable giving and support an 
increased role by religious organizations in reducing poverty, 
welfare and crime. He would summon America's ``armies of 
compassion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some scholars see the phrase as a pretty frame for a largely  
blank policy canvas. Others say a mutation is going on in politics, 
a drift toward the center that has seen liberals abandon their 
ideological label and conservatives starting to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
	Unqualified conservatism has become identified with unyielding  
Republican leadership in Congress, personified in the House by 
former speaker Newt Gingrich, Majority Whip Tom DeLay and Majority 
Leader Dick Armey, said Wayne Fields, a professor at Washington 
University in St. Louis who has studied presidential speechmaking. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are exterminators,'' he said. ``Zealots don't believe in  
synthesis. That's not how George Bush built a career. He's saying, 
'I'm not one of them.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush consistently scores high in polls on leadership qualities,  
including his identification with problems of ordinary people. But 
polls also find Americans don't yet know him well.

	In a June poll by Princeton Survey Research Associates, 51  
percent of respondents said -- when offered the phrase -- that 
compassionate conservative describes Bush. Thirty-one percent 
didn't know. 
</P>
<P>
	``We like to be compassionate,'' said Robin Lakoff, linguistics  
professor at the University of California, Berkeley. ``We don't 
want to seem cruel and hard and unfeeling.'' Still, ``I really have 
a feeling it's one of these phrases that's not intended to have a 
whole lot of meaning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Liberals have their own euphemisms, among them ``progressive.''  
Vice President Al Gore advocates ``practical idealism'' while 
President Clinton still talks about his centrist ``third way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia University presidential historian Henry Graff thinks  
Americans are wearying of catch phrases that seem to get emptier 
with time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how to implement compassionate conservatism,'' he  
said. ``If there's a hurricane that wipes out Tampa, the government 
will send out aid. Presidents have all been compassionate, I 
think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's GOP rivals see red when they hear the phrase. ``Those are  
weasel words,'' Lamar Alexander said. ``I think we need to say in 
plain words, 'I am a conservative.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Vice President Dan Quayle ordered his staff ``never --  
ever -- to utter the words 'compassionate conservative.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``Conservatives ARE compassionate,'' Quayle said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Is compassion beneath us?'' Bush shot back at his critics.  
``Should our party be led by someone who boasts of a hard heart?''

<HEADLINE> Most AL Umps Seem Likely To Stay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- More than two-thirds of American League umpires  
probably will stay on the job rather than resign, though nearly all 
NL umps still plan to quit. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball hired 10 more replacement umps from the minors even  
though four more AL umpires withdrew their resignations on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, 12 of 32 AL umps have changed their mind about quitting,  
and 11 never quit in the first place, according to a count by The 
Associated Press. In the National League, 33 of 36 umpires have 
resigned, effective Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not one or two. This is a big group out there now who  
have rescinded their resignations,'' said Mike Reilly, one of the 
AL umpires who withdrew Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``My decision was based on my family and what I can do best to  
support them. I have four kids, 12 to 7.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following Friday's reversals, 26 of the 68 major league umpires  
now say they're staying, more than one-third. 
</P>
<P>
	The replacements, now totaling 20, are from Triple-A and will be  
added to the major league staff on a permanent basis starting Sept. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Reilly, Rick Reed, Tim Tschida and Larry Young  
also withdrew their resignations Friday, according to several 
management officials who spoke on the condition they not be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
	``In light of the difficulties of the last week, we have simply  
decided to honor the present terms of our contract,'' Reed, 
Tschida, Young and Al Clark said in a joint statement after their 
game in Chicago. Clark withdrew his resignation on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires union head Richie Phillips said, ``There's a lot of  
behind-the-scenes stuff going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips was en route to Cooperstown for this weekend's Hall of  
Fame induction ceremonies, which commissioner Bud Selig also will 
attend, but no talks were scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only news I heard today is that dialog could open the  
whole thing up, when people get off the position that they won't 
talk to our counsel,'' NL umpire Bruce Froemming said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, minor league umpires will ask the National Labor  
Relations Board to hold an organizing election, Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Phillips has said 220 of 228 minor league umps voted to  
form a union, it hasn't been recognized by the National Association 
of Professional Baseball Leagues, the governing body of the minors. 
The only way to force the National Association to deal with the 
union is to have the NLRB conduct a vote by secret ballot, a 
process that usually takes a month or two. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips said the request for an election will be filed with the  
NLRB's Philadelphia office Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires announced mass resignations last week. Bound by a  
no-strike clause, they chose the tactic because they thought owners 
would lock them out after their labor contract expires Dec. 31.

<HEADLINE> Tour de France at a Glance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POITIERS, France (AP) -- A look at Friday's 18th stage of the  
86th Tour de France: 
</P>
<P>
	STAGE: A 117-mile ride from Jonzac to Futuroscope, a futuristic  
science fiction park in central France. 
</P>
<P>
	WINNER: Gianpaolo Mondini of Italy, in 4 hours, 17 minutes, 43  
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	HOW OTHERS FARED: Frenchman Jean-Cyril Robin of France was  
second, and Alexandre Vinokourov of Kazakstan was third. Lance 
Armstrong, the overall leader from Austin, Texas, was 31st. 
</P>
<P>
	OVERALL STANDINGS: Armstrong kept his lead of 6 minutes, 15  
seconds. He's followed by Fernando Escartin of Spain and Alex Zulle 
of Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	TOUR TIDBITS: It was a disappointing day for French riders, who  
haven't had a stage win yet this Tour even though Robin came close 
on Friday. The last time no Frenchman won a stage was in 1926. 
</P>
<P>
	QUOTE OF THE DAY: ``The tactic is to protect the yellow jersey  
from danger. We're in an ideal situation, but we have to be careful 
there isn't an accident.'' -- Johan Bruyneel, director of 
Armstrong's U.S. Postal Service team. 
</P>
<P>
	NEXT STAGE: Saturday's stage is a 35.5-mile time trial in  
Futuroscope.

<HEADLINE> Colts: Top Picks Aren't Set To Sign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TERRE HAUTE, Ind. (AP) -- As the Indianapolis Colts held their  
first training camp workout Friday without the team's top two draft 
picks, club president Bill Polian admitted there was little hope 
either would sign contracts soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Polian said that he and agent Leigh Steinberg were ``very far  
apart'' and that he was not ``hopeful anything will get done any 
time soon'' to bring first-round pick Edgerrin James into camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg did not immediately respond to a telephone message by  
The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	James was the fourth overall pick in the draft. The 6-foot,  
216-pound running back is expected to start this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Essentially, they're asking for the same signing bonus ($11.6  
million) that Peyton (Manning) got, or close to it,'' Polian said. 
``That's not in the ballpark in our opinion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manning, who went on to set NFL rookie passing records for  
completions, yards passing and touchdown passes, was the top pick 
in last year's draft. He signed a six-year deal valued at $48 
million and earned an additional $8 million performance bonus that 
the Colts will have to pay to retain him for the length of the 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker Mike Peterson, the team's second-round draft pick, is  
the only other unsigned rookie. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two players have signed right in front of (Peterson) for  
virtually what we're offering,'' Polian said. ``We've been talking 
with the agent (Steve Weinberg) almost on a consistent basis. That 
one is annoying to say the least. A second-rounder shouldn't be 
holding out. A difference of one percent should not cause a 
holdout.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Polian said he had no idea how long it would be before James,  
who had insisted earlier that he would be in on time, is signed. 
</P>
<P>
	Polian said he and Steinberg were talking ``on a regular basis.  
That's not a problem.''

<HEADLINE> More Accusations Against Ibeabuchi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Now that heavyweight boxer Ike Ibeabuchi is in  
jail on sexual assault charges, authorities are taking another look 
at similar accusations made by another woman in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Ibeabuchi was arrested Thursday after a 21-year-old entertainer  
on call accused him of sexually assaulting her after she was called 
to his hotel suite at The Mirage hotel-casino. 
</P>
<P>
	Ibeabuchi, 20-0 with 15 knockouts and ranked No. 2 by the IBF,  
was jailed on charges of sexual assault and battery with intent to 
commit sexual assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Metro Police Lt. Tom Monahan said Friday another entertainer  
accused Ibeabuchi of sexual assault after the 23-year-old woman 
visited Ibeabuchi in a hotel room at the Treasure Island 
hotel-casino on Dec. 23. The Clark County District Attorney's 
office determined the case lacked evidence, and Ibeabuchi, 26, was 
never arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Monahan said the district attorney's office is now reviewing  
that case because of Ibeabuchi's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Ibeabuchi spent three months in jail in 1998 after pleading  
guilty to false imprisonment charges relating to a 1997 wreck he 
had with a 15-year-old boy in his car in Austin, Texas.

<HEADLINE>  Columbia, Telescope In Orbit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Space shuttle Columbia's astronauts  
flawlessly released the world's most powerful X-ray telescope into 
orbit Friday on the first U.S. space flight commanded by a woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force Col. Eileen Collins announced the news seven hours  
into the shuttle journey: ``Chandra's on its way to open the eyes 
of X-ray astronomy to the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the shuttle launch, which was marred by a short circuit  
and a premature engine cutoff, the release of the $1.5 billion 
Chandra X-ray Observatory went smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
	The gold- and silver-colored, 45-foot telescope gleamed as it  
drifted off into the sunset on a five-year voyage to search for 
signs of black holes and dark matter, and to survey galaxies, 
quasars and erupting stars. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing as beautiful as Chandra sailing off on its  
way to work,'' observed astronaut Cady Coleman, who flipped the 
ejection switch. 
</P>
<P>
	An hour later, a rocket motor propelled the telescope into a  
deliberately lopsided orbit that will eventually have a high point 
of 87,000 miles, or one-third of the way to the moon. It will take 
10 days for the telescope to reach its intended orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	The five astronauts cheered when notified the motor had worked;  
a similar motor malfunctioned on a military satellite in April, and 
everyone was anxious even though Chandra's motor had been altered 
and triple-checked. 
</P>
<P>
	The first images are expected in three to four weeks.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is an absolutely tremendous day for science,'' said Roger  
Brissenden, science flight director at the Chandra control center 
in Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA's space shuttles had never carried such a massive load  
before. Chandra checked in at launch at 50,000 pounds. Once the 
motor peeled away, the telescope was down to its working weight of 
13,000 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins' debut as the first woman to command a U.S. space flight  
since Alan Shepard rocketed away in 1961 was postponed twice this 
week, first by faulty hydrogen measurements, then by lightning. The 
42-year-old former test pilot flew twice before as a shuttle 
co-pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia's 8 1/2-minute climb to orbit was more nerve-racking than  
usual. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins was barely nine seconds into her flight when she radioed  
down that she had a problem with one of the shuttle's fuel cells, 
which use hydrogen and oxygen to generate electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-eight seconds later, after scrutinizing the data, Mission  
Control informed Collins the problem appeared to be a short 
circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop in voltage caused the electronic controller to fail on  
two of Columbia's three main engines. But each engine has a backup 
controller. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Columbia ended up seven miles short of its intended  
orbit when the engines cut off one second early because of an 
insufficient supply of liquid oxygen. But the gap didn't matter for 
Chandra's release. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins' husband, Pat Youngs, who flies for Delta Air Lines,  
held their 3 1/2-year-old daughter, Bridget -- who covered her ears 
from the roar of the rockets -- as he listened to the conversation 
unfolding between his wife and Mission Control. Astronauts standing 
nearby assured him it was ``no big deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If it was real bad, we would have heard a little more  
excitement,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandra should have flown last August but was stalled by  
technical problems. Scientists were nervous as the telescope's 
systems clicked on one by one. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought at any minute something is bound to happen to burst  
our bubble -- but it hasn't yet,'' said Jean Olivier, NASA's deputy 
manager.

<HEADLINE> Report: Van Gundy Gets Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jeff Van Gundy, who coached the New York Knicks  
to the NBA Finals, finally has the two-year contract extension he 
was seeking, the Daily News reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks said no announcement was scheduled. Attempts to reach  
Van Gundy's agent, Ron Ades, were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
	Under his current contract, Van Gundy will be paid $2 million  
next season. By winning the Eastern Conference title last month, a 
$3.5 million extension for the 2000-01 season automatically kicked 
in. The new deal, extending Van Gundy's contract through 2002-03, 
is worth between $8 million and $10 million, a high-ranking NBA 
official told the Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy has a 140-97 record in his four years as head coach,  
all with New York, and is 26-22 in the postseason. He was nearly 
fired in March and April because of disagreements with then Knicks 
president Ernie Grunfeld. 
</P>
<P>
	Grunfeld was fired instead on April 20.  
</P>
<P>
	New York won six of the final eight regular-season games and,  
seeded eighth in the Eastern Conference, beat Miami, Atlanta and 
Indiana in the playoffs before losing to San Antonio in five games 
in the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the postseason, Madison Square Garden president Dave  
Checketts refused to confirm Van Gundy would be his coach next 
season. Checketts pursued former Chicago Bulls coach Phil Jackson, 
who signed with the Los Angeles Lakers last month.

<HEADLINE> Ballet Director Anne Woolliams Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- British ballet director Anne Woolliams, who was  
instrumental in establishing the international reputation of 
Germany's Stuttgart Ballet, has died at age 72. 
</P>
<P>
	She died on July 8 of cancer in Canterbury, Kent, where she had  
settled in 1995 after retiring as artistic director of ballet at 
the Vienna State Opera, her husband, choreographer Jan Stripling, 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout her career she was revered for both her teaching and  
direction. But she also danced in several films and musicals, 
including the 1948 film ``Red Shoes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born in 1926 in the English coastal town of Folkestone, near  
Canterbury, Woolliams trained as a dancer in England and Germany 
and devoted her career to classical ballet. 
</P>
<P>
	She debuted with the Russian Opera and Ballet, and spent several  
years touring with a small English group, the St. James's Ballet, 
before she began teaching. 
</P>
<P>
	John Cranko, director of West Germany's Stuttgart Ballet,  
invited her to join him in 1963 as the company's ballet mistress, 
responsible for classes and rehearsals. 
</P>
<P>
	With Cranko, she helped to develop Stuttgart as a major  
international success and to transform the part-time student 
classes into the country's leading ballet school, now called the 
John Cranko School. 
</P>
<P>
	She was artistic director of the Australian Ballet from 1976 to  
1978, and then first Dean of Dance at Australia's Victorian College 
of the Arts in Melbourne until 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Her book on teaching, ``Ballettsaal,'' was published in Germany  
in 1973 and in English as ``Ballet Studio'' in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in England, Woolliams mostly focused on her other talent,  
painting. 
</P>
<P>
	She is survived by her husband, her brother, James Woolliams,  
and her sister, Wendy White-Tomson.

<HEADLINE> Teacher Suspended in Toy Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) -- A high school economics teacher who offered  
students extra credit if they gave her Teenie Beanie Babies was 
suspended for two months and will be transferred to another school. 
</P>
<P>
	School board members handed out Carol Penland's punishment  
Thursday night. The 25-year veteran -- voted Teacher of the Year in 
1998 at Campbell High School in Smyrna -- will seek a court 
injunction to stop the suspension, her lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Penland offered extra points to students who brought her  
money to buy McDonald's Happy Meals and allowed her to keep the 
toys the restaurant included. Students who gave Ms. Penland a 
Teenie Beanie Baby received even more points. 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer, Terry Thomas, said Ms. Penland planned to give the  
toys to foster children. He said she also has offered extra credit 
to students who participated in blood and food drives.

<HEADLINE> Some Criticize 'Practical Shooting' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Assault rifles, semiautomatic handguns and  
shotguns don't always count as weapons in Nick Alexakos' 
vocabulary, especially when he's trying to get them into the 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexakos is president of the International Practical Shooting  
Confederation, and he rebuffs gun control advocates who say the 
high-intensity sport of practical shooting doesn't belong in the 
Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't deal with weapons,'' Alexakos said. ``We deal with  
recreational implements. A weapon is more how you use something 
than what it is. A baseball bat could be used a weapon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexakos, who has been lobbying the International Olympic  
Committee, was responding to a campaign launched Thursday by the 
Violence Policy Center. Philip Alpers, who researched the sport for 
the center, said there were political motives behind practical 
shooting's bid for Olympic acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not paintball,'' Alpers said. ``There is a very  
serious political purpose behind this, and that is to legitimize 
the civilian ownership of lethal firearms, which are normally kept 
only for battlefields and SWAT teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In practical shooting, formerly known as combat shooting,  
participants racing against the clock use high-powered guns to 
shoot human-shaped targets in simulated scenarios. For instance, 
the shooter may start lying down -- as if in bed -- and then get up 
to grab a handgun from a drawer and use it to shoot at targets 
through a window. 
</P>
<P>
	The sport is practiced in about 70 countries, according to  
Alexakos. It will be an exhibition sport at the 2004 Games in 
Athens at the invitation of Greek organizers and outside of the 
official IOC program. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Olympic Committee issued a statement today  
from its headquarters in Switzerland saying it is ``surprised and 
concerned about misleading statements being made from numerous 
sources about practical shooting's chances of being recognized as 
an Olympic sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``The International Practical Shooting Confederation is not a  
federation recognized by the IOC. The International Shooting Sport 
Federation is recognized by the IOC and conducts the shooting 
competitions at the Olympic Games. The ISSF does not recognize 
practical shooting as a discipline. Practical shooting will not be 
a part of the Olympic program in Athens in 2004. There are no 
exhibition or demonstration events at the Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IPSC has applied to the IOC to become a recognized  
federation, but this application is not being actively 
considered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Josh Sugarmann, executive director of the Violence Policy  
Center, contends the sport's mere existence presents a convenient 
way to skirt laws that prohibit the trade of certain weapons unless 
they are used for sporting purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugarmann also expressed concern over the sport's popularity  
with youngsters, noting that Andrew Golden, the 11-year-old boy who 
was a participant in the Jonesboro, Ark., school shooting last 
year, had taken up practical shooting shortly before the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	``Combat shooting doesn't just violate the goals of the Olympic  
charter, it's an effort by the gun industry and the gun lobby to 
entice kids and help create a youth gun culture,'' Sugarmann said. 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Hollar, president of the 14,000-member U.S. Practical  
Shooting Association, said his organization has no such agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need to understand that we're not a political  
organization; we're a sporting organization,'' Hollar said from 
USPSA headquarters in Sedro Woolley, Wash. ``People are going to 
look at our sport and read into it whatever they want to. We can't 
control that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexakos conceded that practical shooting is a ``long shot'' to  
make it to the Summer Games, but he said its athletes would measure 
up well if ever given a chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking about the same dedication and same commitment  
you find in any Olympic sport,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Skinner Happy With All Pocono News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG POND, Pa. (AP) -- That man doing all the smiling at Pocono  
International Raceway is Mike Skinner. 
</P>
<P>
	He began practice Friday secure in the knowledge that crew chief  
Larry McReynolds will be with him for three more years. Then 
qualifying began, and Skinner took his Chevrolet out and won the 
pole for Sunday's Pennsylvania 500. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say it was a perfect lap, but it was a good one,''  
said Skinner, whose only other Winston Cup poles were for both 
Daytona races as a rookie in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	And it was just one more thing to celebrate. Before touring the  
2 1/2-mile triangle at 170.451 mph, Skinner said little could ruin a 
day on which McReynolds announced that in the wake of his ill-fated 
attempt to start his own team he would remain with Richard 
Childress Racing through 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, I feel like a winner in this deal,'' Skinner said  
of the news. ``I'm pretty pumped up about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he channeled his enthusiasm once he took the green flag to  
start his run around NASCAR's flattest oval, on which he has had 
problems in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``We left a little on the table in turn one, and we probably  
left a little bit there in turn two,'' Skinner said. ``But we 
killed three.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That turn, the flattest of them all with just 6 degrees of  
banking, has been his undoing in five previous qualifying attempts 
on the mountaintop. He was surprised when that broad turn was his 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if we haven't conquered anything, we conquered three,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't by accident, however. Skinner and McReynolds made a  
lot of changes during both practice sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Skinner wasn't sure the chassis alterations would be  
enough. Despite his affection for his crew chief, the 42-year-old 
Californian was ready to share the blame. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said to Larry if we qualified 25th, we did it together,''  
Skinner said. ``He said we'd be doing it together for the next 
three years. He's a cheerleader, and the backbone of the whole 
thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Second was the Ford of Mark Martin, who got around at 170.078.  
Next came the Chevy of five-time Pocono polesitter Ken Schrader at 
169.933. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, without a pole this year after three last season and 38  
in his career, is still recovering from multiple fractures received 
three weeks ago in practice at Daytona. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not nearly as distracted as I was up in New Hampshire with  
the pain,'' said Martin, who started 37th and finished sixth two 
weeks ago in the Jiffy Lube 300. ``I gave them everything I had on 
that lap, and they gave me a great car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schrader was unmoved when informed that the third starting  
position has been the most productive of all with eight victories 
in 43 Pocono races. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's one of those statistical things that don't make much  
difference when we race Sunday,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourth on the grid for the $2.2 million race was the Pontiac of  
Bobby Labonte, the winner last month of the Pocono 500. Labonte's 
lap was run at 169.827. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are awfully excited about that,'' he said. ``It was a  
little bit better than we anticipated. But I used up a lot of the 
track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sterling Marlin was the most disappointed of those who got in  
when positions 1-25 were set for the 43-car field. He established a 
track qualifying record at 170.506 last month and was fastest 
Friday in both practice sessions. Yet he qualified only ninth in a 
Chevy at 169.444. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tightened the car up a little bit from practice,'' he said.  
``But the clouds were out, and we were a little too tight in turn 
one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fifth was the Pontiac of John Andretti, and then came the Chevys  
of Hendrick Motorsports teammates Wally Dallenbach and Jeff Gordon. 
Ward Burton was eighth in a Pontiac, followed by Marlin and the 
Chevy of Joe Nemechek. 
</P>
<P>
	Series points leader Dale Jarrett was 15th in a Ford.

<HEADLINE> Akin Finally No. 1 in Wrestling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Eric Akin seeks no sympathy for all  
his close calls as a wrestler, though he certainly deserves some. 
</P>
<P>
	Time and time again Akin has been on the verge of becoming the  
top guy at his weight, only to be denied at the last moment. It 
happened in the NCAA championships when he was at Iowa State and 
continued through his freestyle career -- at the national 
championships, at the Olympic trials and at the world team trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Always a runner-up, never a champion -- until now.  
</P>
<P>
	Akin is on the eight-man U.S. freestyle team that will compete  
in the Pan American Games next week. He earned the spot at 119 
pounds at the world team trials in Seattle, where he defeated two 
wrestlers responsible for most of his crushing defeats, Sammie 
Henson and Lou Rosselli. 
</P>
<P>
	Those victories finally made Akin No. 1, at the age of 28, the  
father of two, with another due on Thanksgiving Day. He certainly 
would have liked being there earlier, but he's not feeling sorry 
for himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``It bothers other people a lot more than it does me,'' Akin  
said. ``They keep seeing that I'm second all the time, second all 
the time, but I've been watching this sport since I was 10 years 
old and I've seen guys be fifth or sixth for 10 years in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	``So second isn't that bad,'' he said. ``I get a little stipend  
from USA Wrestling and they've kept me up there as one of their top 
guys. It's OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's a lot better now. Akin, who had been 0-3 against Rosselli  
this year, beat him 2-1 and 5-3 in the finals of the world team 
trials on June 19. In addition to giving Akin a berth on the Pan Am 
team, those victories put Akin in the world championships in 
Ankara, Turkey in October. 
</P>
<P>
	In a non-Olympic year, a world championship is the ultimate in  
international wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Pan Am Games are great, but this is basically training for  
me,'' Akin said. ``My goal is to win a world title. I want to be a 
world champion and a Olympic champion. This is just a step.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the longest time, Akin never had a chance to take that step.  
</P>
<P>
	His litany of second-place finishes goes back to his senior year  
at Iowa State, when he lost to Henson in the 1994 NCAA finals. Two 
years later, he lost to Rosselli in the finals of the Olympic 
Trials. They had split their first two matches in the best-of-3 
series and were battling on even terms in the third match when Akin 
slipped on a wet spot and Rosselli jumped on him for the decisive 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	``I surprised a lot of people at the trials. I surprised  
myself,'' Akin said. ``I didn't go down there prepared to be on the 
Olympic team and then I got down to the final match. I saw how 
close I was. I must have watched those films a hundred times, and I 
realized I did a lot of good things. It made me train even harder 
to stay in the sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it didn't put him over the top. He finished third at the  
U.S. nationals in 1997 and 1998 and was second at last year's world 
team trials, losing to Henson in the finals. This year, he lost to 
Rosselli in the finals of the U.S. nationals, a match that went 
just as Akin had hoped -- until the end. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took a good shot on him and I was half a second from a  
takedown,'' Akin said. ``I thought, `Oh, I'm going to score.' Then 
I kind of relaxed and he got me on my hip and exposed my back. He 
got two points and that was the match.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the world trials and Akin's redemption. He beat Henson  
3-1 to win the mini-tournament and earn a shot at Rosselli, who was 
no match for Akin this time. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the first match, I didn't get real aggressive,'' he said.  
``At the end, I capitalized on a shot and beat him. We played chess 
in that match. The second match, I knew his knee was hurting and I 
kept taking shots. I took him down four times. That was more than 
any other match I've had with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Akin hasn't let up since then. He admits to being ``almost  
psycho'' about his training, because he's afraid he'll get out of 
shape if he misses just one day. But he will take a break after the 
Pan Am Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``One night when I get back I'm going to go out and eat pizza,''  
Akin said. ``I might pack it on pretty good that night, and then 
I'll probably pay for it for three days. I'm more nervous about 
that than I am about the Pan Ams.''

<HEADLINE> Strawberry Works Out, Still Waiting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Darryl Strawberry arrived at the New York  
Yankees' minor league complex today saying he was focused on his 
daily workout and not the status of his 120-day suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've basically been taking care of myself,'' said Strawberry.  
``I think that's really the most important part of my life right 
now. When the time comes for Mr. Selig to make his decision, I'll 
be ready to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Bud Selig had planned on Thursday to review the  
suspension which runs until August 11. The commissioner's office 
said the matter was not addressed because Selig was dealing with 
the threat of a mass resignation by the umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry began his third week of workouts today.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel real good. I feel like I've gotten myself in good  
shape,'' Strawberry said. ``I feel healthy and things are going in 
a positive way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very positive here. I've surrounded myself with good  
people and allowed myself to do the things I need to do in my 
program and that's the most important thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry was suspended after he pleaded no contest to cocaine  
possession and solicitation charges last spring. Selig had said he 
would review the case July 22 because of ``mitigating health 
factors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry was recovering from colon cancer surgery and taking  
chemotherapy at the time of his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig does not plan to alter Strawberry's status, according to a  
baseball official speaking on the condition he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	That means Strawberry will continue working out at the Tampa  
complex until the 37-year-old outfielder becomes eligible to join 
one of New York's minor league teams on Aug. 12.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- At the stately church where Jacqueline Kennedy  
Onassis often found solace, friends and relatives remembered her 
son John Fitzgerald Kennedy Jr. and his wife today at a private 
Mass. An invitation-only group of about 350, including President 
Clinton and his family, entered the Church of St. Thomas More in 
Manhattan. Dr. Richard Freeman and his wife, Ann, the stepfather 
and mother of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and Lauren Bessette, were 
among the first to arrive, followed later by Kennedy's sister, 
Caroline, and uncle, Sen. Edward Kennedy. Others included JFK Jr. 
hero Muhammad Ali, hip-hop artist Wyclef Jean, cousins Robert F. 
Kennedy Jr. and Maria Shriver, her husband, Arnold Schwarzenegger, 
and former U.S. Sen. Alan Simpson.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Cautious on Predictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft folks call it the ``Woe-is-Me'' talk.  
Or the ``Prozac Speech.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's the admonition Chief Financial Officer Greg Maffei gives  
whenever industry analysts gather to hear predictions of how the 
software giant might fare in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Invariably, Maffei follows long-standing company tradition and  
does all he can to downplay expectations of the phenomenal growth 
Microsoft has enjoyed in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	His speech Thursday at Microsoft's annual financial analysts'  
conference was no exception. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Microsoft announced that revenues for its fiscal year  
that ended June 30 reached $19.75 billion, up 29 percent from the 
year before. Profit totaled $7.79 billion or $1.42 a share, up 69 
percent from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	As he did Monday, Maffei again sang the blues, predicting lower  
revenue growth next year, the need for huge new investments and the 
difficulty in cutting costs further. However, contradicting some 
other Microsoft executives -- including his boss, Chairman Bill 
Gates -- Maffei said he thinks Microsoft may bounce back in fiscal 
year 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	For the just-begun fiscal year 2000, Maffei said he anticipates  
revenue growth of no more than two-thirds of what it was last year. 
He added that Gates and president Steve Ballmer think it will be no 
more than half of last year's growth, or around 15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballmer reacted to predictions by some analysts that revenue  
would continue to grow by 25 percent or more by saying: ``Come on, 
it's outlandish. It's crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maffei said big new sources of revenue for Microsoft won't show  
up until the end of this fiscal year, if then. The company hopes to 
bring out Windows 2000, its long-delayed operating system for 
high-powered computers and corporate networks, by the end of 
December. But Maffei said money from that product likely won't flow 
in immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Microsoft expects Windows 2000 to eventually be its  
flagship product, ``I don't think this is going to be a product 
like Windows 95 where people line up at midnight to get it,'' 
Maffei said. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft has little room to cut its manufacturing costs much  
further, he said. It benefitted when the industry switched from 
floppy disks to the much-cheaper CD-ROMs as a way of delivering 
software, and as more customers began receiving new programs by 
direct download. But those transitions have been largely completed 
-- ``The easy money has been made,'' Maffei said. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft will boost its research and development spending this  
fiscal year to $3.8 billion from $3.1 billion, and plans to spend 
$1 billion more on sales and marketing than the $3.2 billion it 
spent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	It also is hiring thousands of new people and is adopting a new  
compensation plan aimed at putting employees in the top 65 percent 
of the industry's pay, rather than the current 50 percent. Though 
the higher pay will add $200 million in costs, executives said it 
is necessary to retain employees who in the past might have 
accepted lower salaries along with the chance of huge gains in 
stock options. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft now employs about 31,400 people, an increase of more  
than 4,300 in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft recently became the first corporation to pass a half  
trillion dollars in market capitalization -- the value of the stock 
price times the number of shares outstanding. Maffei said there's 
no guarantee the stock will continue to go up.

	Still, Maffei said in a question and answer period that ``I'm on

Windows 2000 will be an established product and Year 2000 worries

<HEADLINE> Plaza for Surveyor Suggested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Capital Memorial Commission  
balked Thursday at putting a monument to Benjamin Banneker, the 
surveyor George Washington picked to help lay out the boundaries of 
the capital, at a circle already bearing his name. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the commission agreed to ask the National Park Service  
and the Washington city government to consider redoing L'Enfant 
Plaza, a little-used promenade, to include a Banneker memorial. The 
plaza is named for Maj. Pierre L'Enfant, who planned the city. 
</P>
<P>
	A memorial for Banneker was approved last year by Congress and  
President Clinton. Peggy C. Seats of the non-profit Washington 
Interdependence Council told the memorial commission Banneker 
Circle would be an ideal site for it. But Charles Atherton, 
secretary of the capital's Fine Arts Commission, said the memorial 
would mot be enough to draw a large number of tourists to that 
area. 
</P>
<P>
	A rehabilitated L'Enfant Plazaq promenade could link the green  
Mall between the Capitol and the Lincoln Memorial to hotels and 
restaurants on the waterfront along Washington Channel, an inlet of 
the Potomac River. 
</P>
<P>
	Banneker was an astronomer, mathematician and farmer in addition  
to being a surveyor. His appointment was proposed by Secretary of 
State Thomas Jefferson after Banneker sent a copy of an almanac he 
edited to Jefferson along with a letter urging abolition of 
slavery. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson sent a copy of the almanac to the Academy of Sciences  
in Paris, where he had served as U.S. ambassador, as evidence of 
the abilities of African Americans. A high school in Washington is 
already named for Banneker.

<HEADLINE> Pepsi Makes Complaint Vs. Coca-Cola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- PepsiCo has acknowledged filing the complaint  
that prompted a European investigation of charges Coca-Cola is 
illegally trying to force competitors out of the market. 
</P>
<P>
	While Pepsi refrained from beating up on its rival during Coke's  
recent contamination scare in Belgium, analysts say the No. 2 
soft-drink maker is trying to gain a competitive edge by 
distracting Coke with regulatory and legal challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Union suspects Coke may have offered rebates to  
retailers to shut out competition in markets the Atlanta-based 
company already dominates. The EU confirmed this week that raids 
were conducted at Coca-Cola offices in four European countries to 
seize documents from the world's largest soft-drink manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
	Pepsi said Friday it first complained to European regulators  
about Coke's business practices last year and formally filed its 
complaint June 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did file a complaint with the commission regarding trade  
practices by the Coca-Cola system,'' Pepsi spokesman Richard 
Detwiler said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why Pepsi filed the complaint, Detwiler said only that  
``we have a very strong interest in fair and lawful competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola on Friday again denied wrongdoing while declining  
comment on Pepsi's action. 
</P>
<P>
	``We definitely believe we're within full compliance of all  
competition laws and regulations,'' said Coke spokesman Ben 
Deutsch. ``We believe that the investigation as it continues will 
prove that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts viewed the complaint as the latest attempt by  
Pepsi to unsettle Coke. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pepsi has done this before and obviously if they can throw  
Coke off stride, distract them or in any way cause them disruption 
competitively, it will be worth it,'' said Martin Romm, an analyst 
for Credit Suisse First Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically this is all competitive posturing on their part,''  
Romm said. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, Coke fell 1.4  
percent, or by 87 1/2 cents, to $61.25 a share, while PepsiCo was off 
43 3/4 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $39.37 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Pepsi refrained from beating up Coke during the June health  
scare in which fears of contamination and complaints of illness by 
hundreds of consumers led Belgium, France, Luxembourg and the 
Netherlands to ban Coca-Cola products for more than a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the bans were lifted, Coke had less than a month to  
breathe before Pepsi's complaint caused investigators this week to 
comb through files at Coke offices in Britain, Austria, Germany and 
Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
	Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner for the European  
Union, has said he suspects Coke had offered retailers rebates for 
expanding sales and for stocking the whole range of Coke beverages. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola officials have denied any wrongdoing.  
</P>
<P>
	If a full-blown investigation of Coke's trade practices in  
Europe is pursued by regulators, it could take a year. Companies 
found guilty of violating EU competition rules could face fines of 
up to 10 percent of their revenue, although fines have been smaller 
in practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the commission fined British Airways more than $7  
million for offering unfair perks to travel agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say Pepsi is trying to increase its market share in  
European countries where its products sell a distant second to 
Coke's. 
</P>
<P>
	In Germany, Denmark and Austria, Coke controls between 43  
percent and 57 percent of the market. Pepsi's share is between 5 
percent and 9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pepsi is really looking to increase their business overseas  
and in Europe,'' said beverage analyst Rick Joy of Standard &AMP; 
Poor's. ``It's not going to be a situation where the market share's 
going to shift overnight. But it might be a situation where they 
gain a little bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It isn't the first time Pepsi has turned to legal and regulatory  
powers to gain leverage against Coke. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, PepsiCo Inc., based in Purchase, N.Y., filed suit in  
federal court in New York accusing Coca-Cola Co. of violating 
antitrust laws by cornering the market for fountain drinks sold 
through U.S. theaters, restaurants and stadiums. The suit is 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke has said Pepsi hurt its own fountain sales because it  
failed to aggressively court chains years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Pepsi was also involved in trying to block Coke's beleaguered  
efforts to buy Cadbury Schweppes brands in Australia and to buy 
Orangina, the most popular soft drink in France, said John Sicher, 
editor and publisher of Beverage Digest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pepsi has stepped up its legal efforts against Coke in a  
number of markets,'' Sicher said. ``What's happening right now (in 
Europe) is not just one isolated circumstance.''

<HEADLINE> Ford Plant in Brazil Still Struck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Union leaders on Friday vowed to stay  
out on strike at the Ford truck plant in Sao Paulo, saying the 
company's promise to guarantee workers their jobs until year-end 
was insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 1,500 workers went on strike Thursday after a newspaper  
reported that the Ford would shut down its Sao Paulo factory and 
transfer production to the northeastern state of Bahia. 
</P>
<P>
	The strike brought the facility in a working-class neighborhood  
of Sao Paulo to a standstill. It normally produces 120 trucks a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford denied it was planning to move the plant to Bahia but  
acknowledged it was studying the possibility of transferring it to 
a less densely populated area in Sao Paulo state. 
</P>
<P>
	After a meeting with Ford's human resources director, Carlos  
Augusto Marino, labor leaders said Thursday that an agreement was 
reached to guarantee jobs for the workers through Dec. 31. That was 
expected to get the workers' back on their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleno Bezerra, secretary general of the Sao Paulo Metalworkers  
Union, said Ford also promised to keep the truck factory in Sao 
Paulo state and would give the union a say as to where it will be 
moved. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Friday, Carlos Abreu Ortiz, director of the Sao Paulo  
metal workers union, said the strike would continue until Ford 
promised to move the workers along with the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortiz said the union planned to stage protests to call attention  
to the workers' plight.

<HEADLINE> National Steel, Union Agree </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- National Steel Corp. and workers represented  
by the United Steelworkers of America have reached a tentative 
agreement on a new contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Details were not immediately released following Thursday's  
announcement because the deal still must be approved by the 
company's board and the union's Basic Steel Industry Conference 
Advisory Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Rank-and-file union members also must approve the five-year  
agreement. The current pact was due to expire at the end of July. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pleased that we were able to reach an agreement,  
thereby avoiding any disruption of our operations,'' Yutaka Tanaka, 
National Steel's chairman and chief executive, said in a written 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Steelworkers President George Becker said the bargaining  
proceeded in much the same way as it did with agreements reached 
earlier this month with U.S. Steel and Bethlehem Steel. 
</P>
<P>
	``As in the earlier agreements, we feel that a great deal of  
progress has been made to restore pattern bargaining to the basic 
steel industry,'' Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Steelworkers union represents 6,900 employees at National  
Steel, based in Mishawaka, Ind. They work at facilities in Indiana, 
Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota, including two integrated steel 
mills, a finishing plant and an iron ore mine. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, the Steelworkers reached tentative agreements with  
U.S. Steel and Bethlehem Steel Corp. that raise wages by $2 an hour 
over five years and boost pensions. Union workers are in the 
process of ratifying that deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The union continues to negotiate with LTV Steel and Ispat  
Inland. The union local at Ispat's East Chicago plant voted this 
week to authorize negotiators to call a strike if talks break down.

<HEADLINE> Washington Post Earnings Up 6 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A 20 percent drop in newsprint costs helped  
The Washington Post Company report second-quarter earnings Friday 
of $67.9 million, or $6.67 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	That represents a 6 percent increase from the same period in  
1998. It also exceeded analysts' expectations, who had expected 
earnings of $6.46 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue for the three months ended June 30 was $557.2 million,  
up from $525.8 million in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues from the company's Cable One cable operations climbed  
17 percent while newspaper operations saw a 2 percent increase. 
</P>
<P>
	That, along with an increase in Washington Post's pension  
credit, helped offset some areas where revenues declined. 
Broadcasting revenue fell 5 percent while the Post's magazine 
division saw a 7 percent slide. 
</P>
<P>
	For the six months ended June 30, the Post earned $113.1  
million, or $11.08 per share, on revenue of $1.08 billion. That 
compared to earnings of $271.7 million, or $26.74 a share, on 
revenue of $1.01 billion in the year-ago period, though that 
included a gain of $162.8 million from the sale of the company's 28 
percent interest in Cowles Media Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post Company publishes several newspapers,  
including its flagship, The Washington Post. Its other holdings 
include Newsweek magazine and 6 television stations. It also owns 
the Kaplan Educational Centers. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of the Washington Post fell $1.25 Friday to close at  
$569.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Crops Dying in Mid-Atlantic Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Malcolm Goode Jr. is so discouraged he can't  
bear to look at his field of dead corn, shriveled from drought. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it is going to turn around this year,'' said  
Goode, 46, who owns 500 acres in Maddox, Md. ``The corn crop is 
just about shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A growing number of farmers who can only stand by and watch  
their crops die because of a drought that began last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The worst conditions are in the mid-Atlantic and the interior  
Pacific Northwest. Drought conditions also exist in the Northeast 
and California. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time a dry spell continued this long in this region was  
November 1979 to April 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, Pennsylvania has declared a drought emergency, which  
means mandatory restrictions on water use. In New Jersey, the 
governor has asked people to cut back. Areas of Virginia have been 
declared agriculture disaster areas. Maryland and Delaware have 
issued drought warnings, asking the public to conserve. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey farmer Bob Puskas said the last good rain was 3  
inches in May. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is very devastating,'' said Puskas, who farms 1,500 acres  
in Somerset. ``Our corn is pretty much a lost cause. Milk 
production is off by one-third. It is from the heat stress and 
there's no pasture left.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reservoirs throughout the region are below normal and dropping.  
In eastern Pennsylvania, some wells are drying up. 
</P>
<P>
	Areas of Maryland and Virginia are running a 15-inch rain  
deficit over the past year, meaning rainfall is about 32 percent 
below normal. In Pennsylvania and New Jersey, some areas have a 
13-inch deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	It would take a tropical storm to pull the region out of the  
drought, but those conditions probably wouldn't come until August 
or September. 
</P>
<P>
	In Maryland, the mayor of Myersville employed dowsers -- people  
who search for water using divining rods -- after the town spent 
$20,000 on a geologist and an engineer who both came up dry. 
Drillers found water Thursday where the dowsers said it would be, 
but a hydro-geologist said the flow was too little for a city. 
</P>
<P>
	In Philadelphia, city fountains have been turned off and  
sprinkler caps were removed from more than 100 fire hydrants used 
by children to keep cool. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven counties in Virginia have asked to be declared disaster  
areas. About 500,000 fish were found dead Thursday in a tributary 
of the Pocomoke River -- apparent victims of excessive heat, which 
can deplete water of oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, many municipalities have placed restrictions on  
watering lawns and filling pools. 
</P>
<P>
	Livestock, hay and pastures have been hit particularly hard.  
</P>
<P>
	``People are culling their herds, they're selling more of their  
livestock, because they see they're not going to have enough water 
or feed to carry their herd into the winter,'' said Roy Seward of 
the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.

<HEADLINE> Part of Charleston's Wall Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Construction workers laboring in the  
city's historic district have found timbers from the wall that 
protected colonial Charleston some 300 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The four hand-hewn, red cedar timbers, each about 9 inches  
square, provide the first solid clues to the location of the city's 
old landward wall, archaeologists said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The timbers were found beneath the brick shell of the Charleston  
County Courthouse, which is being renovated after heavy damage in 
Hurricane Hugo a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's part of the walled city. It's a tangible piece of that  
very early construction, probably some of the oldest archaeological 
artifacts ever recovered'' in the city, said Joe Joseph, an 
archaeologist working with the county on excavations at the site. 
</P>
<P>
	Charleston was founded in 1670 at what is now Charlestowne  
Landing just up the Ashley River. By 1690 settlers had moved to the 
current location on the peninsula between the Ashley and the Cooper 
Rivers. 
</P>
<P>
	There they built a walled city for protection against Indians,  
the Spanish, the French and pirates. Three of the walls faced marsh 
and water, and evidence of bricks from sections of those walls has 
previously been discovered. 
</P>
<P>
	On the landward side were two parallel earthen walls separated  
by a moat. But early maps are unclear about its exact location. 
</P>
<P>
	It is not clear whether the timbers are from the wall itself, a  
drawbridge over the moat or a defensive work over the water, Joseph 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The landward wall, which was about 10 feet high, was gradually  
abandoned starting about 1720.

<HEADLINE> Officials: Countries Face Y2K Risks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- About half of 161 countries examined by the  
State Department are believed to face a medium to high risk of 
experiencing failures in their telecommunications, energy and or 
transportation sectors because of Year 2000 computer glitches. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacqueline L. Williams-Bridgers, the State Department's  
inspector general, said in congressional testimony this week that 
no region in the global community is likely to be spared 
Y2K-related failures. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some countries, these failures could be a mere annoyance,  
such as a malfunctioning credit card terminal, while in others 
there is a clear risk that electricity, telecommunications and 
other key systems will fail, perhaps creating economic havoc and 
social unrest,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As such, the risk of disruption will likely extend to the  
international trade arena, where a breakdown in any part of the 
supply chain would have a serious impact on the U.S. and world 
economies,'' she said, adding that that the U.S. Foreign affairs 
agenda also could be affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams-Bridgers testified before the special Senate committee  
on the year 2000 technology problem. 
</P>
<P>
	On specific countries, she said there is cautious optimism in  
China about Y2K readiness. Chinese officials are most concerned 
about the impact on railroad freight, medical devices and embedded 
chips. ``The Chinese authorities expect some Y2K problems but 
nothing that would put people's lives in danger or cripple the 
economy,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams-Bridgers said Japanese ministries and companies were  
working toward compliance despite news reports to the contrary. 
``The Japanese acknowledge they got off to a late start in 
addressing Y2K and this may hamper their ability to thoroughly 
address the problem before the end of the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Russia, the nuclear sector reported that all safety systems  
are compliant. Plant operations computers may have undiagnosed 
problems that could force a shutdown, she said. She also pointed 
out that excess generating capacity within the electrical grid 
would allow for continued provision of power to high-priority 
customers even in the event all nuclear power plants shut down. 
</P>
<P>
	Visiting U.S. officials found that the banking, electricity ands  
transportation sectors in Malasia were generally in the advanced 
stages of being fixed or replaced, she said. In South Korea, she 
said officials got off to a late start except for banking and 
communications. Taiwanese authorities and large business 
enterprises have made a great deal of progress in addressing Y2K 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	In India, progress has been reported in the last six months,  
especially in the critical sectors of banking and finance, civil 
aviation and telecommunications. ``But nowhere is the Y2K process 
complete, and contingency planning has barely begun,'' 
Williams-Bridgers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other points in her testimony:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Of the 161 countries assessed, two thirds are believed to have  
a low probability of experiencing Y2K-related failures in the 
``water/waste water'' sectors. 
</P>
<P>
	--Industrialized countries were generally found to be at low risk  
of having Y2K-related infrastructure failures, particularly in the 
finance sector. Still nearly a third of these (11 of 39) were 
reported to be at medium risk of failure in the transportation 
sector, and almost one-fourth (9 of 39) were reported to be at a 
medium or high risk of failure in the telecommunications, energy or

	--Anywhere from 52 to 68 developing countries out of 98 were  
assessed as having a medium or high risk in the telecommunication, 
transportation and/or energy sectors. Still, the relatively low 
level of computerization in key sectors of the developing world may 
reduce the risk of prolonged infrastructure failures. Among the 
vulnerable countries are former republics of the Soviet Union and 
former East bloc nations.

<HEADLINE> Panel OKs $568M for U.S. Embassies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House Appropriations Committee is  
proposing to spend $568 million to rebuild and fortify U.S. 
embassies, scaling down a more expensive plan endorsed earlier by 
the House. 
</P>
<P>
	The figure nearly doubles Clinton administration requests but  
falls far short of the $1.4 billion included in a House foreign 
operations bill passed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	House appropriators determine proposed actual spending levels,  
which often differ from figures in other bills. 
</P>
<P>
	The money was part of $5.67 billion the committee approved  
Thursday for the State Department and related agencies next fiscal 
year, a $1.2 billion cut from this year's budget and $506 million 
below President Clinton's request. 
</P>
<P>
	The spending bill still must be approved by the full House, and  
final figures will be worked out in negotiations between the House 
and the Senate. The Senate approved the administration request of 
$300 million for embassy security. 
</P>
<P>
	The action came as a telephoned bomb threat forced the  
evacuation of the U.S. Embassy in Chad. A two-hour search of the 
building uncovered nothing, and the embassy was scheduled to reopen 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the latest in a series of temporary embassy closures as  
the Aug. 7 first anniversary of twin bombings of U.S. embassies in 
Africa approaches. The U.S. Embassy in Mozambique remained closed 
for a fourth day Thursday.

<HEADLINE> TV Looks For One Right Answer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If there's one thing we feel certain about, it's  
that each of us should strive to be certain about everything. After 
all, information breeds clarity, doesn't it? And in the information 
age, answers are ours for the taking. Just do it! Doubt is for 
wimps. 
</P>
<P>
	Our craving for certainty is a hunger that TV shares (doubt is  
difficult to illustrate and TV is a visual medium). TV stirs that 
appetite within us. 
</P>
<P>
	Of this we have been sadly reminded by the nonstop TV coverage  
of the death of John Kennedy Jr., his wife and sister-in-law. A 
plane crashed, people died and their bodies were recovered. Their 
ashes were carried by the wind to the sea. But beyond that and the 
gruesome details, we needed, and still need, to satisfy the larger 
whys. 
</P>
<P>
	So this past week we viewers looked to on-air commentators who  
might identify some cosmic reason, some unified theory to explain 
these familiar mysteries. 
</P>
<P>
	Set aside for a moment even more daunting issues of life and  
death. What about the question, ``Are the Kennedys cursed as a 
family, or aren't they? Yes or no?'' If TV people dwell on it 
persistently enough, the answer will emerge. 
</P>
<P>
	Or so we insist.  
</P>
<P>
	But our faith in the elucidating powers of TV isn't limited to  
the news it covers. 
</P>
<P>
	When we watch most comedies and dramas, we take part in a TV  
tit-for-tat: By sticking around until the final commercial, we are 
rewarded with whodunit or a fitting moral or the sight of a 
reassuring hug. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks in no small part to TV entertainment, ``closure'' is a  
buzzword of our time. 
</P>
<P>
	But sometimes TV throws us a curve.  
</P>
<P>
	On rare occasions, people on TV flat-out confess they don't know  
the answer to the riddle. Sometimes a TV show doesn't tie things up 
by the final fadeout. Sometimes even the most rudimentary closure 
is denied us. 
</P>
<P>
	During a recent seminar at Manhattan's Museum of Television &AMP;  
Radio, producer-writer Edward Zwick disclosed the most inflammatory 
issue in his TV dramas. It isn't drugs, sex or violence, said the 
co-creator of ``thirtysomething.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Zwick declared, the hot-button issue ``for which we've  
received as much vitriol as any conversation about abortion,'' is 
ambivalence. 
</P>
<P>
	The man and woman of Zwick's upcoming ABC drama, ``Once and  
Again,'' are divorced parents each trying to reconcile feelings of 
desire, guilt, fear, responsibility -- and beginning to suspect that 
no quick fix is forthcoming. Ambivalence? Conceding that an answer 
is beyond your grasp? 
</P>
<P>
	``I actually think that that's one of the last great taboo  
subjects,'' Zwick said. ``I think people, many people, are 
terrified of the inner conflict.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For many of us, the inner conflict raged in the aftermath (and  
coverage) of the Columbine High School shootings. The only question 
anyone could phrase was, ``Why?'' But the available ``becauses'' 
were maddeningly varied and often at odds. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of us shared a yearning to make those deaths in Colorado  
emblematic of something meaningful, to find in them a lesson to 
apply to our own lives. 
</P>
<P>
	How can we prevent that tragedy in our community, within our  
family, we asked ourselves? But no remedy -- better schools, better 
parents, better laws, better music -- seemed likely to find 
consensus. Not in the country. Not even, perhaps, within each of 
us. And we were left as haunted by this lack of resolution as we 
were by the tragedy itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, we discounted, or tried to dismiss our jumble of  
thoughts and feelings that were likely to serve us in no clear-cut 
way, yet still demanded recognition. 
</P>
<P>
	``The test of a first-rate intelligence,'' wrote F. Scott  
Fitzgerald, ``is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind 
at the same time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But TV overwhelmingly prefers a different style: survival of the  
fittest. It's one side waging battle with another, as if there were 
a single correct answer that, bellowed loud enough, will emerge as 
the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Just recall a couple of the news-talk programs' titles. On CNBC  
there's ``Hardball'' (strike out the opposition!). On CNN there's 
``Crossfire'' (blow the enemy away before he pulls the trigger!). 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe it's time someone confronted the final taboo by launching  
The Ambivalence Channel. It would be a place where more than one 
answer goes into a solution. Where saying, ``I don't know,'' 
wouldn't translate as failure. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Juror Found Guilty of Taking Bribe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A one-time jury foreman was convicted Friday of  
accepting nearly $500,000 in bribes from two reputed drug kingpins 
for his vote to acquit them. 
</P>
<P>
	Miguel Moya was on the jury that acquitted Augusto ``Willie''  
Falcon and Salvador Magluta in 1996 of charges they smuggled 75 
tons of cocaine from Colombia and made $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Falcon and Magluta were reputedly the top drug traffickers in  
the United States in the 1980s, and the case was an embarassing 
defeat for federal prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	After deliberating less than four hours, a jury convicted Moya  
of money laundering, witness tampering conspiracy, bribery, 
obstruction of justice and filing a false tax return. The charges 
carry penalties totaling 138 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer Thomas Sclafani said he planned to appeal the  
verdict. Moya is scheduled to sentenced Oct. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the second trial for Moya. His first ended in a  
mistrial in February after jurors deliberated for five days without 
reaching a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Moya accepted money for his vote and for  
persuading the panel to acquit Falcon and Magluta. Not long after 
the acquittal, Moya's parents retired and began living in luxury, 
buying a home in the Florida Keys, a two-week vacation in Hawaii, 
season tickets to the Florida Marlins, several Rolex watches, a 
sports car and a boat. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for the Moya family said the money came from cousin  
Ramon ``Ray'' Perez, a convicted drug smuggler and former Miami 
policeman. He testified he gave his relatives $485,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Moya's father, Jose, pleaded guilty to witness tampering and  
will be sentenced Sept. 24. Moya's mother, Rafaela, pleaded guilty 
to making a false statement to the FBI and was sentenced to one 
year probation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcon-Magluta jurors had deliberated for three days when  
they sent a note to the judge saying they were locked in a 
``personal conflict'' and ``could not reach a verdict.'' Hours 
later, they returned the acquittals. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men are now imprisoned on lesser, unrelated charges.

<HEADLINE> First Kosovo Refugees To Leave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- About 300 Kosovo refugees will be leaving the  
United States for Yugoslavia on Monday, the first to return to 
their homeland from America since the NATO bombing campaign ended. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethnic Albanians will be flown out of New York and taken to  
Macedonia. A civilian convoy will then take the group to Pristina, 
in Kosovo, said Lauren Engle, spokeswoman for the International 
Organization for Migration. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 9,700 refugees came to the United States beginning in May.  
About half went to live with relatives, and most of the others were 
relocated across the nation under the sponsorship of religious and 
social service organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-nine countries that took in refugees from Kosovo agreed  
to coordinate the return of those who want to go back, and many aid 
agencies were confident they could have them home before winter 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost of returning a refugee home from America is estimated  
at $500. Overall, the United States budgeted $400 million to take 
care of ethnic Albanians who were driven here by violence in 
Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Hints at Future Rate Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even after 12 years in the job, Federal  
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is proving once again that he 
hasn't lost the ability to surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's top moneyman, in a midyear report to Congress  
Thursday on the state of the economy, delivered what some 
economists viewed as a stern message and a possible signal that the 
Fed is likely to raise interest rates again before the year is out. 
</P>
<P>
	While Greenspan declared that the U.S. economy is enjoying an  
``exceptional year'' with almost 1.25 million jobs being created 
and no increase yet in consumer prices, he also pledged to move 
``promptly and forcefully'' to raise interest rates should 
inflation flare up. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is imperative that we do not become complacent,'' Greenspan  
told the House Banking Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Some economists -- surprised by what they described as a hawkish  
anti-inflation tone struck by Greenspan -- believed his comments 
increased the odds that the central bank would move to raise rates 
again this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Greenspan is saying there's not a question of if there  
will be another tightening, but a question of how much more,'' said 
Tim O'Neill, chief economist for the Bank of Montreal and Harris 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts said they were looking for the Fed to follow with  
one or two more rate hikes, beginning in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Greenspan defended the Fed's decision to raise interest  
rates a quarter of a point on June 30, its first hike in two years, 
he indicated that may not be enough to hold inflation in check. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed, he said, ``did not believe that its recent modest  
tightening would put the risks of inflation going forward 
completely into balance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street, which had been hitting new highs in recent weeks on  
the belief the Fed would be slow to boost rates further, tumbled on 
Greenspan's remarks, with bond prices and stock prices both lower. 
At one point, the Dow dipped more than 100 points from Wednesday's 
close. It closed down 33.56 points Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets reacted that way because Greenspan's ``remarks  
were, in fact, tougher'' than the markets expected, said First 
Union's chief economist David Orr. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan noted a number of concerns about inflation coming from  
tight labor markets. He also cautioned that investors had become 
too confident that recent strong gains in productivity would 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
	If productivity does not continue rising at its recent pace and  
if red-hot consumer demand does not moderate, he said, then ``the 
economy could overheat. That would engender inflationary pressures 
and put the sustainability of this unprecedented period of 
remarkable growth in jeopardy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of this threat, Greenspan said, ``the Federal Reserve  
will have to act promptly and forcefully so as to preclude 
imbalances from arising that would only require more disruptive 
adjustments later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo, viewed  
Greenspan's testimony ``as a stern lecture to the stock market. He 
gave the market a cold shower to try to cool it down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street rallied after the Fed's June 30 rate hike. But they  
were mainly reacting to the Fed's decision, announced at the same 
time, to move its policy directive -- an indication of future action 
-- from one leaning toward raising rates back to neutral, economists 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems Greenspan wasn't happy with the financial markets'  
favorable response to his shift to a neutral policy stance in 
June,'' said David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Given that, some economists viewed Greenspan's remarks as  
increasing the likelihood that the Fed would switch its policy 
directive to one favoring a rate increase at its August meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, who first worried about ``irrational exuberance'' in  
the stock market in December 1996, raised those concerns anew 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent record highs in stock prices could be indicating the  
presence of an ``asset bubble,'' meaning when prices burst and fall 
back to more realistic levels, investors could face painful losses, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the job of economic policymakers to mitigate the fallout  
... and hopefully ease the transition to the next expansion,'' 
Greenspan said.

<HEADLINE> Slim Evidence Against SLA Fugitive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A 23-year-old grand jury transcript released  
Friday shows that the most damaging testimony against former 
Symbionese Liberation Army fugitive Kathleen Soliah came from two 
witnesses who have since died. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Soliah, now a 52-year-old doctor's wife and Minnesota mother  
of three, has pleaded innocent to charges that she conspired to 
kill Los Angeles police officers with nail bombs placed under their 
patrol cars in 1975. Neither bomb went off. 
</P>
<P>
	She has admitted fleeing two decades ago after her indictment by  
a federal grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	During those proceedings, plumbing company employee James  
Marshall identified Ms. Soliah from a photograph as the woman who 
accompanied a man who bought materials linked to the pipe bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	A bomb expert, Arleigh McCree, said he thought the bombs could  
have been made in an apartment in San Francisco where Ms. Soliah's 
fingerprints were found. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men are dead, and the transcript showed no other eyewitness  
identifications of Ms. Soliah. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Michael Latin has acknowledged the circumstantial  
nature of the case but has said there is sufficient evidence to 
bring her to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Soliah's lawyer, Stuart Hanlon, noted that the FBI and  
police department experts were unable to match prints on the bombs 
to any SLA members. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the fingerprints on the bomb can't be matched to anybody,  
wouldn't that make you think they have the wrong group of people?'' 
Hanlon said in a phone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless further evidence is uncovered, the case should be  
dismissed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Soliah was freed Tuesday on $1 million bail after spending  
five weeks in jail following her arrest in Minnesota, where she was 
living as Sara Jane Olson. She was on her way back to her St. Paul 
home Friday after meetings with her lawyers in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The 236-page grand jury transcript records the testimony of 27  
witnesses, most of them law enforcement officers, who told how the 
pipe bombs were discovered under police cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Police claimed that the bombs were intended as retaliation for  
the 1974 SLA shootout in which Los Angeles police officers killed 
six members of the radical underground group. 
</P>
<P>
	A former San Francisco policeman and freelance photographer,  
Alexander Jason, told of hearing Ms. Soliah speak at a Berkeley 
rally shortly after the shootout, and identified her from a photo. 
</P>
<P>
	He testified that he heard her speak of the death of her friend  
Angela Atwood, who was killed in the shootout, and express support 
for William and Emily Harris and Patricia Hearst, known as Tania, 
who were then wanted by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember her saying, 'Tania, Emily, and Bill ... you have  
made your message clear. Keep fighting,''' Jason testified. ``She 
said, ' Keep fighting. We are with you. I am with you.''' 
</P>
<P>
	In a San Francisco apartment rented by the Harrises, agents said  
they found a closet full of bombmaking materials and weapons. Also 
in the closet were a manual on how to operate Browning Hi-Power 
pistols and an Army technical manual. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Soliah's prints were found on the Browning manual and on  
walls of the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts said they matched eight sets of fingerprints to the  
technical manual, including those of Hearst, the Harrises, Ms. 
Soliah's brother, Steven, and other members of the SLA. 
</P>
<P>
	While many experts testified they could not definitely link the  
bombmaking materials from San Francisco with the bombs in Los 
Angeles, McCree made a positive connection by examining the police 
car bombs and a device found in the closet of the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Due to the unique nature of the materials found in that closet  
... some individual who had access to those materials did build 
these three bombs,'' McCree testified.

<HEADLINE> Bush Spends Weekend With N.Y. Gov. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush and New York  
Gov. George E. Pataki, mentioned as possible Republican 
presidential ticketmates next year, are spending the weekend 
together. 
</P>
<P>
	The two were heading for Cooperstown today for the Baseball Hall  
of Fame induction ceremonies and to raise some money for Bush's 
presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki, who briefly toyed with a possible presidential race of  
his own earlier this year, has since endorsed Bush's candidacy and 
is considered a possible vice presidential running mate for the 
Texas governor. The two are graduates of Yale University, where 
Pataki was a year ahead of Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those being inducted this weekend into the Hall of Fame is  
former Texas Ranger pitcher Nolan Ryan. Bush is a former co-owner 
of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	This evening, Bush and Pataki were attending a $1,000-a-person  
fund-raising reception for the Texas governor being held at the 
Cooperstown estate of railroad magnate Walter Rich. About 100 
guests were expected to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the fund-raiser, Bush spokeswoman Mindy Ticker said the  
Texas governor planned to keep the focus of his weekend on baseball 
and Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Pataki said Friday that while he expected he and Bush  
would talk politics, ``I'm more concerned about using my friendship 
with Governor Bush to meet Nolan Ryan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two governors planned to stay overnight at the Cooperstown  
home of Jane Forbe Clark, a major GOP contributor. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Pataki officially opens the induction ceremonies.  
Later in the day, Bush heads for Maine to spend a few days at his 
parents' summer home in Kennebunkport.

<HEADLINE> Kennedy Memorial Held in New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- At the stately 126-year-old church where  
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis often found solace, friends and 
relatives remembered her son John Fitzgerald Kennedy Jr. and his 
wife today at a private Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	An invitation-only group of about 350 people, including  
President Clinton and his family, streamed into the Church of St. 
Thomas More in Manhattan for the 1 1/2 hour service. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Richard Freeman and his wife, Ann, the stepfather and mother  
of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and Lauren Bessette, were among the 
first to arrive, walking quietly into the church about 90 minutes 
before the 11 a.m. memorial. Kennedy's sister, Caroline, and uncle, 
Sen. Edward Kennedy, arrived later. 
</P>
<P>
	The Massachusetts senator, who became a father figure to his  
nephew, had the job of eulogizing JFK Jr., one insider said, 
speaking on condition on anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Other mourners included JFK Jr. hero Muhammad Ali, hip-hop  
artist Wyclef Jean, cousins Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Maria 
Shriver, her husband, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and former U.S. Sen. 
Alan Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
	After the service, the congregation was invited to walk two  
blocks uptown to the landmark School of the Sacred Heart for a 
reception. Caroline Kennedy once attended the independent girls 
school, which was founded in 1881. 
</P>
<P>
	As Secret Service agents carried two vases with white flowers  
and a white wreath into the church, ordinary people filled 
sidewalks outside. Some arrived as early as 4 a.m. for the chance 
to be with the family in spirit. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathleen Sheehan, 51, who attended Robert F. Kennedy's 1968  
funeral in St. Patrick's Cathedral, came from Philadelphia with her 
24-year-old daughter, Heather. Although stuck behind a police 
barricade with the church out of view, they were happy about their 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not here to gawk,'' Heather Sheehan said. ``We're just  
here to show the Kennedy family our support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The privacy of today's Mass -- and of the service aboard a Navy  
destroyer when the ashes of Kennedy, his wife and sister-in-law 
were committed to the sea -- contrasted with the public Mass held 
Thursday by New York's Irish community. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands gathered at Old St. Patrick's Cathedral in Little  
Italy, once the city's main Roman Catholic shrine. 
</P>
<P>
	They honored the Bessette sisters and Kennedy, who inherited his  
father's sense of promise, his mother's glamour and his family's 
tragic legacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``He never asked what we could do for him, but rather what he  
could do for us,'' Carolyn Ryan told the thousand mourners at the 
service marked by bagpipe music, hymns and Scripture read in 
Gaelic. Some 3,000 more people were outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan, of the Emerald Isle Immigration Center, asked congregants  
to salute Kennedy in memory of his famous gesture to his slain 
father, the nation's 35th president, on JFK. Jr.'s third birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies of Kennedy, his wife and his sister-in-law were  
recovered Wednesday in the waters off Martha's Vineyard, Mass. 
Authorities said the three were killed on impact when the 
single-engine plane piloted by Kennedy spiraled into the sea a week 
ago today. 
</P>
<P>
	JFK Jr. was 38; his wife of nearly three years was 33. Ms.  
Bessette, who was 34, was to be remembered at a separate, private 
service Saturday at an Episcopal church in her family's hometown of 
Greenwich, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	The service aboard the Navy destroyer USS Briscoe was led by Ms.  
Kennedy and Mrs. Freeman. The senator and cousins William Kennedy 
Smith and Maria Shriver also attended. 
</P>
<P>
	About 15 mourners, some wearing black and flanked by sailors in  
dress whites, gathered on the stern of the destroyer. A Navy honor 
guard fired a rifle volley for the three victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very simple, but very solemn,'' said the Rev. Louis  
Iasiello, a Navy chaplain who assisted the Rev. Charles O'Byrne in 
the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Byrne presided at Kennedy's wedding and was presiding over  
today's Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	The Church of St. Thomas More has become an impromptu shrine,  
much like Kennedy's apartment in the Tribeca neighborhood and the 
Boston library named for his father. Bouquets, cards and stuffed 
animals that were left outside the church were cleared away by the 
Secret Service. The Secret Service also ordered residents to keep 
away from windows overlooking the church. 
</P>
<P>
	While the family mourns, admirers across the country are  
expressing their sorrow in services arranged for disheartened 
congregations. 
</P>
<P>
	``People want to be with others at a time like this, people want  
to have some sense of healing, and for most of us, you can't do 
that privately,'' said the Rev. Keith Fennessy, who celebrated the 
Mass at Old St. Patrick's. ``We need other people.''

<HEADLINE> Mondini Wins Tour de France Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POITIERS, France (AP) -- Lance Armstrong moved another stage  
closer to victory in the Tour de France today, staying safely back 
in the pack but not losing a second of his commanding lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texan finished 31st in the 18th stage, which was won by  
Italy's Gianpaolo Mondini, and holds an overall lead of 6 minutes, 
15 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, who has made an inspirational ride in his return from  
testicular cancer, next faces a time trial, his specialty, on 
Saturday. Then comes Sunday's final stage in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	Mondini denied France a chance to win its first stage of the  
Tour. Frenchman Jean-Cyril Robin came close with a second-place 
finish, and Alexandre Vinokourov of Kazakstan was third. 
</P>
<P>
	The 117-mile stage began in Jonzac and finished in Futuroscope,  
a futuristic science fiction park in central France. The riders 
went from Bordeaux's wine country to cognac country, where vineyard 
workers staged a brief protest at the beginning of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Armstrong followed a similar strategy in the 17th  
stage, staying safely in the pack. After the exhausting mountain 
climbs in the Pyrenees, the 120-mile trip past pine forests and 
vineyards near Bordeaux looked positively relaxing. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong finished 51st and lost none of his lead that day as  
well. Along the way, the link between Lance Armstrong and Neil 
Armstrong did not go unnoticed. ``Go Lance -- Reach the Moon!'' read 
a banner along the route, accompanied by an American flag. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong declined to speak at the postrace news conference  
Thursday, a day after lashing out at the French media for what he 
called ``vulture journalism,'' 
</P>
<P>
	He smiled Wednesday when reminded by a TV interviewer of the  
link with Neil Armstrong -- but otherwise expressed only anger and 
frustration with the continued drug accusations. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want me to crack on the bike -- and I'm not going to,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	For two days, the French newspaper Le Monde reported that traces  
of a corticosteroid were detected in his urine. 
</P>
<P>
	Corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory and painkilling drugs that  
are not listed as steroids. They are banned unless prescribed by 
doctors for a variety of conditions, including asthma. 
</P>
<P>
	Cycling's governing body said the only drug Armstrong had been  
taking was an authorized skin cream for saddle sores. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't a story about doping, it's a story about skin  
cream,'' Armstrong said.

<HEADLINE> Crowds Say Farewell to JFK Jr. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- People wept to the lyrics of ``Danny Boy'' at  
Old St. Patrick's Cathedral on Thursday as hundreds of mourners bid 
goodbye to John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife, and her sister. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our generation's most shining light has been extinguished too  
soon, and we all feel it very deeply,'' said Rodney Cook, an 
Atlanta architect who counted JFK Jr. and wife Carolyn Bessette 
Kennedy as friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``John would not want us to be saddened over his leaving us,  
rather he would want you to be the hope for our generation ... the 
way he was for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,000 people filled the church in Little Italy, a  
neighborhood not far from where JFK Jr. and his wife lived and once 
home to the city's Irish community. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 3,000 people stood behind police barricades during the  
Catholic memorial Mass. Bagpipe music played as white-robed clergy 
walked to the altar and mourners sang hymns and listened to 
scripture read in Gaelic and the singing of the Irish classic 
``Danny Boy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bouquets of flowers lay in front of the church, the less ornate  
predecessor to the mammoth St. Patrick's Cathedral on Fifth Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy's uncle, Sargent Shriver, was among the mourners, and he  
gave voice to something that has been on the collective conscience 
for days: the family has suffered tragedy far too often. 
</P>
<P>
	``One can never be absolutely prepared,'' Shriver said. ``But  
the Kennedys have always shown great courage and bravery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Kennedy's family prepared for a private memorial at an  
uptown church Friday, the public memorial service, organized by 
members of the city's Irish community, gave everyday people a 
chance to say goodbye. 
</P>
<P>
	``I needed to be here,'' said Rosemarie DiCarlo, 38, of upstate  
Cortlandt Manor. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she'd been overcome with emotion since Kennedy's plane  
crashed into the waters of Martha's Vineyard, in Massachusetts, 
killing JFK Jr., 38; his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33; and 
her sister, Lauren Bessette, 34. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many who have been mourning this week for a man they never  
knew, Ms. DiCarlo said she'd been charmed by Kennedy's lack of 
pretension and the ease with which he carried his celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
	``He epitomizes all that New Yorkers are,'' DiCarlo said. ``As  
much fame as he had, he was just one of us, a normal, regular 
guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The clergy touched on the family's sad history.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've never known a family that has suffered so much of the  
pain of loss,'' said the Rev. Colm Campbell, who delivered the 
homily. ``They have the great gift of being there for each other in 
good times and bad. They should know they also have an extended 
family in the Irish community and in New York City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The victims' families released their ashes into the sea off  
Martha's Vineyard on Thursday. A private memorial Mass was planned 
Friday at the Church of St. Thomas More on Manhattan's Upper East 
Side, and a memorial for Ms. Bessette was to be held Saturday in 
Greenwich, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong feeling for Kennedy was evident even in places he  
never lived. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people felt as though they touched the family,  
however distantly,'' said Margot Moran, a Catholic church staffer 
planning a memorial service Monday at Saint Michael's Cathedral in 
Springfield, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tuskegee, Ala., several dozen people joined in a lakeside  
memorial service for Kennedy, Ms. Kennedy and Ms. Bessette. It was 
arranged by Rep. Johnny Ford, a former Robert F. Kennedy aide who 
said he was mindful of the significance of water for the Kennedy 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	In Ventura, Calif., the Joseph P. Reardon Funeral Home set out  
register books in the mortuary for people to sign. The mortuary did 
the same in 1997 after the death of Princess Diana. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Keith Fennessy, who celebrated the Mass at Old St.  
Patrick's, said he hoped the service would provide a public outlet 
for the sadness many have felt since Kennedy's plane spiraled into 
the sea. 
</P>
<P>
	``People want to be with others at a time like this, people want  
to have some sense of healing, and for most of us, you can't do 
that privately. We need other people,'' Fennessy said.

<HEADLINE> Luger Is Banned After Drugs Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE PLACID, N.Y. (AP) -- An American luger was banned from  
competing for two years Friday because he tested positive for a 
drug banned by the International Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Christian Niccum was suspended by the United States Luge  
Association's executive board. The USLA's refused to say which drug 
was involved other than to say it was performance-enhancing. 
</P>
<P>
	Niccum, of Woodinville, Wash., was tested along with teammates  
after the National Championships in Utah on Feb. 21. The positive 
results, available in March, were double-checked and in April the 
USLA was sure that Niccum had used the drug. The USLA tests 
competitors twice a year. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time in the USLA's 20-year history that an  
athlete tested positive for an banned substance and was 
subsequently banned from the sport, said association spokesman 
Sandy Caligiore. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't want to rush through this the first time,''  
Caligiore said, explaining why it took the USLA three months to ban 
Niccum. 
</P>
<P>
	Niccum refused the USLA's offer of a conditional re-instatement  
which required him to perform 100 hours of community service, 
undergo random drug tests, and seek professional help.

<HEADLINE> Chronology of Coke's Troubles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Coca-Cola has been battered by a spate of bad news this past  
year. The litany has taken a toll on sales, profits and Coke's 
stock price -- down 28 percent from an all-time high of nearly $88 a 
share in July 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	A look at Coke's recent troubles.  

</P>
<P>
	April 22, 1999 -- Racial discrimination lawsuit alleges Coca-Cola  
pays black employees less, offers them fewer promotions and gives 
them lower performance evaluation scores than whites. 

</P>
<P>
	May 12, 1999 -- France seeks new review of Coca-Cola revised  
offer to purchase Orangina, France's most popular soft drink. The 
government had earlier rejected the purchase, citing competition 
concerns. The deal is still pending. 

</P>
<P>
	June 9, 1999 -- Australian regulators deny a revised plan by Coke  
to buy Cadbury Schweppes brands because it would lessen market 
competition. The deal was originally part of a $1.85 billion plan 
to buy Cadbury Schweppes brands outside the U.S. but regulatory 
obstacles -- mostly in Europe -- caused Coke to scale back the deal 
to about $1.1 billion. 

</P>
<P>
	June 14, 1999 -- Citing schoolchildren who complained they fell  
sick from drinking Coke, Belgium bans sales of many Coca Cola 
products. France, Luxembourg and the Netherlands imposed their own 
bans a day later. 

</P>
<P>
	June 23, 1999 -- Belgium lifts ban on Coke soft drinks. Coke  
agrees to tighter quality controls. All other countries follow 
suit. 

</P>
<P>
	July 8, 1999 -- Polish authorities say Coca -Cola can resume  
production at a plant shut down the previous week when bacteria was 
found in plastic bottles of mineral water. 

</P>
<P>
	July 15, 1999 -- Judge denies Coke motion to bar class-action  
status for racial discrimination suit. Coca-Cola says quarterly 
earnings drop 21 percent due to declining sales. 

</P>
<P>
	July 22, 1999 -- European Union confirms raids of Coke offices in  
four European nations on suspicion the company abused its dominant 
position by offering retailers unfair incentives to shut out 
competitors.

<HEADLINE> Lack of Oxygen Kills 1 Million Fish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Nearly 1 million small fish died in a tributary  
of the Pocomoke River near the Virginia-Maryland line after 
becoming trapped in the creek and depleting it of oxygen, state 
wildlife officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The menhaden fish, found Thursday in Bullbeggar Creek, were  
feared to be casualties of Pfiesteria piscicida, a toxic microbe 
that in 1997 killed up to 50,000 fish in the Pocomoke and sickened 
at least 20 people. The microbe has killed thousands more fish in 
North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	``The indications are large pools of menhaden swam up this  
creek, got trapped up in there and oxygen levels fell and they 
died,'' said John Surrick, spokesman for the Maryland Department of 
Natural Resources. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfiesteria tears the flesh of fish and causes them to swim in  
circles and upside down. No fish found Thursday had such lesions. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests of creek water samples could be available next week,  
Surrick said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dissolved oxygen levels in water generally decrease in summer  
because of heat, nutrient enrichment from farm and lawn runoff and 
high bacterial counts. 
</P>
<P>
	The massive deaths of the menhaden, which grow up to two inches,  
was the largest fish kill in a decade in Maryland, Natural 
Resources officials said.

<HEADLINE> Ted Kennedy Serves as Family Rock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- After tragedy claimed the lives of all three of  
his brothers, Ted Kennedy became, at just 36, the patriarch of the 
Kennedy family and the one to hold them together in times of grief. 
</P>
<P>
	He was thrust into that role once more this week, after his  
nephew John F. Kennedy Jr. died in a plane crash along with his 
wife and sister-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	The 67-year-old Massachusetts senator, who had been especially  
close to JFK Jr., insisted on being on the Navy salvage ship when 
the bodies were retrieved from the ocean floor. And on Friday, 
Kennedy delivered the main eulogy for his nephew. His family's 
history of loss was a major theme. 
</P>
<P>
	``We dared to think ... that this John Kennedy would live to  
comb gray hair, with his beloved Carolyn by his side,'' Kennedy 
told mourners at a Mass in New York. ``But like his father, he had 
every gift but length of years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teddy, as the family calls him, has had many detractors since  
his own tragedy at Chappaquiddick. But he has proved his strength 
in family crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	He is the sole surviving son of Joseph and Rose's four boys --  
brothers John and Robert were assassinated, and Joseph Jr. was 
killed on a World War II bombing mission. His sister Kathleen died 
in 1948 in a plane wreck. His sister Rosemary is retarded and is in 
an institution. Three other sisters are living: Eunice Kennedy 
Shriver, founder of the Special Olympics; Jean Kennedy Smith, 
former ambassador to Ireland, and Patricia Kennedy Lawford. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, Ted had no interest in politics. He wanted to be a  
newspaper publisher, but his father told him he had to run in 1962 
for the Senate seat that JFK vacated to become president. 
</P>
<P>
	When President Kennedy was killed in 1963, Robert met the coffin  
at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington to accompany it to a 
hospital for autopsy. When Robert was shot in Los Angeles in 1968, 
it was Ted who accompanied the casket to New York. 
</P>
<P>
	From then on, Ted took on the role of family patriarch, in part  
because his father had been incapacitated by a stroke. When Joseph 
Kennedy died the next year, Ted stayed alongside the casket in a 
sleeping bag at the family compound until the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	Ted's new role as family anchor was marked by a powerful eulogy  
for Robert that has been replayed often: 
</P>
<P>
	``He should be remembered simply as a good and decent man, who  
saw wrong and tried to right it, saw suffering and tried to heal 
it, saw war and tried to stop it. As he said many times, `Some men 
see things as they are and say, ``Why?'' I dream things that never 
were and say, ``Why not?''''' 
</P>
<P>
	Ted would later deliver the eulogies for Jacqueline Kennedy  
Onassis in 1994; for his mother, Rose, in 1995; and for his nephew 
on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't let go,'' Ted said after Robert's death, according to  
``The Kennedys: An American Drama,'' by Peter Collier and David 
Horowitz. ``If I let go, Ethel (RFK's widow) will let go, and my 
mother will let go, and all my sisters will let go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He became a surrogate father to Robert's 11 and JFK's two  
children, taking them on trips, giving them internships, even 
partying with them. Douglas, one of Robert's sons, asked Ted to be 
best man at his wedding. 
</P>
<P>
	On the day Ted's niece Kathleen, Robert's oldest child, got  
married in 1973, Ted Kennedy Jr. was scheduled to have his 
cancerous right leg amputated. Kathleen wanted the senator to walk 
her down the aisle, and she offered to postpone the wedding. The 
senator said absolutely not. 
</P>
<P>
	He stayed at the hospital until his son, then 13, was in the  
recovery room, then took a car six blocks to the church to give 
Kathleen away. After the ceremony, he returned to the hospital, 
forsaking the wedding reception. 
</P>
<P>
	There would be still more tragedies to lead the family through --  
the deaths of three nephews: David, RFK's son, of a drug overdose 
in 1984; Michael, RFK's sixth child, in a skiing accident in 1997; 
and now JFK Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Always in the background was his own crisis: Chappaquiddick.  
</P>
<P>
	On July 18, 1969 -- nearly 30 years to the day before JFK Jr.'s  
plane went down not far from there off the Martha's Vineyard coast 
-- the senator drove off a bridge into a pond. His passenger, Mary 
Jo Kopechne, drowned. 
</P>
<P>
	The episode raised questions about the senator's character that  
destroyed any hope he had of becoming president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Ted now has the responsibility of all the Kennedy  
children,'' said Grace Silvio, 62, who watched the family depart 
Thursday for JFK Jr.'s burial at sea. ``It makes me feel sad for 
him. I think he's seen so much.''

<HEADLINE> Indians Recall Infielder Branyan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Russell Branyan, promoted from the minors  
earlier in the day to provide extra pop for the slumping Cleveland 
Indians, hit a two-run homer off David Cone in his first at-bat 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Branyan connected for his first major league hit, sending a  
drive far over the right-field fence at Yankee Stadium. Cone was 
making his first start since pitching a perfect game last Sunday 
against Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	Branyan leads the International League with 29 home runs,  
including three Thursday night for Triple-A Buffalo in a 9-8 win 
over Indianapolis. The third baseman recently was picked as the MVP 
of the IL's All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
	The AL Central-leading Indians, who have lost six of eight since  
the All-Star break, recalled Branyan from Buffalo and optioned 
infielder John McDonald to the minor league club. 
</P>
<P>
	Branyan was batting .220 with 63 RBIs at Triple-A, striking out  
165 times in 92 games. The 23-year-old slugger went 0-for-4 in one 
game for Cleveland last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians entered their series with the AL East-leading  
Yankees having lost six of seven overall. Injuries have been a 
problem all year, and the loss of third baseman Travis Fryman to a 
torn ligament on July 3 has been among the worst. 
</P>
<P>
	Fryman isn't expected back until mid-September and the Indians  
are reportedly shopping for a third baseman. Among the rumored 
names are Gary Gaetti and Carlos Baerga, a former second baseman 
traded by the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	Enrique Wilson has filled in at third, but he hasn't provided  
the same kind of offense Fryman can. Wilson has just one homer and 
17 RBIs.

	The fuel system recall is for 172,154 of the model 626 sedans  
and MX-6 sport coupes sold between 1995 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The models were produced with a fuel filler pipe assembly that  
improperly seals the evaporative emissions system. Owners can take 
their cars to an authorized dealer to be fitted with a sealing gas 
cap for free. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the problem is not a safety hazard, motorists who fail  
to correct it might be unable to renew their vehicle registrations 
in some states because of pollution control requirements, said 
Brian Betz, a spokesman for Mazda North American Operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The minivan recall involves repairs to a latch on the sliding  
doors. Mazda durability testing found that dust can build up on the 
locking mechanism, preventing it from engaging when the child 
safety lock is on. 
</P>
<P>
	The door could open unexpectedly during driving, although no  
reports of accidents or injuries have been reported. Owners should 
not use the child safety locks until repairs are made, Mazda said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 238 of the minivans have been sold and their owners will be  
notified by telephone, Betz said.

<HEADLINE> Senate Won't Block Tobacco Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Reversing course, the Senate has scuttled a  
behind-the-scenes effort to prevent the Justice Department from 
suing the tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
	After the states won billions of dollars through similar tobacco  
suits, President Clinton announced in his State of the Union speech 
that Justice would explore a lawsuit of its own. 
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyers are now studying legal strategy for  
recovering billions of dollars spent by Medicare and other federal 
health programs to treat sick smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	But last month, Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., quietly slipped a  
provision into a bill funding the Commerce, Justice and State 
departments that would have barred Justice from spending any money 
on such a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats balked, and Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., introduced an  
amendment Thursday removing the offending language. 
</P>
<P>
	``To allow the tobacco industry to escape responsibility ...  
would be totally irresponsible, a surrender of our fiduciary 
responsibility to the taxpayer,'' Graham argued. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham withdrew his amendment after Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, and  
Gregg introduced language into the Senate record nullifying the 
ban. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing in the bill or the report language prohibits the  
department from using generally appropriated funds ... to pursue 
this litigation,'' Gregg said in a statement submitted for the 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats felt confident they had the votes to pass the Graham  
amendment and had hoped to stage a public defeat of the tobacco 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to make certain that the tobacco companies know that  
they have lost and the American taxpayers have won. We are not 
going to accept any half-hearted compromise,'' said Sen. Richard 
Durbin, D-Ill., a vocal opponent of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said that Gregg backed down and agreed to remove the  
language, fearing he could lose a public vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Making their case, Durbin and Graham recalled the Senate's  
success in preventing the federal government from taking a share of 
the money states won in their tobacco settlements. At the time, 
several people said that the federal government should file a suit 
of its own if it wants a piece of tobacco money. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Gregg said today that she did not have any  
comment on the issue beyond what's in the agreement reached 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute moved the Senate back into the tobacco wars of last  
year, at least for a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It never stops,'' said Bruce Reed, Clinton's chief domestic  
policy adviser, who welcomed Thursday's action. ``It's hard to 
believe that Congress would side with the tobacco companies over 
the taxpayers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the U.S. Chamber of Commerce joined the tobacco industry in  
lobbying to keep the ban in the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Department of Justice sues tobacco, then there's no  
business that's really safe from revenue-raising lawsuits,'' said 
the chamber's Jim Wootton. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Democrats prevailed, the Senate bill does not give  
Justice an extra $20 million requested by the president to work on 
the lawsuit. Justice officials decline to say whether they'll be 
able to move forward without the extra money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't do `what ifs,''' Attorney General Janet Reno said. ``I  
think we can work with Congress to make sure that we can still 
proceed.''

<HEADLINE> Feds: Ecstasy Ring Used Hasidim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Federal agents say they busted an international  
drug ring that used conservatively dressed Hasidic Jews as couriers 
for Ecstasy pills. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven men were indicted this week in a scheme that relied on the  
Orthodox Jews' demure look -- black hats, dark suits and sidecurls -- 
to deflect suspicion at customs checkpoints, agents said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jewish couriers were told they were carrying diamonds and  
promised a free trip to Europe and about $1,500 if they agreed to 
retrieve packages in Brussels, Frankfurt and other cities. 
</P>
<P>
	But authorities say the couriers ignored obvious signs that the  
shipments consisted of 30,000 to 45,000 pills destined for sale in 
New York City and Miami Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	One Hasidic defendant, Simcha Roth, 18, was arrested at his  
parents' home Wednesday and charged with recruiting fellow Hasids 
as drug couriers in his hometown of Monsey, N.Y., and Brooklyn. He 
was being held without bail after pleading innocent to drug 
conspiracy and distribution charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an 18-year-old from a good family and is anxious to do  
the right thing,'' Nick DeFeis, Roth's attorney, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth's alleged role is a new twist on a burgeoning trade in  
Ecstasy, a synthetic drug popular in dance clubs. In the past nine 
months, more than 1 million pills were seized from smugglers at 
Kennedy Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	The pills -- which combine the effects of hallucinogens and  
stimulants -- typically are made in Amsterdam, Netherlands, for 50 
cents to $2 apiece, then sold for $25 to $30, authorities said.

<HEADLINE> Mets Get Kenny Rogers From A's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Kenny Rogers is ready to give New York a second  
try, this time in the National League with the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers, who washed out as a high-priced free agent with the New  
York Yankees, was acquired by the Mets from Oakland on Friday for 
two minor leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets, returning from a 6-2 road trip just two games behind  
Atlanta in the NL East, sent outfielder Terrance Long and pitcher 
Leoner Vasquez to the A's for the 34-year-old left-hander. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers is excited about the chance to erase some bad memories  
from his first stay in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look forward to this challenge,'' he said. ``I'm happy it  
worked out this way. It's a chance to go back to New York and pitch 
well. I have something to prove to myself more than anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had heard that other teams had been interested in  
acquiring him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was Boston, New York, Cleveland,'' he said. ``After  
all is said and done, I've always wanted to try the National 
League.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers is in the final year of a $20 million, four-year deal  
that brought him to the Yankees as a free agent before the 1996 
season. He was 12-8 that season with a 4.68 ERA but his pitching 
was spotty. 
</P>
<P>
	The next year he was 6-7, relegated to the bullpen and left off  
the postseason roster. He then was traded to Oakland for third 
baseman Scott Brosius with the Yankees agreeing to pay half his 
salary in 1998 and 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kenny, both publicly and privately, has strongly expressed his  
desire to get back to the East Coast,'' Oakland general manager 
Billy Beane said. ``This desire had become a distraction and given 
our present goals and future needs we felt this trade was 
necessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the A's, Rogers was 16-8 last season with a 3.17 ERA and  
5-3 this season with a 4.30 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I can pitch better than I did,'' he said of his first  
tour in New York. ``There were a lot of different reasons for it. A 
lot happened that was not in my control. I know I'm better than 
that. I can pitch as well as anyone when I'm healthy. The key is to 
get the ball every fifth day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers was asked if he is healthy now.  
</P>
<P>
	``Physically, completely,'' he said. ``Mentally, probably not  
ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was ecstatic about his first year with the Yankees.  
He had health problems then but would not discuss them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's past,'' he said. ``The Yankees knew. That's all that  
matters. It's in the past now. I was more than happy with the first 
year. The second year I just sat in the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect to go out and pitch well for the Mets. I think it  
might be the perfect fit for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Steve Phillips has been trying to upgrade New  
York's pitching for some time and said Rogers was at or near the 
top of his list. In all his talks, though, the price for a pitcher 
always included a pitcher from the Mets' roster. 
</P>
<P>
	``To get Kenny without having to move a starter or an  
upper-level pitcher allows us to keep depth in our pitching,'' 
Phillips said. ``He's one of the best pitchers available and has 
the advantage of not having pitched in the National League before. 
He's a new look to National League hitters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers came to the majors in 1989 with Texas when Mets manager  
Bobby Valentine managed the Rangers. Valentine said he would plug 
Rogers into a six-man rotation, at least temporarily, after the 
pitcher arrives Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's made of the right stuff for our team,'' Valentine said.  
``With our infield and the groundballs he throws, he's a good 
addition to our staff. He's dying to get back to New York and put a 
big notch in his belt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers has a career record of 109-77 in 11 seasons and pitched a  
perfect game for the Rangers on July 28, 1994 against California. 
</P>
<P>
	Long, the 20th pick in the 1994 amateur draft, is hitting .326  
this season with seven homers, 47 RBIs and 14 steals in 78 games at 
Triple-A Norfolk. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're ecstatic over the acquisition of Terrance Long,'' Beane  
said. ``He's a middle-of-the-diamond, five-tool player we feel will 
become a great addition to an already talented group of young 
players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vasquez is 1-2 with a 3.83 ERA and one save in 27 relief  
appearances at Double-A Binghamton. He has 43 strikeouts in 42 1-3 
innings.

<HEADLINE> U S West Income Up 9.4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- U S West Inc., the Baby Bell phone company being  
acquired by Qwest Communications, posted a 9.4 percent gain in 
second-quarter income, buoyed by data and Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver-based company earned $421 million, or 83 cents a  
share, on revenues of $3.26 billion during the three months ended 
June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	That compares with 1998's second-quarter profit of $385 million,  
or 76 cents a share, on revenues of $3.05 billion -- excluding the 
cable TV unit that became MediaOne Group when U S West split into 
two companies last June. The year-ago figures also exclude one-time 
costs of $89 million related to that spinoff. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest results surpassed most Wall Street forecasts,  
according to a survey by the research firm First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	However, U S West's stock fell 50 cents a share Friday to close  
at $57.06 1/4 a share on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Last weekend, U S West agreed to an unsolicited takeover bid by  
Qwest, scrapping an earlier deal to merge with Global Crossing. 
Qwest, which is also based in Denver, outbid Global Crossing with 
an offer of nearly $35 billion in stock. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West said its data-service revenues rose 37 percent in the  
second quarter to $410 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues from wireless calling services more than tripled to $57  
million compared with a year ago, while the subscriber total rose 
by 65,000 to 285,000 during the quarter.

<HEADLINE> Iowa Rep. Bucks GOP on Tax Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Doris Hughes grew up during the  
Depression, believes in paying as you go and she supports Rep. Greg 
Ganske's vote against a $792 billion tax cut over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the maverick Republican congressman from Iowa, the  
69-year-old Hughes is concerned about the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I grew up in the '30s, '40s and '50s,'' she said Thursday,  
briefly putting down the newspaper she was reading in the city 
library. ``Do you think we had credit cards? We didn't. Everybody 
paid cash and that's why people lived sensibly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ganske was among just four Republicans voting against the  
measure Thursday, shifting the battle to the Senate. It passed 
223-208. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of paying for tax cuts, Ganske said the bulk of the  
budget surplus should be used to lower the national debt while 
ensuring a solvent Social Security system. 
</P>
<P>
	``The overwhelming message from my constituents is, `Gee, you're  
finally looking at some surpluses; we think you ought to work on 
paying down the debt,''' Ganske said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 27 percent of those in Ganske's district collect Social  
Security, and 14 percent are age 65 or older, according to U.S. 
Census data. The district has slightly more registered Democrats 
than Republicans, but has almost one-third of its voters registered 
as independents. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone in Ganske's district trusts Congress to use the  
surplus to pay down the debt, and some were unsure how much of a 
cut would be prudent. 
</P>
<P>
	``He must have a very good reason,'' Bruce Felton, 41, said of  
Ganske's vote while cutting hair at Ferg's downtown barber shop. 
Felton said he supports tax cuts, but was waiting for more 
information before casting judgment on his congressman. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it has to be what comes first, it would have to be Social  
Security,'' said Dick Gartin, 73, as he strolled through downtown 
Des Moines. ``I'm afraid people up there don't consider people on 
fixed incomes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and House Democratic leaders argued for a  
considerably smaller level of tax cuts, of around $250 billion. 
Their substitute plan won over only one Republican -- Ganske -- and 
was defeated, 258-173. 
</P>
<P>
	At Ferg's, one customer awaiting a trim argued for tax breaks.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not their money, it's ours,'' said Jerry Leih, 49, a  
banker. ``If we leave it there they're going to spend it. But I 
don't know what the magic number is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ganske said the Republican plan is flawed because it assumes  
surpluses based on ``unprecedented'' economic growth and no 
emergency spending in the next 10 years. The average amount of 
emergency spending in the past decade has been about $9 billion per 
year, Ganske said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look at where we are right now with our agriculture  
problems,'' Ganske said. ``Prices are dropping through the floor 
and I know we are going to have to have something on an emergency 
bill, just on that issue alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ganske and others warn of the strain on the Social Security  
system as the Baby Boomers hit retirement age. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think in the long run, debt reduction helps with the coming  
age wave and the problems we are going to have with that,'' Ganske 
said.

<HEADLINE> Neil O'Donnell Signs With Titans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Tennessee Titans wanted a veteran to  
back up Steve McNair. Neil O'Donnell needed a chance to prove he 
remains a quality NFL quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	He now has a year to prove it.  
</P>
<P>
	The Titans confirmed Friday they have agreed on a one-year  
contract for O'Donnell, who was released by the Cincinnati Bengals 
in April after starting 11 games last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Titans had been looking for a veteran to back up McNair  
since Steve Matthews failed to live up to expectations. Dave Krieg, 
who backed up McNair the past two seasons, had remained an option, 
but at age 40 he was never the first choice. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Floyd Reese said O'Donnell's experience in the  
AFC Central made him a good match. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is the type of player who can come in and win five or six  
games for us in the event of an injury to Steve,'' said Reese. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Donnell, who has been working out on his own in New Jersey,  
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knew when a big play was necessary and was able to convert  
those opportunities,'' said Yancey Thigpen, one of O'Donnell's 
favorite receiver when both were in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, expected to be signed this weekend, differs  
significantly from O'Donnell's previous two contracts. He is due to 
earn approximately $1.1 million, with incentives clauses that could 
add up to $1.5 million more. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals gave him a four-year, $17 million deal last summer,  
only to release him in April after using their top draft choice on 
quarterback Akili Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati signed O'Donnell after the New York Jets cut him  
loose from the five-year, $25 million deal he signed after leading 
Pittsburgh to the Super Bowl in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Donnell started 11 games and played in 13 last season with  
Cincinnati. His quarterback rating was third best in the AFC and 
was 10 points higher than McNair's, but he was benched after 
Cincinnati lost eight of its first 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year he completed 212 of 343 passes (62 percent) for 2,216  
yards, with 15 touchdowns and four interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent his first six seasons in the NFL with Pittsburgh before  
moving to the Jets for two years and then to Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
	He has the best interception ratio in NFL history, with 57  
interceptions in 2,862 attempts. But his three in the 1996 Super 
Bowl were instrumental in the Steelers' loss to Dallas.

	December corn futures prices soared to a three-week high on news  
that the Midwest's heat wave was likely to continue into next week, 
possibly damaging moisture-starved crops. November soybeans prices 
jumped more than 25 cents a bushel to their highest level in more 
than a month. Both contracts cover crops that won't be harvested 
until this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Roose, president of Iowa-based U.S. Commodities Inc., said a  
prolonged drought in key growing areas could keep the rally going, 
particularly with prices just coming up from historic lows. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in a weather market, no doubt about it,'' Roose said.  
``Most weather drought markets build on themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Extended forecasts showing continued heat across the Midwest  
helped corn and soybeans futures gain ground after a mixed day 
Thursday as traders awaited more news on the weather. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service reported after trading ended that  
above-normal temperatures were expected to continue across the Corn 
Belt for at least the next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The forecast showed below-normal to normal levels of  
precipitation across the Midwest -- not enough to make up for the 
soil moisture lost during the extended heat wave. 
</P>
<P>
	Little or no rain was expected in other key growing areas,  
including Southern Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	But Roose warned that a rainy, cool Midwest forecast in the  
coming weeks could wipe out the gains seen during the recent heat 
wave. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat prices saw a boost in sympathy with the increases in corn  
and soybeans. Speculation that President Clinton may announce 
regulations on exports to Iran also bolstered prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 8 3/4 cents to $2.78 3/4 a bushel;  
December corn rose 9 1/4 cents to $2.24 1/2 a bushel; December oats rose 
4 1/4 cents to $1.21 a bushel; November soybeans rose 25 1/4 cents to 
$4.81 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	August lean hogs futures rose the limit of 2 cents a pound for  
the second day in a row on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Lean 
hogs futures prices hit a four-week high amid strong commercial 
buying. 
</P>
<P>
	Producers typically move fewer hogs during hot weather, helping  
boost futures prices. Expectations of better pork demand as the 
Asian economy recovers, coupled with better pork product prices, 
also drove August contracts higher. 
</P>
<P>
	August lean hogs rose 2 cents to 48.87 cents a pound, while  
August pork bellies rose 2.77 cents to 43.37 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee futures prices fell sharply on the Board of Trade of the  
City of New York following a rally Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say early effort to keep the market up failed as many  
traders saw an opportunity to sell after Thursday's jump. 
</P>
<P>
	September arabica coffee fell 3.30 cents to 94.80 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> `Tarzan' Leaps Into Digital Format </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- The King of the Apes is swinging into the  
digital age. 
</P>
<P>
	Walt Disney's animated ``Tarzan,'' in cinemas on traditional  
film for the last month, is debuting in digital format today in 
Walt Disney World's movie complex in Florida and at two California 
theaters. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney executives, who bill ``Tarzan'' as the first all-digital  
release, said Thursday they wanted to give the format a trial-run 
in theaters and let viewers catch a glimpse of the new technology 
expected to revolutionize movie distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	The new format uses technology similar to digital video discs.  
The movie images are digitized, then sent to theaters on discs, 
beamed by satellite or transmitted over fiber-optic cable. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides greatly reducing distribution costs of bulky movie  
reels, digital cinema would give viewers an image that matches or 
exceeds that of film, said Disney executives and officials from 
Texas Instruments, which developed the digital projector being used 
for ``Tarzan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike film, digital movies also will not deteriorate through  
wear-and-tear, said Thomas Schumacher, president of Walt Disney 
Feature Animation. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to see the film right as we made it,'' Schumacher  
said. ``You're going to see it that way in screening No. 2, 
screening No. 20 and screening No. 2,000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few movies, most notably ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom  
Menace,'' had limited releases in digital versions that were 
transferred from film. Disney said ``Tarzan'' was different because 
no film was involved: The hand-drawn animation was digitally stored 
then used to create the digitized version. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney conducted a demonstration Thursday showing scenes from  
``Tarzan'' in film and digital formats side-by-side. The most 
noticeable difference was richer color in the digital version, 
though in some scenes the digital colors were so heavy they made 
the images harder to see. 
</P>
<P>
	Otha Johnson, a manager at the Burbank AMC theater where Disney  
held its demonstration, said that along with a sharper image, 
digital movies make projectionists' jobs easier because they do not 
have heavy film reels to rewind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like the way this is headed,'' Johnson said. ``Ever since I  
saw the digital `Star Wars,' I'm kind of spoiled. I want to see 
digital all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The current pricetag for digital projectors might keep some  
theaters from embracing the switch. Conventional film projectors 
typically cost about $30,000, while a digital system can run three 
times as much. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Barlow, executive vice president for Disney's  
motion-picture group, said a fair number of theaters might be 
equipped with digital projectors in two to four years, though both 
formats likely will be around for the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
	``Film will exist for many, many years,'' Barlow said.  
``There'll be dual inventory for many, many years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob England, manager of digital imaging for Texas Instruments,  
said he took his two nephews to see the regular film version of 
``Tarzan'' a few weeks ago. England received an e-mail from them 
this week saying they wanted to see it again, but in digital 
format, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on that statistical sample of two, digital cinema will  
be a tremendous success,'' England said.

<HEADLINE> KIds' College on Life Insurance? / On the Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Can taking out an insurance policy help the  
average family save for college? Don't bet your (variable) life on 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	More and more, variable life insurance is being touted as a  
great new vehicle to help meet college costs -- it's a savings tool, 
includes tax-deferred investment options and allows for tax-free 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's not for everyone. It can be pricey, has limited tax  
benefits for low- or average-income families and only helps those 
with young children. Besides, many financial advisers say there are 
other ways to save for college. 
</P>
<P>
	``Recommending variable life to the masses of people is a wrong  
thing to do,'' said Raymond D. Loewe, president of College Money, a 
Marlton, N.J., firm that specializes in college planning. ``If 
you're in a high tax bracket, though, it's a magnificent tool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Loewe brought up the use of variable universal life in financing  
college during the July annual convention of the Institute of 
Certified Financial Planners in Dallas. A few financial advisers 
attending a session he ran on crisis college planning said they saw 
the use of variable life as a growing trend among clients who don't 
qualify for financial aid because their incomes are too high. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly on the upswing,'' said David D. Hollands, a  
certified financial planner from Plano, Texas, who recommends it to 
certain clients above the 28 percent tax bracket. ``This is for 
people who have no real expectations of getting financial aid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a variable life contract, you get the same guaranteed death  
benefit as with whole life, except the policy's cash value can be 
invested in tax-deferred stock, bond or money market portfolios. 
Policyholders can shift investments from one portfolio to another 
tax-free, and they pay a fixed annual premium just as they would 
with whole life. 
</P>
<P>
	Life-insurance cash value isn't used when calculating college  
aid, which is a plus for all college planning regardless of income. 
</P>
<P>
	But perhaps the biggest advantage of variable life, according to  
Loewe, is the fact that you can borrow on the cash value, generally 
at low rates of interest and without being taxed. 
</P>
<P>
	So, when a tuition payment comes due, you can take money out of  
the policy without being socked with taxes. Of course, you lessen 
the payout upon death. For instance, if you borrowed $20,000 on a 
$100,000 policy, you'd have $80,000 left. 
</P>
<P>
	But as Loewe noted, policyholders are aware of that and are  
buying variable life mainly for college savings. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there are drawbacks to using variable life for college  
planning. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, policies can be very expensive. Premiums can be  
high, depending on how the contract is fashioned, and the policies 
are often loaded with hefty sales commissions and management fees 
that can erode earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Most variable life policies have penalties if policyholders  
withdraw money during the first 10 years, which is why financial 
advisers recommend against families with older children using them. 
</P>
<P>
	``If your children are under eight that's the optimum age,''  
said Hollands. 
</P>
<P>
	Errold F. Moody, a financial planner from San Leandro, Calif.,  
who runs a consumer Internet site (www.efmoody.com) doesn't think 
anyone should use them for college planning. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's life insurance you're buying. If you don't need life  
insurance, don't buy the stuff,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moody said most individuals who need life insurance should  
purchase a term life policy -- which has no saving or investment 
feature, just a payout upon death -- and invest the rest on their 
own. 
</P>
<P>
	He prefers index funds for families with young children, such as  
ones modeled on Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index. Index funds in 
the big-stock sector of the market have consistently achieved 
better results than most managed funds in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	All the gains, when gifted to the child later on, will be taxed  
on long-term capital rates, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested other tax-sheltered options: an Education  
Individual Retirement Account, where the proceeds aren't taxed, 
though contributions are limited to $500 per child per year; a 
regular IRA, which allows for distributions for college tuition, 
and the Hope Scholarship credit, a $1,500 credit available for 
tuition and fees for the first two years of college. 
</P>
<P>
	Moody said variable life is primarily advantageous for insurance  
agents who stand to reap high commissions. 
</P>
<P>
	``They could put their kids through school,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> 'The Sopranos' Lead Emmy Pack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The lead character is a mob boss, the  
scene-stealer is his scheming mother and the whole show revolves 
around a New Jersey crime family's collective angst. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardly the kind of television show Emmy voters tend to shower  
with awards come September. But HBO's critically acclaimed series 
``The Sopranos'' still nabbed 16 Emmy nominations on Thursday, 
including best drama, the first cable show ever to be recognized in 
the dramatic series category. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope what it is is the character flaws, people identify with  
them,'' ``Sopranos'' creator and producer David Chase said from New 
York after the awards were announced in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Also out in front of the Emmy pack, with 13 bids apiece, were  
Fox's ``Ally McBeal,'' ABC's legal drama ``The Practice'' and the 
CBS miniseries ``Joan of Arc.'' HBO's racy ``Sex and the City'' 
became the second cable series to be nominated as best comedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Although ``The Sopranos'' was the front-runner in nominations,  
some speculate that its cynicism and tough cast of characters might 
turn some people off when it comes time to vote on actual awards. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lack of sympathetic characters and how courageous the show  
is in championing them can hurt its chances,'' said Thomas O'Neil, 
author of ``The Emmys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another HBO series, Garry Shandling's talk-show satire ``The  
Larry Sanders Show,'' also was showered with Emmy nominations 
during its run. But it failed to win the top prize, as best comedy 
series, and O'Neil believes its pervasive cynicism was a factor. 
</P>
<P>
	Other bids for ``The Sopranos'' went to series star James  
Gandolfini; Edie Falco, who plays his wife; Lorraine Bracco, the 
unwilling mob therapist; and to Nancy Marchand, the former ``Lou 
Grant'' star who plays Tony Soprano's treacherous mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the other competitors are colleagues as well: Camryn  
Manheim, Lara Flynn Boyle and Holland Taylor of ``The Practice'' 
are all named in the best supporting actress category. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Franz of ``NYPD Blue'' will be competing for a best actor  
trophy with his former co-star, Jimmy Smits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to say I wouldn't want to win it, because I  
would, but I will be just as happy if his name was announced,'' 
Franz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Emmy winners will be chosen by academy peer panels meeting in  
August. Fox will air the ceremony live on Sept. 12.

<HEADLINE> Union, Shipyard Reach Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMPTON, Va. (AP) -- Newport News Shipbuilding Inc. and the  
Steelworkers union have reached tentative agreement to end a 
15-week old strike against the nation's only manufacturer of 
aircraft carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of steelworkers remain unhappy with the terms of the  
deal, however, raising questions about whether the members of 
Steelworkers Local 8888 will vote to ratify it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will not fly,'' Billy Graves, a Local 8888 senior  
organizer, predicted during a union meeting at the Hampton 
University Convocation Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides reached the tentative deal early Friday morning  
after a week of almost round-the-clock negotiations with a federal 
mediator, union spokesman John Duray said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement would increase wages by an average of $3.10 per  
hour across all production and support pay grades over 58 months, 
including an hourly raise averaging $1.14 that would go into effect 
when the contract is ratified. 
</P>
<P>
	It would increase monthly benefits for current employees who  
retire at 62 with 30 years of experience to $750 immediately and to 
$900 on Jan. 1, 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The union, which represents 9,200 production and maintenance  
workers at the shipyard, had demanded across-the-board raises of 
$3.70 an hour over 36 months. 
</P>
<P>
	The company had offered raises over 47 months, depending on pay  
grade, that it said would boost the average employee's hourly wage 
of $13.50 by $2.49. On pensions, it had proposed a $589 monthly 
pension for a 30-year employee, up from $506, while the union 
wanted $900 a month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't get everything we wanted, but we fought and fought  
and fought until early this morning when we decided there was 
nothing else left for us to get out of Newport News Shipbuilding 
except their guts,'' Local 8888 president Arnold Outlaw told the 
workers, who have been off the job since April 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Some workers booed and yelled as Outlaw spoke. Outside, some  
said the wage increase was too small and others voiced concern 
about the duration of the proposed deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think five years is too long. In the shipyard business, five  
years is a long, long time,'' said Quentin Jones, 45, a shipbuilder 
with 26 years experience. He said a lot of people thought the 
contract should only have been for three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Clarice Diggs, 41, who has worked in welding services at the  
shipyard for 23 years, agreed. ``It gives the shipyard enough time 
to finish all the work for the contracts they have,'' she said, and 
then possibly force pay downgrades or lay off workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The union distributed copies of the proposal with a strong  
recommendation it be approved, and several workers said they wanted 
to review it before deciding. Union members will vote to ratify the 
agreement on Monday or Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Al Little, vice president of human resources at the shipyard,  
said the tentative agreement ``provides a very good pay and 
benefits package for our employees, but keeps within the business 
framework that will allow us to win new work and return value to 
our shareholders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to designing and building huge nuclear-powered  
aircraft carriers, Newport News Shipbuilding also designs and 
builds submarines and repairs Navy ships. The company has about 
18,000 employees, making it the largest private industrial employer 
in Virginia, and has annual revenues of about $1.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Newport News Shipbuilding were down 37 1/2 cents to  
$32.56 1/4 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Compaq Names Unknown Manager CEO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Compaq Computer Corp. prompted surprise and some  
wariness from industry analysts by picking a relative unknown 
manager -- its own chief operating officer of less than two months -- 
to try to turn around the sprawling computer company's flagging 
fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael D. Capellas, 44, was named chief executive and president  
on Thursday after an intense three-month search, as Compaq's board 
moved to plug a big management hole that threatened to further hurt 
shrinking sales and profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Capellas joined Compaq a year ago as chief information officer,  
in charge of its internal computer operations. Before that he 
served as a sales manager at software maker Oracle Corp. Wall 
Street generally had expected Compaq to pick an outside executive 
with seasoned experience in running a major company. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a surprise because they chose a Mr. Insider instead of a  
Mr. Outsider,'' said David Wu, an analyst with ABN AMRO Chicago 
Corp., in San Francisco. But, he added, ``I don't care where he 
comes from, it's what he does that matters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you're going to find too many people out there  
who know too much about him,'' said Richard Gardner, an analyst 
with Salomon Smith Barney Inc. ``He's an unknown quantity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investors appeared to take a wait-and-see attitude, with  
Compaq's stock see-sawing in early trading. After initially rising, 
its shares were down 2 percent, or 37 1/2 cents at $24.62 1/2, in late 
morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	By reaching inside its own ranks, Compaq officials say they  
wanted to tap Capellas' experience, however short-lived, in 
reorganizing the company into more efficient business units aimed 
at responding better to customers' needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to questions about a lack of executive-level  
experience, Capellas stressed that his background as Compaq's chief 
technology officer had helped him better understand customers' 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The strategy is about solving customers' business problems,  
and I have done that all my life,'' he said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Capellas succeeds Eckhard Pfeiffer, who was forced out in April  
after Compaq's first-quarter profit came in at less than half of 
analysts' expectations. The management gap was widened by the 
departure of another half-dozen top managers in Pfeiffer's wake. 
</P>
<P>
	The new chief executive, who takes office immediately, faces a  
challenge in reviving Houston-based Compaq, which has been hit hard 
by slow computer sales and shrinking profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Capellas, at a news conference in New York, gave a lively  
presentation sketching out his major areas of focus, including 
reorganizing the company, bolstering sales of PCs and big business 
machines, and simplifying the company's methods of distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	Capellas also promised a more open management structure, in  
contrast to his predecessor, Pfeiffer, who had been criticized for 
a more insular style. ``I wake in the morning looking for someone 
to talk to,'' he said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Before joining Compaq, Capellas headed software maker Oracle  
Corp.'s sales to oil and gas companies. He also was with 
Schlumberger Ltd., an oil-field services company, for 18 years in a 
variety of management positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Continental Airlines President Gregory D. Brenneman and Oracle  
Corp. President Ray Lane were reported to have turned down the 
Compaq CEO job. Compaq chairman Benjamin Rosen said at the news 
conference that only Capellas was offered the job, but declined to 
name other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	The hiring opens the door for the replacement of other key  
executive positions, including the top human-resources post. Compaq 
named an acting chief financial officer, Ben Wells. Rosen and two 
other board members have performed the duties of chief executive 
since Pfeiffer's departure. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq is expected to report a second-quarter loss of up to $250  
million next week, reflecting the company's troubles in selling 
personal computers as well as bigger business machines. After 
pioneering the market for inexpensive personal computers in the 
early 1990s, Compaq's profits have plunged amid escalating price 
wars. 
</P>
<P>
	The new CEO also faces the challenge of integrating Digital  
Equipment Corp., which Compaq bought for $9 billion a year ago. 
Compaq has had trouble increasing sales of its Alpha business 
computers, which were made by Digital. 
</P>
<P>
	And Compaq has stumbled in trying to cope with the more  
efficient sales model of Dell Computer Corp., which saves money by 
selling computers directly to customers, eliminating the markup 
charged by retailers.

<HEADLINE> US To Sell Food to Iran, Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is preparing to  
allow U.S. companies to sell food and medicine to three countries 
listed as terrorist states -- Iran, Libya and Sudan. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulations are expected to be issued soon and would allow  
U.S. companies to obtain a license from the Treasury Department to 
sell food and medicine to three countries, a department official 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulations would not require congressional approval and  
would take effect immediately unless otherwise stipulated, the 
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The official said the regulations are now going through an  
interagency clearance process involving the Treasury, State, 
Commerce and Agriculture departments. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department announced the intended policy change in  
April. 
</P>
<P>
	At that time, officials said humanitarian aid would be exempted  
from future sanctions. That change is not supposed to affect Iraq, 
North Korea and Cuba, all sanctioned countries to which sales of 
certain items are already permitted. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury official would not discuss details of the  
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear whether the policy change also would mean  
approval for a pending Iranian request to buy more than $500 
million worth of American grain and sugar. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. lawmakers from agricultural states as well as trade groups  
representing rice, soybean, wheat, sugar beet, barley and other 
producers would like to see Iran's request granted. 
</P>
<P>
	Some government experts have predicted that the policy change  
could increase wheat and corn exports by 1 million tons. 
</P>
<P>
	The new policy is part of a broader attempt to overhaul the way  
the United States imposes sanctions. The goal is to resort to 
unilateral sanctions only after all other options, including 
diplomacy and multilateral sanctions, have been exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
	When the State Department announced the policy change, officials  
said that barring sales of food and medicine usually fails to hurt 
targeted regimes while depriving American companies of export 
opportunities.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore named a veteran of the  
Clinton-Gore presidential campaigns to be his campaign press 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Catherine ``Kiki'' Moore, who worked for the 1992 and 1996  
Clinton-Gore campaigns, will fill the empty press secretary slot at 
Gore 2000 starting Sept. 7, campaign general chairman Tony Coelho 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has been making efforts to add women to prominent positions  
on his campaign team. Deputy campaign chairman Marla Romash and 
pollster Celinda Lake were recent hires. 
</P>
<P>
	Since acting as spokeswoman for President Clinton's 1997  
inaugural, Moore was a partner with the Dewey Square Group, a

<HEADLINE> DOE Security Chief Takes Polygraph </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- The Energy Department's new head of  
security says requiring nuclear weapons workers to take lie 
detector tests is no big deal. 
</P>
<P>
	To prove it, he took one himself.  
</P>
<P>
	``I passed it with flying colors,'' Eugene Habiger told  
reporters hours after taking the test at the department's 
Albuquerque field office Thursday. He said laboratory workers 
shouldn't have to do anything he wouldn't do. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, the Energy Department announced plans to give polygraph  
tests to some 5,000 workers in sensitive nuclear weapons jobs, part 
of a broad initiative to beef up security after widely publicized 
accusations of leaks to the Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
	Some lab workers objected to the polygraph testing, fearing that  
errors might incriminate innocent people. 
</P>
<P>
	Habiger dismissed those concerns, saying the way the tests are  
being set up, there should be fewer than one error in 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a big deal,'' the retired Air Force general said.  
</P>
<P>
	Habiger, named in June to head security at the department, was  
in Albuquerque this week to meet with officials at Sandia National 
Laboratories and the department's operations Office.

<HEADLINE> NASA Looks for Ice on the Moon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- By sending a spacecraft smashing into the  
moon, NASA researchers hope to find evidence of lunar ice. But two 
scientists predict the collision will uncover only a concrete-like 
layer of dry soil. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA researchers plan to smack the Lunar Prospector craft into a  
crater on the moon's South Pole on July 31, the final day of the 
lunar orbiter's $63 million, 18-month-long mission to study the 
moon at close range. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts believe water ice may be locked in the frigid soil of  
the deep, constantly shaded crater and that roiling energy of the 
satellite's 3,800 mph impact will free a cloud of water vapor. 
</P>
<P>
	The search for water may be a key to further lunar exploration.  
Water can be chemically reduced to hydrogen and oxygen, which can 
be used as a rocket fuel. Also, the oxygen could be used as a 
breathable gas. The presence of water would reduce the need for 
fuel and oxygen resupply from Earth of a lunar base. 
</P>
<P>
	But Von R. Eshleman and George A. Parks, researchers at Stanford  
University, say in a letter to the journal Science that Lunar 
Prospector is more apt to collide with a concrete-like mineral 
inside the crater than ice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't believe that crater is paved like a roadway, but we  
do believe the soil may be chemically very much like concrete,'' 
Eshleman said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	If there is water on the moon, Eshleman said, it is probably in  
the form of hydrous, or water-containing, mineral crystals. 
</P>
<P>
	Hydrous minerals do contain H2O, but it is so tightly bound  
chemically to the crystals that it would take temperatures up to 
1,500 degrees to break those bonds and extract useful water, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eshleman agrees with National Aeronautics and Space  
Administration scientists that if there is any water on the moon -- 
a highly uncertain possibility -- it probably is in the soils in 
deeply shaded craters at the lunar poles. But once the water got 
trapped there, he said, the water very likely combined with the dry 
lunar soil to form the crystal minerals. 
</P>
<P>
	David Goldstein, a University of Texas researcher who first  
suggested smashing the moon with the Lunar Prospector, conceded 
that some lunar water may be chemically locked in minerals, but he 
thinks there also might be ice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think the chances of there being free water there is about  
10 percent,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldstein said the energy released by the Lunar Prospector's  
crash into the moon will vaporize ice, but not separate water from 
the minerals. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a half cubic meter of soil, the crash will raise the  
temperature by about 400 degrees Kelvin (about 720 degrees F),'' 
said Goldstein, far less than the 1,500 degrees F needed to extract 
the water from a concrete-like crystal. 
</P>
<P>
	This means that if any water is detected from the collision, it  
probably came from ice, not from hydrous minerals, said Goldstein. 
</P>
<P>
	Lunar Prospector was launched Jan. 6, 1998, and has spent 18  
months orbiting the moon. It used instruments to map the lunar 
surface, plot the moon's geology and search for water. 
</P>
<P>
	Data from the spacecraft suggested the presence of hydrogen, a  
key component of water, but could not detect water itself. Radar 
signals from an earlier spacecraft, called Clementine, suggested 
that water ice might be present at the cold lunar poles. And still 
another study, using Earth-bound instruments, detected a group of 
craters at the lunar poles that are constantly shaded from the sun, 
the sites thought the most likely to contain ice. 
</P>
<P>
	The craft will smash into one such shaded crater at about 5:52  
a.m. EDT on July 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``We selected that day because the funding for Lunar Prospector  
runs out on Aug. 1,'' said Goldstein, a member of the spacecraft 
science team. ``We thought this would be a good way to end the 
mission and still get some science.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Controllers will order Lunar Prospector to fire its braking  
rockets, Goldstein said, and if all goes well the craft will 
approach the surface at a shallow angle and smash into the inner 
wall of a 2 1/2-mile deep crater. 
</P>
<P>
	The impact could produce a vapor with as much as 40 pounds of  
water -- about five gallons. A cloud of vapor should become visible 
to powerful telescopes within four seconds after the collision. 
Sunlight is expected to break the water vapor into hydrogen and 
hydroxyl. Telescopes on Earth and in space that can detect 
ultraviolet radiation will be able to tell if the plume contains 
hydroxyl, a key marker for water. 
</P>
<P>
	For amateurs, said Goldstein, there probably won't be much to  
see. 
</P>
<P>
	``I doubt if there will be a flash,'' he said. ``And the vapor  
cloud won't be visible.''

<HEADLINE> Jury Clears Hewlett-Packard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- A jury says Hewlett-Packard didn't  
violate antitrust laws when it changed its printer cartridges and 
made them incompatible with a smaller company's ink refiller. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. District Court jury rejected Nu-Kote International's  
claims of monopolistic behavior on Thursday. It also found that 
Nu-Kote had violated Hewlett-Packard's patents and falsely 
advertised its products. Jurors awarded $2 million in damages 
against Nu-Kote, which filed for bankruptcy last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Nu-Kote's product, first sold in 1993, refilled ink cartridges  
more cheaply than the cost of replacing a cartridge made by 
Hewlett-Packard, the leading maker of printers and cartridges. 
</P>
<P>
	Hewlett-Packard sued Nu-Kote for patent infringement and later  
redesigned its cartridges so that they were refilled from the 
bottom rather the top. Nu-Kote, whose refiller no longer fit HP 
cartridges, accused the larger company of exploiting its market 
position to squash competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Hewlett-Packard, which makes substantial profits from  
replacement cartridges, contended the change was intended to 
simplify manufacturing and help customers avoid mistakes in 
installation. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors agreed. ``It's the company's choice to redesign its  
product,'' jury foreman Frank Rocha said after the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury also accepted Hewlett-Packard's claim that Nu-Kote  
packaged its products to make them look like HP products. 
</P>
<P>
	The packaging was changed in 1995, said Robert Christopher, a  
lawyer for Nu-Kote. He said he would ask U.S. District Judge James 
Ware to overturn the verdict.

<HEADLINE> Spain Further Restricts Smoking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Spain is to ban smoking on all domestic  
flights and intercity buses, as well as impose tighter restrictions 
on trains and ferries under a decree approved Friday by the 
government's cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, smoking was allowed on domestic flights longer than  
90 minutes, smoking sections were permitted on buses, and efforts 
were made to separate smokers from nonsmokers on ferries and 
trains. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban is due to come into effect upon publication of the  
decree in about three months. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month the Spanish flagship carrier Iberia announced  
it would ban smoking on all its flights starting Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent research has indicated that tobacco contributes to a  
third of all deaths in the 50-65 age bracket in Spain, where 
smoking in offices, restaurants and other public places remains 
common. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban was described as ``another aggression'' by a group  
calling itself Smokers for Tolerance. The group's spokesman, Alvaro 
Garrido, said it violated the rights of Spain's 10 million smokers 
-- a quarter of the population -- and could discourage tourists 
seeking a relaxed atmosphere, the news agency Europa Press 
reported.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Rules Out Rebel Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- A government minister has ruled out  
peace talks with insurgents fighting for the independence of 
Indonesia's westernmost province, news reports said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Human rights groups and leading politicians in Aceh province  
have proposed that the government negotiate with the rebels 
following a sharp escalation of violence in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	But State Secretary Muladi said the government would not  
negotiate with members of the Free Aceh Movement because it is not 
a legal organization, the Suara Karya newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Indonesia's national human rights commission  
urged President B.J. Habibie to quickly withdraw troops from the 
province, 1,100 miles northeast of Jakarta, news reports said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia has boosted its military forces in Aceh after eight  
soldiers died and 20 were injured in an ambush Monday. Twenty 
people were killed in a series of clashes last week. 
</P>
<P>
	About 80,000 villagers have been forced to flee homes to evade  
the fighting, human rights activists and medical workers said. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of 100 university students on Friday staged a noisy  
protest in the capital, Jakarta, to demand the government withdraw 
troops and hold an independence referendum for Aceh. They also 
demanded the resignations of the president and military chief, Gen. 
Wiranto, who like many Indonesians uses only one name. 
</P>
<P>
	Chanting ``Allahu Akhbar,'' or God is great, the students  
carried posters condemning Indonesian authorities for allegedly 
committing atrocities in the region.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Sues Aetna Chief Executive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An attorney who won a $120 million verdict  
against Aetna is suing the health insurer's chief executive, 
alleging he defamed the lawyer in remarks published in newspapers 
and on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael J. Bidart's lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court  
yesterday, claims that Aetna Chairman Richard Huber made ``false, 
malicious and vindictive'' statements. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after the January verdict, Huber had said the cash award  
was the work of a ``skillful ambulance-chasing lawyer, a 
politically motivated judge and a weeping widow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The remarks were printed in The Hartford Courant and republished  
in the Los Angeles Times, the Los Angeles Daily Journal and on the 
Internet, the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Joyce Oberdorf, a spokeswoman for Hartford, Ct.-based Aetna,  
said the company is ``flabbergasted that Mr. Bidart has chosen to 
file a defamation lawsuit over a single phrase in a news story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company believes the lawsuit has ``little merit'' and  
intends to vigorously oppose the claim if it goes to trial, 
Oberdorf said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bidart's client, Teresa Goodrich, sued Aetna U.S. Healthcare  
after her husband died from a rare form of stomach cancer in 1995. 
The jury awarded Mrs. Goodrich a record $120.5 million and found 
the company committed ``malice, oppression and fraud'' and 
contributed to the shortening of the life of her husband, David 
Goodrich. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury awarded $116 million in punitive damages and $4.5  
million in medical expenses and loss of companionship. Aetna has 
since appealed. 
</P>
<P>
	yesterday's complaint noted that Huber wrote a letter of apology  
to Goodrich's widow for his remarks, but not to Bidart or the 
judge.

<HEADLINE> Woodstock '99 Literally Sizzles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME, N.Y. (AP) -- Rainstorms that turn the concert grounds into  
mud pits are a Woodstock tradition. Right about now Woodstock '99 
could use one. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of people were treated for heat exhaustion as a  
relentless sun shone on the opening of the three-day concert. More 
than 200,000 people flooded an abandoned military base in upstate 
New York to hear acts like Limp Bizkit, Dave Matthews Band, Korn, 
Metallica and Sheryl Crow. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is sort of a take-your-top-off kind of day, isn't it,''  
Crow asked from one of two giant stages set a mile apart and joined 
by asphalt runways. 
</P>
<P>
	Her blouse remained in place, but thousands of others didn't.  
Men and women alike bared their tattoos, piercings, body paint and 
more in an effort to keep cool in the 90-degree heat. Fans poured 
bottled water over each others' heads, stood under fountains and 
walked through a ``rain tent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet some of the water had to be turned off when some fans turned  
a dirt patch into a mud bath, pelting fellow concertgoers and 
artists with sod. Sultry weather was to continue through the 
weekend, with the chance of showers. 
</P>
<P>
	James Brown opened the show, introduced as the ``general of  
soul'' as he looked out on giant hangars that used to house B-52 
bombers. He belted out ``Cold Sweat,'' about which his audience 
could only dream. 
</P>
<P>
	While original Woodstock announcer Wavy Gravy returned to urge  
fans to take care of each other, he was surrounded by reminders 
that it was a long way from 1969. Skateboarders sailed up ramps in 
an ``extreme sports'' park, vendors sold hemp tacos and people 
complained that cell phone transmission lines were jammed. 
</P>
<P>
	By midday, the crowd was estimated at 220,000. Promoters planned  
for 250,000 but said they would keep selling tickets as long as 
people wanted to get in. Reduced price tickets were available for 
people who wanted to see the last two days. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's 1999, the turn of the century, and this is going to be  
the biggest party of the century,'' said Shawn Hagen, who drove 27 
hours with four friends from Monticello, Minn., to attend the 
concert. 
</P>
<P>
	Candace Redden, 28, drove nearly two days from Canada with two  
friends, leaving their van in Maine when it broke down and renting 
a car. 
</P>
<P>
	``We come from Nova Scotia and not a lot of bands get up  
there,'' Redden said. ``This is an opportunity to see it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police reported three arrests, two for minor offenses and one  
for speeding and driving while intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
	One fan was sent on his way when he entered a state police  
cruiser, thinking it was a taxi, and asked to be taken to a stage. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was just confused,'' said New York State police Maj. James  
Parmley.

	About one-fourth in poll conducted for the AP by ICR of Media,  
Pa., said they plan to take extra cash out of the bank in 
anticipation of problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Haynes, an Elmira, N.Y., construction worker, plans to take  
more dramatic steps with his money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to leave the minimum in the bank to keep the account  
open,'' Haynes said. ``When I get my first statement in January of 
2000, I will say, 'OK, I guess I'm going to trust you guys' and put 
it back in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The poll of 1,008 adults found that women (38 percent) were much  
more likely than men (23 percent) to stock up on supplies. In 
addition, 42 percent of black people planned to take precautions, 
compared with 29 percent of all others. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone poll was taken July 16-21 and has an error margin  
of plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government has been working to fix potential Y2K  
problems in its computers and advising state and local governments 
and private businesses to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
	Without fixes, many computers -- originally programmed to  
recognize only the last two digits of a year -- will not work 
properly beginning Jan. 1, 2000, when those machines will assume it 
is 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, 66 percent said they expected the Y2K bug would cause  
only minor problems in the United States and 18 percent thought 
there would be no problems at all, while 11 percent expected major 
problems. People 65 years old and older were twice as likely as 
those under 35 to expect no problems from the computer glitch, with 
about one-fifth of the older Americans saying there would be no 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	While a majority didn't expect the problems to be serious, there  
was widespread belief they would be pesky. Thirty percent said they 
expected Y2K problems would last for a week or two at the start of 
the year and 32 percent said the problems would persist longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Fears about the banking system may not be warranted because that  
is one business that has worked hard to prepare, said a government 
expert on the Y2K bug. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're confident about any industry, we're confident about  
the banking industry,'' said John Koskinen, chairman of the 
President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the poll found three out of 10 respondents said banks  
would be most at risk from the Y2K bug. Nearly as many said they 
believed the power supply would be the most at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	For Sarah O'Farrell of Montgomery, Ala., the publicity about Y2K  
seems exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is preparing for it,'' the 68-year-old homemaker  
said. ``But I don't think it will have too much effect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. O'Farrell said she doesn't use computers and ``doesn't  
intend to because I have a brain,'' although her daughter has a 
degree in computer science and her grandchildren use computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The experts say it's prudent to be prepared for some problems,  
even if they aren't major. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think there will be significant failures in the  
national infrastructure,'' Koskinen said. ``The power grids look 
like they will hold, telecommunications nationally will function 
... and the Federal Aviation Administration is announcing that 
they're done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said it's harder to tell what will happen locally.  
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, who chairs a Senate Y2K committee,  
said people should ``check your own employer, your own bank, your 
own pharmacist and make contingency plans based on your situation 
rather than on national information.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Canadian aboriginal protesters  
demonstrated outside the site of the opening ceremony of the Pan 
American Games on Friday to press for change in what they say are 
third-world conditions for their people in Manitoba. 
</P>
<P>
	Marchers, including women and children, performed a native dance  
outside the gates. A cordon of police stood between them and the 
stadium, prepared to block any attempt to get closer. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps 200 marchers, including native drummers, walked seven  
miles from downtown Winnipeg to highlight their plight. 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters promised to remain outside Winnipeg Stadium and  
not disrupt the official opening of the Games being attended by 
Princess Anne and other dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to embarrass the government in Manitoba -- one of  
the most racist governments in the country,'' said protest 
organizer Terry Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson said he doesn't want an estimated 100,000 games visitors  
to leave Manitoba thinking there are no problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a protest against the Pan Am Games or the athletes,''  
said Nelson a native activist. ``We don't want them to leave with 
the impression that every thing is great here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson accused local officials of attempting to hide the  
province's racial tensions in an effort to portray the Games 
positively. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, southern Manitoba First Nation, a group of native  
Canadians, opened a casino in defiance of provincial law, saying 
the casino will help improve those deplorable living standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Native leaders say casinos like those operated by tribes in  
other Canadian provinces and the United States are an important 
first step in providing the financial wherewithal to pay for native 
self-government. 
</P>
<P>
	Poverty and inequities in the justice system are two of the main  
issues the protest is trying to highlight, protest organizers said.

<HEADLINE>  Thunderstorm Damages Tiger Stadium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Two panels on the facing of the main press box at  
Tiger Stadium were ripped away during a late-afternoon thunderstorm 
Friday, delaying the start of Detroit's game against Boston for 47 
minutes 
</P>
<P>
	No one was injured when the aluminum-covered plywood panels,  
each approximately 20 square yards, landed in unoccupied seating 
areas below the press box. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm, carrying winds gusting up to 66 mph, came through  
about 4:15 p.m. EDT, 45 minutes before the gates were scheduled to 
open for the 7:05 p.m. game. 
</P>
<P>
	Other panels that were loosened during the storm were roped and  
bolted to prevent them from falling. Tigers president John McHale 
said a crane would be brought in to remove those panels after the 
stadium was cleared following the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a very experienced stadium staff and one of our crowd  
managers is a building inspector and he was the guy we were leaning 
on public safety-wise,'' McHale said. ``They feel there's more than 
adequate support of the panels with the rope fix.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The accident exposed steel along the third deck. The press box  
at Tiger Stadium is one of the highest in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	The seating areas below the damage were sealed off by police  
tape, and persons ticketed to sit there were moved to other areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing leads me to believe anything else will happen, but  
we're not going to take that chance,'' executive director of 
stadium operations Tom Folk said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tigers spokesman Tyler Barnes said approximately 35,000 fans  
were expected Friday night. There was a postgame fireworks display 
scheduled, and Friday was also the first game of a weekend-long 
celebration of the Tigers' 1984 World Series championship team. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the final scheduled season for Tiger Stadium, which was  
built in 1912. The Tigers are slated to move next year to Comerica 
Park, currently under construction about a mile east of the old 
ballpark.

<HEADLINE> Guilty Plea in Molester-Murder Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREEHOLD, N.J. (AP) -- A man has pleaded guilty to child  
endangerment and criminal sexual contact for molesting a teen-ager 
who later murdered an 11-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
	But a judge Wednesday dismissed seven other charges against  
45-year-old Stephen P. Simmons, saying prosecutors did not have 
enough evidence to proceed to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons' affair with teen-ager Sam Manzie came to the attention  
of authorities after the boy told his therapist in 1997. That 
prompted a sting operation by Monmouth County prosecutors in which 
detectives used Manzie as the bait. 
</P>
<P>
	At first Manzie, who had met Simmons in an America Online chat  
room in 1996, cooperated. But later, he smashed wire-tapping 
equipment installed in his room to record conversations with 
Simmons. 
</P>
<P>
	Days later, on Sept. 27, 1997, Manzie lured Eddie Werner into  
his home and strangled him with a cord from an alarm clock. He then 
stuffed the body inside a suitcase and dragged it to a wooded area. 
</P>
<P>
	Manzie, now 17, is serving a 70-year prison term for the  
killing, which his parents and others believe was partly triggered 
by anxiety over his role as a ``junior detective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons faces up to five years in prison at his Oct. 15  
sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons, who admitted to sexually touching Manzie in a Freehold  
movie theater on Aug. 10, 1996, had offered to admit to the two 
charges early in the case. Prosecutors, however, believed they 
could convict him of seven other charges, including sexual assault, 
and rejected his offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The case fell apart when Manzie refused to testify or  
corroborate his earlier statements. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward P. Werner, the father of Manzie's victim, said it was  
tragic that Simmons will serve a relatively short prison term. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a horrible result,'' Werner said. ``It's very  
predictable that he'll continue to prey on minors. It's tragic that 
the prosecution ended that way.''

<HEADLINE> Albright Takes Alaska Fishing Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright  
tried her hand at salmon fishing but quickly got tangled in another 
angler's line. ``I need the whole river,'' she joked during a 
recreational break from diplomacy on her way to a conference in 
Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright's overnight visit, built around a refueling stop at  
Elmendorf Air Force Base, included a sight-seeing flight over 
nearby glaciers and fiords and a visit to a fishing lodge in 
Soldotna, about 150 miles southwest of Anchorage on Alaska's Kenai 
Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing on an elevated wooden walkway, Albright cast a fly  
several times into the fast-flowing Kenai River, a popular 
destination for salmon fishing. She was coaxed on by Alaska Gov. 
Tony Knowles, who had caught a 60-pound king salmon from a boat in 
roughly the same spot the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do need a lesson,'' Albright conceded.  
</P>
<P>
	Albright's visit came as she headed to Singapore for a meeting  
with Asian leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	When she failed to land anything after a few tries, her aides  
were characteristically diplomatic, contending she had been 
casting, not fishing, and that next time she would be fishing. Bob 
Penney, the owner of the lodge, promised to give her more lessons 
if she'd come back. 
</P>
<P>
	A local sporting goods store owner, Jim Golden, presented her  
with a temporary fishing license. ``She's legal,'' he joked. 
Albright shook his hand and thanked him. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright stayed long enough to eat some grilled pieces from the  
salmon the governor had caught. She apologized for her short visit, 
but noted, ``This is about as long as I'm anywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anchorage is a traditional refueling stop for presidents,  
secretaries of state and other government dignitaries headed for 
Asia. But few spend more than a few hours here. 
</P>
<P>
	After arriving at Elmendorf at midday Thursday, Albright and her  
traveling party boarded a two-engine, propeller-driven aircraft for 
a flight south to the Seward area, and then over the massive 
Harding Icefield and the Kenai Fjords National Park. 
</P>
<P>
	They then landed for the visit to the fishing lodge.  
</P>
<P>
	In remarks to U.S. forces stationed at Elmendorf, Albright said  
a key subject of the upcoming meeting of Asian nations in Singapore 
would be tensions caused by wide speculation that North Korea was 
on the verge of launching another multistage missile, as it did 
last August. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling Korea ``perhaps the most dangerous place on Earth  
today,'' Albright said, ``our goal is to encourage the government 
of North Korea to end its isolation and choose the path of 
cooperation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After attending the Association of South East Asian Nations  
meeting, Albright plans to stop briefly in Kosovo July 29 and visit 
with U.S. peacekeeping forces in the battle-scarred province. 
</P>
<P>
	She is due to fly to Bosnia with President Clinton the next day  
for an international conference on economic reconstruction in the 
Balkans.

<HEADLINE> Midwest Flooding Displaces 1,500 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WAVERLY, Iowa (AP) -- About 1,500 people were chased from their  
homes and forced to find alternative shelter after the Cedar River 
flooded 65 city blocks of this northeast Iowa town. 
</P>
<P>
	The residents were evacuated Thursday as the river spilled its  
banks and covered Iowa Highway 3 -- the main street through this 
Bremer County community of about 8,500 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Most stayed with family members or at shelters set up at area  
churches and a local college. They were expected to return to their 
homes to survey damage today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I grew up here and I can remember the river flooding a lot  
when I was a boy, but we haven't had a flood like this for quite 
sometime,'' Police Chief Arthur Simpson said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Waverly was cut in two as the river crested in the morning at  
just over 21 feet -- 2 feet higher than the previous record set in 
1993. As many as 650 homes and a dozen downtown businesses were 
affected. No injuries were reported and a damage estimate was not 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	Electricity in Waverly, a town of 8,500, was shut off and  
residents were told to lock their doors as they left Thursday 
night. City engineer Mike Cherry said about 200,000 sandbags had 
been placed around town and at the city's water and sewage plant 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, waters were rising a few miles downstream in the  
adjoining cities of Cedar Falls and Waterloo, where residents were 
bracing for near record flooding when the river crests this 
afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Seattle's Stadium Not a Homer Haven </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- After its first homestand, Safeco Field has hit a  
home run with Seattle Mariners fans. 
</P>
<P>
	There's one catch for baseball's most prolific power team,  
though: There won't be as many home runs for the Mariners in their 
new home. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're so used to the Kingdome that we still feel like we're on  
the road,'' Edgar Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've said it over and over,'' Alex Rodriguez added. ``We won't  
win games the way we did in the Kingdome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners split their first eight games in their classy new  
$517.6 million ballpark. They hit eight home runs and their 
pitchers surrendered eight in games against San Diego, Arizona and 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	The stadium's retractable roof was open for six of those games.  
An average of 44,043 fans turned out to see the first major-league 
ball played here on green grass and under blue skies since the 
Seattle Pilots played at minor-league Sick's Stadium in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	Safeco got rave reviews from just about everybody. Among the  
exceptions were some of the hitters. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's big,'' Martinez said. ``The field is big. It's a bigger  
stadium. A lot of people hit balls in the gaps, in left center, in 
right center. The ball doesn't carry like it does in the corners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Griffey Jr., who hit one home run during the homestand,  
refused to talk about the stadium's merits and demerits. But he was 
believed to be unhappy the field was affecting his offensive 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	In 37 games in the Kingdome this season, Griffey had 13 home  
runs and 37 RBIs while hitting .306. At Safeco, he's hit .233 with 
three RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez, the 1996 AL batting champion who had a career-high 42  
homers last season, hit three homers during his first Safeco 
experience, including one Sunday against the A's. It went 397 feet 
into the Mariners' bullpen in left. 
</P>
<P>
	``I crushed it,'' he said. ``If you devour the ball, it will go  
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And if a hitter doesn't crush it at Safeco, he's likely to make  
an out. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez, 23, doesn't think center field at Safeco is fair to a  
power hitter because it's so hard to hit a ball out there. He calls 
Safeco the antithesis of Coors Field in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	``What it does, it exploits weaknesses of baseball players if  
you're not careful,'' Rodriguez said. ``You have to be more diverse 
at your game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In their first eight games at Safeco, the Mariners hit .270 and  
their pitchers had an ERA of 4.99. 
</P>
<P>
	In 39 games in the Kingdome this season, the Mariners hit .297  
with 75 home runs, while their pitchers had a 6.70 ERA and 
surrendered 59 homers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Kingdome was much more hitter-friendly,'' Piniella said.  
``This park here, if you hit it you get rewarded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez and Griffey will become free agents after the 2000  
season. The Mariners say they'll do everything they can to keep 
them here, but the stadium that they helped build with their 
hitting heroics in the '90s could cause their departure. 
</P>
<P>
	Piniella is aware that some of his hitters are grumbling, and  
says the fences could be brought in in the future to reduce the 
size of the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to experiment this year with it,'' he said.  
``I'm sure that if it needs to be brought in, they'll do that. I 
don't think anything is set in stone here. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I think before the club does anything, they want to have a  
pretty good trial balloon up. Certainly this year is going to be 
the trial balloon.''

and then briefly flew the plane carrying more than 500 people 
before he was overpowered, according to officials and news reports. 
</P>
<P>
	No one else was injured aboard the All Nippon Airways Boeing  
747, flying from Tokyo to the northern city of Sapporo, 
Transportation Ministry officials said. The plane returned to the 
capital about an hour after taking off. 
</P>
<P>
	Two minutes after takeoff, the hijacker, Yuji Nishizawa, pulled  
out an 8-inch knife and pressed it to a flight attendant's back, 
forcing her to take him into the cockpit, officials said. The 
28-year-old unemployed man, a fan of computer flight-simulation 
games, reportedly just wanted to fly a real plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Nishizawa forced the co-pilot out and ordered the pilot to steer  
toward the U.S. military's Yokota Air Base in western Tokyo, media 
reports said. When the pilot refused, the hijacker stabbed him in 
the neck, seized the controls and tried to steer there himself, 
news reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	After a sudden drop in altitude, the co-pilot and another man  
burst into the cockpit and pounced on the hijacker, tying him up 
with neckties. 
</P>
<P>
	Nishizawa was arrested after the plane landed, said Norio  
Chichi, deputy police chief at Haneda Airport. The government 
tightened security at airports across Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot, Naoyuki Nagashima, 51, was pronounced dead by a  
doctor on board shortly after Flight 61 landed, Transportation 
Ministry official Satoshi Iwamura said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chichi said Nagashima suffered stab wounds in the neck and  
shoulder. The pilot bled to death, said ministry official Fumihiko 
Oinuma. The death was the first ever for a passenger or crew member 
in Japan's 20 airplane hijackings since 1970, Oinuma said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, speaking in Parliament, said he  
sent his condolences to the pilot's family. 
</P>
<P>
	Passenger accounts depicted a flight thrown into quiet fear when  
the hijacker, hair askew and dirty white gloves on his hands, 
pulled out a knife and pressed it to the back of a female flight 
attendant. 
</P>
<P>
	``Take me to the cockpit,'' Chichi quoted the hijacker as  
saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers said they hunkered down.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was afraid to look at his face because he might say `What  
are you looking at?' and take a stab at me,'' said a 61-year-old 
passenger, who only identified himself by his last name, Okawa. 
</P>
<P>
	Okawa and another passenger, Yasuhiro Fukuda, a 42-year-old  
musician, said the plane suddenly lost altitude when the hijacker -- 
still holding the flight attendant -- burst into the cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen the ground so close before; I really thought  
this was it,'' Fukuda said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear who took control of the plane after the cockpit  
fight. TBS television reported that the co-pilot landed the plane, 
but the Kyodo News agency reported that another pilot who happened 
to be on board took the controls. 
</P>
<P>
	Chichi said the hijacker was very agitated during questioning  
and was difficult to understand. Fuji TV reported he suffered from 
depression. 
</P>
<P>
	News reports said he wanted to fly under Tokyo's majestic  
Rainbow Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight 61 reported the hijacking shortly after takeoff from  
Haneda airport in Tokyo, said Transportation Ministry official 
Hitoshi Ishiyama. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said there were signs that the hijacker was troubled  
before he pulled out his knife. 
</P>
<P>
	Passenger Yoshiko Kawase, 60, said she noticed the man while he  
was still in his seat because he appeared nervous and was wearing 
gloves. 
</P>
<P>
	After the hijacker entered the cockpit, Kawase heard a man  
``shouting in a threatening voice'' but said she was unable to 
understand what he was saying. 
</P>
<P>
	The passengers, who were later taken to a nearby hotel, said  
flight attendants and others on board were quiet and calm 
throughout the ordeal, despite the clear sound of fighting coming 
from the cockpit. The crew showed videos of the popular ``Pokemon'' 
cartoon to keep children from panicking, passengers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The last hijacking in Japan was on Jan. 20, 1997, when a man  
armed with a kitchen knife commandeered a flight from Osaka to the 
southern city of Fukuoka. 
</P>
<P>
	He was arrested shortly after the plane landed in Fukuoka, and  
none of the 192 people on board that time was injured.

<HEADLINE> German WWII POW Finishing NY Mural </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YOUNGSTOWN, N.Y. (AP) -- As a prisoner of war, Ernst Wille spent  
his days behind a paintbrush, filling a wall with an image of 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time he was captured at Normandy on D-Day, the young  
German soldier had seen enough of war. He had watched the serene 
beach he'd painted 36 hours earlier turn red with blood and, after 
his capture, helped pile the lifeless bodies left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	At the western New York fort where he was held for 18 months,  
Wille's talent, recognized by his captors, allowed him to pursue a 
more hopeful vision. 
</P>
<P>
	While other German and Austrian POWs labored in local peach  
groves, Wille painted portraits of fellow prisoners, officers, 
their families, and a mural in the Officers' Club which he would 
not have time to finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now.  
</P>
<P>
	At age 82, Wille on Friday put the finishing touches on the  
mural he started 55 years ago. He is donating it and 11 other works 
to the state of New York, hoping they will be displayed for the 
public in the now unused Officers' Club. A private citizens' group 
is trying to turn the club into a museum. 
</P>
<P>
	``My problem was, it was not finished and that's why it kept  
coming into my mind,'' Wille said through his friend and 
interpreter, Rolf Goellnitz, recalling his decades-long desire to 
complete the mural. ``Normally, when something is done, it's out of 
my mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pastel-tinted mural depicts the history of Old Fort Niagara,  
a 300-year-old fort established by the French in the 
northwesternmost corner of the state and later controlled by 
Britain and finally, the United States. Wille was held in barracks 
at the fort from 1944-46. 
</P>
<P>
	In one section of the painting, a Canadian soldier and an  
American soldier extend outstretched arms toward one another in a 
sign of peace. Elsewhere, two cannons face away from each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did not want to depict death and dying. That's why the  
cannons are facing apart,'' said RoxAnn Madera, who helped set up 
the exhibit of Wille's work. 
</P>
<P>
	The mural is in water-based paint on a ``canvas'' of  
sewn-together Army bedsheets and covers a wall in the Officers' 
Club ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
	It was on his first return visit to the United States in 1976  
that Wille saw his painting for the first time since the war. 
Before the trip, he wrote to the town of Youngstown explaining that 
he had begun the painting as a POW, but had been shipped out 
without warning after the war's end, leaving the mural, his 
preparatory work and research behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just wanted to know if it still existed,'' Goellnitz said.  
</P>
<P>
	Upon seeing it again, the artist decided to more strongly  
incorporate the Niagara River on which Old Fort Niagara sits. As a 
prisoner, he had not been able to view the river's power, but as a 
tourist quickly grew to appreciate it. 
</P>
<P>
	Wille made gifts of his other works, including the beach scene  
at Normandy that he had completed and mailed the day before the 
Allied invasion, and a tribute to Duke Ellington. 
</P>
<P>
	The Officers' Club jukebox gave Wille his first taste of  
American jazz and three large paintings pay homage to Ellington's 
``Black, Brown and Beige Suite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Educated at the Academy of Art in Munich, Wille taught art at  
the University for Art and Design at Aachen until 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	His work, paintings and sculptures, are displayed in many German  
museums, including Cologne's Kunsthalle museum. His bronze 
sculptures decorate City Hall in Cologne, where he lives, and a 
monument honoring victims of the Holocaust stands in Aachen, 
Germany.

<HEADLINE> Merce Cunningham celebrated at 80 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Merce Cunningham, the modern dance pioneer who  
likes to use chance to determine how his dancers move, was 
celebrated at Lincoln Center Festival 99 in an evening titled 
``Merce Cunningham: a Lifetime of Dance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Longtime friend and fellow dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov performed  
a new duet with the 80-year-old choreographer at Wednesday night's 
gala. Cunningham created ``Occasion Piece'' especially for the 
event. Music was John Cage's ``Music for Marcel Duchamp,'' a piano 
piece composed for Cunningham's ``Walkaround Time'' in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham also received the city's highest award in the arts.  
</P>
<P>
	Schuyler Chapin, New York City cultural affairs commissioner,  
presented the Handel Medallion to Cunningham from the stage of the 
New York State Theater. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your lifetime of achievement has brought honor to the city,  
our country and to the world,'' Chapin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham responded, saying, ``This is my 60th year of  
performing. I came to New York in September 1939 and in December 
that year I danced on Broadway with Martha Graham. From the first 
day, this was home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is frequently said of Cunningham that he doesn't just have  
his own decentralized style of modern dance but that he made 
audiences look at dance in a new and different way. Enjoyment comes 
in watching his dances as a visual rather than an emotional 
experience, though emotion can, surprisingly, sometimes be felt. A 
couple dances at one side of the stage while a couple at the other 
side does entirely different movements, a group center stage is 
involved in something else and a lone dancer or two stand 
motionless. Movement and spacial relationships are important, but 
plot is not. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham's dances don't grow out of music; sometimes, movement  
is determined by the toss of a coin. Music, often avant-garde, is 
an element but dancers often only hear a work's music for the first 
time after they've learned the dance. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his duet with Baryshnikov, Cunningham also gave  
the audience ``Summerspace'' from 1958. Cunningham restaged 
``Summerspace'' for the New York City Ballet in 1966 and six 
dancers from the company danced it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Biped,'' which had its premiere in April in Berkeley, Calif.,  
received its New York premiere. As interesting as the dancing was -- 
with dancing skeleton lights -- the modern ``decor'' that 
accompanied it was even more fascinating. 
</P>
<P>
	The evening closed with Cunningham's ``Sounddance'' from 1975.

	Bodies of 14 found in Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	PRIZREN, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The bodies of 14 men, apparently  
Serbs, were found on a farm road in central Kosovo after a NATO 
patrol heard shots in the area, a spokesman for the peacekeeping 
force said Saturday. NATO condemned the killings and appealed for 
calm. The grisly report came a day after German Chancellor Gerhard 
Schroeder, in the first visit to Kosovo by a Western government 
leader, pledged moral and material aid to ethnic Albanians and 
Serbs but told them democracy was the key to their future.

	Sen. Kennedy Delivers JFK Jr. Eulogy  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In a heartbreakingly familiar scene, John F.  
Kennedy Jr. was eulogized today as a free spirit who carried the 
torch of America's first family of politics with unusual ease and 
grace and -- like his father -- ``had every gift but length of 
years.'' ``He was a boy who grew into a man with a zest for life 
and a love of adventure,'' said Sen. Edward Kennedy, JFK Jr.'s 
uncle. The memorial Mass came a week after the young Kennedy's 
plane crashed off Martha's Vineyard -- killing him, his wife, 
Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and sister-in-law Lauren Bessette.

	RABAT, Morocco (AP) -- President Clinton is planning to attend  
the funeral of King Hassan II of Morocco, who died today of a heart 
attack at age 70. Hassan helped forge Mideast peace and ruled his 
North African country for 38 years. He was succeeded by his son, 
Crown Prince Sidi Mohamed. Clinton said in a statement that Hassan 
``worked to break down barriers among the peoples of the Middle 
East, bravely opening a dialogue with Israel, ... seeking greater 
tolerance and stability in the region.''

plane crashed shortly after dawn in rugged jungle covered slopes on 
Fiji's main island of Viti Levu, about 40 miles northwest of the

	Bangladesh Floods Ease  
</P>
<P>
	DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Hopes were raised today in Bangladesh  
that flooding, which has displaced or stranded nearly 1 million 
people in the past two weeks, is finally easing. The Flood Forecast 
and Warning Center said water levels in the Brahmmaputra, Ganges 
and Meghna basins would continue to fall tomorrow, although some 
rivers may still overflow. Many people have been waiting for food 
and medicine for days, relief officials said. Floods occur every 
year in Bangladesh, a delta nation of 125 million people and 230 
rivers that run down the Himalayas into the Bay of Bengal.

	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will refuse a  
request by Israel's prime minister to combine implementation of the 
Wye River peace accord with talks on a final peace agreement, an 
Arafat aide said today. Ehud Barak is expected to ask for changes 
in the interim agreement tomorrow during his second talks with 
Arafat since he was elected prime minister in May. Under Wye, 
Israel was to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank in three 
stages by January of this year.

of Boston right-hander Tomokazu Ohka continued as the Tigers beat 
the Red Sox 14-5 Friday night. Ohka (0-2) gave up three runs in the 
Detroit first. Ohka, signed last November from the Japanese 
professional league, yielded seven runs on nine hits in 4 2-3 
innings. A late-afternoon thunderstorm, which ripped away two 
panels on the facing of the main press box at Tiger Stadium, 
delayed the start of Detroit's game against Boston for 47 minutes. 
No one was injured.

<HEADLINE> Soccer Team Can't Wait To Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- It's no wonder the U.S. women's soccer  
team couldn't wait to get started at the Pan American Games. The 
players still were feeling the vibes from the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``What a tremendous inspiration,'' said midfielder Lauren  
Molinaro, who was in the Rose Bowl stands when the United States 
beat China for the world title. ``We're feeding off their energy 
from the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was good for all of us, and it drives us harder to  
fulfill our dreams and be a part of that team in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Soccer sent the girls' under-20 squad to the Pan Ams. The  
team won 6-0 Friday against Costa Rica as Molinaro scored twice. 
</P>
<P>
	While these women are eyeing the 2003 World Cup and 2004  
Olympics, they are not babes in the woods. Molinaro, for instance, 
played with national team defender Sara Whalen and is friends with 
super sub Shannon MacMillan. Midfielder Jena Kluegel attends soccer 
powerhouse North Carolina, where her teammates have included World 
Cup starter Cindy Parlow and reserves Lorrie Fair and Tiffany 
Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's awesome to play with them,'' Kluegel said. ``They are  
great players and people. I went in and was nervous at the first 
practice, wondering what will I do, but they make you feel better 
about yourself and they make you better as a player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone on the Pan Ams squad has played in international  
matches. The team is coached by Jay Hoffman, who was an assistant 
with the World Cup squad. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman brings 18 years of knowledge as a coach, plus a direct  
connection with the world champs. He likes what he sees from his 
current team, even though it doesn't have nearly the training time 
together as the national team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We brought them in in June for a week,'' he said, ``and they  
played two exhibitions. We then made changes because of 
availability of some players, got back together last Friday in San 
Diego, then came here. It's a matter of getting them together and 
familiar with each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, many of the U.S. players know each other. Thirteen  
have college experience and several have faced off on the field for 
their schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playing against some of these girls, things happen on the  
field,'' Kluegel said. ``But it's all forgotten when we come into 
this event and we're on the same team. We are here and want to win 
and have fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman has emphasized to his players the importance of doing  
well at the Pan Am Games. Naturally, they're thrilled to represent 
their country. But the Pan Ams also are an opportunity to display 
their skills for possible future appearances with the U.S. team, in 
events such as the World Cup and Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the first time out of the blocks for the women and what I  
like is they made it an age specific event,'' Hoffman said. ``It 
gives them another chance to make another step. At the same time, 
it gives U.S. Soccer looks at the development of these young 
players for the next two Olympics and the World Cups coming up. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an international competition and it is promoting the  
sport within our hemisphere and getting other countries involved 
with women's teams, and that can only help the sport. And this type 
of competition, needing good results, gives them exposure in what 
it takes at the highest level.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> NASCAR Crew Chief McReynolds Stays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG POND, Pa. (AP) -- Crew chief Larry McReynolds, unable to  
complete a deal to start his own Winston Cup team in 2000, will 
remain with Richard Childress Racing the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	McReynolds called the shots last year when seven-time series  
champion Dale Earnhardt won his only Daytona 500. His contract 
expires after this year and he said Friday he will work for 
Childress through the 2002 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy to get something done and settled about this whole  
mess and put everything to rest,'' McReynolds said at Pocono 
International Raceway, where he's preparing Mike Skinner's car for 
Sunday's Pennsylvania 500. 
</P>
<P>
	McReynolds, whose 23 career victories is the fourth-best figure  
among active crew chiefs, switched jobs with Kevin Hamlin midway 
through last season. Hamlin went with Earnhardt and McReynolds with 
Skinner, the 1997 rookie of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	McReynolds had hoped to join Indiana businessman John Dangler in  
fielding a new team next year. But they were unable to land a major 
sponsor, although McReynolds thought Tide was going to back them. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tide, which said it would no longer sponsor owner-driver  
Ricky Rudd beyond this season, went with Cal Wells III, a CART car 
owner moving to NASCAR next year. 
</P>
<P>
	McReynolds said his work with the Lowe's Chevrolet team was not  
affected by negotiations to start his own operation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not want everyone to think that the No. 31 was my second  
fiddle, and I would just stay if my attempts to start my own team 
fell through,'' McReynolds said. ``I would not stay if my heart was 
not here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Childress said McReynolds is one of the top crew chiefs, and he  
would not block him from becoming a car owner. 
</P>
<P>
	``If, within the course of the next couple of years Larry still  
wants to pursue his dream as a car owner and something comes up 
that presents that opportunity, then we can certainly sit down and 
discuss it,'' Childress said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, two-time series champion Terry Labonte's agreed on  
a three-year contract with Hendrick Motorsports. Labonte, who plans 
to extend the Winston Cup record for consecutive starts to 621 on 
Sunday, has driven for Hendrick since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``I intend to finish my career here,'' said Labonte, who has  
been in every Winston Cup event since the start of the 1979 season.

<HEADLINE> Birth Control Program Goes National </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A privately funded program making its way across  
the country pays $200 to drug-addicted women to get their tubes 
tied or use some other long-term means of birth control. 
</P>
<P>
	The California-based program has drawn the wrath of critics who  
call it short-sighted, racist and a source of drug money for users. 
</P>
<P>
	But Barbara Harris of Anaheim, Calif. -- founder of CRACK, for  
Children Requiring a Caring Kommunity -- says this is a response to 
a system that often fails to punish women who give birth to 
drug-addicted babies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't believe that these women are able to stop by the local  
hospital yearly, drop off a damaged baby and walk away,'' Ms. 
Harris, who has adopted four children born with cocaine in their 
systems, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	CRACK gets funding from private donations. Among Ms. Harris'  
financial backers is Dr. Laura Schlessinger, the tough-talking 
radio host who pushes personal responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1994, Ms. Harris said, CRACK has paid $200 each to 57  
California women who had given birth a total of 262 times. She said 
some men have inquired about vasectomies but never followed 
through. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the program is catching on in Chicago, Minneapolis, Fort  
Pierce, Fla., and Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the acceptable forms of long-term birth control are  
Norplant, which are capsules that are inserted under the skin in 
the upper arm, and the IUD, or intrauterinve device. Tube-tying is 
the most controversial method because it is not always reversible. 
</P>
<P>
	CRACK does not pay for the procedures, though those are often  
covered by state-funded health-care programs, Ms. Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyle Keller, a Chicago social worker, is trying to get CRACK  
going in Chicago, using his own money to advertise the campaign 
with fliers and billboards. So far, he said, he has gotten 
responses from two women. 
</P>
<P>
	``IF YOU ARE ADDICTED TO DRUGS get birth control -- get $200  
cash,'' read the two billboards, which went up earlier this month 
in poorer neighborhoods. ``Stop the cycle of addicted newborns 
now!'' 
</P>
<P>
	To get the cash, women must have a form signed by doctor  
detailing the form of birth control they are using. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharon Adams is one of the California mothers who decided to  
have her tubes tied -- in her case, after having her 14th child. 
</P>
<P>
	``I figured it was about time to do it -- and the $200 motivated  
it,'' said Ms. Adams, 38. 
</P>
<P>
	Now drug-free for two years, she is working a pizza delivery  
driver, caring for one of her children and trying to regain custody 
of two others. Four of her children died because of complications 
caused by drugs, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Trombley, president of Planned Parenthood in Chicago, said  
he doubts most addicts have the judgment to make such a big 
decision. ``Coercing women by bribing them with cash is not the way 
to go about it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Constance Jackson, president of Altgeld Health Clinic, which  
serves poor patients on Chicago's South Side, questioned whether a 
program like CRACK would be gaining momentum if most drug-addicted 
babies were white. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at adoptions,'' Ms. Jackson said. ``White babies are more  
precious than platinum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Harris, who is white, countered that most of the mothers who  
have been paid in California are white. ``Race shouldn't even be 
the issue,'' she said. ``It's about child abuse -- and black babies 
matter, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She does not deny some mothers will simply use the payment to  
buy drugs. ``But they're already going to find the money for drugs 
anyway,'' Ms. Harris said. ``That's one less person to rob or a few 
less tricks to turn.''

<HEADLINE> Elf Board Rejects TotalFina's Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- As expected, Elf Aquitaine's board rejected Friday  
a $42.81 billion takeover bid by TotalFina. 
</P>
<P>
	Elf Aquitaine's chief also dismissed the possibility of any kind  
of ``under-the-table negotiations'' to reach a deal after his 
counterpart suggested the two companies seek a ``friendly 
solution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The action Friday comes in light of Elf's $50.97 billion  
counterbid for TotalFina, announced Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	TotalFina is offering four of its shares for three Elf shares,  
with its offer being conditional on gaining control of 66.67 
percent of Elf. In its counteroffer, Elf is offering three of its 
shares plus cash for five TotalFina shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The big difference is that Elf has proposed to spin off the  
groups' chemicals business into a separate company. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of TotalFina, Thierry Desmarest, suggested on Thursday  
that the two companies seek a ``friendly solution'' to the growing 
hostility. 
</P>
<P>
	Elf President Philippe Jaffre said in an interview published  
Friday that he won't engage in any informal talks to resolve the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be no under-the-table negotiations nor arrangements  
in a corner,'' Jaffre told the financial daily Les Echos. ``The 
discussion on the industrial project, on the creation of value for 
shareholders, precedes any reflection about the management 
structure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All of Elf's board members rejected TotalFina's bid and  
recommended that Elf shareholders not tender their shares, Elf said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	French stock market regulator Conseil des Marches Financiers  
said TotalFina's all-stock bid for rival Elf announced July 5 
officially opened on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that Elf has filed its official response, the CMF is  
expected to set a closing date for the bid.

<HEADLINE> Panel Approves $4.5B for Census </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House subcommittee voted to declare next  
year's constitutionally required census an emergency, paving the 
way to paying its $4.5 billion cost by dipping into the expected 
federal surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	That declaration angered some Democrats, in part because just  
weeks ago many Republicans accused President Clinton of budget 
gimmickry when he proposed that U.S. aid to Central American 
countries battered by killer hurricanes last autumn should be 
considered an emergency. Congress eventually voted to go along. 
</P>
<P>
	``They made such a fuss about the emergency for the Latin  
American hurricanes,'' said Rep. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y. The census, 
he said, ``has been in the Constitution a couple of hundred 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The census spending was included in a $35.8 billion measure  
financing the State, Justice and Commerce departments for the 
coming fiscal year that a subcommittee of the House Appropriations 
Committee approved by voice vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said they turned to the emergency declaration  
because without it, they would have had to make deep cuts in the 
rest of that spending bill. Under budget law, declaring an 
emergency allows lawmakers to spend the surplus and skirt legally 
required spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's in agreement we have to move this process  
forward,'' said Rep. Zach Wamp, R-Tenn., referring to the GOP's 
flagging effort to approve all 13 spending bills for the coming 
fiscal year. ``We're out of other options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vote occurred shortly after Republicans pushed a $792  
billion, 10-year tax cut through the House, a cut that would be 
paid for with projected federal surpluses. The temptation to use 
next year's projected $14 billion surplus for the census, and 
possibly other spending items, could eat into the very 10-year 
surplus that Republicans want to use for tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	The $4.5 billion was virtually the entire amount Clinton  
requested for the census, which the Constitution requires every 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Subcommittee Chairman Harold Rogers, R-Ky., and others said  
House GOP leaders had decided to declare the census an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers said in an interview that the idea was justified because  
of a recent Supreme Court decision requiring the Census Bureau to 
use both a door-to-door count and computer-assisted statistical 
sampling, adding costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall spending bill falls nearly $3 billion short of what  
Clinton has requested and is not likely to become law until budget 
talks expected this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	It would cut his requests for hiring police officers, legal aid  
to the poor, U.S. contributions to international organizations and 
helping salmon populations in the Northwest recover. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Senate used a voice vote to approve its $35.3  
billion version of the bill. White House officials have already 
threatened a veto because it contains cuts similar to the House's. 
</P>
<P>
	By voice vote, the Senate agreed to provide $496 million of  
Clinton's $1.3 billion proposal for helping communities hire police 
officers. Senators also used a voice vote to add provisions 
expanding federal jurisdiction over hate crimes to cover victims 
chosen because of their sexual orientation, gender or disability. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate measure would provide $3 billion for the census, none  
of it paid for with the surplus.

<HEADLINE> Gore in Environmental Quandary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORNISH, N.H. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore urged Americans to  
protect the nation's environment for future generations, but a 
state official who accompanied him complained about special 
treatment after four billion gallons of water was released into the 
Connecticut River to ensure that his canoe would not run aground 
during a photo opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spoke about the environment after the presidential  
candidate went canoeing today with a fellow Democrat, New Hampshire 
Gov. Jeanne Shaheen. 
</P>
<P>
	Local utility officials said they were asked by the Secret  
Service and the Connecticut River Joint Commission to release water 
from a dam to raise the level of the river, according to a story in 
Friday's editions of The Washington Times. 
</P>
<P>
	``They won't release the water for the fish when we ask them to,  
but somehow they find themselves able to release it for a 
politician,'' complained John Kassel, director of the Vermont 
Department of Natural Resources, who accompanied Gore on the trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only reason they did this was to make sure the vice  
president's canoe didn't get stuck,'' the Times quoted Kassel as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said no one on the campaign staff  
asked for the water to be released. 
</P>
<P>
	The river, as one of 14 designated an American Heritage River,  
qualifies for special federal money. Gore announced that $819,000 
had been earmarked for various projects related to the river. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also took the opportunity to discuss his own memories of  
growing up by waterways in Tennessee. Those early experiences and 
later ones with his own children led him to urge President Clinton 
to adopt the American Heritage Rivers Initiative, he said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore stressed that environmentalism and economic prosperity are  
intertwined. 
</P>
<P>
	``Environmental protection and economic growth are not opposing  
forces, but go hand in hand,'' he said. ``We have to make the 21st 
century the time we right the environmental wrongs of the past.''

<HEADLINE> Alvarez's Son Pleads Innocent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Wisconsin football coach Barry Alvarez's  
son had innocent pleas entered on his behalf today to charges in 
the microwave death of a fraternity brother's pet bird. 
</P>
<P>
	Chad Alvarez is charged with felony theft and intentional  
mistreatment of an animal resulting in death. 
</P>
<P>
	Alvarez was accompanied by his parents as he walked into the  
courtroom this morning. His attorney, Steven Hurley, entered the 
pleas before Dane County Circuit Judge William Foust. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said a date for a jury trial would be set.  
</P>
<P>
	Alvarez waived his right to a preliminary hearing on accusations  
he killed Iago the parrot by microwaving it at the Sigma Chi 
fraternity house. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted on the theft charge, he faces a maximum fine of  
$10,000 and a jail sentence of up to five years. On the other 
charge, he faces a maximum fine up to $10,000 and a jail sentence 
of up to two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Cory Greenfield owned the parrot and said whoever killed it may  
have done so because he was angry about an e-mail that was passed 
around the fraternity house. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, a former  
chancellor at UW, is among those who have asked a judge to show 
leniency in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Shalala's letter is among more than 100 filed with the court on  
behalf of Alvarez.

<HEADLINE> 2nd Group Cancels Over S.C. Flag </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- The National Urban League has become the  
second group this week to cancel a convention in Charleston to 
protest lawmakers' refusal to remove the Confederate battle flag 
from the Capitol dome. 
</P>
<P>
	Milton Little, the league's executive vice president and chief  
operating officer, said Thursday that executives will select 
another site for next spring's regional convention. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, four days before it was to convene, the Southern  
Christian Leadership Conference canceled a 2,500-member convention 
in Charleston in protest over the flag. The African Methodist 
Episcopal Churches also has said it will relocate its statewide 
youth conference scheduled for next year in Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  
voted earlier this month, at the urging of its South Carolina 
chapter, to boycott the state for flying the banner. 
</P>
<P>
	The Urban League conference would have attracted league members  
from 11 Southern states, said Maxine Martin, executive director of 
the Charleston Urban League. 
</P>
<P>
	Little said the withdrawal was a way to punish the state  
economically. 
</P>
<P>
	Because South Carolina flies the Confederate flag, it raises  
concerns about the state's willingness to provide equal access for 
economic opportunity, Little said. Economic empowerment for its 
members is one of the missions of the Urban League. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jim Hodges has said he supports bringing the flag down but  
will not push the issue. Former Gov. David Beasley encountered 
heavy opposition when he proposed removing the flag.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks, Dollar Down / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks closed down today following an  
overnight fall on Wall Street and amid a further decline by the 
dollar vs. the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 195.90 points,  
or 1.10 percent, to close at 17,534.44. On Thursday, the average 
closed down 527.18 points, or 2.89 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 116.74 yen in late afternoon trading today,  
down 1.70 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo but slightly above its 
late New York level of 116.70 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	In stock trading, traders said shares fell following a selloff  
in New York on the previous day. Wall Street stocks fell on 
Thursday after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan 
criticized what he called ``euphoria'' in stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese exporters with large overseas sales faced heavy  
selling. Sony fell $1.28 to $117.35, Fujitsu fell 60 cents to 
$24.16, and Toyota slipped 69 cents to $32.55. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section closed down 22.53 points, or 1.54 percent, to finish 
at 1,436.49. The TOPIX closed down 41.09 points, or 2.79 percent, 
the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, Thursday's decline in demand for U.S.  
stocks sent the dollar lower against the yen in Tokyo today. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa  
hinted today that Japanese financial authorities are still prepared 
to intervene to stem the yen's rapid rise against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	But many investors brushed that possibility off.  
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan failed to intervene in currency markets today,  
adding to speculation that the central bank may have temporarily 
given up on efforts to prop up the U.S. currency against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	With Japan refraining from intervention, the dollar fell as low  
as 116.05 yen on Thursday, its lowest level in five months. 
</P>
<P>
	Gains by the yen make Japanese exports more costly abroad, and  
thus less competitive, while reducing the value of foreign revenue 
in yen terms. Japan is struggling to emerge from its worst 
recession in more than 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro traded at 122.64 yen in the late  
afternoon today, down from 124.06 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.7000 percent from the previous day's close of 1.7350 
percent, pushing the price up to 100.86 yen from the previous day's 
100.55 yen.

<HEADLINE> Brewers Release Jim Abbott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Jim Abbott, who amazed and inspired baseball  
fans by reaching the major leagues despite having only one hand, 
has been released by the Milwaukee Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Jon Greenberg, the Brewers' director of media relations, said he  
did not know whether that meant the 31-year-old Abbott would be 
retiring from baseball. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported 
today there is a strong chance Abbott has thrown his last pitch in 
the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's up to him,'' Greenberg said.  
</P>
<P>
	Amid speculation about the move, Abbott left Milwaukee County  
Stadium without commenting to reporters Thursday after the team 
beat the Philadelphia Phillies 5-0 and prepared for a road trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott's telephone numbers in Milwaukee and Harbor Springs,  
Mich., are unpublished. His agent, Scott Boras, did not immediately 
return calls this morning seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad to see him go,'' infielder Mark Loretta said. ``There  
are a lot of guys that you play with that you say you will keep in 
touch with, but you never do. He is one of those guys that you will 
stay in touch with. I know I will. It was great playing with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenberg said right-handed reliever Reggie Harris (2-2) would  
join the Brewers from their Class AAA Louisville farm club to 
replace Abbott on the roster. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott (2-8) gave up three runs in the ninth inning of a 7-0  
loss to Philadelphia on Wednesday, the most recent poor outing of a 
disappointing season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gave it his best shot,'' Loretta said.  
</P>
<P>
	Abbott, born without a right hand, was on the United States team  
that won the baseball tournament at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
	After four seasons with the California Angels, he was traded to  
the New York Yankees and pitched a no-hitter against Cleveland on 
Sept. 4, 1993, at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a thrill of a lifetime,'' Abbott recalled Sunday, the  
day David Cone threw a perfect game for the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott opened the 1995 season with the Chicago White Sox and  
later was traded back to the Angels. He posted a 2-18 record during 
the 1996 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Angels released him after a series of shaky starts in spring  
training in 1997. Abbott spent the summer at his Michigan home. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, he signed a minor league deal with the White Sox and  
worked his way through the farm system until reaching the majors, 
where he was 5-0 in the final month of that season. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott signed with the Brewers as a free agent Jan. 27, 1999. He  
had an impressive spring training and began the season as the No. 4 
starter in the Brewers' rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	He also got his first major league hit on June 15 against the  
Chicago Cubs. He spent most of his career in the American League, 
where pitchers don't normally bat. 
</P>
<P>
	After giving up 18 runs in his first three starts, Abbott spent  
the rest of the season bouncing between starting and relieving. 
</P>
<P>
	It was after he allowed five runs in 3 2-3 innings in front of  
friends and family on July 8 at Tiger Stadium, that Abbott said he 
would contemplate his future after the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
	When he came back after the break, he was assigned to the  
bullpen.

<HEADLINE> Faulk Holdout Officially Underway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MACOMB, Ill. (AP) -- The Marshall Faulk holdout has officially  
begun. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis Rams running back was the lone no-show Friday as  
the team held its first two practices in 102-degree heat at Western 
Illinois University. Rams coach Dick Vermeil said it was no big 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not an issue, it really isn't,'' Vermeil said. ``When  
Marshall gets here, we'll start talking about him. The longer he's 
not here, the more it hurts him and the more it hurts the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vermeil said the Rams' contract negotiator, vice president Jay  
Zygmunt, was traveling Friday. Faulk's agent, Rocky Arceneaux of 
St. Louis, did not return a telephone call from The Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The team made it through the first two workouts without mishap  
despite the heat. So far, so good for Vermeil, who is trying to end 
a string of nine consecutive losing seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Vermeil's top priority in camp is revitalizing an offense that  
ranked 27th in the NFL last year. He has a new offensive 
coordinator, Mike Martz, formerly with the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got a ton of offense in through the minicamps and the  
offseason program,'' Vermeil said. ``We threw it at them last 
night. For them to come out and get through it pretty clean was 
impressive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams added potential defensive help Friday, acquiring  
linebacker Mike Morton from the Green Bay Packers for future 
considerations. Morton, 27, could help the Rams while linebacker 
Leonard Little serves an eight-game suspension for violating the 
NFL's substance abuse policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Little pleaded guilty last month to involuntary manslaughter in  
a fatal auto accident in which he was drunk and ran a red light. He 
can practice with the team and play in exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
	The 235-pound Morton signed with Green Bay in the spring as a  
free agent from the Oakland Raiders. He played four seasons in 
Oakland, starting 17 games and playing in 55. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year he played primarily on special teams, making 13  
tackles. He was coached in Oakland by Frank Gansz Jr., son of the 
Rams special teams coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's available for very little,'' Vermeil said. ``We can take  
a look at him and if it doesn't fit, then it doesn't cost us 
anything.''

<HEADLINE> Six Japanese Bankers Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Six former executives of a failed major Japanese  
bank were arrested Friday on suspicion of covering up more than 
$830 million in losses, state-run television reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation may spread to the Ministry of Finance, which  
allegedly knew the bank was in trouble but took no steps out of 
fear of provoking the bank's collapse, NHK television said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office and the Tokyo  
police arrested former Nippon Credit Bank Ltd. Chairman Hiroshi 
Kubota, former President Shigeoki Togo, former Vice President Tadao 
Iwaki and three others, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	A month ago prosecutors arrested three former top executives of  
another failed lender, the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	Both banks were taken over by the government late last year  
after regulators determined that they were insolvent. 
</P>
<P>
	Nippon and Long-Term, two of Japan's three credit banks, enjoyed  
enormous prestige as they financed the country's rapid economic 
rise from the ashes of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a decade ago they were among the largest banks in the  
world. But changes in corporate finance forced them to seek new 
borrowers, including questionable real estate developers. Many of 
those developers defaulted with Japan's property market collapse in 
the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's arrests were prompted by a complaint filed by Nippon's  
current state-appointed management, which alleged that Kubota, 68, 
ordered $830 million in unrecoverable loans be classified as 
recoverable in a March 1998 earnings statement to investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank's liabilities currently exceed its assets by $790  
million, regulators said.

<HEADLINE> Dierker's Lineup Card a Surprise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Houston manager Larry Dierker had a surprise  
lineup Friday night against San Diego: Jose Lima at third base and 
Scott Elarton in center field. 
</P>
<P>
	The pitchers never actually made it onto the field for the  
completion of the game suspended when manager Larry Dierker 
collapsed in the dugout on June 13. 
</P>
<P>
	But they were listed on the lineup card in place of two players  
on the disabled list who had been in the game when Dierker took 
ill: third baseman Ricky Gutierrez and center fielder Carl Everett. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole thing seemed weird,'' Dierker said. ``There were a  
lot of variables for the rest of the game, depending on what 
happened when we batted in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first I wanted to leave the players blank to replace  
Gutierrez and Everett but the umpires told me I had to put names in 
their place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Darryl Ward pinch hit for Elarton, who was hitting in the sixth  
position, when the game resumed in the bottom of the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	When the ninth started, Dierker then replaced Lima with Glen  
Barker, and Billy Wagner came on to pitch, replacing Ward in the 
lineup. Third baseman Russ Johnson went into the No. 9 spot in the 
order, which had been pitcher Shane Reynolds when the game was 
suspended. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was designed to provide Dierker with more pinch-hitting  
options and to prevent San Diego manager Bruce Bochy from guessing 
the eventual batting order. Houston, which led 4-1 when the game 
was suspended, held on for a 4-3 win. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think anything about it,'' Bochy said. ``I knew those  
guys weren't going to play. I guess if he wanted to use a certain 
hitter it might be a strategy.''

<HEADLINE> Lewis-Holyfield Talks Make Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Progress is being made toward an undisputed  
heavyweight championship rematch between Evander Holyfield and 
Lennox Lewis, but negotiations have not reached the contract stage. 
</P>
<P>
	``This week we came to agreement with all major issues between  
HBO and (promoter Don) King, but it's a handshake agreement,'' Lou 
DiBella, senior vice president of HBO Sports, said Friday. ``There 
is no contract, and none has been drafted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the fight is made, it will be held Nov. 13, apparently in the  
Thomas &AMP; Mack Center at Las Vegas. Their March 13 fight in Madison 
Square Garden ended in a highly controversial draw, with most 
observers feeling Lewis won. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's happened is a natural progression of completing a  
deal,'' DiBella said. ``Now King has to work out issues with Lewis' 
promoter and then we have to get a contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	HBO is guaranteeing the purse of WBC champion Lewis, with whom  
it has a multiple-fight deal. King is supposed to pay WBA-IBF 
champion Holyfield and the undercard fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis and Holyfield each is guaranteed $15 million.  
</P>
<P>
	In March, Holyfield was guaranteed $20 million, and Lewis was  
guaranteed $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't foresee a problem to getting a contract once the  
principal points are agreed upon,'' Jim Thomas, Holfyield's 
attorney, said by telephone from Atlanta. ``This (the oral 
agreement) leaves some points that need to be resolved between 
Panos and King. 
</P>
<P>
	There remain some financial arrangement to be worked out between  
Panos Eliades, Lewis' main promoter, and Main Events, the American 
promoter of the champion from Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	Eliades has said that contracts would have to be signed by the  
end of July if a pay-per-view fight was to be put together for Nov. 
13.

<HEADLINE> Encarnacion Injured on Wet Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Detroit outfielder Juan Encarnacion was injured  
on the third play of the first inning of the Tigers' rain-delayed 
game with the Boston Red Sox and had to be carried from the field 
on a motorized cart Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The field was soaked by a heavy thunderstorm that swept through  
Detroit in the late afternoon. The storm, which delayed the start 
of the game by 47 minutes, also tore some panels off the facing of 
the press box at Tiger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Encarnacion appeared to injure his right ankle while running  
from his position in left field toward the Detroit bullpen in 
pursuit of a pop foul by Brian Daubach, the third Boston batter. 
</P>
<P>
	He lost his footing in the water-soaked grass and began to skid  
toward the practice mound. As third baseman Jason Wood hauled in 
the ball for the second out, Encarnacion's skid took him to the 
hard dirt edge of the bullpen mound, where he tumbled forward and 
collapsed. A dark skid mark, about six feet long, was visible in 
the grass. 
</P>
<P>
	Team trainers tried first to help Encarnacion limp off the  
field, then signaled for the cart. Karim Garcia replaced 
Encarnacion in left.

<HEADLINE> Hill Fastest in Austria GP Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPIELBERG, Austria (AP) -- Damon Hill, the former Formula One  
champion who nearly quit racing two weeks ago, set the fastest time 
in Friday's free practice for the Austrian Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill drove his Jordan around the 2.683-mile A1-Ring course in  
one minute, 13.303 seconds in the final lap of the afternoon 
practice session. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was fun!,'' Hill said. ``I enjoyed myself and I'm  
delighted to finish the day in first place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even team chief Eddie Jordan appeared incredulous as Hill beat  
reigning champion Mika Hakkinen of Finland. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill spun out a total of five times in the two sessions. ``I  
wondered whether I should be taking up a new career as a rally 
driver. We had not found the right set-up, but obviously we fixed 
it by the end of the session.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hakkinen, winner of three races this season and leader in the  
drivers' standings, edged McLaren-Mercedes teammate David Coulthard 
of Britain to set the second fastest time, .022 seconds behind 
Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Coulthard, winner of the British Grand Prix two weeks ago, was  
.072 seconds further behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill, a 38-year-old Briton, had threatened to quit after engine  
trouble forced him to retire from last month's French Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
	Winner of the 1996 Formula One championship, Hill crashed out of  
four races this season and had indicated that the British GP would 
be his last race, citing poor form and lack of enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
	But a fifth-place finish at the British race convinced him to  
continue racing until the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The two Ferraris lagged behind in practice, which usually has  
little bearing on the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Irvine of Britain was ninth, while Mika Salo of Finland  
ended up 16th in his debut for Ferrari, after spinning off the 
track and missing a good part of the afternoon session. 
</P>
<P>
	Salo was hired to replace two-time champion Michael Schumacher,  
who broke his right leg in a high-speed crash at Silverstone. 
Schumacher is not expected to return until late in the season -- if 
at all this year. 
</P>
<P>
	With Schumacher out of contention, Irvine is now Hakkinen's  
closest challenger. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm eight points behind at halfway point of the season and  
it's not going to be easy. But there won't be any lack of trying on 
my part,'' Irvine said. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility of showers is forecast for Saturday's qualifying  
and Sunday's race.

stolen from an armored car company's loading dock.

<P>
	The cloth bags were taken July 13, but the theft was not

<HEADLINE> NATO, Russia Urge Serbs To Stay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- NATO and Russia renewed their  
cooperation today in the aftermath of the Kosovo crisis that 
divided them, jointly urging Serbs not to flee the 
Albanian-dominated province. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting of NATO ambassadors and Russian diplomats who sit on  
the Permanent Joint Council had been set for Tuesday, but was 
delayed until the agenda could be clarified and a joint statement 
drafted. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian news agency Itar-Tass said the talks today were  
limited to Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia froze relations with NATO after the alliance bombed  
Yugoslavia for 11 weeks, ignoring Russian protests. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told British TV on Thursday  
that if NATO wants to restore relations, it has to build them on 
trust and avoid unilateral actions such as the bombing of 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Russia and the West have to determine how to avoid such  
unexpected developments in the future when one of the parties takes 
steps which seriously aggravate the situation in Europe and the 
world,'' Ivanov said. 
</P>
<P>
	He stressed that cooperation is possible.  
</P>
<P>
	``I believe we are ready for such serious talks. If NATO shows a  
similar decisiveness, we shall agree to a further development of 
relations with the alliance,'' Ivanov said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Permanent Joint Council was set up to include Moscow on  
European security matters. The council said in statement today that 
``NATO and Russia are determined to do their utmost to ensure equal 
security for all inhabitants of Kosovo, regardless of their ethnic, 
political or religious affiliations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many in the minority Serb community are fleeing ethnic Albanians  
seeking vengeance for Serb violence in the province. 
</P>
<P>
	In the council's statement, Russia and NATO expressed their  
``growing concern at the continuing departure of significant 
numbers of Serbs and members of other ethnic groups from Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They urge all Serbs and members of other ethnic groups to stay  
in Kosovo, and those who have left to return to their homes,'' the 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Friction over the Russian role in the Kosovo peacekeeping  
operation led to problems last month, when Russian paratroopers 
stationed in Bosnia suddenly thrust into Kosovo to seize the 
airport at Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	The move caught NATO by surprise, but it was willing to work  
with the Russian peacekeepers until they tried to expand their 
patrol zone into the sector of Kosovo controlled by Italian forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia helped broker the peace deal between NATO and Yugoslavia  
and had sought its own sector of influence within Kosovo. NATO 
officials feared that would lead to partition of the Serb province 
between ethnic Albanians and Serbs.

<HEADLINE> Kennedy's Ashes Cast Into Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FALMOUTH, Mass. (AP) -- Children tossed wildflowers as the  
Kennedy and Bessette families drove past hundreds of well-wishers 
on their way to the Coast Guard station on the Vineyard Sound. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our prayers are with you all,'' read a sign held by Glen  
Rogers of Falmouth, who brought his two children to watch the 
motorcade pass. 
</P>
<P>
	Cape Cod vacationers and residents came no closer to the  
ceremony that returned the ashes of John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife, 
Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister, Lauren Bessette, to the 
seas near where they died. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sun was out, it was a beautiful day,'' said the Rev. Louis  
Iasiello, who assisted in Thursday's service aboard the USS 
Briscoe. ``Everything was very quiet and tranquil and peaceful. ... 
It added to the solemnity of the moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A brass quintet played the Navy hymn ``Eternal Father'' as the  
ashes were committed about two miles from where Kennedy's plane 
crashed a week ago today. Six clergy members took turns reading 
scriptures and prayers at a podium at the rear of the ship, while 
300 members of the destroyer crew stood silently behind mourners. 
</P>
<P>
	A flag was lowered to half-mast as about 15 mourners, some  
wearing black and flanked by the sailors in dress whites, gathered 
on the stern. The dead were returned to the sea along with three 
wreaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Planes were ordered to keep five miles away, while boats were  
allowed no closer than a mile. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy's sister, Caroline, and mother-in-law, Ann Freeman, led  
the service, which was officiated by the Rev. Charles O'Byrne. Sen. 
Edward Kennedy and JFK Jr.'s cousins William Kennedy Smith and 
Maria Shriver were also there. 
</P>
<P>
	A Navy honor guard fired a rifle volley for the two women and  
the young man who at age 3 saluted the casket of his assassinated 
father, President John F. Kennedy. Flags were presented to the 
families. 
</P>
<P>
	The Roman Catholic Church allows cremation, though burial is the  
preferred practice. U.S. bishops forbid the scattering of ashes at 
sea; an urn containing the full set of remains must be placed into 
the water. 
</P>
<P>
	Iasiello would not say what practice was followed for Kennedy,  
38, his 33-year-old wife and her 34-year-old sister. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony, held the morning after the bodies were brought up  
from the ocean floor, provided a quick ending to the six-day 
national vigil that began when Kennedy's single-engine Piper 
Saratoga dropped from radar 16 1/2 miles from Martha's Vineyard 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation continues into the cause of the crash. The  
medical examiner determined all three died instantly. 
</P>
<P>
	On Gay Head Beach, overlooking the spot where the wreckage was  
found near Martha's Vineyard, residents erected a 4-foot cross made 
of driftwood and lashed together with wild grapevines. The names 
John-John, Carolyn and Lauren were etched into each arm of the 
cross.

<HEADLINE> Award-Winning Author Dead At 73 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAUSALITO, Calif. (AP) -- Gina Berriault, an acclaimed yet  
unheralded writer who won the National Book Critics Circle Award 
and PEN/Faulkner Prize in 1997, died after a brief illness. She was 
73. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Berriault died July 15 in this small tourist town just north  
of San Francisco. She won the awards two years ago for her 
collection of short stories, ``Women in their Beds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I never felt I accomplished all that much, writing here on the  
edge of the continent,'' she said after winning the Faulkner Prize. 
``But I had to. I had to write. All my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She wrote seven books in all, and numerous short stories, one of  
which, ``The Stone Boy,'' was made into a 1984 film starring Robert 
Duvall and Glenn Close. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Berriault also was honored with a Guggenheim Fellowship, a  
grant from the National Endowment for the Arts and two Commonwealth 
Medals for Literature. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite critical acclaim, Ms. Berriault never won the fame that  
many thought she deserved. Critic Andre Dubus said she was ``a 
splendid but unheralded writer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berriault earned enough to raise a daughter by herself and to  
work on stories that magazines often turned down. When her books 
were published, they quickly went out of print. ``Women in their 
Beds'' sold just 30,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
	``To find another writer of such emotional depth and range, one  
thinks of Babel or Tolstoy, Hawthorne or Henry James,'' said her 
editor, Jack Shoemaker at Counterpoint Press, an imprint no more 
famous than Berriault. ``No praise can ever quite measure her 
accomplishments in the short story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Who Is It Can Tell Me Who I Am?'', the title lifted from  
``King Lear,'' a librarian encounters a homeless man and ends up 
questioning his own life. ``Anna Lisa's Nose'' tells of a woman who 
thinks she can change her fate by changing her nose, only to 
discover she has become a stranger to everyone, especially herself. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Berriault was born Arline Shandling in Long Beach, Calif.,  
of immigrant parents from Eastern Europe. Her father, a writer and 
editor of trade publications, encouraged her interest in writing. 
</P>
<P>
	She moved north in the 1950s, settling in Marin County.  
</P>
<P>
	By 1960, one of her short stories was included in the O. Henry  
collection. In 1961, her first novel, ``The Descent,'' was 
published, followed by ``A Conference of Victims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other novels include ``The Son'' and ``The Lights of Earth.''  
Short story collections include ``The Mistress'' and ``The Infinite 
Passion of Expectation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1997 interview with The Associated Press, she described her  
first attempt at writing a story on her own. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw these two sisters on the beach, singing to themselves,  
and I remember their hands were covered with brown spots, big brown 
spots and I described that. They were pale and they might have been 
freckled. They had long, gray hair and they were just sitting there 
like that at the beach, singing,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sent it to Harper's (Bazaar). They asked me to change it:  
this way, that way. I did and they still sent it back and I think I 
cried for the rest of the afternoon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She loved Chekhov and other Russian writers, despised television  
and thought statistics, age included, were the enemy of compassion. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Berriault is survived by her daughter, Julie, and longtime  
companion Leonard Gardner, a writer.

<HEADLINE> Cone Gives Up a hit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- David Cone dashed any thoughts of another  
perfect game with only one batter Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees ace walked Cleveland leadoff man Kenny  
Lofton on five pitches in the top of the first. Cone allowed his 
first hit when Richie Sexson opened the second with a clean single 
to left field. 
</P>
<P>
	Cone pitched the 14th perfect game in modern history, the 16th  
overall, in his last start Sunday at home against Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	A sellout crowd gave Cone a standing ovation as he walked from  
the bullpen to the dugout before the start of the matchup between 
AL division leaders. The Indians, with the best record in baseball, 
led the majors in batting at .293. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 17, 1998, David Wells pitched a perfect game against  
Minnesota at Yankee Stadium. In his next start, he retired the 
first Boston batter before giving up a pop-fly single to Darren 
Bragg that shortstop Derek Jeter lost in the sun. Wells wound up 
winning, 12-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnny Vander Meer is the only major league pitcher to throw  
consecutive no-hitters, doing it in 1938 for Cincinnati.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Beat U.S. in Admiral's Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COWES, Isle of Wight (AP) -- American Dee Smith contributed to  
the defeat of the United States team, helping the Netherlands win 
the Admiral's Cup for the first time Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Netherlands won the unofficial world championship of  
offshore sailing after the eight-race regatta, followed by Europe 
and Britain with the defending champion U.S. fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, a member of the U.S. team which won the Admiral's Cup in  
1997, switched to the Dutch team this year as tactician on big boat 
``Innovision 7''. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got no problem winning it again with the Netherlands --  
I'm a professional yachtsman and all I did was my job,'' Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was talk of me sailing with the U.S. crew in this year's  
Admiral's Cup to defend the trophy ... but in the end the offer I 
got from the Dutch team was more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was offered the chance to have more say in what went on and  
a more interesting part to play. It's great to have played a part 
in a successful Admiral's Cup team again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a gallant finish by American big boat Idler, the  
three-yacht team didn't do enough in the 388 mile Wolf Rock Race to 
overhaul the leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Idler, skippered by Ken Read and containing six America's Cup  
sailors in its crew, surrendered a one-hour lead overnight to 
finish third behind Europe's Brava Q8 and Britain's Venture 99. 
</P>
<P>
	Read, whose team finished 31 points behind the Dutch, said he  
was disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came here to retain the Admiral's Cup and we've failed  
which doesn't feel too good,'' he said. ``But we can take a lot 
from the way we've sailed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to wait 28 years to win the Admiral's Cup back in 1997  
and I will be back in two years time to make sure we don't have to 
wait another 28 years to win it again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Benjamin's Sydney 40 yacht Blue Yankee Pride finished the  
Wolf Rock Race in fourth place to end a disappointing regatta for 
the 40-footer. Germany's MK Cafe won the class. 
</P>
<P>
	``We needed more time on the boat -- it's as simple as that. We  
had good speed but there was a lot of competition out there from 
some of the best crews in the world,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Mumm 36 class, Chris Larson's Ciao Baby finished fifth,  
well behind race winner Mean Machine of the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did well in the inshore races but we struggled in the  
offshore races,'' Larson said.

<HEADLINE> Woodstock '99 Draws Thousands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME, N.Y. (AP) -- More than 200,000 music fans streamed into  
town Friday for Woodstock '99, a three-day celebration of love and 
peace held at a former military base instead of the farm where the 
original antiwar festival took place 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	James Brown opened the show, introduced as the ``general of  
soul'' as he looked out on giant hangars that used to house B-52 
bombers. Also on the weekend bill were Limp Bizkit, Dave Matthews 
Band, Korn, Jewel and Sheryl Crow. 
</P>
<P>
	While original Woodstock announcer Wavy Gravy returned to urge  
fans to take care of each other, he was surrounded by reminders 
that it was a long way from 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	Skateboarders sailed up ramps in an ``extreme sports'' park,  
vendors sold hemp tacos and people complained that cell phone 
transmission lines were jammed. 
</P>
<P>
	By midday, the crowd was estimated at 220,000. Promoters planned  
for 250,000 but said they would keep selling tickets as long as 
people wanted to get in. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's 1999, the turn of the century, and this is going to be  
the biggest party of the century,'' said Shawn Hagen, who drove 27 
hours with four friends from Monticello, Minn., to attend the 
concert. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities reported few problems, but first aid workers were  
kept busy treating several hundred people woozy from the 90-degree 
heat. One woman was in labor in a first aid tent. Concert promoters 
scrambled to find space with a 245-acre campground overflowing even 
before the music started. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown belted out ``Cold Sweat,'' but that was wishful thinking  
for his audience. Fans poured bottled water over each others' heads 
and crowded a ``rain tent,'' where they were drenched with a fine 
mist, if they could get in. 
</P>
<P>
	``We walked by it,'' said Heather Garland, 25, of Bloomfield,  
N.J. ``There were too many sweaty bodies in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Few fans were complaining, though. Candace Redden, 28, drove  
nearly two days from Canada with two friends, leaving their van in 
Maine when it broke down and renting a car. 
</P>
<P>
	``We come from Nova Scotia and not a lot of bands get up  
there,'' Ms. Redden said. ``This is an opportunity to see it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police reported three arrests, two for minor offenses and one  
for speeding and driving while intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
	One fan was sent on his way when he entered a state police  
cruiser, thinking it was a taxi, and asked to be taken to a stage. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was just confused,'' said New York State police Maj. James  
Parmley.

<HEADLINE> Bush Warns GOP Rivals on Mudslinging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOHNSTON, Iowa (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush warned rivals  
for the Republican presidential nomination today that those who 
attack him will pay a price because voters are weary of 
mudslinging. 
</P>
<P>
	Since launching his exploration of a bid for the GOP nomination,  
Bush has outdistanced other candidates in fund-raising and in early 
public opinion polls. That puts him in a position to draw fire from 
the other campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure I will be the target,'' he said. ``There is a danger  
in the year 2000 of running a negative campaign. People are sick of 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While his campaign has made raising money difficult for his GOP  
rivals, some strategists worry about attacks from publisher Steve 
Forbes, who is using his own fortune to finance his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1996 presidential primary season, Forbes assaulted  
frontrunner Bob Dole relentlessly and left him damaged in the 
general election. Bush said he has no indication Forbes is about to 
do so again, and insisted his views on negative campaigning weren't 
linked to a specific candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush spoke during a taping of Iowa Public Television's ``Iowa  
Press'' program and during a later meeting with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he would seek to broaden the GOP's base,  
particularly among Hispanic voters turned off by hard-line 
Republican positions on immigration. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to have a message that the Republican Party cares  
about people who live in decaying cities, who live on the outskirts 
of poverty,'' said Bush. ``Our philosophy is one that is uplifting 
and hopeful and we better have someone who can say that to the 
American people loud and clear or otherwise we're not going to win 
in 2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That message doesn't sell well with some in the GOP.  
Conservatives, including presidential candidate Pat Buchanan, 
hammer at illegal immigration, and argue against expanded trade 
agreements.

<HEADLINE> Natives Protest Pan Am Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Native Canadian marchers paraded to  
the opening ceremonies of the Pan American Games on Friday to 
protest what they say are third-world conditions for their people 
in Manitoba. 
</P>
<P>
	A few hours earlier, southern Manitoba First Nation, a group of  
Canadian aboriginals, opened a casino in defiance of provincial 
law, saying the casino will help improve those deplorable living 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Native leaders say casinos like those operated by bands in other  
provinces and the United States are an important first step in 
providing the financial wherewithal to pay for native 
self-government. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps 200 marchers, including native drummers, were on hand  
for the start of the walk, although more were expected to join en 
route. The protesters promised to remain outside Winnipeg Stadium 
and not disrupt the official opening of the games being attended by 
Princess Anne and other dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not the intention of this demonstration at all, we are  
not protesting the Pan Am Games,'' said organizer Gerald McIvor. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said he doesn't want an estimated 100,000 games visitors  
to leave Manitoba thinking there are no problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``My people are living in third world conditions in the country  
that's been voted No. 1 again in the world as the best country in 
the world to live in,'' McIvor said. 
</P>
<P>
	And he said that's ironic because Canada is such a staunch  
defender of human rights elsewhere on the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're projecting an international image that is not real,''  
said McIvor. 
</P>
<P>
	Premier Gary Filmon warned any protests disrupting the  
festivities would bring no public sympathy. But McIvor and Terry 
Nelson, another native leader, said it was never their intention to 
ruin the party. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, they said as aboriginal residents of Manitoba  
they really have little to lose. 
</P>
<P>
	``We make up a minimum of 61 percent of the inmates in prison  
and one out of three native children that are born today will spend 
some lengthy time in jail,'' said Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
	``A native woman here in Manitoba is 131 times more likely to go  
to jail than a white woman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The native Canadians also have written to Prime Minister Jean  
Chretien asking him to end a housing crisis. They say there is an 
immediate need for 4,500 new houses on northern reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	Poverty and inequities in the justice system are two of the main  
issues the protest is trying to highlight, McIvor said.

<HEADLINE> Phone Maker Ericsson's Profit Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Telecommunications equipment maker LM  
Ericsson AB's profit fell 38 percent in the first half and the 
company expanded by 4,000 the number of jobs it plans to eliminate 
by the end of next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The company blamed its earnings decline on rising sales costs  
and increased investment on research, development and 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Friday, it said its full-year profit would be  
below that of 1998 but it expects an upswing in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Ericsson also disclosed it has raised to 15,000 the number of  
jobs it plans to eliminate by the end of next year. In January, 
Ericsson announced planned cuts of 11,000 jobs by the end of the 
year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The reduction will take place through a combination of layoffs,  
outsourcing and selloffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid hopes that the worst news is behind it, Ericsson's U.S.  
shares shot up almost 15 percent Friday, rising $4.06 1/4 to $31.68 3/4 
on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Ericsson earned 3.19 billion kronor, or $379 million, in the  
first half, down from 5.19 billion kronor a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The profit decline came despite growing sales. Net sales for the  
period were 92.38 billion kronor, or $10.9 billion, up 12 percent 
from 82.25 billion kronor in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	In the consumer products division that includes the cellular  
telephones for which Ericsson is most widely known, sales were down 
8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But the company recorded a 22 percent increase in its larger  
networks operator and service providers division. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Ericsson ended a long patent dispute with Qualcomm of  
the United States over the CDMA cellular phone system used in the 
U.S. Ericsson is now well-positioned as a supplier of CDMA phones 
and of the GSM system used in Europe, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings report comes just two weeks after a shakeup in  
Ericsson's top management, when chief executive officer and 
president Sven-Christer Nilsson resigned and that job was split 
among two other Ericsson veterans. Lars Ramqvist, chairman of the 
board, was named CEO; Kurt Hellstroem, executive vice 
president-Asia Pacific, was named president. 
</P>
<P>
	The new management's primary ambition is ``a fast improvement of  
the operational performance of the company. The immediate focus 
will be to secure a faster implementation of the restructuring 
program and to complete the transition to the new organization,'' 
the company statement said.

<HEADLINE> Disney To Cut Time Waiting in Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Disneyland and Walt Disney World want to  
make sure they remain the happiest places on Earth for visitors who 
tend to get frustrated with long lines for rides. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting next week, visitors will be able to choose whether to  
wait in line at popular attractions or take a ticket that would 
guarantee them a spot in a shorter line as long as they return 
within an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	A display clock will tell visitors how long the wait is for each  
choice. 
</P>

	``The intent is to provide guests with more productive time in  
our parks,'' said Bruce Laval, an executive vice president at Walt 
Disney World in Orlando, Fla. ``There is nothing more unproductive 
than standing in line, and it is a big point of dissatisfaction 
with guests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Disney expects to extend the system over the next month to  
attractions at Magic Kingdom and Disney-MGM Studios parks in 
Orlando.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-Argentina Is for Olympic Hoops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- The only thing standing between the  
United States and an Olympic berth is Argentina, which happens to 
have a player brazen enough to dunk over Kevin Garnett and Tim 
Duncan. 
</P>
<P>
	That stuff by teen-ager Andres Nocioni in the first round of the  
Tournament of the Americas may have been the best by anyone in the 
entire Olympic qualifying event. 
</P>
<P>
	But Argentina's boasting ends there, and its outlook is bleak  
for Saturday's semifinal against the NBA stars. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're on a mission -- to go to Australia and play in the  
Olympics,'' Tim Hardaway said. ``We don't want to give anybody any 
ideas. We want to go out there and play with our minds and our 
bodies and show everybody that we are the best team in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two Olympic berths are at stake in Saturday's semifinals, with  
Puerto Rico playing Canada in the other game. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States had no problem with Argentina in the first  
round, winning by 31 in the Americans' third game. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has won its first eight games by an average of  
32.6 points and allowed no opponent to score more than 76. The only 
team that kept things tight into the second half was Brazil, which 
pulled within three points before the Americans pulled away. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our next game is the most important game that our team could  
ever have to play, to have to qualify with the way this is set 
up,'' coach Larry Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite winning the gold medal at the 1996 Olympics, the United  
States has to qualify for the 2000 Games because of its finish in 
the 1998 world championships. NBA players did not play there 
because of the league's lockout. Yugoslavia won and the United 
States finished third with CBA players. 
</P>
<P>
	In this tournament, Argentina, led by 3-point specialist Juan  
Espil, tied for second place with Canada and Puerto Rico. But the 
Argentines were seeded fourth for the semifinals under a 
complicated tiebreaker that used point differential as the 
determining factor. 
</P>
<P>
	One player undoubtedly looking forward to the Argentina-U.S.  
rematch is 19-year-old Nocioni. He drove baseline around Garnett 
and threw down an emphatic reverse slam over the outstretched arms 
of 7-footers Duncan and Garnett. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's between Kevin Garnett and that man,'' Hardaway said,  
drawing a laugh from Garnett. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still wish that kid the best,'' Garnett said Thursday. ``I  
hope he made makes the league off that and gets a whole bunch of 
endorsements, to tell you the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Canada-Puerto Rico game will be a rematch of what might have  
been the best game in the first two rounds -- Wednesday night's 
five-point victory by Puerto Rico in a game the host team needed to 
win by at least four points. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada's Steve Nash made a turnover late in that game,  
preventing Canada from getting off a decent attempt on its final 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll be hard for them to beat us twice,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Rico will be shooting for its second consecutive Olympic  
berth. Using many of the same players who are still on the team, 
Puerto Rico finished 10th -- ahead of only Angola and South Korea -- 
in the 12-team 1996 Olympic field. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans took the day off Friday, their first rest after  
playing eight games in eight nights. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans are staying in Rio Mar -- almost an hour outside  
San Juan -- and must make a long bus ride before and after every 
game. In addition, they played three consecutive games that started 
at 10 p.m. EDT during the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday night's 115-76 victory over Puerto Rico was a lift,  
coming before a raucous pro-Puerto Rican crowd of more than 12,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't wait until Saturday gets here so we can go out and do  
what we have to do,'' Gary Payton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S.-Argentina game will be played at 2 p.m. EDT, with the  
Puerto Rico-Canada game at 5:30 p.m. The winners meet in the gold 
medal game Sunday at 8 p.m.

<HEADLINE>  Baseball Hires 10 New Umps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Signaling that it's prepared to let squabbling  
umpires depart, baseball hired 10 minor league umps to take their 
place later this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Bud Selig and his top officials, in their first  
response to the umpires' mass resignations, decided Thursday to 
hire the Triple-A replacements, who had been working as vacation 
fill-ins. 
</P>
<P>
	They were notified they were being added to major league staffs  
on a permanent basis starting Sept. 1 -- the day before the 
resignations of the current umps take effect. 
</P>
<P>
	The bickering umpires have split into two camps -- those for and  
against union head Richie Phillips. The faction backing him is 
mostly in the National League. 
</P>
<P>
	Some are having a hard time deciding whether to follow Phillips.  
For example, American League ump Greg Kosc resigned, withdrew the 
resignation, then quit again. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, 33 of the 36 NL umpires plan to quit, according to a  
count by The Associated Press, but only about half of the AL's 32 
umpires plan to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires on each side have been pressuring their wavering  
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of this is all posturing, negotiating tactics,'' said AL  
ump Tim McClelland, who hasn't quit yet, but says he intends to. 
``You have to take it with a grain of salt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's decision to hire new umpires wasn't expected so soon.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's part of their strategy, but I don't know what their  
strategy is yet,'' Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, 51 major league umpires held a conference call  
Thursday to discuss their position, NL umpire Bruce Froemming said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's a lot more solidarity than there was two or  
three days ago,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, there were some umpires who think Phillips has to go.  
</P>
<P>
	``I am adamantly opposed to this kind of leadership,'' said the  
AL's Dave Phillips, who is no relation to the union head. ``There 
are times when you pull out your gun, your mortar and go 
winner-take-all. But communication and negotiation are the most 
important ingredients we need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richie Phillips said he has been opposed by an AL faction that  
existed since before the 1995 lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	``They do not like me personally, do not like my style and  
believe I'm too confrontational a lawyer,'' he said. ``The media is 
providing them with a forum. Fifty-five guys say Richie Phillips is 
the greatest thing that ever happened to officiating in any sport 
and has won battle after battle after battle for us since 1978.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to hire the new umpires came after virtually every  
top baseball official went to Milwaukee to meet with Selig, a group 
that included NL president Len Coleman, AL president Gene Budig, 
chief operating officer Paul Beeston, executive vice president 
Sandy Alderson and five lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Though baseball didn't announce the hirings, they were confirmed  
by Richie Phillips and several baseball officials. Selig declined 
comment, saying he would discuss the umpires at another time.

<HEADLINE> Some Criticize ``Practical Shooting'' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Assault rifles, semiautomatic handguns and  
shotguns don't always count as weapons in Nick Alexakos' 
vocabulary, especially when he's trying to get them into the 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexakos is president of the International Practical Shooting  
Confederation, and he rebuffs gun control advocates who say the 
high-intensity sport of practical shooting doesn't belong in the 
Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't deal with weapons,'' Alexakos said. ``We deal with  
recreational implements. A weapon is more how you use something 
than what it is. A baseball bat could be used a weapon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexakos, who has been lobbying the International Olympic  
Committee, was responding to a campaign launched Thursday by the 
Violence Policy Center. Philip Alpers, who researched the sport for 
the center, said there were political motives behind practical 
shooting's bid for Olympic acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not paintball,'' Alpers said. ``There is a very  
serious political purpose behind this, and that is to legitimize 
the civilian ownership of lethal firearms, which are normally kept 
only for battlefields and SWAT teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In practical shooting, formerly known as combat shooting,  
participants racing against the clock use high-powered guns to 
shoot human-shaped targets in simulated scenarios. For instance, 
the shooter may start in the prone position -- as if lying in bed -- 
and then get up to grab a handgun from a drawer and use it to shoot 
at targets through a window. 
</P>
<P>
	The sport is practiced in about 70 countries, according to  
Alexakos, and will be included as an exhibition, nonmedal sport at 
the 2004 Games in Athens, Greece. 
</P>
<P>
	Josh Sugarmann, executive director of the Violence Policy  
Center, contends the sport's mere existence presents a convenient 
way to skirt laws that prohibit the trade of certain weapons unless 
they are used for sporting purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugarmann also expressed concern over the sport's popularity  
with youngsters, noting that Andrew Golden, the 11-year-old boy who 
was a participant in the Jonesboro, Ark., school shooting last 
year, had taken up practical shooting shortly before the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	``Combat shooting doesn't just violate the goals of the Olympic  
charter, it's an effort by the gun industry and the gun lobby to 
entice kids and help create a youth gun culture,'' Sugarmann said. 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Hollar, president of the 14,000-member U.S. Practical  
Shooting Association, said his organization has no such agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need to understand that we're not a political  
organization; we're a sporting organization,'' Hollar said from 
USPSA headquarters in Sedro Woolley, Wash. ``People are going to 
look at our sport and read into it whatever they want to. We can't 
control that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexakos conceded that practical shooting is a ``long shot'' to  
make it to the Summer Games, but he said its athletes would measure 
up well if ever given a chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking about the same dedication and same commitment  
you find in any Olympic sport,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Tax Cut Debate Shifts to Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The fight over what to do with expected huge  
budget surpluses shifted to the Senate after the House passed a 
$792 billion tax-cutting plan. One House Republican leader said the 
hard-won victory showed the GOP was determined to send money and 
power ``back to the people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill, like the House version, would cut taxes by  
about $792 billion over 10 years. But it does not include the 
House's 10 percent across-the-board income tax cut, which was 
approved Thursday, nor does it repeal estate taxes or cut capital 
gains taxes. It does address the marriage penalty paid by many 
two-income couples and modifies the alternative minimum tax, but in 
different ways than the House. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill, sponsored by Finance Committee Chairman William  
Roth of Delaware, stresses expansion of retirement savings and 
features a reduction in the bottom income tax bracket from 15 
percent to 14 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill split Republicans and Democrats virtually along  
party lines, with Democrats fighting for a much lower tax cut. The 
chances for bipartisanship are far greater in the Senate, where 
Republican leaders intend to bring the tax bill to the floor next 
week. Already, Democrats John Breaux of Louisiana and Bob Kerrey of 
Nebraska are supporting the bill, and others clearly want more than 
modest tax relief. 
</P>
<P>
	But President Clinton said he would veto a tax cut of the  
magnitude Republicans were seeking. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Republicans send me a plan that undermines our ability  
to reform Social Security and Medicare and abandons the fiscal 
discipline that has helped fuel our economic growth, I will send it 
straight back with a veto,'' Clinton said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Brushing aside that threat, the House passed the centerpiece of  
their agenda on a 223-208 vote, with just four Republicans and six 
Democrats breaking ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said passage of the massive tax-cut plan sent a  
clear message to voters about GOP priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is our mission in this city to ship power, money and  
influence back to the people,'' House Budget Committee Chairman 
John Kasich, R-Ohio, said. ``The more money we have in our pockets, 
the more power we have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview later Thursday, Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.,  
said passage of the tax bill was critical ``so we can start to 
deal'' with the president on big budget issues. And he expressed a 
willingness to be flexible on the ultimate size of the tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote came less than 24 hours after Hastert and fellow GOP  
leaders successfully quelled a revolt by a dozen Republican 
moderates. Most of them came aboard when language was included that 
the gradual 10 percent income tax cut will take effect only if 
interest on the national debt drops each year from 2002 to 2009. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a pretty big victory for our party and for the  
speaker,'' said Rep. Ray LaHood, R-Ill., one of the moderates. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill would use up most of the projected $2.9 trillion  
budget surplus over the next 10 years that is not set aside for 
Social Security. Republicans insisted the surplus will be large 
enough to accommodate a refund to taxpayers and guarantee Social 
Security and Medicare for the baby boomers -- but should not usher 
in a new era of big government spending. 
</P>
<P>
	House Democrats characterized the tax cut as a political  
document intended mainly to energize Republican voters as the two 
parties prepare to battle for House control in the 2000 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a Christmas tree. It's decorated with every cut that you  
can get for your Republican supporters,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel, 
D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats also contended the tax cut primarily benefits the  
wealthy and would jeopardize Social Security because it would 
balloon to $3 trillion in cost in the decade beginning in 2010. 
They say it depends on uncertain surplus projections and would 
drain away money for critical government programs such as defense, 
education and environmental protection. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill is a backloaded, budget-busting, billionaire  
bonanza,'' said Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Although about half the total tax benefits would go to taxpayers  
with incomes over $300,000, Republicans said the richest 2 percent 
of taxpayers also contribute 40 percent of income taxes that flow 
into the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats offered a modest $250 billion tax cut focused on the  
marriage penalty and permanent extension of the research and 
development tax credit sought by high-tech business, but it was 
defeated, 258-173. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has indicated he would sign a tax cut of up to $300  
billion if its benefits are targeted at the middle class and the 
other priorities are met. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, whether any of the surplus is used to cut taxes  
depends on negotiations later this year between Clinton and the 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 2488.

<HEADLINE> Smith Blocks Gun Control Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Newly independent Sen. Bob Smith of New  
Hampshire used his Senate prerogatives Thursday as promised to 
thwart Republican attempts to launch formal compromise talks on gun 
control legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith objected when Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,  
made a routine parliamentary request that would have launched the 
compromise talks. A vote was set for Monday to overcome Smith's 
objections and aides in both parties predicted it would have more 
than the 60 votes needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, numerous additional parliamentary motions are needed,  
and it could be another two weeks before Smith has exhausted all 
his opportunities for delay. 
</P>
<P>
	An opponent of gun control, Smith abandoned the Republican Party  
earlier this month, complaining that it was insufficiently 
conservative on that issue and others such as abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate passed legislation last month to impose fresh  
restrictions on guns, including a requirement for background checks 
for all purchasers of weapons at gun shows, a requirement for 
safety devices to be sold with all handguns and a ban on certain 
high capacity ammunition clips. The House rejected its own version 
of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers in both houses have expressed interest in fashioning a  
compromise on the issue, although Democrats have accused 
Republicans of stalling.

<HEADLINE> Fox TV Ad Staff Selling Features </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) -- A salesperson blamed by a Fox  
television affiliate for offering to produce ``positive'' news 
stories for $15,000 no longer works for the company, the station 
owner said. 
</P>
<P>
	The advertising sales staff at WDSI in Chattanooga had told  
businesses the stories would be broadcast on the station's news 
programs. The station scrapped the promotion this month after local 
businesses complained. 
</P>
<P>
	``This entire offer was against company policy and had never  
been approved by the station's news department,'' said David 
Janecek, vice president of news for Pegasus Broadcast Television, a 
Pennsylvania-based company that owns Fox-61. 
</P>
<P>
	He called the incident an ``extreme example of unacceptable  
sales aggressiveness, not an issue of journalistic integrity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The station began broadcasting news shows this year for the  
first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Janecek would not identify the salesperson Thursday. He said  
future advertising promotions will be cleared by the station 
executives.
