<HEADLINE> Palestinian Police Detain Suspected Murderer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Police have
detained a Hamas activist, who was suspected of murdering the
organization's bombmaker Muhi Sharif last month, Israel Radio
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It said that Adel Awadallah, leader of Hamas military wing
Izzadin Al-Qasam, is being held in the West Bank city of
Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
Awadallah was detained amid continued exchange of accusation
between the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) and the radical
militant group Hamas regarding Sharif's death.
</P>
<P>
The PNA announced Monday that Sharif was killed by six fellow
Hamas activists in an internal power struggle on March 29.
</P>
<P>
Five of them were arrested by the Palestinian security
forces early this month. But Awadallah, who was accused of
shooting Sharif to death, had been at large.
</P>
<P>
Hamas rejected the findings of the PNA's investigation, noting
that Israel should be responsible for the murder. In a videotape
released on Wednesday, a masked man, who claimed to be Awadallah,
further accused the PNA of collaborating with Israel in Sharif's
killing.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, senior members of Islamic Jihad group in Gaza
said on Saturday that the Palestinian police have detained one
of their group's leaders Abdallah Ashami.
</P>
<P>
They said Ashami was arrested Thursday after claiming during
a summon in a Gaza Mosque that the PNA was behind the
death of Sharif.
</P>
<P>
In the last three days, the Palestinian police have also
reportedly detained three high-ranking Hamas members, including
the group's leader in Gaza Aziz Abdel Rantisi.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Germany Continue Training Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Minister of Education
Hussein Kamel Bahaa Eddin said Saturday that the German government
has agreed to extend the Mubarak-Kohl Project for technical
education up to the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East News Agency quoted the minister as saying that
the decision was taken in the light of achievements realized since
the project was launched in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The joint Egyptian-German project, which was named after
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, aims to turn out for skilled workers to serve Egyptian
industry.
</P>
<P>
The project is being applied in 10 new Egyptian industrial
cities. More than 2,200 trainees are receiving instruction at 12
schools of the project.
</P>
<P>
Trainees receive on-the-job instruction in mechanics,
electronics, ready-to-wear clothes industries, heavy equipment,
nursing, weaving and leather crafts.
</P>
<P>
They are trained at factories which adopt the project and at
schools which are situated at the sites of the factories. More
than 62 German experts participated in the project.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian-German ties have been going strong despite the
September 18 terrorist bombing last year in front of the Egyptian
Museum here, which killed nine German tourists and their Egyptian
driver.
</P>
<P>
Germany is the No. 1 tourist source for Egypt. Around 460,000
Germans come to visit Egypt annually.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Pakistan Faces Daunting Task of Anti- </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Increasingly rampant smuggling
has caused serious concern in Pakistan as this south Asian nation
is suffering losses estimated at hundreds of millions of U.S.
dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government, which is facing an acute shortfall of
revenue during the current fiscal year (July 1-June 30), has
adopted a series of measures to deal with the worsening situation.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures released by the Central Board of Revenue
(CBR) showed that during the first nine months of 1997-98, the
government has collected only 197 billion rupees (4.5 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
That has resulted an estimated shortfall of 30 billion rupees
(682 million dollars) in the revised down revenue target of 305
billion rupees (6.9 billion dollars) for the whole of 1997-98 and
the government is now hard-pressed to achieve the budget deficit
target of five percent of gross domestic product (GDP) set with
the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
Smuggling along Pakistan's borders with neighboring countries
is one of the major causes for huge revenue losses by the central
government, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Smuggling has also badly hit the already stagnant industries
and much-needed foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
As a local press report said, the smuggling problem has led to
"a fearful state of stagnation never ever witnessed in the country
before."
</P>
<P>
Official sources confirmed that a high-level meeting was held
recently at the CBR to discuss a new drive to counter smuggling
and prepare a list of active smugglers.
</P>
<P>
The government, knowing that transit trade along the
Pakistani-Afghan border has been very brisk for a long time, has
taken a number of measures to stop the inflow of foreign goods
into Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Commerce Minister Ishaq Dar has reportedly taken the charge of
an anti-smuggling operation, and the government is sealing off the
border with Afghanistan to curb smuggling activities with a view
to eliminating the so-called "parallel economy" involving billions
of dollars.
</P>
<P>
Former president of Balochistan Chamber of Commerce and
Industry Khalifa Tahir has proposed that Afghanistan should have
its own tariff structure.
</P>
<P>
He says that for Afghanistan, Pakistan's move to levy customs
tariff on transit goods would minimize the menace of smuggling and
be beneficial to inter-state trade.
</P>
<P>
Local economists say Tahir's proposal is practical and
feasible. The interests of local industries would be well
protected and Afghanistan would also benefit in monetary terms.
</P>
<P>
According to a U.N. report, smugglers have already established
a "parallel economy" in Pakistan, and the CBR is therefore
considering imposing customs duties on the Afghan transit trade.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Pakistan's loss of revenue from Customs is
around 30 billion rupees annually (682 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is also suffering huge revenue losses from unofficial
trade with its long-time rival neighbor of India.
</P>
<P>
Due to restrictive trade policies governing trade between the
two South Asian nations, a substantial amount of bilateral trade
originates as "parallel trade" in the form of unrecorded trade.
</P>
<P>
This includes smuggling through border trade and indirect trade
where Pakistani importers procure Indian goods via third places
like Dubai, Hong Kong and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Unofficial trade between Pakistan and India is estimated to be
two or four times the regular and official trade.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's free trade with India is restricted so as to protect
local industries from tough competition by Indian goods. Many
Pakistani business people are also opposing the move to give India
the Most-Favored Nation status, arguing that such a policy will
badly hit the domestic industry.
</P>
<P>
However, many other business people are in favor of opening
trade with India, saying Pakistan could benefit from the transfer
of Indian technology, especially in the field of engineering and
computer.
</P>
<P>
They also say Pakistan would be saving a large amount of
foreign exchange and that prices would come down since Indian
finished goods are much cheaper than similar goods being imported
from other countries and regions in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say direct trade with India would generate more
revenue for the government in the form of customs duties and It is
the most practical way of curbing illegal trade between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
However, direct trade is hardly possible at least in the near
future, as a number of outstanding problems between the two
arch-rivals in South Asia, including the Kashmir issue, are posing
a stumbling block to it.
</P>
<P>
And it seems a protracted process and a tough job for the
Pakistani government to stop the Afghan transit trade, or
smuggling, due to the on-going armed conflict in that war-ravaged
country, as well as political and economic reasons, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Backs Syria, Lebanon over Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia has expressed
its firm support for Syria and Lebanon in their demand that Israel
withdraw from south Lebanon unconditionally, the Saudi Press
Agency reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom expressed hope that the prospect of carrying out
the United Nations Resolution 425 by Israel will be coupled with a
revival of the peace talks between Syria and Israel from the point
they have reached, a statement issued by the Saudi government late
Friday night said.
</P>
<P>
Israel approved the adoption of the U.N. resolution on April 1,
paving the way for its withdrawal from south Lebanon. But,
meanwhile, it demanded that the Lebanese government agree to
security arrangements for the bordering areas.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria, which agree to coordinate their stances on
key issues, have rejected Israel's offer, maintaining that the
Jewish state should withdraw from south Lebanon unconditionally
under the U.N. resolution.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Resolution 425 passed in 1978 after Israeli invasion
of Lebanon calls for an unconditional Israeli pullback from
south Lebanon, where it set up a security zone in 1985 to
allegedly protect its northern areas from cross-border attacks by
Muslim guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri visited the Saudi Arabia
last month and discussed with Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn
Abdul-Aziz Israel's attempt to dodge the implementation of the
U.N. resolution.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia, Democratic Congo Sign General Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The governments of Ethiopia
and Democratic Republic of Congo signed here on Saturday a
general agreement which will serve as a basis for the framework
of cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
According to a joint communique issued here at the end of the
five-day state visit to Ethiopia by Democratic Congolese
president Laurent Desire Kabila, the agreement was signed by
president Kabila and Ethiopian president Negasso Gidada at a
ceremony held at the National Palace here.
</P>
<P>
The communique said the two presidents declared their determi-
nation to enhance and further strengthen the existing bonds of
friendship between the brotherly peoples of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
It further said the two heads of state underlined the
importance of launching close cooperation in the political,
economic and social sectors.
</P>
<P>
The communique said, a joint ministerial meeting of the two
countries which was held here looked exhaustively into a number
of areas including agriculture, transport, small and medium-scale
enterprises, mining, energy, education and culture with a view to
deepening the expanding relations and bilateral cooperation
between the two countries.
</P>

LUANDA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- An United Nations official said
here Saturday that the Angolan government should take effective
actions to guarantee stability in the country.
</P>
<P>
UN special envoy to Angola Blondin Beye said in central

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Interest Rate Battle Among Thai Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A slogan hung outside a Bangkok
branch of Laem Thong Bank looks very attractive. It says the bank
provides its customers with duty-free deposit accounts plus a
three percent special bonus.
</P>
<P>
This is the bank's new measure to attract deposits. In fact, a
battle for attracting deposits by raising interest rates has
already started among the 15 commercial banks in Thailand, which,
under the central bank's requirement, need to increase their
capital substantially.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok Metropolitan Bank, Siam City Bank, First Bangkok City
Bank and Bangkok Bank of Commerce, the four banks taken over by
the government regulators after the financial crisis last July,
are offering an average deposit interest rate of as high as 16.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
Raising deposits is necessary for the four banks to mobilize
funds to repay their outstanding loans to the financial
institutions development fund.
</P>
<P>
Due to the interest rates battle, deposits throughout the
banking system have shifted away from large commercial banks in
the first quarter of this year to small and medium-sized banks
such as Laem Thong Bank, which offer almost 400 basis points
higher interest than large banks.
</P>
<P>
According to figures of the Thai Bankers' association, the
hardest hit was Bangkok Bank, the country's largest bank, which
lost 28.36 billion baht (709 million U.S. dollars) in deposits
from January to February. It was followed by Siam Commercial Bank
with a drop of 20.26 billion baht (506.5 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
To meet the challenges, big banks took their actions. Bangkok
Bank branch managers were instructed to use their own judgment in
offering deposit interest rates to favored customers.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok Bank currently offers fixed deposit rates of 10-12.75
percent, but managers are now authorized to offer up to 300 basis
points more to maintain their deposit base, one executive said.
</P>
<P>
Higher deposit rates lead to the soaring cost of the banking
operations. Banks were forced to increase their lending interest
rates to make profit.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Bangkok Bank increased its lending interest
rates by 25-75 basis points, setting its minimum lending rate at
15.5 percent. Other banks are expected to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's banks, faced with the need to increase loan-loss
provisions, have exploited high rates by mobilizing deposits for
relending in the money market, which offers higher spreads and
lower risks than lending to retail or corporate customers.
</P>
<P>
The fierce competition for funds is exacting its own toll on
the overall economy by preventing lending rates from easing,
squeezing the corporate sector.
</P>
<P>
Many cash-strapped businesses in the country complain that the
banks' reluctance to extend new credit was squeezing cashflow and
delaying prospects of an economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda said recently that
interest rate rises reflected continued tight liquidity in the
financial system, which in turn requires the central bank to keep
its policy of high interest rates unchanged to lure more funds
into the country.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin said interest rate declines were impossible until the
basic problems of the economy were tackled and liquidity pressure
eased.
</P>
<P>
Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai has also underlined the
importance of maintaining high interest rates to attract capital
inflow.
</P>
<P>
He said that once there was sufficient capital, the liquidity
problem would be eased and interest rates go down automatically.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he conceded that, in the long run, high interest
rates would be damaging to the economy and would drive many
businesses to go bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
There is no sign yet of a "cease-fire" in Thai banks' battle of
interest rates. Businesses have to suffer more, and people are
told that it's the price the country has to pay for the financial
crisis.

<HEADLINE> Paint Can Be Indication of Corroding Metal: Magazine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A type of paint that changes
colors when the metal underneath corrodes is being developed by a
group of American researchers, New Scientist magazine reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The paint, tested at Ohio State University, the United States,
is still years away from commercial application, but it may
eventually be used to reveal early signs of corrosion on aircraft,
the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary studies in the lab have shown that the paint
changed colors around corrosion pits a thousandth of a centimetre
deep, which are too small to be seen with the naked eye.
</P>
<P>
The paint, a mixture of clear acrylic paint with Ph indicators
that react to the Ph changes associated with the corrosion
reactions, can change color with any increase in acidity or
alkalinity.
</P>
<P>
However, the method only works with clear paint and cannot be
used on parts of the plane covered with colored paints. Instead,
researchers are developing another kind of paint that fluoresces
in ultraviolet light when the Ph changes.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda to Launch Economic Growth Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan Government has
announced a three-year economic program aiming at economic
growth and poverty reduction.
</P>
<P>
Prosper Musafari, Director of Macro-Economic Policy in the
Ministry of Planning, said that this program will start in August
1998 and end in the year 2001, according to Rwanda News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The program targets at a 7.5 percent economic growth, while
keeping the inflation rate down at 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan government will also need to carry out fiscal,
monetary, and structural policy reforms that would keep inflation
down, and safeguard stable exchange rate of the Rwandan Franc.
</P>
<P>
Musafari said structural and institutional reforms envisaged
by the government will focus on the promotion of the private
sector by encouraging both domestic and foreign private
investment, the reform of the civil service which implies the
retrenchment of some workers, and turning the agriculture-based
Rwandan economy into an export-oriented one.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan Ministry of Finance and Planning, however, has
indicated that this program will largely depend on foreign aid,
with regard to a 200 million US Dollars gap that needs to be
bridged up.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral and multilateral creditors who have come up with
promises to help narrow down this financial gap, include the
World Bank with 60 million dollars for the year to come, the
European Union 42 million, the African Development Bank 20
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund promised 72 million U.S.
Dollars in support of the balance of payment, and Holland about
22 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
In order to successfully implement the program, some reforms
going in line with better management of public resources, the
support of the private sector, and the strengthening of the
existing infrastructures, as well as the creation of others, will
be implemented.
</P>
<P>
Other measures will have to do with enhancing good governance
and accountability, and promoting investment.

ANKARA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK) has attacked a military helicopter in the
southeastern province of Sirnak, killing a village guard, the
semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The incident happened late Friday night when PKK militants
raided the helicopter carrying security forces to the region to
reinforce fightings against the rebels, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The helicopter sustained minor damages in the attack, but
landed safely, it added.
</P>
<P>
Emergency Regional Rule Governor Aydin Arslan was quoted by the
news agency as saying that 25,000 PKK rebels were rendered
ineffective since Turkey imposed the state of emergency in the
southeast in a bid to wipe out PKK militants in 1987.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 14-year-old war for autonomy in
eastern and southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The PKK militants, who have sought shelters in northern Iraq
since 1991, often launch cross-border attacks on Turkey's military

Government top officials have started touring the country
since Wednesday, visiting agricultural projects, and
co-operatives of farmers in a bid to encourage them to increase
productivity.
</P>
<P>
Areas, like the southern and western parts of the country are
badly hit by famine and the local population is appealing for
food relief.

In Gikongoro prefecture, south of the capital, the situation
is dramatic, as indicated by its Prefect Augustin Mutijima
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Since last November, 400 people died of hunger or
nutrition-related diseases, " he pointed out, blaming the
pandemonium on the acid soils of his region, and the low
purchasing power of farmers who can not afford fertilizers.

"We have been sending missions in that area to assess the
situation, "an official of the World Food Program (WFP) told
Rwanda News Agency, adding that the agency has been operational

<HEADLINE> France Marks Bicentenary of Birth of Delacroix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 11 (Xinhua) -- France is marking the bicentenary
of the birth of one of the greatest painters in the world in 19th
century, Eugene Delacroix, the author of "Liberty Guides the
People," "The Death of Sardanapale," and "the Massacres of Scio."
</P>
<P>
Several exhibitions are being held in Paris and a number of
other French cities to memorize the great painter who was a
milestone of both neo-classicism and romanticism.
</P>
<P>
An exhibition of the latter-day works of Delacroix is being
held in the Grand Palace in Paris, displaying all the paintings
done by him from 1850 to 1863, the year when he died.
</P>
<P>
Born in a great Bourgeois mansion in Charenton-Saint-Maurice
near Paris on April 26, 1798, Delacroix was also the master
painter of decorations in the great Paris palaces such as the
Bourbon Palace where the French National Assembly is based, the
Luxembourg Palace where is the French Senate, and the City Hall of
Paris.
</P>
<P>
Included in the exhibition in the Grand Palace are the famous
"Lion Hunt" series, depiction of violent fight between a hunter
and a lion which he saw when he made a tour to North Africa in
1832.
</P>
<P>
His paintings of pasturage and flowers, which were strongly
influenced by his contemporary British water-colorists and by his
precedding compatriots Le Lorrain and Nicolas Poussin in the 17th
century, were also displayed in the Grand Palace.
</P>
<P>
The house in Saint-Maurice in which Delacroix was born will
also open to the public from April 25 to June 28, and exhibitions
of his works are also being displayed in Rouen, Tour, Chantilly
and the Louvre Museum in Paris.

JOHANNESBURG, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A total of 82 people have

Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Police said 31 percent of the road accidents involved
pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
"One of the major problems is the walking person's
misinterpretation of speed. This is compounded by the
pedestrian's lack of understanding of the traffic situation,"
SAPA quoted an "Arrive Alive" road safety campaign spokeswoman as
saying.
</P>
<P>
She said alcohol also played a role in these accidents as many
pedestrians were drunk when crossing the road.

LONDON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- David Trimble, leader of Ulster
Unionis Part (UUP), won a vote of confidence over the Northern
Ireland peace agreement on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Some 78 members of the UUP's 110-strong policy-making executive
voted for the deal by a majority of two to one, according to
officials emerging from a UUP meeting in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
They said it followed heated discussions of the peace accord
thrashed out on Friday after 22-month on and off peace talks
sponsored by British and Irish governments.
</P>
<P>
The peace deal now faces approval by a meeting of the party's
council on April 17. UUP is Northern Ireland's largest pro-British
party.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, Trimble told reporters the party
executive had recommended the peace deal to the council and he was
confident it would be passed.
</P>
<P>
"There are parts of this agreement that we are not happy with,"
he was quoted by Reuters as saying. "But we have judged that we
have enough here to build on."
</P>
<P>
Trimble said he was sure of "massive support" in a referendum
to be held on May 22 in both Northern Ireland and the Irish

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Parliament Slams British Proposal for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 11 (Xinhua)-- Iraqi National Assembly
(parliament) Saturday called for issuing a statement unveiling the
"ill intentions" behind a British proposal for hosting a
conference on the Iraqi-U.N. oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
Britain has called for a meeting in London of the program's
various bodies and aid organizations to work out ways of speeding
up the delivery of humanitarian goods under the agreement.
</P>
<P>
During its first spring session Saturday, the assembly decided
to send a delegation to the Damascus-based Arab
Inter-Parliamentary Union in order to abort the proposed
conference, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
It said that the statement will be addressed to national,
regional and international parliamentary unions.
</P>
<P>
The assembly also stressed the need to send a telegram to
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, urging him to allow no party
other than the United Nations to discuss any matter concerning
Iraq-related U.N. resolutions without the consent of the Iraqi
government.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the assembly's Arab and International Relations
Committee Saad Qassim Hammoudi said that the aims behind the
British proposal unmasked part of the wicked and hypocritical
approach long pursued by the British government against the people
of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said the British proposal is dubious in timing and in
content, accusing Britain of collaborating with the United States
to prolong the sufferings of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
"Britain is trying to take advantage of its current presidency
of the European Union to rally support for the British-American
scheme," said Hammoudi. "The proposal is of political purpose,
not humanitarian one," he told reporters outside the building of
the assembly.
</P>
<P>
Hammoudi said Iraq had dealt positively with every proposal
aimed at ensuring swift implementation of the oil-for-food deal,
whether in relations to the financial allocations or to the
improvement of the mechanism of implementation in a way to
achieve its humanitarian target as a temporary measure, rather
than an alternative to the lifting of the U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said the British representative in the U.N. Sanctions
Committee on Iraq had always sought to block or put on hold the
food and medicine contracts Iraq had concluded under the
memorandum of understanding reached with the United Nations on
May 20, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is allowed to sell up to 5.2 billion U.S. dollars worth of
oil over six months, from the present 2 billion dollars, to buy
food and medicines for its people suffering from the crippling
sanctions imposed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A total of 5,584 Iraqi prisoners
of war released by Iran have come back home, Iraqi Foreign
Under-Secretary Riyadh al-Qaisi said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a television interview, al-Qaisi said that in a new round
of repatriation of POWs early this month, Iran freed 5,592 Iraqis,
of whom one died of heart attack during the process and seven
others refused to return home.
</P>
<P>
During the biggest POW swap between the two countries since
1990, Iraq also freed three Iranian POWs and 316 others it
classified as civil law detainees.
</P>
<P>
The POWs were captured during the 1980-88 Iraq-Iran war.
</P>
<P>
The move came as a result of recent talks between the two
former foes in an effort to warm up their relations.
</P>
<P>
Al-Qaisi said that another round of talks on the issue will be
held between the two sides on April 18 in Baghdad and it will last
for about a week.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue our talks with Iranian officials to get
information on Iraqi soldiers held by Iran," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq will also ask the Red Crescent to interview those who
have refused to return," the Iraqi official said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq will also be concerned about those missing in the war, he
added.

CAIRO, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal
el-Ganzouri Saturday announced a decision to set up a new
industrial zone in Upper Egypt, the Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the General Investments Authority and Free Zones
Ibrahim Fawzi said projects to be set up on an area of 2,000
feddans (84 hectares) in Fayoum governorate, about 120 kilometers
south of Cairo, will benefit from privileges, exemptions and
guarantees provided under the investment incentives and guarantees
law.
</P>
<P>
Projects to be set up in this zone will be exempted from taxes
for 10 years and will enjoy other facilities such as being
provided with land complete with the infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the new industrial zone in Fayoum is part
of the government's plan to develop Upper Egyptian governorates
and contribute to providing job opportunities, activating exports
and maximizing national product.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is trying to narrow the gap between Lower Delta areas and
Upper Egyptian governorates that suffer from a chronic lack of
investment and are denied an equal share of attention.
</P>
<P>
In the past 30 years, Egypt has built altogether 26 industrial
zones where products manufactured according to local conditions
are mostly for export.

JERUSALEM, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Chief negotiator of the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Saeb Erekat sent a letter on
Saturday to some United States senators to clarify the facts that
the PNA has abided by the Oslo Agreement.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. senators have misrepresented the facts and have no
basis in fact," Erekat, who is also PNA minister of local
government, said in the letter, according to the Jerusalem Media
and Communication Center.
</P>
<P>
A number of U.S. senators have reportedly written to U.S.
President Bill Clinton, urging him not to make public a plan on
Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank on the grounds that the
Palestinians have not implemented the Oslo agreement.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has reportedly outlined a plan calling on Israel to
withdraw from 13.1 percent of the West Bank in several steps over
12 weeks. But it has yet to announce the plan.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, it is the Israeli government that is
violating the signed agreements as it is continuing to expand
Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, confiscate Arab
land and demolish Palestinian homes, Erekat said.
</P>
<P>
He called on the U.S. senators and members of House of
Representatives not to be taken along in the misleading campaigns
orchestrated by the supporters of the Israeli government against
peace and the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: U.S., EU Still Involved in Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Egypt expressed its conviction
Saturday that the United States and European Union can not walk
away from the Mideast peace process, the Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
"I believe no major power, including the U.S. and the EU in
particular, can wash their hands off the peace process due to
grave prospects of failure or suspension of the peace process,"
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that peace in the Middle East is an integral part
of world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is still calling on the U.S. to openly announce its
initiative and the stances of the parties concerned on this
initiative, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are also calling for the U.S. role as an honest broker
seeking to reach a balanced peace among parties based on good
faith and commitment to the signed peace agreements," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moussa's statement came before U.S. Mideast peace envoy Dennis
Ross is expected to return to the Mideast late in April in what is
viewed as his last bid to press the U.S. initiative via quiet
diplomacy to break the year-long deadlock in Mideast peace-making.
</P>
<P>
Washington reportedly wants Israel to pull back from 13.1
percent of the West Bank over 12 weeks accompanied by security
cooperation from the Palestinians. But it has not publically or
officially announced the initiative yet.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has warned that the
United States will wash its hands off the peace process if Israel
insisted on rejecting its offer.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming visit to the region by British Prime Minister Tony
Blair, which apparently overlaps with Ross' tour, is expected to
help press the Israeli government to accept the U.S. proposals.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli talks have been stalled for months over
Israeli construction of a new settlement in Arab East Jerusalem
and long-delayed troop redeployment in the West bank.

TIANJIN, April 12 (Xinhua) -- North China port city of Tianjin
has established a scientific fodder development center in a bid to
promote the development of its fodder and breeding industries.
</P>
<P>
The center was jointly established by the Tianjin Municipal
Fodder Industrial Association and the Animal Husbandry and
Veterinary Science Institute under the Tianjin Municipal Academy
of Agricultural Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that Tianjin's fodder industry currently has
an annual production capacity of one million tons, low-level
scientific content has greatly reduced the market competitiveness
of local products.
</P>
<P>
Local officials expect the new center to increase applications
of the fodder industry's scientific achievements, as well as
promote the development of products with high technological
content and enhance research related to quality control and
monitoring technology.
</P>
<P>
The center will also offer training courses to disseminate new
fodder and breeding technology, as well as promote information

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou, capital of south
China's Guangdong Province, is set to simplify transaction
formalities on the secondary property market effective April 15.
</P>
<P>
The move, which is expected to reduce the time required for
property transactions from 48 to 10 working days, is designed to
further boost property transactions on the secondary market.
</P>
<P>
Procedures for property appraisals and approval of transactions
will be simplified, with requirements calling for all transactions
to be completed within the specified time.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Guangzhou recorded primary property market sales of
4.23 million sq.m., with the total turnover standing at 27.9
billion yuan (3.36 billion US dollars). Some 30,900 sq.m. of
projected buildings and 186,100 sq.m. of private housing were sold
on the secondary market.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the sluggish secondary market to high
transaction fees and taxes, excessive transaction completion
periods, and the lack of fund backing from banks.
</P>
<P>
However, the Guangzhou Branch of the Agricultural Bank of China
is now offering mortgage loans on the secondary market.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Backs Palestinians to Fulfil Rights: Majali </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Prime Minister Abdul-Salam
Majali said here Sunday that Jordan will always support the
Palestinians in their endeavor to fulfil their rights.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with heads of media departments at the
Information Ministry, Majali said the kingdom will especially
support the Palestinians in the pursuit of establishing their own
independent state with Jerusalem as the capital.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Majali said, Jordan stresses the importance
of resuming the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks which have been
stalled since March 1997 when Israel broke ground for construction
of a controversial Jewish neighborhood in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
By restarting the talks, it is expected to break the current
stalemate caused by the Israeli government hardline policy, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Majali called on the Israeli government to fulfill
its commitment to peace. "It is the only means to bring about
peace and stability to the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Late last month, Israel rejected a U.S. proposal calling for
Israeli troop redeployment from 13.1 percent of the West Bank over
12 weeks, arguing that any pullback more than 9 percent will
jeopardize its security.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli opposition rendered the mission of U.S. peace envoy
Dennis Ross to the Middle East region a failure. Jordan, which
signed peace with Israel in 1994, refrained from being critical of
Israel's hardline policies, but expressed satisfaction with the
Palestinians' coordination with the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Ross is expected to be back in the region soon in a
"last-ditch" effort to persuade both sides to compromise over a
revised withdrawal plan, which reportedly demands Israel to turn
over 9 percent of the West Bank to full Palestinian control and
another 3 percent to Palestinian civil control.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The prolonged drought gripping
western Guangdong Province has severely affected the maturation of
early Spring rice in the cities of Maoming and Zhanjiang.
</P>
<P>
The cities, both of which are major grain production
bases, have suffered from a severe shortage of precipitation over
the past three months.
</P>
<P>
The average rainfall for Maoming between January and March 1998
dropped by some 33 percent on last year's same period, with the
figure for Zhanjiang falling by close to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
The two cities have responded to the problem by purchasing
irrigation equipment, and over 700,000 Maoming farmers are
currently watering their fields on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
Reports that related efforts have greatly relieved related

<HEADLINE> Nepali Congress Decides to Form One-Party Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali Congress (NC), the
largest party in parliament, decided Sunday to form a minority
government on its own strength, but there is a possibility that it
might try to find a ruling partner, an informed source said.
</P>
<P>
The talks between the NC and the Communist Party of Nepal
(Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML), the NC's chosen potential ruling
partner, on formation of a coalition government reached a deadlock
over allocation of portfolios, the source said.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-ML is a breakaway faction of the main opposition
Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML).
</P>
<P>
The NC's decision to form a minority government amounts to a
suicidal game, a minister of the care-taker government was quoted
by the source as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minority government led by Man Mohan Adhikari of the
CPN-UML about three years ago lasted only 10 months.
</P>
<P>
As the general elections are due by November 1999, the scramble
for power is sure to become more tense in the country, so the
possibility can not be ruled out that the NC will rethink its
decision and try to find a ruling partner to make a stable
government, the source said.
</P>
<P>
When accepting the resignation tendered last Friday by Prime
Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa, King Birendra asked members of the
lower house of parliament who can muster a simple majority of 103
votes in the 205-seat House to stake a claim to power by 18:00
p.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Coalition politics emerged in Nepal after the mid-term polls in
November 1994 produced a hung parliament where no single party
commands a majority. The NC has only 87 MPs in the lower house.
</P>
<P>
Under Nepal's constitution, in the event that a coalition
government cannot be formed, King Birendra may ask the party with
the largest number of MPs in the house to form a government.
</P>
<P>
Surya Bahadur Thapa stepped down to make way for the NC, one of
his ruling partners, to lead a new government under an agreement
he reached before he took office last October.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Minister Calls for Referendum over Tehran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Iran's moderate Interior Minister
Abdullah Nouri Saturday called for a referendum to determine the
case of Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein Karbaschi who was detained for
alleged financial scandal.
</P>
<P>
The moderate newspaper Iran Daily Sunday quoted Nouri as
saying that a referendum must be held to show the people's stance
on Tehran mayor's case and the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
"If the case of the (Tehran) mayor and the municipality is a
national issue, why is a poll not conducted to learn of the
people's views?" he asked in a speech at a meeting of mayors of
Tehran's 20 districts.
</P>
<P>
The minister termed Karbaschi's detention "outrageous,"
saying that the arrest of a person "who until yesterday would
attend cabinet meetings and make decisions in the interest of the
system and the (Islamic) revolution is totally unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
Nouri, a major aide and supporter of President Mohammad
Khatami, also recalled the decrees of late Iranian supreme leader
Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini to defend Karbaschi for his dauntless
reforms in the capital city during the past eight years.
</P>
<P>
The late leader Imam Khomeini very rarely used the word
"intellectual" for a person, but in one of his decrees to
Karbaschi, he called the mayor "an intellectual of the
revolution," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister also announced the formation of a special center
to defend Tehran mayor at the Interior Ministry premises by
gathering documents about Tehran municipality and Karbaschi's
achievements during the past years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, presidential advisor and secretary general of the
council of free trade zones Morteza Alviri called Karbaschi a
"national hero," saying that those who are fighting against the
mayor intend to revenge the construction period under the
leadership of former president Hashemi Rafsanjani and the
landslide victory of present President Mohammad Khatami in last
May's presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the pro-Khatami newspaper Iran News, Alviri said
that it would be to the nation's benefit to free Karbaschi and
try those who have created the scenario because if the government
failed to try the culprits the people would rise and question
them.
</P>
<P>
The 44-year-old mayor was detained last week on an alleged
financial scandal. But his supporters were reportedly mobilizing
to rescue him from the attacks of the conservatives, calling on
supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to arbitrate.

<P>
SHENYANG, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Guoguang, governor of
northeast China's Liaoning Province, today urged the mayors of the
province's 14 major cities to help 400,000 laid-off workers find
new jobs within the year.
</P>
<P>
Local governments must shoulder the responsibility for ensuring
the reemployment of laid-off workers, according to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning, which leads all other provinces in terms of workers
in state-owned enterprises, has helped 1.22 million people,
including one million laid-off workers, find jobs over the past
three years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics for 1997 listed 1.17 million unemployed
people. Officials estimate the province will have an additional
one million jobless people over the coming two years.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has pledged to help 1.2 million
laid-off workers find new opportunities over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Laid-off workers are being encouraged to engage in agricultural
production in rural areas or to work in other parts of the
country. Some laid-off workers are also expected to find new
opportunities with businesses in the service sector.

<HEADLINE> In-depth Reforms Required to Fulfill Economic Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- China will expand domestic demand
and accelerate economic restructuring in order to ensure
fulfillment of the eight percent economic growth rate targeted for
1998, said Zeng Peiyan, minister of the new State Development
Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
The government will boost demand by investing more in
agriculture, forestry, water conservation, railways and highways,
telecommunications, environmental protection, technological
upgrades and housing, said Zeng.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that related investments will not spark an
overheated economy, but integrate the expansion of domestic demand
with improvements in the industrial pattern.
</P>
<P>
In terms of macro-controls, the government will place priority
on carrying out reform of the financial system, grain circulation
and urban housing, said the minister, adding that his commission
will shoulder most of the burden.
</P>
<P>
The goal of reform is to further diminish the remnants of the
planned economy in related areas, according to Zeng.
</P>
<P>
The commission's major tasks in the future will focus on
formulating the nation's medium- and long-term development
programs, balancing overall supply and demand, improving the
industrial pattern, and strengthening controls over pricing,
investments and state material reserves, said Zeng.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Refutes Allegations of Foreign Aid to Missile Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan on Sunday strongly
refuted the allegations of foreign aid to its development of a new
surface to surface missile.
</P>
<P>
"Such reports, emanating from abroad, are not only baseless but
also betray ulterior motives," a Foreign Office spokesman said in
a statement issued here.
</P>
<P>
He was reacting to a report carried by the New York Times on
Saturday that the Hatf-V (Ghauri) missile test-fired by Pakistan
on April 6 was smuggled from the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Two years from the start of the 2000 Census, it is shaping
up as the most contentious in 80 years, generating a firestorm of
debate and strategizing in Congress and litigation aimed at
blocking the Census Bureau from changing the way it does business.
</P>
<P>
-- George J. Mitchell, the American negotiator in the Irish
peace agreement, said he devoted three years to the task to
provide Irish children with peace, stability and reconciliation:

ireland's biggest political party voted to back the agreement, in
a victory for the leader of the Ulster Unionist party, David
Trimble, who overcame rebels in his ranks.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- NASA officials said they have drawn up guidelines designed
to avoid a repeat of what they consider an embarrassing false
alarm that threatened Earth with an asteroid collision.

at reducing bacteria in fruit and vegetables.

<HEADLINE> Great Wall Section Discovered in Inner Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists have
discovered a new section of the ancient Great Wall, a structure
which dates back well over 2,000 years, in north China's Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region, according to China Youth Daily.
</P>
<P>
The section meanders for over 200 km through sparsely populated
areas near the Urad Front Banner of the region.
</P>
<P>
Ancient Chinese used locally quarried black stones to build the
wall which is 5-6 meter high and three meters wide, according to
archeologists.
</P>
<P>
The remoteness of the section has ensured that it remains
virtually intact.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists point to the discovery of the section as
equalling the significance of an earlier find by Professor Luo
Zhewen, a specialist in the history of the Great Wall. Luo
discovered a section of the wall dating to the Qin Dynasty
(1644-1911) near the city of Baotou in the same region.
</P>
<P>
The section features small beacon towers located one kilometer
apart, with large beacon towers found every five kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Experts point out the section, one of the most highly preserved
sections found in recent years, is a rare historical treasure
which will greatly enhance future research.
</P>
<P>
Historical documents attest to the fact that Qin Shihuang,
China's first emperor who began his reign 221 B.C., dispatched
troops led by General Meng Tian to build the wall in today's Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists working in the region have also unearthed a
cache of cultural relics dating to the Qin Dynasty, with said
objects clearly proving the age of the section.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities have listed section as a key protected
cultural relics site.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the State Bureau of Cultural Relics plans to
provide funds and technical assistance for the protection
effort, according to local officials.

<P>
TIRANA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Western European Union (WEU)
has decided to extend one more year for its police advisers team
which it sent to Albania last year.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian Interior Ministry received a note from the WEU
Saturday saying that the police advisors team will stay in Albania

advisers team further or not in October, the spokesman also said.
</P>
<P>
The police advisers team was sent to Albania last May at the
request of the Albanian government to help Albania reorganize
police force and restore order.
</P>
<P>
There are now 60 police officers from 20 European countries
working in the advisers team.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Warplanes Raid South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes Sunday carried
out a series of air raids on suspected Lebanese guerrilla
positions in south Lebanon, Lebanese Orient Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Israeli fighters swooped down on a mountainous area between
the towns of Armetai and Sujud in the eastern sector of an
Israeli-occupied border enclave in south Lebanon on Sunday
morning, Lebanese security sources were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The area is believed to be used by the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah guerrillas as a base for operations against Israeli
soldiers and their militia allies South Lebanese Army (SLA).
</P>
<P>
A Hezbollah spokesman said in a statement that Israeli planes
attacked al-Iqlim Toufaha area and dropped a total of eight
air-to-surface missiles.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army sources also confirmed the air raids, but
stressed that they attacked Hezbollah's military bases, not
villages and towns.
</P>
<P>
There has been no report of casualties caused by the air raids.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, leads a guerrilla war to oust
Israel's 2,000 soldiers and the 2,500 SLA militiamen from south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a 1,200-square-kilometer self-styled security
zone in south Lebanon in 1985 with the aim of protecting its
northern villages and towns from Lebanese guerrilla cross-border
attacks.

<HEADLINE> Aussies Sweeps 1-2-3 Spots in  World Cup Triathlon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 12 (Xinhua) -- World champion Emma Carney led an
Australian sweep of the top three positions in women's event and
made it an Australian double with Greg Welch in the opener of the
World Cup triathlon in Ishigakijima on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Triathlon will make its Olympic debut in the 2000 Games with
Carney as the top favourite in Sydney. She clocked two hours three
minutes 24 seconds over three categories beating fellow
Australians Jackie Gallagher and Michellie Jones.
</P>
<P>
Carney was only 26th in the first 1.5-kilometre swimming
section in 19:41, but she clocked the fastest times in the 40km
bike and 10km running sections with 1:07:01 and 36:42.
</P>
<P>
Carney, the winner of six World Cup races last season to finish
atop in the rankings, was almost two minutes faster than Gallagher
in 2:05:05 and Jones in 2:05:48, while Isabelle Mouthon of France
came in fourth in 2:05:59.
</P>
<P>
In the men's event, Welch held on to a three-second victory in
a close battle against Jamie Hunt of New Zealand at the final
stage crossing the line in 1:50:57.

KATHMANDU, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali Congress (NC), the

<HEADLINE> Outlawed S. African Pesticides to Be Disposed in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 12 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is to ship
hundreds of tons of internationally outlawed and obsolete
pesticides to Britain for disposal, the Sunday Independent
reported.
</P>
<P>
Among the poisons to be shipped out are stocks of
controversial DDT and dieldrin, which have been in use in South
Africa even though they are banned in most countries.
</P>
<P>
The cleanup operation involves between 750 and 800 tons of
potentially deadly pesticides originally intended for
agricultural use, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The poison will be moved to Wales, Britain, where Rechem, a
disposal company will incinerate it.
</P>
<P>
Etienne Wolmarans, the Agriculture Department's registrar for
pesticide, was quoted as saying that Rechem won the tender
because it had a good record on pesticide disposal in Europe and
there was no such facility in the Southern Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
This is a reversal of the usual trend of developed countries
sending toxic waste to the undeveloped countries for disposal.
</P>
<P>
Jan Kleynhans, Director of the Crop Protection and Animal
Health Association, said the chemicals had to be removed as they
posed an extreme danger to people and the environment.
</P>
<P>
He said that many drums of pesticide bought for farming over
the past 40 years had never been used and lay discarded on farms.
However, the director added that the lion's share of South
Africa's obsolete pesticide stock lay in government depots.
</P>
<P>
Kleynhans said that his association, which was co-ordinating
the retrieval process for the government, had also offered its
services to Namibia and Swaziland.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Campaign War Intensifying in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- With the May 11 presidential
elections just one month away, presidential candidates in the
Philippines have stepped up not only electioneering all over the
country but also backstage political maneuvering.
</P>
<P>
At this point in the campaign, analysts say, mudslinging
between rival candidates may intensify and a new round of
political realignments among the 11 official presidential
candidates could emerge.
</P>
<P>
And some candidates without sufficient fund and strong
political machinery will likely bow out of the race.
</P>
<P>
Various surveys conducted recently by different polling groups
indicated a three-cornered fight in the coming polls among Vice
President Joseph Estrada of the United Opposition, Manila Mayor
Alfredo Lim of the Liberal Party and Speaker of the House of
Representatives Jose de Venecia of the ruling Lakas-NUCD party.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, a former action movie star popular among the ordinary
masses, has led in all the three public opinion polls conducted
since January this year by the Social Weather Stations (SWS), a
leading independent pollster in the country.
</P>
<P>
The 60-year-old Estrada, nicknamed "Erap", has been a clear
favorite for the respondents with a 28 percent supporting rate in
the latest SWS poll despite repeated mudslinging by his rivals
during recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
In the same poll, De Venecia, who has ranked poorly in previous
SWS surveys, jumped to second place with 14 percent in a tie with
Alfredo Lim, who has the backing of former president Corazon
Aquino and, allegedly, the country's powerful Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
It seems that De Venecia, who enjoys the strong support of
President Fidel Ramos, still has a slim chance to catch up with
Estrada, on whom De Venecia's camp has reportedly undertaken a
"demolition job" since last month.
</P>
<P>
Among the charges against Estrada were his involvement in a
financial scandal and his secret plan to assassinate Ramos in
order to obtain the country's highest post at an early date.
</P>
<P>
Both charges were bluntly denied by Estrada whose camp
counter-charged that Ramos and other administration officials were
involved in a land scandal.
</P>
<P>
Alfredo Lim, a Filipino-Chinese, was also under attack. His
rivals instigated a lawyer to ask the Commission on Elections
(Comelec) to question Lim's citizenship.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer said in a petition that Lim is not a natural-born
Filipino because his parents were Chinese "mestizos." Under the
constitution, only natural-born Filipinos may seek the presidency.
The Comelec will rule on this petition soon.
</P>
<P>
There are still no signs yet that such muckraking may subside.
Instead, many fear that mudslinging and black propaganda will
intensify as the election day is fast approaching.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, political regroupings among different political
forces are expected during the remaining 30 campaign days as some
candidates are running out of their funds.
</P>
<P>
Lack of political strength may also force some lower-ranking
candidates to give up and shift their backing to those
front-runners who have better chances to win in the national
polls.
</P>
<P>
Among the 11 presidential contenders, only the ruling party and
Estrada's United Opposition have nationwide grassroots
organizations and put up a complete senatorial slate for the May
polls.
</P>
<P>
During the May polls, voters will also elect 12 of the
24-member Senate. A complete senatorial ticket is seen as a vital
gauge of a party's political strength since senators are elected
by national votes.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, regrouping will also take place among the
generous financiers of certain presidential candidates who remain
at the tail end of the popularity polls.
</P>
<P>
The financiers of those who have not figured prominently in the
presidential race will start looking for other candidates with
better chances to win in the general elections, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Parties to Decide on Abacha's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's five political parties
are expected to decide at their national conventions this week on
the controversial issue of adopting Sani Abacha as their
consensus presidential candidate, media reports said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The parties reportedly received an instruction from the
government earlier this month, urging them to hold their national
conventions not later than this week.
</P>
<P>
The parties declined the order at first, as the national
assembly election is near on April 25, but reports said they might
have given in to pressure now.
</P>
<P>
The National Center Party of Nigeria has announced that it
will hold its national convention Saturday in Owerri, on which a
presidential candidate will be adopted.
</P>
<P>
The United Nigeria Congress Party, which saw landslide
victories in elections under the transition to civil rule program
so far, will hold its national convention Thursday in Kaduna, the
Sunday Punch newspaper said. But another newspaper, the Sunday
Tribune, said the convention is scheduled to be held on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The other parties, the Democratic Party of Nigeria, the
Congress for National Consensus and the Grassroot Democratic
Movement (GDM) will all have their national conventions Saturday,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Less than four months left from the August 1 presidential elections,
all the five parties have not announced their candidates, hence
strengthening the wide suspicion that they have a hidden agenda
of adopting General Abacha as their consensus candidate.
</P>
<P>
Two politicians, Alhaji Momammed Yusufu and Tunji Braithwaite,
have expressed their wish to run on the platform of the GDM, but
the party has not decided whom it will accept.

BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Outlook, China's leading weekly
news magazine, will include an editorial tomorrow, hailing the
establishment of a favorable environment to encourage people to
tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
The editorial stresses that Premier Zhu Rongji's call for every
member of the State Council to assiduously practice truthfulness
could be adopted as a requirement for the country's gigantic work
force of public servants.
</P>
<P>
Full and genuine implementation of the goal will be an arduous
task, which will be highly to both the State and the people when
accomplished, according to the editorial.
</P>
<P>
The editorial also stresses that those caught telling lies
should be punished in full accordance with the law and with total
disregard for social status.
</P>
<P>
The editorial stresses that those failing to adhere to the
principle of seeking truth from facts, the ideological line of the
Communist Party of China, are unqualified to work as public
servants or enjoy membership in the CPC.

Sundari tree, the main variety of the trees in the forest, has
been seriously attacked by the killer disease which eats up the
tree from the top downwards.
</P>
<P>
The Sundarbans mangrove forest is located near Khulna district,
about 320 km southwest of Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
Forty percent of the 5,800-square-km forest fringing the Bay of
Bengal is already affected by the "top-dying disease," according
to other press reports.
</P>
<P>
If a way to stop the disease from spreading is not found, the
Sundari tree may be extinct in the near future, the newspaper
said, quoting botanists.
</P>
<P>
But the causes of the disease are yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to stop the disease, scientists have begun a
three-year project funded by the British government's Overseas
Development Administration to monitor the forest.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Development Program also conducted four
years of research on the Sundarbans but failed to detect the
causes of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Increased salinity in the local rivers caused by withdrawal of
Ganges water of Farakka Barrage might by one reason for spreading
the disease, the Bangladesh Development Research Center said.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) also mentioned
high salinity as the cause of the destruction of Sundari trees.
</P>
<P>
Salinity of rivers like Jamuna, Ichhamoti, Kobadak, Kholpetua,
Raimongol, Malancha and Mongla flowing by the Sundarbans was up to
10 times the normal level, according to the BWDB.
</P>
<P>
That abnormally high level of salinity is causing not only the
top-dying disease but also destroying the seeds on the ground,
experts said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Sundari trees are used to growing mainly in the areas
washed by the tide, and now saline water remains stagnant for a
long time, preventing the growth of the plants, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
It is fungal disease which has caused the top-dying disease to
spread, according to Prof. M. Abdur Rahman of Forestry and Wood
Technology Department of the Khulna University. However, the type
of fungus could not be determined now, he said.
</P>
<P>
The affected trees should be cut down to protect the healthy
ones in the area, some forest officials suggested.
</P>
<P>
Foreign experts have also been contacted and technological
assistance sought to find out the causes of the disease and save
the Sundarbans from extinction, the newspaper added.

<HEADLINE> 3,000 Zambian Copper Miners to Lose Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- At least 3,000 employees from
Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) are ear-marked for
retrenchment as the state-owned mining conglomerate privatizes
its divisions, Sunday Times of Zambia reported.
</P>
<P>
In the same exercise, the mining company will not renew the
contracts for expatriate workers as well as selected jobs held by
Zambians, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Paul Kafumbe, President of Mineworkers Union of
Zambia (MUZ), as saying in an interview Saturday that he was
aware that 3,000 miners will be retrenched, but his union is
negotiating with ZCCM to keep the numbers low, preferably 1,000
workers.
</P>
<P>
He welcomed the decision by ZCCM not to renew contracts of
expatriate workers as Zambia has a lot of well-qualified
engineers to adequately man the mines.
</P>
<P>
With several divisions privatized, ZCCM labor force stands at
an estimated 38,000 employees from the previous 65,000 before the
privatization of the country's biggest foreign exchange earner
which started two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Though not stating the exact number of employees to be laid
off, ZCCM senior official Sam Equamo told the paper Saturday that
the company is currently reducing the number of employees at the
head office and the operations center since the two units will
have little or no role to play when other units are privatized.
</P>
<P>
Most contracts for expatriates and Zambians will not be
renewed in the same program of reducing labor, said Equamo
without confirming whether the contracts of expatriate workers
will be renewed or not.
</P>
<P>
There are Zambians on contract as well as expatriates. So
when their contracts expire, the management will come in to
determine whether they will need their services or not, according
to Equamo.

<HEADLINE> Red Tides Cost About Nine Million US Dollars Losses in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 12 (Xinhua) -- About two-thirds of 1,500 fish
farmers in Hong Kong have been affected by red tides which
resulted in a direct estimated economic losses of 70 million HK
dollars (8.97 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers reported here Sunday that the red tides first
emerged in mid-March and then spread widely on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The papers quoted Wong Yung-kan, chairman of the Hong Kong Fish
Culture Association, as saying "unlike previous tides, which were
over in three or four days, this year it has fast spread out."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Agriculture and Fisheries Department
has provided farm owners with emergency aid subsidies since the
red tides occurred.
</P>
<P>
According to a local expert, the red tides, known as
micro-organisms, bred tremendously fast when the water temperature
rose to a certain level.
</P>
<P>
They breed so fast that their number can double in an hour.
During the breeding process, they acquire a tremendous volume of
oxygen and release toxic substances which suffocate fish in the
farms, the expert added.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 12 (Xinhua) -- A deaf-mute worker in Fushun
city, in northeast China's Liaoning Province, started his own
business after being laid-off, and then employed a dozen other
laid-off workers, eight of whom are disabled persons.
</P>
<P>
Lu Zhenshan, 56, was laid off 14 years ago by a chemical
factory, as was his deaf-mute wife.
</P>
<P>
In the years that followed he made a living by repairing motor
vehicles, until he had saved up enough to start his own business.
</P>
<P>
In August 1996, with the assistance of the local government, he
set up his own company dealing in telecommunication facilities.
</P>
<P>
Unable to speak or hear, Lu relies on quality products, a good
reputation and talented staff for his success.
</P>
<P>
Besides the facts that he pays taxes to the state and
re-employs laid-off workers, Lu's usefulness as a citizen extends
to never hesitating to help other disabled people.

COLOMBO, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga Sunday called for peace in her ethnic conflict-torn
country and said the celebration of the New Year was a "strong
unifying thread in the fabric of relationship between the
Sinhalese and Tamil people."
</P>
<P>
The majority Sinhalese community and the minority Tamils in Sri
Lanka celebrate their common New Year on Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In her message to the nation on the New Year, Kumaratunga said:
"the message of the new year is that we must end the war by
unifying our fractured land. This is what our brave combatants are
fighting for."
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has long been plagued by problems between the
Sinhalese and Tamil-- the two major ethnic groups in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) has been fighting a
war against the government for a separate Tamil state in the north
and east of the country since 1983. The government says at least
50,000 people have been killed in the war.
</P>
<P>
"We must go forward on the path of peace," the president said
in her message.
</P>
<P>
"Our objective is to create a society in which members of all
communities can live with honor and security while retaining their
unique identities," she said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Returns From U.S. Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
returned here Sunday from a four-day official visit to the United
States, which he described as "fruitful."
</P>
<P>
In his arrival statement, Ramos said his visit had brought to
the American people and the world a message "about what we
Filipinos are proud of, and what we as a nation stand for."
</P>
<P>
In his discussions with President Bill Clinton and other U.S.
officials, Ramos said, he stressed that the Philippine government
will play a proactive role in ensuring peace and stability in the
Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
"This role means the Philippines' active involvement in efforts
to find peaceful solutions to the situation in Cambodia, the
Korean peninsula and elsewhere," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines, which currently holds the chairmanship of the
Standing Committee of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN), the ASEAN Region Forum and the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting,
has a special responsibility to advance cooperation and build
confidence among the countries in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Ramos also met officials of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, as well as U.S.
businessmen to seek more financial assistance and foreign
investments.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the Philippine economy has fared well and is posed
to return to sustainable growth.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines' exit from the IMF supervision -- under 22 IMF
programs over the last 35 years -- last month is "a clear signal
of the economy's new-found strength," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, in his meeting with Clinton, Ramos failed to find
immediate solutions to two key issues -- the return of two
Philippine church bells seized by the American forces at the end
of the Philippine-American War in 1904, and the increase of
benefits for the Filipino veterans who fought with American troops
in World War II.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said efforts will continue to secure the return of at
least one of the two bells.
</P>
<P>
He added that Clinton also assured him of his "strong personal
effort" to have one of the bells returned to the Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Announces Major Lay-offs in State-owned Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's Ministry of Labor, War
Invalids and Social Affairs has announced major lay-offs at both
state-owned and foreign-invested companies due to the regional
monetary crisis, Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
8 percent of the work force at state-owned companies and 11
percent of the employees at foreign-invested companies have been
cut, said VNA.
</P>
<P>
Industry, agriculture and construction -- the three biggest
economic sectors -- had laid-off 16 percent, 12 percent and eight
percent of their workers respectively.
</P>
<P>
A sharp drop in the cost of labor in financially stricken
countries like South Korea and Thailand has made many foreign
companies reduce or postpone their orders with Vietnamese firms
and reduce investment.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted at 1,855 businesses found substantial drops
in export orders in sectors such as garment and footwear, and
showed 747 of the firms cannot find enough work for their
employees.
</P>
<P>
Labor experts say the number of the jobless people may swell to
as many as 80,000 nationwide. Some 53,000 people have been jobless
for years, Vietnam Courier Weekly quoted sources from the ministry
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Some companies have tried to avoid lay-offs by reducing working
hours, shifting them to other jobs, granting extended vacations
and reducing foreign staff.
</P>
<P>
But experts fear the shut-down of the state-owned enterprises
with protracted losses are likely to make unemployment worse.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Might Pull out From INRO: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia might pull out of
the International Natural Rubber Organization (INRO) if Thailand
does so, its Primary Industries Minister said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Lim Keng Yaik said Malaysia is considering doing so because
both countries share the sentiment that the rubber consumer
countries are being very unfair towards the producer countries,
the Malaysian national news agency Bernama reported.
</P>
<P>
He said the question arose after a recent INRO meeting at which
Thailand expressed dissatisfaction with the consistent drop of
world natural rubber prices in the light of the regional economic
downturn.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia had actually wanted to withdraw its membership from
the organization two years ago but delayed doing so in the "spirit
of ASEAN," he told reporters after chairing a party meeting in
Johor Baharu, southern Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is the world's third largest rubber producing country
after Thailand and Indonesia. It produces one million tons of
natural rubber annually, about 800,000 of which is exported to
consumer countries. But Malaysia also imports some 400,000 tons
annually from its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The INRO, set up in 1978, brings together six rubber producer
countries, which are third world countries, and 21 rubber consumer
countries including those from Europe, and the United States and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
It serves to stabilize rubber prices by regulating the demand
and supply of rubber in the international market.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Top Leaders Meet Over Mayor's Detention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Iran's top leaders met Saturday
evening to discuss the detention of Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein
Karbaschi on charge of embezzlement, an Iranian conservative
newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The English-language daily Tehran Times quoted a reliable
source as saying that President Mohammad Khatami, Parliament
Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, Chief Justice Ayatollah Mohammad
Yazdi, Chairman of the State Expediency Council and former
president Hashemi Rafsanjani reviewed the Karbaschi case on late
Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on condition of anonymity, the source said that
the leaders reached "some sort of conclusion" on Karbaschi's
detention, but adding that "it's not the right time to
reveal exactly what they have decided."
</P>
<P>
He said that the results of their discussion would be delivered
to Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who summoned
them on Wednesday, asking them to review the case in order to
quell a growing power struggle in the country.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted another source as ruling out the possibility
that Karbaschi would be freed from prison.

Karbaschi was detained on April 4 for a huge financial scandal,
which was rejected by Karbaschi himself. Pro-Khatami factions
termed it political revenge against the mayor for his support
for Khatami in the presidential elections last May.
</P>
<P>
Enjoying Karbaschi's desperate support in the presidential
elections, Khatami won a landslide victory over Nateq-Nouri, a
conservative leader, who won support from Yazdi.
</P>
<P>
However, Gholamhussein Mohseni, chief of the special judicial
bench in charge of investigating violations of civil employees,
rejected the allegations that Karbaschi's case was politically
motivated, saying that "we do not seek political goals but
deliver justice."
</P>
<P>
He added that Karbaschi was detained according to legal
procedure and would be tried openly.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's LTTE Seeks Talks With Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE) has told the Jaffna city Catholic Bishop B.T.
Saundaranayagam it is ready to negotiate a solution to the ethnic
conflict through a third party mediation but the Sri Lankan
government must take the initiative, a Tamil newspaper from north
of the country reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A Jaffna-based Tamil Daily Udayan said the Bishop met several
LTTE leaders for extensive discussions on humanitarian, social and
political issues when he visited the rebel-controlled areas in the
northern Wanni district recently.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE leaders who refused to accept the Sri Lankan
government's devolution package as a basis for talks, pointed out
that even the two main political parties -- the People's Alliance
and the United National Party were at odds on the package, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The devolution package announced by the government in August,
1995, aims to resolve the long-standing ethnic crisis in the
country. It contains proposals for redemarcation of the north and
east provinces and extension of more powers to Tamils in these
provinces.
</P>
<P>
However the Sri Lankan government announced to ban the LTTE on
January 26 this year. The decision came one day after a powerful
truck bomb exploded in Kandy, the ancient Sri Lankan capital 115
km of Colombo, killing 12 people and damaging the holiest place of
worship of Sri Lankan Buddhists, the Tooth relic Temple.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting for a war against the government for
a separate Tamil state in the north and east of the country since
1983. the government said at least 50,000 people have been killed
in the war.

DAR ES SALAAM, April 12 (Xinhua) -- More than 90 miners have
been buried by landslide in a tanzanite mine in Arusha in north
Tanzania following a downpour on Thursday night, Dar es Salaam

The miners are feared dead as they have gone 300 meters deep
in the pits and the whole mining area is flooded after prolonged
rainfall, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Arusha Regional Commissioner Daniel ole Njoolay confirmed

equipment to excavate soil are urgently needed.

leading to it have been washed away by floods.
</P>
<P>
"It's still raining," he said.
</P>

The regional commissioner said that he has formed a rescue
team consisting of government officials, police and fire brigades

<P>
BANGKOK, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Thai Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanhaeminda will tell the international community that Thailand
is committed to reforms when he attends a meeting of finance
ministers in Washington next week.
</P>
<P>
Finance ministers from 22 countries will participate in the
meeting which will seek global cooperation in tackling the crisis
in the monetary market.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin said he will convince the international community that
Thailand is adopting the right measures to solve its economic
problems.
</P>
<P>
G-7 countries, Tarrin said, had earlier agreed with the
measures being implemented by Thailand to cure its ailing economy.

He said he would like the world to see that Thailand was now on
the right path to economic recovery.

"This meeting could be another stage for us to rebuild world
confidence in our economy," said Tarrin, quoted by Sunday's

Tarrin dismissed reports that Thailand has given more
importance to the Western than Asian countries, particularly

The meeting will also discuss measures to make operations and
information distribution of financial institutions transparent,
measures to strengthen the finance system and the role of each
country in tackling financial crises, Tarrin said.

<P>
HARARE, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Thirteen Zimbabweans were killed
and 158 others injured in road accidents since the beginning of
the Easter holiday on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the same period last year, there were eight deaths and 30
injuries in road accidents, the Sunday Mail reported.
</P>
<P>
Police Press and Public Relations Officer Joe Manyakaidze said
that most of the accidents were due to speeding, lack of
attention on the part of the drivers and defective vehicles which
were being used to ferry people from different areas.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Manyakaidze as saying that about 101 vehicles
had so far been impounded and 20 tickets issued for drunken
driving.
</P>
<P>
Although this year's figures were higher than that of last
year, the staff officer for the National Highway Patrol, Chief
Superintendent Martin Simbi said, this year's Good Friday was one
of the safest due to a heavy police presence on the roads,
favorable weather and a changing attitude in a growing number of
drivers toward reckless driving.
</P>
<P>
Simbi urged those who are traveling to remain cautious on the
roads as they make their way back at the end of the holiday
tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> Progress Made in Somalia's Reconciliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 12 (Xinhua) -- progress has been made in
Somalia's reconciliation and reconstruction efforts, the local
newspaper Sunday Nation quoted Somali faction leader Hussein
Aideed as reporting.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the newspaper Saturday, the 36-year old
Somali faction leader said that the Somali people were tired of
fighting and the number of people crusading for peace and
national reconciliation was increasing day by day.
</P>
<P>
"Things have changed, we are no longer shooting each other.
These days we (factional leaders) sit and dine together," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Aideed said, "When I was coming to Kenya, I shared a flight
with Ali Mahdi Mohammed, Osman Hassan Ali and Mohammed Afrah.
That is how close we have become."
</P>
<P>
He called on African states to support his country in the
struggle to reclaim its lost glory and reverse the havoc caused
by seven years of civil strife.
</P>
<P>
The Somali faction leader blamed the disintegration of the
horn-of-Africa country on interference from the West and former
Somali leader Siad Barre's divide-and-rule tactics during his 21
years of tyrannical rule.
</P>
<P>
He is among the four faction leaders from Somalia's Banadir
region who arrived here last Tuesday and met Kenyan President
Daniel arap Moi last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Like his father (the late Farrah Aideed), Aideed said, he is
prepared to die if this is the inevitable price to pay to end the
disintegration of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
"If we did not have faith in the reconciliation efforts by
Kenya and our other friends, we would not be wasting time
attending peace meetings," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference last Wednesday, Aideed said,"We
are determined more than ever before to pursue the path of peace
in order to resolve our political and other differences."
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that they were in the process of establishing a
central authority within the Banadir region including Mogadishu
and its environs, and they had invited President Moi to perform
the official reopening of seaport and airport in Mogadishu.

<HEADLINE> China-Made Game Software Gaining More Lights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- ``Iron Armor Storm'', software
for a computer game developed in China, made its debut here
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
At a launching ceremony, officials from China's Press and
Publications Administration (PPA) said that the software,
developed by Object Software Co. (OSC), has caught up with the
international level in terms of programming and designing.
</P>
<P>
The development of the software costs two million yuan, a
considerable amount for a domestic software program. An English
version of the program will be issued overseas in a month.
</P>
<P>
The company hopes to sell 10,000 items of the software in the
Taiwan and Southeast Asian markets, and 30,000-40,000 in the
European and American regions, according to OSC's chief designer,
who is also the executive manager of the company, one of the
leading specialized game software developers in China.
</P>
<P>
The development growth of China's copyrighted game softwares
has been fairly slow, said the PPA officials, due to a flood of
imported programs and software, lack of domestic financing and
copyright piracy.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that China developed 1,250 varieties
of software in 1997, only six percent of which were game CDs. At
the same time, imported game products totaled 110 varieties.
</P>
<P>
The PPA is reportedly working on issuing publishing licenses
for electronic publication to some enterprises. This right has been
reserved for publishing houses so far.

<P>
MANILA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- About 21,000 hectares of forest
land, plantation and graze lands in the Philippines have been
destroyed by fires since January this year, exceeding the
country's 15,000 hectare annual average rate of forest fire
destruction.
</P>
<P>
The trend shows an escalating incidence of forest fires since
the start of 1998 compared to the decreased incidence of forest
fires in 1996 and 1997, the Star newspaper said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the Philippines will still have to brace
for more forest fires as El Nino is expected to stay for more than
a month longer.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the 1997-98 El Nino will continue up to May
or early June, thus delaying the onset of the rainy season in the
country for weeks.
</P>
<P>
Annually, the paper said, forest fires cost the government
close to 80 million pesos (about 2 million U.S. dollars) worth of
plantations and reforestation areas.
</P>
<P>
This, according to the Department of Environment and Natural
Resources, represents 12.49 percent of the national deforestation
rate of 118,000 hectares annually.
</P>
<P>
Eight provinces in the Philippines have been hit by forest
fires since January. On the island of Palawan, fires have damaged
15,000 hectares of forest in a month. New fires have been reported
across the country.

BEIJING, April 12 (xinhua) -- China will impose a new fishing
ban in the Yellow and East China seas this year to protect fish
resources, the Agriculture Ministry's Fishery Bureau announced
today.
</P>
<P>
The ban was approved by the State Council and is similar to the

increase of 37.8 percent for the autumn high water season of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The new fishing ban increases the length of the no-fishing
season from two months to three months.
</P>
<P>
It will exclude trawlers and net catches by sailboats, from
midnight of June 15 to midnight of September 15, from an area
extending from 26 degrees to 35 degrees north latitude, and from

but only 89.10 million dollars were earned in the first half of
the year from July to December, which was over 13 percent lower
than the target for that period, press reports said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The country's tanning industry, which requires about 180
million square feet of raw hides and skin, usually collects about
72 million square feet each year (more than 40 percent of the
total requirement) during Eid, according to the Bangladesh
Tanneries Association.
</P>
<P>
But most local tannery owners could not collect enough hides
and skin of the sacrificial cattle this year during the festival
of Eid-ul-Azha which falls on April 8, due to fund constraint. And
about 50 percent of the tannery owners could not purchase hides
and skin because of lack of fund, although the prices of hides and
skin were very low, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh Bank, the nation's central bank, has advised the
commercial banks not to give fresh loan before Eid to defaulters.
Since 1990, commercial banks have provided over 12 billion taka
(about 260.9 million dollars) to the leather sector, of which 7.72
billion taka (about 167.8 million dollars), or more than 63
percent of the total credit, have now become bad loan.
</P>
<P>
As the local buyers failed to collect the raw hides and skin, a
huge quantity of raw hides and skin remained unsold till the Eid
night on April 8, and was likely to be smuggled to India,
according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
The country has banned export of raw hides and skin of animals
since 1990 to protect the interests of local tanneries and leather
goods producers.
</P>
<P>
The target set for this year was lower that the targeted 260
million dollars for the 1996-97 fiscal year, when actual export
earnings amounted to 166 million dollars only. The country earned
202 million dollars from leather export in the 1994-95 fiscal
year, and 235 million dollars in the 1995-96 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Leather export is a major foreign exchange earner of the
country.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Earnings From Leather Export Decline </HEADLINE>

DHAKA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's earnings from leather
export has declined over the last few years due to lack of proper

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Indonesian Govt Dealing With Food Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- In the face of food shortage
threat, the Indonesian government is taking steps to introduce a
better technology system to accelerate production of basic food
crops, particularly staple rice, soybean and corn.
</P>
<P>
According to Agriculture Minister Justike S. Baharsyah, the
technology system, named Sistem Usaha Pertanian (SUP), is aimed to
enable the use of less arable land for growing crops. It includes
the use of high-yielding and insect-resisting seeds that can be
planted in swamp area.
</P>
<P>
"By applying SUP we can, for example, produce five to eight
tons of unhusked rice for one hectare of rice field in swamp
area," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Government officials and agriculture experts have suggested
that use of swamps for rice fields has become increasingly
important in the face shrinking arable land in Java, the most
populous island in the country, where 30,000 to 40,000 hectares of
agricultural land are turned into industrial or residential zones
each year.
</P>
<P>
So far, Indonesia has applied the SUP system to corn on West
Nusa Tenggara province and worked well, officials said.
</P>
<P>
But, Baharsyah held that the use of better technology alone is
not enough to boost production. To encourage farmers to produce
more, there has to be a partnership between farmers and business
people, who can help the funding and further process the farmers'
agricultural products, she added.
</P>
<P>
In the corn cultivation area in West Nusa Tenggara province,
the ministers said there are companies that are specialized in
providing corn seeds, a bank that offers credit line and a company
that is ready buy the farmers' output.
</P>
<P>
"Under such a cooperation framework, farmers will have the
resources to plant and know that there will be a company to buy
their output," said Picko Nyotosetiadi, director of PT. Citra
Gemini Mulya, a company that buys and markets the output.
</P>
<P>
The Agricultural Ministry has also cultivated 30,000 hectares
of swamp area rice field in South Sumatra province. It plans to
expand the use of swamp area in the province to 270,000 hectares
over the next five years, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
The government's effort to boost basic food production has come
amid warnings from international agencies that the country may
face a record food deficit as a result of reduced harvests. In the
meantime, Indonesia's ability to buy food from overseas has been
reduced because of the current monetary crisis.
</P>
<P>
A mission sent by the UN Food and Agricultural Organization
(FAO) and the World Food Program (WFP) recently estimated that
approximately 7.5 million poor Indonesians in 15 provinces may
face acute food shortages during the coming dry season (from April
to September).
</P>
<P>
Because of the steep production fall, Indonesia is expected to
face a record import requirement of about 3.5 million tons of rice
during the 1998-99 fiscal year (starting April 1), economic
analysts predicted.
</P>
<P>
Although Indonesia is rich in natural resources, it needs to
import at least 1.2 million tons of sugar, 1.3 million tons of
corn and 1 million tons of soybean each year. The country imported
1 million tons of rice last year.
</P>
<P>
Besides these commodities, Indonesia, with a population of
202.5 million, also imports meat, milk and milk products, fruits
and other goods to meet its demand.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia achieved rice self-sufficiency for the first time in
1984, but unfortunately it did not last long due to a prolonged
dry spell. Since early 1990s, the country has again become a net
rice importer.

<HEADLINE> hke041210 -News Analysis: How Successful Ramos' Washington Trip? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
returned home Sunday after a four-day official visit to the United
States, which the president described as "very successful."
</P>
<P>
Ramos' trip to Washington, which was made less than three
months before his six-year term ends, was criticized by opposition
parties for "wasting money" when the country is passing through a
regional financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
However, the administration said the visit is necessary since
the country is badly in need of foreign investments to stimulate
the economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
In that sense, analysts said, Ramos' visit is "successful" as
it has helped boost investors' confidence in the Philippine
economy.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Ramos had met World Bank President James
Wolfensohn, International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director
Michel Camdessus, and U.S. businessmen, including W. Wayne Booker,
vice chairman of Ford Motor Company.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to dissipate fears of dis-continuation of reforms
after the May 11 presidential election in the Philippines, Ramos
assured them that the Philippines' economic policies would not be
reversed, regardless of who wins the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
In response to the assurance, the IMF, World bank officials and
U.S. businessmen had pledged their assistance to the Philippines,
which is recovering from the nine-month old financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, the World Bank and the Philippines signed an
agreement on the bank's 79 million dollars special loan to the
Southeast Asian country. Ramos and Wolfensohn attended the signing
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The money, part of the 1-billion-dollar aid package by the
world bank to the Philippines, will be used for three projects
aimed to increase the income of the poor and provide basic
services, especially those in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Although the Philippines exited from the IMF supervision of its
economy on March 27, the monetary body agreed to provide the
country with a stand-by credit of 1.4 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
For the part of Ford Motor Company, it also announced during
Ramos' trip that it will put up a 330-million-dollar integrated
car manufacturing plant in the Philippines, a strong signal of
confidence that U.S. manufacturers have in the country.
</P>
<P>
But compared with Ramos' campaign for foreign investments, his
visit seems not as successful as the Philippine leader had
expected, observers said.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Ramos and U.S. President held brief talks with
agreement to strengthen economic ties, but failed to solve
disputes over the return of two Philippine church bells and the
benefits that Filipino veterans who had fought with the American
forces in the World War ii want to get.
</P>
<P>
The two church bells were originally installed in the village of
Balangiga on the island of Samar, the Philippines. They were used
to signal the villagers.
</P>
<P>
They were taken by the U.S. 11th Infantry in 1901 when the U.S.
troops captured the village and burned Balangiga to the ground and
killed every male over the age of 10 in retaliation on behalf of
the 9th Infantry. Later, the 11th Infantry took the two church
bells to Wyoming in 1904 when the troops were sent back to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said that Ramos' failure to resolve the
issues of the church bells and veterans' benefits has made his
trip less successful.

<HEADLINE> Peru Reduces Coca Acreage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Peruvian government has decided
to cut 28 percent of the country's coca growing area this year, in
a bid to eliminate drug production, a Peruvian official said on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The cut will bring down Peru's acreage of coca shrubs from the
present 69,000 hectares to 50,000 hectares by the end of 1998,
said Juan Gil, executive secretary of the Commission for the War
Against Drug Consuming.
</P>
<P>
The cultivation of coca, whose dried leaves can be used to
produce cocaine, could be finally wiped out in the country, Gil
said.
</P>
<P>
"Our country will have completely substituted in less than 10
years this kind of cultivation with other crops, such as rice,
coffee, cocoa, and palmetto, as a result of the implementation of
the National Program for Alternate Development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gil noted that with proper registration, only a small area of
coca shrubs will be kept to meet the needs of the medicine and the
traditional use by the Andean population.
</P>
<P>
However, Gil said that the substitution plan must go together
with social programs that can give farmers necessary mechanism to
market their new produce.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this goal, the Peruvian government has decided to
pump money into state institutions in coca-producing areas to help
farmers adapt themselves to the change.

BANGKOK, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's export value in March
dropped to 198 billion baht (5.2 billion U.S. dollars) as the baht
grew stronger against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The export value for February and January was 220 billion baht
(5.8 billion dollars) and 219 billion baht (5.7 billion dollars)
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's trade surplus, however, surged to 138 billion baht
(3.6 billion dollars) in the first quarter of this year, Customs
Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
This was the third month that Thailand registered a trade
surplus.
</P>
<P>
Import value for the first quarter of this year fell to 156.9
billion baht (4.1 billion dollars) against 169 billion baht (4.4
billion dollars) in February and 173.69 billion baht (4.6 billion
dollars) in January. Sunday's Nation newspaper quoted the

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Central Bank to Ease Credit Squeeze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Central Bank is
considering steps to improve conditions by restructuring the debts
of state banks and easing loan classification rules for financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank is showing signs of flexibility amid growing
concern about lack of liquidity in the monetary market, according
to its officials.
</P>
<P>
But any reclassification of non-performing loans will be done
on a case-by-case basis, the officials said in remarks published
by major newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Relaxing the classification rules would reduce pressure on
financial institutions to set aside provisions and thus free up
funds for credit expansion.
</P>
<P>
Businesses have been finding it almost impossible to obtain
loans as banks are concerned about possible bad debts and the need
to set aside ever-growing sums as provisions.
</P>
<P>
The officials said bank regulators would meet with the Thai
Bankers' Association next week to discuss ways to ease competition
for deposits amid mounting efforts by many banks to offer high
deposit interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank was also studying how to restructure the
funding structure of the financial institutions development fund.
</P>
<P>
The government has said it would issue long-term bonds to
reduce funding costs of the fund, which in turn would create room
for interest rates to ease.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank is expected to gradually ease interest rates
through the bond repurchase market.

</P>
<P>
Industry sources said that the value of vehicle export in
March this year totaled 526.2 million U.S. dollars, up 83.77
percent from March 1997.

BUENOS AIRES -- With exports worth 1.7 billion U.S. dollars and
imports 2.24 billion dollars, Argentina's trade deficit in
February this year was about 540 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
That brought the country's trade deficit in the first two

started in last July.
</P>
<P>
The bank also forecast that the 1998 current account deficit
would be equivalent to 6 percent of GDP and exports are expected
to grow by 4.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China City to Use More Overseas Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Shenyang, an old heavy
industrial base and capital of northeast China's Liaoning
province, plans to seek more overseas funds to revitalize its
state businesses in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Xu Wencai, secretary of the city committee of the Communist
Party of China (CPC), said over 37 percent of the city's 224 large
and medium-sized state enterprises had used overseas investment by
the end of last year, which he said, "was not enough to turn
around those Shenyang state businesses operating in the red,"
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Known as the "cradle of Chinese modern industry" in the 1950s
and 1960s, the city now boasts over 5,500 state-run businesses,
many of which have been operating in the red since China introduced
the market competition to its industries beginning the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Economists say that factors attributing to the poor performance
of those businesses are two-fold: out-of-date management and
unpopular products.

<HEADLINE> Mexico May Need to Import 14 Million Tons of Grain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Mexico will need to import
some 14 million tons of grain in the wake of a poor production of
corn, beans, wheat and sorghum this year, a senior farmhand union
official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Mexican newspaper, Uno Mas Uno,
Alvaro Lopez Ramos, general secretary of the National Agricultural
Workers Union (UNTA), attributed this year's deficit in the grain
production to the drought caused by the climate phenomenon El Nino.
</P>
<P>
The UNTA leader added that the country's central and northern
regions suffered the most in the drought.
</P>
<P>
The National Water Commission revealed that the water in the
country's 137 main reservoirs available for irrigation is 15,713
million cubic meters, representing merely 33 percent of their
capacity.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from other similar farm labor unions echoed the UNTA
leader's opinion, complaining that the government's agricultural
policies are insufficient and ineffective.
</P>
<P>
They demanded more resources for the agricultural sector and
revision of policies for rural development.

<HEADLINE> China to Invest Heavily in Information Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- China plans to inject 450 billion
yuan (54.2 billion US dollars) in the construction of
communications facilities in the three years to 2000, according to
today's Business Weekly of China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Projects will include mobile communications, communication
networks using optical fibers and data communication systems for
use in financial business, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"The construction of 14 optical fiber trunk lines is well under
way and will be completed by the end of this year or at the
beginning of next year, two years ahead of schedule," it said.
</P>
<P>
A large portion of the investment will be used to import
equipment for capacity expansion, creating an enormous market for
foreign manufacturers of data optical fiber transmission equipment.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors are becoming increasingly excited about
China's electronics and information market, which generated 60
billion US dollars in sales in 1997 and is expected to be worth
100 billion dollars in 2000, it said.
</P>
<P>
The country will need 20 million personal computers and between
30 million and 40 million cellular phones by the year 2000, the
newspaper quoted economists as predicting.
</P>
<P>
Computer software industry and integrated circuit sector need
huge investments since domestic manufacturers' market share is
still small, they said.
</P>
<P>
Training, technological upgrading and replacement of antiquated
equipment also are priorities in the new round of investment, they
added.

<HEADLINE> hke041201 -News Analysis: Asian Airlines Feel Bites of Financial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Asian airlines that expanded
rapidly during recent years have begun to feel the pinch of the
protracted financial crisis in the region.
</P>
<P>
In a surprisingly frank admission of its ailing financial
health, Philippine Airlines (PAL) likened itself in a recent
communique to a "sick man" facing an "uncertain future."
</P>
<P>
"Due to the recent currency crisis in the region, Philippine
Airlines is in serious financial trouble and will not survive
unless we take drastic steps," PAL president Jose Antonio Garcia
said in the communique issued to its 14,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
Garcia said the airline must shrink its operations by reducing
its fleet, cutting its workforce, closing stations and reducing
flight frequencies.
</P>
<P>
Last month, PAL announced it would indefinitely postpone orders
for nine aircraft, part of its 4-billion-U.S.-dollar modernization
program starting in 1996. These include six Boeing 747-400s, which
were scheduled to be delivered in the next three years, and three
Airbuses.
</P>
<P>
PAL's financial difficulty was merely the tip of the iceberg.
Many other major airlines in the region have already suffered the
fall-out effects of the Asia's financial woes.
</P>
<P>
Garuda Indonesia has reportedly defaulted two installment on
loans for two Airbus airplanes.
</P>
<P>
Two other Southeast Asian carriers -- Thai Airways
International and South Korea's Asiana -- are asking for delays of
planes to be delivered this year.
</P>
<P>
Some airlines have already begun to make arrangements for
selling and leasing back part of their fleet as a means to raise
money and to stay in the air.
</P>
<P>
Asian airlines, having returned to profitability during the
past several years, have been predicted better days ahead as
passenger volumes were expected to surge over the coming years as
a result of booming economies.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the currency crisis roiling the region since last
July, most of the major Asian carriers were poised for a big
takeoff to compete with the world's leading carriers.
</P>
<P>
Many Asian airlines have gone into multi-billion-dollar
modernization programs in anticipation of a continued economic
boom in the region, which has been seen as a big market by both
Boeing Co. and Airbus Industries.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Airlines launched in 1996 a 4-billion-dollar
modernization plan under which 3.2 billion dollars will be
allocated to purchase 36 new planes. The PAL's new fleet would
have been one of the youngest in the region.
</P>
<P>
One year later, Korean Airlines (KAL) approved plans to
introduce at least 140 new aircraft to its fleet by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many new airline companies were born in the region,
including Korea's Asiana Airline and a second national carrier for
Thailand, the Angel Airlines.
</P>
<P>
But the downside came soon after the floatation of the Thai
baht last July which ignited the Asian currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
Because of a sharp drop in the Asian currencies against the
U.S. dollar, Asian airlines' costs surged since many of their
expenses, such as fuel and aircraft purchase, are paid in dollars.
And half of their revenues are in local currencies.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the currency crisis has dealt a severe blow to the
regional tourism industry whose growth mainly depends on tourists
within the region.
</P>
<P>
Because of the region's financial turmoil, Asia-Pacific nations
lost 12 million tourists in 1997 -- a loss likely to be repeated
in each of the next two years, according to a recent report from
the World Tourism Organization.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the revenues of the airlines have shrunk as
passenger volumes were drastically reduced.
</P>
<P>
More airlines, especially small domestic ones, may have to
cancel orders, defer deliveries or sell older planes as the
financial crisis continued to persist in the region, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
Due to economic slowdown in the region, it will take a long
time for Asian airlines to recover. And for most cash-strapped
airlines, just to survive this year will be a big achievement,
they predicted.

BUENOS AIRES, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Scot driver David Coulthard
claimed his first pole position in three years when he put his
McLaren Mercedes in top spot during Saturday's qualifying for the
Argentina Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
Coulthard clocked one minute 25.852 seconds round the slippery,
bumpy 2.646 mile circuit.
</P>
<P>
But instead of his teammate Mika Hakkinen, who has won the
opening two races of the season, lining up beside him on the front
row, he will make the dash to the first bend with the Ferrari of
Michael Schumacher.
</P>
<P>
The double world champion, revelling in the tricky conditions,
clocked 1:26.251.
</P>
<P>
Hakkinen could only manage third fastest, just ahead of the
other Ferrari of Eddie Irvine.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Jacques Villeneuve had to settle for the
fourth row. But his Williams teammate Heinz-Harald Frentzen, who
has consistently outraced him this season, was sixth fastest and
will line-up aside Ralf Schumacher in the Jordan.
</P>
<P>
A disappointed Damon Hill in the second Jordan was ninth
fastest. It was a bitter blow for the former champion who was
fifth fastest in the morning's unofficial practice session.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Hails Northern Ireland Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Egypt expressed welcome on Saturday
to a peace agreement on resolving conflicts in Northern Ireland
and voiced hope that it could serve as a model for making peace in
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told reporters that his
country is satisfied with the understanding reached by all the
parties involved in the Northern Ireland peace talks.
</P>
<P>
A peace agreement was signed on Friday by the British and Irish
governments and eight political parties concerned with the future
of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations with goodwill and keenness to make peace have
actually led to this result, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that any other parties can follow suit to achieve
the same positive results and that any other problems can be
solved in the same way.
</P>
<P>
"The Middle East peace talks are lacking this good will,
particularly vis-a-vis the Israeli stance on withdrawal from the
occupied Palestinian and Arab territories according to the
international resolutions," he said.
