<HEADLINE> Stock Averages Set High Standard / Ticker Talk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In the new math of the late-1990s stock market,  
the averages are way above the norm. 
</P>
<P>
	This strange statement probably doesn't sound very informative  
at first. But it goes a long way toward explaining why the stocks 
and stock mutual funds you own may be having so much trouble 
keeping up with the Dow Joneses. 
</P>
<P>
	The prominent stock market averages and indexes have all reached  
new milestones of late -- Dow Jones's 30 industrials at 10,000, the 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 at 1,300, and the Nasdaq composite index at 
2,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the way they are calculated, however, all these  
measures of market trends are dominated by a small group of big 
stocks that have been hogging most of the glory. By many broader 
gauges, the stock market has been losing ground lately, rather than 
climbing to new heights. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the last year, institutional favorites have vastly  
outperformed the broad list of stocks,'' notes Philip Roth, 
technical analyst at the brokerage firm of Morgan Stanley Dean 
Witter &AMP; Co. ``Non-institutional favorites have not only lagged 
badly, they have fallen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roth points out that the Value Line arithmetic index,  
encompassing about 1,700 stocks, posted a loss of 7.7 percent over 
a 12-month period through late March, while the S&AMP;P 500 was gaining 
18.2 percent and the Dow was rising 11.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	By numerous other measures, such as running tallies of the  
number of stock rising and falling each day in the New York Stock 
Exchange and Nasdaq markets, the market has been weakening for a 
year or more. In the last full week in March, 684 NYSE and Nasdaq 
issues made new 12-month lows, while only 228 hit new highs -- for a 
negative ratio of 3 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``The divergence between the average stock and the market  
averages has rarely been greater,'' observes the newsletter Dow 
Theory Forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	For anybody who wants to keep track of what is happening on Wall  
Street, this point is much more than just some statistical quibble. 
It's a key factor, for instance, in understanding why S&AMP;P 500 index 
funds have been so popular lately: They have produced performance 
that is far above average. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the gap between the averages and the average stock  
demonstrates how tricky it can be to try to base your own 
investment decisions on some perception of whether ``the market'' 
is overvalued or undervalued. 
</P>
<P>
	If there is no single trend story that covers all stocks now,  
it's illogical to expect all of them to react the same way when the 
pattern changes at some point in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	So it happens that right now you can see ``momentum'' investors  
jumping aboard the blue-chip and technology rockets, even as 
``value'' investors grimly hold on to depressed bargain buys that 
have gone nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``The realities of the marketplace dictate that you look at  
contrarian investments now,'' says Timothy Vick, who edits the 
newsletter Today's Value Investor. ``No amount of hyperbole or 
chants of 'this time it's different' can invalidate the methods by 
which you should judge an investment. 
</P>
<P>
	``You must decide for yourself in which camp you fall -- momentum  
or value. The stakes are high if you choose wrongly. More than 70 
percent of all stocks have fallen in price since March 1998.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No single market indicator can measure all the crosscurrents. So  
even if you invest in an index fund, the results you see with your 
money may be a long way from average.

<HEADLINE> Chemicals Could Create No-Mow Lawn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *MICHAEL PEARSON   	
</P>
<P>
	CARBONDALE, Ill. (AP) -- Dale Palscher doesn't just dislike  
mowing his lawn -- he hates it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll have the kids do it, the neighbors, my wife, I don't  
care,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not quite time for him to sell off his mower, but an  
emerging group of chemicals could someday take most of the mowing 
out of his yard work. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, golf course superintendents and sports field managers  
have used plant growth regulators to keep their greens trim. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea hasn't yet caught on with homeowners, in part because  
the products are hard to apply and have had a reputation for doing 
more damage than good if improperly used. 
</P>
<P>
	But newer, more foolproof versions of the products are entering  
the professional market, leading some to believe homeowners also 
could eventually buy something that would give them a thick, green, 
no-mow lawn. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a sure market like fertilizer,'' said Ken Diesburg,  
who studies turf grasses at Southern Illinois University in 
Carbondale. ``But at least one of the lawn-care companies is 
thinking about using it, which is a first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diesburg has been studying the active ingredient in a newly  
released professional product from Rhone Poulenc Ag Co., called 
Proxy. 
</P>
<P>
	He has found that the newest generation of growth regulators has  
more tolerance for mistakes and does less damage if improperly 
used. 
</P>
<P>
	Growth regulators, which began appearing in the 1980s, slow or  
stop grass growth by shifting the plants' hormonal balance, 
Diesburg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Proxy works by shifting the plant's growing energy from up to  
out. Instead of taller shoots, grass plants produce branches, 
making a thick turf that might need mowing just twice a summer, 
Diesburg said. 
</P>
<P>
	It works best on Kentucky bluegrass, the most popular grass for  
golf course fairways in much of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	However, current products require precise application. Although  
Proxy is more forgiving when people overlap areas when spraying it, 
it is still not easy to apply, Diesburg said. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Scotts Co., an Ohio-based manufacturer of lawn-care  
products, found additional factors standing in the way when it 
tried unsuccessfully to market its PGR growth regulator to 
consumers several years ago, said Scotts grass expert Ashton 
Ritchie. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of them enjoy taking care of the lawn, how it smells  
after they mow it, how it looks after they mow it. And people who 
don't mow don't tend to buy lawn care products, either,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, a growth regulator would be appealing to homeowners if  
manufacturers can overcome the technical hurdles, said Alan Marcus, 
director of the Iowa State University Center for Historical Studies 
of Technology and Science. 
</P>
<P>
	``People for whatever reason think they have too much to do and  
too little time to do it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Thompson Takes 3 Swimming Golds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Jenny Thompson had enough energy left for a  
third gold medal, if not a second world record. 
</P>
<P>
	That was good enough for Thompson to be chosen best female  
swimmer at the World Short-Course Championships Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The weary Thompson capped a grueling meet by winning the  
100-meter butterfly in 57.65 seconds. Her December 1998 time of 
56.90 is one of three world records she holds. 
</P>
<P>
	During the meet, Thompson also broke one world record -- in an  
event where she didn't win the gold medal, because she dropped out 
after the heats. 
</P>
<P>
	That same day, she won the 50-meter butterfly and 100 freestyle.  
After taking second in the 50 freestyle Saturday, she rebounded 
with her victory in the 100 butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am extremely tired from all the racing I've been doing, and  
it cost me,'' Thompson said. ``I was hoping to go a little faster 
and break the world record, but it wasn't there tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Looking ahead to the 2000 Olympics, Thompson said, ``One step at  
a time -- first the Pan Pacific this summer, then Sydney.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after Thompson's victory, two Japanese women did their  
best to overshadow her. 
</P>
<P>
	Mai Nakamura and Masami Tanaka sent their relay team off to a  
big early lead, and Japan broke the world record in the 400 medley 
relay. Tanaka already had swept all three individual breaststroke 
races, breaking one world record, and Nakamura took two of the 
three individual backstroke events. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meet's final race, Australia made amends for a  
disqualification in the men's 800 freestyle relay and broke the 
world record in the medley relay. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, world records fell in seven events. Each was worth  
$15,000 thanks to rewards offered for the first time by FINA, 
swimming's governing body. 
</P>
<P>
	Nakamura and Tanaka gave Japan a 2.7-second lead in the relay  
after 200 meters, and Ayari Aoyama and Sumika Minamoto finished off 
the victory in 3:57.62, beating the mark of 3:57.73 set by China in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia's men swam the medley relay in 3:29.88, breaking their  
2-year-old mark of 3:30.66. 
</P>
<P>
	The record came two days after the Australians were disqualified  
in the freestyle relay for not following their entry list order in 
the heats. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan finished with six golds after picking up three Sunday --  
the relay, Tanaka's victory in the 100 breaststroke and Nakamura's 
in the 200 backstroke, where she missed a world record by .4 
second. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson accounted for all three of the U.S. gold medals.  
</P>
<P>
	World long-course champion Kurt Grote led midway through the 200  
breaststroke, but faded and finished fifth at 2:09.47, compared to 
the winning time of 2:08.72 by Australia's Phil Rodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian Matthew Dunn was chosen best male swimmer of the  
meet. He won two of the three individual medleys after winning a 
duel in the 200 with Britain's James Hickman. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian Grant Hackett won the men's 1,500 freestyle at  
14:32.87, more than 12 seconds slower than his world record. 
</P>
<P>
	Slovakia's Martina Moravcova earned her second and third golds,  
winning the women's 200 individual medley and 200 freestyle within 
90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Others who became double gold medalists Sunday were Sweden's  
Lars Frolander, winner of the men's 100 freestyle; Britain's Mark 
Foster, who won the 50 butterfly, and Cuba's Rodolfo Falcon, winner 
of the 100 backstroke.

<HEADLINE> Helling Hopes for Encore in '99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Rick Helling went into last season as  
the sixth starter in the Texas Rangers' five-man rotation. He goes 
into this season as the team's ace. 
</P>
<P>
	Helling pitched so well last spring that manager Johnny Oates  
had to give him a shot in the regular season. He ended up winning 
his first six starts and going 20-7, entrenching him as Texas' No. 
1 starter. 
</P>
<P>
	The burning question for the Rangers this season is whether  
Helling -- who had never won more than five games in a season and 
had just 11 career wins before last year -- can repeat his 1998 
success. The answer could determine whether the team will 
successfully defend its AL West title. 
</P>
<P>
	Helling's first test comes Monday as Texas' opening day starter  
against Detroit. Brian Moehler (14-13), who also had a breakout 
year in 1998, starts for the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was in Florida, I remember Al Leiter telling me that  
every year is a proving year,'' Helling said. ``If you're coming 
off a good year, you have to prove that you can do it again. If 
you're coming off a bad year, you have to prove it was a fluke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helling and the Rangers may learn their fates very soon. After  
opening with three games against the Tigers, Texas is host to 
Anaheim, its top division rival, for four games. A week later, the 
Rangers start a 15-game stretch that includes 11 games against the 
New York Yankees, Cleveland and Boston -- the other three AL playoff 
teams last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Helling's first six starts are likely to include Detroit,  
Anaheim, Cleveland and either Oakland or Seattle -- plus the Yankees 
twice. 
</P>
<P>
	A bigger issue for Texas is the health of Rafael Palmeiro, John  
Wetteland and Mark McLemore. Although all three are expected to be 
available Monday, Palmeiro and Wetteland missed most of the spring 
recovering from injuries, and McLemore tweaked his oft-injured legs 
over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmeiro, who had operations on his right knee in February and  
March, got in a lot of work the last week of camp and looked sharp 
in recent days. He's likely to spend the first few games at 
designated hitter, keeping his $45 million bat in the lineup and 
preserving his status as the most durable player this decade after 
Cal Ripken Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Wetteland's surgically repaired right arm was doing fine when he  
severely strained his right ankle. He took off more time than he 
wanted to, but it seems to have worked as he's been dominant in his 
last few appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	McLemore had been saying he feels his best since 1996, the last  
season he didn't go on the disabled list. But that was until 
slightly straining his left hamstring Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Most people were surprised to see Helling among the league  
leaders in wins last season. Helling wasn't. He always believed he 
could succeed if given the chance. 
</P>
<P>
	Helling broke in with the Rangers in 1994 and started nine  
games. He split time in the majors and minors the next year, then 
was traded to Florida in 1996. The Marlins used him mainly in 
relief, then traded him back to Texas in 1997. The Rangers weren't 
set on using him as a starter until he proved he deserved the job 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Helling's strength is a good understanding of how to pitch. He  
has good movement on his fastball and likes to throw it high in the 
strike zone. He relies more on fly balls than strikeouts (164 in 
216 1-3 innings last year) and he's averaged about one walk every 
three innings over his career. 
</P>
<P>
	By going 5-0 in his last seven starts last year, Helling proved  
he could rise to the occasion. His 4.41 ERA -- the fifth-highest 
ever for a 20-game winner -- showed he knew how to take advantage of 
the whopping 6.61 runs per game Texas scored for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that I've done the best that I can -- that's what  
motivates me,'' Helling said. ``In no way did last year make me 
lazy. I've worked just as hard as if I'd been 7-20.''

<HEADLINE> Mexico Welcomes Castilla </HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
	MONTERREY, Mexico (AP) -- He was more than 1,000 miles away from  
his hometown and his Colorado Rockies were billed as the visitor. 
But the thousands of fans made it clear Sunday: Vinny Castilla was 
at home. 
</P>
<P>
	They screamed with each two-fingered wave he directed into the  
stands. They gave him a standing ovation when his name was 
announced in the lineup. The song ``Matador'' played over the 
loudspeakers before every at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
	And they crushed into the railing, desperately thrusting  
baseballs in his direction and yelling ``Vinny! Sign mine!'' when 
he signed a few autographs before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were all over there pushing and shoving,'' Castilla said  
after retreating to the dugout. ``Something bad's going to 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Castilla came through on the fans expectations going 4-for-5 and  
scoring one run in the Rockies 8-2 victory against the San Diego 
Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing missing is a home run,'' said Luis Farias, a  
30-year-old fan. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans in the northern Mexican city of Monterrey, only two  
hours from the Texas border, adore Castilla, who hails from the 
southern state of Oaxaca, but had never played in Monterrey Stadium 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	Oaxaca is the poorest state in Mexico, where the minimum wage is  
$3 a day -- far less than Castilla's $24 million, four-year 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the San Diego Padres were considered the home team,  
almost all of the caps, jerseys and banners in the stands read 
Colorado Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
	Five brothers colored their hair purple and wore white shirts  
with purple lettering that spelled out ``Vinny's'' on the front and 
``Rules'' on the back. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like when (Fernando) Valenzuela played with the Dodgers,  
we all rooted for the Dodgers,'' said Ruben Rodriguez, a 
37-year-old computer programmer. ``Now with Vinny we're with the 
Rockies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez, who said he was a soccer fan, was taking his  
9-year-old son Ruben Eduardo to his first baseball game. 
</P>
<P>
	Castilla himself didn't say much before the game but couldn't  
wipe a broad grin off his face as he warmed up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel at home,'' he said in the dugout, slipping a wad of  
Skoal into his cheek. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference, Castilla said he hoped to be a pioneer for  
baseball in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope what I'm doing helps a lot of people, like what  
Fernando Valenzuela did helped me,'' he said. ``People are 
expecting a home run from Vinny Castilla, and I'll do my best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once Castilla emerged for batting practice, Rockies' public  
relations director Jay Alves ran interference, pushing away the 
cameramen and reporters who strayed too close. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Castilla, despite his phenomenal batting statistics,  
isn't as big of a star in Colorado as some other players. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's huge here. There, it's not even close,'' he said. ``He  
might be the most underrated player in baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teammate Dante Bichette, no stranger to fame himself, said  
Castilla seemed to be holding up well. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not too much the nervous type,'' he said. ``It's a lot of  
fun. I couldn't wait to get here and see the reception he's 
getting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Jim Leyland said he welcomed the attention Castilla was  
getting but hoped it wouldn't detract from the game itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want Vinny to have his day and all, but we also have to  
realize this is a real game,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Reporter Death Confessions Recanted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Two Huichol Indians who earlier admitted to  
killing American journalist Philip True have changed their story, 
saying Mexican police tortured confessions from them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't touch him. I didn't kill him,'' Juan Chivarra de la

	De la Cruz, 28, and his brother-in-law, Miguel Hernandez de la  
Cruz, 24, remain jailed in the Mexican state of Jalisco, charged 
with murdering the former Express-News Mexico City correspondent. 
</P>
<P>
	True disappeared in December while on a 100-mile hike to  
document the Huichols. His body was found in a shallow grave. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say the men confessed to strangling True with his own  
neckerchief because he angered them by hiking through Indian land. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, the men told reporters and a criminal court judge they  
killed True because he had threatened their families. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the two say Mexican police forced them to fabricate  
confessions. 
</P>
<P>
	``They hit us a lot, so I decided to say, 'Yes, yes, we did  
it,''' Chivarra said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez told the Express-News that police hung him from a tree  
to gain his confession. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you are hanging from a tree, you will agree to anything,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Jalisco human rights commission had earlier alleged the men  
were tortured into confessing. 
</P>
<P>
	Separate autopsies have also offered conflicting accounts of  
True's death. One by the Jalisco state coroner said True was 
strangled, while a federal autopsy said True died from fluid in his 
lungs and a blow to the head.

<HEADLINE> Singer Deborah Cox Talks to Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Deborah Cox says she's enjoying life on the top of  
the U.S. charts as Canada's first R&AMP;B star -- but don't call her a 
diva. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not,'' she told The Boston Globe in Sunday's editions.  
``I'm really a settled, down-to earth person. I treat people the 
way I like to be treated and that's just with respect. I've always 
been very down-to-earth and not fazed by the music business, or by 
what other people do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cox, of Toronto, made history this year with the longest-running  
No. 1 R&AMP;B hit of all time -- 14 weeks topping the charts with 
``Nobody's Supposed to Be Here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She'll be heading out on tour with R. Kelly this spring and Cox  
says she's hoping to exceed her accomplishments on her current and 
second album ``One Wish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all about longevity,'' said Cox, 25. ``I want to be an  
artist, who 10 years from now, won't be a has-been. And past of 
that longevity is singing really great songs... Every album we put 
together, it's about the song.''

<HEADLINE> INS Raids Worry Asparagus Farmers / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KENNEWICK, Wash. (AP) -- With harvest close at hand, asparagus  
growers are worried that a threatened federal search for illegal 
workers will leave them shorthanded. 
</P>
<P>
	They fear the Immigration and Naturalization Service will raid  
farms as part of a crackdown that included Yakima fruit warehouses 
in February. That could leave asparagus growers strapped for labor 
for a second straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't like having this threat hanging over our heads,''  
said Mike Gempler, director of the Washington Growers League. 
``There is the possibility of losing a sizable portion of acres 
during critical work on a perishable crop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the Yakima raids, which resulted in the firings of about  
600 employees, INS officials promised more enforcement throughout 
eastern Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal agency is on a nationwide push to reduce the number  
of illegal aliens by focusing on industries that traditionally have 
had high numbers of undocumented workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been told (INS agents) are coming down this way,'' said  
Bryan Alford, a grower in Franklin County. 
</P>
<P>
	Farm workers are grating under the pressure, too. The Yakima  
firings were condemned by numerous worker advocate groups and the 
local Roman Catholic bishop. 
</P>
<P>
	For asparagus, timing is everything. Spears that aren't cut when  
ready often grow beyond marketable size by the next day, said Mike 
Harker of the Washington Asparagus Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Roughly 6,500 workers cut the state's asparagus crop, harvesting  
22,000 acres in about six weeks of backbreaking work. 
</P>
<P>
	Harker said there are ``significant numbers of illegal workers  
in the labor force'' -- a condition farmers say they don't want but 
can't do much about. 
</P>
<P>
	Kent McMullen, a cherry and Asian pear farmer near Ringold, said  
job seekers can show him any of 28 different pieces of 
identification. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have seen ID that I suspected was maybe counterfeit, but I  
am not an expert, and I am not the police force, nor should any 
farmer be,'' McMullen said. 
</P>
<P>
	An INS strike during peak harvest could force a farm out of  
business, said McMullen, who wants legal workers to be issued an 
electronic card that can be scanned by computer and verified like a 
personal check. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington and California each produce about 40 percent of the  
nation's asparagus. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington's 1998 crop was worth $40 million, Harker said.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- While searching for the pesky pink  
hibiscus mealybug, University of Florida researchers instead found 
the papaya mealybug, which eats the sap of hibiscus, papaya, 
cassava and other plants. 
</P>
<P>
	As the insects feed on sap, they attack plants by injecting a  
toxic substance into leaves, stunting the plants' growth and 
causing them to become gnarled. 
</P>
<P>
	``This discovery of a pest we didn't even suspect was here shows  
how easily alien insect species can cross our leaky borders and 
wreak havoc on our yards, farms and plant nurseries,'' said 
Marjorie Hoy, a scholar in biological control at the university's 
Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-six samples of the insect have been found in the state.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're concerned because this pest has been found on both  
coasts and could have spread to other locations,'' said Avas Hamon, 
an entomologist in the Division of Plant Industry of the Florida 
Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida discoveries are the only ones in the continental  
United States, said Dale Meyerdirk, who heads the U.S. Department 
of Agriculture's mealybug control program in Riverdale, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA officials are searching in Mexico and Central America for  
natural enemies of the papaya mealybug. Those enemies are to be 
tested on the department's papaya mealybug colony in the U.S. 
Virgin Islands.

<HEADLINE> Commitisize Wins El Rincon Handicap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Commitisize led the entire way to win  
Sunday's $150,000 El Rincon Handicap by 1 1/4 lengths over Majorien. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was the 15th stakes triumph at the Santa Anita  
winter-spring meeting for trainer Bob Baffert, breaking the record 
of 14 he shared with Neil Drysdale (1997-98) and Charlie 
Whittingham (1970-71). 
</P>
<P>
	It came a day after the Baffert-trained pair of General  
Challenge and Prime Timber finished 1-2 in the $750,000 Santa Anita 
Derby. The Santa Anita meeting finishes April 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by David Flores and carrying 117 pounds, Commitisize  
covered 1 1/8 miles on turf in 1:48 1-5 and paid $8.20, $4.80 and 
2.80. 
</P>
<P>
	The win was the sixth in 16 lifetime starts for Commitisize and  
was worth $90,000, raising the career earnings of the 4-year-old 
son of Explodent to $538,242. 
</P>
<P>
	``This horse is a pro and he knows what he's doing,'' Flores  
said. ``When I picked up the reins the last part of the race, he 
really picked it up and finished so well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Majorien, the 2-1 second-favorite ridden by Kent Desormeaux and  
carrying 117 pounds, crossed the finish line 1 1/4 lengths ahead of 
Ladies Din and returned $3.40 and $2.60. 
</P>
<P>
	Ladies Din paid $2.20 to show.

<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The John F. Kennedy Memorial was defaced by  
vandals with spray paint who caused thousands of dollars worth of 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The black and red graffiti on the interior walls of the downtown  
memorial might have been done by a hate group, said Officer Leroy 
Quigg of the Dallas police gang unit. The painted images included a 
swastika. 
</P>
<P>
	Police believe the vandalism occurred late Friday night or  
Saturday morning. Cleanup should be completed in a few days, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The monument attracts about 500,000 visitors annually. It was  
also vandalized in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The memorial, built in 1970, consists of 50-foot-high white  
concrete walls that surround a square black marble slab bearing the 
name of the president who was assassinated nearby in 1963.

<HEADLINE> Workers Denied Vacation for YK2 Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Save the champagne for another occasion. This  
New Year's Eve is going to be dry for thousands of workers pulling 
Y2K duty. 
</P>
<P>
	Fears that the Year 2000 computer bug will create havoc has  
caused companies nationwide to limit -- even forbid -- vacation time 
at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the bans are just a couple days or so. Others will last  
months. Technicians, utility workers, bankers, city employees, 
emergency personnel and financial consultants are among those 
who'll be shelving their party hats and noisemakers come Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The blackout periods have some workers grousing, but others are  
taking the situation in stride. 
</P>
<P>
	Willie Kennedy had hoped to toast the new year in the Caribbean  
warmth of Aruba. He and his wife, Shawn, had planned the island 
trip for years. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Kennedy, a computer technician for the Cleveland-based  
bank KeyCorp, will watch the calendar turn at his desk while his 
wife celebrates at home with their two pre-teen sons. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought it'd be nice to sit on a warm beach while Cleveland  
is freezing. Now it's out of the question,'' says Kennedy, who is 
in charge of making sure the computer system doesn't crash in any 
of KeyCorp's 960 branches. The bank has told about a fourth of its 
workers they will have New Year's Eve duty. 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K concern involves computers designed to recognize only  
the last two digits of a year, so that 2000 could be misread as 
1900. Some predict widespread problems such as power outages, 
communication and transportation disruptions, lost documents and 
crippled automatic tellers. 
</P>
<P>
	``During that time frame, my heart is going to be racing so fast  
with excitement. This is the biggest New Year's Eve of a lifetime 
and the biggest for my career,'' Kennedy says. 
</P>
<P>
	Although KeyCorp and thousands of other companies believe  
they're Y2K compliant, they don't want to take any chances. Among 
employers imposing vacation bans are: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Merrill Lynch, with 64,000 employees worldwide, has asked  
managers and other key personnel not to take time off from Dec. 1 
through Feb. 15, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Detroit Edison Co. has banned vacations for its 8,400 utility  
workers from Dec. 27 to Jan. 7, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Southern Company, a leading national private provider of  
electricity, based in Atlanta, is figuring out how many workers to 
pull in over the holiday weekend. ``It's not across-the-board, but 
management is determining the need for people to be accessible on a 
department-by-department basis,'' said spokesman Mike Tyndall. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The DuPage County Sheriff's office, just west of Chicago, has  
blocked off all of November, December and January for its 530 
employees, ranging from deputies to secretaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to be Chicken Little, but I don't know if the sky  
will be falling,'' says Sheriff John Zaruba, who plans to treat his 
workers to pizza on New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half the 200-plus chief information officers and  
technology executives polled by CIO magazine earlier this year said 
they would ban vacations for information technology staffers in the 
week around New Year's. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve, anticipating a surging demand for cash  
toward year's end, plans to stockpile an extra $200 billion, 
one-third more than normal, and the Fed branch in Cleveland is 
asking its 1,200 employees to be available from Dec. 27 to Jan. 10, 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``People don't have to be there for 24 hours during those two  
weeks. We just don't know what might happen and want everyone on 
call,'' said spokeswoman June Gates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabre Group, a travel and transportation technology company  
based in Fort Worth, Texas, will have officials in a command center 
tracking the new year's arrival around the world. Spokeswoman 
Jennifer Hudson said heavy staffing is also planned for the 
company's Tulsa, Okla., data center. 
</P>
<P>
	For having to work during ``what really amounts to an important  
world event,'' she said, rewards will likely include a later party 
for workers and their families -- ``a kind of roll-back-the-clock 
party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heather Grzelecki, 21, reacted with far less equanimity when she  
found out about a two-week vacation ban for all city employees in 
Macedonia, about 20 miles southeast of Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Grzelecki, a city tax preparer, usually spends the week  
after Christmas with friends and family. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's aggravating. If something goes wrong, there's nothing we  
can do but look at each other,'' she said. ``Why should I sit here 
doing nothing when I could be with my family?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Grzelecki said she thinks the Y2K scare is being blown out  
of proportion. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're acting like some crazy monster is going to come in and  
gobble everything up. It's not going to happen. Everyone is into 
this way too deep.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheila Walton, 49, of Cleveland is looking on the bright side.  
The Red Cross worker will be joining dozens of emergency personnel 
standing by in case electric power is interrupted or phone lines go 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least I'll have something to do this New Year's Eve,'' said  
Mrs. Walton, a social worker who usually spends that night at home 
watching television while her husband sleeps. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's nothing going on, then it'll be a party for the  
emergency workers,'' she said. ``Of course, they're going to have 
to be sober.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Review of 'Tongue of a Bird' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For all its talk about flight, ``Tongue of a  
Bird,'' Ellen McLaughlin's murky memory play, curiously refuses to 
fly. 
</P>
<P>
	This earthbound meditation, which opened Sunday at  
off-Broadway's Public Theater, is the story of a female 
search-and-rescue pilot looking for a little girl abducted in the 
Adirondacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The particular lost thing -- I've always found it,'' says  
Maxine, the pilot scouring the snowy wilderness for the missing 
child. What Maxine can't quite locate is her own life, specifically 
memories of her mother. The older woman committed suicide and now 
comes back -- dressed in a leather flying coat, goggles and helmet -- 
to haunt her daughter. She hovers about five feet above Maxine's 
bed, swooping and somersaulting her way into her daughter's psyche. 
</P>
<P>
	Mom isn't the only person Maxine encounters in her journey to  
self-awareness. She must contend with the missing girl's 
contentious mother; her own grandmother, a Polish immigrant whose 
health is failing, and the missing youngster herself, bloodied but 
very much a presence in this play. 
</P>
<P>
	The characters carry on odd, lyrical conversations that slowly  
push the plot forward, without shedding much light on themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	What occasionally lifts ``Tongue of a Bird'' out of the obtuse  
is its cast, starting with a radiant Cherry Jones as the indecisive 
pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, a Tony winner for her performance in ``The Heiress,'' is  
an actress of enormous conviction. She grounds Maxine in a reality 
that the play never quite achieves. Jones' manner is charming, 
simple and straightforward. 
</P>
<P>
	Maxine's conversations with her dotty grandmother are funny and  
fresh, particularly because Elizabeth Wilson gives the older woman 
a gentle, almost whimsical quality. 
</P>
<P>
	Melissa Leo emphasizes the harshness of the distraught mother of  
the missing girl. As the object of Maxine's search, young Julia 
McIlvaine is fine, brash and a bit boisterous. Sharon Lawrence is 
left with the evening's least rewarding -- and most difficult -- 
role, the ethereal mother. In her aviator outfit, the airborne 
Lawrence looks like a cross between Amelia Earhart and Peter Pan. 
</P>
<P>
	Director Lisa Peterson can't quite get a handle on the play's  
fanciful swoops and swirls. Neither can the production staff, which 
had problems with lighting and sound cues at a recent preview 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	But then ``Tongue of a Bird'' never soars, finding itself lost  
in cloudy pretensions that don't allow this wordy play to really 
take off.

<HEADLINE> Rays Open 2nd Season in Baltimore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- By theory, opening day is merely one game in  
162, the first step in a marathon that stretches through the entire 
summer and finally concludes in early October. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Baltimore Orioles, however, the season opener can often  
be a harbinger of things to come. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past five years, Baltimore has gone 3-2 on opening day.  
Each time they won -- in 1994, '96 and '97 -- the Orioles finished 
over .500. They were 63-49 before the 1994 strike and reached the 
playoffs in both 1996 and '97. 
</P>
<P>
	When they lost their season opener, the Orioles ended up with a  
losing record. That includes last year, when a 4-1 loss to Kansas 
City proved to be the starting point of a disappointing season that 
ended with a 79-83 record -- and that with the highest payroll in 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles, naturally, hope to get off with a win Monday when  
they send Mike Mussina to the mound in the opener against the Tampa 
Bay Devil Rays. But no one on the team is expecting a horrid season 
if Baltimore fails to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just one game. That's the way you have to look at it,''  
Mussina said Sunday on the eve of his fifth opening-day start. 
``It's great to win the first game, great to get off on a good 
note. But if you don't, it's by no means the end of the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Will Clark, who is preparing for his first opening day with the  
Orioles, was told of the connection between opening day success and 
regular-season prosperity. He quickly waved his hand, dismissing it 
as mere coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know what that is to me? A meaningless statistic,'' he  
said. ``Sure you want to win on opening day. There's a lot more 
adrenaline and emotion than in spring training, but it's just 
another game in the standings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles' opening day lineup includes four players who  
weren't with the team last year: Clark, Albert Belle, Charles 
Johnson and Jeff Conine, who will serve as the designated hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devil Rays also have a new look as they enter their second  
season. The most notable addition is Jose Canseco, who brings his 
hit-or-miss bat south from Toronto to help an offense that finished 
last in the majors in homers and runs scored in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite finishing in the top five in the AL in ERA and fielding  
percentage, Tampa Bay went 63-99 in its first season and finished 
one notch behind Baltimore in the AL East cellar. But the Devil 
Rays won seven of 12 from the Orioles, including a four-game road 
sweep in May that left Baltimore with a 20-23 record and in a 
comeback mode for the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``They came in here and surprised us,'' Baltimore reliever Jesse  
Orosco said. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest disappointment for the Devil Rays last year was the  
play of veterans Fred McGriff, Paul Sorrento, Wilson Alvarez and 
Roberto Hernandez. All came to camp this year determined to be more 
productive. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could walk in here the first day and tell there was a  
difference,'' manager Larry Rothschild said. ``I won't say they 
were embarrassed, but I think a lot of guys were not pleased with 
how they did last year and they've come in and worked very hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rothschild has chosen Alvarez to start Monday ahead of Rolando  
Arrojo, who has been slowed by stiff back. Alvarez pitched a 
no-hitter against the Orioles in 1991 but stumbled to a 6-14 record 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're giving me another chance. I know they wanted Arrojo to  
pitch and he deserves it,'' Alvarez said. ``The way he pitched last 
year, he deserves to be No. 1 here. It's too bad he's hurt.''

<HEADLINE> Can Antibiotic Stop Heart Attacks? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Could taking an antibiotic spare heart  
patients from future heart attacks, bypass surgery or even death? 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers hope to find out with a federally funded study based  
on growing evidence a common bacterial infection may trigger heart 
attacks and worsen, perhaps even cause, atherosclerosis -- narrowing 
of the arteries from plaque deposits. 
</P>
<P>
	Given that known risk factors for heart disease such as smoking,  
high cholesterol and high blood pressure can't account for many 
cases, doctors increasingly suspect infectious agents may be partly 
to blame for some of the 1.75 million heart attacks, bypass 
surgeries and artery-clearing angioplasties in this country each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The prime suspect: a bacteria called Chlamydia pneumoniae, a  
cousin to the sexually transmitted form of Chlamydia that instead 
causes pneumonia and bronchitis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe 60 percent of the population have gotten it in the  
past,'' often without becoming ill, said Dr. John Kostis, chairman 
of medicine at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New 
Brunswick, one of 26 sites used in the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Jeffrey Anderson, chief of cardiology at the University of  
Utah Medical Center in Salt Lake City, said that just as doctors 
have learned many peptic ulcers are caused by a bacterial infection 
and can be treated with antibiotics, the same could be true with 
some heart disease cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``Antibiotic therapy could become a major breakthrough treatment  
against a disease that kills more Americans each year than any 
other disease,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Half of the 4,000 heart disease patients to be studied will be  
given a weekly antibiotic pill, Zithromax, for one year, while the 
comparison group gets a dummy pill. Neither will know who is taking 
which pill. 
</P>
<P>
	The two groups will be compared over four years to see which has  
more heart ``events'' -- deaths, heart attacks, increasing 
atherosclerosis requiring surgery, and major chest pain, which 
indicates the heart isn't getting enough oxygenated blood. 
</P>
<P>
	Blood from some patients will be tested to see if the antibiotic  
is killing the bacteria, lead researcher Dr. J. Thomas Grayston, 
professor of epidemiology at the University of Washington in 
Seattle, said last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Zithromax was chosen because it is long-acting and, unlike most  
antibiotics, can get inside cells, where the tough-to-kill 
Chlamydia can hide, dormant, for years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent surge of research generally shows the majority of  
patients studied who had heart attacks or other complications had 
been infected by Chlamydia pneumoniae. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know if it's a cause or an innocent bystander,'' said  
Sonia Skarlatos of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, a 
part of the National Institutes of Health providing $11 million for 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
	Early, small studies have shown that giving Zithromax, known  
generically as azithromycin, to patients after a heart attack 
reduces chances of a second one. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer, the drug's maker, is conducting a similar trial, giving  
the antibiotic for three months to half of the 3,600 heart attack 
victims in the study, according to Michael Dunne, director of its 
central research division in Groton, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Grayston said comparing results of the three-month and yearlong  
treatments, and other differences between the two studies, could 
help in determining which patients might benefit most from 
preventive antibiotic treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to be like immunization for polio, make (heart  
disease) go away,'' Kostis said, but it may well help many heart 
patients. 
</P>
<P>

study should call the coordinating center at 206-577-0259.

<HEADLINE> Mariners Play Last Kingdome Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Chicago White Sox had the worst pitchers in  
the American League last season and the Seattle Mariners' staff 
wasn't much better. 
</P>
<P>
	No surprise, both teams open a new season Monday night with a  
lot of the same old questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time we get the opportunity to get an out, we have to  
get it, because we don't have the offense or pitching to get us out 
of it,'' second-year White Sox manager Jerry Manuel said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the final Mariners' opener in the Kingdome, Mariners manager  
Lou Piniella will use left-hander Jeff Fassero against James 
Baldwin. 
</P>
<P>
	Fassero, 36, is coming off surgery this winter to remove bone  
chips from his pitching elbow. He had a 13.19 ERA this spring, 
giving up 21 earned runs in six innings in his last two exhibition 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Baldwin was 13-6 in 24 starts for the White Sox last season.  
</P>
<P>
	``When you go with experienced pitchers, you have a pretty good  
idea of what to expect,'' Piniella said. ``When you go with a lot 
of young pitchers, you're operating in unchartered waters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners still have a powerful offense, with All-Stars Ken  
Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez, but their pitching is suspect, too. 
</P>
<P>
	With Randy Johnson now pitching for the Arizona Diamondbacks,  
Seattle is hoping young pitchers like Freddy Garcia can come 
through. Garcia, 22, came to the Mariners from Houston in a trade 
for Johnson last July 31. 
</P>
<P>
	In spring training, Garcia, a right-hander, established himself  
as the Mariners' No. 3 starter. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, the Mariners were favored to win the AL West, but  
were a disappointing nine games under .500 to wind up third behind 
Texas and Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle's pitching staff tied for 10th in the league with  
Detroit with a 4.93 ERA last season. The White Sox had a team ERA 
of 5.22, worst in the AL. 
</P>
<P>
	After Baldwin, Chicago's starters will be Mike Sirotka, Jim  
Parque and John Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
	Gone from the White Sox are Albert Belle and Robin Ventura,  
leaving Frank Thomas left to supply most of the offense in a lineup 
that includes newcomer Paul Konerko. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not even an issue at all,'' Thomas said of Chicago's  
losses of Belle and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle and Ventura combined for 69 homers and 243 RBIs last  
season. The White Sox let Belle and Ventura go as free agents -- 
Belle to Baltimore and Ventura to the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariners fans lost a longtime target Saturday night when the  
team traded reliever Bobby Ayala to Montreal for 6-foot-10 
minor-league pitching prospect Jimmy Turman. 
</P>
<P>
	Ayala was 1-10 with a 7.29 ERA in 62 relief appearances with  
Seattle last season. 
</P>
<P>
	In their 23rd season, the Mariners will move into their new  
home, $498 million Safeco Field, on July 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Hank Aaron, who holds the major league record with 755 career  
home runs, will throw out the ceremonial first pitch Monday night. 
Then he'll watch Griffey, a player who could break his record, play 
center field for the Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
	In 10 seasons, Griffey has 350 homers, including 56 last season  
when he led the league for the second time.

<HEADLINE> GOP Attacks Gore on Internet Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With Vice President Al Gore heading to Silicon  
Valley this week to raise campaign funds, a Republican group 
intends to ridicule him in a television commercial for claiming to 
have taken the initiative in creating the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reality check. The Internet was created in 1969 by the  
Pentagon,'' says the advertisement, which was financed by the 
Republican Leadership Council. 
</P>
<P>
	It also taunts the vice president for saying he had lived on a  
farm and his father taught him how to do chores in the hot sun. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not quite. Gore grew up in a top floor suite of a luxury hotel  
in Washington, D.C.,'' the ad continues, although it omits the fact 
that Gore's family also owned a farm in Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	The commercial also notes Gore's claim for having worked on  
reinventing government, a major project during the Clinton 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah right,'' the ad states. ``Earth to Gore. Stop trying to  
reinvent reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's campaign manager, Craig Smith, shot back: ``No half-baked  
attack ad by the Republicans will hide the fact that they are 
offering no vision for America's future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said Gore's leadership in Internet technology is genuine  
and he saved taxpayers ``millions'' with his campaign to make 
government more efficient. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Miller, a spokesman for the group that paid for the ad,  
said it will run over 50 times in two days in the area around 
Silicon Valley, including on broadcast stations in San Francisco, 
at a cost of roughly $30,000. Additionally, the group bought a 
smaller amount of time on CNN programs and in the Washington, D.C., 
area. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was about four years ago now that Dick Morris and Bill  
Clinton sat down in the White House and designed some issue ads 
talking about Bob Dole,'' Miller said of the commercials that 
helped Clinton on his way to re-election. ``I'd rather learn from 
history than repeat it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	At 2,826 eye-glazing pages, the quarterly ``Statement of  
Disbursements of the House'' details how the House of 
Representatives spent its money in the last three months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	It lists everything from staff salaries to the cost of newspaper  
subscriptions for lawmakers' offices, from coffee and bottled water 
for congressional offices, to reimbursements for taxi rides for 
lawmakers and staff. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those pages records federal funds returned to the  
government by House members ``for reduction of public debt.'' In 
all, 14 of 435 House members made the list, and returned 
$13,460.83, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest gift listed was $3,700, from Democratic Rep. Lane  
Evans, D-Ill., while the smallest was from Republican Rep. Richard 
Baker of Louisiana, at $99.61.

	Top leaders of the House and Senate are traveling widely during  
the current two-week congressional recess.

	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., was in Europe last week,  
leading a delegation of lawmakers. The Democratic leader, Rep. 
Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., led a group to India. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate's top Democrat, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, was  
heading on six-day trip to South America, with stops in Brazil, 
Chile and Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
	Also expected to accompany Daschle were the Senate's  
second-ranking Democrat, Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, as well as 
Democrat Byron Dorgan of North Dakota and Sen. Ben Nighthorse 
Campbell, a Colorado Republican. The group planned to discuss trade 
and economic security issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Alone among the top leaders of Congress, Senate Majority Leader  
Trent Lott was not going abroad during the break. An aide said Lott 
was spending most of his time in Mississippi.

<HEADLINE> Report Cites China-Clinton Donation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The head of Chinese military intelligence  
sent a Democratic fund-raiser in Southern California $300,000 in 
campaign donations to help President Clinton's reelection in 1996, 
the Los Angeles Times reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Ji Shengde sent the money to Johnny Chung, but only a  
portion of the money reached Democratic coffers, the newspaper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung's testimony has given investigators their first direct  
link between a senior Chinese government official and illicit 
foreign contributions, the Times said, citing sources familiar with 
Chung's sealed statements to federal prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	It is illegal for U.S. political parties or candidates to accept  
contributions from foreign sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung, a Taiwanese-born businessman who is now a U.S. citizen,  
donated nearly $400,000 to Democratic candidates and causes from 
1994 to 1996, but the money was returned after questions arose 
about its legality. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung admitted making nearly $30,000 in illegal contributions to  
Democrats including $20,000 to the Clinton-Gore reelection 
campaign. In December he was sentenced to five years probation and 
3,000 hours of community service as part of a plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung and Ji were brought together by Liu Chaoying, who was a  
Chung business partner as well as a lieutenant colonel in the 
People's Liberation Army, the Times said. Liu did not respond 
Friday to questions sent by the Times to her office in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	In their first meeting in August 1996, Chung said, he declined  
Ji's money but the general said he was already engaged in similar 
transactions with others serving as conduits for Chinese funds to 
support Clinton's reelection. 
</P>
<P>
	Within a few days, Liu deposited $300,000 into Chung's Hong Kong  
bank account, telling him it was from Ji, sources told the 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal election records show that five weeks after receiving  
the money, Chung donated $35,000 in three checks to the Democratic 
National Committee. The remaining funds went to one of Chung's 
California bank accounts but it is not known how that money was 
used. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic party ``was unaware of any supposed  
relationship'' between Chung and the Chinese government at the time 
of the contributions, said DNC spokesman Rick Hess. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung declined to speak with the newspaper, saying he has  
``already told the whole truth to the grand jury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for China's embassy in Washington denied any  
involvement in the 1996 elections. ``All these allegations about 
so-called Chinese government officials' political contributions 
into U.S. campaigns are sheer fabrications,'' said Yu Shuning.

<HEADLINE> Four Shot To Death in Mich. Eatery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Three barbecue restaurant employees and a child  
were found fatally shot Sunday in the eatery, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers called to the Prestige Restaurant about 7:30 a.m. found  
the victims ``throughout'' the restaurant, said police spokesman 
Officer Octaveious Miles. He had no details about how police were 
called. 
</P>

	Details were still sketchy Sunday afternoon. Police didn't know  
the child's age or possible connection to the other victims, the 
time of the shootings or a definite motive. No arrests had been 
made. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit television station WJBK reported Sunday that the youth  
was 12. 
</P>
<P>
	The restaurant closed around midnight, and Miles said  
investigators think the shootings happened sometime between then

<HEADLINE> Tornado Kills Six in Louisiana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BENTON, La. (AP) -- Searchers spent Sunday morning carefully  
moving debris from piles of wreckage, hoping to find more survivors 
of a tornado that sheared a 3 1/2-mile swath through Bossier Parish 
and killed six people. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you would've dropped a 747 and a B-52 on these areas, and  
they had exploded, it wouldn't have done this much damage,'' 
Bossier Parish Sheriff Larry Deen said. ``This is just a twisted 
mass of debris where people used to live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teams with dogs had searched through the night, looking for  
spots where survivors might be hidden. Their work was slowed 
because many power lines were down, and there were several gas 
leaks in the areas flattened by the twister. 
</P>
<P>
	And in some places, officers had to carry their dogs through the  
jagged wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	By afternoon, no more bodies had been found.  
</P>
<P>
	The tornado, believed to be about a half-mile wide, curved  
through farm and rural land on Saturday, and hit two mobile home 
parks in this northwest Louisiana community as well as the upscale 
subdivision of Palmetto Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard it coming. It was roaring,'' said Benny Ferguson, 43,  
who lived in the Hay Meadow Trailer Park, where three people died. 
``I went outside and looked and then I could see it. I went back in 
the house to find a place to hide, but there's nowhere to hide in a 
trailer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His roof was stripped off and a shed was gone, but he was in  
better shape than many of his neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson said neighbors Darlene and Crystal Gregrich were  
baby-sitting three children when the tornado picked up their 
trailer and dropped it across the road. None was seriously hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	One trailer, still mostly standing, was topped at one end by the  
black rectangular frame of a second mobile home and at the other by 
a tree. 
</P>
<P>
	Six people were known dead, and hospitals had treated and  
released 100, the sheriff said. He didn't know how many were 
hospitalized; Bossier Parish hospitals overflowed, and some people 
were taken to Shreveport, 16 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	At least nine people were hospitalized in critical or guarded  
condition, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Six people dead is terrible. But when you look at it, it's  
hard to believe there were that few,'' said Ed Baswell, spokesman 
for the sheriff's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Oak trees were toppled and pines were snapped. Cars and trucks  
lay crushed, roofing tin was wrapped around giant pecan trees and 
fences were festooned with tufts of insulation. A horse lay dead in 
one field. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, I have half a house. The west side walls and roof  
are gone,'' said Don Vallery, 50. ``My neighbor's camper is on top 
of my truck and his stove is in my living room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vallery and his wife and two daughters were away when the  
twister struck. 
</P>
<P>
	A separate tornado destroyed a church in Logansport, a DeSoto  
Parish town southwest of Shreveport near the Texas border. And a 
tornado or severe wind downed trees, damaged some homes and caused 
minor injuries in a Shreveport neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	The same mass of storms caused flooding in southern Missouri.  
Fifty people were moved to emergency shelters after flash floods 
struck Fredericktown, and some had to be rescued from their roofs. 
A 12-year-old boy was found dead. 
</P>
<P>
	About 6 p.m. Sunday in Louisiana, another tornado uprooted trees  
in a rural part of Taylortown, about 20 miles southeast of Benton, 
said Chuck Mazziotti, director of the Bossier Parish Office of 
Emergency Preparedness. There were no reports of injuries or 
damaged property, Mazziotti said

<HEADLINE> Paintball Has Risk of Eye Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A full-face paintball shield, with its  
big-eyed goggles, can make a player look like Darth Vader. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors think that's a cool look, especially when the  
alternative is not to be able to look at all. Potentially blinding 
eye injuries can happen to a player who succumbs to the impulse to 
remove the shield. 
</P>
<P>
	In his study of paintball injury cases, seven of 11 people who  
had taken off the eye protection wound up legally blind in one eye, 
said Lt. Col. Allen B. Thach, an ophthalmologist at Walter Reed 
Army Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The combat simulation game is supposed to be played while  
wearing face protection that includes clear, impact-resistant 
plastic over the eyes. Doctors and paintball experts agree that 
most players -- as well as virtually all paintball game centers -- 
insist on eye protection. 
</P>
<P>
	But it may be tempting to remove the shield after a paintball  
lands on a lens or if the goggles fog up, Thach said. 
</P>
<P>
	``During the heat of the battle, as you may say, you may not be  
thinking straight, and take off the goggles without thinking,'' 
Thach said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doing so exposes the eye to the impact of a missile of  
gelatine-enclosed paint fired from a carbon dioxide-powered gun at 
300-400 feet per second, according to Thach's article in the 
medical journal Ophthalmology. 
</P>
<P>
	It is not the only cause of injury; two other people in the  
study were hit by ricochets in which the projectile traveled up 
under the face mask. But the experts consider this unusual and say 
the risk can be reduced with the newer masks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't find the paint itself causing the problem,'' said Dr.  
Nick Mamalis, professor of ophthalmology at the University of Utah, 
who also has seen paintball injuries. ``It's the ball the paint is 
in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The patients he has seen often were able to blink in time to  
keep paint out of their eyes, but the gelatine of the ball damaged 
the eye by the force of the impact, Mamalis said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Thach's article, patients suffered such major injuries as  
hemorrhages, retinal detachments and ruptures of the eyeball. 
Mamalis also reported cases of glaucoma, elevated pressure in the 
eye, caused by the impact of the ball or by damage to structures 
that allow drainage of liquid from the eye. 
</P>
<P>
	The risk is probably very low when eye protection is used  
properly, the doctors said. Exactly how low cannot be determined, 
in part because there is no industry association to keep track of 
the number of injuries, or even estimate the total number of 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	The protective equipment itself is sturdy, according to Bob  
Lowry, sales marketing manager for Scott USA, a manufacturer in Sun 
Valley, Idaho. The goggles have thicker polycarbonate plastic than 
is used in motorcycle faceguards, he said. Some paintball 
faceguards have tearaway plastic sheeting on the front, so a player 
can clear the visual field simply by ripping off the 
paint-spattered top sheet, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the industry self-polices. At reputable paintball centers,  
employees order players to wear eye protection, signs notify 
players to do it, and judges take players out of the game if they 
lose their protection, Thach said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bigger risk area may be in unsupervised play -- ``renegade  
paintball, Joe and his cousin going out in the back yard,'' said 
Bill Mills of Lake Park, Fla., a longtime player who oversees 
Warpig, an Internet site devoted to the game. However, because 
there are no data on unsupervised games, he can't be sure, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And the attitudes of the players, typically teen-age boys and  
young men, may play a part, Mamalis said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Young males tend not to pay attention to things such as ocular  
protection, even if it's required,'' Mamalis said. ``I asked one 
man, `Why did you not wear them,' and he said, `Well, they didn't 
make me,' and he was quite ticked off that I even asked him.''

<HEADLINE> Va. Shipbuilding Union Plans Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (AP) -- Thousands of workers were scheduled to  
begin striking at Newport News Shipbuilding at midnight Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't heard a word'' from shipyard management, said  
Arnold Outlaw, president of Local 8888 of the United Steelworkers 
of America. 
</P>
<P>
	The union, which represents many of the yard's 9,200 hourly  
workers, planned to strike over what it says are insufficient 
raises in a proposed new contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipyard spokesmen Jerri Fuller Dickseski said the company had  
gotten no official notification from the union of a strike vote or 
that there would be a strike. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue are many of the details of the new contract for hourly  
employees at the shipyard, Hampton Roads' largest employer with 
17,400 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The current collective bargaining agreement expires Sunday at  
midnight. In the new contract, the union wants an across-the-board 
hourly pay increase of $3.95 over three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The shipyard offered to raise wages 6 percent immediately, 3  
percent in August 2000 and 4 percent in December 2001 for most 
hourly employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The shipyard said the average worker would get a total increase  
of $2.49 an hour, with automatic promotions based on experience and 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
	About 7,200 hourly workers voted Thursday to reject that plan,  
which the yard said would be its final offer.

<HEADLINE> Costner Plays in Big League Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- ``Field of Dreams'' star Kevin Costner  
realized one of his biggest dreams -- playing in a big league 
baseball game. 
</P>
<P>
	He also realized one of his biggest fears -- making an error  
Sunday to lose the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Costner dropped a ball in the sixth inning, allowing the scoring  
run as the Anaheim Angels defeated his alma mater, Cal State 
Fullerton, 2-1 in the Angels' exhibition finale. 
</P>
<P>
	Costner was hitless in three times at bat. But he made two tough  
plays at shortstop, and even pitched two-thirds of an inning, 
striking out rookie Jeb Daugherty and retiring Angels manager Terry 
Collins on a ground ball in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a really great day, but it would have been better  
without the error,'' Costner, 44, said. ``I felt really bad about 
making us lose the game. I just missed it in front of everybody. I 
really wanted to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Angels pitcher Chuck Finley liked what he saw from  
Costner. 
</P>
<P>
	``He actually handled himself pretty well out there,'' Finley  
said. ``You can tell he's a good athlete. He made a couple plays 
that impressed me, especially on that backhander.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Costner has starred in baseball movies as ``Field of Dreams''  
and ``Bull Durham,'' in which he performed his own baseball stunts. 
He recently played a pitcher in the upcoming ``For The Love of The 
Game.''

<HEADLINE> Lakers Call Rodman a 'Distraction' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dennis Rodman says the Los Angeles Lakers need  
him to succeed. Some of his teammates aren't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't afford another distraction from him,'' guard Derek  
Harper said in this week's edition of Newsweek magazine. ``I'm not 
management, but if it happened again, that would be it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman has been late for practices and squabbled with coach Kurt  
Rambis. He also missed four games on a recent road trip because of 
undisclosed personal reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	He was ejected Saturday night against Golden State, his two  
technical fouls increasing his season's total to 11. The rest of 
the team has 12 technicals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We get called a party team all the time, and that's not what  
all of us do,'' Kobe Bryant told Newsweek. ``Some of us take this 
seriously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman told the magazine he is the only one who can lead Los  
Angeles to the NBA championship. The Lakers (22-12) are second to 
Portland in the Pacific Division. 
</P>
<P>
	``They depend on me to keep this ship afloat,'' he said. ``It's  
amazing to me that a person who doesn't score, doesn't make Michael 
Jordan-type moves, is expected to come in and win a championship 
for a team in total disarray. Am I a genius? Am I a miracle worker? 
Am I God? No -- but I have a gift.''

<HEADLINE> Contrite Irabu Returns to Yankees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hideki Irabu returned to the New York Yankees  
today and apologized for his absence. Then, he took part in a drill 
covering first base -- a one-man drill. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Irabu's failure to cover the bag last week that prompted  
owner George Steinbrenner to call the Japanese pitcher a ``fat ... 
toad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irabu stayed behind at the team's spring camp at Tampa, Fla.,  
while the Yankees traveled Thursday to the West Coast for a pair of 
exhibition games. But with the support of Steinbrenner, Irabu 
rejoined the club before it played the Los Angeles Dodgers on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, general manager Brian Cashman did his best to play  
down angry remarks made by acting manager Don Zimmer toward 
Steinbrenner a day earlier in connection with the Irabu episode. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't as big as it's been made into,'' Cashman said. ``I  
believe that yesterday was yesterday. Today is a new day, today is 
a day we get back to business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Through an interpreter, Irabu read a statement to Zimmer and his  
teammates apologizing for staying in Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	Irabu, who has struggled this spring, said he asked to remain  
behind ``to think about many things.'' He didn't elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Irabu also said he was going to try and regain the trust of his  
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	When Irabu remained in Tampa, it was expected he would not  
rejoin the Yankees for several days, but that changed Saturday 
after several meetings and a one-hour workout at the Yankees' minor 
league facility. 
</P>
<P>
	At that stage, Steinbrenner said he hoped Irabu would pitch  
Wednesday in Oakland. But Zimmer, filling in for manager Joe Torre, 
had said Friday that Ramiro Mendoza would pitch against the A's 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer -- who wondered aloud ``who called him a fat pig, or a fat  
plum?'' -- said Saturday that his mind wouldn't be changed ``by 
anybody.'' He added that he would quit if given an ultimatum that 
Irabu would be Wednesday's starting pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	``George Steinbrenner has been good to me, but, to me, you can't  
sit back here and be a little wimp,'' Zimmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the situation seemed quiet.  
</P>
<P>
	``I talked to the boss (Steinbrenner) this morning, and he said  
he didn't mandate that anyone start,'' Cashman said. ``This isn't 
as big as it's been made. There was certainly a bump in the road 
the last few days, there's no question. We've dealt with bigger 
things. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, like anybody, you don't want things blown up. I  
think it's fair to say you like to keep things in house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if Steinbrenner had expressed displeasure with  
Zimmer's remarks, Cashman replied, ``If he did, I prefer to keep 
that quiet. If he did, I'm not going to convey that to you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer reiterated Sunday that Mendoza will pitch Wednesday, and  
that Irabu will be in the bullpen, at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was sorry the way things happened on Thursday,'' Zimmer  
said of Irabu. ``He felt that he embarrassed the whole club and he 
felt that he would have to win the respect back from the players. 
He seemed like he was very sincere. I would say that it's over 
with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer said he thought it was important that Irabu speak with  
his teammates about the matter, and the apology wasn't solicited by 
anyone with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer said Saturday he tried to phone Steinbrenner three  
different times, but was unable to make contact. He did talk with 
Torre, who asked how the acting manager was holding up -- Zimmer 
told him he was doing fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre underwent prostate cancer surgery last month, and no  
timetable has been set for his return, but Zimmer said he expects 
Torre to come back ``very soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irabu worked on covering first base while pitching coach Mel  
Stottlemyre threw batting practice. It was a drill that Zimmer said 
was supposed to take place Friday, but didn't since Irabu wasn't 
with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer said Stottlemyre had conducted a similar drill previously  
with another pitcher.

<HEADLINE> Mormon Church To Rebuild Temple </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Mormon church President Gordon B. Hinckley  
chose Easter Sunday to announce the church will rebuild its 
historic Nauvoo Temple in Illinois, destroyed by arson and tornado 
after the Mormons moved West. 
</P>
<P>
	In his surprise disclosure at the end of the faith's 169th  
Annual General Conference, Hinckley said the rebuilt temple would 
stand as a memorial to those who built it. It was dedicated in 
1846, after most of the embattled Mormons had left to begin their 
massive exodus to the Salt Lake Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a while before it happens, but the architects have  
begun their work,'' Hinckley said. ``This temple will not be busy 
much of the time. It will be somewhat isolated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said it likely would be very busy during the summer  
months when thousands of members of The Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints visit Nauvoo, Ill. Portions of the city, once 
nearly equal to Chicago in population with some 15,000 residents, 
have been restored by the church. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nauvoo Temple, built on a bluff overlooking the Mississippi  
River on ground selected by church founder Joseph Smith, had an 
exterior of light gray limestone and a tower and spire 165 feet 
high. Smith laid the cornerstone in 1841, three years before he was 
assassinated by a mob in nearby Carthage, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the bare walls were left standing after the building was  
destroyed by an arson fire in October 1848. A tornado later knocked 
down some of the walls and much of the stone was later used in 
other buildings in the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Hinckley said a church member and his family -- he did not name  
them -- had made ``a very substantial contribution to make this 
possible. We are grateful to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did not say whether the restored temple would be built on the  
site of the old, where only foundation stones remain. The church 
already owns the site. 
</P>
<P>
	The church has 56 operating temples and 53 in various stages of  
planning and construction. Temples, where marriages and other 
ordinances considered sacred to Mormons are performed by worthy 
members, are distinct from chapels for weekly worship. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nauvoo Temple was the second built by the church. The first,  
in Kirtland, Ohio, was dedicated in 1836. The Mormons left Ohio and 
settled in Nauvoo in 1839. 
</P>
<P>
	Before his announcement, Hinckley called the 20th century both  
the bloodiest and best in history, an age of enlightenment marred 
by misery and conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been the worst of all centuries with more of war, more  
of man's inhumanity to man, more of conflict and trouble than any 
other century in the history of the world,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The church president also returned to a theme he had sounded  
twice before during the two-day conference: Mormons need to shed 
what some outside the faith perceive as a ``holier-than-thou'' 
attitude. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can be a little more tolerant and friendly to those not of  
our faith, going out of our way to show our respect for them. We 
cannot afford to be arrogant or self-righteous,'' he said.

	U.S. To Send Helicopters to Albania  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States has agreed to send  
low-flying Apache helicopter gunships to Albania, giving NATO the 
ability to directly attack Serb troops and tanks in Yugoslavia but 
also exposing U.S. forces to new dangers. U.S. troops also will 
begin manning a newly deployed Multiple Launch Rocket System in 
Macedonia to fire short- and medium-range missiles into Yugoslavia, 
a senior U.S. official said. Several prominent congressional 
Republicans and Democrats urged President Clinton to make the use 
of ground troops in Kosovo an option. Administration officials 
insisted no American ground forces will be deployed for combat.

<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Air raid sirens sounded in Belgrade  
tonight, signaling the possible onset of a 12th night of NATO 
strikes on Yugoslavia. NATO warplanes and missiles attacked an army 
headquarters, oil refineries and other targets in and around 
Belgrade earlier today. Meanwhile, the Yugoslav military was 
shifting forces in Kosovo to the southwest, where the rebel Kosovo 
Liberation Army was regrouping for what appeared to be a last 
stand, Air Commodore David Wilby said.

	U.S., Europe To Take in Refugees

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amid the growing refugee crisis in the  
Balkans, the United States made it known today that it temporarily 
will provide shelter for up to 20,000 ethnic Albanians fleeing Serb 
assaults. European nations will take in as many as 100,000 -- but 
just until they can return home under international protection. 
``These people have to go back, otherwise there are no people in 
Kosovo,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said. More than 
350,000 ethnic Albanians have fled since NATO airstrikes began on 
March 24, and the exodus is continuing.

to the bloodshed. ``When will there be an end to the diabolical 
spiral of revenge and senseless fratricidal conflict?'' Pope John 
Paul II asked in an emotional departure from his usual words of 
hope at Easter. ``Enough of this cruel shedding of human blood!'' 
he told the tens of thousands gathered in St. Peter's Square.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Knocks Clinton on China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- GOP presidential hopeful Pat Buchanan is  
accusing the Clinton administration of feeding China's trade 
surplus rather than paying attention to ``clear and ominous'' signs 
of Chinese aggression towards Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, in remarks prepared for delivery Monday at San  
Francisco's Commonwealth Club, a nonpartisan public affairs forum, 
described the president's China trade policy as a ``demonstrable 
failure.'' He accused U.S. officials of turning a blind eye to 
human rights violations in China. 
</P>
<P>
	``For Americans there must always be some things still greater  
in the hierarchy of values than the bottom line of a balance 
sheet,'' Buchanan said. ``It's time to put country before commerce 
and let America be America again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China's prime minister, Zhu Rongji, visits Washington this week.  
One topic under discussion is Beijing's application to enter the 
World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the president ought to tell Mr. Zhu Rongji when he gets  
here is, 'Sir, you double-crossed us and we're gonna suspend 
(China's normal trade status) for one year, and we're gonna impose 
on you the same taxes on your goods entering our country as you 
impose on our goods entering yours,''' Buchanan said Sunday on 
``Fox News Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, in the prepared speech, also criticized fellow  
Republicans for ``embracing a series of myths about China'' in 
their failure to renounce Clinton's policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan said the United States easily could drop China as a  
trade partner, because less than 2 percent of its exports went to 
China last year. Beijing, he said, crafts its trade policies to 
augment state power. 
</P>
<P>
	He also charged that China steadily has increased the number of  
missiles it targets against Taiwan, boosted its forces and mock 
test-fired missiles at U.S. forces on Okinawa, Japan and in South 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	``China is now clearly preparing for another crisis to force  
Taiwan back to the `embrace of the Motherland' and intends to use 
the threat of a missile blockade if Taiwan resists,'' Buchanan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He predicted China would put every U.S. warship and base  
``between the Asian coast and Guam'' at risk if American forces 
intervene. Confrontation is avoidable, ``but China is clearly 
preparing for it,'' Buchanan said. 
</P>
<P>
	He urged Congress to impose taxes on imports from China; suspend  
China's ``most favored nation'' status until it improves its human 
rights record; veto loans to China by the World Bank or the Asian 
Development Bank; and contest attempts to admit China into the WTO, 
working instead for Taiwan's admission.

	ROANOKE, Va. (AP) -- Manley Butler's proudest moment as a  
parachute designer came last year when he heard an answering 
machine message from Dick Rutan, who bailed out of his balloon with 
a co-pilot after an equipment failure. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank you for an outstanding parachute,'' said Rutan, who was  
hoping to become the first to fly nonstop around the world in a 
balloon. 
</P>
<P>
	Rutan and Dave Melton parachuted in 45 mph winds from 5,000 feet  
and landed in a cactus-studded pasture in Texas. ``You ought to be 
proud of yourselves,'' Rutan told Butler and his workers. ``You 
saved our butts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Butler is hoping to become known as the inventor of a safer  
parachute for anyone faced with an emergency bailout, not just as a 
custom parachute designer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration has given Butler Parachute  
Systems clearance to manufacture a parachute that uses a ``Sombrero 
Slider.'' Butler said his patent on the contraption will be 
published April 6. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's absolutely brilliant,'' said Dan Poynter, who has written  
seven books on parachutes and skydiving, including voluminous 
technical treatises. ``It's a fairly simple thing, just nobody 
thought it through before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sombrero Slider gets its name because it looks like a  
Mexican hat and it slides down the strings under the canopy as the 
parachute opens. The nylon device slides because there are metal 
eyelets around each parachute string. 
</P>
<P>
	Butler, an aerospace engineer, said the Sombrero Slider controls  
the canopy inflation no matter how fast the person is traveling 
through the air. It opens the canopy faster at slow speeds and 
opens it slower at fast speeds, which reduces the shock that people 
feel when the canopy opens and abruptly slows their descent. 
</P>
<P>
	By forcing the symmetrical opening of the canopy, Butler said,  
the device eliminates dangerous inversions, a malfunction that 
plagues round emergency parachutes but not the rectangle parachutes 
that most sport skydivers use. 
</P>
<P>
	An inversion, which tangles the canopy and strings, can damage  
the canopy, cause bad landings and, in rare cases, keep the canopy 
from opening. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the moment, there are no other companies making this type  
of parachute with an inflation device on it approved by the FAA,'' 
Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Butler's 5-year-old company employs 10 to 20 people, depending  
on how many orders they have to fill. Like the parachutes made for 
Rutan and Melton and those made for Coast Guard rescue operations, 
he designs them to fit specific missions. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody has been seriously hurt using a Butler parachute, but the  
company owner recently had a knee replaced and walks with a limp, 
the legacy of his days as a skydiver. 
</P>
<P>
	Butler, 46, was a crewman on a Navy plane in the early 1970s and  
began skydiving for sport and for testing equipment in 1973. On the 
17th of what would become more than 1,200 jumps, he injured his 
knee. 
</P>
<P>
	He became an engineer for the Navy's parachute development  
center and got a parachute rigger's license. 
</P>
<P>
	His fascination with parachutes, however, goes back to age 6,  
when he was glued to the television set during broadcasts of the 
series ``Rip Cord'' and ``Sky King'' that featured skydiving. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were these guys who were always on some kind of  
adventure,'' he said in his office at the Roanoke manufacturing 
plant. ``I just loved it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, he was on a commercial plane during a trip from  
California to Roanoke when he came up with the ``sombrero 
concept.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force had requested proposals for building a parachute  
that could open at higher speeds without load limits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I let it stew around for awhile,'' Butler said. ``When it came  
to me, I did all the calculations on the back of an envelope.''

<HEADLINE> Red Sox, Royals Ready for Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The Boston Red Sox and Kansas City  
Royals, who had the AL's best winning percentages in spring 
training, open the season in spruced-up Kauffman Stadium tomorrow 
with only one team expected to keep up the pace. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not Kansas City.  
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, we're probably going to be outmatched in the  
majority of the games we play -- talent-wise, name-wise and 
payroll-wise,'' said general manager Herk Robinson, whose 
surprising Royals, amid dire predictions of a fifth straight losing 
season, had a club-record 22-9 spring mark. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I really believe this club has enough character that it's  
going to achieve a lot of things that people don't expect it to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Royals, who lost their top starter and two top run-producers  
from last year's 72-89 team, will open with promising rookies 
Carlos Beltran in center field and Carlos Febles at second base and 
a starting pitcher who expected to be working for some other team 
by now. 
</P>
<P>
	Right-hander Kevin Appier's $5 million contract made him the  
subject of trade talk throughout the spring. But the Royals, unable 
to get a satisfactory offer for a 32-year-old coming off shoulder 
surgery, will have him make his seventh season-opening start. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be honest with you, I didn't think I'd still be with this  
club on opening day,'' said Appier, who ranks among the club's top 
10 in most pitching categories but was 1-2 in three September 
starts last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I'm here and I'm happy to make the most of it. Beyond  
that, I don't even want to think about all the trade stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston, adjusting to the loss of slugging first baseman Mo  
Vaughn, strung together an 18-10 spring record that low-key manager 
Jimy Williams was naturally trying to play down. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just trying to prepare ourselves for opening day,''  
Williams said. ``Our whole key going in was to get ready to compete 
heading into Kansas City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starting for the Red Sox, 92-70 last season, will be  
right-hander Pedro Martinez, whose 19 wins in 1998 were the most by 
a Boston starter since Roger Clemens won 21 in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Replacing Vaughn's .337 average, 40 home runs and 115 RBIs will  
be first baseman Mike Stanley, who hit 29 homers last season. 
</P>
<P>
	But shortstop Nomar Garciaparra insists the Red Sox are past  
even thinking about the loss of Vaughn, who was also a vocal 
clubhouse leader. 
</P>
<P>
	``We go out there and we just play our game. We know who we've  
got,'' said Garciaparra. ``We've been doing it through all of 
spring training and we go out there and continue it throughout the 
season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leading off for the Red Sox will be second baseman Jose  
Offerman, who signed a four-year, $26 million free agent contract 
after hitting a career-high .315 with 45 stolen bases and a 
league-leading 13 triples last year for Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a good team,'' said Garciaparra. ``For the most  
part, everybody's back. Our pitching staff's great. We'll go out 
there and see what we've got.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other newcomers for the Red Sox include Jeff Frye, who will  
start at second base, and Trot Nixon, starting in right field. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pitching is going to be a factor because of the fewer homers  
we'll hit,'' said third baseman John Valentin. 
</P>
<P>
	For the 10th straight year, the Royals will open with a new left  
fielder. Johnny Damon has moved over from center to make way for 
Beltran, who will bat leadoff. 
</P>
<P>
	And like most veterans, Damon got lost before Sunday's workout  
trying to find his way from the refurbished clubhouse to the field. 
</P>
<P>
	With new dugouts, weight rooms and managers' offices and  
expensive new seating areas alongside the dugouts, the passageways 
beneath Kauffman Stadium have been almost completely reconfigured. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to stop twice and ask directions. I really got turned  
around,'' said Damon. ``But it's great. The field looks super and 
the new facilities are terrific.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But will the new facilities, which include larger lockers and  
softer lighting in the redone clubhouse, help the Royals improve on 
a major league-worst 29-51 home record? 
</P>
<P>
	``We just feel our players deserve the same facilities as the  
other teams have,'' Royals vice president Mike Levy said. ``It 
really could lead to the guys being more competitive on the field 
if you have the proper facilities for them.''

<HEADLINE> San Fran Court Going to the Dogs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Does your neighbor's dog howl at the moon  
until 2 a.m.? Did the pit bull next door eat your hamster? Is 
little Fifi sneaking into your yard and leaving unwanted deposits 
on your lawn? 
</P>
<P>
	Don't take the law into your own hands. Take those mutts to  
court -- Dog Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, in San Francisco, justice is going to the dogs, thanks to  
police Sgt. William Herndon. He's a sort of Judge Judy for pooches 
who for the past five years has presided over Dog Court, where 
people with a bone to pick come to seek justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Herndon obviously loves dogs -- he has two -- and wants to protect  
owners' rights to their animals, as long as the city's human 
population isn't placed in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very important job,'' he said before a recent  
session began. ``I want to do right for the people, for the dogs 
and make it safe for the city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike a court for people, the dogs don't get to face their  
accusers. Instead, the folks on both sides of the issue show up, 
tell their stories -- with witnesses, if necessary -- and then, after 
a week or two, Herndon rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Occasionally an attorney shows up, but generally this is the  
most basic form of justice -- informal, casual, common sense. 
</P>
<P>
	His charter is a section of the city's health code, and the code  
says his word is final. In reality, owners can ask for a writ 
transferring the case to Superior Court, although that doesn't 
happen often. 
</P>
<P>
	Frequently, Herndon will order an alleged offender into the  
custody of the Department of Animal Care and Control for an 
evaluation by a canine behavioral expert. 
</P>
<P>
	Herndon, 45, heard three cases on a recent Thursday. The first  
two are fairly routine. In both, unleashed dogs bit other dogs, and 
Herndon tells the owners he will let them know his decision at a 
later date. 
</P>
<P>
	But the third case is serious. A young man named Sergio Guevara  
owns two pit bulls -- Buggsy and Cookie. Because of a broken-down 
fence, the dogs are able to get into a neighbor's yard. As Curtis 
Norman is shooing the dogs home, Buggsy jumps up and bites Norman's 
arm. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Norman seems willing to forgive and forget if Guevara  
fixes the fence, Arlene Norman, Curtis' wife, isn't as accepting. 
``I don't want to be attacked,'' she said with a scowl, mentioning 
visiting grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	Herndon tells Guevara to drop his dogs off at animal control by  
the end of the following day, so they can be examined by a 
behaviorist. He warns Guevara he won't get the dogs back until the 
fence is fixed. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, the story has a sad ending. While the dogs are  
being examined, Buggsy bites the behaviorist. Although the injury 
isn't severe, that's it for Buggsy -- a destruction order is issued. 
</P>
<P>
	The fate of Cookie, who didn't join the attack, was still to be  
determined. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 250 or so cases he's handled, one that sticks in  
Herndon's mind involved a 4-year-old girl who was playing with a 
stuffed animal when a dog belonging to her mother's boyfriend 
allegedly attacked, biting her in the scalp. When the mother got 
the dog off -- prying open its mouth with a broom handle -- she said 
it went back and bit her again. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mother said it was just an accident,'' Herndon said with a  
touch of disbelief in his voice. ``Even the little girl said it was 
an accident. The dog was destroyed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Does he handle any funny cases? Not many, apparently; he had to  
struggle to come up with the following: 
</P>
<P>
	``We had the case of a Jack Russell terrier who lived in a  
neighborhood where people left their doors open,'' he said. ``The 
dog got loose and ran into a neighbor's house, where he chased the 
people around. He didn't bite anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, said Herndon, that's classified as ``menacing behavior,'' a  
no-no under the city's health code.

<HEADLINE> Fernandez Returns Against Mets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Coming back from the first serious injury of his  
career, Alex Fernandez knows better than to be greedy. He's 
delighted to start on opening day, and it's OK if he doesn't 
finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez, who sat out last season following rotator cuff  
surgery, returns to the mound Monday for the Florida Marlins 
against former teammate Al Leiter and the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marlins will limit Fernandez to about 100 pitches, and  
that's fine with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like if I go out there for five or six innings, I've  
done my job, at least for now,'' he said. ``It's a long haul. It's 
not Game 7 of the World Series. I'm 29 years old, and I've got a 
lot of pitching ahead of me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not the World Series, but it will be Fernandez's first game  
since the 1997 National League championship series, when his 
career-threatening injury was diagnosed. He went 17-12 for the 
World Series champs, then spent last year on the disabled list 
while Florida plunged from first to last, losing 108 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Marlins have a new manager in John Boles and a new owner  
in John Henry, who bought the team last winter from Wayne Huizenga. 
Florida's goal this year is merely to begin the long climb toward 
contention -- or at least .500. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets, meanwhile, went on a spending spree during the winter  
and hope to make the playoffs for the first time since 1988. New 
York newcomers include Robin Ventura, Rickey Henderson and Bobby 
Bonilla, who is beginning his second stint with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Leiter will make his first start in Miami since Game 7 of the  
1997 World Series, when he helped the Marlins beat the Cleveland 
Indians. The opening day assignment is his first. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an honor,'' said Leiter, who has a home 20 minutes from  
Pro Player Stadium. ``My family and friends will be there. A lot 
will be going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, his first year with the Mets, Leiter went 17-6 with a  
2.47 ERA. The veteran left-hander struggled to an 0-4 record with a 
5.84 ERA in spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stuff-wise I feel fine,'' he said. ``I'm ready.''  
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez shares that attitude. With three seasons remaining on  
a contract that pays $7 million a year, Fernandez could provide a 
foundation for Florida's future. Or he could become trade bait. 
Either way, he was encouraged by his performance in spring 
training. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were no setbacks,'' he said. ``I was able to make every  
start. I'm pretty pleased.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez went 0-1 with a 4.32 ERA in six games, and his  
fastball clocked at 90 mph, the norm before his injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes his command isn't in midseason form, but his  
velocity is where it was in the past,'' Boles said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez will match pitches in the opener with Leiter, who went  
27-21 for Florida in 1996-97, including a no-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	``What a coincidence I've got to face Leiter,'' Fernandez said.  
``It'll be fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year wasn't a total loss for Fernandez -- in October, he and  
his wife had their fourth child. Young Andrew provides a welcome 
diversion as Fernandez braces for an emotional return to the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've tried stay away from thinking about that,'' he said. ``I  
want to worry about doing what I need to do to be ready. The 
emotions are going to carry themselves when I walk out there. 
</P>
<P>
	``And when you're changing three diapers a day, you don't think  
about that stuff.''

<HEADLINE> Drag-Queen Nuns Hold Easter Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Fishnet was big, heels were high and  
emotions ran deep as the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence -- drag 
queens dressed as nuns -- threw a 20th anniversary bash here Sunday 
despite criticism from Roman Catholics that their rituals smacked 
of heresy. 
</P>
<P>
	The typically irreverent street party -- which featured bands,  
Easter bonnets and a ``Hunky Jesus'' beauty contest -- infuriated 
church officials, who said holding the parody on Easter Sunday was 
like neo-Nazis partying on Passover. 
</P>
<P>
	But supporters of the roughly 30 sisters -- a group of faux nuns  
well-known for shimmying in Spandex to raise money for charity -- 
said they deserved to celebrate their anniversary. The sisters say 
they formed on Easter Sunday, 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message of Easter is one of resurrection,'' said Tom  
Ammiano, the president of the city's Board of Supervisors. ``I 
think that it's time in San Francisco that we resurrect that spirit 
of coexistence that has existed for the past 20 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ammiano spoke to a crowd of thousands who gathered under sunny  
skies in San Francisco's predominately gay Castro District for the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
	The board found itself dropped into a debate over the sisters  
after approving a permit that closed a city block for the party. 
</P>
<P>
	``City government has gone out of its way to associate itself  
with this ridicule and blasphemy,'' Archbishop William Levada wrote 
Friday in Catholic San Francisco, a church newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Some officials, including Mayor Willie Brown, then tried to  
rescind the permit. It didn't work, but Ammiano is expected to meet 
with Levada in a peace talk of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
	No protesters attended the party.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone is in his or her own neighborhood celebrating as he  
or she may choose,'' said Supervisor Mark Leno. ``And that 
certainly is what San Francisco is all about. We've got room for 
everybody.''

<HEADLINE> Teacher, Wife in Rebel Standoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- The high school says the teacher was  
fired for cause. The teacher says he lost his job for defending the 
``Lost Cause.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For months, St. Joseph's High School headmaster Paul Leonarczyk  
asked Winston McCuen to move a 22-square-inch Confederate battle 
flag to a less conspicuous spot in his classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	After the parents of two prospective students ``expressed  
vehement offense'' at the flag, Leonarczyk took it down himself and 
put it in McCuen's desk. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to this perceived affront to his Southern heritage,  
McCuen refused to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance at assembly. 
He was fired Jan. 22. 
</P>
<P>
	McCuen says he thought his views would be embraced at a  
conservative, Christian school in a state that still proudly flies 
the battle flag atop its capitol. As part of a growing Southern 
separatist movement, he isn't about to sell out his rebel 
ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather keep my soul than keep my job,'' says McCuen, 37,  
sitting in Tommy's Country Ham House beneath portraits of 
Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and Thomas ``Stonewall'' 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	The League of the South, a Southern nationalist group, has  
declared McCuen's firing a ``heritage violation'' and has called on 
all good ``Southrons'' to offer financial and moral support. The 
Southern Legal Resource Center is preparing a lawsuit on his 
behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just sorry that rampant political correctness seems to  
rule the roost these days,'' says Kirk Lyons of Black Mountain, 
N.C., the group's chief trial counsel. ``At some point, the people 
in South Carolina and Greenvile and the South in general are going 
to have to stand up and say, `We're sick of it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Most important to McCuen is the support of his wife, Carmen,  
whom he calls a ``true Confederate lady.'' She backs his decision, 
even though his stance leaves the couple without steady income less 
than two months before the birth of their first child. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be much more worried if he had done the wrong thing,  
and our child had found out about it and had to be ashamed of what 
his father did,'' she says, touching her husband affectionately on 
the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Both McCuens have ancestors who fought for the Confederacy. On  
the walls of their living room hang portraits of Lee and states' 
rights champion John C. Calhoun of South Carolina, as well as a 
picture of war-ravaged -- but fictional -- Tara from ``Gone With the 
Wind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're culturally different; we're culturally distinct,'' Mrs.  
McCuen, 25, says of Southerners. ``It's a past that's not to be 
ashamed of. It's a past to be proud of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Winston McCuen let St. Joseph's know up front about his  
secessionist beliefs but promised his politics would not color the 
way he taught history, government and Latin. As part of his 
contract negotiations last summer, McCuen agreed to stand for the 
pledge, provided he could substitute the phrase, ``... one nation, 
under God, divisible ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	To a classroom array of Latin posters and pull-down maps, McCuen  
added his own touches: a print of George Washington praying at 
Valley Forge; a portrait of Calhoun, the subject of McCuen's 
doctoral thesis; a 3-by-5-foot Betsy Ross flag; and the Confederate 
battle flag, which hung in a corner visible from the classroom 
door. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what all the fuss is about,'' he says, fishing the  
small piece of cloth from the back seat of his car. ``A bandana.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leonarczyk spoke with McCuen about the flag several times over  
five months. 
</P>
<P>
	``During these lengthy discussions, I first attempted to  
understand your perspective and to appreciate your conviction about 
it,'' he wrote in a memo to McCuen. 
</P>
<P>
	McCuen insists the flag was a ``teaching aid,'' much like the  
Israeli banner on the wall in a neighboring classroom. But 
Leonarczyk, in the memo, said the ``singular placement and display 
of the Confederate flag made it not a teaching tool, but a symbol 
that many find offensive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When two parents complained about the flag after an open house,  
Leonarczyk removed it. When McCuen refused to stand for the Pledge 
the next day, some students took notice and followed suit. 
Leonarczyk says McCuen's decision to discuss the issue with his 
students was ``unprofessional.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leonarczyk declined comment because of the threatened lawsuit.  
</P>
<P>
	The school's attorneys say St. Joseph's was within its rights to  
dismiss McCuen and have refused a request to reinstate him. St. 
Joseph's has also contested his claim for unemployment benefits, 
McCuen says. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons says the case goes beyond one man's firing.  
</P>
<P>
	``The issue here is, I think, there really is an ethnic  
cleansing of Confederate symbols throughout the South,'' says 
Lyons, founder of the CAUSE Foundation, which stands for Canada, 
Australia, United States, South Africa and Europe -- areas where 
Lyons considers the civil liberties of right-wing groups and 
individuals to be endangered. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, McCuen is making do by substitute teaching in the  
public school system. Mrs. McCuen took mandatory maternity leave 
from Furman University on Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	In his memo, Leonarczyk practically pleaded with McCuen to  
``consider as your first priority your responsibility to your wife 
and future son.'' McCuen says that's just what he's doing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want my son and my wife and my family to respect their  
father and husband,'' he says. ``And if I knuckle under -- if I gave 
in -- they won't. So that means you've got to stand up for 
something.''

<HEADLINE> Mexican Labor Leader Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Alfonso Sanchez Madariaga, a founder of  
Mexico's dominant labor movement, has died at age 94, newspapers 
reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanchez was one of the ``five wolf cubs,'' young labor leaders  
who split with the then-dominant labor federation in 1929 and laid 
the groundwork for what became the Mexican Labor Confederation, or 
CTM. 
</P>
<P>
	The CTM still dominates Mexico's labor movement today.  
</P>
<P>
	He remained active in the confederation as well as the Mexican  
Social Security Institute throughout his life. He died Saturday of 
a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanchez was born in Mexico City on Nov. 15, 1904. Together with  
Fidel Velazquez, he formed a milkman's union in Mexico City in 1924 
and they went on to lead the Mexico City labor confederation. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1929, they split with the dominant Regional Confederation of  
Mexican Workers and eventually founded the CTM along with Vicente 
Lombardo Toledano -- a socialist whom they later forced out of 
power. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanchez was twice a senator from Mexico City, once serving as  
Senate president. He was also a federal congressman for two terms 
and served as the CTM's delegate to numerous international labor 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his widow and five children. The funeral was  
held over the weekend.

<HEADLINE> Kazak State Won't Support Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALMATY, Kazakstan (AP) -- Signaling local economic damage from  
Russia's economic crisis, the prime minister and Central Bank chief 
of Kazakstan announced to that the state would no longer try to 
support the national currency. 
</P>
<P>
	The Central Bank has been spending its foreign reserves to try  
to prop up the currency, the tenge. Over the past six months, the 
tenge has traded fairly steadily at about 88 to the U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Prime Minister Nurlan Balgenbayev and Central Bank  
chairman Kadyrzhan Damitov said on national television Sunday that 
the Central Asian country could no longer afford to keep the tenge 
stable and that it would now be allowed to float freely. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kazakhstan's economy has started to decline, unemployment has  
increased and factories are being shut down. Trade turnover has 
been cut by $1 billion,'' Balgenbayev said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why we are making this responsible statement, being  
aware of (the impact of) our action and hoping to ... increase our 
gold and currency reserves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prime minister said that only supply and demand would  
determine the dollar rate in Kazakstan, a former Soviet republic. 
</P>
<P>
	He vowed that the country would pay its debts and that the  
government would compensate private depositors for their bank 
accounts, if they are frozen for nine months or more. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazakstan's economy remained fairly stable in the months  
following the August financial crisis that swept Russia, its 
northern neighbor and largest trade partner. Some 40 percent of 
Kazakstan's trade is with Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	But the country's economy has nonetheless declined as increasing  
numbers of enterprises are going bankrupt. More than 7 million of 
the country's 16 million people live in poverty, and unemployment 
is widespread. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Monetary Fund estimated in January that the  
global financial crises had caused Kazakstan losses equal to at 
least 5 percent of its gross domestic product. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazakstan is also heavily dependent on the sale of oil for much  
of its state revenue. With world oil prices low, the government has 
already had to revise budget projections for 1999. In February, 
President Nursultan Nazarbayev ordered the government to slash its 
expenses.

<HEADLINE> FBI Said To Probe Locker Room Tapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The FBI is investigating hidden-camera videotapes  
showing college wrestlers undressing, showering and unclothed in 
weigh-in areas at meets, including a national tournament at 
Northwestern, the Chicago Tribune reportd in its Sunday editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Images from the tapes are included in ``hidden camera''  
pornographic material that is being marketed via the Internet and 
by mail, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those familiar with the tapes, including officials at  
Northwestern and at Penn, believe the tapes were made using cameras 
concealed inside gym bags. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI is consulting with the U.S. Attorney's office on whether  
the tapes can form the basis of a prosecution under laws covering 
privacy, eavesdropping or interstate distribution of pornography, 
the Tribune reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot confirm or deny the existence of any investigation  
unless or until charges are filed,'' said Randall Samborn,

<HEADLINE> McGwire Takes Aim at His Own Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire is back at 0.  
</P>
<P>
	Now it's time to see if he can begin the way he did last year,  
when he hit an opening-day grand slam off Ramon Martinez in a 6-0 
win over the Dodgers, the first of his record 70 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure no matter what I do this year. if I don't hit 70  
someone will say I had an off year,'' McGwire said as the St. Louis 
Cardinals prepared for Monday night's opener against the Milwaukee 
Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis already has sold 2.5 million tickets -- even a couple  
hundred season tickets in the prime home-run territory out in left 
-- with fans anticipating more McGwire moon shots. 
</P>
<P>
	His career best 545-foot homer, the longest ever at Busch  
Stadium, slammed off a sign beyond the center-field backdrop that's 
now memorialized by a huge band-aid. He homered in each of the 
first four games to tie Willie Mays' major league record and 
eclipsed Roger Maris' old record of 61 with three weeks to spare. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, there's also the chase for 500. McGwire needs 43  
homers to become the 16th player in major league history to reach 
that barrier. And he could become the first player to hit 50 or 
more in four consecutive years. 
</P>
<P>
	If he hits 50, some will be disappointed.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's still a very good number,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's heroics last season enabled the Cardinals to draw 3.2  
million fans even though they were 19 games back in the NL Central 
and finished 83-79. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the team doesn't figure to be much better. The No. 1  
starter is the often-injured Donovan Osborne, who has eight 
victories the last two seasons. Center fielder Ray Lankford, who 
hits cleanup behind McGwire, and shortstop Edgar Renteria still are 
recovering from injuries sustained last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Renteria, who had a bone bruise in his right knee, has a good  
shot of starting the opener although he likely won't be stealing 
bases for a while. Renteria played Sunday in a short scrimmage 
against Fontbonne College that served as the last spring outing for 
No. 4 starter Darren Oliver. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels good,'' Renteria said. ``We worked hard to get ready.  
I'm excited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lankford, who had surgery in November to repair torn tendons in  
his left knee, likely will be placed on the 15-day disabled list. 
One of the infield backups, David Howard, injured his groin on 
Sunday and likely will go on the DL as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Milwaukee starts rookie left-hander Rafael Roque, who allowed  
home runs No. 64 to both McGwire and Sammy Sosa. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I learned something by facing both McGwire and Sosa  
last year, so I may do some things different,'' Roque said. ``I 
want to get on TV because I'm doing my job, not from giving up home 
runs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roque, who will be making only his 10th career start in the  
opener, scooted from No. 4 starter to No. 1 after Scott Karl went 
0-2 with a 7.20 ERA in four spring starts. Manager Phil Garner was 
reluctant to elevate his top pitcher, Steve Woodard, because of the 
pressure that goes with being No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with Renteria, other new faces with the Cardinals are  
heralded rookie J.D. Drew, who'll bat second in front of McGwire, 
and Eric Davis, who'll probably bat cleanup until Lankford is 
ready. 
</P>
<P>
	The top newcomers to the Brewers, seeking to end six straight  
losing seasons, are left-hander Jim Abbott and first baseman Sean 
Berry. 
</P>
<P>
	The opening three-game series has two interesting subplots. The  
Cardinals are still trying to make a deal for disgruntled Brewers 
second baseman Fernando Vina, with the holdup so far St. Louis' 
reluctance to part with promising right-hander Jose Jimenez. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not the GM, but I certainly don't think we'll trade him,''  
Cardinals pitching coach Dave Duncan. 
</P>
<P>
	The second wrinkle is whether Cardinals manager Tony La Russa  
continues to bat his pitcher eighth. He said Sunday that Osborne 
will bat ninth in the opener. St. Louis was 46-36 last year with 
the pitcher hitting eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's there if it ever makes sense,'' La Russa said, ``but I  
don't think we need to do it tomorrow.''

<HEADLINE> Low-Key Rally Marks MLK's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- One year after 4,000 marchers stretched  
six blocks to mark the 30th anniversary of the death of Martin 
Luther King Jr., a scant 15 showed up Sunday to remember the slain 
civil rights leader. 
</P>
<P>
	The 31st anniversary rally, sponsored by the Memphis chapter of  
the NAACP youth council, featured chants, songs and speeches. The 
group stood under the balcony of The Lorraine Motel, where King was 
assassinated in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	``Society can be reborn again if we can stop violence and stop  
the hate,'' said 15-year-old Aren Cowan, the council's vice 
president, in one speech. She noted this was the first year the 
anniversary has fallen on an Easter Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The motel is now the site of the National Civil Rights Museum,  
where many visitors were unaware of the day's significance as they 
wandered upon the afternoon rally. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't know anything about it,'' said Ruth Johnson of  
Huntsville, Ala. ``We were just here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kim Peters, a teacher from Fredericksburg, Va., said King is  
among the famous black Americans her classes discuss during 
February's black history month. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to see this. ... We had no idea that anything like  
this was going on,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The low-key rally was a stark contrast to the 30th anniversary,  
when thousands of marchers, led by the Rev. Jesse Jackson and 
Memphis Mayor W.W. Herenton, sang ``We Shall Overcome'' and other 
standards from the civil rights movement and carried pictures of 
King and signs saying, ``Remember the Man and the Message.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in Memphis, several multiracial community worship  
services Sunday remembered King's life and death while celebrating 
Easter. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was 2,000 years ago that Jesus of Nazareth died on Calvary.  
And this place we call Memphis is a kind of Calvary because a man 
of God died at The Lorraine Motel 31 years ago today,'' said Rev. 
Bill AdKins, pastor of the Greater Imani Church and Christian 
Center in a morning service at the Mid-South Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	King was slain in Memphis while helping organize a strike by  
city sanitation workers. He was standing on the balcony of The 
Lorraine when he was felled by a single rifle slug. 
</P>
<P>
	James Earl Ray, a prison escapee from Missouri, pleaded guilty  
to killing King and was sentenced to 99 years in prison. He later 
recanted. Sunday's anniversary was the first since Ray died last 
April of liver disease at age 70.

<HEADLINE> `The Matrix' Debuts At No. 1 / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``The Matrix,'' a futuristic, special  
effects-filled action movie starring Keanu Reeves, debuted atop the 
weekend box office, dominating fellow newcomers ``10 Things I Hate 
About You'' and ``The Out-Of-Towners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starring Reeves as a computer hacker who discovers life is a big  
illusion, ``The Matrix'' grossed $27.6 million for the biggest 
opening weekend this year, industry estimates showed Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was also the best opening for Reeves since 1994, when  
``Speed'' had $14.5 million in its debut. 
</P>
<P>
	``10 Things I Hate About You,'' an updated, teen-centered  
version of the Shakespearean classic ``The Taming of the Shrew,'' 
was a distant second with $8.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Out-Of-Towners,'' a loose remake of the 1970 comedy about  
an out-of-town couple in New York City starring Steve Martin and 
Goldie Hawn, was third with $8.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Analyze This'' and ``Forces of Nature'' tied for fourth with  
$6.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``EDtv,'' about a video store clerk who agrees to let television  
capture every minute of his life, dropped to sixth place after 
losing 45 percent of its audience in its second week. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Oscar winners remained in the top 10. ``Shakespeare in  
Love'' was seventh with $3.3 million, while ``Life is Beautiful'' 
was No. 9 with $2.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Sunday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final figures 
to be released Monday: 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``The Matrix,'' $27.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``10 Things I Hate About You,'' $8.7 million.

<HEADLINE> Expos-Pirates in Low-Wage Opener  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Montreal Expos and Pittsburgh Pirates have  
something in common other than minimum-wage payrolls, cavernous 
stadiums and a shared belief they can be the NL's surprise team 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	It's called opening day.  
</P>
<P>
	They no longer play in the same division and they haven't had  
much of a rivalry since the 1970s. No matter, the NL schedule maker 
still keeps matching them on opening day. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates' Francisco Cordova (13-14, 3.31 ERA) opposes the  
Expos' Dustin Hermanson (14-11, 3.13 ERA) in a sold-out Three 
Rivers Stadium Monday night in the second Pirates-Expos opener in 
as many seasons. It also will be the sixth time in 11 years the 
Pirates have opened at home with Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	Parlez-vous francais, Pittsburgh?  
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, you don't care who you play, you just want to start  
playing,'' first baseman Kevin Young said. ``It's time to jet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates beat the Expos 4-0 behind Cordova on opening day  
last season, but won only 68 more times amid a disappointing year 
that saw them lose 25 of their final 30. The Expos were even worse, 
going 65-97 with the majors' smallest payroll. 
</P>
<P>
	Call it the eternal optimism that abounds every spring, even in  
an era when finances are dividing baseball into the haves and 
have-nots. But the Expos and Pirates are convinced 1998 was a 
stepping stone to a better future, not a step backward. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates' late-season collapse convinced general manager Cam  
Bonifay to augment a youth-driven rebuilding project with 
experience, and he brought in five new position players. 
</P>
<P>
	Four will start Monday: left fielder Brian Giles, center fielder  
Brant Brown, third baseman Ed Sprague and shortstop Mike Benjamin. 
Shortstop Pat Meares also would have started, but is out with a 
sprained left wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, rookie second baseman Warren Morris makes the leap from  
Double-A to the majors after hitting four homers during the 
Pirates' first winning spring since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The makeover means the Pirates will no longer do their  
on-the-job training on the major league level (third baseman Aramis 
Ramirez started last season at age 19). It also has created more 
optimism since the Pirates last won a division title in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Is it false optimism? The Pirates are convinced it's not.  
</P>
<P>
	With good starting pitching, an upgraded defense and more  
leadership, they believe they can sneak up in a division where no 
team has a competition-busting $85 million payroll like the Yankees 
do. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a chance to be real, real good if we perform up to our  
capabilities,'' Bonifay said. 
</P>
<P>
	They have a chance for a quick getaway. They start the season  
with a nine-game homestand, including three games each against the 
NL Central rivals Chicago and St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Expos' optimism, as always, results from a farm system that  
keeps turning out excellent prospects almost as fast as they can 
leave for organizations that can afford them. 
</P>
<P>
	Right fielder Vladimir Guerrero (.324, 38 homers, 109 RBIs)  
certainly is a keeper, the cornerstone of the franchise and a 
player who might be only one more big year away from being regarded 
as the NL's best overall player. 
</P>
<P>
	Center fielder Rondell White was on track for a 30 homers-30  
steals year until breaking a finger in June. First baseman Brad 
Fullmer had 44 doubles as a rookie. Ugeth Urbina is an excellent 
closer who might have even more save opportunities if the Expos had 
better middle relief. 
</P>
<P>
	Hermanson could become the Expos' first 20-game winner since  
Ross Grimsley in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've going to surprise a lot of people,'' said Hermanson, who  
tuned up for Monday's start with five strong innings Wednesday 
against the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	The surprise would be if the Expos, who will pay their 25-man  
roster slightly less than the $15 million average annual salary of 
the Dodgers' Kevin Brown, can stay in contention in the NL East 
alongside big spenders Atlanta and the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a lot of talent,'' said manager Felipe Alou, who  
turned down the Dodgers so he could finish out the Expos' seemingly 
endless rebuilding project. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Meares still hopes to be ready by Friday. ... The sellout  
is the Pirates' third in a row on opening day. ... The Pirates were 
7-2 against Montreal last season. ... The combined 134 victories by 
the Expos and Pirates last season were only nine more than the 
Yankees had by themselves in the regular and postseason. ... 
Cordova was 2-0 with a 1.29 ERA against Montreal last season. ... 
Wednesday's game was moved to an afternoon start so the Pirates can 
break ground that evening on PNC Park, which will open in 2001.

	INDIAN SPRINGS, Nev. (AP) -- A medical helicopter crashed in  
snowy weather after taking a patient to a hospital, killing the 
pilot and two nurses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Euro BO-105 helicopter had taken someone to Valley Hospital  
Medical Center in Las Vegas, which operates the Flight for Life air 
ambulance program. During the flight back to their base in Pahrump, 
the crew failed to make a radio check-in at about 11:30 p.m. 
Saturday, hospital officials said.

	The twin-engine aircraft was reported down at about 12:10 a.m.  
Sunday near Indian Springs, 35 miles northwest of Las Vegas, said 
Jerry Acosta, a duty officer with the Federal Aviation 
Administration in Los Angeles. 
</P>

	The 26-year-old left-hander, who has been bothered by a sore  
elbow, isn't expected to miss more than one or two starts. Pettitte 
was 16-11 last year with a 4.24 ERA.

<P>
	The Yankees, who open the season Monday in Oakland, made several  
other moves Saturday to get down to the 25-man opening day roster 
limit.

<P>
	They placed right-handers Darrel Einertson and Mike Jerzembeck  
on the 15-day disabled list retroactive to March 26; optioned 
right-handers Ryan Bradley, Jay Tessmer and Ben Ford to Triple-A 
Columbus, and purchased the contracts of infielder Clay Bellinger 
and right-hander Jason Grimsley. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley started the Yankees' final exhibition game against the  
Los Angeles Dodgers on Sunday and was ineffective, allowing four 
hits and five runs in one-third of an inning.

<HEADLINE> Small Town Rebuilds After Tornado </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPENCER, S.D. (AP) -- Almost wiped off the map 10 months ago by a  
killer tornado, this prairie town is a checkerboard today -- new 
homes alternating with bare tracts of land where houses and 
businesses exploded into splinters of wood the size of 
half-dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents trying to rebuild caught a break this winter, with  
temperatures mild enough to allow home-building and other 
construction to continue. A normal winter would have stopped 
progress in its snowy tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a lot of rebuilding to do. But it'll work,'' says  
Mayor Rocky Kirby, 65, who has lived in Spencer since 1953. ``Crews 
were on the roofs putting shingles on. They would have had to stop 
if the winter had been raging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Every month this winter was warmer than normal. February's  
average temperature was almost 30 degrees, 10 degrees above 
average, says Mike Fuhs, a meteorologist with the National Weather 
Service in Sioux Falls. 
</P>
<P>
	Flower bulbs have yet to peek through the chilly soil, and the  
trees are still bare of green. But spring is in the air. Last 
spring, on May 30, a tornado with wind estimated at 260 mph 
destroyed all but 30 of Spencer's 186 buildings. The twister killed 
six people and injured 150, half of what was then the town's 
population of 320. 
</P>
<P>
	Surrounded by fields of corn and soybeans and pastures for  
livestock, Spencer was settled in the 1880s as a railroad stop. 
Like many tiny towns on the Great Plains, Spencer had been 
struggling long before May 30. 
</P>
<P>
	The population was aging. The school, movie house and lumber  
yard had closed. Many people were sure the tornado would be the end 
of Spencer. 
</P>
<P>
	But thanks to $5 million in government aid and private  
donations, 22 new homes have gone up since the tornado. A new bank 
and two apartment buildings should be complete by May 1. The new 
fire station, library and post office will open in late summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the town never recovered its already dwindling  
population. Kirby estimates 140 residents are left. 
</P>
<P>
	Most who moved away were elderly. Some went to live with  
relatives in other towns or other states. Others moved into 
apartments in nearby Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
	The town's average age was 65-70 before the tornado. Now the  
average age is 50, Kirby guesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who wants to rebuild at 80 years old? You'd never see the end  
of it,'' says Kirby's wife, Juanita. 
</P>
<P>
	Planners say the rebuilding of Spencer can be a model for  
invigorating rural communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of that restoration will start late this month. The tornado  
shredded many of Spencer's trees, so on Arbor Day, April 30, state 
forestry officials will kick off a three-year program to plant 
2,000 trees and shrubs. 
</P>
<P>
	The trees will be strategically planted to reduce wind, curb  
snow drifts and help cool the town in summer, says John Ball, an 
associate professor with South Dakota State University's department 
of forestry, horticulture, landscape and parks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a lot of beautiful trees planted 80 to 100 years ago,''  
Kirby says. ``Ash, elms, a few cottonwoods, beautiful big shade 
trees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Kirbys are confident that, as more houses go up and new  
trees are planted, former residents will return and new families 
will move in. 
</P>
<P>
	``They like living in a little town,'' Mrs. Kirby said. ``They  
don't want to send their kids to a big school.''

<HEADLINE> Duke Coach Undergoes Hip Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski underwent  
successful hip-replacement surgery today and should be released 
from the hospital within five days. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. T. Parker Vail, an orthopedic surgeon at Duke University  
Hospital who performed the surgery, said the 52-year-old Krzyzewski 
should be walking on crutches in the next couple days. 
</P>
<P>
	``The surgery went really well from the beginning,'' Vail said.  
``He was anticipating the operation and looking forward to it. 
There were really no problems. His hip fits quite stable and moves 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vail began the two-hour procedure about 9 a.m. He said  
Krzyzewski's left hip cartilage had eroded inside the socket joint 
to the point where bone was rubbing against bone. Krzyzewski was 
fitted with a hip made of polyethylene, a metal alloy, and no 
cement adhesive was needed to keep the joint in place. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very happy with the outcome,'' said Vail. ``This  
procedure is categorized as a major operation because of the 
magnitude of the surgery. He remains very upbeat and optimistic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski's wife, Mickie, also attended the news conference.  
She said she called senior guard Trajan Langdon after the surgery 
and said he would inform the team that the procedure went 
successfully. 
</P>
<P>
	A Duke web site set up during the Final Four was peppered with  
criticism from fans, but many of the comments were from 
well-wishers concerned about the surgery, Mickie Krzyzewski said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're really grateful to the people who obviously love that  
guy -- me being one,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickie Krzyzewski said Coach K has been bothered by the  
arthritic left hip since he had back surgery during the 1994-95 
season. Krzyzewski missed 19 games that season but Vail said no 
specific event triggered the deterioration of the hip. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a little young to develop arthritis, but because he's  
real active it became a problem,'' Vail said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vail said pain is the number one factor that is evaluated before  
a surgery like this. ``And wrapped up in that pain is quality of 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vail is an associate professor of surgery in the Division of  
Orthopedic Surgery. He is also the medical director of the 
Orthopedic Private Diagnostic Clinic, is on the graduate faculty in 
Duke's School of Engineering and is a consulting surgeon at four 
other medical facilities.

<HEADLINE> Big-Money Free Agents Match Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- It was a dream matchup last fall, when they  
squared off in the opener of the NL division series between the 
Houston Astros and San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, pitching for different teams and big, big money, Randy  
Johnson of the Arizona Diamondbacks and Kevin Brown of the Los 
Angeles Dodgers oppose each other again in the highlight among 
Monday's 11 season openers. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson vs. Brown. The Big Unit and his blazing fastball against  
the sidewinding Georgian and his nasty slider. 
</P>
<P>
	Runs will certainly be at a premium.  
</P>
<P>
	``If I was going to go to an opening day, ours is the one I'd go  
to,'' said Todd Hundley, who will also make his debut with the 
Dodgers as Brown's catcher. ``If you're a fan of offense, that's 
not the game to go to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The final score when Johnson and Brown pitched against each  
other last Oct. 17? 
</P>
<P>
	Big surprise -- 2-1, Padres.  
</P>
<P>
	``Imagine that,'' Hundley said with a smile.  
</P>
<P>
	The game at Dodger Stadium has been a sellout for weeks, and  
much anticipated since Johnson signed a $52.4 million, four-year 
contract with Arizona on Nov. 30, and Brown became baseball's 
richest player when he signed a $105 million, seven-year deal with 
with the Dodgers 12 days later. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good for baseball, to have two of the most dominant  
pitchers in the game throw against each other on opening day,'' Los 
Angeles second baseman Eric Young said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll be a good matchup,'' Dodgers center fielder Devon White  
said. ``You just have to go up there and do your job. With a guy 
like Randy Johnson, not too many guys go up there and do their 
job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Johnson has been baseball's dominant left-hander in the  
1990s, mostly with the Seattle Mariners, Brown has been one of the 
toughest right-handers, especially the last three years, when he's 
gone 51-26 with a major league-best 2.33 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, who helped the Florida Marlins and Padres reach the World  
Series in the last two years, was 18-7 with a 2.38 ERA in 1998 and 
could become the first pitcher to appear in three consecutive World 
Series with three different teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson , 10-1 with a 1.28 ERA after the Astros acquired him  
from Seattle last July 31, said he still feels honored to pitch on 
opening day and expects a playoff-type environment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in that atmosphere, whether it's been in the  
playoffs or the All-Star games,'' he said. ``I have a job to do and 
I don't get caught up in all of that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've faced him once before and just thought it was a very  
well-pitched game by both of us, and I'm imagining it's going to be 
the same thing on opening day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Johnson, Brown said he's looking forward to his opening-day  
assignment, but played down the duel with Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not pitching against him, although I'll face him at least  
a couple times,'' Brown said. ``I've got to get those other guys 
out. My job's still the same. I'm as ready to go as I'm going to 
get. It's getting close.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams are looking for great improvement this year thanks in  
great part to their new pitching aces. 
</P>
<P>
	However, their goals are quite different.  
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks are hoping for significant improvement in just  
their second year of existence, while the retooled Dodgers are 
favorites in the NL West and appear to have an excellent 
opportunity to win their first playoff game since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks good on paper,'' Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone  
said. ``Championships are won on the field, not on paper. It's a 
long journey. We'll see how it works out.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* In honor of his 50th season as play-by-play voice of the  
Dodgers, Hall of Fame broadcaster Vin Scully will throw out the 
ceremonial first pitch prior to the game.

<HEADLINE> Coles Says He'll Run Olympic Leg </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Embattled International Olympic  
Committee member Phil Coles plans to run the Olympic torch for one 
kilometer across Sydney's Bondi Beach regardless of the outcome of 
any inquiries into his conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	The Daily Telegraph reported Monday that Coles had accepted an  
invitation from new Torch Relay Committee chairwoman Anna Booth to 
take on the relay leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles is under investigation by the IOC over claims he accepted  
jewelry worth more than $6,300 from the Athens bid committee for 
the 1996 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The Telegraph said Olympics Minister Michael Knight, who last  
week removed Coles as head of the relay committee, would not 
attempt to stop the former Olympic kayaker from participating. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles said Booth's invitation was ``gracious,'' and said it  
would be an honor to complete the leg, which is minutes from his 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is something I have always dreamed of since we won the  
games,'' he said. ``I was delighted to take up the offer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Knight has repeatedly called for Coles to resign from the  
Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games, the body last 
year voted unanimously to allow every living Olympian to 
participate in the relay.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- David Brooks, an actor, director and producer  
who starred in the leading role of Tommy Albright in the Broadway 
musical ``Brigadoon,'' died Wednesday. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks debuted on Broadway in 1945 in the musical comedy

23 years made the department into one of the nation's largest, died 
Sunday at home. He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitchess, appointed sheriff in 1958, saw the department expand

<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Alfonso Sanchez Madariaga, a founder of  
Mexico's dominant labor movement, died Saturday of a heart attack. 
He was 94. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanchez was one of the ``five wolf cubs,'' young labor leaders  
who split with the then-dominant labor federation in 1929 and laid 
the groundwork for what became the Mexican Labor Confederation, or 
CTM. 
</P>
<P>
	The CTM still dominates Mexico's labor movement today.  
</P>
<P>
	He remained active in the confederation as well as the Mexican  
Social Security Institute throughout his life. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanchez, born in Mexico City, began his labor career when he  
helped form a milkman's union there in 1924. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanchez was twice a senator from Mexico City, once serving as  
Senate president. He was also a federal congressman for two terms.

	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Irene Samuel, who fought to reopen  
Little Rock public schools after they were closed to prevent 
desegregation, died Saturday. She was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1958, Gov. Orval E. Faubus and the Legislature called a  
special election that closed schools to prevent further 
desegregation. Ms. Samuel was one of 58 women who formed the 
Women's Emergency Committee to Open Our Schools. She became unpaid 
executive secretary and chief strategist for the group. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools re-opened a year later, and Ms. Samuel worked  
unsuccessfully to get Faubus out of office. He served three more 
terms, choosing not to seek re-election in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1970, she helped Dale Bumpers get elected governor, and  
served as his administrative assistant in Little Rock and during 
the first of his four U.S. Senate terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Samuel grew up in Little Rock, a daughter of a railroad  
switchman, and after graduating in 1931 worked for the federal 
Public Housing Authority in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1939, she moved back to Little Rock and married Dr. John  
Samuel, a surgeon. Their son was in grade school when the Little 
Rock desegregation crisis broke out.

<P>
	BREMERTON, Wash. (AP) -- Robert E. Webb, believed to be the  
Navy's oldest retired chief petty officer, died Thursday at age 
100. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb, a native of Greenville, Miss., whose grandparents were  
slaves, served in World Wars I and II and was chief steward for six 
admirals. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb was working in a rubber plant in Akron, Ohio, when a Navy  
poster caught his eye in 1918 and he enlisted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hadn't seen nothing but the Mississippi River,'' he said in  
an interview last May. 
</P>
<P>
	While stationed in France in World War I, he survived the  
sinking of his boat in a German attack. After the war ended, Webb 
became a cook and went on to prepare food for dignitaries and 
diplomats from around the world. In the 1930s, he served aboard the 
historic sailing ship USS Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	His service took him around the world three times and he  
attained the rank of master chief, an almost unheard-of 
accomplishment for blacks before the military was desegregated. 
</P>
<P>
	He settled in Bremerton, where he married in 1944. Three years  
later he left the military and took a civilian job at the Puget 
Sound Naval Shipyard. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include a daughter and two grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Lawless Talks About Lesbian Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Xena and Seven of Nine are two completely  
different television characters on two completely different shows. 
But they apparently share a common fan base: lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucy Lawless, who plays the title character on ``Xena, Princess  
Warrior,'' says lesbians gave the show its initial buzz. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lesbians were our first fans, especially the lesbian  
community in New York City. They really gave Xena a groove,'' 
Lawless tells the April 10 edition of TV Guide. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeri Ryan, who plays the half-human, half-Borg Seven of Nine on  
``Star Trek: Voyager,'' says there was a petition drive on the 
Internet to turn Seven into a lesbian. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then somebody issues a fake press release announcing it was  
going to happen. Then all the fans got disappointed when it didn't. 
Well, not everyone. I don't know that mainstream America is ready 
for it. But who knows?''

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Eight inmates were shot and killed in a  
high-security Bogota prison in what was believed to be a settling 
of scores between two rival gangs, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The killings occurred during an hourlong melee that broke out  
Saturday night in one of the eight cellblocks at La Modelo prison, 
an overcrowded penitentiary that holds some 3,800 inmates, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The prison's director, Liliana Obregon, told reporters the  
killings were still under investigation. She said it was not known 
how the weapons used had entered the prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite searches that Obregon said are routine for anyone  
entering La Modelo, guns and knives -- along with virtually anything 
else -- are frequently smuggled into even Colombia's highest 
security prisons. Poorly paid prison guards are highly susceptible 
to bribes. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims had been imprisoned for crimes including armed  
robbery and theft, officials said.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- The Dalai Lama arrived in Brazil  
on Sunday, saying he was optimistic about the situation of Tibet in 
China. 
</P>
<P>
	``In spite of all the sadness, I think that things are changing  
for the better,'' the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader told 
reporters, on his second trip to Brazil since a 1992 conference on 
the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dalai Lama, who has pressed China for Tibetan autonomy but  
not outright independence, wore the customary scarlet robe of a 
Buddhist monk. He was met by flower-bearing followers at his first 
stop in Curitiba, located 500 miles south of Rio de Janeiro. 
</P>
<P>
	During his four-day visit, the 63-year-old spiritual leader  
participate in seminars and speeches and meet religious figures, 
politicians and artists in Curitiba and the capital, Brasilia, 
where he will also address the Congress. 
</P>

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- A severe drought in northeast  
Brazil caused infant mortality to increase slightly last year, 
according to a health ministry report published Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The report shows that 32,407 infants nationwide -- 12,019 in the  
northeast -- died last year, up from 31,602 in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Alagoas, a northeastern sugar growing state, led the nation with  
a rate of 86.8 deaths per 1,000 births, double the national 
average. 
</P>
<P>
	Most deaths are due to malnutrition, respiratory infections and  
diarrhea, said the report published in the Folha de Sao Paulo 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	The northeast, an arid region larger than any country in Western  
Europe, experiences a major drought every dozen years or so. In the 
early 1980s, more than 350,000 people died in a prolonged drought, 
and malnutrition affects 40 percent of the area's children.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A moderate eruption shook the crater of the  
Popocatepetl volcano early Sunday, but officials said it quickly 
calmed. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion appears to be one in a series over recent months  
that seismologists believe has released pressure as it builds up 
within the 17,925-foot mountain, some 40 miles southeast of Mexico 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion just before dawn was heard by people in San Andres  
Calpan, about 12 miles from the crater, according to the National 
Center for the Prevention of Disasters.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Luis M. Farias, a founder of Mexico's radio  
announcers union who served a governor and senator, has died at 78, 
newspapers reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Farias died Saturday while vacationing with his family at  
Cocoyoc, south of Mexico City. The cause of death was not reported, 
but he had suffered from Parkinson's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Farias was born in Monterrey on June 7, 1920, and went on to  
earn a law degree from the National Autonomous University in Mexico 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	He worked as a radio announcer for what was then Mexico's top  
radio station, XEW, and formed a union there. He later helped found 
a national union of broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party and  
served as governor of his native Nuevo Leon state from 1970 to 
1973. He was a federal congressman for three terms -- 1955-58, 
1967-70 and 1979-82, as well as senator in 1970 and from 1973 to 
1976.

<HEADLINE> FBI Wraps Up Search at Texas Ranch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP WOOD, Texas (AP) -- The FBI on Sunday wrapped up a three-day  
search at a south Texas cattle ranch for clues to the disappearance 
of atheist leader Madalyn Murray O'Hair, but declined to say 
whether they found anything. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not going to comment on whether we gathered evidence or  
not,'' Robert Grant, assistant special agent in charge of the FBI's 
San Antonio office, said Sunday. ``We came here to find evidence 
and we'll leave it at that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI has refused to confirm the subject of the investigation,  
but the Texas Department of Public Safety said Saturday it was 
helping federal agents in a search for evidence in the 1995 
disappearance of Mrs. O'Hair; her son, Jon Garth Murray; 
granddaughter, Robin Murray O'Hair; and $500,000 in gold coins. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are assisting the FBI, searching for evidence related to  
the Madalyn Murray O'Hair case,'' said DPS spokesman Tom Vinger. 
``That doesn't mean they're looking for bodies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI used dogs, heavy equipment including a backhoe and a  
helicopter with night vision to search about 1,000 acres of the 
5,000-acre Cooksy Ranch, about 100 miles west of San Antonio in 
Real County. The U.S. Attorney's office said the ranch owners were 
not targets of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. O'Hair's 1963 Supreme Court case led to the ban on  
organized prayer in public schools. She founded American Atheists 
Inc., a nonprofit group dedicated to the separation of church and 
state which was based for many years in Austin. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, David R. Waters, 52, the former office manager for  
Mrs. O'Hair, and Gary P. Karr, 50, were arrested on weapons 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Waters has denied involvement in the O'Hairs' disappearance, and  
neither man has been charged in connection with the case.

	Albright Takes Aim at Milosevic  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright today  
blamed the burgeoning refugee crisis in the Balkans on Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic, whose forces have continued attacks 
on ethnic Albanian and forced them out of Kosovo. Albright, 
appearing on NBC, dismissed the suggestion that the NATO air 
campaign led to the crisis. Meanwhile a Pentagon spokesman said it 
was ``encouraging'' that the Yugoslav government will treat three 
captured U.S. soldiers as prisoners-of-war, which could protect 
them from trial.

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Air raid sirens sounded tonight in  
Belgrade, signaling the start of a 12th night of NATO airstrikes on 
Yugoslavia, as NATO warplanes and missiles pounded targets in and 
around the city earlier in the day. The Tanjug state news agency 
said that NATO attacks on an oil refinery at Pancevo, northeast of 
Belgrade, killed two workers and injured four, while a 73-year-old 
woman died and seven people were injured in an attack on Cacak, an 
industrial town 50 miles south of the capital. Three people were 
injured when a fuel depot near the town of Kraljevo, some 75 miles 
south of Belgrade, was also hit, Yugoslav news reports said.

counsel, Hans Corell, had left for Europe on Friday on his way to 
Libya to arrange the handover. Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, 42 and Abdel

after the Mormons moved West. The temple was dedicated in 1846

companies declined for the first time in seven years in 1998. U.S. 
companies suffered the effects of the economic crisis in Asia, 
Russia and Latin America, as profits for the 500 fell 1.8 percent

<HEADLINE> Diallo Shooting Spurs D.C. March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *Campaign against police brutality arrives in Washington    	
</P>
<P>
 *With AP Photo    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Protesters against police brutality turned  
their attention from New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to 
President Clinton on Saturday as some 2,500 demonstrators marched 
in Washington calling for the president and Congress to help combat 
police abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Demonstrators gathered outside the Martin Luther King Jr.  
Library and walked about one mile to the steps of the Capitol 
chanting ``no justice no peace, no more racist police'' and ``let's 
stop the Klan in blue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the rally was intended to call for changes to abusive  
police practices nationwide it was spurred by the shooting of 
Amadou Diallo, which has riveted national attention on the troubled 
New York City Police Department. Buttons, T-shirts, fliers and 
posters with Diallo's picture or name were everywhere in the sea of 
demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd frequently erupted into simple cries of ``Amadou.''  
</P>
<P>
	Four New York City police officers were arraigned on  
second-degree murder charges in Diallo's death last week. The 
officers fired 41 shots at the unarmed West African immigrant, 
hitting him 19 times. The shooting set off a wave of protests in 
New York City at which some 1,200 people were arrested on civil 
disobedience charges for blocking access to police headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for the Manhattan District Attorney's Office said  
Saturday those protesters would likely not be prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
	The organizer of those protests, the Rev. Al Sharpton, received  
a rousing welcome at the sun-drenched Washington rally as he 
arrived in the late afternoon with members of the Diallo family. 
</P>
<P>
	Bellowing from the Capitol steps, Sharpton announced a national  
tour against police brutality and called for a national day of 
civil disobedience outside police headquarters where abuses had 
been documented 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpton also said Clinton's March 12 radio address, in which  
the president talked about police integrity, was not enough. And he 
spoke of widespread black support for the president during the 
Monica Lewinsky scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't you turn deaf ears Mr. President. You're there 'cause we  
stood for you. Now it's time that you stood for us,'' Sharpton 
said. ``You can't preach morality in Yugoslavia and allow police to 
kill in New York City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpton said he wants the president to meet with the families  
of people killed by police and called on Clinton to appoint a 
special prosecutor to investigate police brutality. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally came as the highest ranking member of New York City  
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's administration told the mayor he had been 
harassed by the police for what he believed were racial reasons, 
according to the New York Times. Deputy Mayor Rudy Washington told 
Giuliani he had been bullied and intimidated by police on more than 
one occasion, the Times reported.

<HEADLINE> Vaughn Is Star for Reds' Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Greg Vaughn has only a vague recollection of  
his first opening day in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a lot of people. It was a little cold. I don't  
remember too much else,'' Vaughn said, thinking back to one year 
ago. ``I remember the elephants pooping all over the place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reds fans are hoping Vaughn gives them more pleasant memories on  
Monday afternoon. Elephants again will parade during pregame 
festivities, but Vaughn will be the star attraction when the Reds 
take the field in new uniforms and facial hair -- one change 
prompted by Vaughn -- to play San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, another California team -- the San Diego Padres -- came  
to Cincinnati and got a 10-2 win that launched one of the best 
seasons in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn was the only Padres starter who didn't have a hit that  
day. He got to make it two Cincinnati openers in a row when the 
Padres traded him to the Reds for Reggie Sanders on Feb. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Due in large part to that trade, the opener sold out faster than  
it had in six years and Reds fans are talking about playoff 
possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fans are getting excited about it and they should be,''  
pitcher Denny Neagle said Sunday before a workout at Cinergy Field. 
``We said all spring training we feel we have a special team here 
that can do something this year. Hopefully, we can go out there and 
put on a good show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's opener was the Reds' worst showing in a generation.  
Pokey Reese made four errors, tying the record for a shortstop on 
opening day, and the eight-run loss was their most lopsided 
opening-day defeat in 36 years. 
</P>
<P>
	That loss came only a few hours after the Reds traded their No.  
1 starter, Dave Burba, to Cleveland, a move that told fans there 
was no reason to hope for the playoffs. After the game, owner Marge 
Schott fell in the driveway of her home and broke her hip. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn may have the best chance to point this opener in a  
different direction. Vaughn is 5-for-13 career against Giants 
starter Mark Gardner (13-6), and all five hits have been homers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't pay attention to whether I've had success against  
somebody or not,'' Vaughn said. ``If I've got a bat in my hand, 
I've got a chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brett Tomko, the Reds' No. 3 pitcher when spring training began,  
will make his first opening day start because Neagle is on the 
disabled list with shoulder weakness and Pete Harnisch has been 
slowed by a bad back. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomko (13-12) figures it will be much like last Aug. 6, when he  
started before a capacity crowd in St. Louis and kept Mark McGwire 
stuck on 60 homers for one more day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pitched in that game when he was about to break the record.  
That was a pretty intense thing,'' Tomko said Sunday. ``I imagine 
it will be kind of the same feeling, the same atmosphere -- except 
the crowd will be rooting for me, hopefully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants are looking to follow the Padres' example and get a  
good feeling about themselves from Day 1. San Francisco came as 
close as possible to making the playoffs last season, losing a 
one-game playoff to the Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe from the bottom of my heart that this is supposed to  
be our year,'' manager Dusty Baker said. ``No explanation. I just 
feel it. I just think we've got a lot of things going in our 
favor.''

	U.S. To Send Helicopters to Albania  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon has agreed to send 24 Apache  
helicopter gunships and 2,000 troops to Albania, deepening 
America's military commitment in the Balkans. The Clinton 
administration said today that the Apaches would give NATO the 
ability to directly attack Serb soldiers and tanks in Yugoslavia. 
Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said deploying the Apaches was ``a 
logical expansion'' of the nearly two-week-old NATO airstrikes to 
halt Yugoslav Slobodan Milosevic's military drive against ethnic 
Albanians in the Serbian province of Kosovo. 

</P>

	Lawmakers Urge Use of Troops  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., today said it was  
time for Congress to consider a vote on the use of U.S. ground 
troops in Kosovo. He joined several other lawmakers from both 
parties in urging President Clinton not to rule out the option of 
sending combat forces into the Serbian province. The 
no-ground-troops stand only emboldens Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic into pressing his attack against ethnic Albanians, 
lawmakers said.

	PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- In a show of anger at NATO, some  
10,000 Montenegrins jammed a central square in their capital 
tonight to protest the alliance's air strikes on the region. The 
peaceful demonstration marked the biggest outpouring yet of 
anti-NATO sentiment in the tense Yugoslav republic. Montenegro's 
pro-Western authorities stepped up security around key buildings 
out of fear an eruption of violence could spark attacks on their 
government.

The tornado, believed to be about a half-mile wide, curved through

Palmetto Park. A separate tornado destroyed a church southwest of 
Shreveport near the Texas border.

wearing riot gear were called into quell the Easter Sunday violence

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Profits at the Fortune 500 companies declined  
for the first time in seven years in 1998 as the economic crisis in 
Asia, Russia and Latin America took its toll on U.S. firms. Profits 
fell 1.8 percent last year, compared to 7.8 percent earnings growth 
in 1997, according to Fortune magazine's annual listing of the 
largest U.S. public companies. Revenue growth shrank to 4 percent 
from 8.7 percent in 1997 as U.S. companies found demand for their 
products and services stifled by the ongoing financial problems 
overseas. General Motors remained No. 1 for the 11th straight year

Toronto Blue Jays to the Yankees in mid-February for pitchers David 
Wells and Graeme Lloyd and second baseman Homer Bush. Because he'll 
be wearing the team's road grays, he won't start in the famed 
pinstripes until Saturday against Detroit.

<HEADLINE> Chemicals Could Create No-Mow Lawn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *MICHAEL PEARSON   	
</P>
<P>
	CARBONDALE, Ill. (AP) -- Dale Palscher doesn't just dislike  
mowing his lawn -- he hates it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll have the kids do it, the neighbors, my wife, I don't  
care,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not quite time for him to sell off his mower, but an  
emerging group of chemicals could someday take most of the mowing 
out of his yard work. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, golf course superintendents and sports field managers  
have used plant growth regulators to keep their greens trim. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea hasn't yet caught on with homeowners, in part because  
the products are hard to apply and have had a reputation for doing 
more damage than good if improperly used. 
</P>
<P>
	But newer, more foolproof versions of the products are entering  
the professional market, leading some to believe homeowners also 
could eventually buy something that would give them a thick, green, 
no-mow lawn. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a sure market like fertilizer,'' said Ken Diesburg,  
who studies turf grasses at Southern Illinois University in 
Carbondale. ``But at least one of the lawn-care companies is 
thinking about using it, which is a first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diesburg has been studying the active ingredient in a newly  
released professional product from Rhone Poulenc Ag Co., called 
Proxy. 
</P>
<P>
	He has found that the newest generation of growth regulators has  
more tolerance for mistakes and does less damage if improperly 
used. 
</P>
<P>
	Growth regulators, which began appearing in the 1980s, slow or  
stop grass growth by shifting the plants' hormonal balance, 
Diesburg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Proxy works by shifting the plant's growing energy from up to  
out. Instead of taller shoots, grass plants produce branches, 
making a thick turf that might need mowing just twice a summer, 
Diesburg said. 
</P>
<P>
	It works best on Kentucky bluegrass, the most popular grass for  
golf course fairways in much of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	However, current products require precise application. Although  
Proxy is more forgiving when people overlap areas when spraying it, 
it is still not easy to apply, Diesburg said. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Scotts Co., an Ohio-based manufacturer of lawn-care  
products, found additional factors standing in the way when it 
tried unsuccessfully to market its PGR growth regulator to 
consumers several years ago, said Scotts grass expert Ashton 
Ritchie. 
</P>

	``A lot of them enjoy taking care of the lawn, how it smells  
after they mow it, how it looks after they mow it. And people who 
don't mow don't tend to buy lawn care products, either,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, a growth regulator would be appealing to homeowners if  
manufacturers can overcome the technical hurdles, said Alan Marcus, 
director of the Iowa State University Center for Historical Studies 
of Technology and Science. 
</P>
<P>
	``People for whatever reason think they have too much to do and  
too little time to do it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Santiago Wins Cuba's Baseball Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- A week later, it was no contest at Estadio  
Latinoamericano. 
</P>
<P>
	Back at the same ballpark where the Baltimore Orioles barely  
beat a Cuban all-star team, the deciding Game 7 of the Cuban 
national baseball series Sunday was a rout: Santiago 9, Havana 
Industriales 0. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the third time that Santiago won the championship, and  
first since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Santiago forced a Game 7 with a win Saturday, then surprised  
tens of thousands of fans who turned out to cheer the hometown 
Industriales. 
</P>
<P>
	Gabriel Pierre hit a home run in the second inning and the team  
from eastern Cuba never let up. Adrian Hernandez, who recently won 
five key games for Havana, started but appeared weak. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Sunday, the Orioles held off the Cubans 3-2 in 11 innings.  
That Cuban team did not include any of the Havana or Santiago 
players -- they may play May 3 when an all-star team plays the 
Orioles at Baltimore's Camden Yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Santiago was tough all weekend despite missing four of its  
players. Fausto Alvarez, Jorge Tissert and Rey Isaac had to sit out 
because of injuries, and Pedro Poll was expelled during the final 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	Havana won the first two games of the series, putting itself in  
position for a ninth title. A week ago Saturday, the Industriales 
rallied for three runs in the bottom of the ninth, with a disputed 
call prompting more than a dozen Santiago players to surround the 
umpires -- one player even threw his glove into the face of an 
umpire. 
</P>
<P>
	Isla de la Juventud, from the island's southwestern coast, came  
in third in the series. Guantanamo, from Cuba's easternmost 
province, was fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Humberto Rodriguez, president of the Sports Institute of Cuba,  
told the national news service Prensa Latina that the series had 
been ``a great victory for revolutionary baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year's competition was so good, he said, that it had  
revived interest in the game and helped fill the stadiums again 
after a few years of dwindling attendance.

<HEADLINE> Clemens To Make N.Y. Yankees Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- This may be baseball's strongest fashion  
statement all season: Roger Clemens in Yankees threads. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, the five-time Cy Young Award winner, unveils his new  
look Monday night when the World Series champion New York Yankees 
open their season at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will be very special -- especially since I'm with a  
new club and a new bunch of guys who are going to be behind me. 
I'll have to channel my emotions early and make them work for me,'' 
Clemens said. ``I'm not nervous, but I get excited about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, who won his last 15 games in 1998 en route to his  
unanimous selection as Cy Young Award winner for the Toronto Blue 
Jays, was traded to the Yankees in mid-February for pitchers David 
Wells and Graeme Lloyd and second baseman Homer Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something when you're facing the best team in baseball  
and the best pitcher in baseball over the last 10 years,'' A's 
designated hitter Matt Stairs said. ``There will be a lot of 
adrenaline, we'll just be trying to keep our emotions down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because he'll be wearing the Yankees' road grays, he won't start  
in the famed pinstripes until Saturday against Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees interim manager Don Zimmer, taking over while Joe Torre  
recovers from prostate cancer surgery, said he doesn't expect 
Clemens to be affected by the attention he'll receive in his first 
start for the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a five-time Cy Young winner, so it's just another day at  
work for him. And that's the way he works every day, anyhow,'' 
Zimmer said. ``You go in the clubhouse and you've got to look in 
nine places to find him. But wherever he's at, he'll be working and 
doing something. There aren't too many pitchers who can keep up 
with the conditioning that Roger Clemens goes through every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens' counterpart will be Gil Heredia, who has a 22-24 career  
record and became the A's opening day starter only because staff 
ace Kenny Rogers is recovering from a stiff elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	Heredia, who pitched 7 2-3 scoreless innings in a win over the  
Yankees in New York last September, said he's trying to ignore the 
comparisons with Clemens -- who has 233 career victories. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really haven't even thought about Rogers Clemens vs.  
Heredia. I can't even put them in perspective,'' the A's 
right-hander said. ``I'm just taking it as far as me against the 
Yankees. Roger has nothing to do with my performance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees are coming off a tumultuous spring that included the  
Clemens trade, Torre's diagnosis with prostate cancer and Darryl 
Strawberry's battle to come back from cancer surgery late last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Another twist was added to that in recent days when owner George  
Steinbrenner called Hideki Irabu a ``fat ... toad'' and decided to 
leave the pitcher behind when the team broke training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	But after Zimmer penciled in Ramiro Mendoza instead of Irabu for  
the start Wednesday at Oakland in the Yankees' third game of the 
season, Steinbrenner announced he was hoping Irabu would start that 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the manager, I try to do what's right for the ballclub. My  
mind is not going to be changed by anybody,'' Zimmer replied 
Saturday night in Los Angeles. ``George Steinbrenner has been good 
to me, but, to me, you can't sit back here and be a little wimp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irabu rejoined the Yankees on Sunday and apologized for his  
absence. Zimmer, meanwhile, reiterated that Mendoza would start 
Wednesday and that Irabu would be in the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked to the boss (Steinbrenner) this morning, and he said  
he didn't mandate that anyone start,'' general manager Brian 
Cashman said. ``This isn't as big as it's been made. There was 
certainly a bump in the road the last few days, there's no 
question. We've dealt with bigger things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It has been a much quieter spring for the Athletics, who  
finished last in the AL West the past two seasons and likely will 
end up there again this year. They look forward to starting their 
season against a team that won a record 125 games last season and 
added a future Hall of Famer as its No. 1 starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know they're the best team in baseball, and we can find out  
where we measure up real quickly,'' A's manager Art Howe said.

<HEADLINE> Mir Gets Shipment of Food, Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- A cargo ship docked smoothly with Russia's Mir  
space station on Sunday, bringing with it 5,364 pounds of food, 
water, fuel and equipment for scientific experiments, Russian news 
agencies reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The Progress cargo ship had blasted off from the Baikonur  
cosmodrome in Kazakstan on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mir's current crew of two Russians and a Frenchman is  
possibly its last. If outside investors cannot be found to foot the 
13-year-old station's $250 million yearly costs, the cash-strapped 
government will discard it in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's space chief has said private investors have come  
forward, but the United States still wants the government to 
dedicate its attention to the International Space Station. The 
16-nation project has been delayed by Russia's inability to build 
key components on time.

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Cheap Trick is headed for the Internet.  
</P>
<P>
	The band plans to release a live album April 20 -- but ``Music  
for Hangovers'' will be available via Amazon.com for two months 
before it goes to stores. 
</P>
<P>
	The new album will include live tracks with Smashing Pumpkins'  
musician Billy Corgan and D'Arcy Wretzky-Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	It comes 20 years after the Midwest band's live ``At Budokan''  
album spun off hits ``Surrender'' and ``Auf Wiedersehen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cheap Trick said Sunday it wants to avoid becoming a revival  
act, and plans to tour with younger audiences in mind. The group 
will issue ``Music for Hangovers'' on its own label.

<HEADLINE> Cleveland Indians Sign Langston </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Mark Langston's retirement was short-lived.  
</P>
<P>
	Langston, who announced his retirement last week after 15  
seasons, signed a minor-league contract with the Cleveland Indians 
on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Langston, 38, was a non-roster player with San Diego during  
spring training before leaving camp last week. He decided to give 
it another shot with the Indians, who have just two left-handers on 
their roster. 
</P>
<P>
	Langston will pitch in a simulated game for Cleveland on Monday  
in Anaheim, Calif., then will join the Indians' extended training 
program in Winter Haven, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Langston pitched in his only World Series last October, allowing  
Tino Martinez's momentum-swinging grand slam as the New York 
Yankees won Game 1, 9-6 at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	With the score tied at 5-5 and two outs in the seventh, Langston  
threw a 2-2, two-out pitch that umpire Rich Garcia ruled a ball, 
angering the Padres. Martinez homered on the next pitch. Langston 
also walked two that inning. 
</P>
<P>
	For his career, Langston is 178-156 with a 3.88 ERA pitching for  
Seattle, Montreal, the Angels and San Diego. He was 4-6 last year 
with a 5.86 ERA for the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	His 2,421 strikeouts rank him 27th on the career list. Among  
active pitchers he is second only to Roger Clemens (3,153).

<HEADLINE> Dodgers Make Moves, Keep Brumfield </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Dodgers got down to the  
25-man opening-day roster limit by making eight moves, including 
optioning outfielder Trenidad Hubbard to Triple-A Albuquerque of 
the Pacific Coast League. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't see this coming,'' said Hubbard, who hit .298 in 94  
games with the Dodgers last season. ``It's their team, whatever 
they want. I respect their decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers also optioned left-hander Jeff Kubenka to  
Albuquerque; designated left-hander Greg Cadaret and right-hander 
Arnold Gooch for assignment; placed right-hander Steve Montgomery 
on the 60-day disabled list, and purchased the contracts of 
outfielder Jacob Brumfield, catcher Rick Wilkins and left-handed 
pitcher Pedro Borbon, all of whom had signed minor league contracts 
previously. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves mean the Dodgers will have three catchers on their  
roster as the season begins -- starter Todd Hundley along with 
Wilkins and Paul LoDuca. 
</P>
<P>
	Hampered by soreness in his right elbow, where he had  
reconstructive surgery in 1997, Hundley played in only eight 
exhibition games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think his legs are still not quite there yet,'' Dodgers  
manager Davey Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the three catchers, the Dodgers will start the  
season with 11 pitchers, seven infielders and only four 
outfielders. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest surprise of those making the team was 21-year-old  
left-handed reliever Onan Masaoka, who has never played in 
Triple-A, much less the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	Masaoka pitched in nine games this spring and allowed just one  
earned run in 13 innings.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Refugees Tell of Atrocities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROZAJE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Leading his family to safety across  
the mountains after being thrown out of his house, Cerim Tafalaj 
turned and took a final look back at his homeland, Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	It was in flames.  
</P>
<P>
	Tafalaj, 61, said he fled on foot to Montenegro after gunmen  
came to his door and told him, ``'Go now or you won't wake up 
tomorrow. We will stab you while you sleep.''' They weren't the 
police or the army. They were his neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	Tafalaj related his last view of Kosovo on Saturday, hours after  
joining thousands of ethnic Albanians -- 32,000 here in Montenegro, 
the smaller of the two republics that make up Yugoslavia -- who have 
poured across the borders to escape the terror. 
</P>
<P>
	An overnight snowstorm slowed the exodus into Montenegro, which  
is roughly the size of Connecticut, leaving an icy mountain road 
with 7-foot-high snowbanks almost impassable. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the conditions, carloads of frightened ethnic Albanians  
continued to make their way into Rozaje (pronounced RO-zhai-eh), a 
town already so strained under the burden of 12,000 new refugees 
that huge bread lines form outside bakeries before dawn. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds each are packed into mosques, the bus station and an  
abandoned glass factory where babies' cries resound across damp 
concrete floors and entire families shiver under blankets in a 
production hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Their accounts are impossible to corroborate, but like thousands  
before them they told of being ordered at gunpoint to leave their 
homes and of witnessing killing, looting and burning of houses. 
Shock and fear, rather than anger, were etched in their faces. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ran away in order not to be killed,'' said Faton Zekaj, 20,  
standing near a portrait of Tito, the father of modern-day 
Yugoslavia, once meant to inspire factory workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovars, many of whom walked here from the besieged city of Pec  
about 25 miles south, also made chilling claims about the 
identities of the thugs emptying out Kosovo's towns and cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Tafalaj, 28-year-old Shqipe Husaj was among several  
refugees from western Kosovo who said they recognized their 
assailants. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are all our neighbors, Serb boys of 15 and 16, wearing  
police uniforms,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	After burning nearby shops, she said, they attacked her family's  
home with stones and gunfire. ``They told us to leave the house. 
They said ```Get out and go. We don't want to see you any more.''' 
</P>
<P>
	As her family fled last week, Serb paramilitary separated the  
men from the women and demanded as much as $1,200 from the men to 
let them go, she said. One man said he had only $30, drawing 
obscenities from the armed group. 
</P>
<P>
	``They shot him dead right in front of his family,'' said Husaj,  
her voice shaking. ``I saw him collapse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The journey itself is taking a toll.  
</P>
<P>
	Four babies traveling in a large group on Wednesday died of  
exposure, according to Mevljuda Shalja. The 39-year-old woman, now 
housed in a cramped mosque with 300 others, said she made the long 
walk in her slippers because she barely had time to round up her 
five children after gunmen told them, ``If you don't go in five 
minutes we'll kill you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aisa Gutic, 75, covered the distance on foot Friday despite her  
age. She looked pale and unwell Saturday, still shocked from 
watching the destruction of her home and the once-thriving city of 
Pec. It is now virtually empty, she said, most of its houses 
burning or bombed out with no water and virtually no food 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet many cling to a seemingly irrational dream to return.  
</P>
<P>
	``I will go back when it's free,'' said Osman Fekaj, 70, whose  
extended family of dozens occupies one entire room in the cold 
factory, which has no electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	``For now it's not safe. Serbs are using bombs, grenades. God  
knows how many of them there are. They were everywhere,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others only shrug when asked where they will go next. Survival  
is the main concern -- those who arrived without money have been 
given only a single piece of bread to eat in the last three days. 
</P>
<P>
	With international aid groups mostly still scrambling to arrive  
to meet the overwhelming needs, the high numbers of refugees 
pouring into Montenegro threaten to create both a humanitarian and 
a political crisis in the republic of 650,000, which Western 
officials warn is being targeted by Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic for a military coup. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel bad for them. It's a tragedy,'' said Selma Fetahovic,  
a 25-year-old English teacher who wept when she saw the refugees' 
abysmal condition at the glass factory. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it is creating tremendous pressure on us,'' she said. ``We  
can't take any more.''

<HEADLINE> Photographer Heads Into Full Career </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORTHFIELD, N.J. (AP) -- Alan Dumoff has heard the nicknames.  
Master of Disaster. Dr. Death. Ambulance Chaser. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, he was there when a freak accident propelled a motorcyclist  
10 feet into a roadside tree. He photographed the victim. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, he snapped away after a Dodge Neon collided with a truck,  
the doomed driver screaming, ``Someone help me!'' 
</P>
<P>
	And yes, he showed up when a car plowed into an insurance  
company office, his Nikon purring as paramedics strapped victims to 
stretchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Why not? You never know who might be willing to pay for the  
pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	Monitoring frequencies for police, fire and emergency medical  
service, the veteran freelance photographer hears dispatches and 
rushes in, sometimes beating the ambulances and fire trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	He sells photographs to newspapers, TV stations, personal injury  
lawyers, insurance adjusters, accident investigators. The more 
serious the accident, the more valuable the photos. 
</P>
<P>
	But he doesn't root for death or mayhem.  
</P>
<P>
	``Is it a pretty scene to see a 5-year-old get mangled in a car  
wreck? To see someone get burned alive in their car? No. But 
there's a reason things have to be documented,'' he says. ``Not 
every job has a pretty side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dumoff cruises U.S. 40 near Atlantic City, awaiting his next  
call. His office is a red 1990 Toyota Land Cruiser, 307,489 miles 
on the odometer, four scanners on the dashboard. He doesn't seem to 
be listening until this crackle: ``... pedestrian MVA, 500 block of 
St. Louis Avenue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He knows the dispatchers' voices, can tell from the way they  
talk when the accident is unusual or, as perhaps in this ``motor 
vehicle accident,'' unusually severe. ``You start to get a feel for 
when something's out of the ordinary,'' he says, pulling a U-turn. 
</P>
<P>
	Another scanner crackles to life: A car has hit a building on  
U.S. 9. Another U-turn. 
</P>
<P>
	Dumoff learned news photography in his native Philadelphia from  
a former photo editor at the Philadelphia Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
	Too young to drive, he would shoot whatever he could find in the  
neighborhood. At age 18, he was hired by United Press International 
and headed to Vietnam where he quickly learned that a strong 
stomach was as crucial as a good camera. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here were people losing their lives, but it was my job to  
document it,'' he says. ``If it doesn't affect you, you're not 
alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Back in the states, he earned bachelor's and master's degrees in  
photography. Then he turned into an accident addict, producing 
photographs -- sometimes too graphic for mass media -- that would 
help win a personal injury case or prosecute a drunken driver. 
</P>
<P>
	To foster business, he offers his copyrighted photographs free  
to police investigators. Everyone else pays -- a minimum of four 
8-by-10 color prints, $35 each. An acquaintance says Dumoff earns 
more than $100,000 a year. Dumoff demurs, saying only he ``does 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How? ``Getting there as early as possible is a primary thing,''  
he says. ``The first 10 to 15 minutes are the key. That's when all 
the action is taking place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dumoff hops out at the scene where the luxury sedan plowed into  
a one-story office building, coming to rest amid crumbling plaster 
and shards of glass. 
</P>
<P>
	In 15 minutes, Dumoff shoots nearly a roll of film. Then he  
hangs around, chatting up rescue workers, pursuing the name of the 
building's owner. Surely he'll want photographs. Then there's the 
driver, the office manager, the two people inside who suffered 
minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	He gets names from police, squirreling them away for later, when  
he'll send a note on Dumoff Visual Evidence letterhead. ``Dear Sir: 
I photographed the scene of your accident. Sincerely, Alan 
Dumoff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then he waits for the phone to ring. It always does.  
</P>
<P>
	Often, the voice on the other end is that of a lawyer. Lawyers  
call Dumoff ``The Golden Key'' because his photographs can be 
pivotal in a civil suit. And while a picture may be worth a 
thousand words, Dumoff's can be worth far more.	   ``He can freeze in time conditions at the scene that you can 
never duplicate,'' says personal injury attorney Paul D'Amato of 
Atlantic City. He has used Dumoff photographs for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	At home, Dumoff monitors 22 scanners around the clock, and he's  
always ready to go. Clothes are laid out, ready to wear. His shoes 
have Velcro tabs. Laces would take too long to tie. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no such thing as time, weather, space or anything that  
deters ... . I can be out the door from a dead sleep in four 
minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The noise of his scanners drives his wife nuts. ``I turn them  
off,'' says Joan Bell, ``and he turns them on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dumoff does take time off, occasionally. The couple prefers  
cruise vacations for a complete getaway. Even then he carries a 
camera, for tropical sunsets.

	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Allen Iverson Crisis, Day 3, unfolded  
Sunday with the Philadelphia 76ers star expected to rejoin the team 
when his bruised and strained thigh is 100 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Larry Brown told The Associated Press in a telephone  
interview from Toronto that Iverson said he was too injured to go 
back into a game against Cleveland Friday night after the two 
exchanged words on the sideline. Brown said both agreed that 
Iverson would skip the team's brief road trip and get treatment on 
his leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, whose relationship with Iverson has been rocky from the  
start, wants the latest feud between them to be over. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a battle between me and him,'' Brown said as the  
Sixers prepared to face the Raptors without Iverson, the NBA's 
leading scorer. ``This is over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson, who had played for two weeks with a deeply bruised  
thigh, did not play the opening 2:03 of the second quarter against 
the Cavaliers Friday night after going 0-for-7 in the first 
quarter. Brown generally rests Iverson at the end of the first or 
beginning of the second quarter to buy him a few extra minutes with 
the break between periods. 
</P>
<P>
	When Brown told Iverson to go back into the game, Iverson  
muttered something that reporters sitting near the Sixers' bench 
reported as, ``It's about ... time you put me back in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``So I sat him back down,'' Brown said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Sixers, slipping out of contention for the final playoff  
spot in the Eastern Conference becasuse of a rash of injuries and 
spotty play, lost 85-80. Iverson sat out the final three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said it was Iverson's decision not to return to the game  
after the spat. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he couldn't go and that was it,'' Brown said. ``I'm  
not going to question any player on my team when he tells me he's 
injured.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson was in Philadelphia getting treatment, and attempts by  
the Sixers to reach him for comment were unsuccessful. He severely 
bruised his right thigh in a collision with the Los Angeles Lakers' 
Shaquille O'Neal March 19, but tried to keep playing. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said Iverson told him Saturday he was too hurt to play,  
and the two agreed he should stay home and get treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to rehab and come back when it's 100 percent,''  
Brown said. ``I'm not going to worry about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the game against Cleveland, Iverson said he was not going  
to play at Toronto Sunday and was doubtful for Tuesday's home game 
against Milwaukee. He tried to downplay his latest quarrel with 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	``There ain't no problems,'' Iverson said. ``Everything ain't  
going to be peaches and cream all the time. But I don't have any 
problems with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said Iverson objects every time the coach takes him out of  
a game, so he didn't see why this time became such a controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only big difference is, people heard his response when I  
put him in,'' Brown said. ``The biggest disappointment is, it was a 
big game, a game we really needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do I like getting yelled at every game? Absolutely not. But  
that's him. I understand that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown is not considering disciplinary action.  
</P>
<P>
	``My thing is, let's get over it,'' Brown said. ``What good is  
it going to do? How is it going to change anything unless it makes 
it worse?'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the latest in a series of flaps between Iverson and  
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the two publicly criticized each other to the point  
that Iverson vowed to ``remember everything come contract time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After signing a six-year, $70.9 million contract extension in  
January, Iverson said he and Brown had put their differences behind 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just had to mature,'' Iverson said. ``I realized that he was  
a great coach when I looked at his resume. It was important for me 
to put my pride aside and listen to what was said to me as a 
positive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just young, I had to do a lot of growing up.''  
</P>
<P>
	Then, Iverson had an unexcused absence from practice March 11.  
Forcing Iverson to be accountable to his teammates, Brown had the 
team decide how to handle it. Brown followed the players' 
recommendation not to suspend Iverson, but the 23-year-old guard 
was warned that further transgressions would be punished. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said Iverson would be at practice Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's not even an issue,'' he said. ``He's still part of the  
team.''

<HEADLINE> At Least Six Killed in La. Twister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BENTON, La. (AP) -- Authorities searched through wreckage for  
additional victims on Easter morning after a tornado flattened 
homes and killed at least six people. 
</P>
<P>
	The twister swept through mobile home parks Saturday afternoon  
in the community just north of Shreveport. It was 300 yards wide 
when it passed through north Shreveport on its way to Benton, the 
National Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 30 homes were destroyed in the Twin Point Trailer Park,  
state police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bossier Parish County Sheriff Larry Deen confirmed Sunday  
morning that six people were killed -- a 14-year-old girl and five 
adults. State police earlier had reported nine deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Deen said 100 people were treated at hospitals and released.  
</P>
<P>
	Deputy coroner Lisa Hayes said rescuers were still digging  
through debris and the death count could rise. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a major disaster ... so after we finish, who knows?''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Hay Meadow Trailer Park, twisted trees and overturned  
cars were mixed with the wreckage of homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't even tell it was a trailer park,'' said Johnny  
Johnson, manager of the Silver Dollar Bingo, a concrete block 
building next to the trailer park. ``It looks like a trash heap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About the same time, a separate tornado destroyed the First  
United Methodist Church in Logansport, a DeSoto Parish town 
southwest of Shreveport near the Texas border.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Or Beisbol, Game Is Same </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTERREY, Mexico (AP) -- The headline on the front page of  
Monterrey's biggest newspaper said it all -- ``Playball!'' 
</P>
<P>
	They may be saying it in Japan on opening day 2000, or maybe in  
Venezuela or Puerto Rico in the not-too-distant future. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball is beisbol, no matter the language or where it's  
played. Major league officials hope they've started a trend with 
Sunday night's historic international opener between the Colorado 
Rockies and San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it just sets out the opening game,'' said Paul  
Beeston, baseball's No. 2 official. ``The opening game of baseball 
means something, and to take it international, I think it makes a 
statement for us that we believe in taking the game on a new 
direction. This is fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the landmark Saddle Mountain of the majestic eastern Sierra  
Madre towering in the distance beyond center field at Estadio 
Monterrey, baseball returned to Mexico, if just for one game. 
</P>
<P>
	The first opener outside of the United States and Canada, it was  
to be televised in more than 200 countries. And it was the only big 
league game in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	These two teams were natural. It was a homecoming for Rockies  
third baseman Vinny Castilla, a hero in his native Mexico. And the 
Padres, who started the trend of international ball by playing the 
first-ever series in Mexico in August 1996, want to be known as 
more than just Tijuana's team. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres also moved a regular-season series to Hawaii in 1997.  
The Orioles played a historic exhibition game in Cuba a week ago, 
and many officials say other clubs should follow that lead. And the 
Mets and Expos played two well-received games in the Dominican 
Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan might be next.  
</P>
<P>
	Playing a season-opening series in Japan has been in the  
discussion stage for the last year and a half. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope to bring it to closure in the next month or two, and  
if we can do that, we can open it over there,'' Beeston said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle Mariners, whose majority owner is the Nintendo Corp.  
of Kobe, Japan, have expressed interest in playing in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	While the trailblazing Padres will likely continue to seek out  
exotic locales, it's clear they don't hold a monopoly on the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	``We like to think of ourselves as being in the vanguard, but  
frankly, the vanguard is expanding,'' Padres president Larry 
Lucchino said Sunday. ``There are lots of people in baseball who 
have awakened to the desirability and the inevitability of 
international baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Rockies general manager Bob Gebhard: ``This is a sport that  
needs to expand and involve the entire world, not just the U.S. and 
Canada.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While going to Japan is the next logical step for baseball in  
general, the Padres have a strong bias toward Latin America, 
``given our desire to be Mexico's team,'' Lucchino said. 
</P>
<P>
	That desire was destined to take a back seat Sunday night  
because of Castilla's immense popularity. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Lucchino said reaching out to all of Mexico helps  
the Padres with their identity in Baja California. He said future 
games could be played in Hermosillo, Culiacan or Guadalajara. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres also would love to play games in Venezuela, homeland  
of catcher Carlos Hernandez, and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Beeston said Puerto Rico and Venezuela could currently handle  
big league games. Japan plays host to an annual postseason tour of 
big league all-stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball doesn't have a goal of having an international opener  
every year, Beeston said, ``but we'll certainly have to look at 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This game was a sellout and an adjoining Baseball Festival drew  
thousands of fans, particularly kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's healthy, it's exciting and it's fun,'' Beeston said.  
</P>
<P>
	Padres batting star Tony Gwynn said there were some reservations  
among the players about moving opening day. 
</P>
<P>
	``But once we got on the plane, everybody's looking forward to  
it. This is the first day of the season and there's always that 
excitement about the first game of the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Leyland, making his debut as Rockies manager, agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is obviously a major day in the history of our game,'' he  
said. ``I think this is really a sign of things to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres will play their real home opener Tuesday afternoon,  
also against Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	There are obstacles in international games, like travel and  
cultural differences. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel lost,'' said Gwynn, who doesn't speak Spanish.  
</P>
<P>
	But, he added, ``once the hoopla's over, it's baseball. The  
baseball part of it will always be the same.''

<HEADLINE> Glavine, Schilling Meet in Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Forgotten in the hoopla over the Kevin  
Brown-Randy Johnson matchup is the pitching battle in Monday's 
opener between the Atlanta Braves and Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Glavine vs. Curt Schilling isn't exactly shabby.  
</P>
<P>
	Facing Schilling was Glavine's reward after winning the NL Cy  
Young Award last season. Greg Maddux started five of the previous 
six openers for the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's part of the territory,'' Glavine said. ``You're going to  
face other teams' No. 1 guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling, the subject of trade rumors all winter, was 15-14  
with a 3.25 ERA last season. He led the league with 300 strikeouts 
and 15 complete games as the third-place Phillies went 75-87, 31 
games behind the Braves in the NL East. 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine was 20-6 with a 2.47 ERA as the Braves won their seventh  
straight division title. His only previous opening day assignments 
were in 1990 and '92. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not pitching against Curt Schilling so much as I am  
pitching against his offense,'' Glavine said. ``I have to get those 
guys out and give our guys a chance to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine allowed just one run in his last 15 innings during  
spring training. Schilling made his last spring training start on 
Wednesday, striking out seven in six innings against Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling likes his offense, which includes second-year third  
baseman Scott Rolen, who hit 31 home runs and drove in 110 a year 
ago; Rico Brogna, who hit 20 home runs and drove in 104 runs; and 
newly acquired Ron Gant, who had 26 home runs and 67 RBIs with the 
St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to score more runs. I don't think there's any  
question about that,'' Schilling said. 
</P>
<P>
	He threw 108 pitches against the Reds, and Philadelphia manager  
Terry Francona said Schilling is ready to throw about 120 pitches 
in the opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's very, very strong,'' Francona said.  
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta enters the season with two key losses: first baseman  
Andres Galarraga will miss the season because of a malignant tumor 
in his back, and closer Kerry Ligtenberg needs season-ending elbow 
surgery this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga hit 44 home runs and drove in 121 runs. Ligtenberg had  
30 saves in 34 chances as a rookie after Mark Wohlers had control 
problems that jeopardized his career. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves, however, do have depth. During the offseason,  
Atlanta acquired second baseman Bret Boone from Cincinnati and 
signed free agent outfielders Brian Jordan and Otis Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
	Boone hit .266 with career highs in homers (24) and RBIs (95)  
last season. Nixon, who played with the Braves from 1991-93, 
returns after a year in which he hit a career-high .297 with 37 
steals in 110 games for the Minnesota Twins. Jordan hit .316 with 
25 homers and 91 RBIs last season with St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers had a decent spring and is expected to reclaim his  
closer's job. If not, John Rocker, who pitched 12 shutout innings 
during the spring, could step in. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like our team. I think we're fine,'' Braves manager Bobby  
Cox said. ``Wohlers -- that has to be the one major thing that has 
happened this spring.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Unemployment May Climb Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan, which is already suffering from record-high  
unemployment, may see its jobless rate rise even further to 5.2 
percent, Japan's chief economic planner said Sunday, according to a 
news report. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the government announced that unemployment in Japan  
had jumped 0.2 percent in February to an unprecedented 4.6 percent, 
dampening hopes for an imminent economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Taichi Sakaiya, the head of Japan's Economic Planning  
Agency, said the worst was yet to come in the employment situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a possibility of the rate going as high as 5.2  
percent,'' Sakaiya was quoted as saying by Kyodo News Agency.

<HEADLINE> Football Great Namath Wants Divorce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Hall of Fame quarterback Joe Namath  
has filed for divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	Namath and his 37-year-old wife Tatiana married in 1984 and have  
a home in Jupiter. They have two children, Olivia, 13, and Jessica, 
8. 
</P>
<P>
	According to court records, Tatiana Namath is not contesting the  
divorce, the Sun-Sentinel reported Sunday. Namath's lawyer, James 
Fox Miller, filed the papers in Broward County circuit court March 
19. 
</P>
<P>
	Namath, 55, remains one of the most celebrated football figures,  
even in retirement. During his years with the New York Jets, 
Namath's playboy image as ``Broadway Joe'' shook the staid NFL. But 
for many years now he has reveled in his life as a doting family 
man. 
</P>
<P>
	Namath was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1985  
after a 13-year career, 12 with the Jets and the last one with the 
Los Angeles Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	He is best remembered for his guarantee that the Jets, a 17  
1-2-point underdog, would beat the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl 
III. The Jets won 16-7, a victory that vindicated the upstart AFL.

<HEADLINE> California Releases Confusing Maps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In a land of natural disasters, the state  
released a series of confusing seismic maps showing Beverly Hills 
and other Southern California neighborhoods that may -- or may not -- 
suffer landslides and building collapses during a major earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
	Using words such as ``liquefaction'' and ``soil strength,''  
geologists and seismologists identified 24 at-risk ``quadrangles,'' 
talking points that ended up raising more questions than they 
answered. 
</P>
<P>
	``Does this mean California is going to fall into the ocean?''  
asked one befuddled reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the few declarative sentences uttered during an  
hourlong press conference, a seismic expert answered, ``Absolutely 
not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the second year in a row, California's Department of  
Conservation unveiled color-coded ``seismic hazard zone maps'' 
mandated by the governor after San Francisco's deadly 6.9-magnitude 
Loma Prieta quake in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	They are designed to identify landslide sites and water-logged  
ground areas in danger of destructive movement during a quake with 
a magnitude of 5 or greater. Seismologists estimate the Los Angeles 
basin has about a 10 percent chance of getting such a shake within 
the next 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the landslide zones were no-brainers -- the mushy  
hillsides of Malibu, which slip with great regularity, earthquake 
or no -- the Hollywood Hills and the coastal Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	Liquefaction areas -- where thousands of years of river sediments  
and the presence of sandy soil makes land shifts more likely -- run 
roughly along the Los Angeles River in downtown, in pricey 
neighborhoods including West Hollywood and Sherman Oaks, and in 
areas along the Pacific Ocean like Malibu, Venice and Playa del 
Rey. 
</P>
<P>
	The state encourages municipalities to use its maps to  
strengthen building codes for new developments, mostly in the form 
of soil testing and report writing. But exactly how that process 
works and the effect it might have wasn't explained in plain 
English, either. 
</P>
<P>
	For homeowners, it constitutes one more line to check on the  
Natural Hazard Disclosure Statement required of California property 
sellers. Also on the list: flood, fire and earthquake zones. 
</P>
<P>
	In a state known for calamity, there exists a certain fatalism.  
Property values have not suffered since the state began releasing 
maps, according to a spokesman for the California Association of 
Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
	Try as he might, state geologist Jim Davis, entrenched in years  
of scientific thinking, was unable to provide unambiguous answers 
to questions about what the maps really meant. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is it you want us to tell viewers tonight?'' asked an  
exasperated journalist at the March 25 briefing. 
</P>
<P>
	``These green areas are the equivalent of a medical prescription  
that says there are symptoms here that are worthy of additional 
testing,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Translation: If you live in one of 83 cities mapped in Los  
Angeles and Orange counties, you might want to check the building 
codes in effect when your house was built, and consider 
retrofitting measures such as reinforcing your home's foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	However, in a state virtually inured to fire, floods and  
shaking, the maps made little difference to some right in the 
middle of the most expensive hazard zones. 
</P>
<P>
	Hellen Yellin has lived on South Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills  
for 26 years. Her home survived the 6.7-magnitude Northridge quake 
in 1994 just fine, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not really worried about it. We've retrofitted our  
house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what she would do if the ground opened under her house  
during a major quake, Yellin laughed. ``I don't know. Wear a life 
vest?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shirley Bailey, who lives a few blocks away, couldn't even  
imagine the earth sinking and slipping in her neighborhood. ``That 
has never happened here, and I've been here 35 years,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``So every once in a blue moon, we have an earthquake,'' Bailey  
said. ``It certainly doesn't deter people from coming here.''
