<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary George
Robertson on Tuesday warned Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
that there was "very little time left" to resolve the rapidly
escalating crisis over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"President Milosevic has very little time left now. But he
should in that remaining time listen carefully to the message that
has been given -- pull back, stop the violence and sign up to a
political agreement," Robertson was quoted by Reuters as saying.
</P>
<P>
"If military action has to be taken, then it will be his
responsibility" and all NATO members were united, according to
Robertson, speaking after talks with Greek Defense Minister
Apostolos-Athanassios Tsohatzopoulos.
</P>
<P>
"There is a humanitarian catastrophe looming if the violence
does not stop," Robertson said. "We are absolutely determined that
the violence and misery being inflicted on the ordinary people of
Kosovo must stop."

WASHINGTON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. special envoy Richard
Holbrooke made no breakthrough on Kosovo peace after his talks
with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and will leave
Belgrade in a few hours, the White House said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"There's been no breakthrough in these talks," White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart said.

<P>
Holbrooke has met Milosevic twice in Belgrade, but could not
force the Yugoslav president to agree that NATO troops police
peace in the province of Kosovo.

"I've been informed that unless there is some dramatic change
in President Milosevic's position, that Ambassador Holbrooke

<HEADLINE> Britain Stands Ready to Strike Yugoslavia: Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said on Tuesday that Britain stood ready with its NATO allies to
take military action against Yugoslavia if there is no resolution
to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Britain stands ready with our NATO allies to take military
action," Blair said during a speech in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
There was "little cause to be optimistic" about the outcome of
latest attempts in Belgrade to persuade Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to accept a peace deal, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister said military action would be taken
primarily to avoid what he described as a humanitarian disaster in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
There were more than 250,000 people homeless in Kosovo as a
result of repression by Serb forces, he said.
</P>
<P>
To walk away from the situation now "would destroy NATO's
credibility," he told the parliament.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Presses for Removal of Border Obstacles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LUSAKA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) has called for the removal of immigration
formalities and conditionalities that hinder cross border trade.
</P>
<P>
COMESA Secretary General Erastus Mwencha said immigration
formalities force people engaged in cross border trade to evade
normal border posts and routes.
</P>
<P>
Mwencha was speaking at the first cross-border traders
education seminar held Tuesday in Lusaka, Zambia's capital.
</P>
<P>
In some cases, he said, cross border traders are involved in
collusive fraud with officers manning borders and roadblocks. He
said these practices have robbed governments some revenue.
</P>
<P>
Mwecha also called on governments to recognize the cross
border traders association so as to create transparency in cross
border trade.
</P>
<P>
He said in most countries, cross border traders, despite being
 essential to economic growth, are still viewed as smugglers.
</P>
<P>
Mwencha also disclosed that Zambia's total informal cross
border export to the Democratic Republic of Congo, Tanzania and
Zimbabwe amounted to 28.6 million kwacha (15,000 U.S. dollars)
between September 1997 and 1998 in exports.
</P>
<P>
He further stressed the need for the currencies of member
states to be easily convertible into one another to create a free
trade area.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Meets Italian Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin met
Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema here Tuesday to exchange
views on bilateral ties and international issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the Sino-Italian relationship was good and the
two countries had made great progress in cooperation in every
field.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that mutual respect and benefit were indispensable
for countries to get along with each other. "This is why Sino-
Italian ties have remained good," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said that both sides should strengthen
dialogue and cooperation in bilateral and international matters.
"This not only conforms with the interest of the two peoples, but
is also conducive to China-Europe and Asia-Europe cooperation and
peace and development in the world."
</P>
<P>
D'Alema welcomed Jiang warmly on behalf of himself and the
Italian government. He said that Jiang's visit was another
important event in bilateral relations following Italian President
Oscar Luigi Scalfaro's visit to China last June.
</P>
<P>
The Italian premier said that China had made tremendous
progress during the past 20 years and was playing an ever more
important role in world politics and economics.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that Italy was an important trade partner of China
in Europe. Generally speaking, bilateral economic and trade
cooperation had grown rapidly.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that both countries would continue to
make joint efforts in economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema agreed with Jiang's views on bilateral relations,
saying that Italy was willing to further its relations with China
in politics, trade and economy, technology and science, culture
and other fields.
</P>
<P>
The Italian premier also praised China for its important role
in stabilizing regional and world financial situations.
</P>
<P>
He said that Italy supported China's bid to join the World
Trade Organization and would make active efforts in helping China
enter the world trade body.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the Asian financial crisis, which began in 1997,
adversely affected the world economy and China adopted a highly
responsible attitude by not devaluating its currency, contributing
to stabilizing the Asian and world economies and easing the
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
China was willing to join with other countries to strive for a
stable international financial market and a just and reasonable
international economic order, the Chinese president said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that he hoped Italy would continue with efforts to
push the European Union to show greater flexibility in negotiating
China's bid for WTO membership so that substantial progress would
be made as early as possible to enable China to join the world
trade body.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday morning, Jiang also met with some Italian
businessmen.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Plant 156 Million Trees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's Ministry of
Agriculture announced Tuesday that it has finalized preparations
to plant 156 million tree-seedlings on 78,000 hectares of land
across the country during the coming big rainy season which starts
in June and ends in September.
</P>
<P>
Million Bekele, leader of the forest and wildlife technology
control team under the ministry, told local press that over 62
million birr (about 7.9 million U.S. dollars) is needed to carry
out the transplantation.
</P>
<P>
A total of 95 percent of the rural people in the country depend
on fuel wood as a source of energy, he said, adding that "the
ever-increasing depletion of forests is aggravating the looming
threat of desertification."
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia's forested area, which was 40 percent of the land mass
50 years ago, has been reduced to a mere 2.5 percent in recent
years. To reverse the trend of deforestation, the Ethiopian
government has taken strict control measures on tree-felling. The
new policy envisaged the development of forest over 8,000 hectares
of land annually during the past five years.

MOSCOW, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Russia's interior troops stationed
in the North Caucasus Region have entered a state of alert since
the March 19 bomb blast which killed more than 50 people, Pavel
Maslov, commander of the interior troops announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Troops have begun patrolling the streets, searching for
explosive devices and protecting densely-populated sites,
important facilities, schools and hospitals, Maslov said.

<HEADLINE> Gas Well Fire in India's Western Offshore Spreads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- A fire raging at an offshore
gas well in western India has engulfed more wells and the owner of
the wells has decided to "kill" them, reports reaching here said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A shallow seismic survey in and around the burning area had
been ordered at a cost of 1 million U.S. dollars to help locate
the "hot spot" and identify the location of "relief" well, the
Press Trust of India (PTI) reported from Mumbai.
</P>
<P>
Uncontrolled leakage of gas from a well caught fire on March 12
and at least three more wells on the platform have been engulfed
in the fire.
</P>
<P>
"We have seen three of them burning and may be another one will
also be engulfed," PTI said, quoting Mark Mazella, a senior well
control specialist from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Mazella, who arrived at the scene 10 days ago to help
extinguish the fire, told a press conference in Mumbai that one of
the tasks to be performed involved "killing" of the burning wells
to stop the flow of gas.
</P>
<P>
The cost of the fire control operations since March 12
including expenses on multi-purpose support vehicles, helicopters
and experts fees amounted to 3 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
A survey vessel is expected to reach the area in the first week
of April and it would start generating information a couple of
days subsequently, PTI said.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the fire is likely to take two months to be
extinguished and therefore the loss in terms of gas production is
expected to be sizable.
</P>
<P>
Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, owner of the wells, lost about
1.6 million cubic meters of gas per day, or 3 percent of the total
gas production in offshore western India, about 1,500 kilometers
southwest of here.

<HEADLINE> Holyfield Insists Fight Result against Lewis was Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Evander Holyfield insisted on
Tuesday that heavyweight unification bout between him and Lennox
Lewis was fair.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday's fight ended in a draw but most observers
concluded World Boxing Council champion Lewis had outpointed
Holyfield, the World Boxing Association and International Boxing
Federation title holder.
</P>
<P>
American Holyfield, speaking for the first time since studying
a tape of the fight, said the result had been fair.
</P>
<P>
"I truly believe that people have been deceived, with all the
punch stats, the commentary, what the commentators were saying,"
he told BBC radio.
</P>
<P>
"The fact is that Lennox fought a smart fight, fought a good
fight, but we both in general didn't do enough to declare a bid to
be undisputed champion..."
</P>
<P>
"We have bad days at the office but we have to get over the bad
days...It wasn't a great day for me but I got through that day and
I thank God for that."
</P>
<P>
Particular interest focused on U.S. judge Eugenia Williams,who
scored the fight 115-113 in favour of Holyfield. A New York grand
jury is investigating whether or not the judges took illegal
payments, according to investigative sources.
</P>
<P>
But Holyfield said that even had Williams made errors, it would
have made little difference to the result.
</P>
<P>
"If you look at her scores you can see there's only one round
where she could have been wrong," he said, adding that even then,
Lewis had only dominated it for 15 to 20 seconds.
</P>
<P>
"Even if she was off one round it would have made the(overall
score) 115-114," he said.
</P>
<P>
"When you look at the fight for what it really was, all the
judges had me winning the eighth, ninth, 10th and 11th rounds --
that's four rounds. Everyone had me winning the third. And one had
me winning the fourth.
</P>
<P>
"If you look at the first round, it's not as though he really
won the first round. He did win the second round, but the first
round was questionable."
</P>
<P>
The two boxers will fight again for the undisputed world
heavyweight title in September at a venue yet to be decided.
</P>
<P>
"I look forward to that. I've signed a contract already...and I
hope we go ahead and settle this thing,"Holyfield said, expressing
a preference for Las Vegas over London as the venue for the fight.
</P>
<P>
"But it really doesn't make a difference to me -- I can win
either way," he said.

LONDON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- A man was slightly injured on

"There was an explosion in a street in Castlewellan, in County

Republican Army prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Tensions in Northern Ireland are increasing as the province's

<HEADLINE> British Prime Minister Sets Terms For Kosovo Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said on Tuesday that Yugoslav troops in Kosovo must be brought
down to agreed level for peace to be achieved in that region.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the House of Commons, Blair called on Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to return his soldiers to barracks
and withdraw the heavy weapons from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Curbing Serb oppression in Kosovo is the basic objectives of
NATO forces, the Prime Minister told the parliament members.
</P>
<P>
He alleged that a NATO-led ground force would have to be
deployed in Kosovo to implement peace there.
</P>
<P>
"Britain stands ready with our NATO allies to take military
action," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
His statement comes as NATO continues preparations for possible
air strikes against Yugoslavia following the failure of crisis
talks between U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and the Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke is reported to prepare to leave Belgrade within
hours.
</P>
<P>
"To walk away (from Kosovo) now would destroy NATO's
credibility," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister warned that the potential consequences of
military action were "serious".
</P>
<P>
But he said "the consequences of not acting are more serious."
</P>
<P>
After his Kosovo statement, Blair is due to fly to Berlin for a
three-day EU summit.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the prime minister's official spokesman said there was
no reason why UK forces could not go into action while Blair was
out of the country.

PARIS, March 23 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
said on Tuesday afternoon that a diplomatic solution for Kosovo is
in the process of failing and the Western countries should go
ahead with their plans.
</P>

"We will have to note the failure of a diplomatic solution and

Chirac during a meeting with visiting Estonian President Lennart

"The hours which will come are decisive and represent the last

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says no Breakthrough in Kosovo Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. special envoy Richard
Holbrooke achieved no breakthrough on Kosovo peaces, the White
House said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"There's been no breakthrough in these talks," White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke has met Slobodan Milosevic twice in Belgrade, one on
Monday night and the other on Tuesday morning, but could not force
the Yugoslav president to agree that NATO troops police peace in
the province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton was briefed by his foreign policy
team on the talks between Holbrooke and Milosevic, and then
briefed a group of members of Congress from both parties on the
situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said Holbrooke laid out a "compelling and clear case
for why President Milosevic should change his position, both in
the interest of the Serbs and the Kosovar Albanians and the
region. But I can't tell you this morning that there is a solid
expectation right now that he will change."
</P>
<P>
"On the one hand he laid out the positive case for reaching a
political settlement in Kosovo. On the other hand he laid out
what the other path could be, which is swift and substantial
NATO action," Lockhart added.
</P>
<P>
The United States and its NATO allies have warned Belgrade
through the crisis that failure to comply with NATO's demand
for Western presence in Kosovo will be punished with NATO
military strikes which could begin quickly.

PARIS, March 23 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin

against the Serbs in Kosovo if all diplomatic means have run out.

"If all means to convince the authorities of Belgrade to cease

Jospin said that "The moment is not far" for NATO to show down

</P>
<P>
"Despite the diplomatic efforts, Mr. Milosevic has not shown
any sign of opening and refuses always to adhere to the framework
of the agreement elaborated in Rambouillet," he said.

<HEADLINE> Durable Goods Orders Drop Sharply in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The orders to U.S. factories
for big-ticket durable goods such as aircraft and washing machines
dropped by 5 percent in February, the sharpest decline in more
than seven years, the Commerce Department reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The total orders were down to a seasonally adjusted 191.8
billion U.S. dollars in the worst decrease since December 1991,
when the economy was just starting its eight-year recovery from
the 1990-91 recession.
</P>
<P>
The drop, however, followed significant gains of 3.3 percent in
January and 3.4 percent in December and left orders still above
the November level, the Commerce said.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the world economic slump that began in Asia
nearly two years ago has hurt American manufacturers by slicing
their export sales and forcing them to compete at home against
low-priced imports.
</P>
<P>
The big drop in civilian aircraft orders, from 11.5 billion
dollars in January to 7.9 billion dollars in February, largely --
but not entirely -- explains February's decline in orders for
durable goods, expensive items expected to last at least three
years.
</P>
<P>
Orders excluding the volatile aircraft industry, where the
timing of a handful of orders can distort the trend, fell 3.4
percent in February after a 0.2 percent drop in January.
</P>
<P>
The one bright spot in February -- orders for primary metals
such as steel -- jumped 7.2 percent last month. But every other
category posted declines.
</P>
<P>
Orders plunged 37.9 percent for military goods, 8.5 percent for
electronic and other electric equipment, 9.4 percent for
transportation equipment other than aircraft, 8.5 percent for
electronic and electrical equipment and 0.4 percent for industrial
machinery.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus: Air Strikes Will not Solve Kosovo Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government is
monitoring developments in Kosovo and does not believe that air
strikes will bring about a solution, Cyprus' government spokesman
Costas Serezis said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said Cyprus' Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides is in
constant touch with the country's ambassador to Belgrade, who is
in contact with Cypriot nationals staying in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Serezis said Cypriots would be advised to leave Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Javier Solana, secretary-general of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, Tuesday night directed NATO Supreme Commander
General Wesley Clark to begin military intervention in the Kosovo
crisis with air operations against military targets in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
His decision came after United States Balkans envoy Richard
Holbrooke failed to persuade Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
to accept an ultimatum to avoid NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke asked Milosevic to call back his troops in Kosovo and
sign a peace deal with ethnic Albanians which would allow NATO
forces to station in this Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav government rejected the demand, and instead
proposed for major changes of the peace deal, which would give
autonomy to ethnic Albanians who make up 90 percent of the
population in the province.

<HEADLINE> EU Leaders Differ Over Strikes in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the 15 European Union (
EU) member states were still split on Wednesday over NATO military
action against Yugoslavia although they were poised to issue a
strongly-worded statement in a bid to put utmost and final
pressure on the Yugoslav government to sign the Kosovo peace deal.
</P>
<P>
At the EU summit meeting in Berlin, diplomatic sources
confirmed that at least four countries remained neutral and
certain countries were not in favor of launching military actions
over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The EU statement was meant to be a final appeal to Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to accept the Rambouillet peace
accord, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
But British officials here said they had no expectations that
Milosevic would fall into line.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who is
attending the EU summit, said NATO forces were ready to launch air
strikes against Yugoslavia over Kosovo and the attack would begin
"in the not too distant future".
</P>
<P>
But Blair could not clarify when the strike would begin and how
long it would take. "Now we are left with no other alternative
than to take military action," he said. "We have to see it
through all the way."
</P>
<P>
British government sources also said that there was "a huge
degree of unity" on the NATO course of action.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana on Tuesday authorized NATO
troops to take military action against Yugoslavia. He told
reporters at the Brussels-based NATO headquarters that he made the
authorization because the last-ditch effort by U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke in Belgrade failed.

HONG KONG, March 24 (Xinhua) - Three Hong Kong international
soccer players were jailed for 22 months each on Wednesday over
match-fixing.
</P>
<P>
Kevin Lok Kar-win, 25, Chan Chi-keung, 28, and Wai Kwan-lung,
22, were also each fined 30,000 HK dollars (about 3,870 U.S.

</P>
<P>
They were also deprived of their registered status in Hong Kong
after the Hong Kong Football Association Ltd. (HKFA Ltd.) was
informed that the trio were sentenced to jail. HKFA Ltd. will
discuss the possibility of a life-time ban on the three players
next week.
</P>
<P>
The three men were accused of conspiring with the team's

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Hold More Consultations on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton plans
to hold more consultations with Congress, allied leaders and
Russian President Boris Yeltsin as NATO prepares for air strikes
against Yugoslav targets, White House spokesman David Leavy said
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton would first likely get a briefing from his foreign
policy advisers, Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
"I expect there will be more consultations both on Capitol Hill
and with allied officials," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Kremlin, Yeltsin was expected to speak to Clinton
later on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Defense
Secretary William Cohen had breakfast at the White House with
National Security Adviser Sandy Berger to discuss the Kosovo
crisis, another administration official said.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said earlier on Wednesday
that he saw no change in the position taken by Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and air strikes against Yugoslav military
targets would go ahead.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to continue with the decision made yesterday," he
told ABC's Good Morning America.
</P>
<P>
He said NATO would try to damage the forces of the Serbian Army
and the Special Police to get Milosevic back to the negotiating
table and to agree to a peace accord on Kosovo, under which NATO
troops would enter the Serbian province of Kosovo to police the
accord's implementation.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: NATO Steps in Europe's Powder Keg </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The threat of imminent NATO air
strikes against Yugoslavia is hanging over the European Union
summit in the German capital, Berlin, starting on Wednesday, after
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana on Tuesday authorized the use
of military force to resolve the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
After Solana's announcement, both NATO leaders and the leaders
of European countries repeatedly said that NATO had been "left
with no other alternative than to take military action" and that
the military action could be stopped if Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic would pull back his army from Kosovo and sign a
peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
But it sounds more precise to say that NATO itself has chosen
to take the current "no alternative" position.
</P>
<P>
After the Cold War ended with the collapse of NATO's historical
adversary, the Warsaw Pact Group, NATO was left as the world's
largest military alliance with no enemy.
</P>
<P>
Russia, and even analysts in the West, have cast doubts on the
need for NATO's existence. The military alliance has itself also
begun to seek reasons for its existence and enlargement.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the former Yugoslavia has offered such a
chance and excuse for NATO.
</P>
<P>
For historical reasons, Yugoslavia is a nation composed of
multiple ethnic groups and there exists comprehensive rivalry and
hostilities among the different ethnic communities.
</P>
<P>
The current instability and rivalry in the Serbia's troubled
southern province of Kosovo gave NATO, which used to claim that
its role was to keep stability and security in the Atlantic areas
and Europe, an excuse to have a hand in that region.
</P>
<P>
Adding that Yugoslavia used to be a friend of the former Soviet
Union and currently Russia, NATO's hypothetical enemy, NATO was
eager to poke its nose there to show its strength and squeeze out
Russia's influence.
</P>
<P>
That's the reason why NATO rushed to meddle in the dispute in
Kosovo, a very clearly internal affair of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
From the very beginning, NATO and the West stood on the side of
the Kosovo Albanians. The Kosovo peace plan initiated by the West
requires "substantial autonomy" for Kosovo and says Yugoslavia
should "invite" NATO forces to Kosovo to "monitor the
implementation of peace" -- very harsh elements the Yugoslav
government clearly could not accept in consideration of its
integrity and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Although NATO's aim was to force the Yugoslav government to
bend to its pressure, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, an "
iron-fisted" man as Western media call him, is certainly not easy
to deal with. Even after NATO's repeated military threats and "
final attempts at a diplomatic solution", he refused to sell his
country's sovereignty by signing the peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
So, NATO was now "left with no other alternative than to take
military action".
</P>
<P>
But it will not be easy for NATO to take the military action.
</P>
<P>
As British media have said, the Balkan region is a powder keg
with a short fuse. World War I started there in the early years
of this century. During World War II, Yugoslavia, occupied by
German Nazis, was the most active area in the anti-Nazi guerrilla
wars.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair said on Wednesday that NATO
knew the risks of taking action.
</P>
<P>
It is time now for NATO to decide how deep it wants to be
pulled into that "powder keg".
</P>
<P>
But no matter what kind of action it takes against Yugoslavia,
NATO will have to face the risk of putting itself in a very
dangerous position. As some analysts have pointed out, if not
handled cautiously, Kosovo might turn out to be "Vietnam in Europe
".
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, NATO officials announced that it would probably
launch the first air strikes against Serbia "during the day or
Wednesday evening at the latest."
</P>
<P>
But what would happen after the strike? If Milosevic still
rejects the peace plan, would NATO send ground troops into Kosovo?
What would happen if NATO soldiers died in Kosovo?
</P>
<P>
NATO officials and leaders in European countries will have to
answer these questions.

<P>
BELGRADE, March 24 (Xinhua) - Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov on Wednesday reaffirmed strong support to Serbia and the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in efforts to reach a peaceful
political solution in Kosovo, Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone call to Milosevic, Primakov "expressed Russia's
determined stand against outside threats of force which represent
a great danger with unforeseeable consequences", Tanjug said,
quoting a foreign ministry statement.
</P>
<P>
"President Milosevic has underlined Serbia's and Yugoslavia's
commitment to a peaceful political resolution guaranteeing
equality for all national communities, to working out clear
principles of Kosovo autonomy with respect for the sovereignty and
integrity of Serbia and Yugoslavia," Tanjug said,
</P>
<P>
It said Yugoslavia appreciated the "principled stand and
support" of Primakov and Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who have
strongly opposed NATO action against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Tanjug said Milosevic stressed that Russian support for
Yugoslav efforts to protect its sovereignty under NATO threats had
"great importance for the political process and the legitimate
national and state interests of Serbia and Yugoslavia and for the
future of relations in Europe and the world, particularly for the
future of relations in the region of southeast Europe".
</P>
<P>
"It was agreed that in the current situation (Yugoslavia and
Russia) should continue constant contacts and consultations."

<HEADLINE> India Investigates Alleged U.S. Plane Intrusion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 24 (Xinhua) -- India is to finalize a report
on the alleged intrusion of an American plane into Indian airspace
within a week, Minister of Civil Aviation Ananth Kumar said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to part with piecemeal information. Air traffic
security is an important matter and is being examined closely,"
Kumar told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The statement was in contradiction with reports here Tuesday
which said the U.S.-registered plane was cleared of charge of
taking photographs over "restricted areas" in the country.
</P>
<P>
The cameras in the aircraft were reportedly not capable of
taking pictures at night and not working when found inside the
plane.
</P>
<P>
J. C. A. Cooper, a British pilot, and his female navigator, J.
M. Kondgaj, were detained on charge of spying in Ahmedabad, 915
kilometers southwest of here, on March 17 and have been under
investigation ever since.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said the only mistake made by the crew members
of the twin-engine turboprop private survey plane was that they
did not mention anything about the cameras they had kept in the
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The crew reportedly told their interrogators that they took off
from Calcutta for Karachi on March 16 and landed at Ahmedabad for
refueling.
</P>
<P>
They said the director general of Indian civil aviation had
cleared them when they landed a day earlier in Calcutta, about
1,900 kilometers east of Ahmadabad.
</P>
<P>
They were on their way to Dubai via Karachi when they were
detained at Ahmedabad on charges of over-flying Indian airspace
without permission and for not possessing proper immigration
papers.  Cooper holds a British passport while Kondgaj has an
Australian one.

<HEADLINE> Albania "Prepared for Worst" in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian government is closely
following developments in Kosovo and prepared to take all
necessary measures to deal with the worst-scenario situation,
Prime Minister Pandeli Majko announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The country had deployed a large force on the border with
Kosovo and all government departments had entered a state of war,
Majko said.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian government held two emergency meetings after NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana on Tuesday night authorized NATO
air strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In a televised address following the government's second
emergency meeting, Majko said the country's sovereignty was "holy"
and the government was doing its utmost to work out concrete
measures to deal with the worst scenario in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Albania fears that NATO air strikes could trigger attacks from
Yugoslavia against Albania, since the country backs the ethnic
Albanians in the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Majko said Albania had received assurances of NATO protection
in a letter Wednesday from Solana.
</P>
<P>
Solana said Albania's security was of "direct and material
concern" to NATO. He promised that NATO would seriously deal with
any attack from Yugoslavia against Albania.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Calls for Strengthened Coop with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Deputy President Christon
Tembo expressed his hope here Wednesday that his country will
enhance and expand cooperation with China especially in mining
sector.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Zhang Wule, visiting Chinese director
of State Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration, Tembo
described the relations between the two countries as "very warm",
saying the two sides have enjoyed very long and friendly relations
since Zambia's independence in 1964.
</P>
<P>
Over the past years the ties have been strengthened and the two
sides have had a lot of cooperation programs such as the
1,860-kilometer Tanzanian- Zambian railway built by China over 20
years ago and the Zambia-China Mulungushi Textiles Joint Venture,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation in mining industry is a new one, he said, hoping
that after China starts operation in Chambish mine it bought last
year, the cooperation will be expanded.
</P>
<P>
The deputy president pledged that his country will be ready to
help in China's endeavor in the mine in northern Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Investment from western countries has been the sole foreign
capital in Zambia's mines, he said. China, a developing country,
has put its investment in Zambia's mine development now, he said
</P>
<P>
Zhang told Tembo that China is able to run the mine well and
achieve good economic returns.
</P>
<P>
He called for more cooperations like joint exploration and
production in the mine industry with China providing expertise and
Zambia offering recourses for the benefit of both sides.
</P>
<P>
Zhang and his party also met with Zambian Commerce, Trade and
Industry Minister David Mpamba and Energy Minister Ben Mwila,
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Zhang arrived here Tuesday for a week-long visit.

<HEADLINE> Russia Calls for Resumption of Peace Talks on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov Thursday warned that Russia would withdraw from the arms
embargo against Yugoslavia if NATO carried out its threatened air
strikes resulting from the failed Kosovo peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from a meeting to discuss the latest situation in
Kosovo, Ivanov told reporters that the situation was extremely
tense and the NATO would probably take military action against
Yugoslavia within hours.
</P>
<P>
The negotiation process on the Kosovo issue should be continued
as the issue could only be resolved through political dialogue,
Ivanov said. The sooner the talks resumed, the faster a solution
could be achieved.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's meeting was also attended by Russian Defense
Minister Igor Dmitriyevich Sergeyev and officials from the General
Staff of Russia's armed forces and the Foreign Intelligence
Service.
</P>
<P>
Russia believed that use of force against Yugoslavia would be
counter-productive and NATO could not achieve its aim by launching
military strikes, which would result in deaths of civilians, an
exodus of refugees and a deterioration of the situation, Ivanov
said.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade should acknowledge its responsibility in finding a
solution to the Kosovo issue and sign the political agreement
which was ironed out recently in Paris, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign minister said that it was a compromise to
sign the agreement and the purpose of doing so was to protect the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia while
respecting the rights of the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
A compromise should be made to pave the way for continuing the
peace talks, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov added Moscow would seriously consider the possibility of
unilaterally withdrawing from the arms embargo imposed on
Yugoslavia if the NATO air strikes went ahead.

<TEXT>
<P>
MILAN, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
here Wednesday that the concrete conditions of each country must
be acknowledged when considering the general principles of human
rights.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is visiting Milan, the third leg of his state visit
to Italy, made the remarks at the welcoming ceremony hosted by
Gabriele Albertini, Mayor of Milan.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese President said that while he was Mayor of Shanghai
in 1985, he had to take into account the basic living standards of
the city's 12 million residents. "Since I came to Beijing, I have
had to take into consideration the basic living standards of 1.2
billion Chinese people," he added.
</P>
<P>
"These are the basic rights of the Chinese people," Jiang
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he told many leaders of foreign countries that to
guarantee the basic living standards of the 1.2 billion Chinese
people was not only important to the stability of China, but also
a major contribution to stability the world over.
</P>
<P>
He said that China was making more efforts to enhance
democratic and legal construction, embodied by the recent
amendments to the Constitution at the Second Plenary Session of
the Ninth National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Jiang hoped that what he had said would promote mutual
understanding of the issue.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese President also spoke highly of the friendly
relations between Milan and Shanghai, the largest Chinese city,
saying that China wanted more people from Milan to be involved in
the economic and technological cooperation in Shanghai and other
places in China.
</P>
<P>
Albertini said that Jiang's visit to Milan embodied the
importance that China has attached to Milan, hoping that the
cooperation between Italy and China would be even closer.

<HEADLINE> Last Cambodian Refugees Return From Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The last group of Cambodian
refugees in Thailand returned Wednesday with the help of the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the Cambodian Red
Cross.
</P>
<P>
About 850 refugees, the last of more than 80,000 people who
fled the country after fighting broke out in 1997, returned from
the Huay Cheung camp in Thailand's Surin Province across the
border from O'Smach.
</P>
<P>
Uy Sam Ath, director of disaster management for the Cambodian
Red Cross, told reporters that some of the refugees hope to return
to their native places in Mondulkiri, Ratanakiri and Stung Treng
provinces and some will go to the area around the northern
Cambodian town of Samraong.
</P>
<P>
Three camps were set up in Thailand after the Cambodian
refugees fled there in 1997 because of factional fighting and in
April last year when government troops pushed into rebel-held
territory in northern Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The fighting ended late last year with the surrender of Khmer
Rouge members and the reintegration of the resistance forces loyal
to Prince Norodon Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
Huay Cheung is the last of the three major refugee camps in
Thailand and the other two were closed last week and in early
February respectively.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Eases Rule on Property Ownership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Thai spouses and children of
foreigners can, from now on, own land and properties under
amendments to the 1941 Land Act, the Interior Ministry announced
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Sanan
Kachornprasart approved the amendments by signing an amended
ministerial regulation on Tuesday, according to an Interior
Ministry statement.
</P>
<P>
Under the amendments, a Thai legally married to a foreigner
will be able to buy or receive a transfer of land if the money is
his or her personal property and not jointly acquired by the
couple during marriage.
</P>
<P>
If a foreign spouse, however, does not confirm that the money
is the sole property of the Thai, or says the money is jointly
owned, a minister in charge of the Land Department can veto the
purchase request.
</P>
<P>
The amended provision also applies to a Thai national who is
not legally married to a foreigner.
</P>
<P>
A Thai married to a foreigner, regardless of the legality of
their marriage, can also receive land given as personal and not
jointly owned property.
</P>
<P>
A Thai divorced from a foreigner and a mixed-blood child
holding Thai nationality can also acquire land through legal
transactions, according to the amendments.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Prepares for Imminent Attack on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- With members of his foreign
policy team with him at the White House early Wednesday morning, U.
S. President Bill Clinton was preparing the nation for an imminent
attack on Yugoslav targets.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and allied warships and bombers stood ready on Wednesday
to deliver a "swift and severe" blow to Yugoslavia, starting with
a U.S.-led barrage of sea-and-air-launched cruise missiles that
would target Yugoslav air defenses and open the way to a larger-
scale bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
Clinton called on Tuesday for the nation to support military
action against Yugoslavia, saying U.S. diplomatic efforts had
reached a dead end and it must "take a stand now".
</P>
<P>
"If we don't do it now, we will have to do it later," he said.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana on Tuesday evening gave
NATO's top commander, U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark, the formal go-
ahead.
</P>
<P>
"No alternative is open but to take military action," Solana
said at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Interviewed on Wednesday on ABC's Good Morning America, Solana
said: "Up to now we have not heard of any change in the behavior
of President Slobodan Milosevic.... We are going to continue with
the decision taken yesterday."
</P>
<P>
An opening volley of cruise missiles would be fired from four U.
S. Navy ships and two submarines in the Adriatic, along with one
British submarine, plus U.S. Air Force B-52 bombers flying from a
base in England.
</P>
<P>
Air Force F-117 stealth fighter-bombers based in Italy are also
likely to be involved in first attacks against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
As NATO strikes appeared all but inevitable, Russian Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov registered his opposition by canceling a
scheduled visit to Washington.
</P>
<P>
Attempting to patch up differences with Russia, Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright spoke by telephone for more than half an
hour with her Russian counterpart Igor Ivanov, according to State
Department spokesman James Rubin.
</P>
<P>
Albright told Ivanov that she hoped the United States and
Russia could find a way "to deal with the situation and continue
to work in other ways".
</P>
<P>
She also conferred twice by telephone with Solana and talked
separately with the foreign ministers of France, Britain and
Germany.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Rules Out Participation in Military Action Against Serbia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria will not join military
action against Yugoslavia and was facing no threats, President
Peter Stoyanov said on National Radio Wednesday morning after NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana authorized the start of military
action.
</P>
<P>
"Bulgaria's position on the conflict in Kosovo remains
unchanged: this country will not join military action, if any,
against neighboring Yugoslavia," Stoyanov said.
</P>
<P>
"Bulgarian soldiers will not be committed to military operation,
and I want this to be absolutely clear. Bulgarian mothers have
absolutely no reason to worry in this respect."
</P>
<P>
The president said he had no plans to convene the Consultative
Council on National Security. "Nothing has changed since my
statement late last night," he said, adding that he was closely
following developments and the council would be immediately
convened if necessary. This, however, should not create needless
tension in his opinion.
</P>
<P>
Stoyanov also indicated that he would not cancel his trip to
the Germany city of Leipzig for the opening of a book fair. "If I
don't go, this might be seen as an indication of anxiety and
tension," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in parliament on Wednesday, the leader of the
opposition Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) strongly opposed any
military action without a U.N. mandate.
</P>
<P>
He proposed convening the Consultative Council for National
Security with the President and a separate extraordinary sitting
of the National Assembly on the crisis in Kosovo to hear Prime
Minister Ivan Kostov.
</P>
<P>
"We categorically oppose any military operations unsanctioned
by the UN Security Council," Purvanov said.
</P>
<P>
The Floor Leader of the ruling Union of Democratic Forces
Ekaterina Mihailova called on politicians to treat the situation
calmly and responsibly and not to politicize the matter. "All
institutions in the country are ready to react if necessary," she
said. The Socialists greeted this statement by banging on the
desks in the debating chamber.
</P>
<P>
When the National Assembly Chairman Yordan Sokolov refused to
put to the vote the Socialists' motion for a parliamentary debate
on the Kosovo crisis, the Socialist MPs walked out of the sitting
in protest.

<HEADLINE> UK Law Lords Rule No Immunity for Pinochet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Britain's highest court ruled on
Wednesday that former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet is not
immune from prosecution, opening the way for a hearing on his
extradition to Spain.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet's arrest in Britain was lawful, the seven-man panel of
Law Lords announced in the House of Lords, the upper chamber of
the British parliament.
</P>
<P>
The ruling, made by a vote of six to one, said Pinochet enjoyed
no immunity from prosecution for human rights abuses during his
1973 to 1990 rule simply because he was a former head of state.
</P>
<P>
But the Law Lords said he was responsible only to charges of
crimes committed after 1988, the date when Britain incorporated
the United Nations convention on torture into law.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, 83, was arrested in London last October on a warrant
from Spain. A Spanish judge accused him of being responsible for
the deaths and disappearances of 3,000 people and requested his
trial in Spain.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet has been under house arrest in a rented mansion near
London since his detention.
</P>
<P>
Last November, another Law Lords panel decided that he had no
immunity from prosecution and should face extradition proceedings.
But that ruling was set aside because one of the judges was
alleged of having strong links with the human rights body, Amnesty
International.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's decision again paved the way for proceedings to
decide whether Pinochet can be extradited to Spain.
</P>
<P>
Earlier during the day, a Chilean air force plane landed at an
air base near London, ready to take Pinochet back home in case the
Law Lords ruled in favor of the retired general.

<HEADLINE> 7th Letter to Help Thailand Spur Economy: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Finance Minister
Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda said here Wednesday that the country's
seventh letter of intent to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
will help jump start the economy next month.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on the letter, which was passed by the
cabinet Tuesday, Tarrin said it will serve as the government's
economic policy framework through June, when the next review of
economic performance is scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Under the seventh letter to the IMF, the government would be
allowed to run a 6-percent budget deficit of the country's gross
domestic product (GDP) to eventually achieve the targeted
1-percent real economic growth rate this year.
</P>
<P>
The government will also try to achieve a low-level 2.5-percent
inflation and maintain 32 billion to 34 billion U.S. dollars in
foreign reserves.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin said most of the approved deficit would be financed by
foreign loans, including those from Japan's Miyazawa Plan and the
Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund, the Manila-based Asian
Development Bank and the World Bank. The rest of about 1 percent
would come from new government spending programs and tax cuts
included in the new economic stimulus package.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government is expected to announce the new economic
stimulus package on March 30, focusing on job creation programs
and boosting of the social safety net.
</P>
<P>
It would also direct progress toward legal and structural
reforms, namely strengthening the bankruptcy and foreclosure
systems and liberalizing investment in key sectors, the finance
minister said.
</P>
<P>
The seventh letter of intent is expected to be approved by the
IMF Executive Board on April 7 before a new IMF standby credit of
490 million dollars is released to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
So far, Thailand has received 12.46 billion dollars in
financial assistance from the IMF-initiated 17.2 billion dollar
rescue package since the economic crisis broke out in mid-1997.

</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Initial NATO bombings of Serbia will be broader and more
punishing than originally envisioned, going after 60 targets
instead of delivering short, sharp strikes, European and American
officials said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
-- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, en route to
Washington for seeking financial aid, ordered his pilot to turn
his airliner around and return to Moscow after received a
telephone call from U.S. Vice President Al Gore who informed
Primakov the United States and NATO were preparing to launch
airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- The oil ministers from the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries signed on Tuesday a widely anticipated pact to
cut global oil output to put up oil prices.

between protectionism and free trade as it confronts increased
imports of foreign steel, signaled support for a move in Congress
to bolster enforcement of U.S. trade laws.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Company Donates Artificial Legs to Disabled Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- A disabled man with only one leg
has been given the chance of re-starting his life thanks to a Sino-
Canadian medicare program which provides artificial limbs free of
charge.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Zhongyin, a 29-year-old man living in a poor village in
southwest China's Yunnan Province, lost his left leg in an
accident in August last year and has been dependent on his family
every since.
</P>
<P>
Now, he said, with the new "leg" he can even return to his work
as a farmer.
</P>
<P>
The Carolwood Corporation Canaola of Canada first started its
program of providing free limbs to Chinese people in 1997 and so
far 105 people have benefited. There are some 9 million people
disabled in such a way in China and 700,000 of them need
operations or false limbs.
</P>
<P>
And in a month's time a further 199 disabled people like Zhang
will receive the same kind of help in the province.
</P>
<P>
The program has funding of 400,000 yuan from the Carolwood Corp.
and 200,000 yuan from the local government and was inaugurated on
March 18. Since then 16 people have received artificial limbs.
</P>
<P>
They are all part of the lower leg, which are cheap and
technically simple to make, compared with other artificial limbs,
according to experts. Each artificial leg costs about 400 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Melissa Bailey, an official of the Canadian company, said that
the company will continue its efforts to cooperate with China in
setting up training centers in underdeveloped inland provinces of
Guizhou and Gansu next year to train local technicians in fitting
and looking after artificial limbs.
</P>
<P>
Xu Xiaoming, an official of the China Disabled Persons'
Federation, said that China is speeding up the work to establish
artificial limb centers in every province.

KATHMANDU, March 24 (Xinhua) -- In an attempt to force the
pilots of the national flag carrier to end their 10-day strike,
the Nepalese government Wednesday banned strikes in the sectors of
communication, transportation and defense, Radio Nepal said.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet made the decision in accordance with related acts
and in view of the upcoming general elections, it said.
</P>
<P>
The pilots of the Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation have been
grounding all the domestic and international flights for the past
10 days because the management has not fulfilled their demand for
cancellation of an agreement to lease Boeing 757 plane from the
China Southwest Airlines.
</P>
<P>
They have called for lease-purchasing another aircraft. The
management, however, does not agree.
</P>
<P>
The strike has come under criticism from the private sector and
the tourism sector in the country.
</P>
<P>
The election to the House of Representatives is scheduled for
May 3 and May 17.

<HEADLINE> Jiang's Visit Hailed by Italian News Media </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MILAN, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Italian news media have fully
covered Chinese President Jiang Zemin's ongoing state visit to
Italy and hailed it as an "event of historic significance in the
bilateral relationship".
</P>
<P>
A front page editorial of the local Chinese-language newspaper,
Xinhua Times, said that the Italian president, government and
parties at large have attached great importance to the visit,
which was also welcomed by people from the economic and trade,
scientific and technological, cultural and educational and the
news sectors, particularly by Chinese people residing in Italy.
</P>
<P>
The editorial, entitled "Historic Visit Geared Toward the New
Century", pointed out that a tendency towards multi-polarization
was developing throughout the world. It said that strengthening
contact and cooperation between China and Italy complied with the
fundamental interests of the two peoples, which would be
beneficial to international peace, stability and development.
</P>
<P>
A front page article in an influential national newspaper,
Republica, predicted the second day after Jiang's arrival that his
three-nation European visit would "surely" be a success, as almost
all the leaders of Western countries have successful talks with
Jiang.
</P>
<P>
The article said, "Jiang, who is cordial, natural and humorous,
is the symbol and front runner of the new generation of the
Chinese leadership".
</P>
<P>
It explained that the reason China had won respect from the
rest of the world in the past year and a half was that it had kept
stable the value of its currency during the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time the Chinese government had to face a
severe international crisis, together with major Western countries
with the spirit of cooperation and "partnership", it said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper commented that it was "not an easily made
decision for Chinese leaders, and China has paid big price for it".
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Jiang's talks with his Italian counterpart Oscar
Luigi Scalfaro, the national newspaper, Stampa, noted in an
article Tuesday that taking Italy as the first leg of his three-
nation European tour fully demonstrated that China paid great
attention to the development of its relationship with Italy.
</P>
<P>
Another national newspaper, Corriere della Sera, said Wednesday
in a report on Jiang's meeting with Italian Prime Minister Massimo
D'Alema that China's determination to enter into the world
economic system deserved applause.
</P>
<P>
The national newspaper, il Giornale, said on the same day that
Italy was very willing to develop relations with China, and as a
member of the European Union and G7, it would make active efforts
to accelerate the process.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper pointed out that Jiang's visit, especially his
extensive contact with Italian entrepreneurs, would provide
possibilities for enterprises in both countries to establish a
more extensive cooperative relationship of mutual benefit,
especially for cooperation between small and medium-sized
enterprises, in which Italy had achieved some success.
</P>
<P>
Almost all of the Italian new media that have covered Jiang's
visit have mentioned the point that China and Italy have shared
common or similar views on such major international issues as the
Kosovo and Iraq crises and the reform of the Security Council of
the United Nations.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 24 (Xinhua) -- A Kenyan passenger train heading
for the country's biggest port Mombasa derailed Wednesday
morning, killing at least 30 people.
</P>
<P>
Police confirmed 30 dead but expected the toll to rise.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said at least 23 foreign tourists were critically
injured, including Americans, Germans and Canadians.
</P>
<P>
The overnight train, which is convenient for tourists
travelling from the capital Nairobi to Mombasa in the south,
derailed near a junction about 300 kilometers southeast of
Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Survivors of the accident said the train suddenly jumped off
the tracks when going at a high speed, flipping one car upside
down and at least four others askew.
</P>
<P>
A Kenyan air force aircraft rescued 23 seriously injured
foreigners to Nairobi's Wilson Airport. Then they were rushed to
major hospitals in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's police, army and National Disaster Committee were
leading the rescue operation with help from the Kenyan Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
The Nairobi-Mombasa train service became more popular after the
El Nino rains destroyed the road in late 1997. Rehabilitation
of the road is still under way.

<HEADLINE> Britain Backs Prodi as EU Executive Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, March 24 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
reaffirmed here Wednesday he favors former Italian Prime Minister
Romano Prodi as the next president of the European Commission, the
executive branch of the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
"What I have always said is that we must have a candidate of
high caliber who is a reformer because Europe needs reform. Mr
Prodi would certainly fit that bill, but let us wait and see what
candidates emerge," said Blair, who is here attending an
extraordinary EU leaders meeting.
</P>
<P>
However, Blair told the BBC that it was not yet clear whether
the two-day Berlin summit would reach a decision on filling the
post.
</P>
<P>
"We will have to wait and see what candidates are available,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The British prime minister also rejected speculations that he
had made a deal with Italy to support Prodi in return for Italy's
support for Britain retaining its three-billion-US-dollar rebate
from the European Union.
</P>
<P>
All of the EU's 14 other members want a change of Britain's
special rebate deal which has been in place since 1984. EU leaders
at the summit are expected to discuss this issue.

<HEADLINE> HK Government Supports Electronic Transactions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) Government has decided to take the
lead in establishing a local public key infrastructure and a root
certification authority in Hong Kong to facilitate e-business.
</P>
<P>
The fast development of the Internet in the past few years has
provided new opportunities for businesses, such as lower-cost and
flexible sales, reduced unproductive inventory and more efficient
and focused service, HKSAR Secretary for Information Technology
and Broadcasting K C Kwong told a dinner meeting of the Business
Week Chief Information Officer (CIO) Forum here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, for a business to feel comfortable about
using the Internet in transactions with its suppliers and
customers, it needs to be sure of the identity of the other party
to the transaction and that any agreements made electronically are
binding.
</P>
<P>
The solution is for a safe and secure environment to be created
for the conduct of electronic commerce, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the Hongkong Post has been tasked
with the establishment of the public key infrastructure and its
certification service should be up and running by the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
In parallel, Kwong said, the SAR Government is preparing
legislation to prescribe that electronic records will have the
same legal status as their paper-based counterparts.
</P>
<P>
It will also provide for the voluntary registration of
certification authorities and the legal recognition of digital
signatures accompanied by certificates issued by these registered
authorities, he added.
</P>
<P>
To encourage the community to engage in electronic commerce,
Kwong said, the SAR Government will take the lead in providing
government services on line over the Internet under the Electronic
Service Delivery scheme (ESD).
</P>
<P>
The purpose is to improve the delivery of government services
on one hand and to drive the development of electronic commerce on
the other, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This will in turn spur the development of more electronic
commerce, in both variety and volume, in Hong Kong," he said,
noting that the first phase of ESD would be implemented by the
latter half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, more than 120 top information officers from
around the world attended the CIO Forum to discuss how best
information technology (IT) can be used to navigate and regenerate
businesses through the current economic downturn in the region.
</P>
<P>
The two-day forum, entitled "Leading Change: Business Alignment
Through Information Technology," addresses issues such as e-
business, the year 2000 problem, insourcing and outsourcing and
supply-chain management.
</P>
<P>
Forum organizers said the CIOs are playing a far more important
role today than before and this forum comes at a time when IT
development is at the top of the agenda for Asia's governments and
companies alike.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Accuses Eritrea of Repatriating 2,500 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia has accused the
Eritrean government of recently repatriating over 2,500 Ethiopians
without first notifying the International Committee of the Red
Cross (ICRC), which in turn was unable to inform Ethiopia of the
pending repatriation.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here Tuesday, Ethiopian government
spokesperson Selome Taddesse said the Ethiopian government was
"incapable of making the necessary preparations for their
arrival."
</P>
<P>
The repatriated were "thus dumped at the border town of Humera
-- a precarious area during this time of war -- without access to
such basic needs as food and shelter," she said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she announced Tuesday that the fighting continued
between Ethiopian and Eritrean forces in the vicinity of Merer
River, near Shembeko.
</P>
<P>
The western front of the border war near the Shembeko started
last Friday. Fighting at central front of Zalambessa-Egela which
started on March 14, has ceased.
</P>
<P>
The Organization of African unity (OAU) has described the
border war between the two Horn of Africa neighbors as "a matter
of profound regret".
</P>
<P>
OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim said Monday at the
just-ended 69th Session of OAU Council of Ministers that despite
efforts by OAU, "the war resumed with greater intensity... with
its attendant loss of life and destruction and its complicating
consequences for the peace process."
</P>
<P>
He called on both countries to end fighting immediately and
implement the OAU peace proposal.

<HEADLINE> African FMs Demand UNITA Leader Cease Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The African foreign ministers
 Wednesday demanded that Angola's rebel UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi
 "immediately cease military activities and surrender all armament
in the spirit of national reconciliation."
</P>
<P>
The 69th Ordinary Session of the Council of Ministers of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) has adopted a "decision on
Angola", reiterating that Savimbi and his military wing have not
honored their obligations as provided for in the 1994 Lusaka
Protocol, in the United Nations Security Council and OAU
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The council said the above-mentioned fact is "the root cause
underlying the resumption of war and the impasse in the
implementation of the peace process."
</P>
<P>
It strongly supports the decision made by the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) summit held in Mauritius in September
1998 at which the chairman of the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) was declared a war criminal, and an
appeal was made for the strengthening of measures with a view to
fully isolate him.
</P>
<P>
The council supports the efforts made by the Angolan government
in a bid to put an end to the war and promote democracy and
national reconciliation in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
The "decision on Angola", which was the only one adopted by the
council on African conflict situation, appeals to OAU member
states "to strictly apply the package of sanctions adopted by the
U.N. Security Council, particularly those imposed on the
travelling of UNITA leaders and decision-makers as well as on the
means of communication."
</P>
<P>
The decision further appeals to the international community to
provide economic and humanitarian aid required for the
reconstruction of Angola, particularly the rehabilitation of the
infrastructure destroyed by the war.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Producers Warn of Collapse of Local </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 24 (Xinhua) -- West African Portland Cement
Company (WAPCO) of Nigeria has warned of imminent collapse of
local cement industry as imported cement has increased
tremendously.
</P>
<P>
Records compiled by the WAPCO from eight cement factories in
the country showed that local cement production fell by more than
30 percent while import of the commodity rose by 130 percent over
the past nine years.
</P>
<P>
According to the records, while 3.03 million tons of cement
were produced in 1990 in the west African country, the figure
dropped to 2.2 million tons in 1998.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, imported cement increased from 905,595
tons to 2. 15 million tons, the records showed.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Makoju, managing director of the WAPCO, was quoted by
Wednesday's Daily Times as saying that unless the trend arrested,
Nigeria would depend entirely on import for its cement
requirements in the next five year.
</P>
<P>
He described the situation as a sad development, saying the
product is fundamental for infrastructural development and the
nation has comparative advantage because of the 100 percent local
raw material availability.
</P>
<P>
Makoju attributed the situation to the previous governments'
policies which tend to favor active promotion of cement import,
adding the major problems confronting Nigeria's cement industry
include persistent shortage of energy and the flood of cheap
cement imports from South East Asia.
</P>
<P>
The South East Asian countries, he said, recently devalued
their currencies, and could price their manufactured goods very
low in dollar terms.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he noted, their modern high-volume, low-cost
cement plants could produce cement at manufacturing cost of about
20 dollars per ton while local factories are producing at an
average manufacturing cost of about 62 dollars per ton.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Asks for Switch of Site of Table Tennis Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OSLO, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Sweden would not compete at the
world table tennis championships, planned to be hosted in
Yugoslavian capital Belgrade, unless the event is moved to another
country, a Swedish table tennis official has said.
</P>
<P>
Swedish Table Tennis Association chief Ulf Loennqvist told
Swedish newspapers on Tuesday that his organization had made a
written request to the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF)
that the event be switched to another country.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish table tennis body made the decision out of
consideration of the political and security situations in
Yugoslavia, he said.
</P>
<P>
Loennqvist said if the ITTF insisted on holding the event in
Belgrade, it would become a regional event with much smaller scale.
</P>
<P>
The official added that Sweden would also not send a delegation
to the ITTF Congress if it was held there.
</P>
<P>
"We are still waiting for the final decision from ITTF before
considering how to act. If the event is held in Belgrade, it will
eventually become something like an Asian championships,"
Loennqvist was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, national table tennis associations
in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Austria, France, Denmark,
Norway, Finland, England and Italy have decided not to participate
in the championships in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The ITTF will decide on Thursday how to cope with the situation.

TIANJIN, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The CTS (Tianjin) Electronics
Company Ltd. went into operation today in Tianjin Municipality.
</P>
<P>
The new company was previously a branch of the Motorola Company
of the United States.
</P>
<P>
This is an indication of an increasing trend to combine assets
among local overseas-funded enterprises in the Tianjin Development
Zone.
</P>
<P>
The 100-year old US-based CTS Company took a stake in Motorola
by buying the branch for 150 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Joseph P. Walker, CTS president, said that his company will
continue its close cooperation with the Motorola Company and he is
confident that this combining of assets will be successful.
</P>
<P>
CTS mainly produces electronic components such as filters and
other special parts for the telecommunications, computer and
automobile industries. Its branch in Tianjin provides components
for mobile telephone manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Motorola is the largest and the most successful American

He laid out China's stance on the Kosovo issue by saying, "The
Chinese government opposes the use of force or the threat of the
use of force in international affairs, and opposes interference in
other nation's internal affairs no matter what the excuse or by
what means, and opposes any random action that circumvents the U.N.
Security Council."
</P>
<P>
China is asking all those involved to continue all efforts to
reach a political settlement in the Kosovo issue by peaceful means,
he went on to say.
</P>
<P>
Yang reiterated the Chinese government's stance in insisting
that the Kosovo issue is Yugoslavia's internal affair and a "
problem that can only be solved through dialogue based on a
respect of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia
and an ensuring of the lawful rights of all ethnic groups in
Kosovo."

<HEADLINE> China to Expand Judicial Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Over 1,000 work groups will be
dispatched to local procuratorates to rate the professional
integrity of Chinese prosecutors as part of an effort to expand
the internal restructuring of the nation's judiciary.
</P>
<P>
Procurator-General Han Zhubin announced today that the Supreme
People's Procuratorate (SPP) will also introduce a three-year
training and education program for all chief prosecutors in local
procuratorates.
</P>
<P>
Han said the goal of the measures is to "consolidate the
results" of the judicial restructuring campaign initiated last
year, and root black sheep tarnishing the image of the nation's
hundreds of thousands of prosecutors."
</P>
<P>
Han made the remarks during a national teleconference focusing
the opinions and criticism deputies to the National People's
Congress tabled concerning the work report he presented during the
annual NPC Session held earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
He said NPC deputies not only tabled a number of "insightful"
opinions, criticism and suggestions on last year's restructuring
and the SPP's work, but also reaffirmed its achievements.
</P>
<P>
"We must take them seriously," said Han.
</P>
<P>
He vowed to hold chief prosecutors fully responsible for
ensuring the professional integrity of subordinates.
</P>
<P>
Han said that reform to the current prosecution system will be
key to preventing and eradicating judicial corruption.
</P>
<P>
Han also listed the following aspects of reform: strengthening
the general public's supervision of prosecutorial activities;
assigning chief prosecutors responsibility for certain cases;
instituting an expert consultation mechanisms; improving the work
of procuratorate prosecution committees; streamlining internal
structures; and restructuring the personnel system.
</P>
<P>
"We must ensure the comprehensive enforcement of reform
measures and I expect to see concrete results during 1999," said
Han.
</P>
<P>
He instructed prosecutors to intensify the work against
corruption and focus on what he called "major and important cases"
related to crimes committed by high-ranking officials and cases
involving large sums of illicit money.
</P>
<P>
He added that prosecutors must prove their cases based on hard
evidence, due process and discretion in order to ensure
convictions stand the test of time.
</P>
<P>
"Any violations of the law or discipline by prosecutors will
not be tolerated," said Han.

<HEADLINE> Faction Fighting, Banditry Attacks Kill 8 Somalis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 24 (Xinhua) -- At least eight people were
killed and as many as 16 others were wounded in three separate and
terrible incidents in Mogadishu Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
A serious shooting took place between rival militiamen loyal to
faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed at Sisi area of North Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses told reporters Wednesday that four people were
killed on the spot while seven others were wounded. All victims
were innocent civilians, many of whom were having tea in the
shades of the trees before the tea shops, they added.
</P>
<P>
Another even more serious shooting took place in the busy
Manapolio market of North Mogadishu late Tuesday.  At least three
people including two women were killed during the exchange of fire
while nine others were wounded near the market place.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said the deceased women were on board a public
transport minibus passing through the market and caught in the
cross fire.
</P>
<P>
The rival militiamen whom the people said were from the same
subclan of Harti-Abgal loyal to Ali Mahdi had fled the area after
each side had faced an unexpected resistance form the other side.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the attacks are not known.
</P>
<P>
However, militiamen close to those fighting against the militia
 commander Abdullahi Dhahan said that they had something to do
with the banditry activity which occurred last week when a vehicle
was looted.
</P>
<P>
The reports said Dhahan and his militiamen had pursued bandits
who looted the vehicle to Jowhar town, some 90 kilometers north of
Mogadishu, and killed one of them before taking the looted vehicle
back forcefully from the gunmen.
</P>
<P>
Annoyed bandits from the same subclan of those who looted the
vehicle had ambushed Dhahan and his men at Sisi area of North
Mogadishu in retaliation to his attack on the bandits.
</P>
<P>
Another man, an elderly Sheikh, was killed in a separate
banditry attack near Bakara market of South Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitnesses, the Sheikh was killed and some money
he was carrying with him was taken away after three armed young
men had attacked him on his way to taking a bus to his house in
Wardhigley District of the capital.
</P>
<P>
The reason is said to have been one of the day-light banditry
activities in Mogadishu where there's no single authority dealing,
or planning to deal, with the lawlessness which persisted in the
Somali capital in the past eight years.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Muslim Leader on Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The leader of Indonesia's
largest Muslim group said here on Wednesday that he believed the
June elections in his country would be open and fair.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the Institute of Defense and Strategic Studies
of Singapore, Abdurrahman Wahid, leader of the Nahdlatul Ulama
(NU), said the June 7 elections would be open and fair based on
observations of four key institutions on the military and
civilians.
</P>
<P>
"The second thing is that participating parties would like to
see a fair election, otherwise the punishment would be too high,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"The elections would be good, the monitoring would be good as
well," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
On difficulties facing Indonesia in the coming elections, Wahid
said where the money will come from is the biggest headache for
Indonesia. But he expressed the belief that Indonesia would manage
to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
Wahid also outlined his political and economic policies.
</P>
<P>
Wahid said he is for a new form of politics and a new form of
institutions of state.
</P>
<P>
"We have to give provinces full autonomy," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Governors and district leaders would not be appointed by
Jakarta and instead be elected by the population," he added,
saying Jakarta now has too much a say in the internal affairs of
the provinces.
</P>
<P>
He also vowed to maintain unity by changing the revenue sharing
scheme between Jakarta and provinces.
</P>
<P>
Wahid expressed the hope that the law would be observed and
equal treatment would be given to people from all walks of life.
</P>
<P>
He also said he is for the freedom of expression,
responsibility of government to the people and a supreme court to
be independent of the executive.
</P>
<P>
The Soeharto and Habibie governments depend too much on import,
he said. "We want to build another economy that is oriented to the
use of our own resources and looks to the outside only if
necessary."
</P>
<P>
"We want to keep profit to ourselves," he stressed. "If our
policy is right, we could manage to get better."

<HEADLINE> Albanian Cabinet Meets to Discuss Situation over Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Prime Minister Pandeli
Majko on Wednesday called an emergency cabinet meeting in the
small hours to discuss what further steps to take in regards to
the situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, which began at 02:30 local time, Majko, in the
presence of reporters, read a solidarity letter sent to him by
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana, after he had given the go-
ahead for the alliance to launch air raids against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to stress that the Alliance will very seriously
consider any attack by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia against
your country. The alliance has repeatedly made clear that the
security of each of the NATO members is inseparably linked with
that of all the nations of the Partnership. Your security is a
concrete and direct concern of the Alliance," said the letter.
</P>
<P>
The meeting then continued behind doors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Second Infantry Division in Kukes prefecture
neighboring Kosovo has been put on high alert, not only along the
border, but also in deeper regions.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman of the division, Azem Perllaku, told the Albanian
Telegraph Agency (ATA) that a part of the forces is on the alert
to intervene if needed, while the division's commanding staff are
in constant touch with the government and the army general staff.
</P>
<P>
Perllaku said that this unit has been reinforced considerably.
</P>
<P>
He said that Tuesday night the mobile forces of the division
carried out another alert drill and that the staff of the division
are working out all possible variants to cope with a military
aggression against Albania.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Kenya Names New Anti-Graft Chief to Meet IMF Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The president said in a statement that Ringera would be
seconded to the authority by the Judiciary.
</P>
<P>
Almost all the Kenyan national newspapers reported this
appointment on their front pages and hailed this move as an
important action in the fighting against corruption.
</P>
<P>
The appointment comes in the wake of a police crackdown on
vehicle smuggling, fake security documents, such as dollars, bank
notes, logbooks, death and birth certificates.
</P>
<P>
Ringera has been the solicitor-general since 1997, and taught
in the Faculty of Law at the University of Nairobi for more than
10 years and was a practising advocate before his elevation to a
judge.
</P>
<P>
Ringera takes over at the helm of the authority, replacing its
first director John Harun Mwau who served the body for seven
months before being suspended and subsequently facing of a
tribunal appointed by President Moi to look into whether he was
capable and competent to head the organization.
</P>
<P>
Government officials said earlier that they were considering
offering the post to a foreign national, but business leaders
opposed a foreign appointment on the grounds that there were more
suitable kenyan candidates.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's appoint brings to a close speculations that a
foreigner was geared to take the post.
</P>
<P>
It is also believed that the appointment is aimed at paving the
way for the resumption of aid talks with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The appointment of the anti-graft chief has been one of the
conditionality imposed by the IMF and the World Bank for the
resumption of aid talks. The other demanded by the two
institutions is fiscal discipline in the financial sector,
including the Treasury.
</P>
<P>
The IMF said early this month that Kenya must name a director
and deputy director of KACA before the talks on the loan agreement
could restart.
</P>
<P>
The IMF suspended its Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facilities
- a three-year loan agreement totaling 205 million U.S. dollars
to Kenya in July, 1997, due to grave graft and poor governance,
which pushed Kenya's economic structural reform into a dire
predicament.
</P>
<P>
The IMF sent a six-member technical team to Kenya a month ago
for the resumption of the suspended aid.
</P>
<P>
After two-week investigations, the team concluded that Kenya
had met three of four conditions imposed by the IMF, and the only
one remained was the appointment of a director of the KACA.
</P>
<P>
The IMF mission also said that the Kenyan government had made
 considerable progress in strengthening fiscal and monetary
policies in 1998.
</P>
<P>
With the appointment of the KACA director, the Kenyan
government showed its sincerity and greater efforts for tackling
the graft issue and paved the way for its talks with IMF.
</P>
<P>
However, the ball is now rolling to the IMF side. The Kenyan
government and people are to wait and see when will the IMF
realize its promise.

<HEADLINE> HK Remains Secure as Regional Service Center: Economist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Harvard economist Jeffery Sachs
said here Wednesday that Hong Kong's position as a regional
service center will not be easily taken away though the economy
is now struggling in a recession.
</P>
<P>
Professor Sachs told a press conference: "Hong Kong and
Singapore will continue to have unique advantages that won't
easily be taken away."
</P>
<P>
The two places remain secure in such regional functions as
financial and information technology centers, said Sachs, who
predicted that no other Asian cities or cities out of Asia can
take their places in the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
He said their competitive edge depends on underlying strength
and growth in other parts of Asia.
</P>
<P>
Although Hong Kong is in continuing deflation, it remains one
of the richest, freest and well-managed economies in the world,
said the Harvard economist.
</P>
<P>
Sachs is here as a keynote speaker at the three-day Credit
Suisse First Boston second Asian investment conference, which
started Wednesday. He delivered an address entitled "Major

<HEADLINE> Over Half HKIFA Members Plan to Join MPF Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 24 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey shows that at
least half of the member fund companies of the Hong Kong
Investment Funds Association (HKIFA) plan to participate in the
Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) market.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the survey conducted by the HKIFA in February
among member fund companies "is to provide insight into the
positioning of the fund management industry in the MPF market, as
well as the role that fund managers will assume in this market,"
HKIFA Chairman Desmond Chan said.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 50 member fund companies, 46 companies responded to
the survey, representing a response rate of 92 percent. And of
these 46 responding companies, 25 companies indicate they will
participate in the MPF market.
</P>
<P>
The 25 companies all will offer investment management services,
which represent their core business.
</P>
<P>
As for the types of investment management products to be
offered, 13 companies indicate they will offer master trusts and
15 companies say they will offer underlying funds.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 19 companies indicate they will set up segregated
funds or offer approved MPF products for employer-sponsored
schemes.
</P>
<P>
"As the survey indicates, most fund managers would be focusing
on providing investment management services. They would work
closely with trustees, banks, insurance companies and investment
consultants which will play an important role in administration
and distribution," Chan said.
</P>
<P>
The HKIFA consists of 50 fund management companies as full
members. They manage assets totaling about 100 billion U.S.
dollars of SFC-authorized unit trusts and mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
It also has 45 associates, including trustees, lawyers and
other professionals who are involved in the creation and
administration of funds.

QINHUANGDAO, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Shanhai Pass in the city of
Qinhuangdao in China's Hebei Province hosted 1.75 million tourists
and earned 280 million yuan from tourism in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Tourism dominated the local service trade which generated 620
million yuan in earnings in the past year, contributing to 60
percent of this seaside summer resort's GDP.
</P>
<P>
Shanhai Pass is situated between the Yanshan Mountains and the
Bohai Bay, between north and northeast China. It is the eastern
end of the Ming Section of the Great Wall, the most famous part of
the Great Wall, which was built some 350 years ago. Since 1985
when the late senior Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping called on the
whole nation to love and renovate the Great Wall, the city
government has spent more than 60 million yuan on improving this
tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization has put the Badaling Section of the Great Wall, also
a popular tourist destination north of Beijing, on the World
Heritage List.

<HEADLINE> China Urges NATO Not To Take Military Action Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- China is urging NATO to cancel
its decision to launch military strikes against Yugoslavia
immediately, Vice Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi said here this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Yang repeated the statement in two separate meetings with
Yugoslavia's Ambassador to China Slobodan Unkovic and U.S. Charge
d'affaires William C. McCahill.
</P>
<P>
He laid out China's stance on the Kosovo issue by saying, "The
Chinese government opposes the use of force or the threat of the
use of force in international affairs, and opposes interference in
other nation's internal affairs no matter what the excuse or by
what means, and opposes any random action that circumvents the U.N.
Security Council."
</P>
<P>
China is asking all those involved to continue all efforts to
reach a political settlement in the Kosovo issue by peaceful means,
he went on to say.
</P>
<P>
Yang reiterated the Chinese government's stance in insisting
that the Kosovo issue is Yugoslavia's internal affair and a "
problem that can only be solved through dialogue based on a
respect of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia
and an ensuring of the lawful rights of the ethnic Albanians."

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Govt Officials Barred From Holding Campaigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's General Election
Committee (KPU) Wednesday decided to bar all government officials,
from central to village administration levels, including
ministers, from participating in campaigns during the June general
election.
</P>
<P>
The decision is taken based on the outcome of a vote among
members of the KPU.
</P>
<P>
"As many as 46 voted to agree to bar government officials from
campaigning and 22 votes disagree. It means KPU's decision is to
bar them from participating in campaigns until the end of the
general election," KPU chairman Rudini told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said if any party tries to violate the committee's decision,
there will be a sanction against them.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, member of the KPU from the ruling Golkar party
Mahadi Sinambela said that although they regret the final
decision, the party will have to accept it.
</P>
<P>
"I think there is no problem for Golkar to hold a campaign
without a minister, as there are many Golkar cadres who have the
ability to campaign," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Golkar party leader Marzuki Darusman said it will
reconsider its political support to the cabinet if President B.J.
Habibie agrees with the ban.
</P>
<P>
Most government ministers are Golkar members.
</P>
<P>
"If President Habibie wants to be 'reelected,' he has to lobby
members of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR). Golkar itself
will assess how far the MPR can support President Habibie's
nomination. This matter will very likely influence Golkar party's
presidential nomination," Darusman said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 48 political parties will contest the June 7 general
election. The multi-party elections will elect a new House of
Representatives, whose members will be part of the 700-strong MPR,
the nation's highest legislative body, which will select the next
president.
</P>
<P>
Under former president Soeharto, who was forced to step down on
May 21 last year, only three parties were allowed to contest
elections. They were the Golkar party, the United Development
Party and the Indonesian Democratic Party.

<HEADLINE> Hungary Not to Be Directly Involved in NATO Airstrikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian Prime Minister Orban
Viktor said on Wednesday that his country will not participate
directly in NATO's threatened military actions against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
So far, there has been no indication that NATO's air strikes
will jeopardize Hungary's security, Orban said in a radio address
while commenting on the situation in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Even if such a situation occurs, Hungary will still be safe, as
it is already a NATO member and will be under the umbrella of
NATO's defense system, Orban said.
</P>
<P>
However, the prime minister said, the possibility for solving
the Kovoso crisis through peaceful means still exists, although it
is diminishing.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Martonyi Janos told a
local newspaper on Tuesday that his country has always hoped that
the Kosovo issue could be solved through a political means. Even
if NATO resorts to force, its military actions should be limited
ones.
</P>
<P>
Hungarian leaders have said that the country would not
participate directly in NATO military strikes. If required by NATO,
Hungary will send small technical and medical teams to Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Hungarian parliament has passed a bill to
allow NATO to use its airspace, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana on Tuesday ordered
airstrikes against Yugoslavia, saying all efforts for a negotiated
solution to the Kosovo crisis had failed.
</P>
<P>
"All efforts to achieve a negotiated, political solution to
the Kosovo crisis having failed, no alternative is open but to
take military action," Solana told reporters at the headquarters
of the Western alliance in Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav Serbs have recently refused to sign an agreement with
the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, saying the agreement violated
Yugoslavia's sovereignty.

<HEADLINE> China's Airlines Continuing Growth Over Next 20 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- China's airlines are expected to
maintain an annual growth rate of 8.1 percent over the next 20
years, compared to the world's average of 4.9 percent, according
to Boeing estimates.
</P>
<P>
During that period China's airlines are expected to purchase 1,
800 jetliners valued at 125 billion U.S. dollars, making China the
world's second largest commercial aviation market, after the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Jim Klein, the director of international public relations and
advertising for Boeing's commercial airplane division, during a
recent visit to China, pointed to the brilliant achievements in
cooperation between China and Boeing over the past 28 years.
</P>
<P>
Chinese airlines have 477 jetliners, 324 of which are Boeing
products. In the past five years, Boeing has put hundreds of
millions of dollars into training and equipment to help Chinese
airlines improve flight safety and efficiency. More than 4,300
flight and maintenance personnel have been trained by Boeing.
</P>
<P>
Klein said that key parts made in China have been installed on
more than 3,100 Boeing jetliners that are in service worldwide.
Chinese manufacturers have also participated in parts design and
manufacturing for the next generation of 737s, he says and
expressed confidence in the rapid growth of China's economy in the
future.
</P>
<P>
He said that the annual growth rate of China's GDP was 3.5
times that of North America and Europe for the past 23 years, and
in the next 20 years, China will become the fastest growing region
in the world.

<HEADLINE> Too Early to Talk About Response to NATO Strike: Russian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 24 (Xinhua) -- It is now too early to talk about
Moscow's responding moves to NATO's possible use of force against
Yugoslavia, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said on Wednesday,
when taking a question from the press.
</P>
<P>
He said the power to decide on any move belongs to President
Boris Yeltsin in his capacity of Russia's supreme commander and
diplomatic chief.
</P>
<P>
Press reports here said Ivanov urged public figures in Russia
not to rush to commenting on the issue as what they say would not
necessarily be put into practice.
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign minister stressed that there was no reason
whatsoever to carry out military actions against Yugoslavia; there
has been no decision from the UN Security Council nor any law
which allows NATO to resort to force.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov noted that he had telephone talks late Tuesday with some
of his Western counterparts, including U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, warning them of possible serious consequences
of such inconsiderate military actions.
</P>
<P>
"After using force, any sensible person would ask what to do
next, and no one can answer this question," he said.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Genocide Suspect Open to Trial by Any </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Bernard Ntuyahaga, a
Rwandan genocide suspect released by the International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) last week, is open to trial by any
state, ICTR registrar Agwu Ukiwe Okali said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Okali said that Ntuyahaga can be re-arrested in the future even
by the ICTR on the basis of other charges or by any government or
authority with a legitimate interest, said an ICTR press release
reaching here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Tribunal's decision to release him as a consequence of the
prosecutor dropping charges has not made him any better off than
before he was arrested, Okali said.
</P>
<P>
Ntuyahaga, 47, a Major in the former Rwandan Armed Forces,
surrendered himself to the Tribunal on July 10, 1998 and was
indicted on September 29 with one count, namely crimes against
humanity (murder).
</P>
<P>
He was allegedly responsible for disarming and arresting the 10
Belgian soldiers who were sent to escort Rwandan Prime Minister
Agathe Uwilingiyimana before they were killed on April 7, 1994.
</P>
<P>
The ICTR Tribunal last Thursday granted the prosecution leave to
withdraw its indictment against Ntuyahaga and set him free.
</P>
<P>
But Ntuyahaga has since preferred to stay in the United Nations
custody for fear of being extradited to Rwanda or Belgium which
have both sought his trial in their courts.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed the tribunal's ruling for his acquittal.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the extradition requests to Tanzania by Belgium
and Rwanda, the registrar said that is not a question for the
Tribunal, but one between the states concerned.
</P>
<P>
"The Tribunal has no preference for any country's interests,
and indeed, has denied Belgium's request for Ntuyahaga to be
handed over to that country or any other country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Okali said that Ntuyahaga has been a free person since last
Thursday, but he has remained at his own request in the United
Nations Detention Facility (UNDF) on the outskirts of Tanzania's
north town of Arusha where the ICTR is based.
</P>
<P>
On a question as to whether the release of Ntuyahaga has
created a dangerous precedent by encouraging states to request for
trying tribunal suspects in national courts, the registrar said
that any such danger has been forestalled by the tribunal's clear
position that it does not have jurisdiction to do so and therefore
could not do so.
</P>
<P>
Ntuyahaga's release is a result of the bid by his prosecutor,
Othman Chande who argued that the withdrawal will promote the
exercise of concurrent jurisdiction by a state as contained in
article 8 of the statute of the tribunal.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the prosecutor's motion followed a request by the
Belgian government which has tried to transfer the trial of
Ntuyahaga to the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Established on November 8, 1994 by the United Nations Security
Council, the ICTR has the mandate to try persons suspected to be
responsible for genocide and other serious violations of the
international humanitarian law committed in the territory of
Rwanda between January 1 and December 31, 1994.
</P>
<P>
It also has the mandate to try Rwandan citizens responsible for
such violations committed in the territory of neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
The ICTR has so far issued 28 indictments against 45
individuals and a total of 36 indicted individuals are still in
custody, 35 of them in the UNDF in Arusha and one is detained in
Texas of the United States.

</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The president of the French Constitutional Council, former
Foreign Minister Roland Dumas, was forced to leave on "paid
holiday" on Tuesday after the latest revelation by his ex-
girlfriend Christine Deviers-Jonvour on his involvement in the Elf
affair.
</P>
<P>
-- In Kosovo, the logic of war has won. A few hours after the

Belgrade, NATO Secretary General Javier Solana ordered the
launching of military strikes against the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>

the failure of the mission to Belgrade by American Richard
Holbrooke. France has decided to participate in the military
actions which, said the foreign ministry, have become unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
-- The chiefs of state and government of the 15 European Union
countries are meeting on Wednesday in Berlin for a summit
consecrated to the reform of financing in the union, but the
summit risks to be dominated by the problem of succession of

<HEADLINE> Scholars Encourage Promoting Creative Spirit of Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- "Parents should nurture the
creative spirit of their children", according to Child
Psychologist Chen Huichang
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Wednesday seminar sponsored by the overseas
edition of People's Daily, Chen, a professor with the Child
Psychology Institute at Beijing Normal University, quoted an
article in the US-based Wall Street Journal as saying that Chinese
people constitute one of the world's wisest groups. However, the
article noted that members of the Chinese nationality rarely win a
Nobel Prize.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the reason to the fact that "various restraining
elements in China's education system" stifle the originality of
Chinese children.
</P>
<P>
Chen urged parents to refrain from attempts to "mold" children
according to their own ideals, but instead should help them
realize their ideals.
</P>
<P>
Bai Chunli, vice president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
noted that "one characteristic of the knowledge-based economy era
is to absorb new knowledge".
</P>
<P>
He stressed that individuals adept at acquiring knowledge will
be able to withstand the increasingly fierce competition.
</P>
<P>
Continuing education has emerged as the mainstream in the age
of knowledge. Experts in the fields of education, science and
technology should help people "acquire new knowledge" after
completing their formal education, said Bai.
</P>
<P>
Song Chaodi, president of the Clever Software (Group) Co. (CSC),
China's largest education software producer, stressed that the
information society requires people to re-consider the question of
how to study and the question of for what one should study.
</P>
<P>
Some 40 scholars and experts attending the seminar discussed
approaches for using science and technology to revitalize China.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Works for Debt Relief Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has taken
major steps in its efforts for negotiations with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) on debt relief from its creditors, This Day
newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In January, Nigeria drew up a Staff Monitored Program (SMP) and
 submitted the program to the IMF, and last month the Nigerian
government forwarded a memorandum on economic and financial
policies to the Bretton Wood institution.
</P>
<P>
In the memorandum, the Nigerian government explained in details
the policies it plans to implement to enable it to qualify for
discussion on the Medium Term Economic Strategy (MTS) which is the
precondition for negotiations on debt relief.
</P>
<P>
Last week, IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus, who was on a
three- day visit to Nigeria, said that the IMF board will meet in
July to assess how well Nigeria has implemented the SMP.
</P>
<P>
According to Camdessus, it is the quality of progress made by
the Nigerian government in the implementation of the SMP that will
determine if it can proceed to the next stage of MTS.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the SMP which is purely home-grown by Nigeria, the MTS
has the full involvement of the IMF by making available necessary
soft financial facilities.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum covers seven key policy areas: fiscal policy,
social expenditure and poverty alleviation; monetary and exchange
rate policy; domestic deregulation and privatization; trade and
exchange liberation; governance and institution building and
external debt management.
</P>
<P>
The major plank of its fiscal policy, according to the
memorandum, will be fiscal adjustment which aims to minimize the
adverse effects of the oil price slump and the disruption in
Nigeria's crude oil production.
</P>
<P>
These factors put together would reduce budgetary revenue in
1999 by an estimated 2.4 billion U.S. dollars which amounts to 6.8
percent of Nigeria's gross domestic product (GDP) in the
assumption that the average world oil price would be nine dollars
per barrel.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government said that its priority will be to
maintain macro-economic stability while allowing interest and
exchange rates to reflect market forces.
</P>
<P>
On the external debt management, the Nigerian government is
determined to normalize relations with the Paris Club by sending
reconciliatory missions to the creditor countries to establish
authenticity of all figures.

<HEADLINE> Looting of Ancient Treasures Continuing in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 24 (Xinhua) -- More than half of the nation's
invaluable art treasures have been stolen since 1986, despite
increased efforts to stop the thefts, according to a government
conservationist.
</P>
<P>
"They have vanished or been damaged as a result of theft or
warfare," an official of the Angkor Conservation Department was
quoted by the Cambodia Daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
"To my knowledge, looting is not decreasing. Looters will wait
for their chance and take any opportunity whenever authorities are
careless,"
the official said.
</P>
<P>
The thefts of statues and art treasures have slowed in recent
years thanks in part to the Heritage Police, set up with the help
of the international community in 1994, and the government's
measures. But the looting was still going on and getting seriously
these days.
</P>
<P>
In February, a priceless piece of a 12th-century relief was
stolen from the Banteay Thom temple in Siem Reap. Looters used
hammers and chisels to cut the 0.7-meter-long, one-meter-wide
relief from the temple's pillars.
</P>
<P>
In January, Thai police seized 117 ancient Cambodian sculptures
in the border province of Sa Kaeo, some 250 km east of Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Angkok, the heart of the Khmer empire dating back to the 7th
century and home to 273 of Hindu and Buddhist monuments, has
always been prey to thieves who sell their stolen wares mostly to
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Decades of civil war have also caused widespread damage to
temple sites around the country, and many of the looted sites were
damaged during fighting and have not yet been repaired.
</P>
<P>
Military Police Deputy Commander Prak Chanthoeun said tougher
action must be taken to stop the thefts of the treasures and save
the national heritage.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, special units have been created to investigate
thefts and police have been instructed in many areas to keep a
close eye on possible targets.

<HEADLINE> Observers Say Consumer Spending In China Will Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The sluggish domestic demand is
expected to change when state policies to stimulate the economy
begin to take effect in the second quarter of next year, the State
Internal Trade Bureau (SITB) says.
</P>
<P>
China's markets are growing and the buyer's market is not
likely to change in the short run, market observers say.
</P>
<P>
Increased input in infrastructure to stimulate demand and
increased production of cement, steel, and rolled steel are
expected to increase more profits than for consumer goods. China
passed financial policies last year to boost consumer spending and
some of them have had some effect.
</P>
<P>
As macro-economic policies take effect, consumer spending is
expected to gradually pick up, which will help avoid further
inflation and price rise and will encourage enterprises to improve
competitiveness to survive.

<HEADLINE> National Strike Paralyzes Israeli Public Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 24 (Xinhua) - Some 400,000 employees in
Israel's public sector Wednesday joined a nationwide strike
launched by about 80,000 public workers nine days ago,
effectively disrupting essential services in the country.
</P>
<P>
All government ministries, government hospitals, post offices
and some state-run companies were closed. National television and
radio stations were disrupted, and passenger traffic was entangled
in the Ben-Gurion International Airport.
</P>
<P>
The strike was expected after the Histadrut, or labor
federation, and the Treasury failed to find a compromise in their
talks Tuesday night over a dispute over a wage hike.
</P>
<P>
The Histadrut is demanding a salary hike of 14 percent for 1998
and 1999 to offset the wage erosion by the inflation, which stood
at 8.6 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
But the Finance Ministry insisted that it would not go higher
than a 3.85 percent increase, which it said is enough to maintain
the real value of wages.
</P>
<P>
The strike is expected to continue into Friday. The Histadrut
will decide Saturday whether the strike will continue into the
Pesach holiday, which falls on next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Senior Treasury officials charged the Histadrut intentionally
used the sanctions before the May elections in order to squeeze
concessions from the government.
</P>
<P>
In his response, Histadrut Chairman Amir Peretz said, "if it
takes elections for the workers to get their due raises, then so
be it."

<HEADLINE> No Decision on Postponing Declaring Statehood: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinians have not decided
whether to postpone the declaration of an independent state,
Palestinian Minister of Planning and International Cooperation
Nabil Shaath said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Egypt's Voice of Arab radio over telephone
from Washington, Shaath said that a postponement decision in this
regard must be "preceded by full consultations" among the
Palestinian institutions.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has repeatedly hinted
declaration of an independent Palestinian state on May 4 when the
five-year interim self-rule period enshrined in the 1993 Oslo
Accord expires whether a final settlement is reached in the
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Israel is opposed to the possible move, threatening to take
tough actions against the step, including annexation of the parts
of the West Bank under its control.
</P>
<P>
Shaath was accompanying Arafat in a visit to the United States,
during which Arafat has consulted with U.S. President Bill Clinton
on the possible declaration to win Washington's support for the
issue.
</P>
<P>
Shaath termed the talks held late Tuesday between Arafat and
Clinton as "positive."
</P>
<P>
Arafat will "thoroughly consider the different U.S. ideas" and
submit them to the Palestinian institutions for discussion in an
effort to make a final decision on the declaration of the future
Palestinian state, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Several countries have advised that the Palestinians may
declare their independent state on a later day. Reports have said
the Palestinians will hold a meeting among various groups early
April to seek a decision on the issue.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government has
decided to extend a grant of some 8.32 million U.S. dollars in aid
to Nepal as the third portion of debt relief measures in its 1998
fiscal year.
</P>

</P>
<P>
Japan has been extending the debt relief grant since the last
two decades to help the Nepalese government in procuring such
commodities as petroleum products, fertilizer, medicines, and
construction and transportation equipment.
</P>
<P>
The grant assistance was provided annually in two portions
until Japan's 1997 fiscal year, but it is now being provided in

<HEADLINE> Old Age Disease Strikes 13 Year-old Vietnamese Girl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Nguyen Thi Ngoc, a 13-year-old
Vietnamese girl, looks 70, because she has been struck by a rare
old-age disease, the Vietnam News reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The girl is only one-meter tall and weighs just 10 kg. Her skin
is thickened and her finger and toe-nails are almost gone.
</P>
<P>
An Binh hospital in Ho Chi Minh city said Ngoc is suffering
from the Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome, a rare disease that
turns children old.
</P>
<P>
International medical experts say there are only 100 cases of
the disease reported world-wide. The cause of the disease is
unknown and no remedy is available.
</P>
<P>
According to the Vietnam News, Ngoc was normal at birth. But
within six months, strange symptoms appeared. Her hair fell out
and she stopped growing when she was one meter tall.
</P>
<P>
Ngoc was brought by her parents to the hospital for the first
time in April 1998 because her nose was bleeding and she had
vomited blood.
</P>
<P>
X-ray revealed that Ngoc has osteoporosis, a condition of
softening bones.
</P>
<P>
She also suffers from diseases commonly found in elderly
people, such as hypertension, heart problems, high levels of
cholesterol in the blood and arteries which decreases the blood
supply to the brain and results in frequent headaches.
</P>
<P>
Medical experts estimate the life span of patients with
Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome at 13 to 27 years. Patients
usually die from heart attacks or endocrinological diseases.
</P>
<P>
An Binh hospital said medical science is unfamiliar with this
rare disease and can only offer the girl treatment to maintain her
health, for example, physiotherapy to treat her ankylosis.
</P>
<P>
Ngoc must return to the hospital two or three times a month for
examinations, therapy and medicines.

MANILA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Sporadic exchanges of mortar fire
erupted anew between government forces of the Philippines and
Muslim rebels in the southern province of Sultan Kudarat early

<HEADLINE> N.Zealand Economy Projected to Pick Up Next Two Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's economy should
pick up during the next two fiscal years, said the Institute of
Economic Research of New Zealand in its latest predictions.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate will be 2.8 percent for the fiscal year from
April 1999 to March 2000 and the momentum in growth will pick up
the following year to reach 4 percent, before easing gradually
over the rest of the study period to 2003.
</P>
<P>
Export growth will be the initial catalyst, although it will
vary widely across export sectors, and will be led by tourism in
the early stages, it said.
</P>
<P>
"However, the recovery will be vulnerable" over the year from
April 1999 to March 2000, it added.
</P>
<P>
Worsening international markets, a strengthening NZ dollar or
another drought could easily undermine growth, the Institute said.
</P>
<P>
The year started with a "hiss and a roar" followed by a host of
 positive indicators for the economy, including improved business
confidence and retail sales, firmer house prices, historically low
 interest rates, and improved trade balance and visitor numbers.

higher Wednesday as signs that prices for raw materials were
bottoming out proved positive for the commodity-driven Australian
currency.
</P>
<P>
The local currency closed in Sydney at 63.85 U.S. cents after
skipping ahead to 64.08 U.S. cents during the session, its highest
level since late February. It closed Tuesday night at 63.72 U.S.
cents.
</P>
<P>
Gold prices were actually down slightly Tuesday night, but
participants believe the tide may have turned for the precious
metal, at least for the time being.
</P>
<P>
Other metals gained ground and added to support for the
Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
Copper sustained strong gains Tuesday night, rising 60 U.S.
dollars to 1,421.50 U.S. dollars a tonne and nickel rose 37.50
U.S. dollars to 5,195 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Nickel, Lead and zinc also moved higher.
</P>
<P>
An agreement to cut production by oil cartel OPEC sparked the
positive sentiment on commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar often traces movements in commodity
prices because around two-thirds of the country's exports are raw
materials.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at the close of trading Wednesday, the Australian
dollar was at 75.02 Japanese yen from 75.54 yen and 0.5853 euro
from 0.5846 euro.
</P>
<P>
The euro was buying 1.0905 U.S. dollars from 1.0901 U.S.
dollars and 128.21 Japanese yen from 129.26 yen.

<HEADLINE> Namibian Ruling Party Heavyweight Forms New Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new party will be led by Namibia's former high commissioner
to Britain, Ben Ulenga, who was a leading member of the ruling
South West African People's Organization (Swapo).
</P>
<P>
Ulenga told a gathering of more than 1,000 supporters and
onlookers that the party would take part in this year's general
elections. The Party's motto would be "A New Beginning," he said.
</P>
<P>
He resigned as high commissioner to London last August in
protest against the lack of open debate in the Swapo as well as
constitutional amendments which will allow President Sam Nujoma to
rule for a third term.
</P>
<P>
According to Namibia's original constitution, the term of
office shall be five years and one may not hold the office of
presidency for more than two terms.
</P>
<P>
Ulenga is the first significant figure within Swapo to openly
break with the party since independence in 1990.
</P>
<P>
He told the gathering that a political vehicle had been forged
to "take people out of disillusionment and give them hope and
direction."
</P>
<P>
The Namibian society was "sick with symptoms of a deadly
disease," he said.
</P>
<P>
These symptoms included the country's military presence in the
Democratic Republic of Congo, the exodus of Namibians from the
Caprivi Strip and a "constitution re-tailored like a dress to fit
an individual."
</P>
<P>
A number of leading government figures are believed to have
expressed sympathy for Ulenga's stand and the idea of forming a
new party.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that none were expected to come forward to
join the party in the immediate future, according to the South
African newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Ulenga was suspended from Swapo's Central Committee last year
for his dissentient views.
</P>
<P>
In 1977 Ulenga was captured for his role in the fight for
independence and was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment on Robben
Island.
</P>
<P>
Following his release in 1985, he was appointed as the general
secretary of the Mine Workers Union of Namibia.
</P>
<P>
After Namibia's independence, Ulenga served as a member of the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
He was deputy minister of environment before receiving a
diplomatic posting to London.

<P>
Sources with the Beijing Software Engineering and Research
Center under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) note that the
new Chinese log-in system will offer an efficient way for Chinese
TV owners to realize their dream of surfing virtual space.
</P>
<P>
The user-friendly system will not only help TV users process
information and surf the Internet, but will also be widely used in
mini and hand-held computers, as well as the next generation of
personal digital assistance information processing devices.
</P>
<P>
Major domestic enterprises currently manufacturing and
retailing household appliances, as well as a number of computer
companies, have expressed great interest in the Chinese system or
have otherwise inked cooperation contracts with the center.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates unveiled the Venus Operating
System in Shenzhen during his sixth visit to China earlier this
month. Prices for the system range between 1,000-2,000 yuan (120-
360 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Computer experts note that the cost of Microsoft's system will
quite likely be beyond the reach of Chinese consumers, especially
when considering the additional cost for Windows CE. They said
that domestic consumers need low cost products and added that
Chinese software developers are fully capable of competing with
their foreign counterparts in the development of operating systems,
</P>
<P>
China is currently the world's largest market for household
appliances, with 90 percent of households owning 317 million TV
sets and 40 million video compact disk (VCD) players. The
nationwide telephone coverage has reached 25 percent, with the
figure in some cities hitting 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, approximately 95 percent of Chinese families have not
as yet purchased computers. Therefore, the new trend will focus on
the development of products which integrate information technology
with household appliances.

<HEADLINE> Computerization Plans Announced for Processing Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) has announced plans to allow
processing enterprises to apply for trade licenses through its
computer network beginning May 1, this year.
</P>
<P>
Provincial foreign trade and economic cooperation committees
and specified local trade administrations have also been
authorized to approve processing trade.
</P>
<P>
Regional trade administrations at all levels will be required
to transfer data related to approvals or cancellations of trade
licenses to higher authorities on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
China's processing trade sector has witnessed continuing rapid
growth in recent years and accounted for 53.4 percent of the total
export-import volume for commodities during 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, some enterprises have engaged in smuggling or foreign
exchange infractions under the guise of processing trade
activities. Sixty-three percent of 401 smuggling cases reported in
1997 involved processing trade, with the rate approaching 80
percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Liu Guosheng, director of MOFTEC's Department of Foreign Trade
Administration, said online approval for processing trade licenses
not only will improve the efficiency of the government, but will
also follow the sector's development and help stop administrative
loopholes.

ANKARA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Turkish newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- Turkey's Police General Director Necati Bilican announced
Tuesday three suspected terrorists have been caught in connection
with an arson attack on "Blue Market" shopping mall in Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
On March 13, 13 people were killed and six other injured in the
arson attack in the market, which caused a great panic in
Istanbul, the largest city of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- Administrators of the pro-Kurdish Med-TV based in Britain
are trying to move the TV station to Cyprus after British
Independent Television Commission stopped it broadcasting for 21

<HEADLINE> Chinese to Combat New Health Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese medical experts and
officials warn that any failure to control joint tuberculosis (TB)
and AIDS infections will threaten the health and well-being of the
nation's citizens.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization (WHO) used today's activities
marking "World Anti-Tuberculosis Day" to call on people around the
world to battle tuberculosis which infects 10 million and kills
some three million people each year.
</P>
<P>
The HIV/AIDS weakens the immune system and AIDS patients stand
a 30-50 percent greater chance of contracting tuberculosis. HIV
carriers contracting TB are much more likely to infect healthy
individuals.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Minister of Health, Yin Dakuei, noted that close
to a third of AIDS patients also suffer from TB.
</P>
<P>
An estimated six million Chinese suffer from pulmonary TB, with
two million individuals suffering from highly infectious forms of
the disease. TB hits at least 1.13 million Chinese residents
annually.
</P>
<P>
WHO recommends the use of "directly observed treatment, short
course" (DOTS) which calls for administering daily drug doses to
TB patients over a six-month period.
</P>
<P>
However, approximately half of China's population is not
covered by the DOTS program, with the problem especially acute in
remote poverty-stricken areas, where local people are caught in a
vicious circle of disease and poverty, warns Professor Zhang
Lixing, vice-president of China's Anti-Tuberculosis Association.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Minister of Health Yin said that his ministry is expected
to sponsor a national epidemiology survey on TB next year in order
to strengthen the control effort.

<HEADLINE> Oman to Give Death Penalty to Drug Traffickers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Drug traffickers are to face
death penalty in Oman from now on under a new law enforced through
a royal decree by Sultan Qaboos, the UAE's Khaleej Times daily
reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the law, published in the latest edition of the
Government Gazette, people found engaging in illegal import of
certain specified narcotics and psychotropic drugs would be liable
for capital punishment, the report said.
</P>
<P>
They would be sentenced to death or life imprisonment and
fined up to 25,000 riyals (about 65,000 dollars), the law said.
</P>
<P>
The decree added those found illegally sponsoring activities
that involve the import, exort or production of narcotics and
psychotropic drugs, either directly or indirectly, would meet
with the same punishment.
</P>
<P>
The same punishment, the decree said, would be given to those
who involve a minor in committing such crimes and those who belong
to or cooperate with any international narcotics smuggling groups
or syndicates.
</P>
<P>
The new law will also apply to those found misusing their
powers in either committing or facilitating such crimes.
</P>
<P>
Plants forbidden to be cultivated or imported include Indian
cannabis, charas, ganja, Indian hemp, kif and marijuana, the
decree said.

BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of China (BOC) is
providing credit to more than 70,000 customers via a computer

A bank spokesman was quoted in today's Economic Daily as saying
that giving credit to enterprises helps prevent financial risks

The amount of a bank loan to the company depends on its credit

<HEADLINE> China Breeds First Genetically Altered Calf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have reported
successfully producing a male calf on the afternoon of February 19
as the result of genetic engineering for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Yitao and Huang Shuzhen and other scientists, who are in
charge of genetic-engineering projects at the Shanghai Institute
of Medical Sciences and Genetics, told a national seminar on
transgenic animals held here today of the latest development.
</P>
<P>
Last year, they injected the human blood clotting agent Factor
IX into a the zygote of a goat which was then transplanted into
the womb of a female goat, resulting in the first transgenic goat
in China. It later produced milk containing Factor IX.
</P>
<P>
The scientists then used a similar method on a cow by
transplanting embryos grown in test tubes out of zygotes with
human albumin genes into eight cows last May, three of which
became pregnant, one of which gave birth to the transgenic calf.
</P>
<P>
In addition, by altering human genes before they are
transplanted into animals, the scientists have bred mice whose
milk has 1,400 nanograms of Factor IX per milliliter, as compared
with 45 nanograms in previous experiments.
</P>
<P>
Experts attending the seminar said that these achievements will
greatly benefit human albumin drug production using genetically
altered animal milk and this is specially important for the safety
of products derived from human plasma.

<HEADLINE> Harvard Economist Optimistic About Asia's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Harvard economist Jeffrey Sachs
said here Wednesday that the long-term perspective for Asia is
positive despite the financial turmoil that has dragged many
economies of the region into a recession.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening session of Credit Suisse First Boston's
second Asian investment conference, Professor Sachs said the whole
episode of the last two years in Asia was "a bad accident of
bubble bursting leading to financial panic."
</P>
<P>
"But there are no signs of fundamental collapse," said Sachs,
explaining that the panic ended when short-term debt stopped
flowing out of the beleaguered Asian economies in the summer of
1998.
</P>
<P>
He told the 600 participants: "All the reasons that we're
optimistic about Asia for the long term, I believe, are to be true.
The underlying strength of the region is real."
</P>
<P>
In his speech entitled "Major Challenges in East Asia's
Economic Recovery," the Harvard professor called Asia "an
incredibly resilient, dynamic region" with two-thirds of the
world's population and a great ability to adopt technology.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the "dramatic, rare and extraordinary but unnecessary
" withdrawal of short-term international capital from Asia in the
latter half of 1997 for triggering financial panic worldwide.
</P>
<P>
A tough critic of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Sachs
said the IMF rang alarm bell around the globe, creating a dramatic
sense of panic.
</P>
<P>
"IMF is the worst panic involved," said the economist, who on
many occasions rapped the IMF for making rescue packages
conditional on such issues as hiking interest rates and tightening
fiscal policy -- measures he said didn't help in abnormal
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
IMF Asia-Pacific representative Hubert Neiss, also a keynote
speaker at the conference, responded that strategies supported by
the IMF in Asian crisis countries have shown results --
stabilization achieved, recovery under way, and exchange rates
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
But the two shared some common ground on how Asia can move on
along its way of recovery. Sachs pointed out that lack of
liquidity is what Asia is facing now. "We need exchange rate
flexibility and regional cooperation on liquidity," he said.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Neiss said that one of the major elements of the IMF
strategy is to adopt expansionary macroeconomic policies to
support domestic demand. Both of them emphasized that the
restructuring of financial market, banks and corporate are
essential to the pace of recovery.
</P>
<P>
Sachs also stressed that the key to Asia's recovery is its
investment in human resources and its commitment to science and
technology. Both are vital to ensure the underlying long-term
export competitiveness of Asian economies, he said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Allied Planes, Ships Ready for Attacks on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. and allied warships and
bombers stand ready Wednesday to deliver a "swift and severe" blow
to Yugoslavia, starting with a U.S.-led barrage of sea- and air-
launched cruise missiles that would target Yugoslav air defense
systems and open the way to a larger-scale bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
The decision on when to start the attacks lay with U.S. Army
General Wesley Clark, NATO's top commander. NATO Secretary General
Javier Solana gave Clark the formal go-ahead Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
"No alternative is open but to take military action," Solana
said solemnly at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. He
announced his move just hours after last-ditch talks in Belgrade
between President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. special envoy
Richard Holbrooke ended in failure.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton prepared the nation for an imminent
attack on Serb targets, saying that although American troops would
be at risk, the air campaign is necessary for Europe's long-term
stability. Congress lined up behind him, dropping a move to cut
the financial rug from under U.S. military action.
</P>
<P>
"I want to level with you," Clinton said in a speech Tuesday, "
This is like any other military action. There are risks in it."
</P>
<P>
An opening volley of cruise missiles would be fired from four U.
S. Navy ships and two submarines in the Adriatic, along with one
British sub, plus Air Force B-52 bombers flying from a base in
England. Also likely to be among the first in action are U.S. Air
Force F-117 stealth fighter-bombers based in Italy.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon said Tuesday
that the Yugoslav Army was dispersing its air defense equipment in
anticipation of NATO airstrikes. Yugoslav officials, citing an "
imminent threat of war," declared a state of emergency, mobilized
troops and put the army on a high state of alert.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, appearing Tuesday
night on CNN's "Larry King Live" program, said, "The purpose of
this is to deter Slobodan Milosevic from continuing on his rampage
and going in and torching, having his soldiers and his special
police torch the villages. It is designed to deter that and also
to damage his capability to do that."
</P>
<P>
NATO has a force of 350 to 400 aircraft earmarked for
airstrikes in Yugoslavia. Just under 200 are American.
</P>
<P>
As NATO strikes appeared all but inevitable, Russian Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov registered his opposition by canceling a
Washington visit even as he flew to the U.S. on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to patch up differences with Moscow, Albright
spoke by telephone for more than half an hour with her Russian
counterpart, Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, according to Albright's
spokesman, James P. Rubin.
</P>
<P>
Albright told Ivanov she hoped the United States and Russia
could find a way "to deal with the situation and continue to work
in other ways," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Albright also conferred twice by telephone with Solana, the
NATO chief, and talked separately with the foreign ministers of
France, Britain and Germany.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate had been scheduled to take a major procedural
vote on legislation by Republican leaders designed to keep Clinton
from using U.S. military power in the Balkans crisis without
support from Congress first.
</P>
<P>
But after Clinton met with congressional leaders at the White
House, Senate leaders shifted gears and expressed support for
airstrikes.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Kosovo will never be allowed to
be separated from Yugoslavia, said Yugoslav ambassador to China
Slobodan Unkovic at a press conference exclusively for Chinese
press here today.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia will never allow North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) troops to enter Kosovo for the so-called supervision, and
will never accept any provision in any document to effect Kosovo
as a third Yugoslav republic, the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador highly valued China's principled stand on the
issue, saying he believed China, along with other peace-loving
nations, would make efforts to stop the looming military action
against his country.
</P>
<P>
At the press time, the press conference is still going on.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana Tuesday authorized NATO
military forces to launch air strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Qin Huasun, the Chinese permanent representative to the UN.,
said Tuesday that any military action against Yugoslavia without
the authorization of the UN. Security Council will be a severe
violation of the UN. Charter and the established principles of
international law and unacceptable by international community.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi said
that China strongly appeals to relevant parties to settle the
issue by continuing to hold negotiations in an appropriate and
just manner through exercising restraint and adopting a patient
and flexible attitude.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Chinese government holds that the Kosovo
issue is an internal affair of Yugoslavia and should be resolved
politically through dialogues on the basis of respecting the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia and
safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of various
ethnic groups in the Kosovo region.

<HEADLINE> Iran Says OPEC Decision Will Stabilize Oil Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar
Zanganeh stated on Tuesday that the recent agreement reached at
the 107th ministerial meeting of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) would stabilize the oil market.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) in
Vienna after the OPEC meeting, Zanganeh expressed satisfaction
with the outcome of meeting, in which OPEC and non-OPEC
members agreed to cut their oil outputs by 2,100,000 barrels
per day (bpd).
</P>
<P>
OPEC showed once again that it is powerful enough to
overcome market crisis, he said, expressing hope that all the
members would fully honor their commitments.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian minister underlined the importance of cooperation
of non-OPEC members, and said four non-OPEC oil producers
Mexico, Oman, Norway and Russia have agreed to reduce their
daily oil production by 400,000 barrels, which constitutes 20
percent of the total cut in oil production.
</P>
<P>
"This marks the first time that non-OPEC oil producers
cooperate with OPEC at such level," he said.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC members on Tuesday agreed to reduce their output
ceiling to 22.976 million bpd effective from April by cutting
1.72 million bpd after five major oil producers reached
agreement earlier this month to cut down output in order to
raise prices.
</P>
<P>
The initiative ended a year-long oil price slump and some
oil experts believe that oil price would reach 20 dollars per
barrel if the agreement would be observed by the OPEC members
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Hailing the cuts by oil producing countries, Iranian oil
officials said that the recent agreement heralds the end of
the "fourth oil shock," which started in 1997 and intensified
in 1998 due to increase in OPEC output, mild winter and
financial crisis in Southeast Asia.

<HEADLINE> Russell Tips the Balance as Utah Squeezes by Miami </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Bryon Russell played like a
chip off the old Jordan when he buried a winning three-pointer to
help the Utah Jazz escape with a 84-81 victory over Maimi Heat on
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
In Salt Lake, Russell drained the long jumper for his fourth 3-
pointer of the night after Jazz guard John Stockton drove to the
foul line and handed off to him on the right wing.
</P>
<P>
"I want to hit the winning shot in the championship game," said
Russell, who was victimised by Michael Jordan on the championship
shot last year.
</P>
<P>
"To hit a game-winning shot like tonight doesn't mean a thing,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Miami won most of the physical battles in the thriller as
Hardaway led all scorers with 30 points and center Alonzo Mourning
added 11 and 13 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
But the Heat wilted in front of the deafening home crowd and a
Jazz defense that played best when it counted the most.
</P>
<P>
Karl Malone collected 23 points and pulled down 15 rebounds.
Russell finished with 17 points and Stockton chipped in 12 points
and eight assists for the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
In Portland, the Trail Blazers had to make use of 5-of-6 free
throws in the final 79 seconds to seal their fifth straight win 79-
72 over the Golden State Warriors, who was held scoreless in the
final three minutes.
</P>
<P>
In San Antonio, twin towers Tim Duncan and David Robinson led
the Spurs to a 112-82 rout of the Denver Nuggets while in
Cleveland, with six players in double figures the Cavaliers
pounded the Boston Celtics 113-86.
</P>
<P>
In Orlando, the Magic outplayed the Charlotte Hornets 86-78 as
the Raptors got off to a fast start and slammed Bulls 113-90, the
first win in Chicago.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Parliament Enacts Tax Cut Bills for Fiscal 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Diet (parliament) on
Wednesday enacted a set of six bills aimed at implementing tax
cuts worth 9.4 trillion yen (about 79.9 billion U.S. dollars) in
fiscal 1999.
</P>
<P>
The tax cuts include cuts to income and corporate taxes as well
as increased deductions for housing loans, which were approved at
the plenary session of the opposition-controlled House of
Councilors, or the upper house of the Diet.
</P>
<P>
The bills, expected to stimulate slumping personal consumption,
are part of key measures by the Japanese government to boost the
stagnant economy.
</P>
<P>
Under the bills, income tax cuts will be implemented
retrospective to January.
</P>
<P>
The effective corporate tax rate will be down to 40.87 percent
from 46.36 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Japan's taxpayers who buy homes within the next
two years will be able to deduct a maximum of about 5.88 million
yen (about 49,000 dollars) from income tax over 15 years.

<HEADLINE> France to Join NATO Military Actions Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 24 (Xinhua) -- France will take part in North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) military operations related to
the Kosovo crisis, the foreign ministry announced in a communique
released here early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The communique said, "President Jacques Chirac and the
government have decided that French armed forces would take part
in NATO military operations that have become inevitable" after
Belgrade refused to meet the international community's demands to
end all offensives in Kosovo and sign the Rambouillet accords.
</P>
<P>
"By persisting in this attitude during the last-ditch efforts
made with him, President (Slobodan) Milosevic bears the entire
responsibility for the consequences resulting from this refusal,
of which he was fully warned," said the communique.
</P>
<P>
The statement went on to say that all political means had been
used to convince the Yugoslav authorities to choose a negotiated
solution and peace, but such means were now exhausted.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in Berlin, Chirac, who is there to attend a European
Union summit, signed an "instruction" to French armed forces chief
of staff Jean-Pierre Kelche ordering him to take his forces into
action in line with NATO decisions on Kosovo, presidential
spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said.

SHENYANG, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Jialing Industrial Co. Ltd.,
China's number one producer of motorcycles, will take effective
measures to fight against counterfeit and shoddy motorcycles that
harm both consumers and the company.

<HEADLINE> Manila Expects Rebels to Release Hostages Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Wednesday that National Democratic Front (NDF) rebels may release
five police and military officers next week, when government
forces are to suspend military operations against them.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said in an interview that
the government is hopeful that the NDF will respond positively to
the suspension of the military offensive, which will take effect
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The NDF abducted Brig. Gen. Victor Obillo, Capt. Eduardo
Montealto, Sgt. Alipio Lozada and Chief Police Insp. Roberto
Bernal in the past month and another military officer last year.
</P>
<P>
When the government suspends military operations against the
rebel group next week, Zamora said, the NDF is expected to start
releasing the hostages.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada ordered the Defense Department Monday
to suspend military operations against the rebels as a
confidence-building measure aimed at facilitating the safe
recovery of the five abducted officers.
</P>
<P>
The NDF has promised to release the hostages between March 22
and April 19.
</P>
<P>
The government's move was in response to the efforts of an
independent third-party humanitarian group led by Archbishop
Fernando Capalla, which negotiated for the release of the
officers.
</P>
<P>
Estrada has indefinitely suspended formal peace talks with the
NDF until the rebels release the five officers unharmed and
without any conditions.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The annual reports of listed
companies on China's two stock exchanges indicate that investment
in the environmental protection industry has brought high profits.
</P>
<P>
The Shenyang Environmental Protection Equipment Co. Ltd., based
in the capital of the northeastern province of Liaoning, gained
255 million yuan in income from its main business operation last
year, up 63.5 percent over 1997.
</P>
<P>
Profits from the operation jumped 68.8 percent to 130 million
yuan, with the profit rate of its main business operations
reaching 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Shenyang municipal government has been
rendering strong support to the company with an annual subsidy of
60 million yuan, allowing corporate profits to more than triple
since 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Chongqing Development Co. Ltd., a real estate company in
the southwestern municipality, purchased a local sewage-treatment
plant last year and generated a yearly profit of 18.5 million yuan,
which accounted for more than 31 percent of the corporation's
total profits.
</P>
<P>
The company projected this year's operational income at 35
million yuan, an increase of 60 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
China is in the process of spending 450 billion yuan on
environmental protection between 1996 and 2000, and the figure
accounts for 1.3 percent of the gross national product and 3.5
percent of the total social fix-asset investment, respectively,
for the period.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, 182 billion yuan will be spent on water-treatment
facilities, 208 billion yuan on the control of air pollution, and
50 billion yuan on solid-waste treatment. This indicates bright
prospects for environment-related industries.

<HEADLINE> China's B-Shares Regaining Vitality: Analysts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Slumping B-shares on China's two
stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen have rebounded by 25
percent after hitting all-time lows early this month.
</P>
<P>
The B-share index closed at 26.80 points on the Shanghai Stock
Exchange on March 23, surging 25.3 percent over the low of 21.24
on March 10, and the Shenzhen B-share index has grown 25.1 percent
since its historic low.
</P>
<P>
B-shares are designed and listed on domestic stock exchanges
for overseas investors only.
</P>
<P>
The bearish B-share markets began in May 1997 with the onset of
the Asian financial crisis. Foreign capital from Hong Kong, Taiwan
and Japan, which accounts for more than 60 percent of all funds in
B-shares, began to withdraw, dragging B-share indexes sharply
downward, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
Xu Lan, of the Nanfang Securities Research Institute, was
quoted by today's China Securities Daily as saying that the B-
shares rebound is not surprising.
</P>
<P>
Xu attributed the better performance to the bullish stock
markets in New York and Hong Kong as well as the rally of H-shares
and red chips, both representing Chinese company interests in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average reached the 10,000 point
milestone on March 16, and the Heng Seng Index in Hong Kong has
climbed over 11,000 points, bringing about overseas-investor
confidence, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the promising performance of B-share
companies and the forthcoming favorable policies governing the B-
share markets from China's securities regulatory authorities have
brought new hope to the declining B-share markets, according to
Liu Zhongxue of the Ping'an Securities Research and Consultation
Company.
</P>
<P>
Analysts also pointed out several difficulties facing the
rejuvenation of B-shares, saying that recovery can not be expected
quickly. The implementation of favorable policies needs time, and
detailed measures are yet to come.
</P>
<P>
In addition, poor liquidity and irregularities in the
disclosure of information concerning stock issuance will be major
hindrances to a resurgent B-share market, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
The securities regulatory authorities have already realized
these problems and solutions of them are now under discussion,
sources said.

<HEADLINE> Rice Supply Stable in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- An adequate stock inventory
coupled with increased distribution activities enabled the
Philippines to keep the supply and price of rice stable during the
first quarter of 1999, the National Food Authority (NFA) said in a
report published Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The NFA said its rice stock stood at 1.1 million tons, or half
of the country's total grains stock, by the end of February.
</P>
<P>
Commercial rice stocks accounted for 16 percent of the total
supply while household rice stocks made up the remaining 35
percent, the NFA said.
</P>
<P>
"With a sufficient beginning stock inventory of rice this year,
the NFA has effectively contributed in assuring the supply and
price stability of the basic staple, particularly for the
January-February period, " it said.
</P>
<P>
The report said the high market visibility of NFA rice has
helped keep the price of rice affordable to ordinary consumers.
</P>
<P>
With the NFA selling its regular-milled rice stocks at 14 peso
(37 U.S. cents) per kilo, retail prices of the staple have
remained as of last month at a per-kilo rate average of 17-18.78
pesos (about 45 U.S. cents), it said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Mayor Puts Letter Box on Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Students in this coastal city in
east China's Shandong Province will warm up this winter as the
local government has vowed to replace all outdated heating
facilities at the city's 65 middle schools with automatic heating
installations.
</P>
<P>
However, most of them may not know of this decision, one of 12
key projects announced recently by the government to be undertaken
this year to further improve the people's working and living
conditions. The project was conceived after a complaint letter
directly addressed to mayor@gov.qd.sd.cn, Mayor Wang Jiarui's e-
mail box, was sent by an ordinary resident, Ze Xuwei.
</P>
<P>
Ze was the first to send an on-line letter to the mayor after
the website was launched on January 18. He said he felt a bit
surprised when he learned of the mayor's timely response to his
complaint.
</P>
<P>
"We had taken it for granted that the city's development is the
affair of policy makers, but this time it really gave me a sense
of participation in public affairs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Like Ze, more than 200 people, including four living abroad,
have posted letters to the mayor through the Internet, and all
have received replies.
</P>
<P>
"It's important to keep our promise to handle every letter
earnestly, or we'll lose the trust of the residents," the mayor
said.
</P>
<P>
Wang, 50, who holds a doctorate in economics, is one of the
first few mayors in China to put his letter box on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the letter box will act as a bridge linking the
government and residents," said the mayor in an on-line letter in
English to all residents on the day his site was launched, adding
that he is looking for more convenient and effective ways to get
to know the local people and enhance decision-making.
</P>
<P>
Most of the messages posted to Wang's letter box deal with
criticism of the government and civil servants, proposals for
improving the work of the government, and complaints about social
problems.
</P>
<P>
Cyber-surfers are usually well-educated, Wang noted, so their
opinions may be more insightful.
</P>
<P>
The mayor has managed to find time every day to go through
these letters and usually gives immediate instructions on how to
respond to them.
</P>
<P>
A special section has been set up in the general office of the
city government to coordinate and supervise the handling of these
letters.
</P>
<P>
The mayor gives great attention to criticism and suggestion
letters focusing on weaknesses in areas such as property
development, the environment, finance, and urban communications.
</P>
<P>
"Such contact has helped make our decision-making more
scientific and democratic," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Information Industry of China,
governments at all levels have been moving toward an increased
presence on the Internet this year in order to enhance government
efficiency. The Beijing Municipal Government has just opened a
similar e-mail letter box on the Internet where Beijingers can
post letters to their mayor on various issues. The Guangzhou and
Shenzhen city governments in south China's Guangdong Province have
also launched trial websites.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou Trust Firm To Be Restructured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou International Trust
and Investment Corporation (Gitic) is expected to carry out a
restructuring plan to help pull out of its present financial
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The initial restructuring plan was announced here over the
weekend at the first creditors meeting on March 18-19 which was
called by this struggling investment arm of Guangzhou, capital of
Guangdong Province in southern China.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the restructuring will provide a way to resolve
Gitic's problems at present, and place it back on a sound
development track in the long run," said Wu Ziyou, deputy director
of the Guangzhou Development Planning Commission which represents
the city government in handling Gitic's affairs.
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman for Price-Waterhouse, the renowned
international accounting firm which has just been invited to
become Gitic's financial adviser, the restructuring aims to create
a financially sound group, and will touch upon Gitic's present
structure, business scope, financial and investment arrangements,
and internal managerial system.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1984, Gitic is the main investment arm of the
city of Guangzhou, and engages in domestic investment, securities
and credit. The bulk of its capital assets are in the Chinese
mainland.
</P>
<P>
Gitic's financial difficulties began to surface late last year
when many of its overseas creditors demanded debt repayment after
the panic triggered by the bankruptcy of the Guangdong
International Trust and Investment Corp., one of the country's
largest trust firms.
</P>
<P>
Poor internal management, rushed investment decisions, and
excessive investment in real estate are believed to be the main
factors responsible for Gitic's current financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Unwilling to see Gitic go bankrupt, the Guangzhou city
government has been making efforts to bail it out. Between March
to August last year, the city government helped raise 3.3 billion
yuan (about 400 million U.S. dollars) for Gitic's use in repaying
part of its foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
Despite the restructuring plan, Gitic remains in the shadow of
a possible bankruptcy due to pressure from its subsidiary firm,
Guangzhou Finance Company LTD (GFC) operating in Hong Kong, which
is besieged by a liquidation demand filed in the local high court
by 11 overseas financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
GFC's liquidation would severely undermine Gitic's
restructuring plan, said Wu Ziyou. "It is very likely that in that
case Gitic would have no way out but to declare bankruptcy."
</P>
<P>
Wu said he hopes these overseas financial institutions will
calm down and voluntarily withdraw the liquidation demand from the
high court.
</P>
<P>
"That will give the people in Guangzhou time to carry out the
rescue plan which will bring about more benefits to creditors than
a liquidation," said Wu.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that Gitic has invited Baker&AMP;Mckenzie to be GFC's
legal consultant.
</P>
<P>
"Both the city government and business circles have placed high
hopes on Gitic's restructuring," said Wu, who called again for
understanding and cooperation on the part of foreign creditors,
urging them not to demand debt repayment or withdraw their
deposits before the restructuring plan is completed and announced.

<HEADLINE> Solana's Order to Bomb Yugoslavia Draw Mixed Reactions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana's order to bomb Yugoslavia has sparked mixed reactions to
the Kosovo crisis which has threatened peace and security in the
Balkans, a traditional power keg in Europe, for over a year.
</P>
<P>
At NATO's headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, Solana told
reporters Tuesday night that he had directed Gen. Wesley Clark,
supreme allied commander in Europe, to initiate air operations in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief did not say when the bombardment will begin, but
it was expected soon.
</P>
<P>
British Defense Secretary George Robertson hinted Tuesday that
NATO would launch air strikes against Yugoslavia on Wednesday
unless Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic accepts a U.S.-backed
plan which had been signed by the Kosovo ethnic Albanians at the
Paris peace talks last week.
</P>
<P>
"If NATO begins air strikes against Yugoslavia on Wednesday, it
will be with a heavy heart," he told the BBC television.
</P>
<P>
However, the latest NATO sabre-sattling threat failed to force
Belgrade into submission, which refused to accept the deployment
of NATO peacekeepers on its territory as envisaged in the U.S.-
backed plan.
</P>
<P>
The Western powers had hoped that the plan could end the
conflict in Kosovo soon. Kosovo is an Albanian-dominated province
in Yugoslavia's Serbian Republic, where the secessionist Albanians
have been fighting for independence since early last year.
</P>
<P>
In Belgrade, Yugoslav Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic on Tuesday
night declared a nationwide state of emergency, the first time
Yugoslavia has declared since World War II.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian parliament voted unanimously on Tuesday to approve
a resolution, rejecting the presence of a NATO-led force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We do not accept any foreign military troops on our territory
under any excuse, at any price, even at a price of bombing,"
Gorica Gajevic, secretary general of Socialist Party (SPS), told
the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Solana's order to strike Yugoslavia received strong support in
Yugoslavia's neighbor, Bulgaria, whose President Petar Stoyanov
said Wednesday morning that Bulgaria will do its best to provide "
humanitarian support" for the NATO action.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian parliament will hold an emergency meeting
Wednesday morning to make a decision on whether to provide an air
corridor for NATO, he said.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the U.S. Senate gave bipartisan support Tuesday
night to President Bill Clinton's decision to launch NATO
airstrikes against Yugoslavia, even as many Republicans expressed
misgivings about the action.
</P>
<P>
However, NATO's possible military intervention in Kosovo was
strongly opposed by a number of countries including Russia and
China, and could deepen the year-long conflict which Western
powers have hoped to end soon.
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov canceled his visit to
Washington Tuesday under the instructions of Russian President
Boris Yeltsin, after being informed of the imminence of NATO
military action in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov warned that if
NATO carries out the threatened air campaign, Russia would be
forced to reconsider its relations with the Western military
alliance and take measures to protect its state interests and
prevent the spread of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov also hinted that Russia could provide military aid to
Yugoslavia in case of NATO air raids. He said NATO military
intervention would seriously damage the U.N. resolution imposing
an arms embargo on Yugoslavia, adding that "any country should
have means of self-protection when being invaded."
</P>
<P>
Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev echoed Ivanov's warning.
Upon his return from India, Sergeyev said NATO air strikes would
lead to "serious consequences" and the conflict could turn into "
another Vietnam War."
</P>
<P>
In the United Nations, China Tuesday voiced its objection to
the use of force against Yugoslavia on the issue of Kosovo, saying
the issue should be solved politically through dialogues.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Permanent Representative to the U.N. Qin Huasun told
reporters that "any military action against the FRY (Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia) without the authorization of the U.N.
Security Council will be a sever violation of the U.N. Charter and
established principles of international law."
</P>
<P>
"Such action will not be accepted by the international
community," Qin said.
</P>
<P>
Russian Permanent Representative to the U.N. Sergey Lavrov said
he would ask for an urgent Security Council meeting if NATO uses
force against Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Chinese People Treasure Sino-U.S. Ties: Chinese Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's
upcoming visit to the United States will strengthen Sino-U.S.
relations, the Chinese Consul General in New York, Qiu Shengyun,
said here Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu will take the opportunity to exchange views on Sino-
U.S. relations and international and regional issues of common
concern and will have wide contacts with people from all walks of
life in the U.S., Qiu said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at a gathering with a group of U.S.
journalists who are members of the New York-based U.S. Overseas
Press Club (OPC).
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu will visit the U.S. next month at the invitation of
U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
It is the first visit by a Chinese premier to the U.S. in 15
years and a follow-up to the exchange of visits by Chinese
President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Clinton in 1997 and 1998,
which helped bring bilateral ties to a new stage.
</P>
<P>
Qiu cited bilateral cooperation in the economic and trade area
as the most tangible results of the development of the
relationship.
</P>
<P>
Two-way trade rose to 54.9 billion U.S. dollars in 1998 from 2.
4 billion dollars in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The United States is now China's second largest trading partner,
while China is the fourth largest trade partner of the U.S.
</P>
<P>
U.S. exports to China support more than 200,000 high-wage high-
tech jobs and many other job opportunities in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is also the second largest investor in China, where 25,
000 U.S. ventures are set up with a contractual value of over 43
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, some people in the U.S. feel unhappy with the
sound development of Sino-U.S. relations by slandering China for "
stealing" U.S. technology.
</P>
<P>
Describing it as groundless, Qiu said restrictions on high-tech
exports to China will only reduce U.S. enterprises' footing in
China's high-tech market, harming U.S. interests in the long-run.
</P>
<P>
About 30 U.S. journalists attended the gathering.
</P>
<P>
The 60-year OPC has some 600 members, currently or previously
assigned to overseas press posts.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Export Restaurants to World Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Export Promotion
Department (EPD) will aggressively promote Thai restaurants to the
international market, with an aim to generate more revenue.
</P>
<P>
Export experts disclosed at a seminar here Wednesday that Thai
export officials have set a four-year target to increase the
numbers of overseas Thai restaurants from 5,000 to 8,000.
</P>
<P>
Starting this year, the department will help potential Thai
food restaurateurs to build a network with foreign investors who
are interested in entering the Thai restaurant business, with the
department acting as a match maker between local operators and
potential foreign partners.
</P>
<P>
Thai overseas restaurants currently generate about 300 billion
baht (8.1 billion U.S. dollars) in revenue for Thailand. The value
is expected to increase by 60 percent if the number of Thai
restaurants meets the four-year target, according to Rachane
Pojjanasunthorn, EPD's deputy director general.
</P>
<P>
"More than 50 percent of the country's revenue is generated
from service industries but most of our human resources are in the
agricultural segment. Therefore, we believe that we can transfer
our people to the service industry since Thais are capable in this
type of business," Rachane said.
</P>
<P>
The department will also conduct an "outgoing mission" by
taking a group of selected Thai restaurateurs to meet potential
partners overseas. At least two or three trips will be organized
annually, with the pilot trip in May to Chicago, Texas, New York
and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
As part of the upcoming mission, the department will regularly
organize seminars with international experts in franchise business
to educate Thai operators.
</P>
<P>
It will also help local operators find suitable locations and
conduct feasibility studies.
</P>
<P>
Rachane said, "Most mature markets like the U.S. and U.K.
already have many restaurants. Moreover, developed countries have
strict and complicated regulations for foreign investors.
Therefore, it would be more convenient to enter the markets of
developing countries."
</P>
<P>
According to the department, there are presently 2,000 Thai
restaurants in the United States and Canada, 700 in Europe, 500 in
Australia and 300 in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 70,000 of Thailand's 150,000 restaurants closed
down.

<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, March 24 (Xinhua)-- Poland has not decided whether or
not it will participate in the NATO military operation against
Yugoslavia, a spokesman from the Polish Defense Ministry announced
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman reaffirmed Poland's stand in support of NATO both
in politics and in actions, and right after NATO Secretary-General
Javior Solana ordered air strikes against Yugoslavia on Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
If NATO decides to use ground troops in Kosovo, Poland can send
its soldiers there, the spokesman said, while predicting only a
slight possibility of that situation ever developing. Poland,
which just became a new NATO member on March 12, had previously
vowed to send a landing battalion to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"The first phase is using the air forces to secure air
superiority," he said. "Only after successful air strikes are
launched can you consider sending land forces in."
</P>
<P>
The 18th land attack battalion is prepared for all possible
fighting and is able to move at any time, said a battalion
official.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Garment Exports Drop 15-20 Percent in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The garment exports of Bangladesh
declined by 15 to 20 percent in January this year compared with
those of the corresponding month in 1998, said Anisur Rahman
Sinha, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufactures and
Exporters Association.
</P>
<P>
Some 800 garments industries in the country had to be closed
down, due to natural disasters, political instability, existing
defective systems in customs and property management, additional
charges by banks and insurance and massive devaluation of
currencies in South Asian countries, he said at a meeting with
U.S. Ambassador to Bangladesh John C. Holzman Tuesday, The
Financial Express daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Figures of garment exports in January were not immediately
available. There are over 3,000 garments and knitwear factories in
Bangladesh, employing around 1 million people and contributing to
about 70 percent of the country's total export earnings.
</P>
<P>
Sinha urged the U.S. government to increase export quota for
Bangladeshi garments. "It is very difficult for Bangladeshi
garment sector to compete in the international markets without the
quota facilities," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also sought support from the Bangladeshi government to help
increase competitiveness of the country's garment sector in the
international market.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Bangladesh would be allowed to export more
than 35 million dozen pieces of apparel products to the United
States and Canada this year under various quota categories,
marking a 10-percent increase over the previous year's figure.
</P>
<P>
The country's garment industry earned approximately 3.8 billion
dollars in the 1997-98 fiscal year ending on June 30, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Tamil Rebels Target Capital Colombo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Tamil rebels are now
targeting the country's capital Colombo to shift attention away
from their jungle hideout in the north of the country, security
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
They said that the rebels, whose strength in the north and east
has been sagging due to several setbacks on the battlefields, are
mobilizing suicide bombers to target individuals and institutions
in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Police have already captured six woman suicide cadres who had
been sent to Colombo together with others for these missions, said
a Defense Ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The public have been cautioned to be on the lookout for
suspicious characters and for objects, parcels and boxes left
unattended in public places.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Colombo was hit by a spate of terrorist
bomb attacks. Police suspect that Tamil rebels had sent bomb
squads to disrupt civilian life in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Security sources estimate that there are only about 1,500 rebel
cadres left and most of them are in the jungles in the north and
east of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry Tuesday announced that government troops
captured 14 villages and the town of Madhu in Northern province
from Tamil rebels in a four-day operation that ended Monday
evening.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, government troops conducted a similar operation
and captured 24 villages from Tamil rebels.
</P>
<P>
Tamil rebels have been waging a war against the Sri Lankan
government for an independent homeland in the north and east of
the country since 1983.

<P>
Khai will visit Japan from March 28 to 30 at the invitation of
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, according to a communique
issued by the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day visit, Khai will discuss with his Japanese
counterpart how to effectively use Japan's assistance and
cooperation and to design a framework for bilateral cooperation
toward the 21st century, Vietnam News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming visit by the Vietnamese prime minister is the
third visit to Japan by Vietnamese leaders with the first by
Vietnam's then prime minister Vo Van Kiet in 1993 and the second
by then general secretary of the Vietnamese Communist Party

<HEADLINE> Paraguay's Vice President Assassinated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Paraguay's Vice President
Luis Maria Argana was shot and killed Tuesday morning in the
center of Asuncion, the capital of Paraguay, according to reports
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The attack occurred at 8:50 a.m. local time. Three men dressed
in military uniforms got out of a vehicle and attacked Argana's
car with grenades and high calibre weapons, including rifles. The
car was transporting the vice president to his office.
</P>
<P>
Argana was hit by four bullets, one of which penetrated his
heart and caused immediate death, according to a preliminary
medical report. The driver and bodyguards were also killed in the
attack.
</P>
<P>
President Raul Cubas has ordered the borders closed during the
search for the killers. He has also summoned an urgent meeting of
the cabinet, including police and military chiefs, to examine the
political situation in Paraguay after Argana's death.
The assassination of the vice president "must be clarified," and
those who are responsible will be brought to justice, Cubas said
in a message to the nation while responding to accusations that he
was responsible for the attack.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Argana have accused Cubas of the attack due to
the political disputes between the two over the release of the ex-
military chief, Lino Cesar Oviedo, who was sentenced to 10 years
in prison last March for an attempted coup against former
President Juan Wasmosy in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Oviedo controversy has split Paraguay's ruling Colorado
Party, causing a rift between factions led by Argana and Cubas.
</P>
<P>
The attack added to political turmoil in Paraguay. In a
political fight, the congress voted 71-37 last Thursday to begin
impeachment proceedings against Cubas, who was accused of abusing
power because of a decree last year that freed his ally and mentor,
former army chief Lono Oviedo.
</P>
<P>
After the assassination of Argana, the interior minister
resigned and was replaced by Carlos Cubas, the president's brother.
</P>
<P>
The governments throughout Latin America condemned the attack
and expressed their condolences for the death of Argana.
</P>
<P>
Both banks and exchange markets suspended their activities in
Paraguay due to the incident. A worker from the vice president's
home was detained, according to a TV broadcasting.

<HEADLINE> Chronology of Major Events Over Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Following is a chronology of
major events over the troubled Yugoslav province of Kosovo since
early this year.
</P>
<P>
January 29 -- The six-nation Contact Group meeting in London
summons the warring Serbs and ethnic Albanians to attend peace
talks in Rambouillet, near Paris, on February 6, in order to end
an 11-month violence in Kosovo. The U.N. Security Council voices
support for the decision to seek negotiated political settlement
of the problem.
</P>
<P>
February 6 -- The peace talks are opened by host French
President Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
February 14 -- The Contact Group extends talks until February
20.
</P>
<P>
February 18 -- NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana threatens
to launch air strikes against Serbian targets if the talks fail.
</P>
<P>
February 20 -- The Contact Group extends the talks until
February 23.
</P>
<P>
February 21 -- Yugoslav army chief General Dragoljub Djdanic
vows to defend Kosovo "at all costs."
</P>
<P>
February 23 -- Major powers say a partial peace agreement is
reached and the two sides will meet again in France on March 15 to
implement the accord.
</P>
<P>
March 15 -- Peace talks resume in Paris. No deadline is given.
</P>
<P>
March 18 -- Kosovo Albanians sign the draft peace agreement on
autonomy in Paris unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
March 19 -- The Contact Group adjourns peace talks, warning
they will not reopen unless Belgrade accepts the autonomy accord.
The breakdown of the peace talks plunges Kosovo into a darker
perspective of bloodshed and war, and increases the risk of NATO
military intervention. Western countries begin to evacuate
diplomatic staffs and their dependents in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
March 20 -- Some 1,400 cease-fire verifiers from the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe withdraw from
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
March 22 -- U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke arrives in Belgrade on
a last-ditch bid to persuade Milosevic to accept the accord.
</P>
<P>
March 23 -- Holbrooke makes no breakthrough after meeting twice
with Milosevic. Solana orders air strikes against Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Agrees to Cut Oil Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Oil ministers of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) agreed here on Tuesday to
cut oil output by 1.7 million barrels a day to boost sagging
prices, announced current OPEC president Yousef Yousfi.
</P>
<P>
Yousfi, also Energy and Mines Minister of Algeria, said he
believes the new cuts will stimulate the oil prices to rise
sharply.
</P>
<P>
He said all the member countries are willing to make
contributions to the efforts.
</P>
<P>
The new cuts will take effect on April 1 and remain effective
for a year. The new output quota will be 22.976 million barrels a
day.
</P>
<P>
Petroleum and Mineral Resources Minister of Saudi Arabia Ali
Ibrahim Naimi said the agreement is "very important," and will be
observed. He expected the average oil price to rise to 18-20
dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is the biggest oil producer in the world, and it
is the first time it agreed to reduce its output to less than
eight million barrels a day since the early 1990's.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Norway, Oman, Mexico and Russia, all non-
OPEC members, said their countries will also take 400,000 barrels
a day off the market to help boost prices.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC members are Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait,
Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and
Venezuela.

<HEADLINE> EU Leaders Meet on Reform, Executive Succession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The leaders of the 15-nation
European Union (EU) gathered here on Wednesday in a bid to reach a
consensus on the bloc's financial reform and EU executive body's
succession.
</P>
<P>
The most important and complicated issue at the two-day summit
is the Agenda 2000 reform package, a program of budgetary changes
aimed at checking costly farm and regional spending to prepare the
union to absorb new members from agriculture-intensive eastern and
central Europe.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, EU farm ministers, through three weeks of
complex negotiations, reached a deal on broad reform of the EU
Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), but failed to achieve radical
cuts in spending.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural support is the biggest element in the EU's annual
budget, and also the union's longest-lasting and most visible sign
of integration.
</P>
<P>
Current EU financial arrangements expire at the end of this
year. Germany, the EU's net contributor of 12.2 billion U.S.
dollars, demands a cut from the EU pay shares.
</P>
<P>
However, EU's southern member states, such as Spain, Portugal,
Greece, as well as Ireland, want to keep their gains from EU
spending at the current levels. France was also strongly opposed
to some German proposals.
</P>
<P>
Analysts hold that Germany needs to make major concessions if
the EU presidency expects achievement on Agenda 2000 at this
summit.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, the leaders will seek means to make up a new
European Commission after the 20 Commissioners resigned last week
for being accused of fraud and nepotism by an independent expert
committee set up by the European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Now, former Italian prime minister Romano Prodi has emerged as
a clear front-runner with the backing of France, Germany, Britain,
Spain and Italy.
</P>
<P>
But German Foreign Minister Joschka Fisher said in Brussels
Monday that the 15 EU leaders would confirm a certain candidate
for the commission presidency at another summit later. The Berlin
summit mainly focuses on how to define procedures, he said.

<HEADLINE> Multilateral Agencies Provide Credits to Yemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) announced on Tuesday that it has approved loans and
credits totaling 64 million U.S. dollars to support Yemen's second
annual program under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (
ESAF) and the Extended Fund Facility (EFF).
</P>
<P>
Of the 64 million dollars, about 49 million dollars are
available under the ESAF, and 15 million dollars are provided
under the EFF.
</P>
<P>
The latest disbursements are from a three-year loan and credit
package totaling 506 million dollars that was approved for Yemen
in October 1997. Of the total, 145 million dollars have been
disbursed.
</P>
<P>
The ESAF is a concessional IMF facility for assisting eligible
members that are undertaking economic reform programs to
strengthen their balance of payments and improve their growth
prospects, while the EFF an IMF financing facility that supports
medium-term programs that seek to overcome balance of payments
difficulties stemming from macroeconomic imbalances and structural
problems.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the World Bank approved a credit of 50 million
dollars for the Public Sector Management Adjustment Project in
Yemen.
</P>
<P>
The IMF said Yemen's economic growth slowed to under 3 percent
in 1998 from 5.6 percent recorded in the previous year and the
external accounts shifted back into deficit as government oil
exports receipts were halved due to the sharp drop in world oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the inflation rate picked up to about 11 percent on
average in 1998, above the target rate of 8.5 percent, spurred
also by the impact of heavy late summer floods on agricultural
prices.
</P>
<P>
Despite the difficult environment, the authorities moved on a
range of structural reforms, including in customs administration,
privatization civil service reform and approval of a modern
banking law, the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF expected Yemen's economic growth rate will rise to 5.3
percent in 1999 while inflation slow to 9.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria to Support NATO on Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sofia, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian President Peter Stoyanov
said early Wednesday morning that his country has no choice but to
support NATO's decision over the current Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The president urged the government, parliament, and all
political forces in Bulgaria to form a common policy of Euro-
Atlantic solidarity, the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Stoyanov made the statement after NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana on Tuesday authorized military strikes against Yugoslavia
as the latter refused to accept a Kosovo deal drafted by the six-
nation Contact Group.
</P>
<P>
He said Bulgaria has not been asked by NATO to provide air
corridors for its possible air strikes against Yugoslavia. Thus,
the army is not on an alert.
</P>
<P>
"I believe there is no need for this now," said the president.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the instability in neighboring Yugoslavia had been
affecting Bulgaria's development, both politically and
economically, for too long, the president said "no one wants more
than the Bulgarians a peaceful and fast settlement to the conflict.
"
</P>
<P>
He did not rule out the possibility to postpone his planned
visit to Germany.
</P>
<P>
Stoyanov urged Bulgarians to stay calm because "there is no
reason to be panic and take unusual action."
</P>
<P>
"What struck me the most in the address of the NATO Secretary
General was the remark that the doors will stay open for a
peaceful outcome," said the president.

"We have time until April 30 to deal with it. After that, we
won't be able to make it," he noted.
</P>
<P>
As most computers use only two digits to store the date, they
are expected to mistake the year 2000 for 1900, creating a system
jam, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We're now talking about replacement, not upgrading. Computers
using Intel Pentium 386, for instance, cannot be upgraded. They
must be replaced," the expert said.
</P>
<P>
"So, we're talking about purchase, delivery and set-up. That's
why April 30 is the deadline," Riyanto said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the critical date of September 9, 1999, when
problems related to the millennium bug are feared to make their
debut, Zuhal said: "We should be careful on that date. Matters
from the public domain are crucial, like Garuda Indonesia Airways.
That should be prioritized."
</P>
<P>
"Other priorities include banking, insurance,
telecommunication, aviation and electricity," he added.
</P>
<P>
To deal with the problem, the minister said, the government has
established a special team.
</P>
<P>
Another information technology expert said efforts to overcome
the Y2K problems must prioritize public safety, money and
credibility sectors.
</P>
<P>
Public safety includes airline and traffic system, finance
including banking, while credibility must include customer service
activities such as billing cycles and systems for utilities as
well as payroll systems, he elaborated.

<HEADLINE> TB Cases Down in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Health Minister Pradip
Nepal said Wednesday that the number of tuberculosis patients in
Nepal has decreased to about 80,000 from some 100,000 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In a message on the occasion of the 117th World Tuberculosis
Day which falls on Wednesday, the minister said the number of
patients dying from tuberculosis has also fallen to about 11,000
from some 16,000.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by the official RSS news agency as saying that 34
percent of tuberculosis patients in Nepal have benefited from the
directly observed treatment short course (DOTS).
</P>
<P>
He said the number of new cases in the country has gone down as
well from about 50,000 to the present 44,000.
</P>
<P>
As the success rate of the DOTS has been more than 85 percent,
the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases has
considered Nepal as a model case in Southeast Asia, the minister
added.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala said in his message that
the DOTS has been introduced to 35 districts in the country and it
will be introduced to the remaining 40 districts in the Ninth

<HEADLINE> Russia Opposes Military Action Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 23 (Xinhua) -- A senior Russian diplomat
on Tuesday night said that his government is opposing the use of
force against Yugoslavia over the issue of Kosovo, saying such an
action, without the authorization of the U.N. Security Council,
violates the principle of the U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
Sergey Lavrov, Russian permanent representative to the United
Nations, told Xinhua at a reception in the Russian Mission that
NATO can not be justified by launching military strikes on
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
There are two instances of use of force under international law,
one instance is for the self-defense and another instance is the
authorization of the U.N. Security Council, he said.
</P>
<P>
For the first instance, "this is not the case," for the second
instance, "this is also not the case," he said.
</P>
<P>
There is no international law providing for the use of force
against any sovereign and independent country simply for the
humanitarian concerns, one of the major factors used by the U.S.-
led NATO to justify its threat of the use of force against
Yugoslavia, he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no international law about the right of the
intervention because of humanitarian considerations," he said, "
Some countries promote this, but this has not yet become law."
</P>
<P>
Russia remains firmly against the military strikes on
Yugoslavia, saying that such an action, without the authorization
of the U.N. Security Council, violates the principle of the U.N.
Charter
</P>
<P>
The 15-member Security Council, under the Charter, has primary
responsibility for the maintenance of peace and security in the
world at large.
</P>
<P>
"Many members of the Security Council and most members of the
United Nations are very much concerned about the possibility of
bypassing the United Nations mechanisms and the United Nations
Charter provisions in the matter of using force," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's dangerous about the very fundamentals of the existing
international system," he said, "Any attempt to use force by
bypassing these mechanisms, I believe, will be detrimental to the
future of the U.N., not for the sake of the U.N., but for the sake
of the collective security system which is embodied in the United
Nations Charter."
</P>
<P>
The Russian envoy made the remarks shortly after NATO Secretary-
General Javier Solana authorized NATO forces to take military
actions against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"If NATO begins to use force against Yugoslavia, I will call a
Security Council meeting to see what other Council members are
thinking about," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council convened several urgent sessions in the
past to discuss the situation in Kosovo at the request of the
Russian Federation.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO threatened Belgrade with force in a bid to
force it into accepting a Western-offered peace plan, but
Yugoslavia said it is ready to enter into negotiations on Kosovo
and reject any imposed ideas on the solution of the problem.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Destroyers Fire Warning Shots at Suspicious Ships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Japanese destroyers fired warning
shots early Wednesday at two suspicious ships discovered in
Japanese waters off Niigata and Ishikawa prefectures on Tuesday,
said the Japanese Defense Agency.
</P>
<P>
But the two ships ignored the shots and orders from the
Japanese destroyers to stop and continued to head north, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese warships took the action after the government
invoked for the first time the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) law's
Article 82, which allows necessary maritime patrol measures by the
country's military.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Maritime Safety Agency (MSA) patrol vessels initially
chased the two suspicious-looking boats on the high seas and later
fired 1,200 warning shots at the ships Tuesday night but failed to
stop them.
</P>
<P>
According to the agency, the two ships were disguised as
fishing vessels and had Japanese names. Their true nation of
origin has yet to be identified.
</P>
<P>
The first of the two vessels was spotted about 45 kilometers
east of Noto Peninsula in Ishikawa Prefecture at about 9:25 a.m.
Tuesday, the MSA said.
</P>
<P>
The second was confirmed at about 1 p.m. after destroyers were
dispatched to intercept the ship, it said.
</P>
<P>
The two roughly 100-ton ships were about 30 meters each in
length. No fishing equipment could be seen on deck.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi on Tuesday set up a task
force to deal with the incident.

<HEADLINE> China to Conduct Air-Fare Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) --China will launch a nationwide
review of air-fare pricing beginning on April 1 in a bid to
maintain normal market order.
</P>
<P>
This campaign, to be carried out by the State Development
Planning Commission (SDPC) and the Civil Aviation Administration
of China (CAAC), will include all airlines and all air-ticket
booking agents.
</P>
<P>
The examination will focus on the random raising and lowering
of prices, lowering the prices by means of changing the selling
date and providing free lodging, excessive selling of tickets at
preferential prices, and boosting commissions in disguised form.
These forms of malpractice are on the rise as a result of money-
losing airlines vying for more passengers amid stiffer competition.
</P>
<P>
Those found to be in serious violation will be fined or have
their business licenses revoked.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Added With More Background Information U.S. Senate Votes to Approve Airstrikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate gave
bipartisan support late Tuesday to President Clinton's decision to
launch North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) airstrikes
against Yugoslavia, even as many Republicans expressed misgivings
about the action.
</P>
<P>
On a vote of 58 to 41, the Senate gave its blessings to an air
campaign ordered earlier in the day by NATO, which appeared to be
imminent.
</P>
<P>
"The case of inaction is unacceptable to the world," said
Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John Warner.
</P>
<P>
The final vote, however, was hardly an overwhelming show of
support. Thirty-eight Republicans and three Democrats opposed the
resolution. Supporting the measure were the remaining 42 of the
Senate's 45 Democrats and 16 Republicans.
</P>
<P>
Told earlier in the day by President Bill Clinton that strikes
against Serbian targets would proceed with or without
congressional support, Senate leaders quickly crafted a bipartisan
resolution of support and shelved earlier plans to call for a vote
on whether to block funds for such an operation.
</P>
<P>
The brief measure states that "the president of the United
States is authorized to conduct military air operations in
cooperation with our NATO allies against the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
While maintaining that he didn't need congressional approval,
Clinton asked for it late in the day, in a letter to congressional
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Some senators suggested the resolution was mostly symbolic,
since Clinton had already decided to launch the strikes.
</P>
<P>
Many Republicans voiced skepticism about the wisdom of
airstrikes and complained that Clinton's consultation with
Congress had come late in the process.
</P>
<P>
"This is a mistake. This is a civil war. We're going to
regret it," said Republican Senator Bob Smith.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House narrowly passed a nonbinding resolution last
week supporting administration policy in trying to end the
violence in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the airstrikes abandoned an effort to try to block
funds for the operations unless Clinton sought congressional
approval first.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Clinton did ask for congressional support late in the
day, sending a letter to House and Senate leaders.
</P>
<P>
Senators, briefed by the president at the White House and later
in the day by members of the president's national security team,
said Clinton told them he had made up his mind and that the
airstrikes were "imminent" and were to begin either late Tuesday
or on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Appeals for Delay of World Table Tennis Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Sweden has pressed for a
postponement of the 45th world table tennis championship whose
prospect was heavily clouded for the lingering Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Ulf Loennqvist, president of the Sweden Table Tennis Federation,
urged on Tuesday the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF)
to postpone the championships in limbo and called for joint
efforts behind its appeal.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came after Germany announced they definitely
decided not send players to compete at the event, which is
scheduled from April 26 to may 9 in Belgrad, Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The world championships are the qualifying tournament for the
2000 Olympic Games so it has to go ahead in some form.
</P>
<P>
The ITTF will meet on Thursday to decide whether they will let
the championships go ahead in the Yugoslav capital if the Kosovo
crisis failed to reach a last-minute resolution.
</P>
<P>
As many as 71 countries and regions have confirmed their
entries until Monday, the deadline for registration, with some
others waiting for the final decision made by the ITTF.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Favor Traditional Chinese Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Border trade has boosted the
export of traditional Chinese medicine to Vietnam in recent years,
the International Business Daily reported yesterday.
</P>
<P>
China now exports a large amount of traditional Chinese
medicine and some 1,000 tons of medicinal materials annually to
its neighbor through the border province of Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
China is expected to add these exports to the list of normal
trade within this year, according to the paper. Vietnam already
considers this trade to be normal, and collects a nine percent
tariff on patent medicines and five percent on imports of
medicinal materials.
</P>
<P>
These medicines are warmly welcomed in south Vietnam where 1.2
million Chinese-Vietnamese live.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's International Medicine Fair, which falls in March,
has been a major channel through which Chinese medicine producers
have been able to export their products to this market, according
to the paper.

<HEADLINE> Six Bulgarian Doctors, Nurses Expected to Be Freed Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Six Bulgarian doctors and nurses,
who were detained for an investigation into the reported AIDS
cases in Libya, are expected to be freed soon, according to a
message from Omar Mustafa al-Muntasser, Secretary for Foreign
Affairs of Libya to Bulgarian Foreign Minister Nadezhda Mihailova.
</P>
<P>
Procedures on the release of these people have been launched,
said the message.
</P>
<P>
The six people, along with their 13 colleagues, were arrested
on February 10, in a hospital in Benghazi, northeastern Libya,
where they were working on an assistance mission. The 13 people
were released last month.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarians' arrest came after cases of the disease were
registered in that hospital. No legal grounds were given for the
arrest but the Libya authorities said they were wanted for
investigation into the AIDS infection.
</P>
<P>
"The arrest was motivated only by concern over the health of
the Libyan residents," the message said.
</P>
<P>
The message stressed that the Libyan authorities are working
in absolute transparency, justice and impartiality, without any
discriminating preconceptions concerning the nationality of the
arrested.
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, Omar Mustafa al-Muntasser voiced his hope that
the two sides will continue to work for the final solution of this
problem and for the promotion of bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Media reports in Sofia have said that these Bulgarians were in
trouble with the Libyan authorities for divulging information of
AIDS cases, whose existence in Libya had been officially denied by
the Libyan government.

<HEADLINE> Primary Schools for Children of Migrant Laborers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's largest city,
has established 140 primary schools for children of the three
million migrant laborers now living in the city, according to a
report in today's Wenhui Daily.
</P>
<P>
The Lubinghua Hope primary school, the first primary school for
these children in Shanghai, now has more than 1,800 students, most
of whom are from neighboring Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
Huang Jiasheng, the school's director, said that he founded the
school in 1993 and it now has 118 faculty members.
</P>
<P>
"Frankly speaking, our classrooms and teaching equipment are
much shabbier than those in regular schools, but we can still
guarantee an education quality," said Wang Jianguo, director of
another such primary school.
</P>
<P>
Many of these schools are now seeking good teachers, and more
than half of the teachers in Lubinghua school have Bachelor's
degrees. The schools also employ some retired experienced teachers.
</P>
<P>
"We want to expand our school system to include middle schools
and try to provide the full nine year's of compulsory education to
the children of migrant laborers," Huang said.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of people, mainly able-bodied laborers in
poor rural areas, have flooded into big cities to seek greener
pastures since China's reform and open-up drive started two
decades ago. How to provide regular education for their children
has become a pressing problem in many cities.

TIRANA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Albania is preparing for any
possible emergency following NATO military action against
Yugoslavia, Albanian Foreign Minister Paskal Milo said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came as Albania's first response to the
imminent strike on Yugoslavia authorized by NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian government convened an urgent session on Solana's

recently to deal with possible emergency brought by fighting and
to defend Albania's sovereignty and territorial integrity, Milo
said.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to Albanian Prime Minister Pandeli Majko, Solana
pledged to guarantee the country's territorial integrity and
sovereignty, Milo added, calling on the people to unite together
and to keep confidence and calm.
</P>
<P>
Albania has recently mobilized ground troops and military
equipment to its northern border with Kosovo for possible NATO
strikes. The government also urged to strengthen air defense
system in the capital and northern cities and to store medicine
and medical supplies for battle use.

11 are authorized to handle overseas tourists. Last year, the city
raked in more than 1.2 billion yuan from tourism.
</P>
<P>
To improve tourism services, the National Tourism
Administration initiated a program selecting the best tourist
cities in 1996. By last year, 54 Chinese cities had been given the

<HEADLINE> Primakov Returns Home on News of Possible Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov canceled a trip to Washington in mid-flight and returned
home because of the deepening crisis in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Primakov stopped off at Ireland's western Shannon Airport
earlier on Tuesday en route to Washington to meet U.S. officials,
but the U.S. later said he had postponed the trip because of
likely NATO military action against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Vice-President Al Gore received the news in a telephone
call with Primakov after the Russian leader had left Shannon for
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Primakov used his brief visit to Ireland earlier on Tuesday to
reiterate Russia's strong opposition to NATO air strikes against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"It (air strikes) defies common sense and could destabilize the
situation in the world. We are categorically against this,
categorically," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, a government spokesman said Primakov postponed his U.
S. visit after Gore told him NATO strikes against Yugoslavia had
become "inevitable."
</P>
<P>
"After a conversation with Al Gore from on board the plane, a
conclusion has been made that the strikes are inevitable. Under
such circumstances, it is impossible to carry out a successful
visit," Andrei Korotokov was quoted saying.

"So the visit has been postponed. The decision has been agreed
between Primakov and President (Boris Yeltsin)," he said, adding
that he expected Primakov to return to Moscow at around 7 a.m.(
0400 GMT) on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a report from on board Primakov's plane, Russia's Itar-Tass
news agency said the prime minister was informed by a Russian
ambassador during his stopover in Ireland that last minute talks
between Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke had collapsed.
</P>
<P>
Primakov was due to attend a regular Washington meeting of an
inter-government commission on economic and scientific cooperation;
he was to co-chair the meeting with Gore. His trip was also seen
as crucial in the government's efforts to win U.S. backing in
talks with the International Monetary Fund on new credits.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev has warned
NATO that air strikes against Yugoslavia could provoke "a new
Vietnam inside Europe."

<HEADLINE> Russia Strongly Opposed to NATO Action Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin is
strongly opposed to NATO military action against Yugoslavia and
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has postponed his visit to
Washington under Yeltsin's instructions, officials said here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Prikhodyko, deputy director of Yeltsin's office, told
reporters that Yeltsin has repeatedly expressed his strong
opposition to any NATO military action against Yugoslavia and he
is now closely following the situation in Kosovo, the Albanian-
dominated province in southern Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Prikhodyko said Yeltsin had written to U.S. President Bill
Clinton Tuesday night on the Kosovo issue. But Prikhodyko did not
give details of Yeltsin's reply.
</P>
<P>
NATO General-Secretary Javier Solana Tuesday ordered airstrikes
against Yugoslavia in Brussels, Belgium a few days after
Yugoslavia's Serbian delegation refused to sign a peace plan at
the Paris peace talks. But he did not say when the bombardment
would begin.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's press secretary Dmitri Yakushkin said Primakov, who
was over the Atlantic on his way to Washington for a regular
Russian-U.S. economic meeting, decided to return home Tuesday
after U.S. Vice President Ale Gore confirmed that NATO air strikes
against Yugoslavia are unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
In their telephone conversations, Gore told Primakov that NATO
bombardment could be conducted during Primakov's visit to
Washington. Primakov is expected to arrive in Moscow early
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Describing NATO's imminent action as a "naked aggression"
against the country, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
underlined Russia's strong objection to NATO military intervention
in Kosovo where the secessionist Albanians have been fighting
Yugoslav security forces for over a year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on an independent television, Ivanov said Russia is
now monitoring the developments in Kosovo and is ready to react
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if NATO carries out its threat, Russia would be
forced to reconsider its relations with NATO and take measures to
protect its state interests and prevent the spread of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said any concrete measures would be determined by
Yeltsin in accordance with the developments in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He said NATO military intervention would seriously damage the U.
N. resolution imposing an arms embargo on Yugoslavia, adding that
"any country should have means of self-defense when being invaded.
"
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said the U.N. resolution was observed by the Yugoslav
side but the Kosovo Albanians have been able to get a large amount
of weapons.
</P>
<P>
Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev echoed Ivanov's warning
against NATO.
</P>
<P>
Upon his return from a visit to India, Sergeyev said NATO
military action in Kosovo would lead to "serious consequences" and
the conflict could turn into "another possible Vietnam War."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that NATO action was a "unilateral act impairing
the rights of a sovereign country and member of the U.N. Security
Council."

<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, March 23 (Xinhua)-- A Cuban court has passed a death
sentence on a Salvadoran man who confessed to a series of hotel
bombings.
</P>
<P>
Under Cuban law, the death sentence of Raul Ernesto Cruz Leon
will be immediately appealed to the Supreme Court, the Communist
Party daily Granma said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The death sentence comes amid a general tightening of security
by the Cuban government, which in recent months has said it feels
under growing attacks by the U.S. government, violent exiles in
Miami, and political dissidents on the island.
</P>
<P>
During Cruz Leon's trial, prosecutors said that heads of the
Miami-based Cuban-American National Foundation recruited and paid
Cruz Leon to plant bombs at six tourist sites. The bombings have
killed an Italian and injured 11 others, including seven
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Cruz Leon was allegedly paid 4,500 U.S. dollars for each
bombing.

WASHINGTON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Pete Sampras was awakened from
the rejoicing of reclaiming the world number one ranking as he was
frustrated Tuesday by nemesis Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands
in the quarter-finals of the Lipton tennis championships.
</P>
<P>
The seventh-seeded Krajicek, took his sixth career victory in
eight matches against the American with a 6-2 , 7-6(8-6) quarter-
final win with his hard service and big shots.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, who ensured his return to the men's throne with a
fourth round win over Spaniard Albert Costa on Monday, has not
reached a final in his four tournaments this year with a record of
7-3.
</P>
<P>
In women's fourth-round action, the former women's No.1 Steffi
Graf of Germany extended her winning streak at Lipton to 21
consecutive matches by beating Belarus' Natasha Zvereva 6-2, 6-4
in the fourth round.
</P>
<P>
Also moving to the quarter-finals was top-seeded Swiss teen
star Martina Hingis, who ended 19-year-old German qualifier
Marlene Weingartner's surprising run with a 6-0, 6-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
South African Amanda Coetzer, seeded ninth, advanced 6-1, 4-2

<HEADLINE> Mexico to Attend OPEC Summit in Vienna as Observer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Mexico is to attend as an
observer the 107th OPEC meeting in Vienna on Wednesday, where
member countries are expected to ratify the proposed cutback of 2.
5 million barrels per day (bpd).
</P>
<P>
A communique from the Mexican Energy Ministry said that Mexico
is to attend this meeting with the aim of participating actively
in their joint effort of oil-producing countries to end the
uncertainty provoked by the instability of the oil prices.
</P>
<P>
On March 12, oil ministers of Saudi Arabia, Iran, Algeria,
Venezuela and Mexico agreed in the Hague to reduce by 2.5 million
bpd in the oil production from April 1.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the producing countries reduced oil production by 3.1
million bpd, a measure which stopped the fall in international
prices which fell to the lowest level in 22 years.
</P>
<P>
It said that the OPEC secretariat invited Mexico as an observer
and as an active participant, in the effort to avoid new falls in
the international market prices.
</P>
<P>
With the participation in the OPEC summit, Mexico's delegation
will request, in the name of the Mexican government, OPEC members
to strengthen their cooperation and stabilize the international
petroleum market.

<HEADLINE> Finland to Close Embassy in Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Finland is to close its embassy
in Belgrade and evacuate its diplomatic staff there in face of
possible NATO air strikes against the federal republic over the
current Kosovo crisis, said a report of the Finnish News Agency
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Pertti Torstila, a senior official of the
Foreign Ministry, as saying that the embassy staff were ordered to
get ready for evacuations early morning on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A weak possibility that the current crisis in the troubled
Serbian province of Kosovo might be eased still exists as Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic maintains phone contacts with
international mediators including U.S. Kosovo envoy Richard
Holbrooke, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke failed his final rounds of a last-minute peace
mission as Belgrade refused to accept a Kosovo peace deal.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana authorized NATO
military forces to launch air strikes against the federal republic,
yet he did not say when the strikes will begin. Yugoslavia, in
return, declared "the state under an immediate threat of war" on
Tuesday night.

<HEADLINE> Serb Parliament Rejects NATO Force for Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Serbian parliament voted
unanimously on Tuesday to approve a resolution, rejecting the
presence of a NATO-led force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Passed by 204 to nil with one abstention, the resolution
strongly condemned NATO's sabre-rattling around the borders of
Yugoslavia, warning if a war was imposed on them, they would
defend themselves against aggressors with all means.
</P>
<P>
"We do not accept any foreign military troops on our territory
under any excuse, at any price, even at a price of bombing,"
Gorica Gajevic, secretary general of Socialist Party (SPS), told
the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The document noted that threat of military strikes by the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization against Yugoslavia was not only no
good to a peaceful settlement to the Kosovo crisis, but also
fanned the fire of separatism and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanian guerrillas in Kosovo, a province of Serbia,
began fighting for independence a year ago, but last week their
political representatives settled for autonomy guaranteed by NATO
troops for an interim three-year period under a plan drafted by
Big Power mediators.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian delegation to the peace talks in France refused to
sign the plan, calling it secessionist and saying NATO troops
would end Belgrade's sovereignty over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of talks between U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade didn't change
the country's stance of rejecting NATO-led force to enter Kosovo.
NATO is now determined to launch air strikes against Yugoslavia.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- China's first research and
development (R&AMP;D) center for returned Chinese students was opened
last Saturday in the coastal city of Yantai, Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
The center will help these scholars start their own business
and carry out their research projects, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The center was set up by 32 returned Chinese students to
conduct research, development, imports and promotion of high
technologies in new materials, bio-engineering and computer and
computerization. The Yantai Development Zone sponsored these
ambitious young people with 2 million yuan (U.S.$240,000) to make
their dreams come true.
</P>
<P>
Ai Fanglin, deputy director of the Overseas Study Service
Center under the Ministry of Education, said, "the state welcomes
students to return to the motherland after they finish their
education abroad and will create favorable conditions for them.
</P>
<P>
According to Ai, over 300,000 young Chinese have gone to study
abroad since China opened its door to the world at the end of the
1970s. About one-third of them have returned home and become key
members of their work units.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, the number of returnees has grown
steadily at an annual rate of 13 percent, said Ai.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Yantai and Shanghai took the lead by establishing
special industrial parks for returned Chinese scholars. By the end
of 1998, more than 23 cities across the country had followed suit,
becoming hosts to over 1,000 enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Latin American Think Tank Against NATO strikes Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Latin American
International Studies Institute (LAIS) said Tuesday that the
Kosovo problem must be resolved by intelligent dialogues between
rival parties of the conflict, instead by threats and expansionist
action.
</P>
<P>
In the communication published here, the non-governmental group,
based in Mexico, claimed that the threat of military action is a
violation of international rights.
</P>
<P>
It said that NATO wants to convert itself into a universal
power, which represents a risk to all the nations of the world,
now that they have the capacity to act at their convenience and
harm international order and equilibrium.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, LAIS gave an alert of a global threat represented by
the militarism pursued by the United States and its European
allies.
</P>
<P>
It said that Washington, with its Pentagon forces as the
forefront troops of NATO, also wish to near Russia, through a
hostile belt which includes the Baltic, Caucasian and Central
Asian countries.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Water-Saving Farming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- China has a pressing need to
develop agriculture which uses water efficiently in a bid to
ensure security of food supplies and alleviate poverty in its vast
arid areas, according to a senior Ministry of Agriculture official.
</P>
<P>
"Half of the country's arable land is afflicted by a water
shortage. Some 43 percent of China's population lives in arid
regions," Vice-Minister Lu Ming was quoted as saying by today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, droughts reduce grain output by 30 million tons a
year, Lu said at a national agricultural conference held over the
weekend in Shaanxi Province, one of the northwest China driest
areas.
</P>
<P>
"Grain production is expected to remain at about 500 million
tons at the end of the century, and reach 800 million tons in the
next 30 years. Arid farm land will play a crucial role in
increasing future output," said Lu.
</P>
<P>
Per capita farm land and forests in the 16 northern provinces
and regions are respectively 1.34 and 1.15 times the country's
average, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Arid land in these areas produces 46 percent of the country's
grain, 61 percent of cotton, 72 percent of soybean, and 46 percent
of edible oil products, said Lu.
</P>
<P>
Poverty always goes hand in hand with aridity and other
difficult natural conditions, Lu said, adding that this has made
it all the more important to develop agriculture in these regions
which uses water efficiently.

<HEADLINE> Helsinki Stress Low Cost in 2006 Winter Olympics Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Helsinki, the Finland's capital,
Tuesday underscored its relatively low cost in hosting the 2006
Winter Games which they are bidding for with Norway.
</P>
<P>
The Finnish bid's promoters presented its details of the 2006
Winter Olympics bid Tuesday, on which the International Olympics
Committee will make its decision in June.
</P>
<P>
Martin Saarikangas, chairman of the bid committee, said that
the plan would cost an estimated 600 million U.S. dollars, of
which 480 U.S. dollars would be covered by broadcasting rights.
</P>
<P>
Helsinki will co-host with Norway with the venues split between
three cities including indoor events in Helsinki, cross-country
skiing in Lahti, Finland, and Alpine skiing in Lillehammer, Norway,
the site of the highly regarded 1994 games.
</P>
<P>
"We hardly need to build anything. It's all there,''
Saarikangas said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
"Helsinki would have to build an athletes' village and a
skating arena," he added.
</P>
<P>
Also in the running are the Italian city of Turin, Sion,
Switzerland; Klangenfurt, Austria; Poprad-Tatry, Slovakia; and
Zakopane, Poland.

<HEADLINE> Diesel-Powered Automobiles Encouraged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- China is encouraging diesel-
powered vehicles in a bid to save fossil-fuel resources and lower
auto-exhaust emissions.
</P>
<P>
Experts say diesel vehicles provide better fuel economy and
discharge lower amounts of hydrocarbon and carbon-monoxide
emissions than gasoline vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Du Fangci, a researcher with the State Administration of
Machinery Industry, said that the "state regulatory authorities
are in the position to promote development of high-performance and
lower-emission diesel vehicles" through setting standards and
enhancing management.
</P>
<P>
"It is a step in the right direction for China's automakers to
develop diesel vehicles," Du was quoted by China Daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration of Quality and Technical Supervision
has recently tightened standards concerning vehicle exhaust
emissions. To come into effect on January 1, 2000, they also cover
diesel-powered vehicles.
</P>
<P>
But currently in cities like Lanzhou, Urumqi and Xiamen, local
regulations prevent diesel-powered light commercial vehicles such
as "Transit," "Iveco" and some trucks from entering these cities,
since they are believed to be a major source of air pollution.
</P>
<P>
The annual output of diesel vehicles in China has been about
400,000 during the past few years, most of which were heavy-duty
trucks and buses, accounting for less than 30 percent of total
vehicle production.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Aviation Industries of China
(Avic), backbone of China's aircraft manufacturing industry, is
undergoing major restructuring and will be split into two groups
in the near future, today's China Daily said.
</P>
<P>
The news was released by a senior official of Avic at an
international seminar on aero engine technology held yesterday in
Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
"The restructuring move will not have any impact on our
operation with foreign partners, which will be strengthened and
developed further," said Yang Jiming, vice-director of the aero
engine bureau under Avic.
</P>
<P>
Phil Ruffles, director of engineering and technology at Rolls-
Royce, said ," This is the second event of what we hope will be a
continuing and developing series of seminars which will strengthen
and develop Rolls-Royce's existing collaboration with China in the
field of turbine technology."
</P>
<P>
The two-day symposium was jointly held by Avic, Rolls-Royce plc
and BMW Rolls-Royce.
</P>
<P>
During the symposium, Rolls-Royce signed an agreement
concerning a collaborative titanium research program with Beijing
Institute of Aeronautical Materials, developing processing methods
for non-burning titanium alloys. The first phase of the program
will last three years.

<HEADLINE> WB Loan Helps Rehabilitate Quake-Hit Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The reconstruction program in
Lijiang, an ancient southwest China town damaged by a strong
earthquake three years, has been completed with the help of an
emergency World Bank loan.
</P>
<P>
Local officials announced recently that more than 400
reconstruction projects have been completed.
</P>
<P>
A strong quake measuring seven degrees on the Richter scale
devastated Lijiang and surrounding areas in Yunnan Province on
February 3, 1996. The quake caused direct economic losses of over
four billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Lijiang is known for its unique cultural heritage, especially
its ancient and unique buildings. The World Bank provided
emergency assistance loans totaling 348.6 million yuan, with the
Chinese government providing an additional 177 million yuan for
the reconstruction effort.
</P>
<P>
Some 600 million yuan had been invested in the reconstruction
program by the end of 1998. The World Bank loans were mainly used
for rehabilitating 2,000 houses, four water plants, six hospitals,
15 middle schools and 35 primary schools, as well as a number of
ancient relics.
</P>
<P>
The project has enabled 30,000 local youngsters to continue
their education.
</P>
<P>
World Bank officials have expressed great satisfaction with
Lijiang's success and local officials have been invited to recount
their experiences during a bank meeting scheduled for Rome in
October.

<P>
BELGRADE, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Prime Minister Momir
Bulatovic declared "the state under an immediate threat of war" on
Tuesday night with NATO poised to launch air strikes against the
country over the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
Bulatovic read the declaration on state television. He said the
decision had been taken because of repeated "threats of aggression
" by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
"After consultation with the Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and the speaker of the lower house of the Yugoslav
parliament Milomir Minic," the government made the decision in
line with the constitution, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time Yugoslavia has declared a nationwide state
of emergency since World War II.
</P>
<P>
The government ordered the measure after President Milosevic
refused to accept a Kosovo peace deal, which the ethnic Albanians
had signed in Paris, France, last week. The statement came after
the final rounds of a "last-minute peace mission" with U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke failed to reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and NATO have confirmed the threat of military strikes
against Yugoslavia. On Tuesday, NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana authorized NATO military forces to launch air strikes
against the federal republic.
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief advised reporters in the Brussels-based NATO
headquarters of the final authorization, but he did not say when
the military action will begin.

<HEADLINE> NATO Chief Orders Airstrikes Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 23 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana Tuesday ordered airstrikes against Yugoslavia, saying all
efforts for a negotiated solution to the Kosovo crisis had
failed, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
"All efforts to achieve a negotiated, political solution to
the Kosovo crisis having failed, no alternative is open but to
take military action," Solana told reporters at the headquarters
of the Western alliance in Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
"We deeply regret that these efforts did not succeed, due
entirely to the intransigence of the (Yugoslav) government," he
said. "This military action is intended to support the political
aims of the international community."
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief said athe attacks would be directed at weakening
the Serb army and special police forces and reducing their ability
to cause humanitarian catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
"NATO is not waging war against Yugoslavia," Solana said. He
added that the door remains open to the Yugoslav government to
show at any time that it is ready to meet the demands of the
international community.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the Kosovo Albanians to remain committed to the
peace agreement they signed in Paris last week and called on the
Kosovo Liberation Army to refrain from provocative military
action.
</P>
<P>
"Our objective is to prevent more human suffering and more
repression and violence against the civilian population of
Kosovo," the secretary-general said.

<HEADLINE> Keegan Gives Owen Fitness Ultimatum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- England wonderkid Michael Owen has
been given until Thursday to prove his fitness for the Euro 2000
qualifier against Poland by England coach Kevin Keegan on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We want him fit but if he's not involved in training at
Wembley on Thursday, I personally would be loath to play him on
Saturday," said Keegan.
</P>
<P>
The new manager's preparations for the match have already been
disrupted by a number of players suffering from niggling injuries
and the withdrawal of David Batty.
</P>
<P>
The Leeds midfielder is suffering from a chest infection and
his absence leaves the England squad in serious need of back-up as
they prepare for a game in which victory is a prerequisite.
</P>
<P>
The absence of Batty, who had been expected to partner Jamie
Redknapp in central midfield, is especially worrying given that
Paul Ince is suspended and Nicky Butt is injured.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Leeds player's absence is likely to improve the
chances of Tim Sherwood or Ray Parlour winning a first cap, but
Keegan may well decide to call on his former Newcastle captain
Robert Lee or even West Ham midfielder Frank Lampard for more
reinforcement.
</P>
<P>
Defender Andy Hinchcliffe was also added to Keegan's injury
list after he was ruled out of Saturday's game at Wembley with a
back injury.
</P>
<P>
The absence of the Sheffield Wednesday full-back leaves Graeme
Le Saux and Phil Neville vying for the left-back spot.
</P>
<P>
Robbie Fowler and Darren Anderton were also missing when
England trained at Bisham Abbey on Tuesday although Keegan has yet
to confirm whether they are carrying injuries.
</P>
<P>
The former Newcastle boss has already been sweating on the
fitness of Chris Sutton (groin), David Seaman (shoulder) and Nigel
Martyn (back) and none of the quartet took part in this morning's
session at Bisham Abbey.
</P>
<P>
If Seaman and Martyn fail to improve before Saturday, Keegan
will have to put his faith in Ian Walker - a last minute call-up
to provide the final line of defence.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial average
fell sharply Tuesday in fears by investors about lower company
earnings and higher bond interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Dow closed down 218.68 or 2.2 percent at 9,671.83, losing
momentum for closing above 10,000. The index crossed the five
digit milestone several times last week in intraday trading.
</P>
<P>
The blue chip stocks got the second-worst point loss this year
and sank below 9,700 for the first time since March 9.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were even lower than the Dow. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 34.87 or 2.7 percent at
1,262.14 and the technology heavy Nasdaq index was down 73.10 or
3.1 percent at 2,322.84.
</P>
<P>
Fears spread among investors after Merrill Lynch said the
Coca-Cola company would reduce its sales growth because of
economic crises in Latin America and Japan. Investors had got
uneasy about earnings of technology companies such as Dell
Computer and IBM.
</P>
<P>
Investors were also worried about bond interest rates. The
30-year Treasury bond yield was down to 5.56 percent Tuesday, but
still above 5.5 percent, the level which would disturb both the
stock and bond markets.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 15.04 to 595.45 and the American Stock
Exchange index fell 14.04 to 703.32. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies fell 9.83 to 383.37.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-2 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 675 up, 2,360 down and 504
unchanged.

NYSE volume increased to 808.66 million shares from 656.21

HANGZHOU, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The industrial sector of east
China's Zhejiang Province has started 1999 on a strong note,
official figures show.
</P>
<P>
State-owned enterprises and non-state firms with annual sales
of more than five million yuan each generated a total of 66.72
billion yuan in output value in the first two months of this year,
up 18.9 percent over the same period of last year. The growth rate
is 7.3 percentage points higher than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises reported 4.78 billion yuan in profits and taxes
in January and February, a year-on-year jump of 36.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang's two-month exports rose 15.2 percent to 1.53 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The improved performance of the industrial enterprises as a
whole in this economically developed province is attributed to the
central government policies to increase domestic demand, which
help accelerate structural reform in the industrial sector.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Outlines 1st Phase of Attack Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- NATO would bring a barrage of
U.S. cruise missiles from Navy ships and submarines and Air Force
bombers aimed at "blinding" Yusoslavia's extensive network of air
defense radars and missiles in its first phase of attacks, U.S.
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We will take very seriously the threat posed by this air
defense system and do our best to suppress that, as well as
looking at other targets," Pentagon spokesman Ken. Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
Once the air defenses had been damaged, a variety of manned
aircraft, including U.S. and allied F-16s and American F-15s,
would have a less risky opportunity to target weapon depots and
Serb troop concentrations, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. officials declined to discuss a timetable for
beginning the attacks but indicated they were imminent.
</P>
<P>
In a further sign that NATO action was approaching, Bacon said
Yugoslav military officers who had been stationed at a NATO air
operations center in Italy since last year as part of an exchange
agreement were being sent home.
</P>
<P>
One factor being weighed by allied military officials was the
poor weather forecast for Yugoslavia Wednesday, which would not be
a problem for cruise missiles but would hamper efforts to assess
bomb damage.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Fifth Committee
(Administrative and Budgetary) of the United Nations Tuesday
approved a draft decision by which the General Assembly would
allow seven states to retain voting rights despite their level of
accumulated unpaid assessed contribution.
</P>
<P>
By the terms of the draft, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cambodia and
Georgia would retain their voting rights through June 30, 1999,
and the Republic of the Congo, Guinea-Bissau, Honduras and
Nicaragua would be able to vote through June 30, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The decision was based on recommendations from a special
session of the Committee on Contributions, the body that
considers requests for exemption to Article 19 of the United
Nations Charter, by which member states are stripped of their
voting rights when the level of their arrears equals or exceeds
two years' assessed contributions.
</P>
<P>
It recommends approval of such requests when it determines
that failure to pay is beyond a state's control.

WASHINGTON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov abruptly postponed a planned trip to Washington Tuesday
after he was briefed by U.S. Vice President Al Gore on
unsuccessful diplomatic efforts to resolve the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Russia has steadfastly opposed threatened NATO airstrikes
against Serb targets in the province.
</P>
<P>
"After discussing the worsening situation in Kosovo, Prime
Minister Primakov decided to return to Moscow," Gore said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
During a refueling stop in Shannon, Ireland, before the trip
was postponed, Primakov made clear his country's opposition to a
NATO attack.
</P>
<P>
"It is against good sense. We are firmly against this,"
Primakov said while speaking through a translator.
</P>
<P>
Gore and Primakov were planning to discuss increased economic
and technical cooperation between the two nations. Primakov also
was scheduled to meet with U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. government official said Gore had spoken twice with
Primakov Tuesday, and described the tone of the conversations as
businesslike.
</P>
<P>
"The vice president was very firm," said the official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity. "The vice president could not
assure Primakov that bombing would not take place while he was
here" in Washington.

<HEADLINE> Britain Pledges Racist Reform After Lawrence Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- British Home Secretary Jack Straw
Tuesday promised new measures to combat racism in the wake of the
inquiry into the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
Straw, setting out the government's point-by-point response to
the Lawrence report, said his plan of action should bring about
"real, practical change."
</P>
<P>
The report was commissioned to investigate the police handling
of the inquiry into the death of 18-year-old Stephen Lawrence who
was fatally stabbed by white youths at a bus stop in south-east
London in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The new measures would focus on tackling "institutionalized
racism" in the police service, with a shake up of training and
procedures.
</P>
<P>
But Straw warned that the government had "serious reservations"
about proposals to allow prosecutions for racist offenses which
take place in private.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that changes to the double jeopardy principle,
whereby a defendant could not be tried for the same offense twice,
would be considered without any firm prospect of action.
</P>
<P>
The action plan aims to bring the police fully within the remit
of the Race Relations Act and states that all aspects of policing
will be covered by forthcoming Freedom of Information laws.
</P>
<P>
Straw said he would lead a steering group including members
from the Commission for Racial Equality, the Black Police
Association, the Metropolitan Police and other police
organizations and the Crown Prosecution Service to enact most of
the recommendations.
</P>
<P>
"We recognize that action to tackle racism must begin at the
earliest stage and be carried out across all agencies," he said.

<HEADLINE> Blue-Green Algae Has Dual Cholesterol Lowering Abilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. scientists say they have
confirmed for the first time that blue-green algae taken as a
nutritional supplement can significantly lower cholesterol in
animals, and further more the algae works in two ways to reduce
cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
Speaking Monday at a national meeting of the American Chemical
Society in Anaheim, California, Christian Drapeat of Cell Tech in
Klamath Falls, Oregon, said that the alga Aphanizomenon flos-aquae
(AFA) is a new dietary supplement already available on the market.
</P>
<P>
It contains significant amounts of polyunsaturated fatty
acids (PUFAs), which seem to be exceptionally well absorbed by
animals.
</P>
<P>
Other research over the past decade has suggested that PUFAs
could reduce blood cholesterol and deficiency of PUFA is linked
with cardiovascular disease, chronic fatigue syndrome, certain
forms of cancer, attention deficit disorder and more.
</P>
<P>
Apart from providing PUFAs, AFA's cholesterol-lowering effects
are likely to mediated by something else which is unknown
currently, said Drapeat.
</P>
<P>
For the time being scientists are studying if the effects of
AFA on cholesterol in rats will translate to humans.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 23 (Xinhua) -- There is almost no chance for a
peaceful solution of the Kosovo crisis, the German government
announced Tuesday while the German Defense Ministry finished
preparing for coming air strikes.
</P>
<P>
"It seems that the Holbrooke mission is fruitless, and it's not
the fault of Holbrooke's negotiating talent, but because of the
irresponsible and inacceptable line of Milosvic," German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said at an executive session of the
ruling Social Democratic Party (SPD).
</P>
<P>
U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke returned to headquarters
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in Brussels
Tuesday after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic rejected his
peaceful bill.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder told SPD leaders that NATO would take strike actions
as planned. "We will do this until Milosevic comes back to the
basis of humanity and international law," he said.
</P>
<P>
The German Defense Ministry said that the German air force
Luftwaffe had been "fully prepared" for NATO air strikes, and up
to 15 Tornado fighters with 500 soldiers would take part in one
turn of attack against Yugoslav targets.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Defense Ministry said it was "absolutely
necessary" for the government to put Tornado fighters in action
from the very beginning of air strikes, because the fighter was
able to evade surface-to-air missiles.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Supports Local Government in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank Tuesday
approved a loan of 100 million U.S. dollars for the local
government finance and development project in the Philippines,
aimed at improving the capacity and strengthening the capability
of the local government units.
</P>
<P>
The project's main objective is to assist participating local
government units in expanding and upgrading their basic
infrastructure, services, and facilities; and in strengthening
their capacities in municipal governance, investment planning,
revenue generation, and project development and implementation,
the bank said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The project reinforces the bank's long-standing commitment to
strengthen fiscal decentralization and local self-reliance in the
Philippines," said Thomas Zearley, principal operations officer in
the World Bank East Asia and Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the project is consistent with the Philippine
government's objectives of strengthening public policies and
implementation capabilities; improving the country's
infrastructure and facilitating growth, particularly by mobilizing
private investment and participation; and alleviating poverty and
upgrading basic social services.
</P>
<P>
Total costs of the project are 133.7 million dollars. The World
Bank's loan of 100 million dollars is at the bank's standard
interest rate for LIBOR-based U.S. dollars single-currency loans,
with a maturity of 20 years, including a five-year grace period.
The balance of 33.7 million dollars will be provided by the
Philippine government.

BELGRADE, March 23 (Xinhua) -- United States special envoy
Richard Holbrooke ended his two-day emergency talks with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic and headed for NATO headquarters in
Brussels on Tuesday.
</P>

The American diplomat said before departing that his "tortuous"
talks with the Yugoslav president did not achieve much.

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke Ends Emergency Talks, Heads for NATO HQ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Holbrooke, who came here on Monday after a stopover in
Brussels, held a four-hour talk with President Milosevic and
discussed with the presidential security thinktank in Washington
over phone the rest of the night.
</P>
<P>
He told the press before leaving Belgrade that he conducted two
days of intense talks with President Milosevic and his associates.
"We emphasized two things: we see an evidence that there would be
a cease-fire of the military operations going on in Kosovo; the
readiness to enter into prompt actions that will lead rapidly to a
NATO-led force in Kosovo in accordance with the Rambouillet
accords."
</P>
<P>
He described the talks as very intense and tortured between the
Contact Group, western countries and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The American envoy, who brokered last October cease-fire
agreement, said that the NATO-led force would neither be pro nor
anti any ethnic group in the Yugoslav province but favor only the
peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Though President Milosevic said repeatedly that his side would
not agree to the NATO-led peace implementation force, Holbrooke
said that he could not see any amendments forthcoming even after
consultation with U.S. President Bill Clinton and U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke's team was instructed by Washington to go to Brussels
and meet with the NATO allies before returning to Washington.
</P>
<P>
The American diplomat said that it would be misleading to
define his talks as having made any positive movement.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the end of his talks with the Yugoslav
president meant a status of war had been established, the American
special envoy said that this was not in his ken to answer.
</P>
<P>
He added that the president in the White House was the one to
answer that question.
</P>
<P>
But Holbrooke stressed that communications are always open,
even in times of conflict and that international mediator
Christopher Hill would return to Skopje in neighboring Macedonia
and Belgrade has his telephone number there.
</P>
<P>
He declined to say whether it would be his last diplomatic
effort but that the question had to be dealt with by others.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo observers here tended to believe that Holbrooke had had
something from his talks this time with President Milosevic but
that the thing may be difficult for NATO to accept before
rendering it possible to make the current face-off soften somehow.
</P>
<P>
Last October it was through Holbrooke's shuttle activities
between Belgrade and Brussels that finally led to the cease-fire
agreement and the deployment in the Yugoslav province of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe-led Kosovo
Verification Mission.

<HEADLINE> African Countries Urged to Protect Traditional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 23 (Xinhua) -- African countries should avoid
enacting legislation under the segregative Trade Intellectual
Property Rights Agreement, an expert said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Johnson Epkere, scientific research consultant with the
Organization of Africa Unity (OAU), said the agreement did not
recognize the rights of African communities to traditional and
indigenous knowledge.
</P>
<P>
Epkere said this on the second day of the southern African
regional workshop on the Intellectual Property Rights here in the
Zimbabwean capital.
</P>
<P>
If African countries rushed to implement the agreement, he
said, it would lead to unjustified exploitation of their knowledge
and biological resources by foreign corporations.
</P>
<P>
"African countries should develop suitable legal systems of
protecting their own plant varieties, indigenous knowledge and
technologies and community rights consistent with national
priorities," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was important for African governments to be wary of threats
that were posed by multi-national corporations and unethical
science and technical research teams from western countries, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Only Egypt, South Africa and Zimbabwe had legal instruments to
comply with the agreement because their existing laws protected a
number of plant varieties, he said.

HARARE, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's 11 rose growers who
export flowers into Europe have been accredited to the
International Flower Label Program, a pilot project which
guarantees cut flowers produced under socially and environmentally
sustainable conditions.
</P>
<P>
Spokesperson of the Zimbabwean Flower Growers Association
Pauline Alexander Tuesday told the Zimbabwe News Agency Ziana that
the Zimbabwean farmers were the second to be granted such
recognition after Ecuador.

The International Flower Label Program sets out criteria for
cut flower production.
</P>
<P>
"This includes the safe use of pesticides, worker protection,
strict registration procedures of spraying programs, re-entry
intervals, protective clothing, staff training courses, blood
analyses and strict environmental protection," Alexander said.
</P>
<P>
Horticultural Promotions Council director Stanley Heri said,
"having established ourselves as a producer of quality flowers, it
was essential to maintain that reputation and improve on it."
</P>
<P>
Another country participating in the Flower Label Program was
Kenya, while growers in Zambia, India and Israel had expressed
interest to join, Alexander said.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Praises PNA for Thwarting Terrorist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu Tuesday praised the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
for helping thwart a terrorist attack against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Tel-Aviv after a three-day visit to
Ukraine, Russia and Georgia, Netanyahu called the PNA's help "a
positive step."
</P>
<P>
But he said the PNA was not operating systematically against
terrorism, claiming that other killers of Jews were being freed by
the PNA after they were detained.
</P>
<P>
About three weeks ago, the PNA uncovered a plan of the Islamic
militant group Hamas to launch an attack in central Israel, and
passed the information on to the Israeli security forces.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel Radio said that a wide-scale manhunt was
underway for a Hamas member, Mahmoud Abu Hunoud, who was
suspected of planning the attack.
</P>
<P>
The radio said that Abu Hunoud might have received the orders
and cash payments from overseas Hamas leadership to carry out the
attack in the coming days. But his plan was foiled by Israeli and
Palestinian security forces.
</P>
<P>
Abu Hunoud, who has been at large since 1994, was also
suspected of involvement in several suicide bombing attacks in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Early Monday, Israeli security forces raided the house of Abu
Hunoud near the West Bank city of Nabulus and detained his father
and some other relatives.
</P>
<P>
Hamas, which rejects the peace agreements between Israel and
the PNA, has carried out since 1994 several terrorist attacks that
resulted in the deaths of scores of Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Last October, the PNA and Israel signed a land-for-peace
agreement in the United States, under which the PNA should take
tougher measures against terrorism in return for the further
withdrawal of Israeli troops from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
But Israel suspended the implementation of the agreement in
December, accusing the PNA of not fulfilling its commitments.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security sources said the recent cooperation between
Israeli and Palestinian security forces suggested that the PNA was
making efforts to prevent any terrorist attack against Israel
before the May elections in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that by helping Israel, the PNA wanted to
convince the U.S. and European countries that it had fulfilled its
part of the commitments under the peace pact.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, a brother of a top Palestinian
security official was charged by an Israeli military court
Tuesday with recruiting members for Hamas.
</P>
<P>
The defendant, Yasser Rajoub, is a brother of Jibril Rajoub,
head of PNA's Preventive Security Services in the West Bank.

NEW YORK, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Internet penetration is
projected to rise to one third of U.S. households by the end of
1999 and close to two thirds by the end of 2003, from the current
25 percent level, a U.S. research firm reported on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Urges Israel to Implement All Peace Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Palestinian
Leader Yasser Arafat on Tuesday urged Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to honest and implement all peace agreements
completely.
</P>
<P>
The move came after Arafat met with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan this morning. It was widely seen here that Arafat, who has
said he might declare a Palestinian state on May 4, 1999, was seeking
consultation from the United Nations on what should happen on and
after May 4.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, Arafat said his talks with the U.N.
chief was positive and constructive, and Annan voiced his support
for all the U.N. resolutions on the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said he was sorry that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu had frozen all negotiations and meetings on the peace
process in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Under an interim peace agreement signed in Cairo in May 1994,
Israel and the Palestinians were to have completed talks on the
final status of the Palestinian territories by May this year.
Those negotiations have hardly started.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is under pressure from the U.S. congress and the Clinton
administration to postpone a unilateral declaration of statehood
on May 4.

<HEADLINE> Garten Says U.S. Benefits by Getting China into WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Blocking China from the World
Trade Organization would be a serious mistake for it would
undercut U.S. commercial and security interests, Jeffrey E. Garten
said in his article entitled "The Wrong Way to Punish Beijing",
published in the New York Times Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"As the rage over China's alleged theft of American nuclear
secrets continues to seethe in Washington, Congress will be
looking for ways to punish Beijing," said Garten, the former under
secretary of Commerce for International Trade in the first Clinton
Administration. "The obvious move would be to deny China" entry
into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Garten, now dean of the Yale School of Management, pointed out
that U.S. would "benefit if China sticks to a path of economic
reform,and the WTO provides powerful reinforcement for Beijing to
do so". "By becoming a member of the WTO, China would in effect be
signing a treaty committing itself to becoming a market economy,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
He also said that joining the WTO would "force China to open
its markets, American industry, agriculture and banking would gain
great advantages".
</P>
<P>
"China's membership in the WTO would support our national
security too", he continued. "Surely we have a better chance of
seeing a peaceful and prosperous China if it is inside the WTO
tent, adhering to the rule of law, rather than outside of it."

<HEADLINE> Egypt Helps Finance Uganda's Hyacinth Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian government has given
Uganda a grant of 18 billion shillings (18 million U.S. dollars)
to help control water hyacinth in water bodies of the country.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Specioza Kazibwe, who arrived in Cairo Sunday,
will sign the agreement during her current visit to Egypt,
Tuesday's New Vision newspaper quoted a press release from her
office as saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
The press release said that Egyptian Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister of Agriculture and Land Reclamation Youssef Wali was
deeply impressed by Uganda's speed in handling the joint program
to control the water weed.
</P>
<P>
Egypt will also help Uganda with irrigation and water
management besides training Ugandans in biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
Last year a team of Egyptian experts came to help Uganda solve
the water hyacinth problem. Countries drinking water from the Lake
Victoria have resolved to rid the lake of the water hyacinth which
causes environmental problems and a lot of inconvenience for
people's lives.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government has used chemical, physical, biological
and mechanical methods to remove this prolific plant. But water
hyacinth is still found on water surface because it floats and its
removal can cost more than the country can afford.

<HEADLINE> UPOV Welcomes China's Accession to Plants Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The head of the International Union
for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV) has welcomed
China's accession to the organization.
</P>
<P>
By depositing its instrument of accession to the International
Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants here Tuesday,
China will become the 39th member of UPOV on April 23.
</P>
<P>
Kamil Idris, Secretary General of UPOV and Director General of the
World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), said that by
protecting the rights of plant breeders, the membership of the
People's Republic of China would contribute to promoting agricultural
development and ensuring food security.
</P>
<P>
UPOV, an intergovernmental organization based in Geneva, cooperates
in administrative matters with WIPO.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the UPOV convention is to acknowledge the
achievements of breeders of new plant varieties by granting them an
exclusive property right on the basis of a set of uniform and clearly
defined principles.
</P>
<P>
To be eligible for protection, varieties have to meet certain
conditions such as being distinct from existing, commonly known
varieties and sufficiently homogeneous and stable.
</P>
<P>
Protection is given to plant breeders both as an incentive to the
development of agriculture, horticulture and forestry, and to
safeguard the interests of plant breeders. Improved varieties are a
necessary and cost-effective ingredient for achieving food security in
a sustainable way.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Bans Fish Exports to Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ban took effect Monday and will last until appropriate
measures are in place to protect consumers, the New Vision paper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
An official with Uganda National Bureau of Standards was quoted
as saying that the bureau had instructed fish processors not to
export fish to the European market because they could not
guarantee the quality of fish products.
</P>
<P>
Up to now at least five people including two children have died
of eating poisoned fish and dozens of fishermen using this method
to catch fish have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
A one-month ban on fish sale has been enacted at markets in
Kampala and Entebbe to ensure the poisoned fish do not
proliferate. Meanwhile, price of meat has soared up due to this
ban.
</P>
<P>
Europe is the largest market for Uganda's fish products.
Exports to Europe plummeted due to a ban on fish exports imposed
in December of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The value of fish exports dropped by 11.6 percent from 34.6
million U.S. dollars in 1996/1997 fiscal year to 31 million
dollars in the next fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Interdict Incompetent Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has directed Minister of Public Services Amanya Mushega to
interdict officials who are named in the parliamentary select
committee report as having been responsible for mismanagement of
the livestock project.
</P>
<P>
The president's directive was contained in a statement
presented to Parliament Tuesday by the Minister of Presidency
Ruhakana Rugunda on the report of the select committee on
agriculture, Radio Uganda reported Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The officials to be interdicted include former Permanent
Secretary Opika Opoka and other senior officials in the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Museveni also directed investigations to establish whether a
project consultant used money from the livestock services to build
his private school.
</P>
<P>
The president has noted that the main problem with government
projects is poor conception and design. That is why there are
consequential problems during implementation.
</P>
<P>
Museveni also thanked the select committee for the work it has
done and said that the executive and the legislature have a
complementary role in improving the management of public affairs
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The 100-page report by the select committee holds that Vice
President Specioza Kazibwe, who is also the Minister of
Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries, and two state
ministers in her ministry should take political responsibility for
shoddy work done in the construction of all the 15 valley dams.
</P>
<P>
The mismanagement of the valley dam project is alleged to have
made the government lose 3.4 million U.S. dollars. Many MPs demand
to censure Kazibwe for that.
</P>
<P>
However, Rugunda said that Kazibwe is currently on an official
visit to Egypt and requested Parliament to give her time to
present her side of the story during the ongoing debate.

other members of the Common Market of Eastern and Southern Africa
(COMESA), which Egypt joined in June 1998, Gowaili was quoted by

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke Ends Emergency Talks, Heads for NATO HQ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 23 (Xinhua) -- United States special envoy
Richard Holbrooke ended his two-day talks with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and was heading to NATO headquarters in
Brussels on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The American diplomat admitted before departure that his
"intense and tortured" talks did not achieve any positive
movement.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke, who came here on Monday after a stopover at the NATO
headquarters in Brussels, held a four-hour talk with President
Milosevic and then discussed with the U.S. presidential security
thinktank in Washington over phone the rest of the night on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
He held talks with the Yugoslav president for another three
hours on Tuesday before making phone calls in the embassy again.
</P>
<P>
He told the press before leaving Belgrade for Brussels that he
conducted two days of intense talks with President Milosevic and
his associates.
</P>
<P>
"We emphasized two things: the evidence that there would be a
cease-fire of the military operations going on in Kosovo; the
readiness to enter into prompt actions that will lead rapidly to a
NATO-led force in Kosovo in accordance with the Rambouillet
accords," he said.
</P>
<P>
He described the talks as very intense and tortured between the
Contact Group, western countries and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The American envoy, who brokered last October cease-fire
agreement, said that the NATO-led force would neither be pro nor
anti any ethnic group in the Yugoslav province but favor only the
peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Though President Milosevic said repeatedly that his side would
not agree to the NATO-led peace implementation force, Holbrooke
said that he could not see either any amendments forthcoming even
after consultation with U.S. President Bill Clinton and U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke's team was instructed by Washington to go to Brussels
and meet with the NATO allies before returning to Washington.
</P>
<P>
The American diplomat said that it would be misleading to
define his talks as having made any positive movement.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the end of his talks with the Yugoslav
president meant a status of war had been established between the
Balkan nation and NATO, the American special envoy said that this
was not in his ken to answer.
</P>
<P>
He added however that the president in the White House was the
one to answer that question.
</P>
<P>
But Holbrooke stressed that communications are always open,
even in times of conflict and that international mediator
Christopher Hill would return to Skopje in neighboring Macedonia
and Belgrade has his telephone number there.
</P>
<P>
He declined to say whether it would be his last diplomatic
effort but that the question had to be dealt with by others.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo observers here tended to believe that Mr. Holbrooke
might have had something from his talks with President Milosevic
but that the thing may be difficult for NATO to accept before
rendering it possible to thaw the current face-off.
</P>
<P>
Last October it was through Holbrooke's shuttle activities
between Belgrade and Brussels that finally led to the cease-fire
agreement and the deployment in the Yugoslav province of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe-led Kosovo
Verification Mission.
</P>
<P>
Monday and Tuesday's was Holbrooke's second trip to Belgrade in
three weeks during the current crisis while he came to Belgrade
three times last October before pinning down the agreement between
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and NATO and the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe.

ANKARA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and Syria will further
boost their economic and commercial ties, Turkish Deputy Prime
Minister Hikmet Ulugbay said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ulugbay made the remarks after meeting with his Syrian
counterpart Salim Yassin, who arrived here Monday for a two-day
visit.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in 12 years that Turkish and Syrian
officials sat down to discuss ways of strengthening economic ties.
</P>
<P>
The last economic gathering between Turkey and Syria took
place in 1987. In the following years, bilateral economic ties
weakened as a result of Syrian support for the outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
Ulugbay said that joint studies are underway in an effort to
tap the great potential in commercial and economic cooperation
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are working on drafting an agreement on
prevention of double taxation and a deal on protecting and
encouraging investments, he said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Support from Congress on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton on
Tuesday met with lawmakers to seek support for U.S. military
action in Kosovo as his special envoy Richard Holbrooke reported
little progress in his talks with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and prepared to leave Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, after meeting with his foreign policy team, gathered
key members of Congress in the White House residence, to impart
the latest information and "make the case for the policy he is
pursuing" White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters. "It's
our hope and our expectation that we will get bipartisan support."
</P>
<P>
The president stated his opposition to an effort in the Senate
to block fund for the mission to airstrike Yugoslav targets,
Lockhart said. Republican Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison said after
the meeting that lawmakers would alter the funding proposal.
</P>
<P>
"There will be, probably, a different kind of amendment,"
Hutchison said. "It becomes a different issue when action becomes
imminent. While many people may disagree with the president's
policies, I would not want Mr. Milosevic to get the impression
that (U.S. forces) may not get full support."
</P>
<P>
Democratic Senator Bob Kerry said he has serious concerns that
getting involved in Kosovo -- coupled with other U.S. deployments
in Bosnia, South Korea and Iraq -- would stretch military
resources too thin.
</P>
<P>
"There's only a certain number of things we can do. I would
have preferred to say in this instance to the Europeans, 'This is
one you're going to have to do'," Kerry said.
</P>
<P>
Still, Clinton "has made the case to me... so I'll support
him," he added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton then made a speech after the meeting, saying the United
States and its NATO allies were "united and prepared" to take
military action against Yugoslav targets.
</P>
<P>
He said if Milosevic was not willing to sign a Western-drafted
peach deal on Kosovo, then the United States and its allies are
willing to limit his ability to make war.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Al Gore said earlier at an American Legion
session that the United States is "determined to act to diminish
the military power...and help the Kosovar Albanians win the
safety, security and self-government they deserve."
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the State Department warned Milosevic not to lash
out beyond Kosovo in the event of a NATO attack.
</P>
<P>
there would be "great consequences" if Milosevic sent troops
beyond Serbia's borders, the State Department said.

<P>
MOSCOW, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov on Tuesday postponed his visit to the United States due
to the NATO intention to strike on Yugoslavia, Itar-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
The cancellation has been confirmed by the White House.
</P>
<P>
When Primakov's plane landed at the Shannon airport of Ireland,
the premier was told that "the breaking of (U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke's) negotiations with Yugoslav President (Slobodan)
Milosevic is 98 percent possible and the United States will use
force against Yugoslavia," Tass said.
</P>
<P>
At that point, Primakov phoned U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who
indicated that force could be used during the American visit of
the Russian delegation.
</P>
<P>
Primakov request that Gore make a reply call to his plane and
confirm that intention.
</P>
<P>
Gore called when Primakov's plane was flying over the Atlantic
Ocean and told him the strike on Yugoslavia was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
After consultations with President Boris Yeltsin, Primakov
decided to postpone his U.S. visit and turned back home, Tass
said.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
said that if NATO launches air strikes on Yugoslavia, Moscow could
break the U.N. arms embargo on Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
"This will be an aggression, so the country which is attacked
must have weapons to defend itself," Ivanov said.

UNITED NATIONS, March 23 (Xinhua) -- China Tuesday voiced its

Kosovo, a Serbian province, saying that the issue should be solved
politically through dialogues.
</P>
<P>
Qin Huasun, the Chinese permanent representative to the United
Nations, told reporters that "the question of Kosovo is an
internal matter of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY)."
</P>
<P>
"Any military action against the FRY without the authorization
of the U.N. Security Council will be a severe violation of the
U.N. Charter and established principles of international law," he
said. "Such action will not be accepted by the international
community."
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government believes that it should be settled
politically through dialogues, on the basis of respect for the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of the FRY and the guarantee
of the legitimate rights and interests of the ethnic groups in the
region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, "we urge the relevant parties to adopt a
restrained, patient and flexible attitude and continue to seek a
proper and fair settlement of the issue of Kosovo through
negotiations," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador made the statement after the U.S.-led
NATO issued repeated warnings to Belgrade that it would risk
getting bombed if it refused to accept the peace plan drafted by
the Western countries.
</P>
<P>
China maintains that only the U.N. Security Council has the
primary responsibility in the maintenance of peace and security in
the world at large, and any military action against a sovereign
and independent country should be officially authorized by the
15-member council.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Nomadic Region Given Ultimatum on Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has appealed to Karimojong, a nomadic people in northeastern part
of the country, who have guns in neighboring districts to take
them back to their district or hand them over to the army.
</P>
<P>
He made the appeal when addressing a public rally in Katakwi
district in eastern Uganda Tuesday afternoon, a press release from
the President's Office said.
</P>
<P>
Indiscipline of stealing cattle, destroying crops and killing
people in neighboring districts by the Karimojong, is
unacceptable, he said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the problem of banditry and cattle rustling
mainly sprang from the weakening of the pillars of state during
past regimes and assured the local people that the government has
managed to rehabilitate and strengthen the pillars of state and is
now ready to contain the Karimojong menace.
</P>
<P>
The government requires the Karimojong to respect the law in as
far as it relates to their neighbors as well as to the communities
within Karamoja itself.
</P>
<P>
According to an order recently communicated to the region, all
the guns should be removed from the neighboring districts within a
period of three weeks from March 12 of 1999.
</P>
<P>
To enforce this, Museveni added, the government will deploy
4,000 soldiers in the areas affected.And a battalion will be
permanently stationed at the boundaries of each affected district.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the government will in the next financial year
create a special mechanized battalion to complement the permanent
infantry troops.
</P>
<P>
The mechanized battalion will have detachments at designated
areas to ensure fast and efficient methods of handling the
Karimojong problem.
</P>
<P>
The Karimojong mounts cattle raids on neighboring communities
particularly the Iteso to the south, Langi and Acholi to the west
and the Pokot Turkana of Kenya to the east.
</P>
<P>
In 1979, they acquired AK 47 and G3 rifles during the time
former President Idi Amin was toppled, when they looted the army
barracks in Moroto District and made off with about 15,000 guns
together with an estimated two million rounds of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
The fleeing soldiers of the Okello government in 1986 meant
additional weaponry. They learned to use the gun through self
training and with the help of the former Karimojong soldiers in
the previous armies.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Court Rules early Release of IRA Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- A Northern Ireland judge Tuesday
dismissed an application by the British government to delay the
early release of four jailed Irish Republican Army (IRA)
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
British Home Secretary (interior minister) Jack Straw wants the
court to review a decision by the Northern Ireland Sentence Review
Commission allowing early freedom for the men, who are all serving
life sentences.
</P>
<P>
But Judge Paul Girvan said after a six-hour hearing in
Belfast's High Court, "I conclude that the reasoning of the
(panel's) commissioners has not been demonstrated to be legally
flawed."
</P>
<P>
The ruling would allow three of the four IRA prisoners to go
home Tuesday night and the fourth man to be released in June.
</P>
<P>
A lawyer for Straw told Girvan he would consult the home
secretary to determine whether an appeal would be lodged against
the judge's decision.
</P>
<P>
Several hundred prisoners from the IRA and pro-British
"loyalist" guerrilla groups have been freed early by the review
commission, a body created under the Northern Ireland peace
agreement. All those still behind bars are to be released by July
2000.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Names New Anti-corruption Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- President Daniel arap Moi Tuesday
 appointed Justice Aaron Ringera as director of the Kenya
Anti-Corruption Authority (KACA) , paving the way for the
resumption of talks on loans with the International Monetary Fund
(IMF).
</P>
<P>
Justice Ringera replaced former director Harun Mwau who was
suspended and became the subject of a tribunal on a charge of
incompetence.
</P>
<P>
A news dispatch from the Presidential Press Service said
Justice Ringera had been recommended by the Advisory Board of the
Kenya Anti-Corruption Authority.
</P>
<P>
The appointment of the KACA director and vice-directors has
been the only remaining obstacle to the re-opening of negotiations
on the resumption of the IMF's 205 million U.S. dollars loan to
Kenya, halted in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The IMF announced in early March that Kenya had met other
conditions set by the agency.
</P>
<P>
Before his appointment to the Attorney-General's chambers in
1997, Ringera was a judge in the High Court.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Anti-Corruption Authority Act provides for two
assistant directors whose appointments are staggered so that at
all times, there is a deputy who serves for two years.
</P>
<P>
Before Ringera's appointment, speculation was rife that the
head of the anti-graft body would be an expatriate.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Hails Libyan Decision to Hand Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Tuesday extended a welcome to the letter from the Libyan foreign
minister to the U.N. Secretary-General, saying that the 15-member
Council "looked forward to the implementation of that handover in
accordance with the agreed arrangements."
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press, the president of the Security
Council, Qin Huasun of China, said that "Security Council members
welcomed the letter from the Foreign Minister of the Libyan Aran
Jamahiriya to the Secretary-General of May 19, 1999, indicating
that the two suspects would be available for the Secretary-General
to take the custody of them on or before April 6."
</P>
<P>
"Security Council members reaffirmed existing Security Council
resolutions as the basis to bring about a full and final
resolution of the situation," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Security Council members looked forward to the implementation
of that handover in accordance with the agreed arrangements and,
taking into account also the information provided by the French
authorities regarding UTA 772, to the immediate suspension of
sanctions with a view to lifting them as soon as circumstances
permit, in accordance with relevant Security Council resolutions,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Security Council members thanked the Secretary-General for his
tireless efforts in reaching an understanding with the Libyan Arab
Jamahiriya on the implementation of Security Council resolution
1192 (1998), and expressed appreciation also for the positive
actions taken by the Governments of South Africa, Saudi Arabia and
other countries in support of these efforts," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
On Friday afternoon, the Libyan permanent representative to the
United Nations, Abuzed Omar Dorda, hand delivered to the U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan a letter from Omar Mustafa Muntasser,
the Libyan foreign minister, confirming the readiness of Libya to
proceed with the transfer of the two accused to the trial before a
Scottish court sitting in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General is greatly encouraged by this
development and the necessary arrangements will now be initiated
by the Secretariat," a Friday statement, issued by the U.N.
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, together with Saudi Arabia, has been at the heart
of the efforts to achieve the breakthrough in solving the
long-standing of the bombing of a Pan Am airliner over the
Scottish town of Lockerbie in December 1988, killing 270 people.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Gasoline Prices Back Over One Dollar Per Gallon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The average price for regular
gasoline in the United States surpassed one U.S. dollar per gallon
this week, the first time in over four months, the Department of
Energy reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
As of March 22, the national average cash self-service price of
regular gasoline was 101.7 cents per gallon, up 4 cents from the
previous week, the department said. The average price has risen a
total of 11 cents since reaching a low of 90.7 cents on February
22.
</P>
<P>
The current average price is 1.7 cents per gallon higher than
the price a year ago, the first year-to-year increase since
October 1997.
</P>
<P>
This week's average price is the highest since October 19,
1998, when prices were in the midst of an eight-month decline.
Rising crude oil prices and refinery problems are cited for the
recent price increase, which are occurring earlier than the
typical demand-driven spring gasoline price rise.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil prices worldwide have risen strongly over the past
month, after reaching 12-year lows in early December 1998, then
vacillating at historically depressed levels until mid-February
1999.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices began to climb in late February, in anticipation of
a reduction of oil output by major producing countries ahead of
this week's meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries in Vienna. As expected, a group of the largest oil
exporters agreed on March 12 to cut crude oil production by 2
million barrels per day, starting in April.

<HEADLINE> (EDS: Added With Clinton's Remarks And Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov abruptly postponed a planned trip to Washington Tuesday
after he was briefed by U.S. Vice President Al Gore on
unsuccessful diplomatic efforts to resolve the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Russia has steadfastly opposed threatened NATO airstrikes
against Serb targets in the province.
</P>
<P>
"After discussing the worsening situation in Kosovo, Prime
Minister Primakov decided to return to Moscow," Gore said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
During a refueling stop in Shannon, Ireland, before the trip
was postponed, Primakov made clear his country's opposition to a
NATO attack.
</P>
<P>
"It is against good sense. We are firmly against this,"
Primakov said speaking through a translator.
</P>
<P>
Gore and Primakov were planning to discuss increased economic
and technical cooperation between the two nations. Primakov also
was scheduled to meet with U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. administration official said Gore had spoken twice with
Primakov today, and described the tone of the conversations as
businesslike.
</P>
<P>
"The vice president was very firm," said the official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity. "The vice president could not
assure Primakov that bombing would not take place while he was
here" in Washington, he added.
</P>
<P>
Gore said he told Primakov that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic "had rejected our efforts to reach a peaceful outcome in
Kosovo and that Milosevic was launching escalated offensive
actions against the men, women and children of Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
"We agreed that we would postpone this week's meeting of the
U.S.-Russian Joint Commission," Gore said. "We will take up the
important work of the commission at a time when both sides can
better focus their attentions on the issues before us."
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, President Clinton warned Yugoslavia again,
saying NATO is "united and prepared" to carry out strikes against
Serb targets.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said if Yugoslav President Milosevic is not willing to
make peace in Kosovo, then the United States and its NATO allies
are willing to limit his ability to make war.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Clinton met with lawmakers Tuesday to seek support
for U.S. military action in Kosovo as his special envoy Richard
Holbrooke reported little progress in his talks with Yugoslav
President Milosevic and prepared to leave Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, after meeting with his foreign policy team, gathered
key members of Congress in the White House residence, to impart
the latest information and "make the case for the policy he is
pursuing" White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters. "It's
our hope and our expectation that we will get bipartisan support."
</P>
<P>
The president stated his opposition to an effort in the Senate
to block fund for the mission to airstrike Yugoslav targets,
Lockhart said. Republican Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison said after
the meeting that lawmakers would alter the funding proposal.

<HEADLINE> UK Inflation Beats Government's Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON March 23 (Xinhua) - The UK's inflation rate has dropped
below the government's target of 2.5 percent to its lowest level
in more than four years.
</P>
<P>
The annual underlying rate of inflation has fallen to 2.4
percent in February, according to official figures released by the
Office for National Statistics Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The headline rate in inflation - which includes mortgage costs
- has fallen to its lowest level since December 1993.
</P>
<P>
The figures provide further evidence that the UK economy is
slowing down sharply and boost hopes that interest rates will be
cut again next month.
</P>
<P>
The fall in underlying inflation was given the full seal of
approval by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Commons Treasury Select Committee, Brown said:
"I think today's announcement of 2.4 percent inflation....shows
that over the years we will meet our inflation target and are
continuing to steer a course of stability in a difficult and
troubled world."
</P>
<P>
The inflation news sparked a brief flurry of buying in London
Stock market, as economists said there was now no reason why the
Monetary Policy Committee wouldn't resume their rate cutting
agenda at the next meeting.
</P>
<P>
However, London shares spent the day in the red, barely lifted
by the inflation news and hit late by a sharp sell-off on Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 index ended 92 points down at 6060, a loss of 1.5
percent.

<P>
LONDON March 23 (Xinhua) - Europe's main stock markets beat a
retreat throughout Tuesday, with all the bourses closing deep in
the red.
</P>
<P>
London shares spent the day in the red, barely lifted by
positive inflation figures and hit late by a sharp sell-off on
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE-100 Index of leading shares closed down 92.3 points at
6060.5 - not far off its lowest point of the day which was down
104 points.
</P>
<P>
Hopes of further cuts in interest rates were prompted by
official data showing inflation in February undershot the
government's 2.5 percent target.
</P>
<P>
But this paled into insignificance as the Dow Jones Industrial
Average nosedived more than 150 points, leaving prospects for
another breach of the 10000 barrier looking unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
Germany's electronically-traded Xetra Dax led the decline,
sinking 3.26 percent to 4870.49, a drop of 164 points, after it
had passed through the psychologically- important 5000 mark in the
morning session.
</P>
<P>
Most of the gains created by the euphoria over the shock
resignation of left-leaning finance minister Oskar Lafontaine
almost two weeks ago now have evaporated.
</P>
<P>
Paris wasn't far behind, with the CAC 40 index losing 2.8
percent, or 117 points, to close at 4079.47.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Vows to Support U.N. Mission in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Tuesday stressed their support for the United Nations Mission in
Bosnia and Herzegovina (UNMIBH) and called upon the leaders of
both entities to honor the Dayton Peace Agreement.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press, the president of the
15-member council, Qin Huasun of China, said, "Council members
reaffirmed their support for the UNMIBH in fulfilling its mandate
in police monitoring, restructuring and reform, in assessment of
the judicial system and in strengthening the legal system's
respect for human rights."
</P>
<P>
The statement came after the Security Council discussed the
report of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on the UNMIBH.
</P>
<P>
"Members welcomed the progress in police restructuring and
reform, as well as in the establishment of the rule of law in both
entities," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"They appealed to both entities to commit themselves to further
progress in order to make it self-sustaining," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Aware of the recent challenges to the political stability of
Bosnia and Herzegovina, the members reminded the leaders of both
entities of their obligation to fulfill the provisions of the
Dayton Peace Agreement and appealed for an effort to ensure the
functioning of common institutions in the country," the statement
added.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Annan presented his report on the situation in
Bosnia and Herzegovina, saying that "the establishment of the rule
of law is a prerequisite for a lasting peace in Bosnia and
Herzegovina."
</P>
<P>
"The rule of law provides an essential safeguard for individual
rights regardless of ethnicity, it gives investors confidence in
the country's future, and it facilitates increasingly close
association between European institutions and those of Bosnia and
Herzegovina," he said.
</P>
<P>
The UNMIBH "continues to play a central role in efforts to that
end under its mandate in police monitoring, restructuring and
reform, assessment of the judicial system and strengthening of the
legal system's respect for human rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The UNMIBH has pursued a strategy of engaging senior officials
in the Republika Srpska and the Federation, through co-location of
the International Police Task Force (IPTF) advisers and launching
a series of inter-entity meetings between officials from the
ministries of the interior," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This strategy of engagement has enjoyed some success in both
entities," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Despite all efforts, it is not clear whether these positive
steps will mark the beginning of self-sustaining progress in
police in police restructuring and reform and the establishment of
the rule of law," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Monitoring, therefore, remains the central to the work of the
IPTF because it enables the mission to identify areas where the
IPTF must focus its programs of training, advising and equipping,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Further progress in the mission's central task of police
reform will require tangible material support for the
modernization of the country's police infrastructure from a donor
community whose support for police restructuring and reform has
until now been relatively modest," he added.
</P>
<P>
The UNMIBH is headed by Elisabeth Rehn of Finland, the
secretary-general's special representative and coordinator of
United Nations operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

<HEADLINE> Light Sentence of Baby Killer Sparks Anger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The black community in
Delmas near Johannesburg was angered Tuesday after a white man was
given a suspended sentence for killing a six-month-old baby.
</P>
<P>
Shouts of "One settler, one bullet" and "Kill the boer, kill
the farmer" rang out outside the Delmas Circuit Court after the
court ruling was handed down, South African Press Association
reported.
</P>
<P>
Nicholas Steyn left the court in effect a free man with a
five-year jail term suspended for three years. But he had to be
protected by police and soldiers from an angry crowd who bayed for
his blood.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers used their rifles to keep protesters away from the
driveway of the magistrate's court and members of the crowd struck
the armored police car carrying Steyn with sticks as it drove away
from the court.
</P>
<P>
The victim's family accused the presiding judge, Tjibbe
Spoelstra, of racism.
</P>
<P>
Angelina Zwane's parents were visibly upset, with her father
Isaac Zwane openly crying during interviews with journalists.
</P>
<P>
Relative David Dlamini said: "If it was a black man who killed
a white person, he would have received about 50 years."
</P>
<P>
Steyn was convicted on March 4 of culpable homicide and assault
for firing the shot that killed Angelina.
</P>
<P>
Steyn shot Angelina while she was being carried on the back of
her 11- year-old cousin, Francina Dlamini, across his property
near Benoni. Dlamini was also struck by the bullet.
</P>
<P>
The judge found that her death was "a tragic accident" as Steyn
had not aimed at the children and had no intention of hurting
them.
</P>
<P>
Forensic evidence presented in court showed Steyn had fired
upward, well above the children, but that the bullet had hit an
overhead electric cable and ricocheted down toward them.
</P>
<P>
Omar, however, appeared to challenge the judgement later
Tuesday, saying he was sure the public was shocked by the mild
sentence.
</P>
<P>
Omar said he would ask for a report on the case from the
director of public prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure the imposition of a suspended sentence caused shock
and unhappiness in the minds of the members of the family, the
community and many others," Omar said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He said the fact that Steyn was found guilty of culpable
homicide and not murder had also shocked the baby's family.
</P>
<P>
"Whilst I cannot comment on the findings and sentence given by
the court, I want to point out the government views all killings
in a very serious light and we expect our courts to give decisions
and impose sentences which are fair and engender a respect for the
courts," he said.
</P>
<P>
The African National Congress in Gauteng said it would proceed
with a civil case against Steyn.
</P>
<P>
Freedom Front leader Constand Viljoen said the sentence was an
indication that South Africa's justice system was still
functioning. He said considering the facts, the sentence was fair
and would contribute to restoring the faith among farmers in the
country's courts.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Military Urged to Ensure Democracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalami Abubakar Tuesday said that the country would be better
served if the military can return to their constitutional duties
of protecting the territorial integrity of the country.
</P>
<P>
Opening a two-day workshop to re-orientate the military and
police for their post-military role, he noted: "we must allow
democracy to take root in our country, if we do not, we will
continue to be isolated in the world."
</P>
<P>
Abubakar who is scheduled to hand over power to President-Elect
Olusegun Obasanjo on May 29, noted that the military has ruled the
country for 29 of the 39 years since its independence in 1960 and
has been blamed for frustrating efforts at democratization in
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
He absolved the military from full responsibility for
undermining efforts at democratization in the west African
country, saying that "politicians have been known to invite the
military to take over in order to settle scores."
</P>
<P>
At the workshop organized by the Defense Headquarters in
capital Abuja, Chief of Defense Staff Air Marshal Al-Amin Daggash
said it would be difficult to insulate the military immediately
from politics after years of incursion.
</P>
<P>
He added that a generation of the officers, especially those
below the rank of colonel, were not familiar with any other form
of governance.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the workshop was designed to re-orientate and
 sensitize members of the armed forces and the police on their
constitutional role as the country transcends into civil rule on
May 29.
</P>
<P>
Daggash said that the workshop would also re-orient the
military to subordinate themselves to civil authority and would
brain-storm on the ways and means to ensure an "enduring and
lasting democracy in the most populous African country.  Light

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Envoy Suggests Talks on Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Ambassador to Kenya,
Farouk Ali Mohammed, said Tuesday a ministerial commission would
be convened between Kenya and Sudan to resolve the refugee
problem.
</P>
<P>
The envoy, who had called on Kenyan Minister for Home Affairs
Shariff Nassir, said the best solution would be to repatriate the
refugees under the auspices of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Nassir said his ministry was concerned about refugees and
requested the Sudanese government to ensure that those refugees
who had come earlier were repatriated before the new ones.
</P>
<P>
He said refugees could not be blamed "since leaders are the
ones who destroy a country". He hoped the civil war in Sudan
would be resolved soon.
</P>
<P>
Nassir urged the east African countries to meet and resolve
the regional problems.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed hoped the rebel John Garang faction would come to the
peace talks scheduled for the end of April in Nairobi and said
that donors were likely to freeze aid to Sudan if the talks
failed.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed said his government advocated unity between northern
and southern Sudan rather than secession, although autonomy for
southern Sudan was not ruled out.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador denied claims of slavery in Sudan and termed it
as a slanderous campaign mounted by people who conceived his
government as fundamentalist and harboring terrorists.
