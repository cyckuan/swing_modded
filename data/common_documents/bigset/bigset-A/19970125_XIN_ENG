<HEADLINE> Cypriot President Grants Pardon to Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Three Israeli convicts,
involved in a daring escape bid from police custody, were
granted a presidential pardon, less than three months into their
sentence.
</P>
<P>
Confirming their release today, George Anastasiades, the
director of the central prison, said a total of 13 prisoners of
various nationalities had been granted pardon.
</P>
<P>
Some of them, including the three Israelis (David Biton, 24,
Shimon Amor, 28, and Avi Biton, 21,) have already left for their
countries, he said. But he declined to say when they were freed.
</P>
<P>
David Biton and Amor were sentenced last November 6 to
four years' imprisonment for planning and helping to free their
compatriots Shuki Samana, 24, and Avi Biton from police custody
last September in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Samana and Avi Biton were being transferred in a police car
to the Larnaca district court to face counterfeit charges, when
David Biton and Amor intercepted the vehicle with rented
motorbikes and at gun point they freed the two men.
</P>
<P>
All the four Israelis escaped and crossed the U.N. buffer zone
into the Turkish-controlled part of Nicosia but later, the same
day, they were handed over to the Cypriot police via the
U.N. Peace-Keeping Force in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Samana walked free after the trial while Avi Biton was
sentenced by the Larnaca court to 30 months' imprisonment for
possessing and exchanging fake U.S. bills in the southern
coastal resort of Ayia Napa.
</P>
<P>
Under Cyprus' constitution, only the president of the
Republic has the power to grant pardons, following
recommendations from the attorney-general.
</P>
<P>
The three men were the only Israelis at the prison, which
also houses around 150 Arab convicts, according to the prison
director.

<P>
PARIS, January 24 (Xinhua) -- France today condemned any
participation by Frenchmen in the reported mercenary force in
Zaire, and again denied any link between the French government and
such mercenaries.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said
France does not have any military cooperation with Zaire and Paris
observes "very strictly" the arms embargo imposed by the European
Union on Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The French daily, Liberation, reported today that 280 European
mercenaries, including Frenchmen and led by Belgian Christian
Tavernier, are fighting for the Zairean government against Tutsi
rebels in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"I am formal. There're only five French military men present in
Zaire. France respects very strictly the arms embargo of the
European Union," said the spokesman, referring to the French
military attache and four French paramilitary policemen at the
French embassy in Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
"If it was confirmed to be exact, as certain media have
indicated, that the French nationals were acting under private
terms as mercenaries in Zaire, such actions could not but be
condemned in the clearest way because they do not square with the
policy of France," said the spokesman.

URUMQI, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Seismologists and soldiers in
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have been sent to Jiashi
County, which was rocked by a strong earthquakes Tuesday, to join
in rescue work there.
</P>
<P>
The quake, measuring 6.4 on the Richter Scale, killed at least
12 people and injured more than 40, causing a great deal of
property damage.
</P>
<P>
A team of 11 seismologists from the Xinjiang Seismological
Bureau flew 1,500 kilometers from Urumqi to the quake-stricken
area on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Setting up headquarters in a small hotel, they rigged a direct
phone line to send in data on the quakes information about the
devastated county. They warned that there could be a number of
aftershocks measuring more than five on the Richter scale, and
local authorities evacuated people from houses considered unsafe.
</P>
<P>
There was no report of new casualties, even though there have
been more than 400 aftershocks in the past several days, more than
20 of which were above four on the Richter Scale.
</P>
<P>
PLA soldiers and armed police stationed in Xinjiang went to
Jiashi and other quake-affected areas to help with rescue and
relief work. They have donated more than 20,000 yuan (about 2,400
US dollars) in relief funds and over 600 items of clothing, and
transported over 100 tons of relief materials to the
quake-stricken areas.

MANILA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Although the presidential
election in the Philippines is still 18 months away, Vice
President Joseph Estrada officially launched his bid for the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting here today, Estrada's Party of the Filipino Masses
and Senate President Ernesto Maceda's National People's Coalition
jointly nominated the vice president as the candidate for
president.
</P>
<P>
In their speeches at the meeting, Estrada and Maceda appealed

However, unofficial political maneuvering began in the country
last year.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos' ruling Lakas-NUCD (National Union of
Christian Democrats) has not nominated its candidate, but as a
ruling party member, Speaker of the House of Representatives Jose
de Venecia has proclaimed his intention to run for the office.
</P>
<P>
It was reported however that Defense Secretary Renato de Villa
would join the ruling party and is likely to be chosen as the

<P>
Liu said China should accelerate reforms and the structural
adjustment in the defense industry, which plays an important role
in the country's economic development and national defence in
future.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Second Prime Minister's Party Refuses Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen said today that his Cambodian People's Party
(CPP) will not join a new alliance headed by the Funcinpec Party.
</P>
<P>
He said his party would not accept an invitation to join the
National United Front (NUF), but would want to continue working
with the Funcinpec of First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh in
both government and parliament.
</P>
<P>
As the CPP's vice chairman, Hun Sen made the announcement when
answering reporters' questions during a break at the opening
session of the CPP's annual congress.
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to join with any front," Hun Sen said. "We
will not form any front, but we will cooperate with any political
party if necessary.
</P>
<P>
"It is not necessary to join an alliance because we have a
constitution which allows all political parties to live together
in society," he added.
</P>
<P>
The NUF is a new political alliance formed by the Funcinpec
Party in a bid to run for local elections later this year and
national elections in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Its charter has been approved by the Funcinpec Party, the Khmer
Nation Party led by former finance minister Sam Rainsy and the
Democratic National Union Movement.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh told reporters on Thursday that he would go
personally to present the front's charter to CPP Chairman Chea Sim
and see "if the CPP is able to join."
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh said the front is "not an alliance against this or
that" and is open to all including the CPP.
</P>
<P>
If the CPP refuses to join, the front will go ahead alone to
run for the upcoming elections, Ranariddh added.
</P>
<P>
Funcinpec and the CPP, the two largest parties in the National
Assembly, formed an alliance after U.N.-sponsored elections in
1993.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Party Leader Speaks On Multi-Party Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, a member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party
of China (CPC) Central Committee, told a group of officials today
that the role of China's non-communist parties to supervise over
the CPC should be enhanced and improved in the multi-party
cooperation system.
</P>
<P>
Li, also chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference, made the remarks at
commencement services for a class on the united front and
multi-party cooperation for senior officials at the provincial or
ministry level.
</P>
<P>
Li said that, since China launched its reforms and opening up
drive, the scientific and cultural level of Chinese officials has
greatly improved, and that should be regarded as a major
achievement in the country's effort to produce more qualified
officials.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, while there is a great deal of knowledge
about the natural sciences, some officials fall rather short when
it comes to comprehensive social knowledge.
</P>
<P>
"Some comrades don't even have an adequate understanding of
some common knowledge in the social sciences and of fundamental
theories of Marxism," he remarked.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that officials, especially senior ones, find
it impossible to observe and understand the world's development,
and to find solutions to a range of complicated problems if they
know little about Marxism and other areas of the social sciences.
</P>
<P>
"The central leadership of the Party with comrade Jiang Zemin
at the core have always placed great importance on studying the
social sciences, and have tried to set a good example for the
whole Party in this respect," he said, and called on all
officials, including those from non-communist parties, to strive
to improve their knowledge and understanding of Marxism.
</P>
<P>
In referring to the principle of "long-term co-existence and
mutual supervision" for China's multi-party cooperation system, he
said it reflects the intimate relations between the CPC and the
non-communist democratic parties, which have the same basic
interests.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China's reforms, opening-up, and
modernization drive need the CPC to set up various supervisory
systems, including supervision from non-communist parties.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized that supervision of non-communist parties
must be conducted with the idea of helping improve and strengthen
the CPC leadership instead of negating or weakening it.
</P>
<P>
"The CPC and democratic parties are friendly parties working
side by side for China's prosperity, democracy, and socialist
ethical and cultural development. Their relationship is not one
of a leading party and oppositional parties," he concluded.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Terrorists killed 15 civilians,
including 10 women and a two-year-old child, outside the Algerian
capital Algiers on Thursday night, Agence France Presse (AFP)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The massacre, which took place at 2300 (2200 GMT) at a farm in
Haouche el Hadj, was described as "butchery" by witnesses, who
provided horrifying details.
</P>
<P>
Two inhabitants of the farm were gravely wounded but managed to
escape from a team of some 20 killers armed with knives, axes and
spades.
</P>
<P>
The killings follow another massacre on Wednesday night at
another farm a couple of kilometers from Haouche el Hadj, in which
19 people had their throats cut by the terrorists.
</P>
<P>
All the victims of the massacres were buried this morning, AFP
said.
</P>
<P>
The Armed Islamic Group (AIG), the most radical of the
fundamentalist groups, has intensified terrorist attacks,
including bombing attacks in the cities and massacres in the
villages, since the beginning of the Muslim fasting month of
Ramadan on January 10.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 people have been killed in the last 14 days.
</P>
<P>
In a statement published on Tuesday, the AIG said it planned to
step up the pace of its campaign of violence.
</P>
<P>
"The war will continue and will intensify during the month of
Ramadan and we have the means and the men to punish those who are
not on our side," said the statement.

<HEADLINE> No EU Expansion Until Early Next Century: Dutch Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Dutch State Secretary of
Foreign Affairs Michiel Patijn said today that the European Union
(EU) will not take in new members until early next century.
</P>
<P>
Addressing ambassadors of Central European countries at a
conference in The Hague, Patijn said membership negotiations would
start six months after the Inter-Governmental Conference (IGC) on
a new EU treaty finishes in the summer.
</P>
<P>
"The Netherlands wants the IGC to be rounded off in Amsterdam
in June, so that the political decisions on expansion can be taken
at the EU Luxembourg summit at the end of the year," the state
secretary said.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands currently holds the rotating EU presidency.
</P>
<P>
Previously, the European Commission (EC) made its prediction
that the 15-member bloc would not be enlarged until the start of
the next century, sparking serious concern among the Eastern
European countries most likely to join the bloc.
</P>
<P>
Later, the EC corrected the statement by saying new accessions
could be realized any time.
</P>
<P>
The EC has already said that, shortly after the conclusion of
the IGC, it would be presenting its proposals on enlargement and
draw up an advisory report for each candidate country, as well as
an overall strategy.
</P>
<P>
No negotiations will be conducted on enlargement during the
half-year Dutch EU presidency which started on January 1, although
Patijn noted that the time would need to be used in order to
identify potential complications in advance.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Government Bonds Could Top 400 Trillion Yen in 2005 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese Finance Ministry
warned today that outstanding government bonds could top 400
trillion yen (about 3.45 trillion U.S. dollars) by fiscal 2005 if
the government fails to cut spending.
</P>
<P>
A ministry report submitted to the Budget Committee in the
House of Representatives says the government will face an
estimated revenue shortfall of more than 4 trillion yen (34.5
billion dollars) in fiscal 1998 due to debt-servicing and other
spending increases.
</P>
<P>
The report recommends government expenditure be thoroughly
reviewed to restore Japan's fiscal health.
</P>
<P>
Kyodo news service reported that the ministry has mapped out a
medium-term fiscal outlook following the adoption of a plan late
last year by the cabinet to end the government's reliance on
deficit-covering bonds to cover revenue shortfalls by the end of
fiscal 2005.
</P>
<P>
The report offers two scenarios on the assumption that
deficit-financing government bonds, of which 7.47 trillion yen
(64.85 billion dollars) are planned to be issued in fiscal 1997,
will be annually reduced by 1 trillion yen (8.65 billion dollars)
over eight years.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Squeezes Alcohol Industry to Boost Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The cash-starved Ukrainian
government is targeting the alcohol industry to increase state
revenues by raising taxes, setting mandatory prices and sending
tax inspectors to distilleries to crack down on black marketeering.
</P>
<P>
Deputy prime minister Viktor Pinzenik justified the moves,
saying that it was understandable for the government to collect
high taxes because the production cost of Ukrainian vodka is very
low.
</P>
<P>
The government issued a decree early this month, banning sales
of all alcohol except beer in spaces smaller than 20 square
meters. The move was aimed at boosting revenue by bringing all
alcohol sales into larger stores that are easier to regulate.
</P>
<P>
But thousands of roadside kiosks across the country still sell
all sorts of alcohol, including imported beer and liquor. They
often buy and sell illegally produced alcohol to avoid paying tax.
</P>
<P>
The government is also trying to weed out illegal producers and
smugglers of alcohol who accounted for more than half the 320
million liters of alcohol sold in the country last year.
</P>
<P>
The former Soviet republic wants set minimum prices for alcohol
to stop illegal sales at low prices and ensure a level playing
field for legal producers.
</P>
<P>
Leonid Svatkov, president of the National Food Industry
Committee, said legal producers would not be forced to raise
prices.
</P>
<P>
But he added that the task of forcing illegal producers to
surrender would be very difficult.
</P>
<P>
Legal producers are also planning to undercut their illegal
competitors and force them out of the market.
</P>
<P>
Although the government has tried to crack down on cross-border
smuggling, one of the main sources of illegal alcohol, it is still
a thriving business along Ukraine's 4,650-kilometer border which
is difficult to police.
</P>
<P>
Pinzenik said border guards will get bonuses equaling the value
of their haul if they confiscate smuggled goods.
</P>
<P>
The government estimates half of the production from legal
distilleries finds its way onto the black market. So it has now
decided to follow Russia's lead and send tax inspectors into
Ukraine's distilleries to make sure that all alcohol going out of
the factory gate is subjected to tax.
</P>
<P>
After Russia introduced tax inspectors last year, its legal
alcohol industry imposed huge price hikes which led many producers
to the brink of collapse. Economic experts fear the same thing
could happen in Ukraine.

<HEADLINE> UNECE Lists 15 Preliminary POPs to Be Included </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Economic
Commission for Europe published here today an initial list of 15
persistent organic pollutants (POPs) after a five-day meeting of
the UNECE working group on strategies.
</P>
<P>
"We have reached a decisive stage in the drawing up of a
protocol on persistent organic pollutants (POPs)," said Lars
Nordberg, deputy director of the UNECE environment and human
settlements division.
</P>
<P>
"It has not been easy to draw up an initial list of POPs for
inclusion in a protocol because so many interests are at stake,"
he noted, adding that some POPs are useful for agriculture and
even for human health although they are generally harmful to human
beings.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations are going on to have a new protocol to the
Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution signed in
Geneva in 1979 under UNECE auspices.
</P>
<P>
The 15 POPs, which may be included in the draft protocol on
POPs, are aldrin, chlordane, chlordecone, DDT (DDD and DDE),
dieldrin, dioxins (OCDDs), furans (PCDFs), endrin, heptachlor,
hexabromobiphenyl, hexachlorobenzene, mirex, PAHs, PCBs, and
toxaphene.
</P>
<P>
Short-chain chlorinated paraffins, lindane and
pentachlorophenol will require further examination before a

<P>
POPs are divided into three categories: industrial chemicals,
by-products or contaminants, and pesticides. Their concentrations
increase in fatty tissues.
</P>
<P>
In its press release, the UNECE gave an example to explain how
POPs gradually build up in the food chain. Although the
concentrations of a substance such as PCBs or DDT deposited into a
lake may be very low, they will be concentrated in the fatty
tissues of plankton living in the lake. Fish feeding on the
plankton will further concentrate the PCBs or DDT. This process
will be repeated in fish-eating birds, mammals and humans.
</P>
<P>
Very high concentrations of these substances have long been
associated with a number of carcinogenic and other health effects.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, however, there has been a growing body of
information showing that much more subtle effects can occur at
environmental concentrations which may be a result of long-range
transboundary air deposition. Some of these health effects are
immune suppression, intellectual impairment and birth defects.
</P>
<P>
"That is the reason for the development of the protocol," said
Nordberg.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Ethiopia Attains Second Consecutive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Chen Cailin)
</P>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's grain
production in 1996/97 has been prospected to reach 11.7 million
tons, representing a 20.6 percent increase over 9.7 million tons
in the previous year, the Crop and Supply Assessment of the
United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO ) and the
World Food Program (WFP ) said in an earlier announcement.
</P>
<P>
This is the second consecutive bumper harvest for Ethiopia
following the excellent 1995/96 season.
</P>
<P>
According to the FAO and WFP, the major increase in grain
production is in Amhara and Oromiya regions, a 24.9 percent and
22.3 percent increases respectively, which account for 80 percent
of the national crop production. The output of Teff, a staple
food for the Ethiopians, increases by 17 percent, while maize by
25 percent, sorghum by 27 percent, wheat 23 percent and barley 8
percent.
</P>
<P>
The bumper crop harvest in the 1995/1996 season has
dramatically improved the food supply in the country. Ethiopia,
with a population of 54 million, is the third largest population
country in Africa. Due to the overgrown population, frequent
natural calamities and civil conflicts, the nation has been among
the few countries which have been severely affected by food
deficit for two decades since the first half of the 1970s.
Following the good harvest in 1995/96, the food gap at the
national level was substantically narrowed. This year's harvest
has further improved the food situation in the country. the
nation has attained food self-sufficiency at the national level
and started exporting grain. The Ethiopian Trade Enterprise has
planned to export 20,000 tons of maize.
</P>
<P>
What makes Ethiopia, a food deficit country in the past 30
years, sufficient in food supply in a very short time. the answer
is that the Ethiopian government has put first priority to the
agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
Land under food production has been increased in the past
years. 400,000 farmers have been encouraged to participate in the
agricultural development program and about 400,000 farmers have
been organized under the program. The government supplies farmers
with improved seeds and fertilizers and tries to increase input
for agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Peaceful situation and good rains in the last two years have
been described as ''important contirbutors'' to the higher
agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
But good rains will not come every year for Ethiopians. They
must raise their ability for combating natural calamities. Not
long before, the government worked out a food security strategy
Under which Ethiopians will put special emphasis on soil and
water conservations, irrigation and tree planting in an attempt
to further promot agricultural production.

<HEADLINE> Chirac, Kohl Ratify Joint Defense Strategic Concept </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 24 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl ratified a text on a new joint
defense strategic concept between the two nations, which stresses
their "indissociable" common security interests, during their
summit last month.
</P>
<P>
Le Monde, a local daily, today published an excerpt of the text
signed by Chirac and Kohl on December 9, 1996 in Nuremberg, which
was translated from its German version.
</P>
<P>
But the French government today refused to comment on the
report, which the newspaper said remained classified documents
until now, said the Agence France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
The text said that the Franco-German Council of Security and
Defense, co-presided by Chirac and Kohl, "has decided to give a
new impulse to Franco-German cooperation in the field of security
and defense in a European as well as Atlantic perspective."
</P>
<P>
"France and Germany, while being members of the European Union,
the Atlantic Alliance (NATO), and the West European Union (WEU),
are at the center of a network of solidarity," said the text.
</P>
<P>
It said that France and Germany are ready to "open dialogue
over the role of nuclear deterrence within the context of the
European defense policy."
</P>
<P>
"Our two countries are exposed to the same risks.... The need
remains for a territorial defense and a defense of the alliance
because a fundamental change of the conditions of security in
Europe cannot be ruled out," it said.
</P>
<P>
It also said, "All our classic forces, including the forces of
rapid reaction, is in priority at the disposal of the defense of
the allies within the framework of the obligations which follow
the treaties of Brussels (on the WEU) and Washington (on NATO)."
</P>
<P>
Le Monde said that although the text "presents above all a
synthesis of perceptible orientations (adopted by Chirac) over the
past several months," it signals the breaking of some "dogmas"
maintained by the post-war French governments under President
Charles de Gaulle, President Georges Pompidou and President
Francois Mitterrand.
</P>
<P>
The text could also meet opposition from some old Gaullist
deputies in the National Assembly and the French Senate, if it was
submitted to them, said the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> UK Retail Sales Fall 0.8 Pct in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The suspected weakness of
overall Christmas retail sales in Britain was confirmed Thursday
by official figures, prompting speculation that UK interest rates
would be left unchanged before the general election.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that retail sales
fell 0.8 percent in December after a 0.8 percent rise in November,
the biggest drop in 16 months and is much worse than analysts'
expectation of a rise of 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Against a year ago, sales were up only 2.9 percent in December
compared with a year-on-year growth of 3.9 percent in the previous
month.
</P>
<P>
Sales of clothing and footwear fell by an unprecedented 4.6
percent last month in spite of price falls of 0.2 percent, and
were a key factor behind the overall weakness in sales, the ONS
said.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury downplayed the weakness of the figures, saying
that the underlying trend in retail sales remained firmly upward
with sales volumes having risen by 0.9 percent over the past three
months and sales of household goods having been particularly
strong.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, economists said that the fall would help Chancellor
of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke resist Bank of England pressure to
raise base rates from the current 6 percent level.

<HEADLINE> Economic Growth Slows Down in Ulster in 1996: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Economic growth in Northern
Ireland slowed down and trailed the rest of Britain as a whole for
the first time this decade, according to a report published
Thursday by the accountants Coopers and Lybrand.
</P>
<P>
The report said that after consistently outperforming the UK in
the 1990s, Ulster's gross domestic product (GDP) grew an estimated
2 percent in 1996, down from 2.5 percent in the previous year.
This compares with an estimated growth rate of 2.25 percent in the
country as a whole last year.
</P>
<P>
The mad cow crisis, slower growth in traditional export markets
and the ending of the Irish Republican Army's (IRA) cease-fire all
contributed to the slowdown.
</P>
<P>
The study pointed out that due to lower demand in key European
markets, destocking by Ulster companies and the impact of the mad
cow crisis on meat processors, the region's manufacturing output
growth fell to 0.3 percent last year, against 4.2 percent in 1995
and 7.2 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, manufacturing employment dropped 1.7 percent
compared with growth of 3 percent in 1995 and 1.9 percent in 1994.
This was the first rise in redundancies since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Tourist numbers suffered a 10 percent fall with the resumption
of para-military violence in the province and the pound's
appreciation also discouraged cross-border shoppers from the Irish
Republic.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland, which accounts for 28 percent of the UK's
beef exports, was particularly hard hit by the European Union's
ban on UK beef exports, as cattle prices fell 25 percent due to
lower demand and one in five meat businesses reported cashflow
problems.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on future growth in the province, the report said
that it would have "as much to do with confidence as with
opportunity."
</P>
<P>
"The business community can deliver the exports and the
profits. It is up to the government and the politicians to deliver
the confidence," the report said.

<HEADLINE> WHO: 21 Countries Certified as Free of Guinea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-one countries have been
certified as "being free of dracunculiasis transmission," Hiroshi
Nakajima, director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO),
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
According to a WHO press release, the last dracunculiasis cases
date back to October 1993 in Pakistan, while Iran has not reported
any cases since the middle of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Dracunculiasis, a debilitating parasitic disease also known as
guinea worm disease, has not been reported during this century, or
the conditions needed for its transmission do not exist in the
other 19 countries: Austria, Barbados, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria,
Colombia, Cook Islands, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Finland,
Kiribati, Mongolia, Papua New Guinea, Romania, Singapore, Solomon
Islands, Switzerland, Trinidad and Tobago, and Vanuatu.
</P>
<P>
The above decision is based upon the recommendation of the
International Commission for the Certification of Dracunculiasis
Eradication, a global body established in 1995 under the guidance
of WHO.
</P>
<P>
Although widely prevalent at the beginning of the 20th century,
WHO said, guinea worm disease exists today in dwindling endemic
areas in 16 countries of Africa south of the Sahara, as well as in
India and Yemen in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Between 1992 and 1996, the number of endemic villages around
the world was reduced from 23,000 to 9,900. Many of the endemic
countries today experience only a handful of cases.
</P>
<P>
During 1996 all countries, except for Sudan, experienced a
reduction in the number of indigenous cases, of between 21 percent
and 85 percent.
</P>
<P>
The global campaign against guinea worm began in 1980 within
the context of the International Drinking Water and Sanitation
Decade.
</P>
<P>
WHO said that dracunculiasis may become the first parasitic
disease to be completely eradicated by human effort in the near
future. However, continued international support is essential, WHO
warned.

<P>
A statement issued by the Secretary to the cabinet, Frank
Buckhan, accused the federation of taking instructions to
misguide foreign organizations, reported the Southern African
Broadcasting Associations.
</P>
<P>
Buckhan said the government will take appropriate steps
against some foreign groups which are known to have
infiltrated into the country to destabilize the tiny kingdom.
</P>
<P>
However, Buckhan failed to name the alien groups.
</P>
<P>
He said all affiliated industry unions should ensure their
leaders adhere to the basic principles of industrial relations
and oppose to serve misguided leadership interests.
</P>
<P>
The statement came following threats by the federation to call
another nationwide strike early next month for improving working
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland was almost paralyzed by a month-long mass stay-away
action early last year, which was launched by the labour
federation for getting better working conditions.
</P>
<P>
The strike ended after King Mswati had promised to examine the
workers' demands.

<HEADLINE> UK Exporters Express Relief From Falling Pound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The pound plunged against the
US dollar and the Deutsche mark Thursday after traders stopped
expecting strong rises in Britain's base rates.
</P>
<P>
The pound dropped 4.5 pfennings against the mark and 2.6 cents
against the dollar to close in London at 2.668 marks and 1.628
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The pound's fall will come as a relief to Britain's exporters,
which have been hit by its 13 percent rise against a basket of
currencies since August.
</P>
<P>
Pound began falling when US investors reportedly sold an
estimated 2 billion pounds (3.25 billion dollars) in New York
trading Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
It was also triggered by comments on the same day from
Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke, who cited the strong
pound as a reason not to raise base rates from 6 percent after his
latest monthly meeting with Eddie George, governor of the Bank of
England.
</P>
<P>
However, commenting on the currency's fall, Neil MacKinnon,
chief economist at Citibank in London said, "My feeling is that
the big move in sterling is exhausted. Many fund managers are
taking the view that ahead of the election they don't want to add
to their exposure in sterling."
</P>
<P>
In Britain, the pound began to fall just as the Chambers of
Commerce (BCC) declared that nearly every company in the country
had begun to suffer from the high pound restricting
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
The BCC urged the government not to raise interest rate. Its
deputy director-general Ian Peters said that resisting a further
rise in interest rates was important if the manufacturing recovery
was not to be "snuffed out."
</P>
<P>
Further rate rises would lead to an even greater appreciation
of sterling, he argued.

<HEADLINE> Credit Cards Fraud Exposed in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Three Greek men alleged to have
innovated a method of using stolen credit cards to acquire
hundreds of millions of drachmas worth of goods from stores in
Athens were arrested by police today.
</P>
<P>
Police said that it was the first time this particular type of
fraud has been discovered internationally.
</P>
<P>
Working out of a luxury apartment in the seaside suburb of
Glyfade, near the capital, the alleged con men used a special
machine to read, delete and enter data contained in the magnetic
strip on the back of credit cards.
</P>
<P>
According to police, the innovation consists in the fact that
the machine was used to enter false data on the magnetic strip
which bore absolutely no relation to the cardholder's details
appearing in relief on the front of the card.
</P>
<P>
Police said bank ATMS (automatic teller machines) and credit
card machines used in stores were unable to ascertain agreement
between the name on the front of the card with the data contained
in the magnetic strip.
</P>
<P>
The three arrested were identified as Moses Solomos, 49,
Constantine Marantos, 38, and Vassilis Kalaitzidakis, 51.

LUSAKA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- A medical team was sent to

</P>
<P>
The disease has resulted in at least 18 dead and 40 others at
hospital since two weeks ago.

LUANDA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The new Angolan government of

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Algerian President Liamine
Zeroual denounced this evening the existence of a "conspiracy"
against Algeria with aid from "foreign forces and Algerian
personalities," according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Zeroual made the statement in a televised speech to the nation,
amid an escalation of violences perpetrated by Islamic extremists,
who have killed at least 200 people since the beginning of the
Muslim fasting month of Ramadan on January 10.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Arabic and sitting by the side of an Algerian
national flag, Zeroual said that the conspiracy, "which tries to
sow fear and terror among the citizens (of Algeria)," will not
destabilize the nation or waver the determination of the Algerian
government to "eradicate terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Zeroual did not specify which foreign forces were backing
terrorism in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
He was apparently blaming the Algerian opposition parties,
which allied with the outlawed Islamic Salvation Front in Rome in
January 1995.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM Calls for Muslim Countries Solidarity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's Prime Minister
Necmettin Erbakan today described the formation of the D-8 Group
which comprises eight developing Muslim countries as a first step
toward the new international order.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan made this remark at a dinner given for the ambassadors
of Muslim countries in Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The two-month-old D-8, which groups Turkey, Egypt, Pakistan,
Indonesia, Nigeria, Iran, Bangladesh and Malaysia, was formed at
the suggestion of Erbakan, with an aim to be a vis-a-vis of the
industrialized G-7 bloc.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the banquet, Erbakan said that the old
international system formed during the Cold War was out-of-date,
adding "the G-7 and D-8 will come together to establish a new
world order."
</P>
<P>
He said the D-8 was a positive measure for enhancing
solidarity among Muslim countries in a world currently dominated
by the Western countries.
</P>
<P>
Muslim countries should strengthen their cooperation in the
economic field in order to have a stronger voice in the future new
world system, said Erbakan.
</P>
<P>
The first D-8 foreign ministers meeting was held in Istanbul,
the largest city of Turkey, early this month to discuss
political, trade and economic ties among the group members and
did preparatory work for the group's summit scheduled for the
first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of the foreign ministers
meeting, Erbakan accused the European Union and the United States
of putting pressure and economic sanctions on Islamic states and
exploiting the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The United States has frowned upon the establishment of the D-8
Group.

Kategaya praised Libya's efforts on helping its neighbors
get rid of troubles, reiterating Uganda's stand on maintaining
Zaire as a united country.

<HEADLINE> Life in A Camp in Quake-Stricken Parts of Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KASHGAR, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The moon was up and the night
seemed colder, and alongside a military tent, a Uygur farmer was
feeding his two donkeys with a bunch of straw.
</P>
<P>
Memet and his donkeys had survived a terrible earthquake on
Tuesday that measured 6.4 on the Richter Scale, in northwest
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. The tremor claimed at
least 12 lives and injured more than 40.
</P>
<P>
The quake devastated much of Jiashi County in Kashgar, causing
a great deal of property damage, mostly houses and cattle, and was
followed by hundreds of aftershocks, some very strong, over the
past few days.
</P>
<P>
The relief work has gone smoothly, and most who lost their
houses have been moved into tents or makeshift shelters. "For the
first few days after the quake," Memet said, "my neighbors and I
had to spend the night in the bushes. The PLA gave me this tent
last night, and I'm much warmer in it."
</P>
<P>
One who was having a harder time was Niyat Talifu. Wearing a
typical Uygur woolen overcoat, the aged storekeeper lit a fire by
the side of the road to withstand the freezing temperature of the
long night.
</P>
<P>
"My family are in the shelters," he explained, "but I have to
sleep out in the open air all night to keep an eye on the goods
that I retrieved from my grocery store."
</P>
<P>
One surprise was the electric light that could be seen in a
shelter where the farmer Tursun Seyleyi and his family of nine
were living. "We have a small generator of our own," he explained.
</P>
<P>
The shelter was heated by a stove in the center, and the family
seemed to have just finished their dinner, with some bowls of
noodles still sitting on the table. The family had a guest, who
made the small room seem even smaller: an old woman from a
neighboring village.
</P>
<P>
"She lost her house," Seyleyi said, "We all suffered from the
disaster and should share what we have."
</P>
<P>
At the PLA campsite for soldiers and armed police engaged in
rescue and relief, soldiers exhausted from the day's labors were
sound asleep in their tents. Their beds were a thin layer of straw.
</P>
<P>
A relief official said that the soldiers had refused the use of
mats offered by the local government, claiming that they should
not add any burden to the disaster area.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Opposition Leads in Lower House By-Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Preliminary results of the
by-elections for five vacant seats of Nepal's lower house showed
that the communist opposition party has won in two of the five
constituencies, the Election Commission announced today.
</P>
<P>
Candidates from the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist
Leninist, CPN-UML) won the most votes in the two constituencies in
Kathmadnu and Sunsari, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
Vote-counting of the by-election in the constituency in West
Nepal's Rupandehi district is still going on, an official of the
Commission told Xinhua by telephone.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, results of the by-elections in other
two constituencies will come out later as vote-counting in the
Baitadi constituency is yet to begin and voting at two polling
stations in the Rautahat constituency has been rescheduled for
Sunday after incidents of polling booth capturing.
</P>
<P>
The by-elections were held Friday in the five constituencies
with a total of 46 candidates running for the five vacant house
seats.
</P>
<P>
By winning the two vacant seats in the House of Representatives
first, the main opposition CPN-UML, which held 87 seats in the
house before the by-elections, would remain to be the largest
party in the parliament unless the ruling Nepali Congress (NC)
party could won all the three vacant seats to be announced later.
</P>
<P>
The NC party, which leads the present three-party coalition
government, currently has 86 MPs in the 205-seat house.

<HEADLINE> Spring Festival Reception for Taiwanese in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- A reception was held in Beijing
today by the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee
of the Communist Party of China for Taiwanese residing here, to
celebrate Spring Festival which falls on February 7.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Tinghan, deputy head of the United Front Work Department
of the CPC Central Committee, extended greetings to the guests and
summerized China's achievements over the past year in reforms,
opening to the outside world, the modernization drive, and
diplomatic work, and called the year of 1997 an extraordinary one.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong's return and the convening of the 15th
National Congress of the Communist Party are the two major events
this year. On July 1, China will resume sovereignty over Hong
Kong, undoing one hundred years of humiliation and marking China's
victory in reunifying the motherland, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said the reunification represents the aspirations of the
entire Chinese people including those of Taiwanese
compatriots. The question of Taiwan is an internal affair that has
an important bearing on China's sovereignty and reunification, he
added.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Taiwan's authorities have, he noted, stuck to
their position of splitting the country and preventing
reunification in their so-called "elastic and pragmatic
diplomacy", attempting to create "two Chinas" and "one China and
one Taiwan". Any attempt to split China is doomed to failure, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the new year, "We will adhere to the principles
of peaceful reunification and 'one country, two systems',
implementing the eight-point proposition on the promotion of
peaceful reunification of the motherland put forward by Jiang
Zemin, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee," he said.
</P>
<P>
Efforts shall also be made to promote direct exchanges across
the Taiwan Straits and to make new contribution to reunification,
he added.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the United Front Work Department of the CPC
Central Committee, Zhang thanked the Taiwanese compatriots for
their good work for socialist modernization, culture, scientific
research, and for reunification.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that they will increase their ties with
the United Front Work Department and contribute to reunification,
reforms, and opening up, as well as to socialist modernization.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhaoguo, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and head of the
United Front Work Department, attended the reception.

<HEADLINE> EU Envoy Meets Somali Faction Leader Amid Renewed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 25 (Xinhua) -- EU envoy to Somalia Sigurd
Illing today met with northern Mogadishu faction leader Ali Mahdi
Mohamed over the restoration of the security in the capital
Mogadishu, a day after Friday's renewed fighting near the Dolow
town.
</P>
<P>
The heavy fighting has continued into later Friday evening
between the Ethiopian government forces and the Islamic
fundamentalists group of Al-Itihad Al-Islam around the Surgudud
village, 10 kilometers south of Dolow, said local reports.
</P>
<P>
Heavy artillery rounds, anti-aircraft missiles and heavy
machine guns were exchanged around the village, leaving two
civilians dead and four others wounded, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
The clash broke out a day earlier when some 100 armed
Ethiopian ground forces attacked the village of Gawido, 9
kilometers north of the border town of Bulo Hawo.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Dahir Aweys, the military commander of Al-Itihad
fundamentalist group, said his fighters have so far failed to
regain the grounds they lost to the Ethiopian forces late
December outside the Dolow town.
</P>
<P>
Reports from a field radios there said local residents have
fled and evacuated the Gawido and Surgudud villages, mainly for
Luq, some 70 kilometers east of Dolow town, the strongholds of
the Islamic fighters, following the renewed bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian forces did alledgedly not honor the appeals made
by Hussein Mohamed Aidid and other Somali factions for the
unconditional withdrawal of their forces, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
During today's talks, EU envoy Illing expressed his support to
the meeting of Mogadishu's faction leaders on Monday, calling on
Mogadishu's factions to work together on pacifying Somalia and
its capital Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The two main faction leaders of Mogadishu have pledged their
collaboration with the latest peace initiatives and the
humanitarian assistance by the international community.
</P>
<P>
Factions in Mogadishu were expected to hold negotiations soon
over their political disputes.
</P>
<P>
Illing also met with Hussein Aidid Friday over the
reconciliation and facilitation of the humanitarian deliveries.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Plans to Increase Oil Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait is planning to
increase its oil production capacity by 500,000 barrels per day
by the year 2000 to reach 3 million barrels, Kuwaiti oil
minister has said.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with local Arabic daily Al-Anbaa
published today, Minister Issa Mohammed Al-Mzaidi said Kuwait
has already mapped out special plans to develop the petroleum
sector and increase productivity according to projections of
future rises in global demand for petroleum.
</P>
<P>
The minister said "Kuwait is among a few states in OPEC
(Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) that have
potentials to meet higher demand in the future as its current
production capacity stands at 2.5 million barrels per day and we
have plans to increase it to 3 million barrels per day by the
year 2000."
</P>
<P>
He said that in order to increase oil output, the concerned
authorities have worked out a plan to dig new wells and build new
oil installations in the northern region, which is rich in
high-quality crude.
</P>
<P>
He said the British Petroleum Company, which struck an
agreement with the state-owned Kuwaiti Oil Company last year,
was conducting some necessary studies on northern oil fields and
giving technical advise to develop them.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has a proven oil reserve of 100 billion barrels. It has
so far been unsuccessful in its calls for a higher quota in OPEC
which set the export quota for Kuwait at 2 million bpd.
</P>
<P>
Oil experts expect that the world demand for oil, especially
the demand from the Asia-Pacific region, will continue to be
robust over the next decade and beyond and the overall oil needs
in the region will to a large extent be filled by the Middle East
oil.
</P>
<P>
Besides meeting export potentialities, Kuwait is also aimed
at enhancing both at home and abroad its oil refining capacity
which is now at 500,000 barrels per day. Kuwait Petroleum
Corporation (KPC) has set itself a target of building refining
capacity of 400,000 bpd in Asia by the year 2000 through joint
venture operations.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has signed recently a series of agreements with major
international oil companies concerning oil development
techniques, refining and exports.
</P>
<P>
Al-Mzaidi anticipated an increase in oil prices, citing some
reasons such as the biting cold prevailing in the northern
hemisphere of the earth and the oil companies' bids to increase
their reserves.
</P>
<P>
The prices of oil on the international market soared to a
record level of 21 U.S. dollars per barrel during the last
quarter of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The minister played down the negative impact of Iraqi reentry
into the world market on the world oil demand and supply
balance, saying that "the impact of Iraq's return to the oil
market depends on conditions prevailing on the market."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations allows Baghdad to export 2 billion dollars
worth of oil every six months on renewable basis to purchase
food and medical supplies for the Iraqi people.

<HEADLINE> India Issues New Rules for Investment in Aviation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government has
issued some new guidelines for investment in aviation which will
make it more difficult for foreign companies to enter the
country's aviation sector, according to local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
At a cabinet meeting on Friday, the government decided that any
proposal related to the entry of foreign airlines into the
domestic sector will have to be referred to the Ministry of Civil
Aviation for clearance.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made when the cabinet was discussing a
controversial joint venture proposal between India's Tata company
and Singapore Airlines which has already been cleared by the
Foreign Investment Promotion Board.
</P>
<P>
The decision has virtually ruled out the Tata-Singapore
Airlines joint venture proposal which was submitted to the cabinet
for final clearance.
</P>
<P>
Civil Aviation Secretary Yogesh Chandra said on Friday that any
Indian national can start a new airline but the question of
foreign airlines' participation must be decided by the Ministry of
Civil Aviation.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Peace Negotiators to Meet on Recent Clashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Peace negotiators of the
Philippine government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)
are scheduled to meet on Sunday to resolve their recent armed
conflict in the southern Philippines, the Philippine News Agency
said today.
</P>
<P>
The news agency quoted Ghadzali Jaafar, MILF vice chairman for
political affairs, as saying that representatives of the two sides
would meet in Sultan Kudarat town, Maguindanao province, to
discuss how to settle their clashes in Buldon town, the MILF's
main camp in the province.
</P>
<P>
At least four soldiers and 33 rebels have been killed and
dozens of others on each side wounded in the conflict which
erupted on January 16.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Management Staff Secretary Alexander Aguirre has
said the government would continue to hold peace talks with the
MILF despite its recent stepped-up attacks on government troops.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a breakaway faction of the mainstream Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF) which concluded a peace pact with the
government last year, has rejected the government-MNLF peace deal
and demands separate peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The Buldon conflict broke out at a time when the government and
the MILF were ironing out trifle differences in preparation for
their future formal peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The two sides' peace negotiators, who held their first round of
low level talks in Sultan Kudarat last month, are scheduled to
meet again on February 25-26.

<HEADLINE> Over 11,000 Mozambicans Suffer from Leprosy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 25 (Xinhua) -- As many as 11,642 Mozambicans
suffer from leprosy, listing the country the second and the
ninth leprosy-affected country respectively in Africa and in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The local Noticias newspaper today quoted the Health Ministry
as saying that 6.46 percent of the Mozambicans are lepers and
almost eight among 100,000 Mozambicans have to live in solitude
due to the disease.
</P>
<P>
Northern provinces including Nampula, Cabo Delgado, Niassa and
Manica are more seriously affected by the illness. These regions
are expected to get more help from the World Health Organization
and international donors in the anti-leprosy campaign.
</P>
<P>
However, the number of registered lepers in the southern
African country fell from 18,000 four or five years ago to 1995's
some 12,000, an expert named Alfredo Junior was quoted by the
report as saying.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 25 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province has become the largest trade partner with Australia in
China.
</P>
<P>
Exports from Australia to south China have increased from
580 million Australian dollars to one billion dollars in the past
three years.
</P>
<P>
Now Australia is seeking more investment opportunities in south
China over the coming years.
</P>
<P>
Australian companies are negotiating with officials in
Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province, on the
construction of key infrastructure projects. These include a
stretch of light-rail and an international airport in Guangzhou,
with total investment exceeding 10 billion yuan (or two billion
Australian dollars).
</P>
<P>
A great potential for economic and trade cooperation exists
between Australia and areas in south China, said Zena Armstrong,
the Australian consul general to Guangzhou, while addressing a
seminar on bilateral economic cooperation in Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
The consul general revealed that Australia will this year shift
the emphasis of investment to commodity retail and wholesale,
municipal engineering, building material and processing of
foodstuffs.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of the goods imported from Australia have then
been re-exported to other Chinese provinces. Australian investment
in Guangdong has totalled some 300 million Australian dollars over
the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Kate Carnell, a senior Australian official, predicted that
China will be the second largest trade partner of Australia this
year, while the Pearl River Delta will be a springboard for
Australia to expand its development in China.

<HEADLINE> China to Have Biggest Encyclopedia of Literature And Arts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- China has plans to publish an
encyclopedia of literature and the arts that will perhaps be the
biggest in the world, by the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Culture said today that the
500-million-character, 300-volume book will fully cover the glory
of China's art for the past 5,000 years. It consists of ten
sections that include literature, music, opera, dance, folk tales,
and other literary and artistic genres.
</P>
<P>
Some 50,000 Chinese researchers and publishers have taken part
in the remarkable program, which began in 1979, and has been
referred to as "China's Cultural Great Wall".
</P>
<P>
The work is unprecedented in Chinese history, or in world
history for that matter, according to State Councillor Li Tieying,
who sent a letter of congratulation to the publisher to mark the
appearance of the first 100 volumes.
</P>
<P>
"It is an honor for the nation and the Chinese people, and an
important contribution to the world, fully demonstrating the
superiority of the socialist system," Li said.
</P>
<P>
China has a long history of compiling large historical and
cultural annals, the most famous being the "Encyclopedia Sinica",
a large series of compiled by hand by scholars under the auspices
of the Qing government during the reign of the Qian Long emperor
(late 18th century). The encyclopedia was a collection of Chinese
classics and traditional philosophy and was so large that it was
stored in more than 6,000 boxes.

<P>
WUHAN, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Tianmen City in Central China's
Hubei Province, is increasing its appeal to more investors from
home and abroad by improving its infrastructure and creating a
sound investment environment.
</P>
<P>
Tianmen, reputed for its high degree of education and large
number of natives residing overseas, has invested 300 million yuan
(one U.S. dollar equals to 8.3 Chinese yuan) building a bridge
across the Yangtze River. The bridge links the Wuhan-Yichang,
Wuhan-Jinsha and Yichang-Huangshi highways. The area also has
installed switchboards capable of handling 100,000 telephone
lines, said local officials.
</P>
<P>
According to the officials, the city set up an overseas
investment development zone in 1995, which has so far attracted
19.28 million U.S. dollars worth of foreign funds, and is now home
to 18 businesses.

Businesses from a dozen countries and regions, including the
United States, Sweden and the Republic of Korea, regularly visit
the development zone in the hope of finding investment
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the city generated 14 billion yuan of combined
industrial and agricultural output value.
</P>
<P>
The officials added that the city will try harder to build
itself into a medium-sized city based on textiles, commerce and
trade, culture and tourism.

<P>
HONG KONG, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Official sources said the
serious fire that gutted a karaoke club in Tsim Sha Tsui and
killed 15 people this morning may have been set deliberately.

<HEADLINE> Hashimoto, Kim Start Talks In Shadow of Comfort Women Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto and South Korean President Kim Young Sam began their
summit talks today at the hot springs resort of Beppu in
southwestern Japan.
</P>
<P>
The issue of comfort women was high on the agenda of the two
leaders who aimed to "promote amicable and cooperative relations
between Japan and South Korea."
</P>
<P>
But the meeting was overshadowed by a gaffe by Hashimoto's
chief cabinet secretary and top government spokesman Seiroku
Kajiyama who Friday criticized planned coverage of the issue in
junior high school textbooks.
</P>
<P>
He said it was odd to teach children about Asian women forced
to provide sex for Japanese soldiers before and during World War
II, without also teaching them the social background of an
authorized prostitution system which existed at that time.
</P>
<P>
"Those who are making a fuss over the issue do not know the
authorized prostitution system existed in those days," he said.
He also pointed out that the women got paid when they went to the
front.
</P>
<P>
Kajiyama's stance on the comfort women issue is echoed by some
of his Liberal Democratic Party colleagues, who insist that
teenage students should not be taught about it.
</P>
<P>
But the Japanese Education Ministry in June approved the
inclusion of accounts of "comfort women" in all seven authorized
junior high school history textbooks to be used from next April.
</P>
<P>
Historians estimate that between 100,000 and 200,000 women,
mostly from the Korean Peninsula then under Japanese colonial
rule, were forced into sexual slavery for Japanese soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Kajiyama made the remarks at a regular press conference after
a private fund initiated by the Japanese government paid
compensation to seven South Korean former comfort women earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
South Korea criticized Japan recently for deciding to pay
compensation to former comfort women through the Asian Women's
Fund.
</P>
<P>
It said payment should be made directly by the Japanese
government which announced in August 1993 that in many cases the
women were drafted against their will, "through coaxing, coercion
and so on."
</P>
<P>
The government said that at times, administrative and military
personnel directly took part in the recruitment, noting that
"undeniably, these were acts involving the military authorities of
the day that severely injured the honor and dignity of many women."
</P>
<P>
Apart from the comfort women issue, Hashimoto and Kim were also
expected to emphasize the positive areas of bilateral relations,
which have been frail at best since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
Reaffirmation of continued coordination between Tokyo and Seoul
toward Democratic People's Republic of Korea was another theme in
their talks.

<HEADLINE> Creative Ideas to Promote Basic Law Awarded in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Making postcards carrying articles of
the Macao Basic Law, contests of knowledge of the law within family
members, promoting the image of a rabbit "Anzai" holding a book of the
law in a row were among those creative ideas awarded here today.
</P>
<P>
Other awarded ideas on the promotion of the law include drawing
lottery tickets made of bookmarks carrying articles of the law,
putting up the law posts in the street or on public buses, stage plays
on the theme of the law, and distributing picture books on the theme
to primary school students.
</P>
<P>
"Introducing the law in an interesting, easy-to-understand way is
no easy job," said Lei Peng Chu, one of the judges of the current
contest on creative ideas to promote the law. "However, some of these
ideas sound new and practical."
</P>
<P>
To be enacted from December 20, 1999 when China resumes the
exercise of sovereignty over Macao, the law will serve as a
mini-constitution for Macao, and therefore needs to be known by as
many Macao residents as possible, said Lei, who is also
editor-in-chief of the Macao Daily News.
</P>
<P>
The contest was jointly launched by the Youth Committee of the
Macao Chamber of Commerce and the Macao Telecommunications Company
(CTM) late last year. It aimed at both collection of creative ideas
and the promotion of the law among youngsters.
</P>
<P>
Eleven students' unions in Macao schools and another eleven
social youth organizations submitted a total of 22 proposals to
promote the law with a supposed budget of 200,000 Patacas (about
25,300 US dollars). One social youth organization and two students'
unions won the first prize.
</P>
<P>
"Although some of the ideas were taken use of before and some
seem similar to each other, those proposals demonstrate that the
young people have taken it as their destined duty to promote the
law," Lei said. "That is highly commendable."
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years following the promulgation of the law
in 1993, series of activities were conducted both in Macao and
China's inland to improve the awareness of the law. The promotion
campaign is expected to go further this year.

<HEADLINE> Old Chinese Canal Still Vital for Inland Water Transport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, January 25 (Xinhua) -- A millenium after it was
built, China's ancient Grand Canal, which runs from Beijing to the
city of Hangzhou is still carrying boats as the only inland
waterway linking northern and southern China.
</P>
<P>
The northern section, from Beijing down to Jining in east
China's Shandong province, about 700 km, has been closed for
decades to transport because of silting, but the 1000-km section
from Jining southward to Hangzhou remains the "main artery on
water" for the three eastern provinces of Shandong, Jiangsu, and
Zhejiang.
</P>
<P>
In the case of Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang province, the
canal is responsible for nearly 40 percent of its cargo transport,
and the Tangxi section, in Yuhang county near Hangzhou, handles an
average of 4.8 ships every minute.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of boats and barges use the canal each day and the
three provinces have had a number of dredging projects to better
accommodate water transport. By the end of 1995, the section south
of the Yellow River and north of the Yangtze River was able to
accommodate 1,000-tonnage ships.
</P>
<P>
One renovation project on the 208-km section in southern
Jiangsu, costing 1.5 billion yuan, is now underway, and Zhejiang
has connected the canal with the province's five-river system,
forming a water transport network linking all parts of the
province.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the projects, the water transport volume for Zhejiang
province is expected to exceed 26 million tons in 1996, a record.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang plans to put 640 million yuan (77 million US dollars)
more in repairing bridges, embankments, and the watercourse
itself, while the state has listed renovation of the Grand Canal
as a major project for inland water transport in the period to the
end of the century.

Control Board (CPCB) has just served closure notices to 26 major

</P>

According to an announcement available here today, the notices

The industrial units include distilleries and factories

<HEADLINE> Anti-Aids Drug Tests Suspended in S.Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Human trials using a new
anti-AIDS drug called "Virodene P058" developed by a group of
South African scientists have been suspended amid mounting
scepticism in the country.
</P>
<P>
The suspension followed a Friday meeting held among AIDS drug
researchers, South Africa's Medicines Control Council (MCC) and
the Ethics Committee of the University of Pretoria's Faculty of
Medicine, the local The Citizen reported today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting agreed on halting treatment with the new drug
until MCC and the Ethics Committee of Pretoria University
complete studies on all available information on the drug's
effects.
</P>
<P>
The scientists in Pretoria University announced at a cabinet
meeting on Wednesday that their latest development of Virodene
P058 had produced far better results for curing AIDS patients
than any existing drugs on the market.
</P>
<P>
They claimed that results of preliminary trial with the drug
on a dozen AIDS patients over the past several months have
suggested a major breakthrough in the fight against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
However, local medical experts expressed doubtfulness towards
the so-called "breakthrough invention."
</P>
<P>
AIDS, an abbreviation of the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome,
is a lethal disease that is usually transmitted through sexual
intercourse, blood transfusion and drug abuse.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, US Expected to Sign Open Sky Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and the United
States are expected to finalize their open sky agreement by April,
Malaysian Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik said today.
</P>
<P>
"Discussions on the matter began since the visit of US
Transport Secretary Frederico Pena here last year," Ling, who is
also president of Malaysia Chinese Association, told reporters
after a party meeting in Malacca, according to the Malaysian
national news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
Ling said that further discussions were held from time to time
to eliminate duplication or other problems in formulating the text
of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The agreement would open up more routes for Malaysia Airlines
(MAS), which currently has six flights a week to Los Angeles, to
the US including more landing rights and destinations, he said.
</P>
<P>
If the agreement was ratified, MAS could fly to the United
States from any other country which has agreement with Malaysia,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement would also introduce the concept of open
agreement in aviation which enables an airline to use the services
of another airline to fly to the US, he added.
</P>
<P>
"As an example, MAS can have an open cooperation with any
airline...if the airline does not have a route to the United
States, we can ferry their passengers using MAS aircraft," Ling
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ling said most of the problems faced by MAS had been settled
following a meeting with the pilots, staff and the MAS management.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: HK Provisional Legislative Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Provisional Legislative
Council (PLC) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)
held its first meeting here today to elect its president.
</P>
<P>
The election signifies the operation of the 60-member PLC,
which was set up at the fourth meeting of the 400-member Selection
Committee for the First Government of the Hong Kong SAR held in
Shenzhen on December 21 last year.
</P>
<P>
To date, the establishment of the PLC has been endorsed by
various sectors in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Hong Kong people now held that the formation of the
PLC is essential for Hong Kong's smooth transition and the
effective operation of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side has repeatedly reaffirmed that the setting up
of the PLC is a measure it has to adopt after the British side
unilaterally carried out its so-called "Constitutional Package".
</P>
<P>
The "Constitutional Package", which contravened the
Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong, the
principle of convergence with the Basic Law and the agreements and
understandings reached between the Chinese and British
governments, has destroyed the "through train".
</P>
<P>
Under the "through train" arrangement, members of Hong Kong's
existing Legislative Council, upon confirmation by the HKSAR
Preparatory Committee, would be members of the first Legislative
Council the HKSAR so long as they are loyal to the HKSAR
government and the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
From April to November 1993, the representatives of the Chinese
and British governments held 17 rounds of talks on the
arrangements for the 1994-95 elections in Hong Kong, which are to
produce the three-tier political structure: the Hong Kong
Legislative Council, urban and regional Councils and district
boards.
</P>
<P>
However, before the representatives of the Chinese and British
governments could reach agreement for the 1994-95 elections in
Hong Kong, the British side unilaterally discontinued the talks at
the 17th round and submitted to the Hong Kong Legislative Council
part of the question under discussion between the two sides, which
directly led to the termination of the talks.
</P>
<P>
Obviously, it was the British side's disruption that scuttled
the talks for the 1994-95 electoral arrangements, which in turn,
destroyed the "through train" for Hong Kong's three-tier political
structure.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and the Standing Committee of China's
National People's Congress (NPC) have made it clear that the Hong
Kong Legislative Council, district boards and municipal councils
elected under Patten's package will stop functioning in mid-1997
when China resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The political structure of the HKSAR after July 1, 1997 will be
built in accordance with the relevant decisions of the NPC and the
provisions of the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Now that the "through train" has been destroyed because of the
British side's unilateral act, it would be impossible for the
first legislative Council of the HKSAR to be formed at the time
when the HKSAR is established.
</P>
<P>
In that case, lots of legal work stipulated by the Basic Law
and NPC's decisions for the HKSAR's Legislative Council will be
either delayed or suspended, such as the law concerning
application for HKSAR passports and visa issuing, law about
HKSAR's flag and emblem, as well as appointment of the judges of
the Court of Final Appeal and Chief Justice of the High Court.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, to avoid a legal vaccum after July 1, 1997, there
should be a provisional legislative council (PLC) to enact
necessary laws and ordinances for the future HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
At the second session held in Beijing On March 24, 1996, the
Preparatory Committee for the HKSAR of the NPC made a decision on
setting up HKSAR's Provisional Legislative Council (PLC).
</P>
<P>
The PLC, which is broadly represented in Hong Kong communities,
consists of 60 members, with 33 people serving at Hong Kong's
existing legislative Council and 11 permanent Hong Kong residents
with no Chinese citizenship or with right of abode in foreign
countries.

PARIS, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- In a speech consecrated to the wave of violences which is
striking his country, Algerian President Liamine Zeroual Friday
promised to "exterminate" groups of Islamists and denounced a
"conspiracy" against Algeria carried out with aid of "foreign
forces."
</P>
<P>
-- Seeing the daily massacres in Algeria which have killed more
than 200 people since the beginning of the month of Ramadan, the
political and intellectual circles of France remain silent, partly
because of the complexity of the conflict and the embarrassment of
the French leaders over their failure to help the Algerians.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Faced with a degradation of the situation in his country,
and pushed by the media and the opposition, Algerian President
Liamine Zeroual made a 20-minute speech on television Friday which
delivered nothing new. Since he came to power in December 1995,
Zeoual has never changed his strategy, which is based on a
calendar to hold elections step by step, and accentuating pressure
on terrorists.
</P>
<P>
-- France and the United States are showing differences over
the on-going counter-offensive by Zairese government forces
against Tutsi rebels. While Paris described the action by Zairese
troops as "little surprising," Washington has expressed its worry
that it will bring about an escalation of the conflict in the
Great Lakes region, and has urged an immediate ceasefire and the
holding of talks between the belligerents.

DAMASCUS, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Damascus, capital of Syria,
is suffering from serious pollution on account of the immense
increase in the number of minibuses and other vehicles in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The total number of minibuses rose to 11,000 last year with
an increase of 4,000 compared with that in 1995, while other
vehicles increased to 194,000 during the correspondent
period, according to official Syrian sources.
</P>
<P>
Additional roads, tunnels, fly-overs and bridges are needed in
the capital city to confront the situation, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Damascus is suffering from traffic problems in view
of the numerous cross-roads and traffic lights, causing jams as
well as rising pollution.
</P>
<P>
The sources call for a scientific and realistic study of the
capital's need for various means of transportation. They also
suggested the opening of tunnels and the building of fly-overs at
cross-roads of busy traffic areas and other locations in the
city, to ease traffic jams and facilitate the flow of vehicles.

CAIRO, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- Cyprus will take measures to restrict the number of
foreign workers on the island and severely punish those who
employ illegal foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Interior Dinos Michaelides said recently that the
number of foreign workers in Cyprus has multiplied six times
from 4,000 in 1987 to 26,000 now, while the illegal foreign
workers are estimated at about 10,000.
</P>
<P>
He announced that from January 1, 1997, those who employ
illegal workers will be punished with up to three years
imprisonment and a fine of 5,000 Cyprus pounds (about 10,000
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- The newly appointed Cyprus Airways (CA) chief Takis
Kyriakides has called for drastic measures to rectify CA's
situation which he described as gloomy, according to local media
reports.
</P>
<P>
Kyriakides told the House Finance Committee that the company
losses for 1996 are expected to reach 6-7 million Cyprus
pounds (about 12-14 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
He forecast that the CA will face economic difficulties in
1997 and 1998, with losses expected to exceed 16 million
Cyprus pounds (about 32 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Kyriakides noted that increased costs, competition and
liberalization of air transport are problems that have to be
tackled.
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- The Cyprus Stock Exchange (CSE)'s all-share index
fell to a new all-time low in the past few days. On Tuesday the
CSE had recorded what was its lowest closing level since the
official exchange was launched in March last year.
</P>
<P>
It is generally felt that investor's concern about the
political tensions in Cyprus, relating to threats by Turkey over
the island's planned purchase of Russian-made anti-aircraft
missiles, is depressing share prices.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Eighteen new cities, which is expected to absorb 3.5
million citizens and provide 700,000 job opportunities, will be
set up in the new Delta region along the Nile river in Egypt,
local Arabic-language newspaper Al Gomhouria reported today.
</P>
<P>
Investment assigned for the establishment of these cities are
estimated at 33 billion Egyptian pounds (about 9.7 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Fertilizer, cement, mineral water, marble and red bricks
industries will be set up in these cities.

creating a Disaster Management and Mitigation Unit (DMMU) under
the Office of the Vice-President Godfrey Miyanda, Miyanda said
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
It is the time for Zambia to prepare adequately with
institutional capacity in anticipation of disasters as Zambia is
prone to various natural disasters which require urgent attention
whenever they occur, said Miyanda.
</P>
<P>
Under the DMMU, the government will create a data bank, train
personnel, and form an information network so as to be able to
coordinate operations facing disasters caused by water borne
diseases, floods and drought, he said.
</P>
<P>
Miyanda called on donors to offer equipment to help the
Zambian government fight the disasters, particularly drought and
floods.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Development Program has promised to give
Zambia 10,000 U.S. Dollars for disaster preparedness and
mitigation.

NAIROBI, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Kenya harvested 24 million
bags of maize (90 kilos per bag) last year, a 17 percent drop in
comparison with 29 million bags in the previous year, according
to a Kenya Times report today.
</P>
<P>
The erratic and inadequate rainfalls last year caused a drop
in Kenya's food production, especially maize, the staple food of
Kenyan people, said the paper quoting Permanent Secretary for
Agriculture Karega Mutahi as saying on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement yesterday, Karega Mutahi said that Kenya
produced 3.1 million bags of wheat last year as against 3.4
million bags in the previous year, while bean production fell
from 4.9 million bags in 1995 to 2.4 million last year.
</P>
<P>
In the industrial sector, there was an increase in sugar
production last year, with 390,000 tons as compared to 384,171
tons in 1995 while Kenya had an upshot in the production of
coffee, tea and horticultural crop.
</P>
<P>
The statement came in the wake of a hue and cry, picturing a
grim food situation in the drought-stricken areas in Kenya's
eastern, northeastern and central provinces.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Lashes Out at Japan for Denial of Comfort Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) today accused the Japanese government of
conniving with right-wringers who had attempted to deny the issue
of comfort women.
</P>
<P>
A commentary published by Rodong Sinmun, the mouthpiece of the
ruling Workers' Party of Korea, said the incident of comfort
women, who were sex slaves forced to serve wartime Japanese
troops, was one of the most heinous crimes committed by the
Japanese army during World War II.
</P>
<P>
Any attempt to deny the issue of comfort women is a brazen
denial of history, it said.
</P>
<P>
It criticized some members of the ruling Japanese Liberal
Democratic Party for calling for removing the chapter concerning
comfort women form Japanese history textbooks.
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese authorities try to gloss over the crimes at any
cost, bury the historical facts in oblivion and avoid making
compensation," it added.
</P>
<P>
The commentary demanded that the Japanese government honestly
admit all the past crimes including the issue of comfort women,
apologize and compensate for them.

<HEADLINE> PC Legal Panel's Suggestions Correct: Tung Chee Hwa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa cited here today
suggestions by the legal panel of the Preparatory Committee (PC)
to amend some Hong Kong laws as correct, rejecting the saying that
these proposals would lead to a "democracy recession" in the
region.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held after the first meeting of the
Provisional Legislative Council (PLC), Tung, chief executive of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), said that the
British Hong Kong Authorities' unilateral amendments to some
original laws and ordinances contravened the Sino-British Joint
Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong and the principle of
convergence with the Basic Law of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
After reviewing the process of the British Hong Kong
Authorities' actions for drafting Bill of Human Rights Ordinance
and for revising Societies Ordinance and Public Order Ordinance,
he pointed out that the enacted ordinance and the amendments to
the original ordinances by the British Hong Kong government were
breach of the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
He said the suggestions set forth by the legal panel of the
Preparatory Committee (PC) were absolutely not "democracy
recession" and that they have nothing to do with the question of
human rights.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the rights of an individual is important, but the
social order, stability and prosperity are important too.
</P>
<P>
"What we should consider is "how to pursue a balance", he added.
</P>
<P>
Tung voiced his disagreement with some people's viewpoint that
PC's suggestions will undermine the confidence of the foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that as far as he knew from latest surveys,
90 percent of the French businesspeople, 92 percent of the British
businessmen and 95 percent of the American businessmen in Hong
Kong responded positively toward Hong Kong's future, showing their
growing confidence in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that the Sino-Joint Declaration on the Question of
Hong Kong and the Basic Law stipulate that after Hong Kong's
handover in the middle of 1997, the existing ordinances and laws
of Hong Kong will basically remain unchanged. And any change in
this regard should be done on the basis of the consensus reached
by the two sides through consultations.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, the British side unilaterally amended some of the
original ordinances without any consultations with the Chinese
side. To readdress the issue, the PC legal panel will certainly
raise their recommendations on the subject, he added.
</P>
<P>
Finally, Tung urged all sectors to unite and take into account
the overall interests of Hong Kong at such a critical moment during
the transition period so as to build a bright future.

<HEADLINE> Five Executed for Producing Counterfeit Spirit in Yunnan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Five criminals who were found
guilty of producing and selling counterfeit spirit which caused 36
deaths, were executed in Huize County, southwest China's Yunnan
Province, today.
</P>
<P>
Li Rongping and Jiang Hongmei, husband and wife, were farmers
of Liucun Village, Zhehai Town, Huize County, Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
During the period from July 1995 to February 1996, they hired
Yin Guangcai and other people to produce and sell inferior bulk
spirit with edible alcohol. They were fined and their products
were sealed up and confiscated.
</P>
<P>
Although knowing that methyl alcohol was poisonous, the couple
who wanted to seek more profits still purchased 3,300 kilograms of
methyl alcohol from a chemical company on June 15, 1996, and
instructed Yin and others to make over 10,000 kilograms of
spirit. As a result, 33 people died and more than 100 injured
after drinking the spirit.
</P>
<P>
Peng Chuanyun, a farmer of Fanjia Village, Zhehai Town, Huize
County, was fined and his workshop closed down for using edible
alcohol to make inferior spirit in February 1996.
</P>
<P>
On June 15, 1996, Peng purchased 510 kilograms of methyl
alcohol from Li Rongping and produced 2,000 kilograms of spirit
which caused two deaths.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jianwu, a farmer of Luobugu Town, Huize County, bought 82
kilograms of methyl alcohol to made and sell spirit causing one
death.
</P>
<P>
The death penalty was meted out by the Yunnan Provincial Higher
People's Court with the approval of the Supreme People's Court.
</P>
<P>
The People's Daily will carry a commentary tomorrow saying that
the move "has sounded a warning against those who are seeking
exorbitant profits by making and peddling fake goods."

<HEADLINE> PLC Poses No Threat to British HK Government: Rita Fan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Rita Fan, the newly-elected
president of the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC), said here
today that the PLC poses no threat to the governing authority of
Hong Kong, which, at this moment, is with the British Hong Kong
government.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held here right after PLC president
election, Rita Fan Hsu Lai-Tai noted the work of the PLC is aimed
at enacting laws that must come into effect on July 1.
</P>
<P>
She said that opposition and in-cooperative attitudes adopted by
the British Hong Kong government toward the PLC are attributed
more to political reasons than to the actual situations.
</P>
<P>
She beat Andrew Wong by 33 votes against 27, at the first meeting
of the PLC held here today.
</P>
<P>
Fan said she herself agreed very much to the necessity and
legal standing of the PLC, adding that she will take up
opportunities to explain them to the public.
</P>
<P>
The power of the PLC to make laws and its legal standing came from
relavant decisions by China's National People's Congress, she noted.
</P>
<P>
The body has been given the duty by the Preparatory Committee for
the Hong Hong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) to look into the
bills to be introduced by the first government of the HKSAR and the
bills which they consider have to be handled by the PLC,
Fan continued.
</P>
<P>
"We only handle those (laws and ordinances) that have to be
handled before the first Legislative Council of the HKSAR is
established," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
The next meeting of the PLC is temporarily scheduled for the late
February, Fan said, and expressed the hope that members of the
Secretariat of the Legislative Council would stay on to serve the PLC.
</P>
<P>
The two special working groups will be set up soon to work on
PLC operational rule and administrative structure, she added.
</P>
<P>
Rita Fan said that she hopes that the PLC will foster a
legislative culture that fits Hong Kong, that is, to deal with
things with a practical, rational, active and constructive
approach.

<HEADLINE> Voter Turnout Gets Record High in Nepal's By-election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Voter turnout rates reached a
record high of 73 percent in the lower house by-election held on
Friday at five constituencies in Nepal, the Election Commission
said today.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 200,000 out of a total of 236,000 eligible voters cast
their ballots on Friday to elect five parliament members to fill
vacant seats in the House of Representatives concluded in the
evening peacefully.
</P>
<P>
The voter turnout rates ranged from 72 to 89 percent in four
constituencies including the one in this capital city while only
45 percent of voters in far-western Nepal's Baitadi constituency
cast their votes mainly due to the heavy snowfall and severe cold
weather there, the commission added.
</P>
<P>
Vote-counting is underway in three of the five constituencies
and the results will be announced later today, an official of the
commission told Xinhua, adding that candidates from main
opposition the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist,
CPN-UML) are leading in the three constituencies respectively in
Kathmandu as well as Sunsari and Rupandehi districts.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the by-election results in other two
constituencies in Baitadi and Rautahat districts will come out
after one or two days.
</P>
<P>
It was because of the transportation problem in the remote
Baitadi district and the cancellation of voting at two polling
stations in the Rautahat constituency after the opposition's
complaints of polling booth capturing by supporters of main ruling
the Nepali Congress (NC) party.
</P>
<P>
Rescheduled voting at the two Rautadi polling stations will be
held on Sunday, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba's NC party has vowed to win
the by-elections at all the five constituencies while the
opposition CPN-UML said it will win at least three to remain as
the largest party in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML currently has 87 MPs while the NC holds 86 seats in
the 205-seat lower house, which has five vacant seats.

BANGKOK, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh has insisted that he had never said that the second
Bangkok international airport at Nong NGU Hao is to be scrapped.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters on Friday that the new airport project had
been delayed for a long time and it could not be completed by the
year 2000, as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
He said putting Nong NGU Hao airport project on hold and
expanding Bangkok's existing Don Muang International Airport would
suit the country's current economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
The country faces current account deficit and the government is
trying to reduce it.
</P>
<P>
The new airport, situated to the Southeast just outside
Bangkok, would cost 100 billion baht (4 billion US dollars) while
expansion of the Don Muang airport would need only one-tenth of
the cost, according to the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The expansion is expected to be able to cope with increasing
passenger volume for another 10 years, or at least 6-8 years more,
the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
At the cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Chavalit proposed a
postponement of constructing the Nong NGU Hao project because of
its high cost and slow progress. Most ministers at the meeting
went along with the idea but no decision was made.
</P>
<P>
Nong NGU Hao, which means cobra swamp in the Thai language, is
low-lying and the airport would need land refill and a six-km-long
flood prevention wall round the airport site.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Muslim-Croat Federation in Crisis, Zubak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 24 (Xinhua) -- President of the Bosnian
Muslim-Croat Federation Kresimir Zubak today said that the
federation was in crisis and the Bosnian Muslims should be held
responsible for that.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Croatian media, Zubak accused Bosnian
Muslims of violating the agreement the two sides reached under the
auspices of the United State, under which Zubak will be succeeded
by a Croat other than a Muslim.
</P>
<P>
That was why the Croat lawmakers decided Wednesday to boycott
the federation's parliament, Zubak said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton accord which ended the Bosnian war in 1995,
Bosnia-Herzegovina is split into two semi-autonomous entities, the
Serb republic and the Croat-Muslim federation.
</P>
<P>
Muslims and Croats fought each other for 11 months during the
Bosnian war, and in recent weeks tension between the two sides
have heightened over their differences in issues like the share of
power in the federation government.
</P>
<P>
The Croats argued that since Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic is
the incumbent chairman of the three-person Bosnian presidency, the
federation president should continue to be a Croat so as to keep
balance.
</P>
<P>
But the Muslims quoted the federation's Constitution as saying
that the presidency should be taken by the Croats and Muslims in
turn.
</P>
<P>
Also today, the federation's defense minister, Ante Jelavic,
said that the Croats and Muslims failed to reach an agreement on
the size of the federation army.
</P>
<P>
Jelavic, a Croat, said that the Muslims were trying to keep
more Muslim army so as to maintain a military superiority over the
Croats.

<HEADLINE> Networks to Boost Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- China's foreign trade business
and trade administration will be revolutionized with the
application of computer networks this year, China Daily reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The China International Electronic Commerce Center under the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (Moftec) will
provide China International Electronic Trade networks (CIETNet)
and platforms to promote the introduction of electronic data
interchange (EDI), the system by which computers speak easily and
efficiently to each other under a standardized structure.
</P>
<P>
Moftec Vice-Minister Liu Shanzai said EDI application is
important to upgrading the efficiency of China's foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
The center will also provide other information, including
Chinese laws and policies concerning trade and investment, and
business information at home and abroad via the networks. This can
sharpen the competitiveness of Chinese exporters and importers and
create opportunities, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Liu said from this year, laws, regulations and documents
concerning foreign trade and economic cooperation that are not
confidential will gradually be entered into CIETNet.
</P>
<P>
The center also will support office computerization of Moftec
and computer work cooperation between Moftec and other government
branches.
</P>
<P>
Liu said to improve trade administration, Moftec's short-term
goal is to use computer networks to distribute and inspect import
and export quota licences, transmit imports and exports
statistics, and supervise export tax repayment.
</P>
<P>
This step is expected to help increase foreign trade
administration efficiency and reduce illegal actions such as using
fake quota licences to gain export opportunities and cheating to
get tax repayment.

MOSCOW, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The most important task of the
Belarusian government in 1997 is to keep the momentum of economic
development gained last year, Acting Prime Minister Sergei Ling

<P>
Ling made the remarks at a meeting of the country's Association

In 1996, Belarus recorded an 2.6 percent increase in gross

Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) ended the week higher on strong
buying support on selective bluechips and the main board's second
liners.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's CPO, Tin, Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's markets of
crude palm oil (CPO), tin and rubber closed the week mixed.
</P>
<P>
CPO physicals eased this week on follow-through liquidation
activities from last week despite a pick-up in buying interest at
mid-week.
</P>
<P>
The market started bullish on Tuesday following a favorable
crop data released by the private crop forecaster, Ivan Wong whose
latest estimation figures released on Tuesday put up the January
CPO stocks at 730,000 tons and output at about 580,457 tons which
was nine percent down from the official figures of 637,865 tons.
</P>
<P>
Ivan Wong estimated exports for that month at 545,800 tons
compared with 637,899 tons for December which was officially
reported by the Palm Oil Registration and Licensing Authority
(PORLA).
</P>
<P>
However, on Thursday, market prices reversed its recent strong
position to trade lower, as players liquidated their positions on
lack of fresh news and ahead of the Lunar New year and Hari Raya
celebrations next month.
</P>
<P>
But dealers said it was enough to erase the previous gains, as
the market's overall sentiment is still on the negative territory,
which had restricted further upward pressure.
</P>
<P>
January South was traded at 1,330 ringgit (about 532 U.S.
dollars) a ton against the previous week's 1,335 ringgit (about
534 dollars) a ton.
</P>
<P>
On the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM), strong local and foreign
consumer demand and a higher London Metal Exchange (LME) led the
market to close firmer this week in active trading.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the market was quite strong with prices adding
nine sen to 14.68 ringgit (about 5.872 dollars) per kg from last
week's close of 14.59 ringgit (about 5.836 dollars) per kg.
</P>
<P>
The bullish LME, which saw base metals prices led by copper,
closing steadier across the board, spilled over to the local
market, which attracted good buying support not only from locals
but also Japanese and European investors.
</P>
<P>
The KLTM was twice unchanged on Monday and Thursday due to the
mixed sentiment on the LME. The week's high was on Tuesday when
the price surged to 14.70 ringgit (about 5.88 dollars) per kg.
</P>
<P>
The week's turnover amounted 494 tons against 582 tons last
week.
</P>
<P>
But again, prices on the Malaysian rubber market extended their
losses this week on a dull market where trading was thin.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the market was quiet as both buyers and sellers
continued with their wait-and-see-attitude.
</P>
<P>
A dealer said current prices, now seen as unattractive since
last week, had shifted the attention of most foreign buyers to the
produce in neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The bull in the rubber market seemed to have lost its steam
when International February RSS One stopped the week at 302.00 sen
(about 120.8 U.S. cents) per kg, down two sen from last week's
close of 304.00 sen (about 121.6 U.S. cents) per kg while SMR 20
dropped by 2.50 sen to 297.00 sen (about 118.8 U.S. cents) per kg.
</P>
<P>
Despite the overseas futures markets showing some positive
signs, the local front failed to receive strength to recover and
to recoup its early losses.
</P>
<P>
However, players were still holding on to market fundamentals,
hoping that there would be "huge" return of buyers after the
Chinese New Year and Moslem's Lesser Bairam (Festival of
Fast-breaking) which fall on February 7 and 9 respectively as they
rushed in to refill their requirements.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said today that Russia is in favor of integration with
its neighbor Belarus.
</P>
<P>
Primakov made the remark at a news conference held after a
meeting with his visiting Belarussian counterpart, Ivan
Antonovich, during which they discussed issues of the two
countries' integration as well as European security.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said his government agreed on the integration concept
raised by Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko, and the two
countries should accelerate the integration process especially in
the political and economic fields.
</P>
<P>
Primakov described his meeting with Antonovich as successful,
and said only countries with similar nature, purpose and
development prospects could enjoy such a relationship as between
Russia and Belarus.
</P>
<P>
Antonovich said to develop a healthy relationship with Russia
is the priority of Belarus' foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Russian-Belarussian integration should be
based on the interests of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
He also indicated that one of the steps leading to integration
is to establish a supra-state power authority.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 25 (Xinhua) -- India's Congress Party
appears to be trying to build a case for withdrawing the party's
support to the United Front minority government, the Times of
India said today.
</P>
<P>
At the Congress Parliamentary Party executive meeting here on
Friday, the government was criticized both on economic and
political fronts.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held when the relations between the Congress
Party and the United Front government are deteriorating following
a recent interrogation of Congress Party president Sitaram Kesri
by the Central Bureau of Investigation allegedly for his
inappropriate assets.
</P>
<P>
Some Congress Party members are demanding that the Congress
Working Committee (CWC), the supreme decision making body of the
party, review the party's decision to support the government and
go for fresh elections.
</P>
<P>
It is learnt that Kesri has already discussed the question of
withdrawing support with some CWC members and is expected to
consult more members in the days to come.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's new cabinet was
sworn in here today by President Ong Teng Cheong, with Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong calling for further efforts to "build a
confident and gracious society."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Swearing-In Ceremony held at the City Hall
Chamber, Goh said he intended to go the maximum distance before
calling the next General Election, due in the middle of 2002.
</P>
<P>
"This will give my team and me sufficient time to give the new
MPs the widest exposure, and to assess who among them can make it
as office holders. They will help to realize our vision of a
prosperous, cosmopolitan Singapore," he said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Goh announced his new cabinet line-up last
Saturday, 16 days after the General Election on January 2.
</P>
<P>
"Singapore was an improbable nation when it suddenly became
independent in 1965. The pre-independence generation made it
viable and successful," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pledging that his new team and he himself will now work with
the post-independence generation, to keep Singapore thriving and
vibrant into the 21st century, Goh called, "Let us build a
confident and gracious society that we are all proud of, where our
children can grow up safely to lead fulfilling lives."

<P>
SOFIA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Bulgarian National Bank
announced Friday that the middle price between the country's
currency lev and the U.S. dollar next Monday will be 813.87 to
one, marking the lev's devaluation by 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
The middle price on Friday was 731.71 leva to one dollar,
according to the country's central bank.
</P>

On Thursday's foreign currency market, the highest buying price
was 830 leva to one dollar and the highest selling price was 880
to one, but on Friday, they were 890 and 930 respectively.
</P>
<P>
The current devaluation has led to a sharp increase in
commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
While confirming that another two banks have gone bankrupt, the
national bank announced that all the commercial banks can decide
the interest rates based on the basic rates.
</P>
<P>
A former Bulgarian finance minister said a runaway inflation is
unavoidable.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Posts Trade Surplus of 5.2 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia posted a trade
surplus of 5.2 billion U.S. dollars in the first 10 months of
1996, a 72 percent increase over the same period of 1995, a senior
official said.
</P>
<P>
The trade surplus was mainly supported by the increase of
exports and the decrease of imports, Indonesian Minister of
Industry and Trade Tunky Ariwibowo said here Friday after meeting
with President Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's import growth last year only registered 4.8
percent, a significant decrease from the previous year's 30.8
percent, today's local press quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
The country's export value reached 40.6 billion dollars in the
1996 January-October period, up 10.4 percent over the same period
of 1995, he said.
</P>
<P>
The import value reached 35.3 billion dollars in the same
period, an increase of 5.1 percent over 1995. "Imports in the
whole year of 1996 only increased by 4.8 percent from 1995," he
added.
</P>
<P>
"Looking at these figures, we can say our economy is improving,
with export growth exceeding import growth," Tunky said.
</P>
<P>
As a comparison, Indonesia's exports increased by 13.39 percent
to 45.5 billion dollars in 1995 from 40 billion dollars a year
before, while imports rose by 22.9 percent to 40.6 billion dollars
from 31.98 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Talks Between Dhaka, Tribal Rebels Start Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The crucial talks between the
Bangladeshi government and the tribal leaders to end the
long-standing insurgency in Chittagong hill tracts (CHT), will
begin here today.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first meeting in the capital city between the
government and the Parbattya Chattagram Jano Sanghati Samity
(PCJSS), political wing of the CHT rebels.
</P>
<P>
The Buddhist Chakma rebels, named as Shanti Bahini, have been
fighting a bush war since 1973 for self-rule of the resource-rich
hill forests in southeast Bangladesh bordering India and Burma.
</P>
<P>
The talks will center round the five-point charter of demands
put forward by the PCJSS during the past two meetings with the
national committee, which was formed by the parliament last month.
</P>
<P>
The main demands include formation of a regional council,
envisaging a self-ruled region in the 14,200 sq. km Chittagong
hill tracts.
</P>
<P>
When contacted, a high level government source expressed his
optimism about reaching an agreement between the government and
the PCJSS during the three-day talks.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Raps Coverage in Textbooks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary
Seiroku Kajiyama today criticized the planned coverage in junior
high school textbooks of Asian women forced to provide sex for
Japanese soldiers before and during World War II.
</P>
<P>
It is odd teaching them of the comfort women issue, without
teaching the social background of an authorized prostitution
system at that time," Kyodo quoted Kajiyama as telling Japanese
reporters after a regular afternoon press conference.
</P>
<P>
"Those who are making fuss over the comfort women issue do not
know that the authorized prostitution system existed in those
days. There used to be the authorized prostitution system, as an
axiomatic one," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"When they went to the fronts, they got money. Among them,
there were some who were drafted," he added.
</P>
<P>
Experts here said that Kajiyama's remarks may have adverse
effect on the meeting between Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto and South Korean President Kim Young Sam, which is
scheduled on Saturday in Beppu, a southwestern Japanese spa.
</P>
<P>
His remarks may also provide support to some deputies in the
Diet and scholars who have long been denying the fact of "comfort
women" and insisting on eliminating the comfort women issue from
the textbooks.
</P>
<P>
Historians estimate that between 100,000 and 200,000 women,
mostly from the Korean Peninsula then under Japanese colonial
rule, were forced into sex slavery for Japanese soldiers at front
line brothels run by the Japanese military.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has recently criticized Japan for deciding to pay
solatia to former comfort women through a government-initiated
private fund, saying the compensation to those women should be
made directly by the Japanese government.
</P>
<P>
Kajiyama's stance on the comfort women question has been echoed
by some of his Liberal Democratic Party colleagues insisting that
teenage students should not be taught about the issue.
</P>
<P>
The Education Ministry in June approved the inclusion of
accounts of the "comfort women" for all seven authorized junior
high school history textbooks that will be used from next April.
</P>
<P>
In August 1993, after carrying out research on the matter, the
government announced, "In many cases they (the women) were
recruited against their will, through coaxing, coercion and so
on. At times, administrative and military personnel directly took
part in the recruitment."
</P>
<P>
"Undeniably, these were acts involving the military authorities
of the day that severely injured the honor and dignity of many
women," the government said.

<HEADLINE> Australia Seeks Thai Support for Entry into ASEM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Australia has expressed the
hope that Thailand will continue to back its efforts to join the
Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM).
</P>
<P>
Australian Ambassador to Thailand Cavan Hogue recently has sent
a message to Thai Foreign Minister Prachuab Chaiyasarn, praising
the past Thai support for Australia's efforts for entry into ASEM
and hoping that the current Thai government will maintain that
policy.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers today said that Prachuab affirmed that
Thailand will continue to back Australia's bid to join ASEM, but
Australia should be patient because the issue would need consensus
of all members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Indonesia and Malaysia are strongly opposed
to Australia's entry into ASEM, arguing it is not part of Asia.
</P>
<P>
Hogue contended that Australia see herself as part of Asia, not
just in terms of trade, but also in terms of other factors, such
as proximity, cultural relations, and ethnic mix.
</P>
<P>
Thai Foreign Ministry officials earlier said that Asian and
European senior officials had agreed that ASEM would not admit any
new members before its next gathering scheduled for 1998 in
London, stressing the issue will be considered by leaders
attending the meeting.

<P>
MELBOURNE, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Martina Hingis of Switzerland
became the youngest player to win a grand slam title for a century
after beating Mary Pierce of France in the Australian Open final
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hingis, 16, showed her superb form in the first set, building
up a lead of 5-0. Mary Pierce, the first unseeded player to enter
the Australian Open final in 19 years, made a series of unforced
errors and conceded the set 6-2.
</P>
<P>
The second set was no better for Pierce, who could not find the
touch she enjoyed in the previous rounds.
</P>
<P>
Pierce made two consecutive double-faults in the eighth game of
the second set when she was 5-2 behind. Hingis took the chance to
hit two powerful ground strokes to wrap up the set and the match
6-2.
</P>
<P>
Hingis, the fourth-seeded at the season's first grand slam
event, had promoted her world ranking to number two before the
final, just behind Steffi Graf of Germany who was eliminated by
Amanda Coetzer of South Africa in the fourth round.

<HEADLINE> South Korean President Leaves for Japan Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 25 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Young-sam left here today for Japan on a two-day working visit,
during which he will hold summit talks with Japanese Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>
During the talks to be held on Japan's southern island of
Kyushu, Kim and Hashimoto are expected to exchange views on the
coordination of policies toward the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK), the improvement of relations between Japan and
the DPRK, expanded youth exchanges and future-oriented Seoul-Tokyo
ties, including cooperation in the joint hosting of the 2002 World
Cup soccer finals.
</P>
<P>
Also to be taken up will be issues concerning the trade and
economic cooperation, a fisheries cooperation agreement, exclusive
economic zones and cooperation in the international arena like the
United Nations and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD).
</P>
<P>
However, the two leaders will not discuss the issue of
sovereignty over Tokto Island in the East Sea (Sea of Japan) and
compensation for surviving South Korean "comfort women" who were
forced to serve in military brothels for Japanese servicemen
during World War II, according to South Korean officials.
</P>
<P>
Those issues will instead be taken up in the separate meeting
between South Korean Foreign Minister Yoo Chong-ha and his
Japanese counterpart Yukihiko Ikeda.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Seoul-Tokyo relations have been hurt due
to the remarks made by Japanese officials beautifying Japan's
colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula and Japan's claim for Tokto
Island, where scores of South Korean policemen are stationed.

<HEADLINE> US Investment to Help Ease Ukraine's Economic Crisis </HEADLINE>

<P>
KIEV, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States is likely to
invest 5 to 10 billion U.S. dollars in Ukraine this year to help
ease the country's economic crisis, said a senior U.S. trade
official here today.
</P>
<P>
Young Kalitsky, the U.S. trade representative to the
Commonwealth of Independent States, said that the huge
U.S. investment will also promote Ukraine's foreign trade, the
Ukrainian News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with President Leonid Kuchma, Kalitsky said that
1997 will be a year of tremendous foreign investment in Ukraine,
as foreigners saw a low inflation in the country, which was only
0.9 percent last December.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. will also support Ukraine to enter the World Trade
Organization, Kalitsky added.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine, the third largest recipient of the U.S. aid, has
received about 1 billion dollars from Washington since its
independence in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Due to the unstable economic and political situations, Ukraine
received less than 2 billion dollars of foreign investment in the
past five years.

MEXICO CITY, January 24 (Xinhua) -- A Colombian minister today
labelled as "unjust" the statement of the U.S. Secretary of State,
who said Thursday in a letter to U.S. Congress that Mexico and
Colombia's struggles against drug trafficking were inadequate.
</P>
<P>
Jose Antonio Ocampo Gaviria, the finance minister, said in the
first annual Latin American conference that it seems uncongruous
for the United States to take such kind of attitude against the
Latin American countries.
</P>
<P>
He stressed unilateral judgments do not contribute to
international cooperation in combating drugs smuggling and must be
expurgated from international laws.
</P>
<P>
Madeleine Albright, newly designated as Secretary of State, said
Mexico must expand its cooperation with the United States in its
fight against drug trafficking and should extradite to the United
States its most wanted drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
She also threatened to recommend President Bill Clinton deny
certification to Mexican cooperation with the United States.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congress Unwilling to Pay U.N. Dues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Republican-dominated
Congress of the United States is planning to cut the U.S.
contribution to the United Nations from 25 percent to 20 percent
and fairly reduce the country's share in peacekeeping spending.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was raised by Benjamin Gilman, chairman of the
House International Relations Committee when meeting with visiting
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan Wednesday, according to local
press reports here today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. owes the U.N. 1.3 billion U.S. dollars, bringing the
world body into deep financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
However, when meeting Annan Thursday, U.S. President Bill
Clinton pledged to pay U.S. arrears to the U.N.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jesse Helms, the chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, told Annan Thursday that he will introduce
legislation, setting "benchmarks" or conditions for U.N. reform
before any funds could be paid.
</P>
<P>
Annan was made unhappy with Helms' ideas. However, he
recommended that Senate and U.N. staffs work together to identify
reform measures for the international institution.
</P>
<P>
In his remarks to the U.S. National Press Club, Annan said
Friday Washington needs to persuade the other U.N. nations if it
wants to pay less.
</P>
<P>
"The United States can negotiate a lower rate for itself, but
it must persuade other member states first," Annan said, stressing
that this is a challenge for American diplomacy, not the U.N.
secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
Major powers like Britain and France have frequently demanded
Washington pay its debt to the United Nations unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
Annan, a 58-year-old Ghanaian diplomat, arrived in Washington
Wednesday, trying to convince the U.S. administration and congress
to pay their U.N. dues.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- China's capital city of Beijing
accepted and heard 1,702 cases involving graft, embezzlement and
bribery last year, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
Ma Jianguang, vice-procurator-general of Beijing Municipal
Higher People's Procuratorate, said that Procurators at various
levels have filed charges in 836 of the cases and retrieved 285
million yuan (34.3 million US dollars) for the State and litigants.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of the Beijing Municipal People's
Political Consultative Conference, Ma said that 44 officials above
section chief level, including seven senior officials, have been
convicted or are under investigation.
</P>
<P>
Local procuratorates brought suits against 775 people and
approved public security departments arresting 430 alleged
criminals.
</P>
<P>
A survey shows there were 28 serious economic cases in the
city, each involving more than one million yuan (120,480 US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
"These cases show the success of Beijing's battle against
corruption and the enhanced awareness of the law among the people,
who actively provide valuable clues for solving the cases," Ma
said.
</P>
<P>
Ma attributed the rapid increase of corruption cases to an
imperfect supervisory system for officials and poor management in
some government departments and enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Provisional Legislative Council Enjoys Support from HK People: Zhou Nan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Zhou Nan, vice-chairman of the
Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR), said here today that the establishment of the
Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) of the Hong Kong SAR enjoys
support from the majority of the Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the first meeting of the PLC, which opened here
this morning, Zhou said that the PLC has been established on a
sound legal basis with its legal status and power originated from
relevant decisions of the Chinese National People's Congress
(NPC) and the Preparatory Committee.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the PLC has no inheritance relations with the
existing Legislative Council under the rule of the British Hong Kong
Authorities.
</P>
<P>
Zhou, also director of Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch,
said that the sole and important job for the PLC members at the
meeting is to elect the President of PLC.
</P>
<P>
One month ago, the Selection Committee for the First Government
of the Hong Kong SAR elected 60 members to form the PLC which is
to shoulder historical tasks in one year after the mid-1997
handover.
</P>
<P>
He said that high efficiency in accomplishing its heavy tasks
calls for the PLC to choose a competent leader.
</P>
<P>
Zhou expressed the belief that the PLC members will take into
account Hong Kong's overall interests and take a responsible
attitude towards the election of the PLC president.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the establishment of the PLC, Zhou said as the
British side destroyed the "through train" arrangement, it is
impossible to form the first Legislative Council of the Hong Kong
SAR under the British rule.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, there is much legislative work to be done in
the transitional period according to the Basic Law and the NPC's
decisions.
</P>
<P>
In order to avoid a legal vacuum and to ensure Hong Kong's
smooth transition and normal operation of the Hong Kong SAR, the
Preparatory Committee decided to establish the PLC before the
formation of first Legislative Council in 1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhou quoted Qian Qichen, chairman of the Preparatory Committee,
as saying at the fourth meeting of the Selection Committee held in
Shenzhen one month ago that the PLC will enact the laws
indispensable to the Hong Kong SAR and will not replace the
existing HK Legislative Council, that the laws passed by the PLC
will not go into effect till July 1, 1997, and that the PLC will
not in any way affect the rule of the Britain in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said that like the first Chief Executive of the Hong Kong
SAR, the PLC members will take oath of office on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
"But we can not say that before their taking oath of office,
the PLC members are not able to perform some necessary duties and
make preparations for legislation of the Hong Kong SAR," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that the first Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR
has the right to form the administrative bodies and Executive
Council of the Hong Kong SAR before July 1, 1997, the PLC members
also have the right to do their work.

Hun Sen will pay an official visit to Myanmar in the near future
at the invitation of the Myanmar State Law and Order Restoration

an official announcement today.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen's forthcoming visit came three months after Than Shwe's

Cambodian First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh also
came to Myanmar earlier in January last year and an agreement on
establishment of a joint commission for bilateral cooperation

</P>
<P>
Myanmar and Cambodia have strived for all-round development of
their bilateral ties of friendship and cooperation since
re-establishment of diplomatic relations in August 1994.
</P>
<P>
Both Myanmar and Cambodia are observer countries of ASEAN and
the simultaneous admittance of Myanmar into the association along

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Merapi Volcano Spews Heat Clouds Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jakarta, January 25 (Xinhua) -- after two days of insignificant
activity, Mt. Merapi, one of Indonesia's most active volcanoes,
again began spewing hot clouds early Friday.
</P>
<P>
Volcanologists stationed at the Laliurang monitoring post said
Mt. Merapi spewed heat clouds 13 times between 1:00 a.m. and 3:00
a.m. Friday, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The heat clouds moved 3,500 meters toward the Krasak river in
the southwestern part of the volcano and, although they have not
reached nearby residential areas, locals have been put on alert.
</P>
<P>
The 2,968 meter high volcano, located on the border of Central
Java and Yogyakarta, erupted on January 17, forcing the evacuation
of some 15,000 villagers.
</P>
<P>
Most of the evacuees had returned home in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, head of the Yogyakarta Volcanology Office, Mas Atje
Purbawinata, said a dome of lava continues to develop in Mt.
Merapi.
</P>
<P>
Authorities have lowered the danger status from 'alert' to
'stand-by' following the volcano's declining activities since
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The volcano could worsen any time, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The last major eruption of Merapi occurred in 1994, sending
massive heat clouds all over the area, killing 69 people and
leaving 5,000 homeless.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's 17,500 islands are dotted by about 500 volcanoes,
127 of which are active and make up the pacific rim of fire.

<HEADLINE> China Makes More Effort to Protect Wildlife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- China will exert more efforts
on protecting wildlife, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Minister of Forestry Wang Zhibao has pledged to raise
public awareness, improve the legal system, channel more funds and
work to develop infrastructures suitable for the perpetuation of
the nation's wildlife.
</P>
<P>
These endeavors are expected to confront the problems that
undermine wildlife protection, which include shrinking wetlands
and forestry areas due to land reclamation, rampant poaching and
trafficking of protected species in some areas.
</P>
<P>
China will also incorporate harsher punishments in the Penalty
Law, which is under revision and expected to become effective this
year. The new law will hopefully succeed in curtailing many of
these illegal activities, according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
With the most recent issue of wild plant protection
regulations, the ministry is now equipped with a legal and
administrative system to oversee wildlife protection.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will also try to attract more funds from domestic
and international organizations to ease the fund shortage.
</P>
<P>
It is willing to supply a few giant pandas for international
research, promote protection of worldwide and assist in the urgent
protection of some other 1,000 pandas living in the wild, the
vice-minister said.
</P>
<P>
Fund shortages have vetoed the start of the Habitat
Conservation Project for the giant panda, which needs at least 600
million yuan (72.3 million US dollars).

<HEADLINE> Ten U.S. Children Abandoned in Squalid House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Ten children were found
abandoned in a squalid crack house without water, electricity or
heat in Atlantic City, authorities said today.
</P>
<P>
The children, aged 1 to 16 years old, were found on Thursday
when a neighbor reported that the house were reeked of kerosene,
according to an Associated Press report. There were no signs that
an adult lived with them, it said.
</P>
<P>
The children were taken to Atlantic City Medical Center for
evaluation today. The relationships of the children were unclear
and they were said from Trenton, Camden or Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
They were bringing buckets of water in to use in a toilet. A
pair of bedspreads served as the back door in the two-story frame
structure. The 1-year-old was living in makeshift crib on a bed,
the report said, quoting authorities.
</P>
<P>
An aunt of at least one of the children lived down the street
and was checking on them from time to time, but no adults were
staying at the house, the report said.

<HEADLINE> New York City Outdoing Suburbs in Job Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 24 (Xinhua) -- For the first time since 1980,
New York City outdid its entire suburbs last year in making new
jobs, according to a report of the New York Times today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the United States Bureau of Labor as saying
that of the 70,000 net new private jobs added in the 27-county
region, 37,000 were in the five boroughs of New York, to that the
city has never come close in the last 17 years. Through the boom
years for job creation from 1979 to 1988, the city accounted for
only about one quarter of the one million new jobs created in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the changing balance between the growth
rates of city and suburbs to the slowed growth in suburban job
creation. New York City's private job base rose 1.3 percent in
1996, while growth in the suburban job base rose only 0.8 percent,
according to Federal figures.
</P>
<P>
The report listed two reasons for the faster job growth in the
city. One is an increasing number of international produced film
projects which found New York to be a convenient halfway point
between Hollywood and Europe for both financing and production.
6,600 new jobs were created in areas like motion picture
production. Another is the security industry, which, buoyed by the
bull market for stocks, fueled much of the city's job creation.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Dive Sharply on Weak Wall Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
retreated from Thursday's record close and all ended sharply lower
Friday, depressed by another weak performance on the Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The Dow's sharp downturn dragged the FTSE 100 index on the
London market lower in sympathy, leaving the index 52.7 points
down at 4,218.8 by the time of close after finishing at a new
record high Thursday, but still a rise of 11.1 points on last
week.
</P>
<P>
London was also unsettled by a warning from one of Britain's
major supermarket chains J. Sainsbury that 1996 profits would be
well below analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that profit-taking following Thursday's record
close compounded the downtrend.
</P>
<P>
On the Frankfurt market, which ended before Wall Street opened,
an overnight fall of the Dow and a depressed bond market helped
keep shares lower, with the DAX-30 index ending the week below the
3,000-point level, down 35.22 at 2,998.24, dropping 3.13 points on
the week.
</P>
<P>
Market sentiment in Paris also reversed today as the market
followed the general trend lower, hit by Wall Street's decline and
weaker bonds, with the CAC-40 index finishing the session 30.91
points down at 2,430.34, gaining 5.24 points on last Friday.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index of leading British shares ended 52.7
points down at 4,218.8. In Frankfurt, the DAX-30 index closed
35.22 points lower at 2,998.24. The Paris CAC-40 index finished
down 30.91 at 2,430.34.

<HEADLINE> 10 Tons of Narcotic Drugs Destroyed in Tanzania's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
destroyed about 10 tons of narcotic drugs, which were impounded
at the Dar Es Salaam port last year, at Wazo Hill Cement Factory
in the city today.
</P>
<P>
A 40-foot container containing the contraband was opened and
burnt under tight security by armed Field Force Unit (FFU)
men.
</P>
<P>
The Director of Criminal Investigations (DCI), Adadi Rajabu,
said the police has offered a special reward to any person who
gives a tip for having the three suspects of drug traffickers
arrested.
</P>
<P>
He said the three suspects are two Tanzanians named Andrew
Mtegeki (a private pilot) and Abduh Awadhi respectively and a
South African identified as Paulos Palma.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian police had arrested Awadhi on charge of drug
smuggling and had him sentenced to three years imprisonment, but
finally Awadhi won an appeal and was set free.
</P>
<P>
"Any person who will give us the right information to find the
suspects will get a huge reward but if one will be found to have
been concealing, (he) shall be held accountable," Rajabu said.
</P>
<P>
The contraband was intercepted by police at Dar es Salaam port
last February. It was shipped in 150 bags of tea from Nakonde,
Zambia, to Ukraine aboard MV Afro Asia Star.
</P>
<P>
The origin of the drug was still unknown. But some of the
papers in which the narcotic drugs were wrapped read, "Fancy
Cutchup, Made in USA for exclusive use by MC Donald
Restraunts".
</P>
<P>
The Zambian police have found 7.97 tons of cannabis resin
worth 30 billion Tanzania Shillings (about 50 million U.S.
Dollars) and 1.94 tons of heroin valued at 20 billion T.Shs.
(about 33 million Dollars) since last February.

<HEADLINE> Albright Stresses Importance on NATO Enlargement, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. new Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said today that NATO's enlargement was
essential and keeping good relationship with Russia is paramount
to U.S. interests.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that it is essential to enlarge NATO," Albright
said at her first news conference as secretary. "We understand
that the Russians have some problems with that. But what is clear
is that both countries are committed to working this situation out
and developing mutual understanding based on our national
interests."
</P>
<P>
She stressed the importance of U.S.-Russian relations. "I think
it is very important as we look at our agenda over the next years
to understand that our relationship with Russia, a good
relationship with the Russian Federation is paramount to our
interests," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said good relations between the two countries were also
important to the international community.
</P>
<P>
The United States and its alliance have met Russia's opposition
to NATO's eastern-ward expansion, as Russia sees the expansion as a
threat to its national security.
</P>
<P>
The United States has repeatedly stated that NATO's plan of
enlargement would not be stopped by any outside power, but at the
same time, the U.S. and its alliance are trying to calm the
Russians and talk the latter into accepting the idea.
</P>
<P>
Albright said a meeting set for February in Washington between
high-level U.S. and Russian officials would go forward, despite
Russian President Boris Yeltsin's recent health problems.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Clinton were scheduled to hold a summit meeting in
March. NATO's enlargement is expected as one of the top topics at
the meetings.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi "Escrow Account" Expected to Reach 200 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 24 (Xinhua) -- An escrow account
holding the proceeds from sale of Iraqi oil is expected to reach
200 million U.S. dollars by Monday, a U.N. spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
The account at the New York branch of the Banque Nationale de
Paris was opened under an oil-for-food deal that became effective
on December 10. The deal allows Iraq to sell 2 billion U.S.
dollars of oil over six months to buy humanitarian supplies to
help relieve the suffering of the people caused by the sanctions
imposed since 1990.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that so far, 53.1 million U.S. dollars has
been disbursed from the account, including 33.9 million U.S.
dollars for the Geneva-based U.N. compensation commission that
rules on reparations for victims of the Iraqi invasion. The
remainder went for various other U.N. activities related to the
war. Under the oil-for-food deal, thirty percent of the proceeds
fo the Iraqi oil sales are earmarked for reparations.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Security Council's Iraqi sanctions committee,
which monitors exports to Iraq, approved on Thursday a 50 million
U.S. dollars' sale of Australian wheat and about 21 million U.S.
dollars' sale of rice from Thailand. The committee is still
considering a proposed sale to Iraq of detergent powder from
Vietnam.
