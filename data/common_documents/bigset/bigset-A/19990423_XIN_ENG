<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Special Envoy on
Cyprus Diego Cordovez had resinged after two years of service at
the post, the U.N. announced here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan had agreed to relieve Cordovez of his responsibility with
regard to Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Ekchard did not give any reason for the envoy's resignation.
</P>
<P>
Cordovez, a former Ecuadoran foreign minister, would remain
available to the secretary-general as a special adviser, primarily
on Latin American issues, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Alternative arrangements would be made to support Annan, as
necessary, in his efforts to help bring about a settlement in
Cyprus, Eckhard added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been virtually partitioned since 1974 when Turkish
troops took over the north of the island in reaction to a coup in
Nicosia engineered by the junta then ruling Greece.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has been trying over the decades to reunite
Cyprus under a federal system of government.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak: Palestinians Unlikely to Declare Statehood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
said on Thursday that it is unlikely the Palestinians will declare
independence on May 4 so as to avoid complicating the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
"I think the Palestinians will take the right decision so as
not to cause more problems" in the current situation of the peace
process, Mubarak told reporters after a meeting with Israeli
President Ezer Weizman, who arrived here earlier in the day for a
one-day visit. Weizman returned home after the talks.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, who discussed with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
Wednesday the latest developments of the peace process, said the
Palestinian stand will become clear when their decision-making
Palestinian Central Council meets on Tuesday to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has said that he would declare an independent
Palestinian state on May 4 when the five-year interim Palestinian
autonomy under the Oslo accord signed with Israel in 1993 expires.
</P>
<P>
Many countries have recognized Palestinians' right to
statehood, but they have advised Arafat to postpone carrying out
his plan until after Israel's general elections on May 17.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has voiced its support for the Palestinian right to
declare statehood, whether on May 4 or on a later date.
</P>
<P>
Weizman, an advocate of the Mideast peace process, expressed
optimism about the peacemaking march.
</P>
<P>
He said that he is "personally optimistic" although the peace
process is "unfortunately stalled" and "not in a healthy
situation."
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with
Israel in 1979. Weizman was then deeply involved in the peace
talks with Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Africa Meeting on Child Soldiers Ends in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Conference on Use of Children
as Soldiers in Africa ended here Thursday, urging governments and
armed opposition groups in the continent not to use children as
soldiers in conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The four-day conference adopted a 15-point Maputo Declaration
on Use of Children as Soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The declaration says that it is absolutely unacceptable for any
military force or armed group to recruit children under 18 years
of age as soldiers even when the children claim that they are
willing.
</P>
<P>
It also demands that all children serving in the armed forces
should be demilitarized and sent to safe places.
</P>
<P>
Governments of African states are asked to ensure that the
released child soldiers recover physically and psychologically and
are really reintegrated into the society.
</P>
<P>
According to the declaration, those who continue to recruit or
use children as soldiers should be brought to book.
</P>
<P>
The conference was hosted by the Mozambican Ministry of Social
Action Co- ordination, focusing on such issues as the use of
children as soldiers and the reintegration of these children into
society.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that there are at least 300,000 children under
18 years of age involved in armed conflicts around the world.

<HEADLINE> Macedonian Parties: No NATO Ground Attack From Macedonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Macedonian political parties
Wednesday reaffirmed their common position that no NATO ground
offensive against Yugoslavia will be allowed to be carried out
from Macedonian soil.
</P>
<P>
The Macedonian news agency MIA reported Thursday that the
Macedonian parliamentary parties made the reaffirmation in a
meeting with Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov.
</P>
<P>
"The territory of the Republic of Macedonia should not be used
for an offensive against any neighboring country, including
Yugoslavia, in the case of a possible ground action taken by
NATO," said the report, which was monitored here.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the parliamentary parties discussed the
political situation in the country, the issue of Kosovo refugees
and Macedonia's integration in the Euro-Atlantic structures.
</P>
<P>
They urged the European Union and NATO countries to take a much
more active part in receiving the Kosovo refugees who fled the war
in the southern Serb province.
</P>
<P>
The European countries should also provide more material and
financial aid for Macedonia, which has sheltered more than 130,000
Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
They repeated their consensus about Macedonia's desire for an
EU and NATO membership.
</P>
<P>
"There were no great differences in opinion on the questions
discussed. I think that all the parties left the meeting with a
strong sensation of soberness and responsibility," the leader of
the Socialist Party, Ljubisav Ivanov, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said, "At this moment, we need to be united on all the
questions so that we can pull the country out of this difficult
situation."
</P>
<P>
President of the Social-Democratic Alliance of Macedonia Branko
Crvenkovski expressed his party's firm opposition to the use of
Macedonian territory for a ground assault against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"This is not the Middle Ages, which would mean that the front
line is 100 or 200 meters wide, rather, it is completely clear
that all the military operations and activities would be led from
and toward the entire Macedonian territory," he argued.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Pays Attention to Harmful Traditional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- An Ethiopian minister
Thursday emphasized on the need to raise public awareness as a
useful means to quell harmful traditional practises.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Minister of Women's Affairs in the Prime Minister's
Office, Tadelech Hailemichael, said that the Ethiopian government
has issued women, population, health, educational and social
policies to do away with harmful traditional practices.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian News Agency quoted her as saying that female
genital mutilation is the major practise detrimental to women.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of a three-day meeting organized here
by the National Committee on Traditional Practises, the minister
said that her office in close collaboration with other pertinent
institutions is endeavoring to circumvent the harmful practises.
</P>
<P>
She described as "useful" the strategy based on a study made on
harmful traditions practised among 65 nationalities throughout the
Horn of Africa country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same function, Bogalech Alemu, chairwoman of
the committee, said that her organization has waged campaign
against such harmful practises as female genital mutilation,
earlier marriage and abduction.
</P>
<P>
The committee is endeavoring to give protection to women,
children and the elderly, she added.

<HEADLINE> Czech Deputy Premier in Cyprus to Boost Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Czech Deputy Prime Minister Egon
Lansky arrived here Thursday for a 10-day official visit to boost
bilateral ties and discuss issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Lansky said upon his arrival at Larnaca airport that there is a
wide scope for improving relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said he will meet President Glafcos Clerides, Foreign
Minister Ioannis Kasoulides and political party leaders to discuss
"a number of common issues," such as accession to the European
Union (EU) and development in southeastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Slovenia and
Cyprus have been listed as candidates for immediate EU
membership. The entry talks started early last year.
</P>
<P>
Asked about Czech position on Yugoslav crisis, Lansky said "we
are fresh member of NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization),
which makes us committed to the case NATO has been making in
Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
He said he has recently visited Albania and the refugees there,
and found that "suffering is terrible for people, no matter what
nationality, ethnic group or religion they belong to."
</P>
<P>
NATO began air strikes against Yugoslavia March 24 after the
Serb-led government refused to accept a deal, which requires
Belgrade to grant autonomy to the independence-seeking ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees have since fled
to neighboring Macedonia and Albania.
</P>
<P>
Lansky said the Czech Republic will offer the refugees
humanitarian aid.

<HEADLINE> Poor People More Likely to Die in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of poor people are dying
from cancer because they do not have the same chances as the rich,
according to the first major study of cancer and socio-economic
factors released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Cancer Research Campaign (CRC) says more than 12,700 deaths
could have been avoided in patients diagnosed between 1986 and
1990 if inequalities in cancer care did not exist in England and
Wales.
</P>
<P>
Research suggests that the reasons may be that poorer patients
go to the doctor when their cancer is more advanced, have worse
overall health than the rich, worse access to treatment and are
less likely to comply with treatment.
</P>
<P>
They also tend to get more aggressive forms of cancer, possibly
because of poor diet and because they are more likely to smoke.
</P>
<P>
The report, by the Office for National Statistics, the CRC and
the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, also shows
that men have a worse survival rate than women for many cancers,
including bowel cancer, leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
</P>
<P>
Professor Gordon McVie, director general of the CRC, said:
"This report highlights what appears to be a catalogue of terrible
injustices -- we cannot afford to rest until they are remedied."
</P>
<P>
It studied 3 million adults and 18,000 children in England and
Wales who had been diagnosed with cancer between 1971 and 1990 and
followed their progress until 1995.
</P>
<P>
It found that the disparity in survival rates between rich and
poor was between 5 percent and 16 percent for 14 adults cancers,
including breast, bowel and malignant melanoma.
</P>
<P>
The rich were 16 percent more likely than the poor to survive
for five years after getting tongue cancer.
</P>
<P>
The more affluent also had a 5 percent higher chance of
survival for seven other cancers, such as lung, prostate, ovarian
and cervical cancer, the report says.
</P>
<P>
The CRC says more than 2,800 breast cancer deaths, more than
2,300 bowel cancer deaths and more than 1,300 lung cancer deaths
could be avoided if all people had equal chances of survival.

PARIS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- National Secretary of the French
Communist Party Robert Hue proposed Thursday that France take the
initiative to set up a "force of security and cooperation" for
Kosovo under the guide of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the daily Aujourd'hui/Le Parisien, Hue
said that such a force should be put under the auspices of the
United Nations and have the mission of ensuring the return of
Kosovars to their country and protecting them in a demilitarized
zone.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his satisfaction that President Jacques Chirac
refused to give his support to the idea of a NATO ground
intervention in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He also accused the United States of trying to "force the hand
of its allies" to do something.
</P>
<P>
The French Communist Party has expressed its strong opposition
to the NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia and called for a
political solution to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In his televised speech Wednesday, Chirac did not mention the
possibility of a NATO ground intervention in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Teachers' Union Calls for Woodhead Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- A headteachers' union voted
Thursday to ask the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) to hold
a criminal probe into whether England's Chief Inspector of Schools
Chris Woodhead lied on oath.
</P>
<P>
The national council of the National Association of Head
Teachers voted by 33 to two, with one abstention, to follow the
course of action recommended by its General Secretary David Hart.
</P>
<P>
The union called on Education Secretary David Blunkett to
submit to the DPP evidence he has received from Woodhead's former
wife.
</P>
<P>
The move relates to an affidavit signed by Woodhead stating
that he and Amanda Johnston did not begin their nine-year
relationship until after both had left Gordano School near
Bristol, where he was an English teacher and she was a sixth
former student more than 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
But the chief inspector's former wife, Cathy, said her
ex-husband had an affair with Johnston while both were still at
the school.
</P>
<P>
Woodhead, who heads the Office for Standards in Education
(Ofsted), accused the union of hating him for his forthright
statements on what he sees as the failings of the education
system.
</P>
<P>
"The teacher unions have been trying to get rid of me since I
was appointed. The NAHT's action today is their latest attempt,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Says Visit to Syria Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin
Hussein returned home Thursday after a two-day official visit to
Syria aimed at mending ties affected by the 1994 peace treaty
between Jordan and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Briefing reporters here, Abdullah said his talks with Syrian
President Hafez Al-Assad were successful and constructive in
consolidating bilateral ties and for coordination on regional
issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian officials accompanying Abdullah during the visit said
both Jordan and Syria pinned great hope on the strengthening of
bilateral cooperation in economy, trade and water issues.
</P>
<P>
Most analysts here believed Abdullah`s visit to Damascus
officially end an unhappy episode between the two countries which
was triggered by the 1994 peace treaty between Jordan and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Israel are still at war and troops from the two
countries are still exchanging fire sporadically over the
strategically located Golan Heights, captured by Israel in the
1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Assad had been at odds with late Jordanian King Hussein Ibn
Talal over Jordan`s peace peace treaty with Israel before Hussein
died of cancer on February 7.
</P>
<P>
However, Assad paid a surprise visit to Amman in years to
attend the funeral of Hussein on February 8 and declared a
three-day mourning period in Syria for the late Jordanian ruler.
</P>
<P>
Assad`s olive branch to Amman was well received by the
Jordanian government, which has expressed support for Syria`s
conditions to resume peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Damascus hoped to resume its peace talks with Israel from
where it was suspended before Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu came to power in 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu wanted to restart the peace talks on new
grounds, a stand rejected by Syria as unwilling to carry out the
land-for-peace arrangement by the former Israeli Labor government
to withdraw Israeli troops from the Golan Heights.

ADDIS ABABA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's Ministry of Health
 announced Thursday that last year's national vaccination coverage
is far less than those carried out in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
Mekonnen Admassu, vaccination program coordinator of the
ministry, said vaccination coverage has dwindled from 69 percent
in 1996 and 1997 respectively to only 58 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a national vaccination campaign promotion meeting
held in Nazareth, some 90 kms away from Addis Ababa, Mekonnen said
that "the low performance is due to budgetary, material and
manpower constraints," the Ethiopian News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is aimed at evaluating difficulties encountered in
the past, in order to raise the national vaccination coverage to
75 percent.
</P>
<P>
Over nine million children were vaccinated against polio in two
rounds of immunization campaigns conducted across the nation last
year, according to an earlier announcement made by the ministry.

<P>
BEIRUT, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Amid anti-corruption drive
against figures of former government of Rafik Hariri, Lebanon's
former Director of Antiquities at the Ministry of Culture and
Education, Camille Asmar, was detained Thursday on charges of
squandering and embezzlement of public funds.
</P>
<P>
Another three employees at the ministry were also held on
the same charges under the order issued by Judge Khaled
Hammound, the country's public prosecutor for financial fraud.
</P>
<P>
The detention came after the prosecutor questioned 75 people
concerning the missing artifacts case that was first unveiled last
month.
</P>
<P>
Some 14,000 artifacts, missing when Asmar was in office, have
been recovered in a series of raids on businessmen and
politicians' houses and stores across the country.
</P>
<P>
Asmar was the second highest ranking official to be arrested in
the anti-corruption drive launched by the four-month-old regime of
President Emile Lahoud and Prime Minister Salim Hoss.
</P>
<P>
Former Oil Minister Shahe Barsomian has been arrested on
charges of embezzlement of public funds, corruption and forgery
of documents. He was the first former minister to be held in the
history of Lebanon since its independence in 1943.
</P>
<P>
Also, the State Audit Department accused Hariri and three of

About 40,000 people will die each year between next year and

<HEADLINE> EU Planning To Impose Oil Sanctions On FRY </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) is
planning to impose oil supply sanctions on the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia (FRY) as 15 EU foreign ministers are expected to meet
in Luxembourg early next week for a final decision.
</P>
<P>
However, the EU member states are still divided on such
sanctions. EU sources here said that France believes a total
embargo would prove difficult to implement given the absence of a
U.N. mandate for such a move and the fact that war has not been
officially declared against the FRY.
</P>
<P>
Other EU member states such as Italy and Greece, both members
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), are thought to
be opposed to further sanctions, the EU sources confirmed.
</P>
<P>
The United States is also calling for a blockade of the FRY's
oil imports. Meanwhile, France has suggested that supplies be
"restricted" and not entirely "cut off" through an EU decision
bringing in countries bordering the FRY, notably Hungary, Romania
and Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed an arms embargo on the FRY in 1998,
with the EU imposing further sanctions, including a ban on new
investment and an air embargo, later last year.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, German Chancellor and acting EU president Gerhard
Schroder called for pressure to be increased on the FRY which is
continuing to receive oil through ports in Montenegro and via an
oil pipeline through Hungary, while NATO forces fear risking their
lives in face of strong resistance by Serb forces.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Calls for Good Governance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
Thursday challenged local government authorities to promote
openness and eliminate corruption for good governance.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening a four-day biennial congress of the
Association of Rural District Councils in Mutare of east Zimbabwe,
Mugabe said, "Good governance is essentially a process of
involving people in the making of decisions which affect their
livelihood in a transparent and accountable manner."
</P>
<P>
Mugabe added local authorities should play a central and active
role in the promotion of local economic development, the Zimbabwe
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"I want to challenge local governments represented here to
develop innovative strategies to reverse the growing poverty in
their areas by widening and strengthening the income-generating
conditions of the people," he said.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the congress attended by representatives of 57
rural district councils throughout the country is "future of local
governments under reformed environment".
</P>
<P>
Mugabe stressed, "Each council must aim at creating an
efficient and effective service delivery through improved
management and personnel systems."
</P>
<P>
He said the decentralization program which was being
implemented by the government was also aimed at promoting
democracy and good local governance.

<HEADLINE> Romania Extradites PKK Members to Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Romania extradited over 30
members of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) to Turkey
over the last four months, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The news agency quoted Turkish officials as saying that those
who were extradited had no jobs in Romania, adding that "PKK
members who have jobs continue their activities with ease."
</P>
<P>
Romania has been among the countries where the activities of
PKK rebels are active.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that Romania extradites all persons who have links
with the PKK organization," said an official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a guerrilla war since August 1984 for
an independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey. The conflict
has claimed over 37,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
The guerrilla organization suffered a serious setback when its
leader, Abdullah Ocalan, was captured by Turkish special agents in
Kenya in mid-February.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan has been detained on Imrali Island in Marmara Sea near
Turkey's western province of Bursa for trial on charges of
treason.

<TEXT>
<P>
Abdi Musa Assir and Hussein Mohamed Ossobleh , the districts
commissioners of Galhareri and EI-Dher, said the districts are
being devastated by lack of water which had claimed the lives of
more than 7,090 head of cattle, goats, camels and donkeys in the
past two months, which are the bread-earners for many Somalis.
</P>
<P>
Ossobleh said a barrel of water is sold for shillings 20, 000
(about 2.5 U.S. dollars), which is beyond the affordability of
most of the people. The price of sorghum and maize, the staple
food in the country, has risen to shillings 200,000 for each
50-kilogram bag.
</P>
<P>
The local authorities said that unless something quick is done,
hundreds of people on the brink of total starvation may be
endangered.
</P>
<P>
The authorities said severe diarrhea and measles are also
accompanying the famine and water scarcity.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the situations are worsening with the
number of people and livestock dying of diseases and starvation
increasing by the day in the neighboring regions of Bakol, Bay
and Galgudud.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 people have died of diseases there in the past
three weeks.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Civilian Killed in U.S.-British Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 22 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi civilian was killed and
four others injured Thursday in U.S.-British air raids on both
civilian and military targets, an Iraqi military spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed spokesman announced in a statement that 10
formations of "enemy warplanes" coming from Turkish airbase
violated northern Iraqi airspace over Erbil, Dohuk and Mosul
provinces at 14:05 (1005 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The planes bombed civilian facilities and military sites in the
region, leading to one death and four injuries, the spokesman
said, quoted by the Iraqi News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He added that Iraqi air defenses fired back and forced the
enemy planes to flee at 17:35 (1335 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Thirteen formations of U.S.-British warplanes coming from Saudi
and Kuwaiti bases also violated southern Iraqi airspace at 11:00
(0700 GMT) over Samawa, Nasiriya and Basra provinces, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Since the mid-December U.S. and British air strikes against
Iraq, clashes between U.S. and British jets patrolling the no-fly
zones and the Iraqi air defenses have almost become daily
occurrences.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led Western allies imposed the no-fly zones in Iraq
following the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting the
Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from
"Baghdad's suppression."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has refused to acknowledge the restricted zones and vowed
to continue confronting any allied planes violating its airspace.

<HEADLINE> Aid Urged for Capacity-Building in Developing Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- China Thursday urged the
international community to support developing countries' efforts
for capacity-building for sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by Minister of China's State Environmental
Protection Administration Xie Zhenhua at a session of the U.N.
Commission for Sustainable Development.
</P>
<P>
Xie said China does not support any move which will go beyond
the capability and the development level of developing countries,
and will yield negative impact on their economic development and
trade.
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, it does not support such undifferentiated
practices as environmental cost internalization in international
trade and use of eco-labeling to limit the market access of the
products from developing countries.
</P>
<P>
He said developing countries should build their capacity to
gradually incorporate the sustainable production and consumption
pattern into their policy-making and implementation process.
</P>
<P>
He also urged developed nations to change their pattern of
unsustainable production and consumption.
</P>
<P>
With a population accounting for 24 percent of the world total,
developed countries consume 75 percent of global natural
resources, he said.
</P>
<P>
Such a long-standing luxury and wasterful consumption pattern
built on the basis of overconsumption of natural resources, has
yielded substantially negative impacts on the global environment,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Xie urged developed nations to bear more responsibilities for
marine environment protection as they are main users and
beneficiaries of the marine resources.
</P>
<P>
They should fulfill their commitments by providing financial
resources and transferring the environmentally sound technologies
to developing countries to strengthen their capacity to prevent
marine pollution from land-based activities, he said.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Members Urged to Back Cross-Border Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Member States in the Common Market
for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) have been urged to
support cross border traders and do not treat them as smugglers .
</P>
<P>
COMESA Trade and Customs Committee made the appeal in its
fourth meeting which ended here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that despite their important role in economic
development, cross border traders are often treated as smugglers
or are not trusted at customs.
</P>
<P>
Apart from finding difficulties in obtaining passports, the
traders have to pay higher import duties and value added tax.
</P>
<P>
Some countries set up trade bans without noticement in advance
and impound traders' goods .
</P>
<P>
The meeting urged COMESA states to boost their export to other
member countries with small cross-border business and encouraged
small border traders to form their own associations.
</P>
<P>
The governments would earn foreign exchange as well as other
forms of revenue if cross-border traders are allowed to operate
freely, the report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- King Abdullah Bin Hussein ended
his first, two-day visit to Syria as Jordan's monarch and left
here this evening.
</P>
<P>
He was seen off at the Damascus International Airport by Syrian
President Hafez Al-Assad and other top officials.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Abdullah held four sessions of talks
Assad, which centered on Arab, regional and international
situations as well as ways of achieving solidarity and boosting
cooperation and coordination among the Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to deal with the bilateral ties with the
spirit of fraternity and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah's visit to Syria is the first of its kind since he
ascended the throne in February in the wake of father King
Hussein's death on February 7.
</P>
<P>
The visit turned a new page in the bilateral ties between the
two countries which had long been at odds. Syria has territorial
dispute with Israel while Jordan is one of the two Arab states
that have peace treaty with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Jordanian relations improved steadily since Assad
went to Jordan attending funeral of Hussein, who died of lymphatic
cancer.
</P>
<P>
Bashar, Assad's son, visited Jordan later. Assad and Abdullah
have since exchanged friendly messages on various national
occasions of their two countries.

<HEADLINE> UNAIDS: Funding of AIDS Efforts Not Keeping Pace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Wealthy countries' level
of support for the international fight against AIDS is being
vastly outpaced by the epidemic, a U.N. report said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report, prepared by the Joint United Nations Program on
HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), said the donor nations provide approximately
350 million U.S. dollars a year for an epidemic that has already
infected 47 million people and grows by nearly 6 million new
infections annually.
</P>
<P>
The report examined donor spending on national, regional and
international efforts to address HIV/AIDS, and national HIV/AIDS
spending among developing countries for the year 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
The report found that among industrialized countries, the
United States is the largest funder of the international AIDS
program, contributing 135.2 million dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
But when AIDS funding is broken down as a proportion of gross
national product, the Netherlands and Norway rank first and second
respectively, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report indicated that AIDS funding has not suffered the
same declines as overall development assistance during the past
few years. However, the amount allocated for HIV/AIDS has remained
small -- less than 1 percent of donor countries' annual Official
Development Assistance budgets.

NAIROBI, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Somalia Aid Coordination Body
(SACB) Thursday strongly condemned the kidnapping of an Italian
veterinarian in Xaaga District, Lower Juba Region in Somalia on
April 16, 1999.
</P>
<P>
An official from the SACB Nairobi Office told Xinhua that the
name of the kidnapped was withheld for the time being.
</P>
<P>
The SACB, comprising donors, U.N. agencies and international
non- governmental organizations (NGOs), demanded the relevant
local authorities to act responsibly to release the veterinarian
"immediately and unconditionally".
</P>
<P>
The veterinarian works with the Terra Nuova, an Italian aid
agency, which operates in Lower Juba Region in treating the
livestock, according to sources from Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the gunmen, holding the Italian doctor 17
 kilometers south of Afmadow Town in the region, were demanding an
unspecified amount of money for his release.
</P>
<P>
"The SACB called on local authorities to make immediate action
to apprehend and bring to justice the perpetrators of this
abhorrent act,"  the SACB said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Until such time as an appropriate action has been taken by
competent authorities and justice has been carried out, the SABC
recommends that U.N. agencies, international NGOs and other
international organizations suspend their activities in the Lower
Juba Region," the statement added.

<HEADLINE> Court Hearing of GITIC Bankruptcy Case Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The court hearing into China's
first case of liquidation and bankruptcy of a financial
institution - the Guangdong International Trust and Investment
Corp. (GITIC)- ended here today after the first creditor meetings
finished.
</P>
<P>
A total of 328 domestic and 116 overseas creditors attended the
three-day meetings, accounting for about 82 percent of registered
creditors involved in the case, according to the Higher People's
Court of Guangdong Province, which called the hearings, together
with the Shenzhen Intermediate Court and the Guangzhou
Intermediate Court.
</P>
<P>
"The liquidation committee appointed by the court has invited
world famous accountancy and legal firms to handle the liquidation
work using the principles of authority and fairness, and in a bid
to fully protect the rights and interests of the creditors," Li Qi,
deputy director of the Guangdong Provincial Higher People's court,
told a press conference this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The international accountancy firm, KPMG Peat Marwick Huazhen
has been entrusted to handle the entire liquidation work after
GITIC was obliged to cease operating last October by the People's
Bank of China, the country's central bank, said a representative
of the firm.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong-based law firm, Johnson Stokes &AMP; Marter, and the
Guangdong Kinsson Law Firm have been in charge of handling the
overseas and domestic legal affairs of GITIC.
</P>
<P>
The work to recover the overseas debts of GITIC has been
completed, with 29.33 million yuan (3.58 million U.S. dollars)
recovered and seven million stock rights currently blocked,
according to the court.
</P>
<P>
GITIC, the investment arm of booming Guangdong Province, was
closed because of its inability to meet outstanding debts. It had
assets of 21.47 billion yuan (2.6 billion dollars) but debts
amounting to 36.15 billion yuan (4.3 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The board of directors of the company applied for bankruptcy on
January 11, this year.
</P>
<P>
GITIC's liquidation proceedings will be handled in four parts,
according to GITIC's assets which are divided among its four
companies: GITIC headquarters, Guangxin Enterprise Co., GITIC
Shenzhen Co. Ltd. and Guangdong International Leasing Co. Ltd..

<HEADLINE> U.N. Urges Wealthy States to Provide More for Global Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Joint United Nations Program
on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) has urged the wealthy countries to provide
more fund for the international fight against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Wealthy countries' level of support for the prevention of AIDS
has been vastly outpaced by the epidemic, the UNAIDS said in a
report released here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Weighed against the global catastrophe of the AIDS epidemic,
the level of spending for HIV prevention around the world is
minimal," said UNAIDS Executive Director Peter Piot.
</P>
<P>
Donor nations provide about 350 million U.S. dollars a year for
an epidemic that has already infected 47 million people and grows
by nearly 6 million new infections annually, according to the
UNAIDS report.
</P>
<P>
"Donor nations must realize that their substantial investments
toward improving conditions in developing countries will be
effectively obliterated unless more is invested in fighting AIDS,
the single greatest threat to global development today," said
Piot.
</P>
<P>
The report found that between 1990 and 1997, when the number of
people living with HIV more than tripled, from approximately 9.8
million to 30.3 million, HIV/AIDS funding rose only from 165
million dollars to 273 million.
</P>
<P>
"Twenty years into the epidemic, it is alarming that AIDS is
expanding three times faster than the funding to control it," said
Piot.
</P>
<P>
Although AIDS funding has not suffered the same declines as
overall development assistance (ODA) during the past few year, the
UNAIDS indicated, the amount allocated for HIV/AIDS has remained
small, less than 1 percent of donor countries' annual ODA budgets.

<HEADLINE> Ivanov Calls for Diplomatic Solution in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov said Thursday that Russia firmly opposes
possible use of ground troops by NATO against Yugoslavia,
stressing that the conflict must be resolved by diplomatic means.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting his Israeli counterpart
Ariel Sharon, Ivanov also urged Israel to implement peace
agreements signed with the Palestinians and resume talks with
Syria.
</P>
<P>
Asked how Russia will react if NATO decides to send ground
forces to Kosovo, Ivanov replied with anger, "any step like this
will escalate the conflict."
</P>
<P>
Russia is trying to do everything it can to ensure that a
diplomatic solution will be found to the crisis in the Balkans, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Russia has strongly opposed the NATO bombing campaign against
Yugoslavia, which has entered its fourth week, and has tried to
mediate between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov's remarks came amid reports that NATO leaders will make
decisions on whether to use ground troops to intensify their
strike against Yugoslavia when they meet in Washington Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign minister, who arrived in Israel Thursday
at the start of a Middle East tour, also urged Israel and the
Palestinians to do everything possible to re-start the stalled
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Citing alleged Palestinian violations, Israel has halted a
phased transfer of land in the West Bank which was stipulated in
the Wye agreement signed last October.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said other tracks of the peace process, including the
Israeli-Syrian and Israeli-Lebanese talks, all depend on the
progress of the Israeli-Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said earlier that the main task of his
visit to Israel is to discuss ways to move forward the whole
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
At the briefing, Sharon denied a newspaper report that Israel
has sent Damascus a message expressing willingness to resume the
talks from where they were left off in early 1996.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the government position that Israel would not
withdraw from the Golan Heights, the Syrian territory seized by
Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Syria says that the former Labor government of Israel had
promised to withdraw from the whole Golan in talks before they
broke off. But the Likud Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denied
the existence of such a promise.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov will meet Friday with Netanyahu and his two main rivals
in the May elections: leader of One Israel Ehud Barak and Center
Party leader Yitzhak Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
He will also meet Palestinian National Authority Chairman
Yasser Arafat before flying on to Cairo. He is due to visit
Damascus Saturday.

<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Governments at all levels have
been asked to help find jobs for some 81,000 military personnel in
the civilian sector this year.
</P>
<P>
Yu Yongbo, a member of the Central Military Commission and
director of the General Political Department of the People's
Liberation Army, said at a seminar here today that officials at
all levels should try their best to help military staff transfer
to civil work and strengthen cooperation between the army and
local governments.
</P>
<P>
Some 50,000 officers from the army and their 16,000 family
members had such arrangements made for them by local governments
last year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Steel Imports Up 25 Percent in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States' steel
imports rose 25 percent to 2.5 million tons in March from the 2
million tons in February, reversing a four-month trend of decline,
according to the preliminary figures released by the Commerce
Department Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Still, the total represented a 30 percent drop from November,
the department said.
</P>
<P>
Steel shipments from Japan and Brazil, two of the chief targets
of the U.S. industry's trade complaints, recorded a one-month
increase of 39 percent and 54 percent, respectively. Russia, which
has tentatively agreed to reduce future shipments to the United
States, posted a 53 percent reduction in March.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, South Korea and Taiwan also posted increases.
</P>
<P>
The imports are blamed for thousands of layoffs and
bankruptcies at three U.S. companies. They resulted from the Asian
economic crisis, which lowered demand for steel abroad and forced
foreign producers to increasingly rely on U.S. markets.
</P>
<P>
The latest steel numbers are likely to add fuel to industry
arguments that despite preliminary U.S. rulings threatening
punitive tariffs on hot-rolled carbon steel from Japan, Russia and
Brazil, those countries could simply shift to other products.
</P>
<P>
The industry has been seeking even tougher sanctions. Last
month, the House overwhelmingly passed a quota bill despite the
threat of a presidential veto.
</P>
<P>
Steel workers, a key ally of Democrats, have been vocal about
demanding quotas.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Britain Oppose Sending Ground Troops to Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Britain
Thursday reaffirmed opposition to deploying ground troops in
Kosovo in a hostile environment.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook made the statement amid reports that NATO is
considering sending ground troops to invade Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"We do not favor the deployment of ground troops into a hostile
environment in Kosovo," Albright told a news conference with Cook
at her side.
</P>
<P>
Cook said, "We are not going to commit ground forces in a
hostile environment, nor do we need to. Time is our greatest
ally."
</P>
<P>
Albright said the allies were confident that a sustained and
relentless NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia could achieve the
objectives of forcing the withdrawal of Serb forces from Kosovo
and the return of ethnic Albanian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a separate briefing, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth
Bacon made a similar statement.
</P>
<P>
"There has been no decision to give up the air campaign. The
allies are united behind the air campaign. They think it is going
well and they think it will go better in the future," said Bacon.
</P>
<P>
Bacon said the only movement on the ground troop issue has been
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana giving the go-ahead for U.S.
Army Gen. Wesley Clark, commander of NATO forces in Europe, to
update an October assessment of what it would take for the allies
to invade Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Bacon said that the new assessment would take into account new
facts on the ground, including the buildup of Serbs forces in the
past few months inside the Serbian province of Kosovo; the
expulsion of up to 1 million ethnic Albanians from their homes;
and the effects of NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from 19 NATO countries and 25 partnership countries are
gathering in Washington for a summit to mark the 50th anniversary
of NATO. The topic of ground troops is certain to dominate the
agenda.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Jobless Claims Down by 5,000 Last Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The number of Americans filing
applications for unemployment checks declined last week from a
three-month high the week before, the Labor Department reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A seasonally adjusted 314,000 unemployed people claimed
benefits, down from a revised 319,000 the previous week.
</P>
<P>
It was the third consecutive week of claims higher than 300,000
and followed a nine-week stretch of weekly numbers below that
mark, the longest since 1973.
</P>
<P>
A four-week moving average of claims, which smoothes
fluctuations in the volatile monthly figures, rose by 4,750 to an
11-week high of 306,250.
</P>
<P>
But, even with the increase, economists don't foresee more than
a modest weakening in the strong labor market, which in March
reduced the nation's unemployment rate to a 29-year low of 4.2
percent.

<HEADLINE> China Continues to Encourage Foreign Investment in Infrastructure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- China continues to encourage
foreign investment in the country's infrastructure despite the
fact the "bottleneck" of the economy has been eased considerably.
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the State Development Planning Commission
stated that those agreements already signed on foreign investment
in China's infrastructure will remain valid.
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese government has high credibility, they said. The
government-authorized contracts and agreements must be enforced.
</P>
<P>
 In the past few years when there was a serious shortage of
electricity in the country, the government adopted a series of
preferential policies to draw foreign investment into the sector.
</P>
<P>
 In many power projects, the government promised to ensure the
highest return rate and minimum purchase quantity.
</P>
<P>
 Now that situation has changed in the sector, there will be
some adjustments to the related policies, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
 From now on, the government will not approve agreements that
promise to give foreign investors in the sector fixed returns,
they said.
</P>
<P>
 The officials asked foreign investors in the energy sector to
take this into consideration, adopt appropriate measures and
continue cooperation with their Chinese partners.
</P>
<P>
 In the foreseeable future, China's energy and transportation
sectors will continue to grow steadily, which is a big market for
foreign investors, they added.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Communist Leader in Highly Critical Condition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Veteran communist leader of
Nepal Man Mohan Adhikari was in highly critical condition Thursday
as there was no activity in his brain, the official RSS news
agency said.
</P>
<P>
RSS quoted doctors as saying that about 70 percent of
Adhikari's kidneys has stopped functioning.
</P>
<P>
Despite fluctuation in blood pressure, his heart was
functioning well, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Adhikari, chairman of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified
Marxist-Leninist, CPN-UML), has been in a state of coma since
Monday morning when he fainted all of a sudden, the Teaching
Hospital said.
</P>
<P>
Three Indian doctors had made a medical checkup for the
79-year-old leader.
</P>
<P>
Adhikari became the first communist prime minister in Nepal
when his party secured the largest number of seats in the mid-term
polls in November 1994.

<HEADLINE> High Court Intervenes in Israel's Residency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Israel's High Court of
Justice ordered Thursday the Israeli authorities to hand over all
information and data about the revocation of residency status and
identity card confiscations of the Jerusalemite Palestinians to
the court for consideration.
</P>
<P>
The High Court of Justice issued this order after hearing the
petitions filed by several Israeli and Palestinian lawyers and
peace groups against the Israeli government's policy of revoking
the residency status of the Palestinians and confiscating their
identity cards in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The concerned Israeli authorities must hand over all
information and date concerning this matter within three months to
this court and then the court will decide what actions will be
taken, the court said.
</P>
<P>
The petitions, sent to the court in April last year,
challenged those policies of the Israeli government, which have
transformed the Palestinians in Jerusalem, who are rooted in the
city, into illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996, 2,083 Palestinian Jerusalemite families have lost
their rights to live in Jerusalem and the revocation of
Palestinian residency rights is part of Israel's silent campaign
of ethnic cleansing aimed at Judaizing Jerusalem by altering its
demographic balance, the petitions pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority Minister in Charge of Jerusalem
Affairs Faisal Husseini told Xinhua that Jerusalem is the capital
of the Palestinian people and the Palestinian side will do all it
can to protect it.
</P>
<P>
Until 1995, Israel allowed Palestinians to retain their
permanent residency status in Jerusalem as long as they did not
live abroad for more than seven years and returned periodically
to the city.
</P>
<P>
But in 1995, Israel abruptly changed course, and many
Palestinians had their identity cards revoked and were forced to
leave the city.

<HEADLINE> Effort on Cyprus Not Affected by Greek Cypriots' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Ambassador to Cyprus
Kenneth Brill Thursday said that Washington's effort on the Cyprus
issue is not affected by the Cypriot peoples' attitudes towards
the crisis in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
After calling on Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides, Brill
assured that the United States is committed to making a
substantial effort for a settlement in Cyprus this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. diplomat said "it's important for people here
to realize that it does not help to take a one-sided view on other
problems such as the one in Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
A great number of Greek Cypriots have voiced opposition to the
ongoing air strikes against Yugoslavia by the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization on the pretext that ethnic cleansing was being
committed by Belgrade against the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, a
Serbian province in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
They feel Western countries are using double standards, as
Turkey, a NATO member state, still keeps its troops on the
northern third of Cyprus after its 1973 invasion in the wake of a
failed pro-Greece coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
A few days ago Brill's remarks that the Greek Cypriots'
positions on the Yugoslav crisis may affect efforts for a Cyprus
settlement set off strong reaction here.

<HEADLINE> EU To Ban All Beef Imports From United States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission is
discussing a possible ban on all beef imports from the United
States after finding some traces of growth hormones in U.S. beef
shipped to the member countries of the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Sources with the EU executive branch confirmed here Thursday
that a final decision on the total beef ban, which would take
effect in mid-June, would be made next week.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the 15-nation European Union only imports beef
certified as hormone-free. But the EU executive officials said
meat inspection between May and November of last year showed
residue of hormones in U.S. beef imported by western Europe as
supposedly hormone-free beef.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the European Commission has said that the
hormone-treated beef violated a EU prohibition and the commission
had to start blocking all beef imports as early as June 15 if the
United States did not address the issue.
</P>
<P>
The EU prohibition has taken into force for almost 10 years
since 1989 when the EU pointed out that such beef imports posed a
threat against human health. However, the United States has for
years fought the hormone ban, arguing that there was no scientific
evidence fo health risks from such beef.
</P>
<P>
For a long period of time, most American beef producers feed
growth hormones to cattle to make them grow faster and bigger and
such beef products have been widely sold on the American market.

KAMPALA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has recommended the country's Heifer Project
International (HPI) for a one- million-U.S.dollar award set by the
American-based Conrad N. Hilton Humanitarian Prize Foundation.
</P>
<P>
The president made the recommendation when he met with the
foundation director Jude Miller here Thursday morning, a press
release from the President's Office said.
</P>
<P>
Museveni told his guest that Heifer Project International has
made a big impact on the lives of the Ugandans who have received
its heifers. So the organization competes favorably for the
prize, he asserted.
</P>
<P>
The foundation has made available the award of one million
dollars to be given to any organization anywhere in the world
judged to have made the greatest impact toward alleviating human
suffering.
</P>
<P>
A total of 229 organizations worldwide were nominated to
compete for the prize but through a process of elimination, only
20 organizations, including Uganda's Heifer Project, have remained
as candidates.
</P>
<P>
The American foundation seeks to alleviate human suffering,
especially that of disadvantaged children. Its priority sectors
include, among others, care of the blind and prevention of
blindness in the world.
</P>
<P>
Creation and maintenance of clean water supplies in developing
countries, development assistance and care for disabled infants
and toddlers are also areas of its concern.

<HEADLINE> EU Envoy Suggests 2 Steps in DRC Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Visiting envoy of the European
Union to the Great Lakes region, Aldo Ajello, said in Angola's
capital Thursday that two steps should be taken to resolve the
crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) through
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference before ending his 48-hour trip
to Luanda, Ajello said that the DRC government should hold talks
with the rebels before the neighboring countries involved in the
conflict can sit down at the negotiation table.
</P>
<P>
The EU envoy noted that the conflict in the former Zaire has
entangled with the wars in neighboring countries such as Angola,
Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the positions of all the countries involved
in the DRC crisis are crucial to the settlement of the conflict in
the vast central African country.
</P>
<P>
Ajello spoke highly of the the peace agreement signed recently
in Sirte, Libya. He said that the agreement brought "an important
opportunity" for the peaceful resolution to the DRC conflict
because it contains some feasible proposals including the
withdrawal of all foreign troops from the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The EU envoy noted that as an important player in the DRC
conflict, Angola can make its contribution to the peace process in
the third largest African country.
</P>
<P>
He said that the international mediators and the warring
parties in the DRC "should act immediately" and "as required by
the agreement."
</P>
<P>
Ajello arrived here Tuesday and he held talks with Angolan
Defense Minister Kundi Pahyama, Deputy Foreign Minister Toco Serao
and General Secretary of the People's Movement for the Liberation
of Angola, Angola's ruling party, Joao Lourenco.
</P>
<P>
The African trip will also bring Ajello to Namibia, Zambia,
Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda and Ethiopia.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Dollarization Offers Benefits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States could expect
to benefit in a number of ways if several Latin America countries
decide to adopt the U.S. dollar as their own currency, Deputy
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Summers and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan appeared
before a Senate Banking subcommittee to discuss the economic
impact of another nation dropping its own currency in favor of
using the U.S. dollar, a development known as "dollarization."
</P>
<P>
"If dollarization helped to achieve greater economic stability
and growth in countries in our hemisphere which have suffered so
much instability in the past, it would clearly be in the economic
and broader national interest of the United States," Summers said.
</P>
<P>
He said dollarizing countries would be extending an
interest-free loan to the United States by acquiring dollars for
use in their domestic economies.
</P>
<P>
Dollarization also would reduce the cost of doing business with
those countries and reduce uncertainty about future exchange rate
changes, he said. "There might be greater capacity for capital and
trade flows in both directions as a result," he added.
</P>
<P>
Argentina has been at the forefront of a debate over the
virtues of dumping its national currency, the peso, in favor of
declaring the dollar its sole legal tender ever since the
country's central bank floated such ideas earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Similar proposals have been made in Mexico and El Salvador.
Panama is the only Latin American economy that is fully dollarized
and that has no central bank of its own.
</P>
<P>
Some economists say that by subjecting a country to the
discipline of the U.S. monetary regime, such a move could help
nations boost their credibility among international investors.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan and Summers noted, however, that no currency system
could bring economic stability unless it was backed up by sound
and solid economic fundamentals, such as a strong banking system
and responsible fiscal policies.
</P>
<P>
"It is very important to us to be certain, as we view it, that
dollarization is not some means to bypass the types of policies
that are required to create stability," Greenspan said. "If that
is done, the country that endeadors to do it will find within a
reasonably short time that it will fail."
</P>
<P>
The risk of failure even in a dollarized economy led both
Summers and Greenspan to warn against blaming the United States
for any financial crises that might still occur.
</P>
<P>
Summers also cautioned that dollarization would pose risks to
the United States, particularly if a Latin American country was
experiencing hard times. Since the country would not be able to
use its own monetary policy to stimulate growth by lowering
interest rates, there could be resentment toward the United States
because the nation would have lost control of its economic destiny
and pressure on the Federal Reserve to take Latin American
troubles into account when setting U.S. interest rates.

<HEADLINE> Left-wing European Parties Say Solution on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of 17 left-wing
European parties Thursday rejected a solution to Yugoslav crisis
guaranteed by troops of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),
calling for U.N. involvement.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution issued at the end of their two-day meeting here
Thursday, the leaders denounced NATO's role as a "world
policeman," saying this will lead to further "substitution of the
U.N." and arbitrary use of force.
</P>
<P>
The leaders appealed for the resumption of political dialog
under the auspices of the U.N. and with the participation of Russia
to seek a solution to the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
The solution should safeguard the Kosovo refugees' rights to
return to their homes in safety as well as their human and
political rights, said the resolution.
</P>
<P>
It should also safeguard autonomy for Kosovo and secure
Yugoslavia's sovereignty and territorial integrity, it added.
</P>
<P>
NATO began air strikes against Yugoslav Serb targets on March
24 after Belgrade refused to accept an agreement which requires
Serb-led government to grant autonomy to the independence-seeking
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and allow NATO troops to police Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Albanian refugees have since fled the
province and poured into neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
The leaders strongly condemned NATO air strikes as violating
"flagrantly international law and the U.N. Charter," calling for
an end to the raids and the hostilities in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
They also expressed solidarity with "the heavily afflicted
people of Yugoslavia."

JOHANNESBURG, April 22 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's ruling
African National Congress (ANC) Thursday effectively axed three of
its existing seven provincial premiers.
</P>
<P>
The party released its premiership list for the June 2
elections, ending months of speculation.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's top trade unionist, Mbhazima Shilowa, will step
in to replace Mathole Motshekga as premier of Gauteng, the richest
province. Shilowa is the leader of the Congress of South African
Trade Unions.

Free State Premier Ivy Matsepe-Cassaburi will be replaced by
Winkie Direko, a 69-year-old member of the National Council of
Provinces.

Ibrahim Rasool and Sibusiso Ndebele were respectively nominated
as premiers of Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal should the party win
the two provinces. The Western Cape is now ruled by the New

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Liberalize Telecommunications Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's telecommunications
industry will begin its liberalization process Friday when the
sector's new regulator gets authority to license market players, a
senior official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The process would culminate in the June splitting of Kenya
Posts &AMP; Telecommunications Corporation into two companies, namely
Telkom Kenya and Postal Corporation of Kenya (Posta), said Samuel
Chepkong'a, Director- General of the regulatory Communications
Commission of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
All telecom companies to be licensed in Kenya must be at least
60 percent locally owned, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The process of liberalization in the telecom industry won't be
delayed since everything is ready, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is learnt that Kenyan Transport &AMP; Communications Minister
William ole Ntimama will Friday publish the full board of the
Communications Commission of Kenya in its official Kenya Gazette
and outline its legal mandate.
</P>
<P>
"The Gazette notice effectively paves the way for the licensing
of the Telkom Kenya, the Kenya Postal Corporation (Posta) and the
Safaricom as separate firms by June 30, 1999," said Chekong'a.
</P>
<P>
The Telkom Kenya will operate the telecommunications business
of Kenya Posts &AMP; Telecommunications Corporation, while the Posta
will run the loss- making postal service.
</P>
<P>
The Safaricom, designed to provide cellular phone services as
an independent company in June, will be reincorporated as a joint
venture between the Telkom Kenya and the British
telecommunications giant Vodafone.
</P>
<P>
The British firm is to take a 40-percent stake while the Telkom
Kenya will retain a 60-percent share holding, Chepkong'a said.
</P>
<P>
He said the commission will give the Safaricom joint venture a
six-month period to be prepared for competition.
</P>
<P>
Chepkong'a said Telkom Kenya would remain the dominant player
in national and international long distance service for another
five years, adding that it would be penalized if it fails to
improve services.
</P>
<P>
Chepkong'a said he expected the price of a mobile phone line
and equipment to fall to around 10,000 shillings (about 150 U.S.
dollars) within a year from the current 78,000 shillings (about
1,200 dollars) after the Vodafone-Safaricom partnership starts in
June.

<P>
BELGRADE, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic met here Thursday with Russian presidential envoy on
Yugoslavia Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, the two sides condemned NATO's bombing
campaign on Yugoslavia and called for an immediate end to the air
raids, the Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin's visit was a fresh mediation effort by Russia
since Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov visited Belgrade on
March 30.
</P>
<P>
Both sides vowed to work for a peaceful settlement of the
Kosovo problem.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said Moscow would make further efforts to
stimulate the political process in the belief that this could
produce political accord on wide autonomy for Kosovo, with full
respect for the equality of the people and of the ethnic
communities in Kosovo and for the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Yugoslavia and its republic of Serbia, Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by Serbian President Milan
Milutinovic, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic, Serbian
Premier Mirko Marjanovic, Russian Ambassador to Yugoslavia Yury
Kotov and other Yugoslav and Russian officials.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin, who arrived here earlier Thursday, has left for

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said on Thursday that it will be a "step forward" if the report
that Yugoslavia agreed to allow a U.N.-led force to be deployed in
Kosovo is true.
</P>
<P>
"If there is an offer for a genuine security force, that's the
first time that Mr. Milosevic has ever done that, and that
represents, I suppose, some step forward," Clinton told a joint
press conference with NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Belgrade say that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic has accepted the idea of a U.N.-controlled
"international presence" in Kosovo if the NATO bombing stops and
the alliance withdraws troops from Yugoslavia's borders.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that he did not know the development and had not
studied it.
</P>
<P>
"I can't comment on this except to say, if it is true, then it
is at least the first acknowledgment by Mr. Milosevic, that there
will have to be a security force there," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"My interest here is in something that will work, that will
have the support of the parties. My belief is that the members of
our alliance want us all to be able to go in there and that the
Kosovar Albanians want to feel protected and will expect us to be
there," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Clinton said that the United States does not favor
the deployment of ground troops into a hostile environment in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
However, he said he would support NATO's plan to update the
assessment on whether ground troops should be used against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"I support the secretary-general's decision to update the
assessment. I think it is a wise and prudent course," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
NATO leaders decided to update the military assessment made in
October when tentative plans were made for a ground invasion into
Yugoslavia, but they were put on the shelf after NATO decided a
ground war not warranted.

bounced back in March, strengthening hopes that the UK
economy will steer clear of a severe recession.

High Street sales rose 0.4 percent from the previous

<HEADLINE> Deutsche Telekom, Telecom Italia Form World Giant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN April 22 (Xinhua)--One of the world's largest
telecommunications group was formed after the German giant
Deutsche Telekom AG and Telecom Italia SpA announced their merger
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint conference in London by top executives of
the two companies, Ron Sommer of Deutsche Telekom said the fusion
would create a company which would expanse "without border".
</P>
<P>
Under the plan of the two companies, the German side will hold
a stake of 56 per cent in the new group valued at 180 billion U.S.
dollars, and Ron Sommer and his Italian counterpart Franco Bernade
will serve as co-chief executives.
</P>
<P>
With more than 270,000 employees, the new concern will have 109
million customers world wide, provide nearly one third population
in Europe with telecommunications service, and make up an annual
turnover of about 64 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The merger, which helps Deutsche Telekom to escape the bruising
competition on the domestic market, sets a landmark in European
business, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
And, it is likely to be only the first stage in an expansion
drive that is expected to lead them into acquisitions in Britain
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The likelihood of further large purchases by the new merged
group has also raised the prospects of a big realignment in the
world telecom market with Britain's Cable and Wireless PLC and the
U.S. phone group Sprint Corp seen by analysts as possible takeover
targets for the new European telecoms company.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Mannesmann AG, which along with more than 50
other telecom operators have been breathing down Deutsche
Telekom's neck in Germany's domestic market, might also begin to
look for goals across Europe.
</P>
<P>
Mannesmann warned this week that the Deutsche Telekom-Telecom
Italia concern might not be in its best interests.
</P>
<P>
Just before Easter, Mannesmann took over the German rival Otelo
Communications in a move seen as paving the way for consolidation
in Germany's fast-paced telecommunications market.
</P>
<P>
German phone charges have plummeted as a price war has taken
hold in the country.
</P>
<P>
As a measure of the extent to which rivalry has chipped away at
Deutsche Telekom's previous domination of the German market, the
partially-privatized phone giant announced this month that sales
during in first quarter of 1999 fell 6.9 per cent to 16.1 billion
marks (9 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
This was due to a loss of market share in long-distance and
international calls, which have been the focus of Germany's big
phone price cuts.
</P>
<P>
One of the losers of the mega-fusion is likely to be the German
group's long-standing partner, France Telecom SA, which reacted
with indignation as the likelihood of the German-Italian merger
loomed large last week.
</P>
<P>
In a sense, Deutsche Telekom's decision to merge with Telecom
Italia confirmed, as analysts have long suspected, that Deutsche
Telekom's links with the French side reflected pressure from the
political establishment in Bonn and Paris to help underpin the
French-German axis.
</P>
<P>
But whatever the concerns expressed by Rome about Deutsche
Telekom ending up in the driving seat of the new giant, few
analysts believe that the French would have agreed to a merger
where the German group would have gained the upper hand.
</P>
<P>
There are still hurdles ahead for the merger, not the least
being the Europe's monopoly authorities and the shareholders of
Telecom Italia, who are already unimpressed by the defense
strategy launched to head off the Olivetti bid.
</P>
<P>
What could also pose problems is that the two companies still
have to agree on a name for the merged group.

<HEADLINE> Romania Sets Up Inter-Ministerial Committee to Stop Drug Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, 23 April (Xinhua) -- The Romanian government is
setting up an inter- ministerial committee to stop the growing
traffic in drugs, since drug smuggling and addiction are becoming
more and more prevalent throughout the country, the official
Rompres news agency reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The new committee will facilitate communication and
collaboration between the Ministry of the Interior and local and
central public administration authorities, as well as
substantiating orders and decisions regarding the steps and
actions to be taken in the fight against drug smuggling and
addiction.
</P>
<P>
The committee will work under the leadership of the prime
minister, according to a government decision.
</P>
<P>
Drug smuggling and addiction in Romania became serious after
the fall of the Ceausescu regime. The police confiscated 20 tons
of drugs and made over 530 criminal drug arrests in the 1991-1998
period.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a recent poll taken in the capital city indicated
that pupils in several high schools in Bucharest took drugs, even
more than once.

BANGKOK, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government allocated a
little more than 1.480 billion baht (40 million U.S. dollars) to
cope with the AIDS situation in the next fiscal year beginning
October 1 this year, the Public Relations Department said on

The Public Health Ministry receives about 1,100 million baht
and the University Affairs Ministry gets about 175 million baht to
help educate the people. The rest is shared by 8 ministries and
agencies such as the National Police Office, the Prime Minister's
office and the Interior Ministry, for their anti-AIDS programs.
</P>
<P>
Since Thailand's economy started to tumble a few years ago, the
AIDS situation has worsened as more people go into the sex trade
to earn extra money, the press release said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said that the smooth transfer of over 81,000 military personnel to
civilian work this year is conducive to the state's reform,
development and stability.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (
CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military
Commission, made the remark when meeting delegates to a national
meeting on transfer of military staff to civilian work here today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed the importance of political stability and
reducing military staff by 500,000 during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The large number of military personnel waiting to be re-
assigned this year is surely a difficulty for local governments
when state-owned enterprises and governments are under reform," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"However, successful transfer of these personnel is helpful to
the stability and improvement of military quality," Jiang stressed.
</P>
<P>
He asked Communist Party committees and governments at all
levels to help solve problems in making civilian arrangements for
these military officers and to find jobs for them in the civilian
sector.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jiang also asked the military staff to be
subordinate to the overall interests of the state and accept the
arrangements made for them, making new contributions to the
country's reform, opening-up and modernization cause.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu Rongji and Vice-President Hu Jintao also met the
delegates today.

<HEADLINE> APEC Agrees to Speed Up Work to Solve Y2K Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 23 (Xinhua) -- APEC member economies Friday
wound up a two-day symposium here, committing themselves to
accelerating the work to tackle the potential cross-border impacts
of the Y2K problem on critical economic infrastructure and to
advance contingency planning within the region.
</P>
<P>
In a closing speech, Ambassador Tim Hannah, executive director
of APEC Secretariat said a key outcome of the symposium was their
agreement to take action to speed up the work to solve the Y2K
problem and enhance cooperation by APEC economies in addressing
the issue in such critical areas as financial services,
transportation, telecommunications, energy and customs.
</P>
<P>
In the two-day discussions, attended by about 350 participants
from all 21 APEC member economies, they reviewed Y2K issues,
problems and potential disruptions, exchanged information, reached
conclusions and recommendations in each sector, and proposed
concrete measures to promote cooperation and mobilize action among
member economies.
</P>
<P>
They made special proposals to accelerate work in the areas of
testing and contingency planning.
</P>
<P>
Noting a lack of understanding from small and medium-sized
enterprises (SME) over tackling the Y2K, the participants said
more is needed to be done to encourage SMEs to take the Y2K
problem seriously.
</P>
<P>
The participants also stressed the need to establish networks
of experts from APEC member economies in key sectors to ensure
closer cooperation within APEC on Y2K issues in the period leading
to the year 2000, and attached importance to the extensive work
undertaken or to be done by international organizations.
</P>
<P>
The recommendations and conclusions of the symposium will be
presented to APEC senior officials and through them to APEC
ministers and leaders for consideration.
</P>
<P>
The symposium was a centerpiece of APEC Y2K Week, an initiative
proposed by Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and agreed upon
by other APEC leaders at the APEC leaders' Meeting in Kuala Lumpur
last November.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) made a
final decision Friday on an oil ban against the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia (FRY), saying it was a "common position" prohibiting
the supply and sale of oil and oil products to the war-worn Balkan
country.
</P>
<P>
The Council of the European Union, the EU's decision-making
body at ministerial level, said this decision is a further support
of the reiteration by the EU heads of state and government on
April 14 of "their determination not to tolerate the killings and
deportations in Kosovo and that the use of the most severe
measures is necessary and warranted."
</P>
<P>
Currently, 11 countries of the 15-nation EU are also members of
the 19-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
The EU said in a statement that the ban will not apply to sales
or supplies for verified humanitarian purposes, in particular for
the needs of internally displaced persons and returnees. "The
common position will be kept under constant review," the decision
said.
</P>
<P>
The EU said an implementing regulation will be adopted next
week at a general affairs meeting of EU foreign ministers in
Luxembourg.

<HEADLINE> HK Releases First Balance of Payments Account </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong recorded an overall
Balance of Payments (BoP) surplus of 95.1 billion HK dollars (12.
19 billion U.S. dollars) in 1997, showed a set of complete BoP
account released Friday by the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) government.
</P>
<P>
The figure was reflected in the amount added in that year to
the reserve assets, according to the account, the first complete
one compiled and published for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
A BoP account is an integrated statistical statement of an
economy's external transactions with the rest of the world,
explained Frederick Ho, commissioner for census and statistics of
the SAR at a press conference to release the BoP account.
</P>
<P>
The BoP account for 1997 released Friday contains detailed
estimates of the current account components, an aggregate capital
and financial account figure, and statistics on the change in
reserve assets, Ho said.
</P>
<P>
Since concurrently a current account deficit of 52.4 billion HK
dollars (6.72 billion U.S. dollars) was recorded, it implied that
there had been a net financial capital inflow of non-reserve
assets of 147.5 billion HK dollars (18.91 billion U.S. dollars) to
Hong Kong from the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
That is the sum of the two amounts above of 95.1 billion HK
dollars (12.19 billion U.S. dollars) and 52.4 billion HK dollars (
6.72 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The current account deficit of 52.4 billion HK dollars was the
net effect of a visible trade deficit of 133.9 billion HK dollars
(17.17 billion U.S. dollars), an invisible trade surplus of 86.4
billion HK dollars (11.08 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The current account deficit was 3.9 percent as ratio of the
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) estimate at current market prices in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Reserve assets in the BoP account reflect net change in Hong
Kong's foreign exchange assets, which come under the management of
the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.
</P>
<P>
The increase in reserve assets in 1997 (95.1 billion HK dollars,
which is equivalent to 12.19 U.S. dollars) indicated that there
was a corresponding amount of overall BoP surplus for that year.
</P>
<P>
The aggregate figure for the capital and financial account (for
non-reserve assets) for 1997 is derived from the BoP accounting
identity, which reflects a net financial capital inflow of 147.5
billion HK dollars into Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
To provide comprehensive data on external financial capital
flows, a new survey entitled "Survey of External Claims,
Liabilities and Income" (SECLI) will be launched in May to collect
detailed data for the financial account, Ho said.
</P>
<P>
When the survey becomes a regular data collection mechanism,
both annual and quarterly estimates of the BoP account with
detailed breakdowns for the financial account will be available.
</P>
<P>
The broad BoP account for 1998 will be available in late 1999.
Similar to the 1997 account, the broad account contains detailed
current account estimates and an aggregate figure for the capital
and financial account, together with the net change in reserve
assets, Ho said.

<HEADLINE> Britain Urges Russian Envoy to Persuade Yugoslavia More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Friday that
Russian Balkans envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin should work further on
persuading Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to accept NATO's
terms for ending the war in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Blair said that he did not
believe Chernomyrdin should travel to Washington to meet NATO
leaders this weekend on a new Yugoslav peace initiative, a Reuters
report from Washington said.
</P>
<P>
Britain welcomed the Russian role in seeking a diplomatic
settlement to the Kosovo crisis but felt Chernomyrdin would do
better to work further on persuading Milosevic to accept NATO's
terms, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
NATO's demand was very clear, which meant a total withdrawal of
Serb forces from Kosovo and the return of all ethnic Albanian
refugees under protection of a NATO-led security force, he said.
</P>
<P>
Blair's spokesman also said NATO was "extremely skeptical"
about Milosevic's reported agreement to a Russian proposal for a U.
N.-led international presence in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We will study the detail of the Russian proposal when there is
detail. In Britain's initial judgment, the Russian plan falls
short by committing Milosevic to only a partial withdrawal of his
troops. It would be better if he continued working on them," the
Reuters report quoted the spokesman as saying.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Reports Situation in Guinea-Bissau as Precarious </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Despite significant gains
in the disarmament process in Guinea-Bissau, the situation on the
ground remained precarious, a report by the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS) said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
In its report submitted to the United Nations Security Council,
the ECOWAS said that as the date of the elections drew nearer, the
risks of tension developing between the loyalists and the junta
and political parties would increase.
</P>
<P>
Under the Abuja Agreement of November 1, 1998, general and
presidential elections were to be held not later than the end of
March 1999. However, the delays in implementing the agreement made
it impossible to hold the elections by the dates originally
stipulated and the parties later decided to hold those elections
in June or July.
</P>
<P>
The report said the ECOWAS Military Observer Group (ECOMOG),
which was deployed in the country in December 1998, had done
excellent work as part of the implementation of the Abuja
Agreement. It pointed out that, however, the ECOMOG still had many
tasks to accomplish in the country.
</P>
<P>
The report called for what it described as appropriate friendly
pressure to be brought to bear on the parties to encourage them to
resolve the crisis peacefully, avoid any institutional vacuum and
refrain from recruiting and training new combatants and hiding
weapons.
</P>
<P>
The report also noted that the presence and effective action in
Guinea-Bissau of United Nations humanitarian agencies would be of
great help to the country.
</P>
<P>
"Adequate assistance, promptly provided, would do much to
alleviate the suffering of displaced persons and refugees," the
ECOWAS report added.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Police Investigate Threat Against PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli police are
investigating a death threat against Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and his family, Israel Radio reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman confirmed a Maariv newspaper report Friday
that a letter sent to Netanyahu's office warned him to withdraw
his candidacy for prime ministership in the May elections and
threatened to kill him and his family if he wins.
</P>
<P>
An automatic rifle bullet was included in the envelop
containing the threat letter, Maariv said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is running neck-and-neck with opposition Labor Party
leader Ehud Barak in the runup to the May 17 elections, according
to a Gallup poll also published in Maariv Friday.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that the right-wing prime minister would
win 36 percent of the votes and Barak 34 percent in the first round
election.
</P>
<P>
But it asserted that Barak would defeat Netanyahu by 46 percent
to 40 percent in a runoff on June 1 if none of the five candidates
can break the 50 percent threshold in the first round.
</P>
<P>
Center Party leader and Former Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai is sliding in the poll, which shows he would get only
11 percent of the vote in the first round.
</P>
<P>
As Mordechai continues to fall in the polls, Barak has urged
him to drop out of the race and join forces with Labor Party so as
to defeat Netanyahu in the first round. But Mordechai has rejected
the proposal.

<HEADLINE> Jiang on State Enterprise Reforms (part one) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, April 23 (Xinhua) - The priority for China's economic
work this year is to handle well the reform and developments of
state enterprises, President Jiang Zemin has said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC)
Central Committee, made the reamrks during his week-long
inspection to Sichuan province, which ended today here.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed that this is on the top of the country's agenda.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that these enterprises will succeed so
long as they follow the guidelines set by the Party, be market-
oriented and deepen reforms.
</P>
<P>
In the past week, Jiang visited a number of big enterprises in
the province, including the Wuliangye Liquor Group, Panzhihua Iron
and Steel Company, Ertan Hydropower Station, Chengdu Aircraft
Industrial Company, and Changhong Group, whose net assets exceeded
11 billion yuan (1.3 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Briefed on the development of these enterprises, the Chinese
leader expressed his approval of their accumulated successes over
the past couple of years.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the success of some state enterprises, some are still
struggling and in difficulties," said Jiang, who is also chairman
of the Central Military Commission.
</P>
<P>
"We should bring into full play all favorable factors, enhance
people's confidence and make unremitting efforts to achieve a
breakthrough in the reform and development of state enterprises,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
During the inspection, Jiang also went to Liangshan Yi
autonomous prefecture and re-visited two farming families there,
whose lives have improved much in the eight years since he last
met them.
</P>
<P>
Speeding up the economic growth and social development in
ethnic regions will have great bearings on the overall development
and prosperity of the whole nation, and on the great cause of
China's modernization drive, Jiang declared.

<P>
"There are many tough tasks ahead and it is of extreme
significance to maintain social and political stability and unity,
" he stressed.
</P>
<P>
On the building of the CPC, the Chinese leader said that
another priority is to launch a campaign among party cadres
highlighting the education in theoretical study, political
awareness and good conduct.
</P>
<P>
"Doing the job well is of major and far-reaching significance
to building up the Party, and to the enhancement of the Party's
fighting capacity and cohesion," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the CPC is responsible for the historical
mission of leading the nation into the next millennium and
carrying forward the socialist cause with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
It is imperative that the Party be fully prepared for all the
challenges ahead, the Chinese leader noted.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in the province, Jiang also inspected the armed
forces and police there, asking them to contribute more to
stability and prosperity in the southwest region.

<HEADLINE> No Action Should be Taken Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi said on Friday that no action should be taken against
Yugoslavia without the consent and approval of the U.N. Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi made the remarks upon his return from Bonn from a
shuttle visit to Russia, Italy, Albania and Germany along with
officials of the 54-member Organization of Islamic Conference
(OIC) contact group states, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The OIC contact group states include Iran, Malaysia, Pakistan,
Turkey, Morocco, Senegal, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
He said any action against Yugoslavia without U.N. consent
would become the cause of displacement, ethnic cleansing and
massacre of a great number of Kosovars in that country.
</P>
<P>
"One should not expect the settlement of the Kosovo crisis
without international consensus," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the just-concluded visit by the OIC contact group,
Kharrazi said the majority of the officials in the four countries
concurred with the OIC contact group over the concern of Muslim
countries on the trend of development taking shape in the area.
</P>
<P>
"The four countries opined that that such kind of contacts
needed to be continued," he said.
</P>
<P>
The visit provided excellent grounds for the OIC to exert its
influence on the trend of developments, especially in the
political field, and to set up footing for the OIC to function
effectively as an important international organization at
different forums, he added.

<HEADLINE> Journalists Angered by NATO Attack Against Yugoslav TV Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The International Federation of
Journalists (IFJ) Friday accused NATO of deliberately attacking
media targets because the alliance is holding its 50th birthday
party during a "small nasty war" in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Expressing deep concern over NATO's attack against Serbia's
state television center in Belgrade early this morning, the IFJ
said the alliance had violated its pledge to hit military targets
only.
</P>
<P>
The IFJ's General Secretary Aidan White told a news conference
that "this bomb attack seems to make a very clear statement that
civilian and media targets are legitimate."
</P>
<P>
The attack means that Serbian journalists working for a free
media are now more than ever in danger of being killed, White said.
</P>
<P>
"We need more solidarity with these journalists, not actions
which mean they will now be put more on the firing line," he told
a group of journalists here in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
"The rules of the game seem to have changed over the last few
days and that's very dangerous," White said.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, NATO missiles destroyed one of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic's two official residences in Belgrade. On
Wednesday, NATO's air strikes destroyed Yugoslavia's ruling party
headquarters and three TV stations in the same Belgrade building.
</P>
<P>
The Brussels-based IFJ is a federation of journalism unions
representing about 450,000 journalists all over the world.

He told reporters in Pretoria that the exact price hike would

<P>
"This is going to be something of a shock to motorists, and
that is why I am going out of my way to warn motorists to be

</P>

He stressed this was an increase in the base petrol price only,

</P>
<P>
Maduna said the base petrol price was adjusted automatically

</P>
<P>
This formula takes into account changes in the rand/dollar

<P>
LAGOS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Having seen Japan rising as a shiny
star at the on-going FIFA World Youth Championship which has seen
so many upsets, fans, especially those favor the Asian team, are
wondering whether Japan can make history by winning Japan's and
even Asia's first-ever golden cup in a world soccer tournament.
</P>
<P>
Japan, the only Asian team marching into the semi-final of
Nigeria 99, has already stolen enough limelights from the
surprising defeats of defending champion Argentina, and three-time
WYC champion Brazil, two-time WYC champion Portugal and world
heavy-weight teams of Germany and England.
</P>
<P>
Its 2-1 victory over South African team of Uruguay raised the
expectations of Asian fans for a golden cup at the tournament, in
the final against Spanish in Lagos Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Asian team's dazzling victories over the U.S., England,
Portugal, Mexico and Uruguay came also as a big promotion for
coach Philippe Troussier. Nicknamed as the "white witch doctor",
Troussier seems to have already managed a comeback to Africa after
he led the Japanese boys to win one victory after another.
</P>
<P>
Troussiers, who lost his job as Nigerian coach after the
disappointing performances by "Super Eagles" at the France '98
World Cup, was deeply moved as Nigerian fans chanted "We want
Troussier, we want Troussier. "
</P>
<P>
The Japanese boys, who were even termed as "outsiders" after
their 5:4 win over two-time championship Portugal, silenced
critics with a 2:1 victory over Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
With high discipline, much improved technics, and heightened
morale, the Japanese are expected to lift up the golden cup
Saturday.

BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Millions of people across China
today celebrated the 50th anniversary of the founding of the navy
of the Chinese People's Liberation Army which was formed in a
river off a tiny village in Taizhou city in Jiangsu province.
</P>
<P>
Since those early days the fleet has grown into one of China's
strongest military forces.
</P>
<P>
To mark the occasion the Chinese Post Office has issued a
series of commemorative first day covers and postcards which were
also on sale at the navy headquarters in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The navy's birthplace at Taizhou has also been given a facelift
to mark the occasion and a new naval maritime museum has been
opened, largely financed by the local government.
</P>
<P>
In China's acknowledged naval capital of Qingdao, in Shandong
province, navy ratings and officers took part in a grand ceremony
today flying thousands of national flags.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile in Beijing, China's world-famous naval military band
played martial music as well as foreign jazz tunes to the delight
of crowds watching in the spring sunshine.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere throughout the country in places like the northern
coastal city of Dalian or the southern city of Haikou on Hainan
island, navy men and women immersed themselves in joy and
happiness, singing and dancing, and hoisting both Chinese and
international pennants high.
</P>
<P>
"But this is not just a time for celebrating," declared a navy
officer. "We are also using the occasion to reflect on the past
and to think about the future."

BANGKOK, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
Friday urged Thai people to join hands to form a strong national
force to solve the "social crisis" which has resulted from the
country's worst economic turmoil in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening session of a meeting on national social
work held here, Chuan said social problems, namely high
unemployment rates, crime cases and health problems caused by the
economic crisis that started in mid-1997 could not be addressed
unless all parties in the society joined force to counter them,
Thai news agency reported.

<P>
Cooperation and consolidation from all forces in the society
were needed to cope with the problems triggered by several
interdependent factors, he said.

He also praised government agencies and all parties concerned
for their cooperation in implementing measures to alleviate the
problems.

<HEADLINE> China's National Poison Control Center Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Poison control experts and health
officials in China are seeking ways to cut down the increasing
number of poisoning cases in China from a wide range of sources,
including agricultural and industrial.
</P>
<P>
Today they took remarkable steps to achieve that goal as a
national poison control center became operational.
</P>
<P>
The Poison Control Center under the Chinese Academy of
Preventive Medicine is expected to provide a nationwide
comprehensive service including counseling, the testing of
toxicants, clinical diagnosis, first-aid service and training
programs, according to its director Wu Yiqun.
</P>
<P>
Staff at the center will publish information about toxic
materials and the treatment of poisoning to both medical
institutes and the general public through telephones, fax and
Internet.
</P>
<P>
Wu acknowledged that the Chinese are exposed to more and more
dangerous toxicants, such as chemicals, drugs, those from animals
and plants, daily-used products and microbes which have become
more prevalent as the country enjoyed social and economic
development in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The death tolls caused by poisoning and related injuries were
only slightly less than cancer, respiratory diseases, cerebral
illnesses and heart attacks, latest statistics from the Ministry
of Health suggest.
</P>
<P>
However, poisoning cases were traditionally handled by
hospitals or emergency medical teams and usually only after they
had happened and become critical. "Generally they have lacked the
expertise and antidotes, and thus treatments have been delayed,"
Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Sun Chengye, one of the center's experts, said that more than
150,000 cases of pesticide poisoning and industrial poisoning
cases were reported annually nationwide.
</P>
<P>
"More seriously, about 80 percent of poisoning cases have not
been reported due to ignorance or other reasons." he added.
</P>
<P>
Through telephone hotlines and the center's website, medical
institutes and the public can get information about more than 3,
000 kinds of toxic materials, including chemical products,
pesticides and toxic animals and plants.

<HEADLINE> UK Schools Criticized for Over-Reacting to Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Standing Conference on
Drug Abuse (SCODA) said on Friday that too many pupils were being
removed from school after occasional misuse of drugs, or excluded
on a temporary or permanent basis from classes, despite government
advice that dismissal or exclusion should only be used as a last
resort.
</P>
<P>
It warned that children who were excluded from classes were
more likely to get involved in serious abuse and crime. Schools
are expelling and suspending up to 20,000 children a year for drug
abuse, SCODA said.
</P>
<P>
The organization's survey and guidelines were discussed Friday
at the Secondary Heads Association (SHA) conference in the
southern port city of Brighton.
</P>
<P>
Children should only be expelled, it says, if they represent a
serious risk to the health or safety of other pupils, or have not
responded to previous warnings.
</P>
<P>
Research carried out for SCODA by Manchester Metropolitan
University looked at drug-related incidents at 1,000 English
secondary schools.
</P>
<P>
Over a two-year period, there were 1,400 temporary exclusions
for drug-related incidents -- including smoking and alcohol abuse -
- and 400 permanent exclusions.
</P>
<P>
The survey found wide variations in school policies. Some
reserved exclusion for drug trafficking in school, while others
applied the sanction after first-time offenses involving small
amounts of cannabis.
</P>
<P>
SCODA's Chief Executive, Roger Howard, said an estimate based
on the figures suggested that there could be as many as 20,000
exclusions a year across the country -- up to 4,000 of them
permanent.
</P>
<P>
"These figures are disappointing and worrying," he said, "We
believe children should only be excluded as a matter of last
resort. The evidence suggests that pupils who are not in school
are much more likely to come into contact with illegal drugs," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Stance on Taiwan, Tibet Unchanged: Government Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government has no
intention of changing its stance over Taiwan and Tibet despite new
Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara's criticism of China's policies
regarding the two locations, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Shintaro Ishihara's anti-China statements in a news conference
Friday are "his own ideas as a politician," the top government
spokesman said, indicating that they do not reflect the Japanese
government's views.
</P>
<P>
Japan maintains its stance that problems over both Taiwan and
Tibet are China's internal affairs, Nonaka told a regular news
conference.
</P>
<P>
Ishihara repeated his anti-China statements in a press
conference after taking office earlier in the day, claiming that
he thinks "Beijing's policies that ignore the rights of Tibetans
are intolerable."
</P>
<P>
The rightist Japanese politician also attacked China for not
ruling out the possibility of using force if Taiwan makes an
attempt to declare independence, contending that such a stance is
"a source of concern for both Japan and the rest of Asia."
</P>
<P>
Ishihara, who was criticized by China in the early 1990s for
denying crimes committed by Japanese aggressor troops in the
Nanjing Massacre in 1937, drew criticism on his anti-China
statements after he was elected new Tokyo governor last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ishihara, in an interview with Japanese media on April 12,
flagrantly attacked the Chinese government and its policies on
Tibet and Taiwan by distorting facts.

<HEADLINE> Chance Not to Be Missed for China's WTO Entry: AmCham China Chairman (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- As Chinese and U.S. negotiators
negotiate intensely here to resolve the remaining issues
preventing China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO),
American Chamber (AmCham) China chairman Richard Latham urged the
two sides to be reasonable, open-minded and to cooperate so as not
to miss the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
Latham said in a written interview with Xinhua today that it
is high time for the two sides to reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
"President Clinton said that we are 95 percent of the way to
concluding the agreement during Premier Zhu Rongji's recent visit
to the United States, while Premier Zhu said it is closer to 99
percent. We are talking about only a difference of four percent.
We are so close," Latham quoted them as saying.
</P>
<P>
Latham, who also serves as President of United Technologies' (
UTC) International Operation China, stressed, " Too much good work
has been done by both sides to miss seizing this opportunity and
the next goal is to wrap things up by June."
</P>
<P>
"We are very impressed by China's negotiated positions on WTO
entry. This looks like a good agreement," he said.

will be intensified once China enters the WTO.
</P>
<P>

He said, the UTC will find ways to reduce production costs.
Meanwhile, it is its intention to service its elevators, air
conditioners, escalators, air craft engines and other products
from the point of manufacturing, importing and all the way to
installation and servicing.
</P>
<P>
"The UTC will also increase foreign direct investment, and one
of the objectives will be to export the products," he added.
</P>
<P>
It is important to note that the UTC strongly supports China's
ambitions to join the WTO, because it believes that lower trade
barriers will promote further foreign direct investment and better
service for Chinese customers, said Latham.

<P>
KATHMANDU, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Party of Nepal
(Unified Marxist-Leninist, CPN-UML) Friday hinted that it had
given up hope on the recovery of its ailing leader Man Mohan
Adhikari.
</P>
<P>
"We want all to be mentally prepared to accept any
eventuality," the party said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The 79-year-old leader's conditions were "extremely critical,"
the party quoted senior doctors as saying. It said it was
determined to make all efforts for his treatment.
</P>
<P>
CPN-UML General Secretary Madhav Kumar Nepal told a press
conference that Adhikari's temperature was 39.9 degrees and his
brain and kidneys did not work properly.
</P>
<P>
Doctors said there was no activity in Adhikari's brain and
about 70 percent of his kidneys had stopped functioning as well.
</P>
<P>
He has been in a state of coma since Monday morning when he
fainted all of a sudden.
</P>
<P>
He is his party's prime ministerial candidate for the election
to the House of Representatives on May 3 and May 17.
</P>

Manila, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine army said Friday it
had uncovered a plot by the rebel New People's Army (NPA) to
kidnap two children of the late former president Ferdinand Marcos.
</P>
<P>
An intelligence report by the army's 5th Infantry Division said
a 21-man NPA group has been sent to the northern province of
Ilocos Norte to carry out the mission to abduct Ferdinand Marcos,
governor of the province, and his sister, Representative Imee
Marcos.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar leapt
through the 65 U.S. cents mark to hit a 12-month high Friday as
renewed optimism about the domestic economy attracted offshore
buying interest.
</P>
<P>
During late afternoon trading a big United States-based buyer
pushed the Australian dollar as high as 65.70 U.S. cents, a one
U.S. cent gain on Thursday's close, before it settled back to end
at 65.53 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar has not visited the 65.70 U.S. cent mark
since mid-April last year.
</P>
<P>
Colonial State Bank treasury manager Nick Volanakis said that
with the Australian stock market performing strongly new investors
were interested in buying the Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
"Our stock market is very, very strong (and) there seems to be
some investment coming back into Australia."
</P>
<P>
The Australian currency closed in Sydney Thursday at 64.75 U.S.
cents and during local dealings Friday marked a low of 65.08 U.S.
cents.
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth Bank of Australia economist Michael Blythe said a
key event for the domestic currency next week would be an
International Monetary Fund meeting on Tuesday where gold sales
could be discussed.
</P>
<P>
"Any indication that these sales will proceed could
temporarily check support for the Australian dollar."
</P>
<P>
At the close the Australian dollar was buying 0.6249 euro from
0.6091 euro at Thursday's close, 78.39 Japanese yen from 77.80,
while the euro was trading at 1.0667 U.S. dollars from 1.0626 U.S.
dollars.

consultations with his counterpart Benjamin Mkapa on the crisis of
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
After hour-long talks in Dar es Salaam, Chiluba told reporters
that the consultations are aimed at accelerating the peace process
in the war-torn DRC, where rebels are fighting against President
Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Chiluba has visited South Africa, Zimbabwe, Chad,
Uganda, Rwanda and Namibia, trying for a cease-fire in DRC and
then talk about withdrawal of foreign troops from the vast central
African country, his special assistant Richard L. Sakala revealed
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents also talked about the political situation in
the sub- region and bilateral relationship. Accompanying Chiluba
was a 10-member delegation, including the Minister for Mines and
Minerals, Dr. S. K. Syamujane.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, the peace facilitator nominated by the Southern
African Development Community (SADC), said that the regional
summit on the DRC situation held last week in Libya was "in the
right direction" and marked another step forward in ending
hostilities in Africa.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, Uganda, a key player in the eight-month war,
promised to pull troops out of DRC.
</P>
<P>
The war, which broke out in early August last year, has drawn
in Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola and Chad, fighting for the government
side, and Uganda and Rwanda in support of rebels.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said he will fly to Kigali, Rwanda in a few days to
talk with President Pasteur Bizimungu about the war. He did not
mention the date for his Rwanda visit.

<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Katja Zeizinger, Germany's three-
time Olympic gold medallist, Friday announced her retirement,
according to reports.
</P>
<P>
Seizinger, the only skier to retain the Olympic downhill title,
surprised the skiing world with her announcement after a long
break through injury, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
The German suffered knee ligament damage and fractured her
tibia in a training fall on June 24 last year which meant she
missed the whole of the 1998/99 season.
</P>
<P>
She had been hoping to get fit for the 1999/2000 season and her
knee had reportedly fully recovered. She now intends however to
concentrate on her studies in economics.
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old won downhill gold in 1994 and then further
victories in downhill and the combination in Nagano four years
later.
</P>
<P>
Seizinger, who won 37 World Cup races as well as the overall
World Cup title in the 1997/98 season, was in 1998 voted German
sportswoman of the year for the third time.

MOSCOW, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Some Russian foreign ministry
officials denied allegations that "the setback in Russia's
relations with NATO are temporary," claiming they are groundless.
</P>
<P>
The officials slammed the remarks that Russia will still become

</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency quoted officials as saying that since
NATO took military actions against Yugoslavia, Russia has begun to
reconsider its relations with the alliance.
</P>
<P>
At present, Russia is concerned about the possibility of NATO's
overstepping of the United Nations and military actions outside
its jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
If NATO makes such decisions in the Washington summit, Russia
will surely take corresponding actions.

<HEADLINE> China Strengthening Training for Anesthetists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- According to China's Ministry of
Health all hospital anesthetists must have completed five years
specialized training before they can practice.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry has drawn up a plan which highlights the areas
that should be tackled such as training in clinical anesthesia,
ability to provide first aid treatment and experience in offering
pain relief treatment.
</P>
<P>
Professor Jin Qingchen from the Chinese Academy of Medical
Science's Anesthesia Branch said that increasing numbers of
Chinese medical university graduates are showing an interest in
pursuing a career as an anesthetist.
</P>
<P>
Jin disclosed that a sample survey by the Chinese Academy of
Medical Science showed that in 1996 China had over 32,000 people
working in the field of anesthesia. By 1998 Beijing had 1,070
anesthetists with over 66 percent holding bachelors' diplomas.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that the skills of anesthetists are in
geographic disparity with hospitals in remote areas lagging far
behind those in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenyang.
</P>
<P>
Anesthetists in remote areas should receive immediate in-post
training to meet the clinical demand, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Economy Resilient to Asian Crisis: Economist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 23 (Xinhua) -- China's economy will continue
to prove resilient to the Asian crisis, Stephen Roach, global
chief economist of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, a global investment
banking house, said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the conclusion of his latest global investment
research report, Roach said that the pace of Chinese economic
growth is still firm.
</P>
<P>
"Our GDP growth forecasts for China stand at 7.0 percent and 8.
2 percent for 1999 and 2000 respectively," said Roach, who engages
in the macro study on productivity, information technology,
inflation, and service sector.
</P>
<P>
On a worldwide scale, 1999 is the year of healing for the
global economy, Roach said.
</P>
<P>
"We are raising our 1999 global GDP forecast from 2 percent,
made earlier this year, to 2.4 percent and our 2000 forecast from
3.0 percent to 3.2 percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are now at a point in our forecast cycle where the upward
revisions far outweigh the downward revision, typically a sign
that the worst may be over for a world in crisis," he added.
</P>
<P>
Recognizing the benefits of China's new pragmatic economic
approach, Roach said that China's enormous savings cushion should
provide the nation with a key backstop against the perils of the
Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the mix of the Chinese economy, which is heavily
weighted towards manufacturing, utilities and communications on
the one hand, and agriculture and mining on the other, offers some
built-in insulation from Asian-related difficulties.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China's export mix is concentrated in low value-
added products, where foreign demand is relatively inelastic.
</P>
<P>
"Standing in sharp contrast to the older and more inefficient
state-owned enterprises, township and village enterprises (TVEs)
represent a significant source of growth and this growth impetus
seems set to expand, with major initiatives set to encourage the
listings of TVEs in domestic equity markets," said Roach.
</P>
<P>
Another dramatic aspect of China's current economic strength is
the continuing momentum of the pace of reform, especially in the
financial sector, Roach noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- A group of Chinese and foreign
experts and scholars today told an ongoing international seminar
on education and the Internet that developing higher professional
education in China is of great importance to the country's
educational reform.
</P>
<P>
Fu Zhengtai, a professor with Qinghua University, one of the
country's most prestigious institutes of higher education, said
that this drive is designed to meet the requirement of world's
economic and social development in the coming century.
</P>
<P>
"In China's traditional national education system, regular
higher education and the secondary professional education play the
most important parts," Fu said, adding that the country's
education sector used to consider that two kinds of education are
enough to meet the needs of the academic and professional worlds
respectively.
</P>
<P>
"With the booming scientific and technological development, the
situation has changed and the whole society needs a large number
of professionals with higher educational backgrounds as well as
practical experience and ability," the professor added.
</P>
<P>
Fu, who pays great attention to higher professional education,
set up the Haidian Open University in Beijing in early 1980s, one
of the country's earliest professional institutes.
</P>
<P>
With Fu as the head, the university has so far educated or
trained nearly 100,000 college graduate and professionals from a
variety of sectors.
</P>
<P>
Highly qualified professionals are needed in a wide range of
work environments including the administration of government
departments and enterprises and technical developments in
horticulture, interior decoration and fashion design or hair-
dressing.
</P>
<P>
"This higher professional education will become a significant
part of the national education system and become a pillar in the
modernization of society and people's life in the 21st century,"
Fu said.

Zhu Qingfang, an official with the Ministry of Personnel, said
that there are two ways for China's education to develop. One is
to improve teaching and research in key universities and
institutes for the academic aim of educating scientists and
officials for government departments and major economic and
cultural organizations.
</P>
<P>
The other is to grant stronger support in the field of higher
professional education which will provide a lot of technical
professionals or cultural officials in grassroots departments.
</P>
<P>
Steven Chan, a senior official with the American Education
Evaluation Center, said, "Professional education can be divided
into many levels," explaining as an example that the different
responsibilities and requirements for secretaries for a company
manager and state leaders are totally different.
</P>
<P>
"So we must provide a variety education programs for different
goals," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Although China now only has two levels of professional
education: secondary education and the two-year program of
professional higher education it must develop its professional
education to higher levels at the level of four-year college
education and post-graduate education," he added.
</P>
<P>
The three-day seminar, which opened on April 22, is being
sponsored jointly by the Chinese Education Association for
International Exchange, the International business University of
Beijing and the California Northwestern University of Techniques.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Four thousand troops from
Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries are taking
part in a peace-keeping exercise in Northern Cape Province, South
Africa, local daily Business Day reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The three-week exercise, dubbed operation Blue Crane, started
Thursday at the Lohatla Battle School. It is the biggest of its
kind ever held in Africa to date, and is a follow-up to operation
Blue Hungwe, which was held in Zimbabwe in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The manoeuvre is being monitored by representatives of the
United Nations, the International Red Cross and the foreign
military observers, who are advising SADC generals.
</P>
<P>
Andre Bestbier, director of Blue Crane, said the operation was
only a training exercise, and that there were no plans to
establish an official SADC peace-keeping force, which would be a
political decision.
</P>
<P>
In addition to South Africa, Botswana, Angola, Lesotho, Malawi,
 Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and
Zimbabwe are also participating in the current exercise.
</P>
<P>
Seychelles and the Democratic Republic of Congo, both joined
the SADC in 1997, were absent from the exercise.

bilateral trade and investment following the signing of an
agreement on the economic and technical joint commission during
Chinese Vice President Hu Jintao's visit to South Africa in
February this year.
</P>
<P>
The statement said China has become one of South Africa's most
important and dynamic trading partners and that two-way
investments are growing rapidly.

<HEADLINE> 120 State-Owned Firms in Ethiopia to Be Privatized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian government has
announced that preparations have been finalized to auction 120 out
of the 163 state- owned enterprises during the next three years.
</P>
<P>
The official Ethiopian Herald newspaper Friday quoted Assefa
Abraha, head of the office in charge of state-owned development
enterprises with the rank of minister, as saying that
agricultural, transport, banks and insurance enterprises will not
be included in the auction.
</P>
<P>
Assefa said an elaborate plan has been drawn for the
enterprises to local investors at reduced interest rate and on a
prolonged payment period.
</P>
<P>
Assefa announced earlier this week that 49 out of the 163
enterprises incurred a loss of nearly 34 million U.S. dollars last
year.
</P>
<P>
He said experience of the past three years has proved that
private- owned enterprises often provide better advantages for
their workers than state-owned ones and it is erroneous to assume
that it is better for a worker to stay with the government.
</P>
<P>
According to Assefa, the fate of workers in future is
determined more by the profitability of the enterprises and their
own rather than who owns the enterprises.

<P>
MAPUTO, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Drug taking among young people in
the Mozambican capital is on the rise, Mayor Artur Canana has
said.
</P>
<P>
The mayor disclosed this Thursday at a symposium aimed at
making plans on anti-drug campaign here in the capital, the
Noticias newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
A survey on 225 high school students in Maputo showed that 67
persons, that is 29.6 percent of the total, are illegally taking
cocaine, heroin, morphine and other drugs. They are mostly youths
of 15 to 18 years of age.
</P>
<P>
Reports said increasing drug addiction has led to the rise in
crime rate in the capital city. Last year, a total of 1,428 cases
of theft, 88 of murder and 1,237 cases of drug confiscation were
reported.
</P>
<P>
The mayor thus called the whole society to act against drug
addiction, and pledge support to various initiatives on reducing
and eliminating drug consumption on the part of youths.

<HEADLINE> Experts Forecast Steady Growth for Consumer Goods Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- China's consumer goods market is
expected to grow by a nominal 6.4 percent in the first half of
this year.
</P>
<P>
The projected figure represents a one percentage point down on
the same period last year and 0.6 percentage point lower than
first quarter growth, according to experts with the Commercial
Information Center attached to the National Bureau of Internal
Trade.
</P>
<P>
Consumer goods sales for the period are expected to reach 1.487
trillion yuan, with growth in urban areas continuing to outstrip
levels in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Guo Shouzhong, an official with the center, said the fact that
consumers generally show a prudent attitude when it comes to
economic prospects and fail to foresee noticeable rises in
earnings has led to a continued increase in savings deposits.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese citizens pay more as a result of various government
reform measures and thus it will be quite difficult to stimulate
consumption," said Guo.
</P>
<P>
Stimulating consumer demand, an important factor for promoting
sustained rapid economic growth, has ranked as a major issue for
China over the past year.
</P>
<P>
Real estate developers and consumer goods manufacturers have
expanded marketing efforts and a price war has erupted in the
color TV manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
The government has reduced charges for telecommunications
services and the number of mobile phone users is expected to
increase by some 15 million during 1999.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, experts fail to foresee a boom in the consumer
market until an evident upbeat trend in economic growth emerges in
coming years.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Introduces Structural Changes to Stabilize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government had
introduced structural changes that would help stabilize the
nation's economy, according to Finance Minister Mallam Ismaila
Usman.
</P>
<P>
At a two-day seminar on the stabilization of the economy held
Thursday in Enugu, eastern Nigeria, the minister said the recently
introduced Staff Monitored Program was aimed at stabilizing the
economy, The Post Express reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The program placed great emphasis on private and foreign
participation in the economy and would also address the twin
problem of unemployment and poverty in the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
The strategy for achieving these objectives, noted the
minister, included acceleration of the privatization of public
enterprises and trade liberalization.
</P>
<P>
The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) Thursday decried
the performance of Nigerian economy in the second half of 1998 at
its 28th annual general meeting being held in Lagos, saying it
witnessed stagnation.
</P>
<P>
According to the MAN, the average capacity utilization slumped
to 31 percent in the period under review, compared with 34 percent
recorded in the same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The association explained that a major debilitating factor was
the deepening energy crises including shortage of petroleum
products and epileptic power supply which disorganized industrial
and commercial activities in the most populous African country.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Publish Privatization Decree </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government will
publish the privatization decree next week to give legality to the
on-going privatization program.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing in capital Abuja Thursday, Chief of General
Staff Mike Akhigbe said, "some of the companies that may be
privatized this year will form part of the decree."
</P>
<P>
Akhigbe, chairman of the National Council on Privatization
(NCP), noted that while trying to create a conducive environment
to lure foreign investors, the government is also examining the
incentives necessary for local investors to compete with the
foreign ones.
</P>
<P>
In order to effect a transparent transaction in the
implementation of the program, the Nigerian government will take
steps including establishing necessary legal and regulatory
framework to ensure free and fair competition in affected sectors.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the government had appointed privatization
advisers to undertake diagnostic studies of affected enterprises
and had secured qualified local and foreign strategic group
investors to negotiate the purchase of 40 percent of equity
capital of the affected enterprises.
</P>
<P>
As the transaction proceeds, he noted, the council will keep
the public well informed as to who is buying what, at what price
and on what term on the implementation of the privatization
program.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalami
Abubakar said in Lagos Thursday that the commitment of his
government to the privatization program was "firm and
unquestionable".
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government has made some resources available
for the rehabilitation of the refineries and the National
Electrical Power Authority.
</P>
<P>
But, the head of state stressed that much result is not being
seen, adding that is why this administration strongly believes
only privatization can address the incidence of mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
There has been a heated controversy recently on the
appropriateness of the current military government to go ahead
with the privatization exercise a few weeks to the installation of
a civilian government in the west African country.

KATHMANDU, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Russia has called on the
Non-Aligned Movement and all its members to actively pursue
immediate termination of the use of force against Yugoslavia and
urgent return to political negotiations for the settlement of the
Kosovo problem.
</P>
<P>
In a message to the Nepalese foreign minister, a post held
concurrently by Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, Russian
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said "we consider the Non-Aligned
Movement (NAM) a weighty and influential factor of international
life."
</P>
<P>
"The contemporary world highly appreciates the efforts of the
NAM countries aimed at democratization of international relations,
building a multi-polar world, strengthening international rules of
law," Ivanov said in the message released here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign minister noted that the continued military
action of NATO against Yugoslavia has already resulted in hard
humanitarian consequences.
</P>
<P>
Innocent people including women, children and old people are
dying; dwelling houses, hospitals and schools which have no
relation with any military objects are being collapsed, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that NATO's military action against Yugoslavia has
brought the mankind up to a very dangerous bar.
</P>
<P>
"To say nothing today means to make the trouble closer to one's
own home," he warned. "Tomorrow if the situation develops
according to the logic of force, any member of international
community can find itself in Yugoslavia's shoes."

<HEADLINE> EDS-Wrap-up Wrap-Up: China, U.S. Conclude WTO Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and U.S. negotiators will
continue their talks on the remaining issues concerning China's
entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) in the future
although the current two-day talks ended without obvious results.
</P>
<P>
The two sides held three technical group discussions these two
days -- on service trade, details of China's WTO entry protocol
and the trade of textiles respectively.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noticed that the negotiations on the details of
the protocol and the textile trade both ended within one hour and
45 minutes, while the talks on service trade were held for one and
a half days.
</P>
<P>
"This indicates that negotiations on service trade might be
where the most difficult part lies," said the observer.
</P>
<P>
But, the two sides have agreed to resume talks on the remaining
issues in the future.
</P>
<P>
"China and the United States will continue talks on the
remaining issues regarding China's accession into the WTO in the
future," said Long Yongtu, chief representative for trade
negotiation of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC), after he held one-hour closed-door meeting
with U.S. Assistant Trade Representative Robert Cassidy at his
office shortly after the group discussion on service trade ended
Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said what has caused the current round of talks
to fail may be that the U.S. has been "too demanding."
</P>
<P>
The current round talks is to implement what Premier Zhu Rongji
and U.S. President Bill Clinton agreed earlier on China's entry
into WTO. They have decided to intensify the negotiations for
resolving remaining issues on China's accession to the multi-
lateral trade body by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government voiced firm support for China's entry into
the WTO this year during Zhu's visit to the United States earlier
this month, and great progress has been made in Sino-U.S.
negotiations on China's 13-year bid to join the WTO and its
predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
</P>
<P>
"The United States missed a very good chance to strike a deal
with China on WTO during Premier Zhu's visit to the U.S.," said a
MOFTEC official who participated in the current round of
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Sun Yuxi said Thursday afternoon at
a regular press conference that China has hoped to resolve the
remaining issues and reach agreements with the United States on
China's entry into the WTO as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua has learned that China will start negotiations on
China's WTO accession with the European Union next week.

<HEADLINE>   Malaysia Keen to Host World Table Tennis Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is keen to host the
45th World Table Tennis Championships next year after it was asked
to host the tournaments this year.
</P>
<P>
Chan Kong Choy, President of the Table Tennis Association of
Malaysia (TTAM) said Friday the association would submit the
bid document to the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF)
next month after seek the government's approval next week.
</P>
<P>
He said he would meet Youth and Sports Minister Muhyiddin
Yassin next week to brief him on the association's intention and
also to seek the government's approval and support.
</P>
<P>
Once the government gives its approval, the association would
submit the bid document to the ITTF before the May 15 deadline and
the ITTF executive committee would pick the host next month, Chan
said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's only contender is Sweden which had hosted the
championships twice.
</P>
<P>
Chan said the Bukit Jalil sports complex in Kuala Lumpur had
sufficient facilities to host the championships. ITTF technical
officials would visit the complex after Malaysia submitted the bid
document to check on the facilities, transportation and
accommodation, he added.
</P>
<P>
The championships was scheduled to be held in Yugoslavia this
month but was deferred by the ITTF due to the political crisis in
that country.
</P>
<P>
The ITTF asked Malaysia to host the championship this year but
the TTAM turned down the offer due to time constraints and
requested that the championships be held early next year.
</P>
<P>
Chan said the World Championships had been scheduled from
February 12 to 20 and the association had projected a budget of 5.
5 million ringgit(about 1.447 million U.S. dollars) to host the
championship with 40 percent of the amount to be subsidized by the
ITTF from television rights.
</P>
<P>
Chan said the ITTF had signed an agreement with the ESPN
television network and the championship would get about 60 hours
airtime coverage to be channelled worldwide.
</P>
<P>

BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) --The Sino-Satellite Monitoring and

conducted by a group of aerospace experts.
</P>
<P>
This means that China now has the ability to monitor and

</P>
<P>
The station was designed and built by the Beijing Tracking and
Communications Institute with all works completed by Chinese
technicians and has been operational for nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhao Yefu, who is in charge of the project, the
station will provide technical guarantees for satellites during
its planned operational life of 18 years.
</P>
<P>
In the process of building the station, revealed Zhao, Chinese
scientists have also successfully developed a system that can send
monitoring and control data simultaneously to a remote place.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF to Help China Fight Trafficking of Women. Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- A campaign to stop the evil
world trafficking in women and children was launched in Beijing
today by UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund).
</P>
<P>
Part of the campaign is also aimed at helping the Chinese
government protect the rights of the country's women and children.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy said that today's
launch provides a great opportunity to eliminate this vicious
trade and will become a beacon for all the millions of caring
families in China. Though it will be a great challenge UNICEF is
optimistic that this project means a big step forward for both it
and China into the 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy highly praised the Chinese government's efforts in
achieving the 2000 target for children's issues. She stressed that
UNICEF will cooperate with relevant Chinese departments in
improving the rural environment, reducing the mortality of newly-
born babies, reducing the mortality of pregnant women, adding
iodine to salt for the Chinese people, and AIDs control.
</P>
<P>
"Eliminating the trafficking of children and women is a new
line of UNICEF work. I hope this pioneering project in China will
contribute to UNICEF's regional and global capacity as we make
similar efforts in other countries," said Bellamy.
</P>
<P>
She also looked forward to this project bringing to China-
UNICEF cooperation a renewed focus on the root causes of problems
affecting children and women in China, and ways to create
conditions for the rights of children and women to be
progressively realized and guaranteed.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Free Trade Zone Opens in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwait Free Trade Zone
(KFTZ) will be officially opened in July this year, KFTZ
Director-General Juhail Al-Juhail said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The zone, which was previously planned to be completed last
March, is ready for opening now, Juhail told Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said the opening of a 10,000-square-meter exhibition center
in the zone will be the highlight of the official inauguration.
</P>
<P>
Goods and commodities from around the world will be on display
at the center through a special entrance without customs.
</P>
<P>
Part of the zone went into operation in March last year, said
Juhail.
</P>
<P>
During the operation period, he said, necessary licenses were
issued, contracts were signed and warehouses to over 40 local and
western investors were delivered.
</P>
<P>
He noted the KFTZ was different from its counterparts
worldwide because it received applications from both local and
foreign investors, whereas foreign free trade zones started with
locals and then foreigners after one or two years.
</P>
<P>
The KFTZ is located in the country's largest port of
Al-Shuwaikh which is close to Kuwait City. Construction work of
the zone began in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the KFTZ is aimed at promoting trade
between Kuwait and its neighboring countries. It is also seeking
to attract foreign investors by expanding its operations into the
Iranian and central Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
The KFTZ, which is to be managed by Kuwait's National Real
Estate Company, will offer tax-free investment opportunities to
re-export and light industrial companies.
</P>
<P>
It will also issue import-export licenses to related companies
within hours and offer health insurance and legal consultations
to any projects in the zone.

<P>
JERUSALEM, April (Xinhua) -- A liver donated by the family of a
37-year-old Palestinian man has been divided into two and
transplanted into the bodies of two Israeli patients, according to
a report obtained here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in Israel that a donated liver was
split for two recipients, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Six internal organs from the Palestinian man who were from the
West Bank, including his heart, kidney and a liver, were
transplanted into four different patients at an Israeli hospital
last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A 7-year-old girl from northern Israel and a 50-year-old father
of seven from the south shared the liver, the report said. The
girl, who suffers from a genetic liver disease, also received a
kidney of the Palestinian man.
</P>
<P>
Doctors performing the transplant said the two livers are
functioning well.
</P>
<P>
They said the splitting of a single liver between two patients
is a breakthrough in light of the dire shortage of donated organs
in Israel this year.

<P>
PARIS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- France said on Friday that it is
reinforcing security measures at home because of the war in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement said the anti-
terrorist "Vigipirate" operation will be reinforced from Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said the government wants to step up precaution measures by
sending more troops to guard sensitive areas like railway stations
and calling for stricter security measures in places like big
shops.
</P>
<P>
But he denied that the war in Yugoslavia will have a major
impact on the security of France, although it is surely having "
repercussions" here.
</P>
<P>
"The risk remains weak," said Chevenement at a press briefing
in his ministry.
</P>
<P>
The "Vigipirate" operation, first designed by the French
government in 1978, is aimed at preventing any risk of attacks in
France through a reinforcement of surveillance and intelligence.

the World Trade Organization (WTO) in the future although the
current two-day talks concluded without obvious results, Xinhua

<HEADLINE> UK Police Say Racism Likely Motive Behind London Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- British police said on Friday that
three more far-right racist groups had claimed responsibility for
a bombing in south London last week.
</P>
<P>
The nail bomb attack took place last Saturday evening in a busy
market street in the south London suburb of Brixton, which has a
large black population.
</P>
<P>
Combat 18, a small racist organization, has already claimed
responsibility for the blast which injured nearly 40 people.
</P>
<P>
"We are exploring every motive, but top of our list, I have to
say, is the race issue," commander Hugh Orde, who is in charge of
police investigation, told BBC radio.
</P>
<P>
Police said they were also investigating the suggestion that
the bomber may have had a different target from the Brixton
supermarket.
</P>
<P>
Many community leaders in Brixton are convinced that the bomb
was directly aimed at the local black population.
</P>
<P>
Racial tension in London rose sharply in February after an
inquiry slammed the city's police for their handling of an
investigation into the fatal stabbing of an 18-year-old black man,
Stephen Lawrence, in 1993.

<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of Chinese trade experts
and entrepreneurs from export companies gathered at a seminar here
on Friday to explore ways to tackle the decline in China's exports
in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
They represented several central departments and leading
Chinese exporters like the China National Chemicals Import and
Export Corporation, the China National Technology Import and
Export Corporation, and research institutes such as the
International Trade Association of China and the University of
International Trade and Economics.
</P>
<P>
Topics for discussion at the three-day seminar included
international trade and China's foreign trade situation, e-
commerce in foreign trade, trade barriers and export rebates,
among others.
</P>
<P>
Some participants suggested that China step up its efforts to
diversify the export market and to revitalize exports by making
use of new technology. They said e-commerce should also be used
widely to help expand the export market.
</P>
<P>
China's exports declined 7.9 percent in the first three months
of this year to 37.27 billion U.S. dollars. The export volume for
1998 grew only 0.5 percent on 1997, largely due to the Asian
financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Asia's Deepest Oil Well Crosses Thick Oil Layer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, April 23 (Xinhua) -- A rich oil and gas reservoir was
recently verified in the lower part of the 7,200-meter-deep Tacan-
1 Oil Well in the Tarim Basin located in northwest China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The layer, some 100 meters thick, was discovered at a depth of
between 7,100 and 7,200 meters, according to Wang Yiqing, deputy
chief engineer with the Tarim Oil Production Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The well, the deepest in Asia, is located on a large oil and
gas bearing formation. The drilling operation is designed to
search for protogenic oil and gas reserves in systems dating to
the Ordovician and Cambrian periods, as well as to determine the
process involving oil and gas accumulation in the area.
</P>
<P>
Three oil and gas fields have been verified in the area
surrounding Tacan-1 over the past three years. The Tazhong-4 Oil
Field, the largest, has proven reserves of over 100 million tons
of crude.
</P>
<P>
Technical data gained from the well provides a basis for
verifying oil and gas reserves and will pave the way for drilling
super-deep wells in the future, said Wang.

<HEADLINE> Modeling Agents Strive to Set Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of models competing for
fat fees, often through under the table deals, have forced Chinese
agents to step up self-regulation by adopting international
standards.
</P>
<P>
New Silk Road Models Inc., the largest and most prestigious
modeling agency in China, signed contracts with 32 Chinese models
this week. All are prize winners both in China and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Li Xiaobai, general manager of the company, said that signing
of the contracts marked the introduction of a French style
management system for the company. Lawyers have drawn up the
contracts so as to guarantee the interests of relevant parties.
</P>
<P>
He said that this is aimed at introducing more fair play in the
trade.
</P>
<P>
Since re-emerging a dozen years ago, modeling has grown across
China and at present there are more than 1,000 professionals and
nearly 10,000 part-timers all competing for the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
However, a number of unscrupulous models or agents are trying to
win contracts through illegal methods such as bribery.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the lack of universal professional standards
has caused the problem, according to Li who added that many models
fail to have professional qualifications.
</P>
<P>
He said that New Silk Road Models Inc. wishes to set an example
to the trade by adopting international management standards.
</P>
<P>
"We should not rely on the government to regulate the
professional market. Instead, we must strengthen self-regulation
and establish professional and authoritative standards," he said.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang's Foreign Trade Grows in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The foreign trade volume of
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region registered a 52 percent rise in
the first quarter of this year to reach 264 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Its exports increased by 71 percent at 114 million U.S. dollars
and imports totaled 150 million dollars, up 40 percent over last
year's same period.
</P>
<P>
Both Xinjiang's import and export growth rates were much higher
than the national average in the period, said a local trade
official.
</P>
<P>
As Xinjiang borders with eight countries, the import and export
value of small trade transactions at border areas soared to 159
million U.S. dollars in the first quarter, 1.3 times the figure of
a year ago. Border trade between Xinjiang and five central Asian
countries and Russia made up half of the region's total foreign
trade volume.
</P>
<P>
Local foreign trade officials predicted the region's exports
will continue to rise in the second quarter.

BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- China reiterated its strong
opposition to any move that may directly or indirectly incorporate
Taiwan into the so-called "areas surrounding Japan," said Chinese
Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi here today.
</P>
<P>
Sun made the statement while responding to a reporter who asked

"China has time and again expressed its strong concern over the

government would observe its solemn commitment on the Taiwan issue
and properly handle the problems related to Taiwan in relevant
resolutions now under consideration," he said, stressing that
Japan "would not do anything that infringes upon China's
sovereignty and interfere in its internal affairs."

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus Stock Market plunged
below the 600-point level last week for the first time since April
8, a weekly market review said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The review, issued by the Cyprus Investment and Securities
Corporation Limited (CISCO), said the CISCO All-Share Index closed
at 587.9 points Thursday, a weekly retreat of 15.4 points or 2.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
The dive was mainly caused by the technical adjustments in the
share price of the Bank of Cyprus, which is trading ex-warrants
and ex-bonus from Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Investment was much more active than last week with the average
daily volume surpassing 5 million Cyprus pounds (10 million
U.S. dollars) as compared to approximately 3.8 million Cyprus
pounds (7.6 million dollars) the week before.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Urges More Trade with Other SADC States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 23 (Xinhua) -- A senior South African
official has said that the development of a strong industrial base
in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) is vital for
the future growth of the region.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Johannesburg Chamber of Commerce and
Industry-SADC free trade agreement breakfast Thursday, South
African Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin said that for the
region to prosper, his country would have to make its market
accessible to its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"It is important that South Africa should neither look at its
neighbors as a threat, nor should its neighbors do the same with
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Trade within the region is a building block. If we have a
fear of trade among ourselves, it will mean fear for world trade,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Trade valued at 2.2 billion rand (about 367 million U.S.
dollars) took place in the region last year and this was rapidly
growing, Erwin said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the 14-SADC member countries are on the
verge of finalizing a free trade agreement which is expected to
come into effect next year.
</P>
<P>
Erwin said he hoped a formal agreement would be reached in six
months, noting this would facilitate a speedy move toward a free
trade zone where tariffs can be scrapped.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Warned against Malaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaria will continue to be a
major threat to public health in Kenya if not checked, a senior
medical official has warned.
</P>
<P>
The tropical scourge accounts for more than 30 percent of all
admissions in hospital, exerting negative impact on the Kenyan
economy, said Julius Meme, director of Medical Services of Kenyan
Health Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Meme emphasized that it was critical and urgent to educate
rural residents on the need to control the disease so as to cut
the costs of treating.
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard newspaper Friday quoted Meme as
saying that the amount of funds spent on fighting the disease had
increased tremendously in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Malaria has recurred strongly in this east African country as a
result of the emergency of stronger parasites resistant to
medicines on the market, said Meme in Nairobi at an international
meeting on malaria control.
</P>
<P>
The disease kills about 72 Kenyan children daily while another
5.1 million Kenyans of all ages are afflicted by the disease
annually, he said.
</P>
<P>
More than 111 representatives from 14 African countries and
Yemen participated in the four-day international meeting on
malaria control which closed Thursday. They had analyzed the
spread of malaria in Africa and worked out strategies to curb the
top killer disease in Africa.

<HEADLINE> Mild Seven Outdoor Quest Returns to Dali, China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Mild Seven Outdoor Quest (
MSOQ), Asia's premier adventure race, returns to Dali, China from
July 29 to August 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
China has twice hosted the international adventure race, with
the inaugural race held in Xichang of southwest China's Sichuan
Province in 1997. Last year's race moved to Dali, capital city of
the Dali Bai Autunomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
This year's race has attracted a field of 24 teams, with some
of the world's top-class adventure racers returning to the
southwestern Chinese city.
</P>
<P>
"Dali is the ideal location for the MSOQ," said Don Baker, race
course designer. "This beautiful town has the infrastructure,
mountains, altitude, climate, and the support of the people - all
things that made the 1998 MSOQ the one competition the world's top
adventure athletes flocked to - but this year's event will push
competitors even further," he predicted.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 MSOQ is a four-day team competition. Four-member
teams, each having at least one woman, contest such events as
mountain biking, off-road inline skating, trail running, kayaking,
lake paddling and adventure skills. Teams race together at all
times. The groundbreaking MSOQ takes the same format as the Tour
de France cycle race. Teams contest different courses and events
each day, with the team with lowest elapsed time after four days
of competition is declared the winners.
</P>
<P>
Dali's blue skies provided the ideal backdrop for the 1998 MSOQ,
as 24 teams of the finest adventure athletes, including world
champions like eight-time Hawaiian Ironman Triathlon champion
Paula Newby-Fraser, 1998 Raid Gauloises endurance champions Team
Eco-Internet, and Olympic gold medalist Isabelle Mir, pushed
themselves to their mental, emotional and physical limits.
</P>
<P>
Team Polar Spirit of Finland outshone others in last year's
race. "I think the fact the Dali was so much like home played a
crucial role in our successful racing," said a memnber of Team
Polar Spirit. "The blue skies, white cloudss and mountains are
all very beautiful and very natural for us. I can't think of a
better place to race," the athlete added.
</P>
<P>
Team Mild Seven, which consists a group of elite Chinese
athletes trained by Don Baker, took the sixth place in the last
two years.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Liuzhou, a leading industrial
City in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, used to be
acknowledged as one of the three serious acid rain areas in the
country, but its environmental conditions have improved
dramatically in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"Now People don't need to close windows to keep out the dust
like before," said a Mrs. Wang, a local resident, who added that
her bicycle does not now get as rusty.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen Xueming, director of the city's environmental
protection bureau, Liuzhou has required all enterprises adding to
the pollution of the region to install proper controls and reduce
emissions, even closing some of them because they failed to
protect the environment effectively.
</P>
<P>
An investment of 210 million yuan has been poured into a
project which will replace coal with cooking gas as the source of
energy for local residents. Four air quality supervision spots
have also been built in the city.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to these efforts, the amount of sulfur dioxide in the
air has decreased by 72,100 tons since 1996, and the air pollution
index has reached what is termed as a "good" level 70 percent of
the time.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Power Shortage Persists in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has been facing an acute
power shortage this year, and prospects of improvement in power
supply remain bleak and distant.
</P>
<P>
Loadshedding, or blackouts, has become more frequent in the
capital city during the last two weeks because of the breakdown of
two circuit breakers.
</P>
<P>
To protest the power crisis, the country's major opposition
parties on Thursday gheraoed the office of the Power Development
Board (PDB), the state-owned power producing organization in the
country, in Dhaka and electricity offices across the country, with
some 20 people injured during clashes with the police and
anti-hartal activists.
</P>
<P>
And two weeks ago, thousands of residents in the old part of
the Dhaka city took to the streets demanding an immediate end to
electricity and water shortage.
</P>
<P>
The aging and inadequate infrastructure of power stations,
sub-stations, and the transmission lines were responsible for the
shortage of power supply, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The shortage of power, however, was partially a result of
corrupt practices, such as electricity pilferage though illegal
connections, meter tampering and under-billing, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The overall system loss in the country's state-run power sector
stood at about 30 percent at present, with about 16 percent from
technical loss (generation, transmission and distribution) and the
rest 14 percent caused by the corrupt practices.
</P>
<P>
The official peak demand of power in the franchise area of the
Dhaka Electricity Supply Authority (DESA), which purchases and
supplies power in Dhaka, was approximately 1,100 mw, but on the
connected load basis, the demand in Dhaka was actually 1,350 mw,
with the difference turned into "system loss" and pirated by DESA
officials and some users, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, electricity bills amounting to nearly 30 billion
taka (about 625 million U.S. dollars) remained outstanding,
according to the PDB, affecting the installation of new power
units and rehabilitation as well as overhaul of several old ones.
</P>
<P>
"At least five new power stations with a total of 500 mw
capacity could be commissioned in the country and the gap between
demand and supply of electricity be narrowed if the arrears are
realized," a PDB official said. The highest amount of 18.58
billion taka (about 387 million dollars) remained pending with the
DESA till December last year, which was equivalent to its bills
for 26 months.
</P>
<P>
To tackle the power crisis, the government has asked the DESA
and the PDB to take crash programs to save 100 mw and 50-100 mw
electricity respectively by thrift measures at all costs by April
30. The programs include severing unauthorized lines and
collecting all arrears of three months and above by the end of
this month.
</P>
<P>
Under the programs, anyone failing to pay the arrears in time
will have their power lines cut off, and factories failing to
install power factor improvement devices by the month-end will
also lose their power lines.
</P>
<P>
To deal with illegal connections, the government has also set
up 65 mobile courts. Some 1,771 illegal connections were snapped
in December last year, and 77 unauthorized consumers have been
sent to jail.
</P>
<P>
But the situation was not likely to improve before the end of
November when winter begins and the demand drops, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Load-shedding will remain a common phenomenon in Bangladesh for
the time being, where the available power generation capacity is
only 1,900-2,000 mw against the peak hour requirement of 2,300 mw
and the installed capacity for power generation of 3,091 mw,
observers said.

<HEADLINE> China's Flagship Container Company Becomes World's Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- China's flagship container
shipping company looks set to overtake its worldwide rivals in
terms of container output this year with expected TEU at 430,000.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made in the China International Ocean
Shipping Container (Group) Co. Ltd's annual report which was
released today.
</P>
<P>
Based in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, the group sold 335,600
TEU containers last year and the output reached 330,400 TEU,
accounting for 38 percent of China's container production and 26
percent of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
The company had a turnover of 491 million yuan and earned 246
million yuan in profits last year, up 14.4 percent and 26.6
percent year on year amidst intensified international container
competition.
</P>
<P>
It is planning for increased production capacity in terms of
merchandise containers and cold storage containers, as four merger
plans are on its agenda for this year: with the Qingdao China
Container Co., Qingdao China Cold Storage Container Co., Shanghai
Far-East Co. and Tianjin Beiyang Container Co.
</P>
<P>
In order to meet the increasingly strong demand for timber
products, the container company has invested 30 million U.S.

HANGZHOU, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Jinhua-Wenzhou railway

100 meters after engineers took emergency measures and hit a large
mound of rock and dirt resulting from a landslide caused by recent
heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
The locomotive, a luggage car and four passenger cars run out
of the rail, and about 180 meters of rail were heavily damaged.
Six passengers were slightly injured.

<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- NATO ground troops will enter Yugoslavia with or without
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's permission, said British
Prime Minister Tony Blair on Thursday, declaring: "Success is the

</P>

<HEADLINE> Marriages to Foreign Women Cause Social </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
is now facing many social problems caused by marriages between
national men and foreign women, the Gulf News daily reported on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Citing one of the social problems, the paper said, children are
badly affected culturally, which makes them feel confused and
difficult to adapt to the society.
</P>
<P>
"Children aged between six and 12 years, whose mothers are
foreigners, suffer depression, anxiety, uneasiness, academic
backwardness and obesity," said Dr. Khalifa Al Quti, head of
Preventive Medicine at Sharjah Medical Zone.
</P>
<P>
He said at least 80 percent of the problems suffered by
the children were the result of their inability to adjust to
life in the UAE.
</P>
<P>
A Ministry of Health study concludes that 90 percent of UAE
children in juvenile detention centers are the result of
marriages between national men and foreign women.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, with UAE youngsters going abroad to study,
the incidence of marriage to foreign women has been climbing
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, nearly 47 percent of UAE men married women from
India, Egypt, Iran, Thailand, Tanzania, China, the Philippines,
Somalia and other foreign countries. In 1998, the figure dropped
to 28 percent, but is still alarming.
</P>
<P>
Besides the harmful effects on children, marriages involving
foreign women also caused other social problems such as the
high rate of divorces.
</P>
<P>
"At least 60 percent of such marriages ended in divorce,"
said Jamal Al Bah, head of the Marriage Fund. "The impact of
this problem on the economy and the society is becoming quite
profound," the doctor added.
</P>
<P>
He said the number of UAE spinsters reached 35,000 in
1995 because of the high number of UAE men marrying foreign
women.
</P>
<P>
He urged the UAE government to draw up a strategy to curb
marriages to foreign women, or issue a law forbidding such
marriages.

<HEADLINE> Blair: Air Strikes Continue Until NATO Demands Fully Met </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said on Friday that the air strikes would be intensified until
NATO's demands are completely met.
</P>
<P>
"It may be an indication of changes in (Yugoslav President
Slobodan) Milosevic's position but we just don't know enough about
the details of this yet. In any event, the NATO demands are clear
and they have to be met," he told BBC Radio on his visit to the
United States for NATO's 50th anniversary celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Specifying NATO's demands to Milosevic, Blair said: "He has to
get his forces and his paramilitaries and his military apparatus
out of Kosovo and those people (Kosovo refugees) have got to be
allowed back to their homes and towns and villages under the
security of an international force."
</P>
<P>
"We have got to carry on with this air campaign and intensify
it until these demands are met," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian president's special envoy on Yugoslavia,
Viktor Chernomyrdin, said on Friday he was ready to travel to meet
NATO leaders after winning what he described as an agreement from
Milosevic to allow "an international presence" in Yugoslavia's
Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
Blair said, "I spoke to (Russian) President Yeltsin yesterday,
I will be in touch with Mr Chernomyrdin and of course we have
always wanted a political solution to this, a diplomatic solution
if you will, but it has got to be on the right terms and those
terms are the terms set out in the NATO demands."

<P>
But the lease of land may be extended, with no more than 10
years for each extension. In both rent and leases, the Government
must sign a land lease contract with the party concerned to define
the rights and obligations of both parties to the contract.
</P>
<P>
With the approach of the transfer of government in Macao, both
the rent of the land with an infinite land use period and the land
leases with a fixed term involve the issue of the land terms
extending beyond Dec. 19 1999.
</P>
<P>
To assure those people who are concerned about their land use
contracts signed with the Portuguese Macao Government before the
establishment of the Macao Special Administrative Region and
encourage them to develop and use the land and promote the economy
in Macao, Article 120 of the Basic Law stipulates that the Macao
Special Administrative Region shall, in accordance with law,
recognize and protect all the lawful leases of land granted or
decided upon before the establishment of the Macao Special
Administrative Region which extend beyond December 19, 1999, and
all rights in relation to such leases.
</P>
<P>
As for the new land rents or leases or renewal of the old land
leases after the establishment of the Macao Special Administrative
Region, they shall be dealt with in accordance with the relevant
land laws and policies of the Region.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ABCs of Macao SAR Basic Law (48) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Following is part 48 of a
question and answer series on the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
Can religious organizations, community organizations and
private residents continue to run educational undertakings after
the return of Macao?
</P>
<P>
Education in Macao has developed quite fast in the last two
decades or so. At present, there are 189 schools in Macao,
including 69 pre-school centers, 80 primary schools and 40 middle
schools.
</P>
<P>
In addition, there are four institutions of higher learning.
They are the University of Macao, the Institute of Polytechnic of
Macao, the Superior School of the Security Forces of Macao and the
Asian (Macao) International Open University.
</P>
<P>
Macao has practiced a plural educational system with private
schools as its mainstay. Under this system, churches, community
organizations and private citizens have set up all types of
schools.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the number of private schools is six times that
of public-funded schools. Schools in Macao, private ones in
particular, enjoy much decision-making authority. They may choose
teaching materials and employ teachers on their own.
</P>
<P>
The total schooling for primary and secondary education in
Macao varies from 12 years to 13 years. Chinese, or Portuguese
and English may all be used in teaching, but most schools opt for
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
In line with the policy of "one country, two systems" and in
the light of the actual conditions in Macao, the Basic Law
provides that community organizations and individuals as well as
religious organizations may, in accordance with law, run
educational undertakings of various kinds.
</P>
<P>
For religious organizations, they may also set up institutions
of religious education and offer religious courses in accordance
with law.
</P>
<P>
It is also provided that the existing schools in Macao may
continue to operate in the Macao Special Administrative Region.
They may continue to enjoy decision-making authority and freedom
in teaching and academic research in accordance with law.
</P>
<P>
They may also recruit staff and use teaching materials from
outside the Macao Special Administrative Region. Undoubtedly, the
rights of the religious organizations, community organizations and
private persons to run schools will be fully protected by the
Basic Law and other laws of the Macao Special Administrative
Region, after the return of Macao.
</P>
<P>
Can students from the educational institutions of the Macao
Special Administrative Region pursue education on the mainland?
</P>
<P>
Article 122 of the Basic Law stipulates that students shall
enjoy freedom of choice of educational institutions and freedom to
purse their education outside the Macao Special Administrative
Region.
</P>
<P>
Clearly, students of the Macao Special Administrative Region
may seek education not only on the mainland, but also in other
countries or regions. In fact, many middle school or university
students from Macao are studying in mainland colleges and
universities to do bachelor, masters or even Ph.D courses.
</P>
<P>
It is certain that after the return of Macao, more students
from Macao will pursue education in educational institutions on
the mainland, which, on their part, will try their best to provide
better conditions for the studies.
</P>
<P>
But for people from the mainland who wish to study in the Macao
Special Administrative Region, they will need to go through
necessary procedures in accordance with law, as the Region enjoys
a higher degree of autonomy. Therefore, there will be a limit on
the acceptance of applications by mainland students for studying
in Macao.

<P>
PARIS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- NATO will celebrate its 50th anniversary in Washington on
Friday in a sober atmosphere. At the insistence of the Europeans,
an air show, evening parties and concerts by Celine Dion or
Barbara Streisand have been canceled. French President Jacques
Chirac will not attend a banquet at the White House hosted by
President Bill Clinton in honor of 44 heads of state, including
those of 19 NATO member countries.
</P>
<P>
-- The question of a ground intervention in Kosovo, which NATO
has not excluded, will dominate the debate at the Washington
summit of the alliance. France said on Thursday that it does not
oppose an "updating" of the plans for a ground intervention to
impose a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- NATO destroyed the residence of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic one day before the opening of a summit in Washington by
NATO leaders, who will debate a possible ground intervention by
the allied troops in Yugoslavia, and to mark the 50th anniversary
of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
-- According to analysts, a NATO ground intervention in Kosovo
could have three scenarios: a limited attack at the frontier of
Kosovo, an invasion and capture of Kosovo, and the most radical
and most improbable of all, an invasion of Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: NATO's New Strategy, Part of U.S. Global Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Leaders from 19 members of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) are meeting here from
Friday to Sunday to mark the 50th anniversary of the alliance.
High on the agenda will be the organization's new strategy.
</P>
<P>
One of the key points of the strategy will be new missions for
the alliance -- involving military operations outside the alliance
territory, or interfering in the internal affairs of the non-NATO
countries.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that NATO's new strategy is the principal part
of the U.S. global strategy, which is to keep its dominance and
build a single-polar world order in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The alliance was set up in 1949 after a treaty was signed in
Washington. Commitment of the members to defend from attack, or "
collective defense," is the nucleus of the treaty. The Cold War
started as confrontation then began between NATO and its adversary-
- the Warsaw Pact, which was set up in 1955.
</P>
<P>
NATO's strategy in the Cold War was to deal with the threat
from the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, the Cold War ended, with both the Soviet Union and the
Warsaw Pact breaking up. But NATO did not go away. It started a
new strategy: accept new members, develop partnership with
neighbors, expand its missions into territories outside the
alliance, and prepare for field forces designed and equipped for
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The evolution of the alliance's strategy reflects the change of
the U.S. security strategy. NATO, which used to be Washington's
main tool to confront the Soviet Union during the Cold War era,
was chosen as a new weapon by the United States to dominate Europe
and even the world.
</P>
<P>
The United States, the only superpower, vowed to lead the world
in the next century, attempting to impose American values and
political system on others. It believes that keeping its dominance
in the Asia-Pacific region and Europe is a key to success.
</P>
<P>
In Asia-Pacific, the United States strengthened its military
alliance with Japan and South Korea while engaging with China. In
Europe, it mapped out an expansion plan for the alliance, set
forth new missions for NATO to survive in the post-Cold War era.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the United States is to integrate European countries
and cripple Russia, which the Americans still regard as a
potential adversary.
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday's NATO guarded our borders against military
aggression. Tomorrow's alliance must continue to safeguard our
shared security while contending with new threats that recognize
no borders -- the spread of weapons of mass destruction, ethnic
violence and regional conflict," U.S. President Bill Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Under the new strategy, NATO will seek to interfere in other
countries' internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Running against the international norms and the charter of the
United Nations, NATO's new strategy, which was manipulated by the
U.S., poses great threat to the world peace and serious challenges
to the United Nations. It will certainly meet opposition from
peace-loving countries, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
The analysts also believe that the U.S. strategy to build a
single-polar world order goes against the historical trend of the
world's multi-polarization and is due to fail.

MOSCOW -- Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko stressed
Thursday that Yugoslavia's application for joining the Russia-
Belarus Union will not lead to the involvement of Belarus and
Russia in the present Balkan conflict.
</P>
<P>
War is not the reason for Yugoslavia to apply for the entry
into the union, because the country had raised its application
long ago, Lukashenko told Interfax in Osipovichi, a city in
central Belarus. Belarus and Russia have so far insisted
Yugoslavia first become an observer of the union parliament. (

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Stock Market Sees Sharp Fall in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's only stock market
Beirut Stock Exchange saw a total value of transactions at 33.24
million U.S. dollars in the first quarter of this year, a sharp
drop compared with 105 million dollars for the same period of
last year.
</P>
<P>
The fall in business represented a drop of 69 percent over the
figure in the first quarter of 1998, the Daily Star reported
Friday, adding the number of shares traded fell to 4.58 million,
a drop of 56 percent.
</P>
<P>
These figures came after a disappointing year in 1998 when the
value of shares traded on the stock exchange fell by nearly 50
percent compared with 1997.
</P>
<P>
In its first quarter report, the bourse said trading activity
during March 1999 remained stable with a volume of 1.8 milion
shares valued at 14.3 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The market capitalization at the end of the month totaled
1.853 billion dollars, a drop of 4 percent on the figures
of the previous month, the report addedd.
</P>
<P>
Gabriel Sehnaoui, the bourse chairman, said the continuing fall
in the value and volume of trading was due to the economic
situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Many investors are awaiting the disclosure of the
government's five-year plan before making any move," the chairman
said.
</P>
<P>
He added business groups reacted positively to the 1999 budget
but they still needed move details.
</P>
<P>
"We want more explanations in the budget because it will
give an incentive for investors to buy shares," Sehnaoui said.
</P>
<P>
The government this month announced an austerity budget bill
which introduced a wide range of new taxes in a bid to
generate revenues and stem a chronic budget deficit forecast
at 40.2 percent of spending this year.
</P>
<P>
It said the budget will be accompanied by a five-year plan to
curb the 18 billion dollars debt that is one of the highest per
capita in the world and a deficit blamed for weak economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are a total of 11 companies, mostly
financial groups, are listed in the Beirut Stock Exchange for
trading.

<HEADLINE> Kunming Horticulture Exposition to Promote Border Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Border trade in Yunnan Province
is expected to be boosted by the '99 International Horticulture
Exposition, which is due to open on May 1 in Kunming, the
province's capital.
</P>
<P>
In the first three months of this year, the province's border
trade with Viet Nam, Laos and Myanmar, its neighboring countries,
reached 50 million U.S. dollars, triple that of the same period of
1997.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Yunnan's import and export volume with the
aforementioned countries stood at 140 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan shares a border line of more than 4,000 kilometers with
Viet Nam, Laos and Myanmar and residents in the border areas of
Yunnan and these countries have traditionally traded with one
another throughout history.
</P>
<P>
Since China adopted its opening policy in 1979 border trade in
Yunnan has been developing rapidly and now accounts for half of
the nation's total trade volume with the three countries.
</P>
<P>
The main products exported are textiles, chemicals, machinery
and electronic products, and light industrial products. Imports
are usually timber, medicines, minerals, and aquatic and
agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to promote trade exchanges with Yunnan, Viet Nam,
Laos and Myanmar will send large delegations to attend the Kunming
horticulture exposition, which is expected to spur regional
economic cooperation in the area.

URUMQI, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Bad weather battered northwest
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region today, sending the
temperature crashing by a dozen degrees.
</P>
<P>
Winds reached strong or gale force and in parts hurricane force
with a high 22.l7 mm snowfall in Wusu City. The temperature in
Urumqi, the regional capital, was minus 2.2 degrees this morning
compared with the maximum of 24 degrees Celsius a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
Three trains running in southern Xinjiang were delayed by the
hurricane at 03:30 today. Local government and railway departments
took emergency measures to look after the 1,500 passengers
stranded on the trains.
</P>
<P>
The Xinjiang Aviation Administration has canceled all light
aircraft passenger flights on routes linking Urumqi with Hetian
and Lanzhou respectively.
</P>
<P>
The cold wave is to linger in the region for three or four days
and will cause windy weather and a drop in temperature across
large tracts of northern China, according to local meteorological
bureau.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the snow is beneficial for the arid Xinjiang region,
especially for the growth of wheat and sugar beet but fruit
growers in Ili Prefecture have seen their fruit harvest ruined by
the wind and snow.

<HEADLINE> Construction Bank Improves Profitability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the China
Construction Bank (CCB) said today that the institution's profits
have gradually turned for the better in terms of both accounting
statistics and comparisons with previous periods.
</P>
<P>
The CCB spokesman made the comments during a press conference
on the bank's profit conditions in 1998.
</P>
<P>
He said that last year's paper profits hit 2.21 billion yuan,
up 46.3 percent on 1997, with net profits for 1998 standing at 860
million yuan after deducting the increase interest receivable.
</P>
<P>
"The bank's profitability has obviously improved in spite of
declining net profits compared to 1997," according to the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Profitability refers to a bank's ability of earn profits in
spite of the fact that constantly falling interest rates lead to
shrinking margins. Six interest rate reduction since 1996 has
narrowed the margin between deposits and loans.
</P>
<P>
Accounting on the CCB's deposits and loans structure, the 1.7
percentage point drop in the 1998 margin for CCB's deposits and
loans structure lowered the bank's income by some eight billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
The CCB increased its reserves for bad debts by 7.9 billion
yuan in 1998 in order to minimize risk. Therefore, the bank's net
profits should have been 6.4 billion yuan, or 266 percent, more
than in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that a number of factors will restrict the
bank's profit growth for this year, including the shrinking margin
resulting from falling interest rates, the increase in due bills
for interest payable, the large volume of bad loans which will be
written off and increased costs for restructuring.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the CCB will strengthen internal controls and
will make every effort to increase income and reduce costs in a
bid to fulfill the target for increased profits.

JERUSALEM, April 23 (Xinhua) - The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli security cabinet decided in a special meeting
Thursday to issue closure orders against three Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) offices in the Orient House in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Nepal Increasingly Depends on Foreign Aid: ADB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 23 (Xinhua) -- As overall economic performance
did not show improvement in recent years, Nepal is increasingly
dependent on foreign aid, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Development Outlook 1999 released by the bank noted
that the share of foreign assistance in Nepal's total development
expenditures had declined from about 60 percent in the late 1980s
to some 50 percent in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
"But this had regained its previous high levels by 1998, and is
expected to continue to rise in 1999 to more than 65 percent," the
report said.
</P>
<P>
"This increasing dependence on foreign financing will continue
until the government fully implements major reforms in tax
rationalization and administration and in public expenditure
management," it added.
</P>
<P>
According to the Nepali Finance Ministry, the country's net
outstanding debt stood at 149.2192 billion rupees (2.49 billion
U.S. dollars) by mid-April, 1998, or some 115 dollars per head of
the population.
</P>
<P>
"One country has to generate more resources domestically,"
ADB's Resident Representative in Nepal Richard Vokes told a press
conference held here Friday.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Nepal's economy has been characterized over the
last decade by macroeconomic stability with prudent monetary and
fiscal management.
</P>
<P>
However, over the last few years, growth has slowed down to
around 2 percent, while the incidence of poverty has been on the
rise, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Development Outlook 1999 said that in 1998, Nepal
registered 1.9 percent growth rate, the lowest in more than a
decade.
</P>
<P>
The report said that growth in the agriculture sector, which
contributes to 40.2 percent of GDP, was only about a quarter of
that in 1997 mainly because of poor weather.
</P>
<P>
Industrial production stagnated in 1998, largely due to a
continued decline in the growth of manufacturing and a contraction
in the construction and utilities sectors.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing, which accounts for 10 percent of GDP, grew only
about 2.4 percent in 1998. Problems in the carpet and garment
industries that began in 1994 and are related to weak demand in
export markets and child labor issue have continued to weaken the
manufacturing and export base, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that growth in the service sector was slightly higher
in 1998 than in 1997, but was significantly lower than that
achieved during 1991-94. The economic slowdown hit the sector
particularly hard, especially trade, finance, transport and
communication services.
</P>
<P>
The report said government expenditure has outstripped growth
in revenues, partly because revenue collection grew at less than
half the target rate of 22 percent for 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Revenues are less than 10 percent of GDP, which are low
compared with other countries at a similar level of development,"
it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, export growth continued to recover in 1998,
increasing by 11.7 percent, compared with sluggish growth during
1994-96.
</P>
<P>
The report predicted that short-term economic prospects are not
encouraging for Nepal with overall GDP growth at 2 percent in 1999
and 2.7 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
It foresaw an average growth rate of 5.5 percent for South Asia
in 1999.

<HEADLINE> 1.5 Million Chickens to Be Slaughtered in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- About one and half million
chickens will be slaughtered on about 30 farms in a bid to head
off the Newcastle epidemic sweeping the Central Coast in New South
Wales (NSW) state, Australia.
</P>
<P>
NSW Agriculture Minister Richard Amery Friday said all tiers of
government had approved a full eradication of the viral Newcastle
disease in the region.
</P>
<P>
About 350,000 birds had already been destroyed on nine farms,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The entire destocking would take about a week, with the
clean-up and decontamination expected to continue for up to six
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Experts and equipment from across Australia were being used in
the slaughter of the 1.5 million chickens.
</P>
<P>
NSW Agriculture local disease controller Kevin Cooper said the
eradication had moved into top gear in a bid to quickly eradicate
the highly contagious viral disease.
</P>
<P>
More than 350 people, including Volunteer Rescue Association
and Rural Fire Service volunteers, were helping with the
operation, he said.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment our teams are destroying about 110,000 birds a
day but with more than a million birds to go we need more trained
people," Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
The disease also hit the state last year, which triggered
temporary ban on imports of chicken products from the region by
many countries.

Two major banks quoted the shilling at 65.95/66.15 to the

</P>
<P>
Commercial banks posted the shilling at an average of 65.40/50

<P>
Rates on the benchmark 91-day treasury bills have declined to
single- digit figures from a peak of 27 percent last year.
</P>

<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislative body, the
Standing Committee of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC),
will review seven draft laws in its coming meeting slated for
April 26.
</P>
<P>
The draft law on administrative appeals and a draft amendment
to the Highway Law have been discussed in previous meetings and
are expected to be adopted by the meeting, according to today's
meeting involving the chairman and vice-chairpersons of the NPC
Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to better protect the rights and interests of
citizens and regulate the conduct of the government, the latest
revisions to the draft administrative appeals will further extend
the scope of cases the law covers and provide for strengthened
judicial review of administrative appeals.
</P>
<P>
The amendments to the Highway Law were made to pave the way for
the reform of replacing the highway toll with taxes.
</P>
<P>
To be tabled with the legislature for preliminary review are a
number of other draft laws involving enterprises with exclusive
investment, public bidding, garrisoning troops in the Macao
Special Administrative Region and the prevention of juvenile
delinquency.
</P>
<P>
The four-day meeting will also deliberate two bills submitted

<HEADLINE> China Discovers New Gold Reserve in Old Mine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese geologists have
discovered an additional 10 tons of gold reserves in the
Jinchuangyu Gold Mine, an old mine in north China's Hebei Province
using entirely new prospecting and seismic exploration techniques.
</P>
<P>
Cai Xinpin, a researcher with the Institute of Geology attached
to the Chinese Academy of Sciences told Xinhua today that they
used new prospecting techniques which are totally different from
all the current methods.
</P>
<P>
The find is very timely as China has an insufficiency of gold
reserves and the latest find is valued at one billion yuan (120
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The deposit was discovered at a depth of 1,000 meters and under
the original gold-bearing layers in the mine which was thought to
be worked out after 30 years of operation.
</P>
<P>
An official with the State Gold Administration said that the
discovery is of great importance and bodes well for discovering
other large amounts of reserves in similar almost worn out gold
mines throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
China has more than 200 old gold mines like the Jinchangyu mine
which is reckoned to have the most difficult prospecting
conditions although it is cheaper to re-work an old mine than
start a new one.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Ministry of Science and Technology
revealed that the discovery is to be listed as one of the State
Science and Technology Advancement Awards of 1998, a top science
and technology prize.
</P>
<P>
Now the institute has signed a five-year prospecting plan with
the Jinchangyu mine and according to Cai there may even be several
dozen tons of gold reserves.
</P>
<P>
Following on this success the Institute of Geology is preparing
to use the new techniques to find other gold reserves in old mines
in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, east China's Shandong
Province and southwest China's Yunnan Province.

<P>
MACAO, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen
stressed here today that the candidate of the first chief
executive of the future Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR)
will be entirely decided by the members of the Selection Committee
through secret ballot.
</P>
<P>
The candidate will by no means be decided by the Preparatory
Committee for the Macao SAR, or by any other person, noted Qian,
who is also chairman of the Preparatory Committee.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Selection Committee will nominate candidates of
the chief executive at the first plenary meeting of the committee
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The nominees will then brief the Selection Committee members on
their policy platforms and answer questions raised by the
Selection Committee members.
</P>
<P>
Qian emphasized the central government has always adopted an
unequivocal attitude on the selection of the candidate of the
chief executive, which must be done in accordance with the Basic
Law of the Macao SAR, the relevant decision of the National
People's Congress, as well as the selection method drawn up by the
Preparatory Committee.
</P>
<P>
After examined and approved at the plenary meeting of the
Preparatory Committee, the selected candidate of the chief
executive will be reported to the central people's government for
appointment.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Updates with toll number NATO Bombing Kills at Least 10 at Serbian TV Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 23 (Xinhua) -- At least 10 people were killed
when a NATO plane bombed the Radio-TV Serbia (RTS) building in
central Belgrade early Friday, Yugoslav official sources said.
</P>
<P>
However, RTS satellite transmissions of a test picture appeared
on the air only five hours after the devastating raid.
</P>
<P>
The entrance to the building was smashed and some people were
trapped inside. The transmission tower next to the building was
also damaged, with some satellite or microwave dishes lying in the
ruins.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers spent about one and a half hours to remove one
worker from the rubbles, amputating the victim's legs. Another man
walked out of the damaged building himself but fainted a few
meters away from an ambulance.
</P>
<P>
Many cars in the compound were smashed and most windows and
doors of the building were broken.
</P>
<P>
This was the second time that NATO hit a broadcasting facility
in the Yugoslav capital following the attack Wednesday morning on
a business center building in New Belgrade that housed many
television and radio stations.
</P>
<P>
At around 04:00, four big explosions were again heard over the
capital and some street lights went out following the detonations.
</P>
<P>
Anti-aircraft gunfire was heard soon after.
</P>
<P>
The NATO bombing campaign, which entered its 31st day Friday,
also targeted some Belgrade suburbs, Nis, and a railway bridge on
the Sava at Osrtuznica, about 10 kilometers northwest of Belgrade,
the Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The bombardment came after reported progress in talks between
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and Russian envoy Viktor
Chernomyrdin on Thursday on an international presence under the
United Nations in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Africa Meeting on Child Soldiers Ends in Mozambican Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Conference on Use of Children
as Soldiers in Africa ended here Thursday, urging governments and
armed opposition groups in the continent not to use children as
soldiers in conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The four-day conference adopted a 15-point Maputo Declaration
on Use of Children as Soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The declaration says that it is absolutely unacceptable for any
military force or armed group to recruit children under 18 years
of age as soldiers even when the children claim that they are
willing.
</P>
<P>
It also demands that all children serving in the armed forces
should be demilitarized and sent to safe places.
</P>
<P>
Governments of African states are asked to ensure that the
released child soldiers recover physically and psychologically and
are really reintegrated into the society.
</P>
<P>
According to the declaration, those who continue to recruit or
use children as soldiers should be brought to book.
</P>
<P>
The conference was hosted by the Mozambican Ministry of Social
Action Co- ordination, focusing on such issues as the use of
children as soldiers and the reintegration of these children into
society.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that there are at least 300,000 children under
18 years of age involved in armed conflicts around the world.

<HEADLINE> Substitute Member of Selection Committee Decided in  Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Wong Yau See, a Macao businessman,
was made to be a substitute member of the Selection Committee for
the First Government of the Macao Special Administrative Region (
SAR) Friday morning to fill the vacancy of Stanley Au Chong Kit.
</P>
<P>
Stanley Au, who applied to run for the chief executive of the
Macao SAR, quitted his membership in the Selection Committee in
accordance with a specific method on choosing the candidates of
the chief executive.
</P>
<P>
As Wong won the most votes following Selection Committee
members elected from the industrial, commercial and financial
sector, he was able to fill the vacancy.
</P>
<P>
Edmund Ho Hau Wah, who applied to run for the race, also
resigned his Selection Committee membership. However, no one can
replace his position in the Selection Committee, as Ho acts as a
deputy to China's National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
NPC deputies in Macao naturally become Selection Committee
members.
</P>
<P>
In this sense, there are 199 members of the Selection Committee,
who are holding the committee's first plenary meeting to nominate
the candidates of the first chief executive.

<HEADLINE> Open Scoring System to be Used in Boxing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- A controversial open scoring
system will be used Saturday's night in three boxing championship
fights at MCI Center here.
</P>
<P>
The World Boxing Association will post scores from the ringside
judges after each round when Sharmba Mitchell defends his super
lightweight title against Reggie Green.
</P>
<P>
The other two bouts will employ a different type of open
scoring, which has not been used in any form this decade.
</P>
<P>
Scores will be announced after the fourth, eighth and final
runds in the World Boxing Council middleweight fight between
Hassine Cherifi of France and Keith Holmes of Washington.
</P>
<P>
That system will also be used when Washington's Mark Johnson
meets Ratanchai Vorapin for the vacant International Boxing
Federation junior bantamweight championship.
</P>
<P>
Open scoring "will help restore public trust in boxing,"
promoter Bob Arum said. "There's not one good thing that can come
out of open's coring," said promoter Dan Goossen of America
Presents. "We're trying to alleviate incompetency and dishonesty,
and open scoring does neither."
</P>
<P>
Goossen advocates a school for ringside judges and a rating
system that would allow only the best judges to work championships.

<HEADLINE> Border Trade Thrives in Xinjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region
in northwest China has decided to make border trade, now an
important component of local foreign trade, a new growth point.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the import and export volume of Xinjiang's border
trade amounted to 870 million U.S. dollars, accounting for 57
percent of the region's total foreign trade volume.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous regional border trade administrative bureau
reported that Xinjiang's export volume stood at 376 million
dollars last year, up 64 percent from 1997.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang, which borders eight countries, is now the second-
largest border-trade zone in China after Heilongjiang Province in
the northeast.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang now has more than 400 enterprises engaging in border
trade, with an annual business turnover of 800 million dollars,
and growing by about 50 million dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
The region currently has 15 points of entry along its 5,600
kilometers of border, through which it exports mainly food,
textiles, clothing, shoes and chemical products to neighboring
countries, including Russia, Kazakhstan, and Kirghizstan.
</P>
<P>
The booming border trade has also promoted the development of
the local agriculture, food processing, transportation,
communications, and service trade.
</P>
<P>
Since the opening policy was adopted in 1992, Xinjiang has been
building itself into an important export center in northwest China
and has now opened more than 60 counties.
</P>
<P>
Over the past seven years, Xinjiang's border trade totaled 4.44
billion dollars, registering an annual average increase rate of 42
percent, higher than the national average.
</P>
<P>
Thus far, a network of highways, railways, and airlines has
also been established to serve the growing border trade, and
tourism as well.
</P>
<P>
Since 1998, Xinjiang's border-trade structure has changed, with
trade volume with the Commonwealth of Independent States making up
64 percent of the total, among which Kazakhstan has become
Xinjiang's largest trade partner.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that Xinjiang's exports to five central Asian
countries reached 300 million dollars in 1998, an increase of 70
percent over the previous year, and exports to Russia soared to 25
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang Defu, an official responsible for the border
trade administrative bureau, Xinjiang will focus its effort on
expanding the market in central Asia and Russia this year, and on
establishing border trade a new growth point.

<HEADLINE> First Phase Of Land Reform Starts In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
sanctioned the immediate implementation of the first phase of the
second land reform program to resettle about 118,000 families on
one million hectares of land.
</P>
<P>
The inception phase, to be implemented over two years, would be
financed through an integrated approach which would coordinate
funds from the government, donor agencies and other contributors,
Joseph Msika, national chairman of land reform and resettlement
committee, told local reporters here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that adequate funds are available for this phase, a
team of government officials will shortly leave for Washington to
negotiate with the highest placed officials of the World Bank for
the release of 10 million U.S. dollars for technical development,
the daily Herald Friday quoted Msika as saying.
</P>
<P>
Msika said the 118,000 families will be resettled on the 120
uncontested farms currently available for resettlement.
</P>
<P>
The inception phase, which is the initial stage of the second
land reform and resettlement program, would be multifaceted and
inter-sectoral in approach.
</P>
<P>
The program would provide opportunities to test new and
complementary approaches to land reform and resettlement. Access
to post settlement support in the form of finance, extension and
marketing services for the beneficiaries would be emphasized.
</P>
<P>
It is also expected to build upon the real experiences of
zimbabwe's first phase of land reform of 1980 to 1997, which
redistributed about 3.5 million hectares to 71,000 families, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Sudirman Cup Players Protest Tough Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- With less than three weeks to go
for the Sudirman Cup and World Championships, several men's
singles shuttlers have complained about the rigors of a physical
training program organized by the Badminton Association of
Indonesia (PBSI).
</P>
<P>
The 1999 All England finalist Taufik Hidayat said that he
worried the program might affect his speed or cause injury.
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't make any sense to me that PBSI is forcing us to
have the physical training with only two weeks to go. I'm afraid I
will get injured with the harder training," he was quoted by The
Jakarta Post Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
PBSI called up physical trainer Tahir Djide on Monday to
provide extra training to prepare the shuttlers for the Sudirman
Cup and the World Championships, to be held in consecutive weeks
in Copenhagen from May 10 to May 24.
</P>
<P>
Taufik, 19, spoke emotionally of not being able to stand the
training, especially when Tahir ordered him to stretch his injury-
prone back.
</P>
<P>
"I cried because I tend to have back injuries if I force my
training. I can do what he says but I won't be able to play in
both events. Is this what PBSI wants from me? I told doctor
Michael (Triangto) that I couldn't handle this kind of exercise,"
he said, referring to the association's doctor.
</P>
<P>
Taufik, who ranked 12th in the world, will compete in both
events with 1998 Asian Games silver medalist Hendrawan and 1998
Indonesia Open finalist Budi Santoso.
</P>
<P>
Taufik preferred to concentrate only on the World Championships.
</P>
<P>
"With Budi and Hendrawan on the team, I'll focus on the World
Championships. But I'll be ready for the Sudirman Cup," he said.
</P>
<P>
Budi, ranked third in the world, seconded Taufik's protest.
</P>
<P>
"The time is too short to have physical training. We are
worried that we will get injured. The physical training just
started two days ago and I think we can't follow it 100 percent,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He believed the two-week-period should be used instead for
maintenance training.
</P>
<P>
Tahir also expressed surprise at PBSI's decision on timing of
the training, saying it should have been started three months ago.
</P>
<P>
PBSI vice chairman Agus Wirahadikusumah defended his decision.
</P>
<P>
"Tahir is a very experienced physical trainer and I am sure
that he has arranged his program as needed by PBSI and he has also
considered our need and the limited time," he said.
</P>
<P>
Agus said he told the shuttlers not to complain too much with
the hard training, saying he was not fully really satisfied with
their form in recent international tournaments.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has registered Hendrawan, Taufik, Budi and Hariyanto
Arbi in the men's singles, and Mia Audina, Cindana, Ellen Angelina
and Lidya Djaelawidjaja in the women's singles for both events.
</P>
<P>
The men's doubles teams of Candra Wijaya and Tony Gunawan,
Ricky Subagja and Rexy Mainaky, Antonius and Denny Kantono and
Flandy Limpele and Eng Hian will also join the squad.
</P>
<P>
Women's duos of Elysa and Deyana Lomban, Indarti Issoliana and
Carmelita and Cynthia Tuwankotta and Etty Tantri and mixed pairs
of Tri Kusherjanto and Minarti Timur, Bambang Suprianto and Zelin
Resiana and Wahyu Agung and Emma Ermawati are also included.
</P>
<P>
PBSI is to stage a competiton simulation at the Armed Forces
headquarters in East Jakarta on Friday and at the Indonesian
Badminton Center, also in East Jakarta, on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Top Seed Stoltenberg Beaten in Clay Court Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Jason Stoltenberg of
Australia was beaten by Argentine Herman Gumy in the second round
of the Clay Court Championships in Florida, the United States on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Stoltenberg saved six break points but could not stop Gumy from
reaching his first ATP Tour quarter-final since August of 1997
with a 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (7-4) win in two hours and 28 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Stoltenberg fought off triple match point in the second set to
force a second tiebreaker, but could not turn the tide in his
favour.
</P>
<P>
The Australian's ouster left defending champion Jim Courier as
the highest remaining seed as the fifth-seeded Courier beat
Spaniard Galo Blanco 7-5, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
With most of the world's top players competing in Monte Carlo
this week, Courier has an excellent chance of picking up his 24th
career title.
</P>
<P>
In other games, seventh seed Christian Ruud of Norway rallied
past Argentina's Lucas Arnold 3-6, 7-6, 6-2 and will face Gumy in
the quarters.
</P>
<P>
Courier next faces qualifier Max Mirnyi of Belarus, who posted
a 6-2, 7-6 (9-7) win over French qualifier Rodolphe Cadart who
eliminated Petr Korda in the first round.

<HEADLINE> Scholars Call for Rebuilding Int'l Financial Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 23 (Xinhua) -- A group of Chinese scholars
recently called for rebuilding in the world's financial order
which has suffered from an increasingly severe crisis centered on
mushrooming malpractices.
</P>
<P>
The scholars said developing countries have the right to
supervise the international financial sector and noted that the
industry should be opened on a step-by-step basis.
</P>
<P>
They expressed their views at a seminar held recently in
Shanghai, China's financial center.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese scholars analyzed the ups and downs in the
development of the international financial sector in a bid to find
an approach for resolving the existing situation.
</P>
<P>
Financial liberalization and commercialization since the 1980s
have helped improve the capital structure and the efficiency of
the international financial market.
</P>
<P>
However, the absence of international mechanisms for ensuring
financial safety and risk management, as well as the weakness of
the international financial legal system, have sparked rampant
speculation and bulging economic bubbles around the world. The
situation has harmed economic development, financial order and the
living standards of people in many countries.
</P>
<P>
The experts proposed strict controls on the flow of short-term
international capital, while attaching special importance to
preventing global transfers of capitals with a term of one year or
less.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) should be
reformed to become a true "action center" for safeguarding the
international financial order. They also called for improving the
monitoring and warning system for financial crises and reinforcing
the capacity for financial recovery of crisis-stricken economies.
</P>
<P>
The experts stressed the financial sovereignty of all countries,
noting that developing countries should be respected for their
efforts to liberalize the financial sector gradually. They also
called on the international community to support the restrictive
measures taken by sovereign countries against international
capital in order to protect the safety and stability of their
financial industry.
</P>
<P>
China should accelerate the pace for restructuring its
financial industry and play its due role in the reconstruction of
the international financial system, according to the scholars.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Slams Japan's Foreign Policy Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, April 23 (Xinhua) -- A leading newspaper in the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) on Friday accused
Japan of trying to establish its military domination in Asia,
saying it is becoming "a dangerous aggressive force in Asia."
</P>
<P>
In a commentary, Rodong Sinmun said Japan's militarist ambition
was exposed in its 1999 Diplomatic Blue Book, in which the
Japanese authorities emphasized the necessity to "cope with varied
threats" on the pretext of DPRK's "launching of missiles."
</P>
<P>
The paper charged that Japan is stepping up arms expansion and
strengthening its military strength in a bid to realize its "
aggressive ambition."
</P>
<P>
It also criticized Japan's plan to play a leading role in the
establishment of a new international order as revealed in the
annual report.
</P>
<P>
"Japan's pursuit of hegemonism and its attempt to establish a
new world order with Japan playing a leading role fully exposed
its ambition to establish its military domination in Asia and the
rest of the world," the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
Japan is making the situation in East Asia increasingly tense
and enhancing the threat of war in the region, the paper said.

QUITO -- Ecuador has decided to cancel the high tariffs for
products from the Andean Community of Nations ( CAN) members
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to a government resolution, the Foreign Commerce and
Investments Council (COMEXT) will cancel tariffs of two to 10
percent for imports from the CAN members.
</P>
<P>
This would represent a decrease of Ecuador's income by some 50
million dollars per year, but it can go ahead with the debit of
one fourth of the 400 million dollars it granted the Latin

BRASILIA -- The World Bank (WB) on Thursday predicted a fall to
1.5 percent in the average growth rate of developing countries in
1999.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 Asian crisis, which crippled the economic growth in
developing countries and cut by half the flows of international
capital set aside for them, was the main reason for the fall, said
the WB in its report of "Global Development Finance" published
here.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, which forecast a bleak period from
now on to year 2001, the growth rate of world production will
further fall this year compared with a 1.8 percent growth in 1998.
Several Latin American economies, the former Soviet Union, the
Middle East and the petroleum exporting countries will suffer a
stagnation or even a fall in production. (WB-Developing Country-
Economy)

BRASILIA -- Brazilian Finance Minister Pedro Malan said
Thursday that his country's economy is recovering more quickly
than expected.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an international seminar on global financial
situation, Malan said that the economic transition would not be so
drastic and sluggish as those pessimists had foretold, though
there were still a lot of obstacles ahead.
</P>
<P>
He said that domestic and international studies have indicated
that the possibility of an inflation explosion in 1999 has
diminished and an economic recession, investment atrophy and
unemployment increase might not be coming about.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will be made to prevent the recurrence of a soaring
inflation rate which had been shadowing Brazil's economy from the
1970s to the early 1990s, the minister said. (Brazil-Economy)

<HEADLINE> Malaria Epidemic Looms in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaria epidemic is looming in many
parts of Vietnam with the health authorities calling for urgent
measures to curb its spread.
</P>
<P>
Already, 29 people died in the first two months of this year in
both coastal and highland provinces in central Vietnam with over
39,000 people reported to have been infected by the mosquito-borne
disease nation-wide, according to a report of Vietnam News Friday.
</P>
<P>
What has made Vietnam's health authorities particularly worried
is evidence over the past year that malaria was resurfacing as a
major health threat, said the Vietnam's English daily.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is really complicated, though the epidemic
hasn't occurred yet," Vietnam News quoted Tran Quoc Tuy from
Vietnam's Institute of Malariology, Entomology and parasitology as
saying.
</P>
<P>
After several years of decline the first signs of a resurgence
began to occur in 1997, said Tuy.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the situation deteriorated with the number of
infectious cases 20 percent higher than in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Major malarial outbreaks often occur during the rainy season
which generally runs from April to October in most parts of
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's National Malaria Prevention Project has developed a
plan of action to prevent the epidemic this year that has the
ambitious aim of reducing the number of reported infectious cases
by 10 percent and deaths by 5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Parliament Approves Clean Governance Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- All four factions at the
Indonesia's House of Representatives (DPR) has endorsed a bill on
clean governance at a plenary meeting here.
</P>
<P>
The draft law, endorsed on Thursday, is expected to be formally
enacted into law by President B.J. Habibie, according to national
newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The new bill will cover the supervision of all state officials
including the president, ministers, senior government officials
and managers of state-owned enterprises. The bill will oblige all
government officials to declare their assets when they begin and
end their tenures with the state.
</P>
<P>
"Their positions are very prone to corruption, collusion and
nepotism (known by the Indonesian acronym KKN). This law will
eradicate all KKN practices," ruling Golkar spokesman Sofyan Lubis
said in the plenary House session to adopt the bill.
</P>
<P>
"With the adoption of this bill, all state officials holding
strategic positions, including the president, must abide by its
ruling," an Indonesian Democratic Party faction representative
said.
</P>
<P>
The new bill also mandates the president, as the head of state,
to head a Permanent Commission of Examiners to oversee state
officials at executive, legislative and judicatory positions, and
officials assigned to state companies.
</P>
<P>
The commission has the power to audit state officials holding
office, as long as it is for clarification and not investigation
purposes.
</P>
<P>
The court can impose a minimum punishment of a two-year jail
and a 200-million-rupiah (230,000 U.S. dollars) fine for violators
of the law.
</P>
<P>
Under the current system, newly installed officials are
required to declare all assets to their superiors, while senior
officials, including cabinet members, must report their wealth
directly to the president. However, they have no obligations to
report their wealth after completing their state duties.
</P>
<P>
In addition to their approval, legislators strongly urged the
government to seriously launch an investigation into the wealth of
former president Soeharto and his cronies.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was forced to step down on May 21 last year amid the
country's worst political and economic crisis in decades. He is
accused of corruption and abuse of power during his 32 years in
power.
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Muladi told the House that the government will
soon issue four government regulations and one presidential decree
to accelerate the implementation of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the enactment of the law is a preventive measure
aimed at the avoidance of corruption among state administrators.
</P>
<P>
The minister has expressed hopes the House will also pass a
bill to amend the anti-corruption law, to be effective in coping
with increasingly sophisticated corrupt practices.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the House is still deliberating an
anti-corruption bill to amend the No. 3/1973 law.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Irian Jaya to Split Into Three Provinces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
 has instructed Home Affairs Minister Syarwan Hamid to draft bill
that would split the remote territory of Irian Jaya into three
provinces before the June 7 general election.
</P>
<P>
The planned division, which aims to improve the welfare of the
Irianese, was discussed at a limited cabinet meeting on politics
and security affairs Thursday, The Indonesian Observer reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The bill will soon be drafted by the Home Affairs Ministry,
said Wayan Karya, an official from the Coordinating Ministry for
Politics and Security Affairs.
</P>
<P>
"We expect that before the June election, Irian Jaya will
become three provinces, namely West Irian, Central Irian and East
Irian," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the main objective of the government's plan is to
facilitate the development of Irian Jaya.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives on Wednesday passed a draft law on
regional governance, which suggests that Irian Jaya become three
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Irian Jaya covers 421,981 square kilometers, which makes it
about 3.5 times bigger than Java island.
</P>
<P>
At last count in 1990, the province had a population of 1.65
million, most of whom are Melanesians, like people in the
neighboring nation of Papua New Guinea.
</P>
<P>
Irian Jaya has huge reserves of gold and copper, which
U.S.-based mining giant PT Freeport Indonesia has been exploiting
since the 1960s.

<HEADLINE> China, U.S. Continue WTO Talks (Details Added) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and U.S. negotiators are
at their second-day talks on remaining issues of China's entry to
the World Trade Organization (WTO), following Thursday's group
discussions that ended with no obvious results.
</P>
<P>
The talks began here at 9:45 this morning, and the two sides
are scheduled to hold two technical group discussions, one on
service trade and the other on the trade of textiles.
</P>
<P>
It is yet to be clear when the negotiation on details of
China's WTO entry protocol, which lasted for nearly two hours
Thursday afternoon, will resume.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen members of the U.S. delegation attended this morning's
group discussions, with the majority of them participating in
discussions for the service trade negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua learned that members of the U.S. negotiators include
officials from the U.S. embassy in Beijing and the U.S. Department
of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
Neither Long Yongtu, chief negotiator of the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), nor Assistant U.S.
Trade Representative Robert Cassidy were present at today's group
talks.
</P>
<P>
This round of negotiations began Thursday morning. Long and
Cassidy conducted 30-minute small group and closed door talks in
the morning. They reached an agreement on the procedure and
contents of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The two sides conducted a three-hour closed door group
discussion in the afternoon, both Chinese and U.S. negotiators
declined to make comment on questions raised by reporters.
</P>
<P>
Topics scheduled for discussion in the current round of talks
include the legal terms for China's entry into the WTO, tariffs on
manufactured goods and the opening of China's service sector wider,
mainly within finance, insurance and telecommunications sectors,
according to a MOFTEC official.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Sun Yuxi said Thursday afternoon at
a regular press conference that China has hoped to resolve the
remaining issues and reach agreements with the United States on
China's entry into the WTO as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The current round of talks is to implement what Premier Zhu
Rongji and U.S. President Bill Clinton agreed earlier on China's
entry into WTO. They have decided to intensify negotiations for
resolving remaining issues in talks on China's accession to the
multi-lateral trade body by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government voiced firm support for China's entry into
the WTO in 1999 during Zhu's visit to the United States earlier
this month, and great progress has been made for Sino-U.S.
negotiations on China's 13-year bid to join the WTO.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Funds Help Shaanxi Improve Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Shaanxi Province
has used 156 million US dollars in foreign loans and 14 million US
dollars in foreign donations over the past few years for a number
of environmental protection projects.
</P>
<P>
Comprehensive pollution control projects in Xi'an, Xianyang and
Tongchuan focus on upgrading local power generation and heating
facilities, as well as dust control at cement plants. The projects,
funded by the Asian Development Bank, are scheduled for completion
in mid-May.
</P>
<P>
A U.S.-based bank has granted loans totaling 900,000 US dollars
for the development of automatic air quality supervision systems
in Xi'an and Weinan.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations and Japan have also provided funds for air
pollution control research.
</P>
<P>
Foreign loans and donations helped overcome insufficient
funding for the environmental protection effort, according to a
local official.
</P>
<P>
The province has suffered from heavy air pollution created by
the local topography and landforms such as loess plateaus, as well
as an irrational industrial structure and the use of coal as a
major source of energy. Xi'an was listed as one of the world's 10
most polluted cities in the early 1990s.

<HEADLINE> Traffic Accidents Increase in Phnom Penh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, April 23 (Xinhua) -- At least 100 people were
killed in traffic accidents in Phnom Penh in 1998, up from 88 in
1997, and 435 were seriously injured, a 65 percent jump from 263
in 1997, the Cambodian Daily reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, municipal traffic police recorded 540 traffic
accidents compared with 429 cases in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Drunken and fast driving is the main problem, according to a
traffic official. In addition, the increasing number of cars and
motorbikes in the capital causes traffic jam, and there are many
new drivers who do not know the traffic rules well.
</P>
<P>
Municipal police are planning to launch a campaign on June 1 to
combat an increasing number of traffic accidents in Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a public education campaign and a crackdown on
unlicensed cars and vehicles without lights will be carried out in
efforts to improve traffic safety.

<HEADLINE> Penguins to Be Attraction in Tropical Sri Lankan Zoo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Penguins are to be the latest
attraction at the tropical Sri Lanka's National Zoological Gardens
at Dehiwala, south suburb of the capital Colombo.
</P>
<P>
According to Zoo Director Senarath Gunasena, nine penguins, a
gift from the UENO Zoo in Tokyo, will be imported within the next
few months.
</P>
<P>
Enclosures for the birds, now under construction, will cost 4
million rupees (58,000 U.S. dollars) as air conditioning and other
temperature control facilities have to be introduced.
</P>
<P>
The director said penguins had been a major attraction once,
but as facilities were not available, the zoo did not have
penguins for the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The National Zoological Gardens, famous for elephant
performance, received about 1.2 million local and foreign tourists
in 1998, with revenues of 800,000 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> China Coastal City to Use Cloud-Seeding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- This southern boomtown in
Guangdong Province will seed the clouds between April 25 and May
15 to alleviate the drought which has affected the city since last
autumn.
</P>
<P>
Located on the southern coast of China, Shenzhen has favorable
conditions for producing man-made rain by cloud-seeding, as 6
billion tons of water vapor drift inland from the South China Sea
through Shenzhen every year, according to Wu Dui, a meteorologist
at the Guangzhou Tropical Marine Meteorological Institute.
</P>
<P>
He said there are usually large clusters of cumulus clouds in
the sky over the city from April to October, and that if this
method is used, Shenzhen can expect 30 percent more precipitation
than it would get from only natural rain.
</P>
<P>
The monthly cost of the cloud-seeding is expected to be around
one million yuan, said Wu.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen has invited a team of specialists from the
meteorological institute from the northeast China province of
Jilin to conduct this operation because it is equipped with
advanced cloud-seeding airplanes imported from the United States.
</P>
<P>
The city has suffered so severe a drought that three of its
reservoirs nearly dry up, greatly afflicting local agricultural
production.

<HEADLINE> NATO Bombs Yugoslav TV Building, With Casualties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 23 (Xinhua) -- A NATO plane bombed the Radio-TV
Serbia (RTS) building in central Belgrade early Friday.
</P>
<P>
The entrance to the building was smashed and some people were
trapped inside. The transmission tower next to the building was
also damaged, with some satellite or microwave dishes lying in the
ruins.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers spent about one and a half hours to remove one
worker from the rubbles, amputating the victims' legs.
</P>
<P>
Another man walked out of the damaged building himself but
fainted a few meters from an ambulance.
</P>
<P>
Many cars in the compound were smashed and most windows and
doors of the building were broken.
</P>
<P>
RTS programs were off the air at 02:07 local time.
</P>
<P>
This was the second time that NATO hit a broadcasting facility
in the Yugoslav capital following the attack Wednesday morning on
a business center building in New Belgrade that housed many
television and radio stations.
</P>
<P>
At around 04:00, four big explosions were again heard over the
capital and some street lights went out following the detonations.
</P>
<P>
Anti-aircraft gunfire was heard soon after.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the residence of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic was hit in NATO air raids at 4 a.m. (0200 GMT) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the attack, Milosevic and his family were
reportedly not in the house, which was completely destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The NATO bombing campaign, which entered its 30th day Friday,
also targeted some Belgrade suburbs, Nis, and a railway bridge on
the Sava at Osrtuznica, about 10 kilometers northwest of Belgrade,
the Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The bombardment came after reported progress in talks between
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and Russian envoy Viktor
Chernomyrdin on Thursday on an international presence under the
United Nations in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In a dispatch from Belgrade, the Russian Itar-Tass news agency
quoted Chernomyrdin as saying that his talks with Milosevic in the
Yugoslav capital yielded a joint document on such a presence.
</P>
<P>
"What kind of international presence they will be or from which
countries -- this is yet to be discussed, but the main thing is
that Russia will take part in them," Tass quoted Chernomyrdin as
saying at the airport before leaving for Moscow.

<HEADLINE> Y2K No Threat to Pacemakers: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Year-2000 computer problem
will not affect the normal functions of pacemakers and
defibrillators implanted in patients, according to one Chinese
expert.
</P>
<P>
The problem, also known as Y2K or the millennium bug, stems
from the fact that early computer programmers used only the last
two digits of the four-digit year number in order to save computer
memory. Because of this, it is anticipated that computers may read
the year 2000 as 1900,a potential disaster of worldwide
proportions.
</P>
<P>
Professor Li Xueqi of the No.2 Hospital attached to Harbin
Medical University in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province,
said today that pacemakers and defibrillators will function
normally on December 31, 1999 and will continue to operate
normally after that date.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the control circuits of these devices are
based on internal calculations, and doctors control the apparatus,
so when they treat their patients, the pacemakers and
defibrillators are not affected by any specific date or time.
</P>
<P>
The professor admitted that some older pacemakers might have a
Y2K problem, but this can be easily solved by installing new
controls.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that pacemaker manufacturers inspect their
products to avoid any potential risk to patients.

<HEADLINE> 1999 Growth Rate to Fall to 1.5% in Developing Countries: WB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, April 22 (Xinhua)-- The World Bank (WB) on Thursday
predicted a fall to 1.5 percent in the average growth rate of
developing countries in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 Asian crisis, which crippled the economic growth in
developing countries and cut by half the flows of international
capital set aside for them, was the main reason for the fall, said
the WB in its report of "Global Development Finance" published
here.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, which forecast a bleak period from now
on to year 2001, the growth rate of world production will further
fall this year compared with a 1.8 percent growth in 1998. Several
Latin American economies, the former Soviet Union, the Middle East
and the petroleum exporting countries will suffer a stagnation or
even a fall in production.
</P>
<P>
"This forecast reflects a slow-down in the growth of
international commerce, a fall in the prices of raw materials and
the most difficult financial conditions in the years to come",
said Joseph Stiglitz, vice president of the WB.

WASHINGTON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Attorney General of the
United States Eric Holder said here Thursday that the school
shooting Tuesday in a Colorado high school would spur passage of "
reasonable restrictions on the possession of guns".
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department will raise a package including tighter
gun control measures to the Congress within weeks, Holder told a
weekly press briefing.
</P>
<P>
"We want to... ensure that young people who have been convicted
of serious crimes don't have access to guns, in the way that we
now, under the Brady law, prevent adults who convicted of serious
crimes from ever possessing guns," he said.
</P>
<P>
Two 18-year-old gunmen killed 12 students and one teacher
before taking their own lives at Columbine High School in Colorado
Tuesday. The campus tragedy shocked the whole nation.
</P>
<P>
However, it is difficult to get the proposals approved by the
congress as anti-gun laws are strongly opposed by the powerful
National Rifle Association.

<HEADLINE> Philippoussis Advances in Monte Carlo Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Mark Philippoussis scored a 4-6, 7-
6 (7-5), 6-2 victory over Sebastien Grosjean on Thursday as the
weather changed after a string of hard-court specialists failed at
the Monte Carlo Open.
</P>
<P>
Marcelo Rios, Gustavo Kuerten, Carlos Moya and Albert Costa
were among other seeded players to advance, after hard-court
specialists Yevgeny Kafelnikov, Thomas Enqvist and Greg Rusedski
all were defeated in the wet conditions on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The change in the weather helped Philippoussis' style as the No.
5 Australian set up a quarterfinal clash against Rios.
</P>
<P>
Rios moved a step closer to repeating his 1997 triumph here
with a 6-3, 6-3, win against Morocco's Hicham Arazi who has ousted
No. 11 seed Goran Ivanisevic and Argentine clay-court specialist
Mariano Puerta from the dlrs 2.2 million event.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's Gustavo Kuerten beat compatriot Fernando Meligeni in
straight sets in another third-round match. The former French
Open winner, seeded No. 13 here, won 6-2, 7-6 (7-2) in one hour,
15 minutes, and has now won all four meetings against Meligeni.
</P>
<P>
No. 1 seed Carlos Moya beat Morocco's Karim Alami 6-4, 6-1, and
will face Jerome Golmard, a 6-1, 6-4, winner over Arnaud Di
Pasquale in a contest between two unseeded French players.
</P>
<P>
Spain's Albert Costa, the No. 10 seed, also made it to the last
eight with a 4-6, 6-2, 6-4, victory against Jiri Novak of the
Czech Republic, and will play countryman 15th-seeded Felix
Mantilla after the latter breezed to a 6-2, 6-2 win against Ivan
Ljubicic, the 198th-ranked player who thrashed Kafelnikov in the
last round.

<HEADLINE> China Orient Plans Two Satellite Launches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- China Orient Telecomm Satellite
Co. Ltd, whose ChinaStar-1 went into operation last July, has its
sights fixed firmly on the heavens.
</P>
<P>
The company is considering initiating two more satellite
projects "at an appropriate time," a senior company executive
revealed on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
China Orient, whose establishment was approved by the State
Council in a bid to boost the country's satellite communications
capability, celebrated its forth anniversary yesterday.
</P>
<P>
"As the telecommunications market keeps expanding and the
economy in the countries hit by the Asian crisis begins to pick up,
the demand for satellite services is expected to surge," Hao
Weimin, president of China Orient, was quoted by today's China
Daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
The company owns ChinaStar-1, which has 24 C-band and 24 Ku-
band transponders. It has leased more than half of its capacity
since the satellite was placed in orbit on May 30, 1998, Hao said.
</P>
<P>
The telecommunications satellite was made by the US Lockheed
Martin Corp.
</P>
<P>
Hao declined to give a timetable for the launch of the new
satellites, or say whether they would be manufactured by a US,
European or Chinese company.
</P>
<P>
"We will focus on the performance and price of the satellites,"
Hao said.
</P>
<P>
China now has three companies that own and manage satellites:
China Orient, Sino Satellite Communications Co. Ltd, and China
Telecommunications Broadcast Satellite Corp, according to Hao.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Needs More Electric Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has been running short of
electricity in the past two years as hydro power plants in the
country have not been operating at their full capacity due to
water shortage at dams and reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the installed capacity of
state-run Myanmar Electric Power Enterprise (MEPE), the main
electricity supplier in the country, was only 1,248 megawatts (mw)
as of the end of 1998, while the units generated by the enterprise
in 1998 were merely 4.309 billion kilowatt-hours (kwh), 487
million kwh less than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
In efforts to resolve the power shortage problem, Myanmar
reached some agreements with two Chinese companies last year to
implement three hydropower projects in Mandalay, Magway and
Sagaing divisions.
</P>
<P>
The authorities have been asking local subscribers to reduce
their power consumption as much as they can, especially in the
capital of Yangon that covers the areas of foreign embassies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Myanmar is planning to purchase power from
neighboring Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Brazil's Economy Gets Quicker Recovery: Finance Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, April 22 (Xinhua)-- Brazilian Finance Minister Pedro
Malan said Thursday that his country's economy is recovering more
quickly than expected.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an international seminar on global financial
situation, Malan said that the economic transition would not be so
drastic and sluggish as those pessimists had foretold, though
there were still a lot of obstacles ahead.
</P>
<P>
He said that domestic and international studies have indicated
that the possibility of an inflation explosion in 1999 has
diminished and an economic recession, investment atrophy and
unemployment increase might not be coming about.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will be made to prevent the recurrence of a soaring
inflation rate which had been shadowing Brazil's economy from the
1970s to the early 1990s, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent report by the Washington-based
International Monetary Fund, the impact of the devaluation of the
Brazil's currency, the real, has been relatively alleviated and
investor confidence has returned, making it possible for Brazil to
reduce its interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The report forecast a growth rate of 3.7 percent for Brazil
next year, compared to a 3.8 percent drop in output in 1999.

<HEADLINE> PAL Given Deadline to Cut Workforce or Face Closure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Airlines (PAL) has
given until June 4 to raise 200 million U.S. dollars in fresh
capital and lay off workforce to avoid closure, the Philippine
Star said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that PAL majority shareholder Lucio Tan has
pledged to put up the 100 million dollars, but is still looking
for the additional 100 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Quoting Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman
Perfecto Yasay, the paper said that PAL's large workforce was one
of the main reasons the airline was unattractive to new investors.
</P>
<P>
To stabilize its financial situation, PAL reduced its fleet
from 54 planes to 22 and its workforce from 13,000 to 8,000.
</P>
<P>
Yasay said that it is unlikely that PAL could operate viably
with only 22 aircraft and 8,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
"Under those conditions, we will have no option at the SEC but
to close Philippine Airlines and every body goes," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have to resolve this long before June 4. Otherwise we'll be
left with on option but to order the liquidation of PAL," he said.
</P>
<P>
But in an earlier interview, Yasay said that the airline has to
reduce further its workforce to only about 3,000.
</P>
<P>
PAL has been unable to repay its 2.2 billion dollars of debt
mainly because of an ill-timed expansion plan, compounded by labor
unrest and the Asian financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Lazio Beat Lokomotiv for European Cup Winners' Cup Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 22 (Xinhua) -- With neither sides scoring a single
goal, Lazio walked over Lokomotiv Moscow on the away goals rule to
enter for their first and last European Cup Winners' Cup final on
Thursday as the tournament is set to be abolished next season.
</P>
<P>
Lazio, who came from behind to draw the first leg in Moscow 1-1,
were outplayed by the spirited Russian side inspired by striker
Zaza Dzanashia, and had their only chance in the 30th minute when
Yugoslav defender Sinisa Mihajlovic hit the crossbar with his
freekick.
</P>
<P>
However, coach Sven Goran Eriksson was still full of confidence
in the final in Birmingham on May 19 against Mallorca who advanced
2-1 on aggregate over holders Chelsia for their first-even
appearance in its 83-year history.
</P>
<P>
For Lazio, it is only their second in a major European final
after last year's UEFA Cup final which they lost 3-0 to fellow
Italians Inter Milan.
</P>
<P>
"Reaching a European final for the second year in a row is
important to us. Let's hope we get a better result than we did
against Inter last year," said coach Eriksson.
</P>
<P>
Croat Alen Boksic, goalscorer from the first leg, and Chilean
striker Marcelo Salas were put on the bench in order not to risk
second bookings which would have ruled them out of the final.
</P>
<P>
Thus, Roberto Mancini partnered Christian Vieri along the front
as Lazio started slowly, and Lokomotiv controlled most of the
match with Dmitry Bulykin fired in a dangerous low shot across the
bar in the seventh minute.
</P>
<P>
Eriksson threw on Argentine midfielder Mathias Almeyda for
injured Couto, and Vieri kept pressures in a string of counter
attacks, preventing the Lokomotive from scoring in all their away
games in this year's tournament.

<HEADLINE> WNBA Labor Agreement Fallen Apart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The labor agreement between
the WNBA and its players has collaped and the league has to
postpone Tuesday's draft indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
The league said the WNBA Players Association had made new
economic demands after the tentative agreement was reached last
week.
</P>
<P>
The union, meanwhile, said the league had added last-minute
terms and conditions in talks late Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The two sides reached an agreement in principle on April 14 on
a new four-year contract and had hoped to have it in final written
form by Thursday.
</P>
<P>
WNBA president Val Ackerman said Thursday the union is trying
to renegotiate the rookie minumum salary, player bonuses and the
rookie scale and reduce the number of appearances players make in
their communities.
</P>
<P>
A union spokesperson said the league introduced five issues in
talks Wednesday night and said that if the players' association
did not agree to them, there would be no deal.
</P>
<P>
The deal reached before included increases in the minumium
salary from $15,000 to $30,000 for veterans and $25,000 for
rookies. Those figures would rise to $40,000 and $30,000,
respectively, by 2002.
</P>
<P>
Among the changes was the right to extend the 32-game season
without increasing salaries, the addition of random drug testing
and no increase in the rookie wage scale for the duration of the
contract.
</P>
<P>
No agreement had been reached on any of those issues in the
original bargaining, the spokesperson said.
</P>
<P>
No further talks between the union and league were scheduled.

<P>
This is the second attempt at a professional track and field

compete in the United States, an opportunity to be on television
and a chance to make money."
</P>
<P>
The June 6 meet, the only one scheduled for this year, will be
comprised of 15 events. For men, there will be the 100 meters, 200
meters, 3,000 meters, 110m hurdles, high jump, pole vault and shot
put. For women, the events will be the 100, 800, mile, 100m
hurdles, high jump, pole vault and triple jump.
</P>
<P>
The meet, with a finals-only format of eight competitors in
each event, will be televised live by ESPN.
</P>
<P>
Prize money will be awarded and the program will be expanded
next year from April-June. The athletes will be mostly Americans,
with some foreigners added.
</P>
<P>
The league follows the introduction of USATF's Golden Spike
Tour indoor circuit this year, consisting of four nationally
televised meets.

<HEADLINE> Lukashenko: Russia-Belarus Union Not to Be Involved in Balkan Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Belarussian President Alexander
Lukashenko stressed Thursday that Yugoslavia's application for
joining the Russia-Belarus Union will not lead to the involvement
of Belarussia and Russia in the present Balkan conflict.
</P>
<P>
War is not the reason for Yugoslavia to apply for the entry
into the union, because the country had raised its application
long ago, Lukashenko told Interfax in Osipovichi, a city in mid-
Belarus.
</P>
<P>
Belarus and Russia have so far insisted Yugoslavia first become
an observer of the union parliament.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko admitted it may take some time for Yugoslavia to
enter the union, but a definite answer from Belarus and Russia
will be announced after the end of the current war.
</P>
<P>
He got the impression from his meeting with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic that Yugoslavia does not want Belarus and
Russia to get involved in the conflict, Lukashenko added.

<P>
SANTIAGO DE BOGOTA, April 22 (Xinhua)-- Guerrillas from the
National Liberation Army (ELN) of Colombia Thursday fired at a
plane of the anti-narcotic police, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the aircraft was attacked near Honda, less
than 200 kilometers west of Bogota, where it flew in to help bank
guards who reported 190,000 U.S. dollars robbed by the rebels from
their coach.
</P>
<P>
The plane received five shots and had to fly away, but it
didn't suffer major damages, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas fled with the plunder.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a new round of negotiations between the government
and the largest rebel group, the 15,000-member Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, has entered the third day amid rising public
skepticism.
</P>
<P>
Colombia's long civil war claimed at least 35,000 lives in the

<HEADLINE> Ancient Mummified Body Discovered in Xinjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Archeologists from the Xinjiang
Archeological Institute were astonished to find an ancient
mummified body of a man when they opened a coffin in a 1900-year-
old graveyard they had unearthed three years.
</P>
<P>
The box-shaped coffin with colorful paintings on the outside
was discovered together with over 150 ancient tombs dating back to
the Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220 A.D.) at Yingpan near Lop Nur in
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
This coffin along with five others had been shipped to Urumqi,
the regional capital, and were kept in the institute, unopened,
awaiting further research and study.
</P>
<P>
The archeologists estimate that the mummified man, believed to
have lived during the Eastern Han Dynasty, was 180 centimeters
high and might have died at about 25 years of age.
</P>
<P>
With thick brown hairs, the mummy's face and body was shrunken,
and the skin had turned gray and brown, but the beard and eyebrows
and eyelashes are clearly discernible. The mummy's clothes are
intact and retain their bright color.
</P>
<P>
The mummy has been dubbed "the handsome Yingpan man" and is
thought to be comparable to the "beautiful Loulan woman," a 3,800-
year-old female mummy discovered in 1980 at the Tiebanhe Delta,
about 200 kilometers east of Yingpan.
</P>
<P>
Loulan was an ancient kingdom along China's Silk Road in
Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
The female mummy is believed to be the most intact and oldest
ever found in China.
</P>
<P>
The archeologists claim the newly discovered mummy may have
been a rich man from a Western country, judging from his robe's
decorative pattern and the carpet covering the coffin, both in the
Greek style.
</P>
<P>
They say, Xinjiang's hot and dry climate has kept the mummy
intact.
</P>
<P>
The tomb was on a 5-meter-high platform which kept it from
being submerged by water.
</P>
<P>
The mummy is believed to be significant for the study of
economic and cultural exchanges between China and Western
countries in ancient times.

<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- China will speed up development
of a series of long-distance education networks to ensure its
citizens receive learning opportunities throughout their lives,
said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Computerized long-distance teaching networks will be available
by 2010 for post-graduate education, vocational programs,
teacher's training and specialized instruction for urban and rural
laborers across China.
</P>
<P>
The State will intensify efforts, through television and
computer-based teaching systems, to spread basic education program
throughout poor, remote, island, mountains and pastoral areas.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education will co-ordinate establishment of
more long-distance education networks. They will link into China
Education and Research Computer Network (Cernet), according to
Wang Zhuzhu from the Ministry's Long-Distance Education Office.
</P>
<P>
Most colleges and universities and middle and vocational
schools will link into Cernet within three years, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
China's long-distance education program was developed in the
early 1950s and has been upgraded periodically since China
implemented its reform and opening-up policies in late 1978.

<HEADLINE> Blatter Calls for Halt to Exodus of African Football Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- African countries have been advised
to stem the exodus of good football players in order for their
professional league to develop soccer on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference held here Thursday, Sepp Blatter,
president of the International Football Federation (FIFA), said
that "you must avoid exodus of good players, otherwise you will
never have professional league in your countries."
</P>
<P>
The FIFA chief, who is in Nigeria for the on-going 10th World
Youth Championship urged African countries to develop their
economy so as to sustain professional soccer.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Africa must allow football development to grow
alongside economic development, adding "your football and economy
must move along the same direction."
</P>
<P>
Blatter pointed out that Africa could boast of top footballers
playing in European countries, while back home there was no
development.
</P>
<P>
The FIFA president expressed joy with the fact that the semi-
sinals are representatives of four continents, that is, Spain from
Europe, Uruguary from South America, Mali from Africa and
surprisingly Japan from Asia.
</P>
<P>
That is a welcome development for the championship, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
On Nigeria's bid for the 2006 World Cup, Blatter said he had
not changed his mind about supporting an African bid.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Nigeria could have a second chance of showing the
world what it could do when it co-host the 2000 African Nations'
Cup with Ghana.
</P>
<P>
"You have a wonderful opportunity of showing what you can do
because the selection of the host for the 2006 World Cup will be
in March, shortly after the African Nations' Cup," Blatter said.
</P>
<P>
The FIFA chief commended the Nigerian government for presenting
eight stadia for use in hosting the 22-day championship instead of
the required six.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the eight stadia were now a big legacy to the
West african country and would rate Nigeria high in facilities for
the future hosting of any FIFA championship.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, FIFA Director of Communication Keith
Copper said that "the coverage by the international media has been
extensive."
</P>
<P>
According to him, between four and 25 matches were being shown
in at least 95 countries while more than 80 countries have been
showing highlights of the matches at the championship which is
scheduled to end on April 24.

LONDON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Zalgiris Kaunas of Lithuania
defeated defending champions Kinder Bologna of Italy 82-74 to win
the EuroLeague basketball title in Munich, Germany on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kaunas, making their first appearance in the Final Four
tournament which decides Europe's showcase club competition,
displayed a fast, attractive game to upset the star-studded
Italian outfit, according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Kinder, trying to become the first team to retain a EuroLeague
crowm since Jugoplastika Split in 1990, could do little to counter
the Lithuanians's speed and accuracy.
</P>
<P>
Kaunas, who had knocked out Greek powerhouse Olympiakos 87-71
in their semifinal on Tuesday, led throughout the match to
complete their amazing run in style.
</P>
<P>
They resisted a brave finish from Kinder, who trailed them by
up to 19 points but closed the gap to five points with one minute
left.
</P>
<P>
A three-pointer from American guard Anthony Bowie then gave
Zalgiris a bit of air and they held on to their lead until the
final whistle.

<P>
LONDON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Ronnie O'Sullivan defeated Irish
qualifier Leo Finandez 10-2 to move into the second round of the
World Snooker Championships in Sheffield, England on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Englishman, seeded third in the tournament,
required just four frames for victory after establishing a 7-2
overnight lead.
</P>
<P>
After seeing Fernandez take the opening frame of the session
with a break of 80, O'Sullivan restored his five-frame advantage
and then claimed the next two frames to win.
</P>
<P>
He faces Joe Perry, conqueror of six-times champion Steve Davis,
in the next round.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion John Higgins built a commanding 8-0 lead
over Mark King in their second-round tie.
</P>
<P>
The Scot was in fine form, compiling two century and five half-
century breaks.
</P>
<P>
World number nine Stephen Lee of England held off a determined
fightback from John Lardner to go through to the second round.
</P>
<P>
Resuming with a 7-2 lead, Lee looked set to complete a
comfortable win when he won two of the first three frames of the
session to move within a frame of victory.
</P>
<P>
However, Lardner produced a battling display to take the next
four frames, cutting Lee's lead to 9-7.
</P>
<P>
But Lardner's hopes were dashed when Lee clinched the 17th
frame to complete a 10-7 win.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the second round match between former world champion
John Parrott and Chris Small was tied at 4-4. They resume on

<HEADLINE> Keegan Gives Youth a Chance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- England manager Kevin Keegan has
picked a number of youngsters and two Sunderland players in the
England squad for the friendly against Hungary in Budapest next
week.
</P>
<P>
Central defenders Jonathon Woodgate of Leeds United and Wes
Brown of Manchester United are called up, as is West Ham's Frank
Lampard, a star of recent Under-21 performances.
</P>
<P>
Sunderland's Michael Gray and Kevin Phillips are also selected,
fresh from their First Division Championship success.
</P>
<P>
Leicester's Emile Heskey is another surprise call-up despite
missing his side's win at Liverpool on Wednesday with injury.
</P>
<P>
A number of Manchester United and Arsenal players are rested
from the squad following the club's request that they be allowed
to concentrate on the title race.
</P>
<P>
David Beckham, Gary Neville and Tony Adams are absent, although
Martin Keown, David Seaman, Andy Cole and Phil Neville are among
those included.
</P>
<P>
An FA spokesman confirmed that there has been some "give and
take" between Keegan and club managers Alex Ferguson and Arsene
Wenger.
</P>
<P>
For Sunderland pair Gray and Phillips, the call-ups recognise
their roles in the Wearside club's return to the Premiership this
season.
</P>
<P>
It is less than a year since Gray missed the Wembley penalty
which cost Peter Reid's side a place in the top flight.
</P>
<P>
Phillips has scored 23 goals this season despite missing much
of the early part of the campaign with injury.
</P>
<P>
Woodgate joined up with the England squad for training before
last month's European Championship qualifying win over Poland at
Wembley.
</P>
<P>
But his call-up is still something of a surprise at the age of
19, given that he has not played for his country at under-21 level.
</P>
<P>
The same cannot be said of Lampard, who has captained the under-
21 side with distinction this season, scoring in all four of his
country's Euro qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
He follows in the footsteps of his father Frank Snr, who won
two full caps.
</P>
<P>
Brown has followed a similar path this season, being a regular
for the under-21 side, and he has impressed with a maturity beyond
his 19 years.
</P>
<P>
He was on the substitutes' bench for United's dramatic victory
over Juventus in Turin on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Heskey is given a second chance after being forced to pull out
of the squad which took on the Czech Republic in November through
injury.

<HEADLINE> Manchester United Fans Anger over Ticket Quota </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United fans have been
left fuming after discovering that they are only likely to receive
25,000 tickets for their Champions' Cup final on May 26 in
Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
News of the probable allocation for the Champions' Cup Final
against Bayern Munich in Barcelona's 115,000-seat Nou Camp stadium
has been branded "ridiculous" by United's supporters' organisation.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the Independent Manchester United Supporters'
Association, Lee Hodgkiss, said the decision would push black
market prices to astronomical levels.
</P>
<P>
A UEFA spokeswoman said that officials would meet on Friday to
decide on the precise allocation, but it would "probably" be 25,
000 for each of the finalists.
</P>
<P>
The remainder of the tickets would be allocated by Spanish
football authorities.
</P>
<P>
United supporters have waited 31 years for a European Cup final
since the historic victory of Sir Matt Busby's team over Benfica
at Wembley in 1968.
</P>
<P>
Hodgkiss said an allocation of 50,000 for each of the finalists
would be more realistic.
</P>
<P>
"This is the game every supporter will want to go to," he said.
"Most of them have waited a lifetime for a match like this.
</P>
<P>
"An allocation like this is a bit of a joke. There will be a
huge black market and supporters will have to travel without
tickets. To get less than half the stadium between us is
ridiculous. We get more than this for Wembley.

<HEADLINE> Arsenal Confirms Record Sponsorship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Arsenal announced on Thursday that
they have signed a three-year sponsorship deal with computer game
giants Sega Europe.
</P>
<P>
The new deal, which marks the end of the Gunners' 18-year
association with electronics company JVC, will start from July 1.
</P>
<P>
Sega have earmarked a reported 60 million pounds to promote the
September launch of their Dreamcast console, and the deal with
Arsenal follows the company's sponsorship of the Champions' League.
</P>
<P>
The massive sponsorship package, which is expected to dwarf
Manchester United's agreement with Sharp, will provide a major
boost to the spending power of manager Arsene Wenger.
</P>
<P>
Reports have suggested Arsenal stand to make a staggering 12
million pounds (about 19 million U.S. dollars) from the deal.

However, the EU member states are still divided on such

The Australian:
</P>

after a decision Thursday by a senior office holder to lodge a
formal complaint over suspected membership dishonest scheme.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- Seven months after increasing Sydney's Olympic budget by 142
million Australian dollars (90 million U.S. dollars), the Sydney

interest in the wake of the international storm of revelations
about Olympic corruption.

<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Mallorca beat Chelsea 1-0 in the
second leg in Palma De Mallorca on Thursday, advancing 2-1 on
aggregate for the first and also the last time to the final of the
European Cup Winners' Cup, which is to be abolished next season.
</P>
<P>
Argentine-born Leo Biagini scored the sole goal with a header
in the 14th minute, giving Spain a presence in one of the three
finals of the European soccer tournaments as powerhouses Barcelona,
Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid have failed this season.
</P>
<P>
Reigning champions Chelsea fought back in the second half and
had several close chances but could not break down the solid
defence of Mallorca.
</P>
<P>
Mallorca coach Hector Cuper of Argentina praised his side's
positive approach to the game, saying "we had a winning mentality.
We knew we had to go out and win because we would have lost if we
had gone for the draw."
</P>
<P>
Chelsea player-coach Gianluca Vialli was disappointed at his
team's departure from the last ever Cup Winners' Cup. "We knew we
had to play offensive football and score. However, we only had a
few chances and their goalkeeper made a few great saves."
</P>
<P>
The match started with both sides determining to attack.
Mallorca' Spanish defender Marcelino Elena went close with another
header late in the first half.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea started the second half in more imaginative fashion
after Celestine Babayaro replaced injured Graeme Le Saux, but were
restrained by Mallorca with their familiar counter attacks.
</P>
<P>
Midway through the second half, Roberto Di Matteo's hit was
tipped onto the bar by Argentine keeper Carlos Roa.
</P>
<P>
Mallorca will play Lazio of Italy in the final at Birmingham on
May 19.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council on Thursday welcomed a peace accord signed in
Sirte, Libya, last Sunday by some of the countries involved in
a regional conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The accord was signed by the presidents DRC, Uganda, Chad,
Eritrea and Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, Council President Alain Dejammet of
France said:"The members of the Council welcome the efforts of
African leaders convened in Sirte upon the initiative of Colonel
Gaddafi in contributing towards a lasting solution of the conflict
in DRC."
</P>
<P>
The Council particularly welcomed the fact that the signatories
had decided on an immediate cessation of hostilities and called on
the other parties to the conflict also to commit themselves
similarly.
</P>
<P>
The Council stressed that efforts must be made by all parties
to this end.
</P>
<P>
Rebels have been fighting to topple DRC President Laurent
Kabila since last August. The Rebellion has grown into a regional
war.
</P>
<P>
The Council also called on all parties to comply with an April
9 Council resolution that demanded an immediate halt to the
fighting in the country and called for the immediate signing of a
ceasefire agreement allowing the orderly withdrawal of all foreign
forces.

<HEADLINE> Albanian Chief of Staff Inspects Troops in North Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Chief of Staff of the Albanian
army, Brigade General Aleks Andoni, Thursday inspected troops of
the Second Infantry Division in the northern prefecture of Kukes.
</P>
<P>
The inspection was seen as a move to check the preparedness of
the Albanian army for any eventuality that could rise from a
possible NATO ground offensive against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He held a closed-door meeting with the governor of the
prefecture, Qemal Elezi, to discuss the present situation in the
prefecture which borders the Yugoslavia province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo has been subject to extensive NATO bombardment since
March 24 when NATO began to launch air strikes on Serb targets.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian news agency ATA said that Andoni praised the local
people for their readiness not only for the hospitality to Kosovo
refugees but also for defending the territorial integrity of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Albania has been accusing Serb troops of making provocations by
firing across the border in the direction of the posts manned by
Albanian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Albanian Information Ministry Musa Ulqini alleged Thursday that
Serb soldiers fired Thursday at the border crossing at Dobrune at
7:50 a.m. local time in Kukes Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
An Albanian soldier was wounded but his life was out of danger,
the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia had been denying similar allegations before.
</P>
<P>
Albanian army units are guarding the borders in north Albania,
Ulqini said.
</P>
<P>
Only 133 Kosovo refugees crossed the border to enter Albania
Wednesday and the total number of Kosovo refugees in Albania has
risen to 360,000.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder:  Russia Remains NATO's Security Partner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN April 22 (Xinhua)--German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
said Thursday that Russia remained the most important security
partner for NATO.
</P>
<P>
But, Moscow needs to meet its responsibility to play a
constructive role in creating European security, especially in
Kosovo, Schroeder told the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Russia has been severely hitting NATO's hardline policy against
Yugoslavia since the organization began the air campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Resolving the Kosovo crisis was not just about military victory
but also about creating a political and economic perspective for
the entire Balkan region, Schroeder said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about this week's Washington ceremony marking NATO's
founding in 1949, Schroeder said it would not be a celebration but
rather a show of unity for the "common European values of freedom,
democracy and human rights".
</P>
<P>
The NATO ceremony would stress the Alliance remained open to
new members following the admission of Poland, Hungary and the
Czech Republic last month, Schroeder said. NATO now has 19 member
states.
</P>
<P>
" Exporting political stability makes our continent more
secure," he said.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said he remained by the view that the European Union
(EU) needed to establish its own political and military decision-
making mechanism.
</P>
<P>
"The Transatlantic partnership can only prosper when it takes
into account the growing European responsibility," said Schroeder,
adding, "this is also the view of our American friends.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Poverty Arduous Task: Wolfensohn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Fighting poverty is a
difficult task for the World Bank, James D. Wolfensohn, head of
the bank, said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"I worry a lot about the issue of poverty. It's a tough issue,"
he said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn said that the issue of poverty is very serious as
the number of people in poverty is increasing.
</P>
<P>
The absolute number of people in poverty might reach 1.5
billion at the end of this year from 1.2 to 1.3 billion at
present, he said.
</P>
<P>
"And in the next 25 years, we'll add another two billion people
to the planet," he added. "That is something that keeps me awake
at nights."
</P>
<P>
He said that the financial crisis in some countries have
affected many people and made their lives more difficult.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank head also expressed his concern over the
decrease of overseas development assistance to the poor countries.
</P>
<P>
Last year the overseas development assistance amounted to 33
billion dollars, a decrease of 40 percent since the beginning of
the decade.
</P>
<P>
"It's the lowest level in 50 years," he said. It is around a
quarter of one percent of the GDP of developed countries while the
target is one percent.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very serious issue so far as we're concerned," he
added.

<P>
BONN, April 22 (Xinhua) -- German leaders indicated Thursday
that NATO should suspend air strikes on Yugoslavia if Belgrade
begins withdrawing troops from Kosovo, an apparent policy
divergence from the U.S. position.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government, together with Britain, has been stressing
that Western demands must be fully met before halting attacks.
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder told the parliament that NATO
terms for halting strikes were "an end to violence in Kosovo;
withdrawal of all Yugoslav troops, special police and paramilitary
forces; and the deployment of an international force in Kosovo to
oversee return of refugees".
</P>
