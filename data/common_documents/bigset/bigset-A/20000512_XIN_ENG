<HEADLINE> 1 Bln Population A "Serious Matter": Indian PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The runaway population growth was bound to have a serious
impact on the nation's economic, natural and other resources,
Vajpayee was quoted as saying by the Press Trust of India (PTI).
</P>
<P>
There was need for introspection over where the country went
wrong and how it could stabilize its population, the prime
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Conceding there were flaws in the four-decade-old population
policy, Vajpayee said population stabilization could not be
achieved without all-round socio-economic development, the PTI
reported.
</P>
<P>
Another major population-related news on Thursday was that the
Indian government announced a jumbo-sized National Commission on
Population headed by Vajpayee to review, monitor and implement the
recently adopted National Population Policy 2000.
</P>
<P>
The 100-member commission, with Planning Commission Deputy
Chairman K C Pant as its vice chairman, includes ministers for
finance, health and family welfare, leaders of the Opposition in
both Houses of Parliament, some captains of industry and eminent
personalities from various walks of life, the PTI reported.
</P>
<P>
"The commission has the mandate to give direction for
implementation of the National Population Policy with the view to
achieve the goals set in the population policy," Pant was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The policy, which was tabled in the Parliament for approval
recently, aims to achieve population stabilization by 2045 and cut
the Total Fertility Rate of the country to 2.1 by 2010, which
means each couple will have only two children.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 11 (Xinhua) -- A Pakistani Foreign Office
official on Thursday billed as false the Indian allegations that
800 intruders have crossed into Indian held Kashmir(IHK) from
across the Line of Control (LoC), according to the Associated
Press of Pakistan (APP).
</P>
<P>
The official said it is "completely incorrect," when asked to
comment on the reported Indian allegation that about 800 intruders
have sneaked into IHK from across the LoC.
</P>
<P>
It is recalled that Pakistan has many a time called for
stationing neutral observers on the LoC to know the truth in this
regard but India has not accepted this proposal, the official said.

"In no way the problem can be solved without India playing a
positive role," Solheim told the press here following his talks
with Indian External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh on the
situation in the island country.
</P>
<P>
Solheim, who has been trying to facilitate a dialogue between
the Sri Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE), was here on a day's visit to discuss with India the
situation in Sri Lanka. He also held a meeting with Indian Foreign
Secretary Lalit Mansingh.
</P>
<P>
An Indian External Affairs Ministry spokesman said Solheim
shared India's approach that the solution to the ethnic conflict
lay with the Sri Lankans themselves in a manner by which all
communities could realize their aspirations within the context of
the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
ruled out any possibility of a change in India's policy in the
event of fall of Jaffna to the LTTE, which has launched an all-out
offensive against government troops to wrest control of the
northern Sri Lankan peninsula.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Blames U.S., Japan for Blocking Its ADB Entry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) has condemned Japan and the United States for
their attempts to block its entry into the Asian Development Bank
(ADB).
</P>
<P>
The official Korean Central News Agency said in a commentary on
Thursday that the U.S. and Japan ruled out the DPRK's membership
in the ADB at the bank's annual meeting in Thailand on May 7, on
the grounds that the DPRK is a "terrorist state."
</P>
<P>
"The ADB should not attach any political strings to the
application of any country to join it and any member of the
Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific is
entitled to be a member country of the ADB," said the commentary.
</P>
<P>
"It is quite illogical for the U.S. and Japan to attach absurd
political conditionality to the bid of the DPRK, a member of the
commission, to join the ADB."
</P>
<P>
The news agency said Japan's behavior "clearly indicates that
its talk about the improved relations with the DPRK is nothing but
hypocrisy and there is no change in its hostile policy to isolate
and stifle the DPRK economically."
</P>
<P>
The commentary warned that the current talks between the DPRK
and Japan for the normalization of relations could be damaged.
</P>
<P>
"This servile diplomatic posture of Japan may imperil the fate
of the talks," it said.

<HEADLINE> Foreign investment Influx in Russia Drops 90 Percent in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment inflow into
Russia plummeted over 90 percent to 1.3 billion U.S. dollars last
year from 20.8 billion dollars of 1998, said the Central Bank of
Russia on Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, foreign direct investment rose to 2.9 billion dollars
in 1999 from 2.8 billion dollars in the previous year, shows
balance of payments data in the Central Bank's newsletter.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, foreign loans and credits to the government sector
declined to 2.7 billion dollars from 6.7 billion dollars in 1998.
They included 1.3 billion dollars in untied financing: about 1.0
billion dollars in loans from international financial
organizations and a loan of 0.3 billion dollars from the Japanese
Bank for International Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Actual government payments for foreign loans and credits
totaled 7.2 billion dollars, including 5.6 billion on the
principle and 1.6 billion in interest, while the due payments
stood 12.2 billion dollars. About 3.0 billion dollars in payments
were permitted to be overdue.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of foreign banks in the Russian commercial
banking system climbed to 10.7 percentage as of January 1, 2000,
up 70 percent from the index of previous year.
</P>
<P>
Foreign direct investment into this sector increased to 0.5
billion dollars (including subordinated credits), compared with an
initially estimated 0.3 billion dollars, in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Last year, foreign currency in cash brought into Russia
amounted to 11.7 billion dollars, down from 20.7 billion dollars
in 1998. Some 8.3 billion out of the sum flowed into Russia by the
banking system.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, 12.6 billion dollars were taken out of the
country in comparison with 21.6 billion in 1998, including 5.4
billion dollars through unregistered trade (shuttle traders) and
another 5.3 billion by tourists.
</P>
<P>
The official foreign currency reserves went up by 1.8 billion
dollars in 1999 as a result of operations reflected in the balance
of payments, said the Central Bank.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Detains Panamanian Wild Animal Trafficker </HEADLINE>

<P>
BOGOTA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Colombian airport authorities has
detained a Panamanian national who was trying to take illegally
out of the country several animals of exotic species, local
police said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian citizen seized on Thursday night, had 200 "Choco
" frogs and 320 "mata mata" turtles, said a police official in the
El Dorado airport of Bogota.
</P>
<P>
The man told the authorities that he was taking the animals as
a souvenir, but the police said that the alleged wildlife species
trafficker wanted to send them to Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The "Choco" frogs, which live in jungle areas of the west of
the country, are in danger of extinction, while the "mata mata"
turtles are coveted for their meat in Japan and in other Asian
nations, explained the official.
</P>
<P>
The man was put under the care of the attorney office and the
animals were sent to the state Environment Department in the
Colombian capital.

<HEADLINE> Euro Stability Can Be Maintained: Duisenberg </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The governor of the European
Central Bank said on Friday that the internal stability of the
single currency would be maintained and the euro will be a strong
currency in the future.
</P>
<P>
Wim Duisenberg said: "The economic growth in Europe is
confirmed under a climate of price stability and people are able
to have confidence in their bank savings and pension plans. The
internal stability of the euro will be maintained."
</P>
<P>
The ECB chief made this remark while attending a ceremony
marking the 150th anniversary of the Belgian National Bank in
Brussels on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Dutchman added that the single currency would be a strong
currency in the future.
</P>
<P>
The European Central Bank left its key interest rates unchanged
on Thursday though some were speculating another rate hike as an
attempt to put a brake on the tailspin of the euro.
</P>
<P>
Boosting interest rates is one of the weapons the ECB has to
bolster the value of the faltering single currency now used only
as book-keeping credits in 11 of the 15 European Union member
states.
</P>
<P>
The ECB just raised its benchmark lending interests two weeks
ago to 3.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
Speculation has turned to whether the European Central Bank
would intervene in foreign exchange markets to buoy the euro by
buying up the currency and selling the United States dollars.
</P>
<P>
The single currency lost nearly 25 percent in value against the
dollar, bottoming out at 0.8845 against the dollar last Thursday
for an all-time low.
</P>
<P>
The head of Germany's Wholesale and Foreign Trade Association
Michael Fuchs said on Monday that the European Central Bank should
intervene if the euro drops to 85 cents, well below its peak at 1.
18 dollars just after its inauguration on January 1 last year.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Arrests 80 Alleged Drug Traffickers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Colombian and U.S. authorities
arrested 80 persons Friday as part of the "Cannabis Operation"
against drug trafficking, Colombian police said.
</P>
<P>
The cases of the Colombian citizens captured in the United
States will be transferred to the Attorney General Office of
Colombia jurisdiction, which will request their extradition, said
General Luis Alfredo Rodriguez, head of the metropolitan police in
the city of Medellin.
</P>
<P>
The seized persons were allegedly members of an international
marihuana trafficking ring that used the city of Medellin as its
center of operations, said Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) took
part in the coordination of the detentions.
</P>
<P>
The criminal organization supplied itself with the drug mainly
in the El Cauca department, where it acquired this year 15 tons
marihuana. Among them, five tons were sent to the United States
during the same period, said Gen. Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very important antidrug operation," said the police
chief, explaining that the drug trafficking network was
dismembered almost completely with the detention of packagers,
distributors, and retailers of marihuana.

<HEADLINE> HongkongBank And Hang Seng Bank Ratings Upgraded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 12 (Xinhua) - Fitch IBCA, the International Rating
Agency, has upgraded the Individual ratings of Hongkong and
Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HongkongBank) and Hang Seng
Bank to 'A/B' from 'B'.
</P>
<P>
HongkongBank's Long-term foreign currency rating, which is
unchanged at A+, is constrained by Hongkong's sovereign ceiling.
Its Short-term and Support ratings of 'F1+' and '2', respectively,
are affirmed, as is Heng Seng's Support rating of '3'.
</P>
<P>
Fitch IBCA said Friday although Hongkong's banks suffered from
a deterioration in asset quality and a substantial increase in
loan loss provisions during the Asian financial crisis in 1997-
1999, they fared well when compared with their peers in other part
of regions.
</P>
<P>
During the crisis, no bank in Hongkong went under or needed
support from the regulators or the government. In short, Hongkong'
s financial institutions have remained generally solid during the
financial turmoil, thanks to their sound condition and good
management, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The rating upgrade reflects the subject banks' solid core
operations, sound capital ratios and the improving asset quality,
Fitch IBCA argued.
</P>
<P>
These banks face challenges in the competitive Hongkong market
and the growth of "e-banking" but they have excellent track
records and have emerged from the crisis in good shape, the agency
added.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Protestants to Discuss IRA Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's main Protestant
party on Friday set May 20 for a special convention to discuss the
Irish Republican Army's latest move on arms decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) decided to hold a special
meeting of its 850-member ruling council on May 20, just two days
before the British and Irish governments' target date for a
restoration of the Northern Irish assembly, to consider a return
to power-sharing government with the Catholic republicans.
</P>
<P>
The move followed an IRA statement last weekend in which the
paramilitary organization offered to put its arms "beyond use".
</P>
<P>
But UUP leader David Trimble said he was still seeking further
clarification of the IRA's statement about putting its weapons "
beyond use".
</P>
<P>
"I must make it clear that the calling of the meeting does not
mean that we have committed ourselves to endorsing any set of
proposals," he said.
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, Gerry Adams, leader of the IRA's political wing
Sinn Fein, issued a warning to unionists not to try to introduce
more pre-conditions into the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein's chief negotiator Martin McGuinness told a press
conference in west Belfast that he had been informed by the police
on Friday of a threat to his life.
</P>
<P>
He said it had been made by a previously unknown Organisation
through a local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland's political institutions were suspended by the
government in February during an impasse between the Ulster
Unionists and Sinn Fein over the IRA's refusal to start
disarmament and continued power-sharing.

<HEADLINE> New U.S. Embassy Compound Opens in Moscow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 12 (Xinhua) -- A new U.S. Embassy compound was
officially launched into use in downtown Moscow Friday after a 20-
year construction history with a Soviet-U.S. spy scandal involved
in it.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador James Collins and the U.S. marine guards of the
embassy hoisted the U.S. national flag above the main building of
the compound, whose construction was suspended in 1985 after the
Americans discovered that the complex was stuffed with bugging
devices and wiretappings.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, Soviet KGB chief Vadim Bakatin handed U.S. Ambassador
Richard Strauss technical documents on the installation and use of
the spy devices.
</P>
<P>
American Embassy sources said that most of the embassy staff
have moved onto the new premises by now.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Coffee Drops to 3rd Place as Export Product </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The country exported 239.4 million dollars worth of coal during
that period, 4.8 million dollars more than the sales of coffee.
Oil exports amounted to 1.153 billion dollars during the same
period, according to the National Statistics Department (DANE).
</P>
<P>
Coffee was the first Colombian commodity for export for many
years, but by the middle of the 1980's decade big oil fields were
discovered and coffee dropped to second place.
</P>
<P>
However, the country is exporting more coal than coffee,
because of the coal sales growth, but also because of the deep
crisis the coffee sector is going through.
</P>
<P>
Coal exports growth is attributed in part to the fact that the
government signed a contract for the exploitation of Cerrejon Zona
Norte (North Zone) in the north of the country, and permitted the
entrance of third parties into the coal mines railways and ports
infrastructure to promote sales.
</P>
<P>
The coffee sector has not been so fortunate because of the low
international prices and the drop in the national production.
</P>
<P>
Brazil and Colombia are seeking an agreement among several
producing countries to retain their exports by six million bags,
but Mexico has rejected the plan.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Gazette Instrument for Land Acquisition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government will
gazette a legal instrument which will repeal the Land Acquisition
Act to conform with the land constitutional powers, President
Robert Mugabe said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting with representatives of the
 Commercial Farmers Union (CFU) and veterans of Zimbabwe's 1970s
war of liberation who have occupied more than 1,000 white-owned
commercial farms since February, Mugabe said he would invoke his
Presidential powers to facilitate the legal instrument.
</P>
<P>
"The instrument that will enable the government to acquire land
 practically will be ready next week," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government recently made a constitutional amendment to
enable it acquire commercial farms for resettlement, for which it
would only pay compensation for improvements.
</P>
<P>
The special Presidential powers would be in force for six
months within which a new parliament, which is expected to ratify
the new act will be elected.
</P>
<P>
The President met the two groups for three hours, although his
meeting with the war veterans lasted more than four hours, as he
remained in closed talks with them after the farmers had left.
</P>
<P>
The war veterans and peasant villagers have been occupying
farms since February, in an effort to reclaim land seized by
British settlers who colonized the country in the 1890s. At
least three white farmers have died in violent clashes in the
land seizures.
</P>
<P>
The Friday meeting was the second to discuss the on-going
invasions.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said the ex-combatants would continue to occupy the
farms, but he stressed that they should not disturb the farmers
and "should not stretch their hands in the direction of wanting
to acquire property on the farms."
</P>
<P>
The president also denounced the killing of farmers and said
that violence must be stopped.
</P>
<P>
He said, police would continue to be on the lookout to ensure
there was peace on the occupied farms.
</P>
<P>
Former CFU President Nick Swanepoel said the talks held between
the three groups so far had been going on "very well."
</P>
<P>
"The way forward has been sooner than we anticipated," said
Swanepoel, and added he welcomed the land commission.
</P>
<P>
On the proposed land commission, war veterans leader Chenjerai
Hunzvi said, "We are part of it and we are happy with it."

<HEADLINE> S. African Oil Industry to Increase Black Empowerment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from South
Africa's oil industry and the government met on Friday in Cape
Town to discuss the formation of a six-member task team to work
for the achievement of 25 percent black economic empowerment in
the industry.
</P>
<P>
 The meeting comes on the heels of Thursday's speech by
Minerals and Energy Affairs Minister Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka in
which she cited November as a deadline for an implementation plan
to achieve the goal, Colin McCleland, Managing Director of the
South African Petroleum Industry Association (SAPIA), said on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
McCleland told reporters that representatives from the oil
industry had met with government officials early on Friday in a
"procedural meeting" for the task team. They would all be
nominating individuals to serve on the task team.
</P>
<P>
He said he was satisfied with the Minister's sense of urgency
surrounding the implementation plan, as well as the idea of
appointing a task team. Until now the industry had been unsure as
to the priority accorded by the government to restructuring.
</P>
<P>
The November deadline had helped to clarify this, he was
quoted by the South African Press Association as saying.
</P>
<P>
 According to the government's policy set out over a year ago
in its White Paper on Energy, the milestone of 25 percent black
participation in South Africa's liquid fuels industry must be
achieved before deregulation of the industry can occur.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper requires "the sustainable presence, ownership
or control by historically disadvantaged South Africans of ap-
proximately a quarter of all facets of the liquid fuels industry
or plans to achieve this. "
</P>
<P>
In her budget presentation to Parliament on Thursday,
Mlambo-Ngcuka said the implementation plan had to be agreed by the
government, SAPIA (representing the major international oil
companies) and AMEF (the African Minerals and Energy Forum,
representing black-owned oil companies such as AfricOil, Exel and
Tepco).
</P>
<P>
She, however, recognized the difficulties involved in
attaining such a goal, saying: "The ownership structure of oil
companies poses a major constraint in attaining empowerment
objectives."
</P>
<P>
Of the 35 billion rand (5 billion US dollars) invested in the
highly capital-intensive sector, only 5.5 percent was black-owned
at present. At the same time, only 3.2 percent of the industry's
total operational profits of about 5.5 billion rand (785 million
dollars) per year accrued to blacks.
</P>
<P>
"The historical dominance of the major established foreign
companies present a significant hurdle to the growth of the local
companies," she observed.

<HEADLINE> AngloGold Launches Joint Venture with Canadian Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 12 (Xinhua) -- AngloGold, the world's
largest gold producer, has signed an exploration agreement with
Canadian minerals corporation Rubicon in its first foray into
Canada.
</P>
<P>
The South African mining group already has exploration
operations in 10 other countries spanning four continents.
</P>
<P>
AngloGold said on Friday it had signed a formal agreement with
Rubicon Minerals Corporation for a joint venture in Rubicon's Red
Lake Gold project in North West Ontario.
</P>
<P>
Exploration on the Red Lake Joint Venture, as the project will
be known, is expected to begin this month.
</P>
<P>
Rubicon is a major landholder in the Red Lake Gold district,
controlling over 1,200 claims containing new gold discoveries and
a number of drill targets.
</P>
<P>
This includes the Dorian-McCuaig corridor, which is
interpreted to be a 2.5 kilometer by one kilometer extension of
the prolific Mine Trend.
</P>
<P>
The Mine Trend, which includes Placer Dome's Campbell Mine and
Goldcorp' s Red Lake Mine, has yielded more than 15 million ounces
of gold production.
</P>
<P>
The Rubicon-AngloGold agreement calls for AngloGold to make an
initial contribution of 3 million US dollars over five years to
earn a 60 percent interest in the joint venture, including a
firm commitment to spend 300, 000 dollars by January 24, 2001.
</P>
<P>
AngloGold said it could earn an additional 10 percent interest
by paying Rubicon 250,000 dollars within 90 days of vesting its
60 percent interest.
</P>
<P>
Rubicon will manage the project until the first 1 million
dollars has been spent or until the second anniversary of the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Canada, AngloGold has exploration operations in the
South American countries of Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador
and Peru, as well as Australia, the United States, South Africa
and Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Experts Call for Tougher Control of Diamond Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Experts attending an
international Diamond meeting on Friday called for tougher
control of diamond sales which they claimed had fueled wars in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Diamond Technical Forum, chaired by South African Minister
of Minerals and Energy Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, urged governments
to create an environment for the fair and transparent trading of
diamonds in order to prevent smuggling.
</P>
<P>
The African continent must take the lead in ending the problem,
with help from the diamond industry and governments elsewhere,
the experts agreed at the meeting in Kimberley, about 300
kilometers southwest of Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations estimates that Angolan anti-government
rebels have earned between 3 billion and 4 billion dollars over
the past eight years from diamond sales and investments from the
profits - money that helped the rebels relaunch the war in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Rebels in Sierra Leone also buy arms from their diamond sales
on the international market.
</P>
<P>
The participants, including representatives from the
governments of the United States, Britain, Belgium and from
non-governmental organizations, also urged the diamond industry to
contribute toward the development "of the communities and
countries in which they derive their wealth."
</P>
<P>
"This will ensure that those communities derive sustainable
livelihoods during and beyond the mining phase," the Forum said in
a statement at the end of the two-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is to be followed by a ministerial-level meeting
in July.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 12 (Xinhua) -- One militiaman of the pro-Israeli
South Lebanon Army (SLA) was killed and another injured on Friday
in attacks launched by Hezbollah guerrillas on the position of
Rashaf in south Lebanon, Lebanese National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah guerrillas fired rockets and mortar shells at four
positions of SLA, which is funded, armed and trained by Israel,
Lebanese security sources said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes, backed by SLA mortar attacks, launched
several air raids against suspected guerrilla positions in south
Lebanon, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
This week, Commander of SLA Antoine Lahd submitted a letter to
President Emile Lahoud asking for amnesty for his 3,000 SLA
militiamen after Israel's withdrawal from south Lebanon by July.
The appeal has been rejected by Lahoud and Prime Minister Salim
Hoss.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel stepped up its pace to dismantle military
positions in south Lebanon which Israel occupied in 1978. On
Thursday night Israeli army abandoned the Masharoun military post.
Israel has kicked off its withdrawal process since the beginning of
May.
</P>
<P>
Israel last month formally informed the United Nations of its
decision to withdraw from south Lebanon by July.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian- and Syrian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has
been spearheading a guerrilla war to oust Israeli troops and their
allies SLA from south Lebanon, where Israel carved out the self-
styled security zone in 1985 with a claimed aim of protecting its
northern settlements from cross-border guerrilla attacks.

<HEADLINE> Students Freed After Detention for Cairo Riot Over Book </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Students of Egypt's Al-Azhar
University arrested during a recent riot over a book they denounced
as blasphemous were released on Friday, the country's Middle East
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
State security prosecutors on Tuesday ordered the detention of
75 students of the religious university after violent clashes
between police and hundreds of students, who demanded that Culture
Minister Farouk Hosni resign over the book.
</P>
<P>
The student protests erupted on Sunday night after Hosni was
attacked in the Islamic newspaper, Al-Shaab, over "Feast of the Sea
Algae" written by Syrian writer Haider Haider in 1983.
</P>
<P>
Up to 2,000 students continued a peaceful protest inside the
university campus until Thursday night, when President of Al-Azhar
University Ahmed Omar Hashem informed them that the government had
agreed to let the detainees go ahead with exams.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said they could be rearrested at a later stage
because prosecutors had not closed the case file.
</P>
<P>
The students were accused of "demonstrating, holding up traffic,
destroying police and citizens' cars, resisting public security
forces and burning public and private buildings."
</P>
<P>
Al-Azhar, Egypt's leading Islamic institution, is to review a
report issued on Wednesday by a literary committee which said the
novel had "distinguished artistic value" and had been deliberately
misrepresented.

<HEADLINE> Annan Urges Eritrea, Ethiopia to Cease Fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.N. chief "deeply deplores the resumption of large-scale
fighting" between the two Horn of Africa countries and urgently
appeals to them to return to the process of negotiation in order
to find a peaceful solution to the conflict, U.N. spokesman Fred
Eckhard told reporters in New York.
</P>
<P>
"The differences between the two counties cannot justify in any
way the great loss in human lives they already have suffered and
stand to suffer further," Eckhard quoted Annan as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia launched a fresh offensive against Eritrea shortly
after midnight Friday. The move followed the collapse of peace
talks between them in Algiers and the shuttle diplomacy by a U.N.
Security Council delegation which visited both countries this week.
</P>
<P>
Thousands have died in the border war during the past two years.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 12 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Friday appointed Zbigniew Wlosowicz of Poland as Acting
Special Representative and Chief of Mission of the United Nations
Forces in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Zbigniew Wlosowicz will succeed James Holger of Chile,
whose term will expire on May 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General has informed the Security Council of the
appointment.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Forces in Cyprus (UNFICYP) was established
by the Security Council Resolution 186 of 1964, with the mandate
to prevent a recurrence of fighting between the Greek Cypriot and
Turkish Cypriot communities and to contribute to the maintenance
and restoration of law and order and a return to normal conditions.
</P>
<P>
Following the hostilities in 1974, the Security Council
adopted a number of resolutions expanding the mandate of UNFICYP
to include supervising a de facto ceasefire, which came into force
on August 16, 1974, and maintaining a buffer zone between the
lines of the Cyprus National Guard and of the Turkish and Turkish
Cypriot forces.
</P>
<P>
In the absence of a political settlement to the Cyprus problem,
UNFICYP continues its presence on the Island.

<HEADLINE> Andranik Markarian Appointed Armenian Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Armenia's Republican Party leader,
Andranik Markarian, was appointed by the president as prime
minister on Friday, Interfax quoted the Armenian presidential
press service as saying.
</P>
<P>
Markarian was born in 1951 a teacher's family in the capital of
Yerevan. He graduated from the Yerevan Polytechnic Institute in
1972 as a computer engineer. He worked in scientific research
centers until 1990 and from 1990-1993 he was a department head on
a special programs board.
</P>
<P>
From 1995-1999, Markarian served as a deputy of the National
Assembly (Armenian parliament) of the first convocation. In 1999,
he was reelected parliamentary deputy as the leader of the Unity
faction, the parliamentary majority.
</P>
<P>
He has been engaged in politics since 1965, became a member of
the underground National United Party in 1968, and was arrested
and sentenced to two years in prison in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Markarian joined the Republican Party and became a member of
the party council in 1992, chaired the council from 1993 to 1997
and has been chairman of the party since 1997.
</P>
<P>
He is married and has two daughters, a son and grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
The Unity parliamentary majority, composed of the Armenian
Popular Party and the Republican Party, supported Markarian's
candidacy, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
In early May, President Kocharian dismissed Aram Sarkisian, who
had been appointed premier last November following the murder of
his brother, prime minister Vazgen Sarkisian, in the Armenian
parliament building.

<HEADLINE> WHO Warns of Alarming Health Situation in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The World Health
Organization (WHO) on Friday warned the international community
that the health situation of the civilian population in the areas
of conflict in the north of Sri Lanka is under severe threat.
</P>
<P>
Lack of medical supplies, including basic child care drugs,
means both government and voluntary health services in the area
are no longer able to provide preventive and curative health
services to the population.
</P>
<P>
Even Vaccines against childhood diseases are in acute shortage,
with the lack of polio vaccines completely exhausted.
</P>
<P>
The population in northern Sri Lanka is especially vulnerable
due to the large numbers of internally displaced people, whose
access to health services was already precarious before the
current escalation of conflict. Malaria is highly endemic and on
the rise, which poses a serious threat to the whole island since
malaria control programs have collapsed.
</P>
<P>
WHO appeals to all parties involved to urgently assist all
health care providers in the affected areas to ensure they have
the means to render proper health care to the civilian population.

NAIROBI, May 12 (Xinhua) -- A total of 177 member states of the
 Convention on Biological Diversity will meet in Kenya's capital
Nairobi between May 15 and 26 to promote a more sustainable
relationship between humanity and the earth's dwindling biological
diversity.
</P>
<P>
The fifth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the
Convention will bring together some 1,500 government officials
and observers.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will examine progress in addressing the threats to
biological diversity with the aim of identifying practical

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President to Chair Ugandan, Rwandan Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa will chair the one-day summit between Uganda and Rwanda in
Tanzania's northwestern town of Mwanza on Saturday, officials here
confirmed on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Acting Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs and International Cooperation Joshua Opanga told the
official Daily News on Friday that the summit between Ugandan
President Yoweri Museveni and his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame
is aimed at enhancing neighboring ties.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the summit will dwell on the recent clashes
between the two countries' troops based in the northeastern town
of Kisangani in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the
official categorically denied it.
</P>
<P>
"The summit is just an ordinary forum for neighbors to consult
on each other on issues of mutual interest among us," Opanga was
quoted as saying, without giving details on specific issues to be
discussed.
</P>
<P>
However, recent developments in the Great Lakes region suggest
the Mwanza summit will become a forum geared at trying to bring
closer the two central African states following their clashes in
Kisangani, which has increased military tensions both in the DRC
and along the common border of Uganda and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Following the clashes, a United Nations delegation visited
president Museveni in his hometown of Mbarara last week to ask him
meet Kagame in a bid to end their hostility as a continued
military confrontation in the DRC between the two countries is
regarded as a threat to the Lusaka Peace Accord signed last July.

NAIROBI, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenya will help to train Rwandan
teachers and police officers, said Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi during his one- day visit to Rwanda on Friday.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Rwanda, Moi and his Rwandan counterpart
Paul Kagame held talks on bilateral and regional issues.

in Rwanda' s reconstruction process and the people of Rwanda were
happy with President Moi's peace initiatives in the great lake
region.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral relations between the two countries, Kagame said,
would flourish and Rwanda could benefit from Kenya's experience.
</P>
<P>
President Moi said their two countries had longstanding ties,
which form a strong foundation for greater cooperation in such
areas as trade and security.
</P>
<P>
Moi advised that the continent's leaders should be more
concerned with the security and prosperity of their peoples,
saying Africa should stop being the world's laughing stock for
the bloodthirst of many of its leaders.
</P>
<P>
On the request of President Kagame, Moi agreed that Kenya would
consider re-activating its embassy in Kigali, the capital of
Rwanda.

UNITED NATIONS, May 12 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said on Friday that the United Nations would be able to
stabilize the situation and then move forward its mandate in
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, Annan said the situation on the ground
seemed relatively calm today and the United Nations was continuing
its efforts to stabilize the situation and consolidate its forces.
</P>
<P>
"Additional forces are arriving, which should be in the next
couple of weeks from Jordan, India and Bangladesh. We are
coordinating our efforts also with the British troops at the port,
" Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"We are still trying to get to release our detainees, which I
hope will be possible soon," the U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he had a preliminary discussion with Bernard Miyet,
the U.N. peacekeeping chief who had just returned from his visit
to Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
"I'm expecting a full report from him today and over the
weekend. Then we will make further judgments as to what needs to
be done once I have studied his detailed report," he added.
</P>
<P>
About 8,700 U.N. peacekeepers arrived in Sierra Leone last
month to monitor a peace accord signed by the Government of Sierra
Leone and the Revolutionary United Front(RUF) rebels in July last
year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 500 peacekeepers were taken hostage by the rebels
last week which triggered the current crisis.

<HEADLINE> Greece to Deepen Structural Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Greek government Friday decided
to speed up the pace of structural reforms in a bid to boost the
country's economic competition.
</P>
<P>
During a cabinet meeting, which was chaired by Greek Prime
Minister Costas Simitis, the Greek government set out three
priorities in its economic policy for the period 2000-2001, which
includes speedier structural reforms, implementation of all pre-
election pledges for social benefits and completion of
negotiations for the country's entry into the European Economic
and Monetary Union (EMU), the semi-official Athens News Agency (
ANA)reported.
</P>
<P>
Greek Economy and Finance Minister Yiannos Papantoniou said
during the meeting that the Greek government would promote all
structural reforms needed to open up monopoly markets in energy
and telecommunications and implement its privatization programs.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that his ministry would move rapidly to
abolish all market structures hindering competition and all
bureaucratic procedures, including opening up certain state-
licensed professions.
</P>
<P>
Greece, which has made great economic achievements over the
past years thanks to the government's economic reforms policy,
lures now a growing number of foreign investors, but the country's
bureaucracy is still considered the primary cause of delays in
legal or technical procedures.
</P>
<P>
About 50 foreign companies have plans to invest in Greece
amounts totaling 5 to 6 billion drachmas (about 13.5 million to 16.
2 million U.S. dollars), but are hesitating to act because of
complex bureaucratic procedures and the extensive list of
documents required for investments or joint ventures, according to
the Greek Investment Center (GIC).
</P>
<P>
The ministry planned to strengthen the supervising role and
the function of regulatory authorities in competition, capital
markets, telecommunication and electricity, Papantoniou said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that Greece comfortably fulfilled all EMU membership
criteria, Papantoniou said that Athens is expected to formally
complete negotiations on the country's EMU membership at an
European Union (EU) summit in Lisbon, Portugal in July 19.

<HEADLINE> Netherlands Supports Municipal Administration in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands has committed to
providing 1. 6 million U.S. dollars to the project
"Capacity-building and technical support to the Municipal
Administration in Kosovo", the U.N. Centre for Human Settlements
(Habitat) said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
An agreement on the project has been signed here between Klaus
Toepfer, acting executive director of Habitat, and Gertjan Storm,
permanent representative of the Netherlands to Habitat.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N agency, the Nairobi-based Habitat is now
working with the U.N. Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo to
establish a properly functioning Municipal Administration in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the project will provide technical support
to the 30 municipalities in Kosovo and offer advice and guidance
in re- establishing the basic functions of local government.
</P>
<P>
The project will, in collaboration with the Netherlands
Association of Municipalities, strengthen the ability of
municipal governments to design and plan the development of their
cities and will also help the municipal governments generate and
manage their finances.
</P>
<P>
Habitat said the project will be implemented mainly by local
professionals with the support of a small number of international
experts.
</P>
<P>
Following the end of the conflict in Kosovo a year ago, most of
the municipal structure was destroyed and many registry offices
containing essential birth, death and property ownership
information had been decimated.
</P>
<P>
Habitat expressed the hope that with the support of the
Netherlands, the municipal administrations in Kosovo will be fully
operational and be able to take over responsibility for local
development and urban governance by October this year for the
municipal elections.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Rand Remains Vulnerable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Chen Yue
</P>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The South African currency
rand has dived almost one rand against the U.S. dollar from 5.98
rand late last September to 6.96 rand this week.
</P>
<P>
In the past eight months, the rand has depreciated by about 16
percent against the ever-strengthening dollar because of
vulnerability of the euro, whose exchange rate against dollar had
dropped from 1.07 last October to 0. 904 on Thursday, decreasing
by 13.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Nicky Veldtman, senior economist at South Africa's Nedcor
Economic Unit, said international uncertainties, combined with the
sharp withdrawal of foreign funds, have also placed substantial
pressure on the rand especially since late April.
</P>
<P>
The currency suffered along with the euro since South Africa
signed a free trade agreement with the European Union last
October.
</P>
<P>
When the Zimbabwean land crisis broke out in February, many
South African economists shared worries that the same land
invasions could probably happen in South Africa. The worries
directly influenced the stability of the rand.
</P>
<P>
In comparison with the situation in Zimbabwe where white
farmers make up only one percent of the population but own nearly
70 percent of the fertile farmland, white farmers in South Africa
own close to 90 percent of the productive farmland and the process
of redistribution has been moving at a snail's pace.
</P>
<P>
President Thabo Mbeki confessed on Wednesday at National
Assembly in Cape Town that only 0.81 percent of the 32 million
hectares of South Africa' s private commercial farmland have been
redistributed in six post-apartheid years since 1994 against a
target of 30 percent over five years.
</P>
<P>
However, Mbeki said that his government will speed up the land
reform in the country, promising to resettle about 70,000 black
commercial farmers on nearly 2 million hectares of state land over
the next 15 years. Dealers and analysts believed that Mbeki's
efforts to ease fears on land invasions in South Africa halted the
currency's slide.
</P>
<P>
"It was exactly what the markets needed to hear. It is just a
pity Mbeki didn't say this a week or so ago," said James Rheeder,
market analyst at Standard and Poor's (S&AMP;P) international credit
rate agency.
</P>
<P>
In a report released on Friday, S&AMP;P said the rand "appears
undervalued" at seven rand against the dollar because "robust
political institutions" clearly divide South Africa from Zimbabwe
although the crisis in the country is having an adverse effect on
foreign investors' sentiment about the whole Southern African
region.
</P>
<P>
The international credit rate agency also said continued
political stability in South Africa looks likely under President
Mbeki and a split between the ruling African National Congress and
its alliance partners is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
S&AMP;P's London-based South African analyst Konrad Reuss said the
Zimbabwean crisis and the plunge in the rand have not changed
South Africa' s credit rating over the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
However, he also pointed out that the "vulnerability of the
rand to periodic pressures", low foreign exchange reserves and
dependence on volatile portfolio inflows "remain a critical
constraint to South Africa's credit standing", leading to the
conclusion that the rand will continue to be vulnerable in the
future.

<HEADLINE> Habitat New Strategic Vision Wins Donor Confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The implementation of the new
strategic vision, adequate shelter for all and sustainable urban
development, by the U.N. Centre for Human Settlements (Habitat)
has led to increased donor confidence, the Habitat announced in
Kenya's capital Nairobi Friday.
</P>
<P>
Habitat said in a press release that its revitalization
endorsed by member states and other Habitat stakeholders has also
resulted in a continued upward trend in voluntary contribution
from various governments.
</P>
<P>
"With the restructuring and the implementation of its new
vision, Habitat is able to commit itself fully to the
implementation of the Habitat Agenda," said Acting Executive
Director of Habitat Klaus Toepfer.
</P>
<P>
The Habitat Agenda, which was adopted by 171 governments in
Istanbul, Turkey, in 1996, involves six main areas -- shelter,
social development and eradication of poverty, environmental
management, economic development, governance and international
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
According to Habitat's latest forecast, there is a minimum of
4 million U.S. dollars in voluntary contributions this year as
compared to 3. 6 million dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. agency noted that the continued increase in
non-earmarked funds shows the growing confidence of members states
in the process of the revitalization of the centre.
</P>
<P>
The recent voluntary contributions for this year included
100,000 dollars from India, 230,000 dollars from Italy, 572,000
dollars from Sweden and 1.1 million dollars from the United
States, Habitat said.
</P>
<P>
Habitat also forecasted that the earmarked funds for the centre
this year is in the region of 10 million dollars compared to 6.6
million dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
These include 670,000 dollars from Finland and 896,552 dollars
from Canada for the regularization of housing and property rights
program in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Other funds earmarked are: 376,000 dollars from France for the
 implementation of the Habitat Agenda in Africa; 240,000 dollars
from Sweden for the women and Habitat program; and 237,500 dollars
from Japan for the sustainable cities program, the disaster
management program and a project on land information systems for
Kenya.

<P>
NAIROBI, May 12 (Xinhua) -- A preparatory meeting for the
Special Session on Human Settlements of the U.N. Assembly
concluded here Friday with a renewed commitment to implementing
the Habitat Agenda adopted in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Habitat (U.N. Center for Human Settlements) Agenda, an
action plan to improve human settlements, was adopted by 171
governments at the second U.N. Conference on Human Settlements
held in Istanbul, Turkey. These governments are expected to review
the progress on their promise in June 2001 at the U.N. Assembly.
</P>
<P>
About 700 delegates attended the five-day meeting and
representatives of governments presented reports on their policy
changes, governance and international cooperation in order to
fulfill the Habitat Agenda.
</P>
<P>
"By renewing their commitment to the implementation of the
Habitat Agenda, this preparatory meeting has shown that the
spirit of Istanbul is alive and well," said Acting Executive
Director of the Habitat Klaus Toepfer.
</P>
<P>
Toepfer held bilateral meetings with delegations from
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from Cuba, India, Morocco and Senegal welcomed the
work that the Habitat has done in the fields of poverty
eradication and capacity building.
</P>
<P>
The two global campaigns launched by Habitat, namely Secure
Tenure and Urban Governance were also discussed at the conference.

<HEADLINE> S.Leone Government Force Repels Rebels Further away </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, Mary 12 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone government army said
Friday that after heavy fighting they had driven rebels further
back from Freetown, the country's capital.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here from Freetown quoted an government force
spokesman as saying that the fighting took place in the past days
near Newton, a town some 40 kilometers east of the capital.
</P>
<P>
British government also confirmed on Friday that its 1,000
strong task force currently stationed in Sierra Leone would not be
limited to the pre- set goal of evacuation of foreign nationals.
</P>
<P>
Though reiterating that the troop will refrain form
participating in combats, the British government said the soldiers
would offer technical and logistical support to the UN forces.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the British soldiers were seen active in manning
roadblocks at key junctions in the outskirts of the city with the
UN peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
A UN spokesman Friday also confirmed that About 200 Kenyan
peacekeepers had broken through the rebels surrounding and
returned to Freetown.
</P>
<P>
They had reportedly fought their way on Wednesday out of their
camp in Makeni, a town about 240 kilometers east of the country's
capita.
</P>
<P>
It was still not clear that whether they are among the 500 UN
personnel captured by the rebels.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wholesale Prices Fall in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. wholesale prices fell 0.3
percent in April after surging for two straight months as energy
costs took their biggest decline in nine years, more than
offsetting a jump in food prices, the Labor Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The decline in the department's Producer Price Index, which
measures inflation pressures before they reach the consumer, was
the best showing on inflation since a 0.4 percent drop posted in
February 1999.
</P>
<P>
In February and March, wholesale prices shot up by 1 percent,
the sharpest increase in nearly 10 years. In both months the jolts
came from soaring energy prices.
</P>
<P>
In April, energy prices fell by 4.1 percent, the biggest
decline since a 5 percent drop in February 1991. That followed a 5.
8 percent spike in March.
</P>
<P>
However, food prices in April shot up 1 percent, the biggest
jump since a 1.5 percent rise in January 1999, following a slim 0.
1 percent increase in March.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile energy and food categories, the "core"
rate of inflation at the wholesale level for the second month in a
row rose by just 0.1 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the report, car prices rose 0.4 percent, while
light truck prices fell 0.1 percent. Prescription drug prices went
up 0.5 percent. The prices that retail stores pay for books fell
by a record 1.7 percent, surpassing the previous 1.5 percent
record decline recorded in October 1996.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, wholesale prices have been rising at an
annual rate of 5.4 percent, compared with a 3 percent gain for all
of 1999. The pickup in this year's wholesale prices largely
reflects rising energy costs.
</P>
<P>
While the tame PPI was good news in the booming economy that
some worry faces a danger of overheating, it may not be hugely
significant for Federal Reserve policymakers, who will meet on
Tuesday to weigh another rise in U.S. interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Most economists not only expect the Fed to raise interest rates
on Tuesday but they believe the central bank could take a more
forceful monetary stance, raising interest rates by a half-
percentage point as opposed to the quarter-point moves that have
characterized its actions over the past year.
</P>
<P>
The Fed has raised interest rates five times by a quarter-point
each since June 30 to slow the supercharged economy and keep
inflation from escalating.

WASHINGTON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. businesses boosted their
inventories by 0.3 percent in March to seasonally adjusted 1,164.8
billion U.S. dollars, following a 0.5 percent increase the month
before, the Commerce Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The inventories at manufacturers, retailers and wholesalers in
March were 5.2 percent higher than that in same month of 1999.
</P>
<P>
In March, inventories of durable goods, big items which can
last at least three years such as mashing machines, increased 0.3
percent to 707.9 billion dollars. Inventories of nondurable goods
such as foods and gasoline rose 0.4 percent to 456.8 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Total business sales increased 1.2 percent in March to 889.2
billion dollars, up from a 0.4 percent increase in February. The
March sales were 9.8 percent higher than a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Sales of durable goods rose 1.2 percent in March to 453.8
billion dollars while sales of nondurable goods increased 1.1
percent to 435.4 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The total business inventories/sales ratio at the end of March
was 1.31, meaning at the sales pace in March, U.S. businesses need
1.31 months to sell out their inventories. In March 1999, the
ratio was 1.37.

<HEADLINE> Major Points of Truce Accord Between Indonesia, Aceh Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government and the
separatist Free Aceh Movement signed a cease-fire agreement in
Geneva on Friday. Following are the major points of the agreement,
called the Joint Understanding on Humanitarian Pause for Aceh.
</P>
<P>
The agreement constitutes a concrete mechanism aimed at
addressing the humanitarian dimension of the conflict in Aceh, to
reduce violence, and to settle the existing differences through
dialogue and reconciliation, the Indonesian mission in Geneva said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The agreement consists of six articles, containing objectives,
components, organizational structure, time frame, transition and
public communication of the Humanitarian Pause program. It will
come into effect on June 2. The first phase of its implementation
covers a period of three months and will be regularly reviewed for
its renewal.
</P>
<P>
For the implementation of the agreement, two joint committees
are to be established -- the Joint Committee for Humanitarian
Action and the Joint Committee on Security Modalities.
</P>
<P>
The first committee is tasked to coordinate effective delivery
of humanitarian relief assistance in a way that ensures greater
participation of and benefit to the people of Aceh. The second
committee oversees the security aspect of the agreement by
ensuring the reduction of tension and the cessation of violence.
The second committee will prepare ground rules for the conduct of
activities pertaining to the Humanitarian Pause, guarantee the
absence of offensive military actions, and ensure the continuing
of normal police function for the enforcement of law and the
maintenance of public order.
</P>
<P>
Each joint committee consists of a maximum of 10 members. The
activities of the two committees will respectively be monitored by
a monitoring team consisting of five persons of high integrity.
Both committees will be based in Banda Aceh.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a Switzerland-based joint forum, which consists of
representatives of the two sides, will also be established as the
highest decision-making body.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, Aceh Rebels Sign Cease-Fire Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government and the
rebel Free Aceh Movement Friday signed a cease-fire agreement in
Geneva, said a statement by the Indonesian mission in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which will come into effect on June 2, was
signed at a secret venue behind closed doors by Indonesia's
ambassador to UN and other international organizations in Geneva,
N. Hassan Wirajuda, and Zaini Abdullah, who represented the rebel
movement.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, called the Joint Understanding on Humanitarian
Pause, was driven by the need to address the humanitarian
dimension, particularly to decrease the human suffering as a
result of conflict in Aceh, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The accord provides for joint efforts both to increase
humanitarian relief assistance and to reduce tension and to stop
violence in the province of Aceh.
</P>
<P>
"This Joint Understanding is an early step of a hundred-step
journey in the efforts to find a final solution of the Aceh
problem," said Wirajuda.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the agreement had been a result of talks
facilitated by the Henry Dunant Center for Humanitarian Dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"If it is implemented successfully, (the agreement) could help
boost the confidence for the subsequent process," the ambassador
said. "It has also strengthened our conviction that the dialogue
and reconciliation approach, promoted by (Indonesian) President
Abdurrahman Wahid, will produce positive outcomes."
</P>
<P>
However, the rebels said their goal is still independence of
the province, which the Indonesian government has repeatedly ruled
out.

MOSCOW, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Two Russian cosmonauts on Friday
walked into space from the space station Mir for a five-hour-and-

Control Center near Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The astronauts, Sergei Zalyotin and Alexander Kaleri, opened

<HEADLINE> Building China's Silicon Valley Needs Talent and Funds: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The construction of China's silicon
valley needs a large number of talented high-tech personnel, good
market environment and ample funds, said Wu Jinglian, a Chinese
economist at the China (Beijing) International High-Tech
Industries Week 2000, that ended here today.
</P>
<P>
A wave of developing high-tech industries has recently swept
across China, with dozens of cities planning to build China's
silicon valleys.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that China has millions of professional high-tech
personnel and in some areas of the country, the density of such
personnel has surpass that in developed countries, citing Beijing'
s Zhongguancun area as an example, where there are 500,000 high-
tech personnel, a figure exceeding the 300,000 high-tech personnel
in America's Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
However, many issues remain to be tackled, including setting up
a credit system, formulating laws on protecting intellectual
property rights, opening the second board in securities market and
improving regulations on merger and acquisitions, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that China can draw some experience from Silicon Valley
in U.S., adding that he believed more silicon valleys may emerge
in China with government support.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Supreme Leader Urges Reformers, Conservatives to Come Closer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Iran's supreme leader Seyyed Ali
Khamenei on Friday urged the reformers and conservatives in the
country to come closer to each other, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"I urge these two main political wings within the system to
define new borders, reduce the line between themselves," Khamenei
told a huge crowd of worshipers at the Tehran University campus and
its nearby streets.
</P>
<P>
Despite their political backgrounds, those to the power centers
(the parliament, or the president's office, etc.) must, based on
the Islamic values, try to rescue the country from poverty,
discrimination, injustice and other weaknesses, he added.
</P>
<P>
The leader made the statement as political struggle between the
conservatives and the reformers became intense following the
landslide victory of the reformers in February's sixth parliament
election and the consequential crackdown upon them by the powerful
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Reformers allied to President Mohammad Khatami won more than two
thirds of the 290 seats in the new parliament, ending the long time
conservative control of the legislative body.
</P>
<P>
The victory, however, encountered a strong backlash from the
conservatives, who have annulled the election results in certain
constituencies, jailed a number of reformist journalists and
ordered the closure of most of the reformist papers through their
control of the election watchdog the Guardians Council (GC) and the
judiciary.
</P>
<P>
Even the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, elite forces
safeguarding the Islamic system, issued warnings to the reformist
camp, hinting that military action could be taken when necessary.
</P>
<P>
However, in such a sensitive situation, the supreme leader, who
is traditionally considered head of the conservative camp,
expressed his support for President Khatami, who has been pushing
for social and cultural reforms since he took office in 1997.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Khamenei condemned certain reformist elements
around Khatami, such as Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance
Ataollah Mohajerani, a strong advocator of press freedom.
</P>
<P>
With reformers expanding their victory in the runoff election of
the sixth parliament on May 5, the country entered a short period
of quietness. But no one can relax because nobody knows what will
come after the quietness.
</P>
<P>
Nobody knows if the conservative GC will finally approve the
election result in Tehran, the country's political center, where
reformers won 29 of the 30 seats in the constituency, and allow the
new parliament to begin work on the expected date of May 27,
analysts here said.

<HEADLINE> India's Agriculture Unlikely Harmed by Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 12 (Xinhua) -- India's agricultural output
during 1999-2000 (July 1999-June 2000) crop year will be unlikely
harmed by the serious drought which hit some parts of the country,
the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Economic Survey of 1999-2000 placed the year's foodgrain
production at below 200 million tons as compared with 203 million
tons in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The CMIE indicated that since harvesting of most crops has been
completed, much of the shortfall in output due to deficient rains
has already been factored in.
</P>
<P>
It also quoted the Ministry of Agriculture's estimates released
in March 2000, reflecting a 0.4 percent decline in foodgrain
production in 1999-2000 over the previous period.
</P>
<P>
The decline is much more at 6.7 percent for non-foodgrains,
resulting in an estimated overall decline of 3.1 percent in
agriculture production of 1999-2000 over the previous year, it
added.

</P>
<P>
He also noted that the country had displayed exemplary unity

Pokharan blasts and it was because of this unity that economic
sanctions failed to have impact on India.

The prime minister also said that even as India retains its

<HEADLINE> SADC to Raise Fish Consumption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Bian Zhuodan
</P>
<P>
LUANDA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Fishery Ministers from the member
countries of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) are
currently meeting in Angola's capital Luanda, focusing their
discussions on fishery cooperation and increasing fish
consumption.
</P>
<P>
Namibian Fishery Minister Iymbo Abraham, who attended the
meeting which was opened on Thursday, said that SADC region is
rich in fish resources but its consumption is much lower than
developed countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
He said that each southern African resident consumes only eight
 kilograms of fish every year while each Portuguese, Spanish and
Japanese consumes 31, 41 and 77 kilograms respectively.
</P>
<P>
The annual fish output of SADC states should rise from the
current 1.7 million tons to 3 million tons, he added.
</P>
<P>
When meeting with the SADC fishery ministers, Angolan President
Jose Eduardo dos Santos called on the SADC countries to do more to
improve the living conditions of their citizens by boosting fish
production and consumption.
</P>
<P>
The participants delivered their speeches at the meeting one
after another, who all stressed the importance to preserving fish
resources and preventing the ecosystem from destruction by over
fishing.
</P>
<P>
Mansa Sidibe, president of the conference, described the SADC
as a "very important element" in the world's fish production.
</P>
<P>
South African Deputy Environment and Tourism Minister Mabuda
Fhasi mentioned some problems that the SADC is facing in fishery.
</P>
<P>
He urged the SADC members to deal with the problem of
diminishing fish resources well so as to improve the people's fish
consumption.
</P>
<P>
Other ministers expressed concern over the illegal fishing by
some foreign ships in their territorial seas, saying they would
take necessary measures to protect the interests of local
fishermen.
</P>
<P>
Fishery ministers from Angola, Mozambique, Tanzania, Seychelles
also attended the meeting.

<P>
MOGADISHU, May 12 (Xinhua) -- At least five people including
three children have been killed after houses collapsed as heavy
rains and devastating floods are hitting southern Somalia which
had long been suffering from serious drought.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching the Somali capital Mogadishu indicate that
Tieglow district is the worst affected by the floods in Bakol
region where five people were killed and 52 houses were destroyed
by the rains.
</P>
<P>
According to Abdi Nur Derow (Isgow), the district commissioner
of Teiglow, the floods followed more than eight hours of heavy
rains and damaged an estimated over 1800 tons of sorghum, maize,
sugar, wheat and flour in the market place.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of families displaced by the floods in Tieglow and
Bakol regional capital of Huddor are currently scattered around
the villages outside these towns without food or shelter.
</P>
<P>
The neighboring region of Bay is not any better even though the
floods have killed no one so far.
</P>
<P>
Over 800 men from the four residential quarters of Baidoa town
have been fighting the floods which are threatening to cut off the
bridge linking Baidoa town to Huddor and Luq districts.
</P>
<P>
According to Mohamed Ali Aden Qalinleh, governor of the Bay
region, heavy rains which continued in the past 20 hours are
threatening two residential areas in the town, especially Horsed
area where the people have already started evacuating their
offspring and a little of belongings.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Qoryoley town in Lower Shabelleh region, 120
kilometers southwest of Mogadishu, indicate that the village of
Bambas has been washed away by floods after Shabelleh river burst
its banks Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the commissioner of Qoryoley district, Ali Hussein
Aliyow Ibrow, over 500 families who lived in Bambas village have
now moved to Mallayley village, which is itself among seven other
endangered villages in the region.
</P>
<P>
The local authorities have reopened the dam of Qoryoley town so
as to minimize the flow of water to those villages. However, one
question still remains to be answered: Who is going to feed those
thousands of destitute families displaced by the floods.

<HEADLINE> Russia Toughens Control of Chechen Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Russia tightened control of the
border between the breakaway republic of Chechnya and the republic
of Ingushetia after an attack on a convoy of federal troops by
Chechen rebels Thursday, said the Russian military Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Kavkaz checkpoint, the entry from Chechen into Ingushetia,
has been closed provisionally, while border posts and guards are
being reinforced, the Interfax news agency quoted the Ingush
Interior Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said Ingush President Ruslan Aushev ordered law
enforcement agencies to take strict and effective measures to
strengthen security along the borders as well as inside the
republic.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen Russian soldiers were killed on Thursday in an ambush
by Chechen rebels near the village of Galashki in Ingushetia.
This was the first time that Russian federal troops suffered such
a heavy loss outside Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The military said a search for the attackers has been fruitless
and they were believed to have returned to Chechnya immediately
after the attack.
</P>
<P>
The Russian military command warned Friday that Chechen rebels
may launch more attacks on federal troops, and the rebel forces
will swell in size as soon as the mercenaries arrive from Russia's
neighboring republics and other countries.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have changed their tactics, ambushing federal troops
only in small groups of 5 to 15 men so as to move unseen and make
their escape easier, said the Russian forces' headquarters in the
North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
According to federal military intelligence reports, the
militants are well armed with some machine guns, automatic weapons,
"Mukha" grenade-launchers and sniper rifles.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Keen to Host Thomas Cup Finals  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Eighteen years have passed
since the Thomas Cup Finals was last held in Europe, but this
could change in 2002 as the Netherlands are among the countries or
cities bidding to play host.
</P>
<P>
The stumbling block for the Dutch, or any of the other
countries or cities interested in hosting the Thomas/Uber Cups, is
that they have to first convince the International Badminton
Federation (IBF) of their financial capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Unlike this year's edition in Kuala Lumpur where sponsors
abound, it is not so easy elsewhere to obtain the 1.5-million U.S.
dollars needed to organize the tournament.
</P>
<P>
"Interested countries (or cities) will be interviewed first
before a decision is made on the hosts for the 2002 Finals," said
IBF vice-president Datuk Punch Gunalan, at Putra Stadium here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The cost factor is the main reason we are careful in selecting
the hosts. They have to convince us they have the funds."
</P>
<P>
The last European city to host the Thomas Cup was London in
1982. Since then, the Thomas Cup has been as Asian affair.
</P>
<P>
Besides this year, Kuala Lumpur played hosts in 1984, 1988,
1992 while the 1986 and 1994 editions were held in Jakarta,
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo played hosts in 1990 while the last two Finals were in
Hong Kong, China.
</P>
<P>
IBF, who will hold their annual meeting this Sunday, will
discuss the 2002 job and Gunalan said a decision is expected by
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
This edition, however, is definite to be a commercial success
and the number of advertisement boards in the stadium is testimony
to that.
</P>
<P>
Ticket sales have also been encouraging with Malaysia's three
group matches registering 80 per cent of sales.
</P>
<P>
Ticket sales for the other days have been promising as well.

<HEADLINE> China Urged to Expand E-Commerce (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- China ought to take measures to
catch up with developed countries in E-commerce, said
entrepreneurs and experts attending the ongoing International High-
Tech Industries Week in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Development of E-commerce is based on a comprehensive trade,
storage and distribution system, said Dr. Dongping Zhu, president
of the Zaptron digit research company in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
"It is not a castle in the air," said Zhu, a graduate of
Virginia Tech in the United States.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, China's Internet surfers had exceeded
8.9 million, but few of them ever tried to purchase goods over the
net. And most of Chinese on-line shoppers are aged between 20 and
35 with college degrees, said Dr. Xiaoying Chen, an E-commerce
specialist at Japan's Softbank Publishing Inc..
</P>
<P>
In contrast, at least 40 percent of Japan's 30 million Internet
surfers have experience in on-line shopping, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
"Even elderly women and high school students in Japan would use
their mobile phones to surf the internet for shopping," she said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, the United States had more than 100 million
Internet users, and 70 percent of them ordered commercials via the
net.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Americans ordered nine billion US dollars
worth of gifts during 1999 Christmas on the net, known as "E-
Christmas."
</P>
<P>
Personal computers, auto spare parts and books do brisk trading
on the internet in developed countries. "E-commerce has shortened
the distance between the manufacturers and consumers," she said. (

<HEADLINE> NASDAQ Official Dismisses Pessimism about Internet Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- A NASDAQ official has said here
that the widespread pessimism about the Internet economy is
unnecessary and the plunging price in technological stocks is only
a result of normal market correction.
</P>
<P>
Huang Huaguo, chief representative of National Association of
Securities Dealers Automatic Quotation (NASDAQ) China Office,
dismissed the pessimism about the Internet Economy at a forum on
international fund-raising, saying that the impact of the plunging
technology stock prices will gradually diminish like waves
produced by a stone thrown into a lake. However, the prospects of
the Internet Economy will be promising just as "the scenery around
the lake will grow even more beautiful".
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the NASDAQ index will climb back to over 4,
000 points at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
While NASDAQ only represents one third of the American capital
market, Huang said, it has nurtured quite a number of small
enterprises helping them grow into world-renowned multinationals.
</P>
<P>
Companies listed at NASDAQ provide about one out of every six
job opportunities in the United States, Huang added.
</P>
<P>
Huang also revealed that NASDAQ's ambition is to expand into a
global market and link all major financial markets worldwide by
joining hands with financial markets in Japan, Europe and Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
He added that NASDAQ-Hong Kong will also be launched at the end
of the month, making it possible for investors to trade NASDAQ
stocks at the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. "The launch of NASDAQ-
China is also foreseeable in the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen Fan, president of the Bank of China International (Asia)
Co. Ltd, echoed Huang's view, saying that the integration of
capital and economic entities with information space will
eventually result in great power and the growth of an Internet
economy is already an irreversible trend globally.

<HEADLINE> Wu Jinglian on Government's Role in Building China's Silicon Valley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- China may have more than one
silicon valley if the government encourages and builds its talent
market instead of only issuing policies, said Wu Jinglian today,
an economist and researcher with the Development Research Center
under the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remark in a speech titled "How can China have its
own silicon valley?" at a forum at the China (Beijing)
International High-Tech Industries Week 2000, which closed today.
</P>
<P>
Famous specialists were invited to give suggestions on China's
high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that the government-dominated economy system was once
established in Japan and South Korea after the 1997 financial
crisis in Southeast Asia, but was proven inappropriate for the new
economic situation. China should learn from these examples, he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, the core task for the government is to help
establish so-called a knowledge economy and set up related rules.
</P>
<P>
Wu suggested, among other things, that the government should
maintain a healthy environment for enterprises and professional
personnel, strengthen lawmaking in related fields by using and
managing venture capital, and funding fundamental research.
</P>
<P>
So far, around ten Chinese cities including Beijing, Shanghai,
Tianjin, and Shenzhen, plan to construct information technology-
based special development zones similar to Silicon Valley in the U.
S.

In China, few stores have gained profits from E-commerce due to

Incomplete credit card systems and high telecommunications

Mackarl Enterprises Inc. of the United States. Zhang is a graduate
of the University of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
Enhanced protection of intellectual property rights, training
of more professionals, and developing interesting websites for

said.

<P>
The Chinese-born experts and entrepreneurs gathered at a forum
during High-tech week.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Weidong Wang, an E-commerce adviser at Sidley &AMP; Austin law
office in Chicago, called for the lowered taxation for E-commerce
sellers.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation acknowledged that there are problems hindering the
expansion of E-commerce.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Rebound of Steel Prices Not to Fuel Production: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The recent rebound of steel prices
in China will not prompt the country to increase steel production,
a senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Shan Yihe, vice director of the State Administration of
Metallurgical Industry (SAMI), attributed the price hike mainly to
the reduction of suppliers, China's policy of controlling steel
production, and the increase of domestic demand, thanks to the
country's sustained economic growth and its strategy to develop
China's western areas.
</P>
<P>
"The price level is quite reasonable at present, but the speed
of rebounding is a bit too fast," he added.
</P>
<P>
Prices of steel products for construction use have been
declining since 1993 due to oversupply. The average per-ton price
is less than 2,000 yuan last year, 1,100 yuan lower than the 1993
level.
</P>
<P>
This April saw substantial price increases, with wholesale
prices amounting to about 2,500 yuan and retail prices in some
areas hitting 2,800 yuan. These prices spurred many steel
producers to consider increasing their production.
</P>
<P>
Shan warned steel producers and companies of a recurrence of
oversupply and urged them to take an objective look at the market.
</P>
<P>
No administrative measures, however, will be taken by the
government to force them to control production, he noted.
</P>
<P>
A large amount of steel products in China are oversupplied and
have suffered falling prices, which prompted the country to cut
steel production and eliminate obsolete production capacities.
</P>
<P>
This year, 103 small steel mills will be closed and production
capacity of 4.5 million tons will be cut.

<HEADLINE> China Improves Environment for Enterprise Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Efforts made by the Chinese
government in creating a preferential environment for enterprise
management created enormous interest among delegates at the U.S.
Asia Society's 11th Annual Corporate Conference.
</P>
<P>
Yu Xiaosong, chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of
International Trade, said in a keynote speech at today's meeting
that "the Chinese government has and will continue to adopt
resolute measures to free State-owned enterprises (SOEs) from the
control of specific economic departments and expand their
operation to broader areas."
</P>
<P>
The government economic administrative departments will be
further streamlined, and the independent management of enterprises
will be guaranteed, he added.
</P>
<P>
An official from the State Economic and Trade Commission said
that the target of future reforms will be "smaller government and
better service", converting government administration into
services and pushing enterprises into the market.
</P>
<P>
Chinese governments at all levels are making concerted efforts
to alleviate the debt burden of enterprises, mainly by converting
bank's non-performing assets to equities, and issuing bonds and
stock shares to increase enterprises capital fund.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Economic Commission of Shanghai, Huang Qifan,
said at today's round-table meeting that by listing shares on the
stock market, mergers, land replacement and other asset
restructuring measures, Shanghai has reduced the rate of loss-
making SOEs from 40 percent to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said that by injecting capital and readjusting the structure
of products, the city's industries have maintained a stable growth
rate at about 12 percent annually in recent years. The growth rate
of new and high-tech industries is as high as 30 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
"Now 90 percent of Shanghai's SOEs have established a modern
enterprise system," he added.
</P>
<P>
Experts at the meeting held that, by promoting the development
of the capital market, establishing a social insurance system,
improving the legal framework and speeding up the development of
service industries, China is on the right track for creating an
even better environment for enterprise management.

<HEADLINE> China has Long Way to Go in Reforming Government Institutions: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- China has made great advancement in
reforming its government institutions, but the task is far from
complete, a senior Chinese official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The reform of government institutions is a gradual process in
economic and social development, said Xu Rongkai, deputy secretary-
general of the State Council, at the opening ceremony of an
international conference on public policy and management.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, China has adopted a series of measures to reform
government institutions above the county level, including the
separation of government functions from enterprise management,
downsizing of staff and improving efficiency, he said.
</P>
<P>
The biggest reform started from early 1998, when the number of
ministry-level departments under the State Council was cut from 40
to 29. Organs under the ministries were cut by a quarter, with a
50 percent cut in staff, a move that indicates the completion of
restructuring of the State Council itself.
</P>
<P>
The reform process has extended to local governments of all
levels this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, a lot of issues remain to be tackled, including how to
supervise the government effectively, how to prevent government
employees from abusing their power, and how to completely separate
government functions from enterprise management, he said.
</P>
<P>
The successful reform of government institutions also need a
large number of civil servants and qualified public organ
management personnel to meet the demand of the market economy, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, China needs to actively carry out public management
education, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Abu Sayyaf Refuses to Free Two Sick Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The hostages, mostly foreigners, have been moved by the Abu
Sayyaf rebels to a new "safe place" much further in the jungle of
the Jolo island in the southern Philippines, the nation's leading
news channel ABS-CBN said.
</P>
<P>
The military's approach to the hostages' hideout on Thursday
may be the major factor to scare away representatives of the rebel
group, who had agreed to appear before government negotiators
Thursday, the ABS-CBN said.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Abu Sayyaf asked for 24 hours before they can
decide whether to release a sick German woman and a ailing French
man.They also promised a reply by Thursday, but government
negotiators confirmed Thursday that they have lost contact with
the Abu Sayyaf group again.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government expressed confidence Friday that
there will be less chances of miscues in rescue efforts for the
safe release of the 21 tourists abducted from Malaysia on April 23.
</P>
<P>
Press Secretary and Presidential Spokesman Ricardo Puno was
quoted as saying by Philippine News Agency that the military is
taking steps not to repeat Thursday's miscommunication that
stalled the release of two ailing hostages.
</P>
<P>
"It was unfortunate but the orders that were disseminated got
into some problems. But as of today (Friday) I understand the
military was able to make it very clear that the military will not
be moving in the various areas where the Abu Sayyaf may also be
moving," Puno said.
</P>
<P>
He also said government negotiators led by Governor Nur Misuari
of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) have managed to
reestablish contact with the hostage takers as of Friday.
</P>
<P>
With better coordination from the military, he added, the
government stands a better chance of ensuring the hostages' safe
release.

<HEADLINE> Court Asks Pak Military Govt to Step Down in 3 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The court said the military government led by General Pervez
Musharraf should "complete its agenda" within three years starting
from October 12, 1999, and hold elections within 90 days after the
passage of three years.
</P>
<P>
The apex court bench composed of twelve judges Friday justified
the military coup, describing it as "an act of necessity", and
disposed of all petitions challenging it.
</P>
<P>
The bench has been hearing the case from May 1 on a day-to-day
basis, unanimously announced the judgment in a short order.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani army led by General Pervez Musharraf dismissed

<HEADLINE> Ghana Calls for Compromise for Peace in Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian President Jerry John
Rawlings has called on Israelis and Palestinians to make the
necessary compromises to achieve peace in the Middle East, saying
this is the best opportunity to bring to an end years of conflict
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Ghana News Agency Friday quoted Rawlings as saying that
Israelis and Palestinians had an opportunity to achieve peace a
few years ago, but this was lost following the assassination of
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
"A unique opportunity has presented itself again and it should
not be lost," Rawlings made the remarks when he received Naomi
Chazan, deputy speaker of the Knesset (Israeli Parliament), on
Thursday in Ghana's capital Accra.
</P>
<P>
Chazan briefed Rawlings on current Middle East negotiations and
 Israeli proposals to withdraw from some of the occupied
territories including south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Rawlings called for compromises from both sides and said he
believes there are many Israelis and Arabs who are desirous to
co-exist peacefully.
</P>
<P>
He, however, warned that there are interested parties who would
want peace to be achieved "on their terms" and these might not be
in the interest of both parties.

<HEADLINE> EU Concerned About Renewed Ethiopia-Eritrea Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) on Friday
expressed its concern about the renewed conflict between Ethiopia
and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
"The EU is concerned about the situation in Ethiopia and
Eritrea where the union is conducting humanitarian assistance with
other non-governmental organizations," said a spokesman of the
European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the EU is still able to conduct the aid
program in the parts of Ethiopia where the renewed conflict did
not affect.
</P>
<P>
A two-year-old war between the two countries on the horn of
Africa broke out again on Friday with heavy fighting along their
border.
</P>
<P>
Both Ethiopia and Eritrea have been suffering from drought and
famine, and United Nations relief agencies say millions of people
are threatened with famine in Ethiopia alone.
</P>
<P>
Satellite images and field trips helped international observers
estimate the Ethiopian food shortage at 821,000 tons this year.
</P>
<P>
So far, total donor pledges are over 800,000 tons, of which the
EU pledged to provide more than half. The EU food aid to arrive in
Ethiopia in 2000 totals 432,526 tons, according to commission
officials.
</P>
<P>
Of the amount, 282,526 tons are being offloaded, shipped or
procured with the remaining 150,000 tons in the process of being
allocated.
</P>
<P>
From all donors, total shipments of food aid expected to arrive
in Ethiopia between now and July is 504,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The EU food aid will be channeled to three relief programs, the
non-governmental organizations, the World Food Program and the
Ethiopian government, commission officials added.
</P>
<P>
Despite international efforts, food rations per head per month
in Ethiopia is only six kilograms as against the targeted 12.5
kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The EU has been a major supplier of food aid to Ethiopia in the
past 25 years, during which period 38 percent of all EU aid to
Ethiopia has been used for food aid activities.
</P>
<P>
Over the past four years alone, 250 million euros (240 million
U.S. dollars) have been spent on food aid for Ethiopia.

</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>

legislation that would dramatically expand the amount of money set
aside annually for conservation and land purchases, a rare example
of Republicans and Democrats coming together on environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
-- UN troops and government forces of Sierra Leone engaged in
heavy fighting Thursday with rebels approaching the capital,
Freetown, apparently halting the rebel advance.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- In pointed questions to lawyers for both sides in the battle
over the future of Elian Gonzalez, three U.S. federal judges
wondered on Thursday how a six-year-old boy who cannot even sign
his full name could apply for political asylum but questioned
whether sending him back to Cuba was in his best interests,
regardless of his father's fitness as a parent.
</P>
<P>
-- Five pharmaceutical companies Thursday offered to negotiate
steep cuts in the price of AIDS drugs for Africa and other poor
regions afflicted by the disease. The announcement of negotiations,
to be held with the World Health Organization and other
international aid groups, was made in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. retail sales unexpectedly declined 0.2 percent in April,
their first retreat since August 1998. Prices for imported goods
fell 1.6 percent in April as oil prices eased, providing some
inflation relief.
</P>
<P>
-- New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Thursday that he hasn't
decided whether to abandon his U.S. Senate race amid speculation
over the Republicans' fallback strategy against Hillary Rodham
Clinton. Giuliani recently announced plans to separate from his

<HEADLINE> Russian Reporter, Policemen Killed in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 12 (Xinhua) -- A Russian journalist and two federal
police officers were killed in the breakaway republic of Chechnya
on Friday when their vehicle was ambushed by rebels, said the
Russian military command in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Yefremov, reporter for the Nashe Vremya (Our Times)
newspaper based in the Russian Siberia city of Tyumen, and the two
policemen were shot dead while their vehicle, traveling along the
Alkhan-Kala-Grozny road, came under fire during a rebel ambush,
the Russian military command in Chechnya was quoted by the
Interfax news agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
"All of the three persons were killed -- two police officers
and the journalist Yefremov. This happened in the vicinity of the
village of Kirov, which is four kilometers from Grozny," said the
command.
</P>
<P>
The military said Friday that Chechen rebels may have changed
their tactics, ambushing federal troops only in small groups so as
to move unseen and make their escape easier.
</P>
<P>
In the republic of Ingushetia, which borders Chechnya, 19
Russian servicemen were killed on Thursday when their convoy was
attacked by rebels.
</P>
<P>
The military command also warned on Friday that Chechen rebels
may intensify their fighting against federal troops and the rebel
forces will swell in size as soon as the mercenaries arrive from
Russia's neighboring republics and other countries.
</P>
<P>
Scattered rebel groups, which have managed to restore their
lines of communication and command, have set up a network of
agents in the Chechen regions controlled by federal troops, said
the Russian forces' headquarters in the North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
At least 53 people died in clashes between Russian federal
troops and rebels in Chechnya on Thursday, reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Over 30 rebels and two Russian Interior Ministry soldiers were
shot dead in fighting outside the Chechen village of Serzhen-Yurt
on Thursday, with another four federal servicemen wounded, said
Interfax.
</P>
<P>
The band of more than 30 rebels were ambushed by an Interior
Ministry reconnaissance unit near the village, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Another federal reconnaissance unit killed 21 rebels at their
base on a deserted sheep farm near the village of Niki-Khita in
south Chechnya. Two Russian servicemen were injured in the
fighting, the Itar-Tass news agency quoted the Russian forces'
press center in the North Caucasus as saying.

<HEADLINE> China: From Potential Market to Source of Stability (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 12 (Xinhua) -- At the 11th annual corporate
conference of US Asia Society that just ended in Shanghai today,
senior officials of the Republic of Korea (ROK), Thailand and
Vietnam and CEOs of different multinationals said their respective
countries and businesses have weathered the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
China's stabilizing role in the Asian financial crisis has made
them conclude that China not only has a huge market potential, but
also is a source of stability.
</P>
<P>
ROK, which was worst hit in the Asian financial crisis, expects
a growth rate of more than six percent in gross domestic product (
GDP) this year. Last year ROK's GDP grew 10.7 percent on an annual
basis.
</P>
<P>
Lee Hun-Jai, minister of finance and economy of ROK, said in a
speech made at the three-day conference that China has played a
very crucial role in curbing the worsening of the Asian financial
crisis and helping those economies affected by the crisis quickly
recover by not devaluating the official currency, yuan.
</P>
<P>
Nguyen Manh Cam, deputy prime minister of Vietnam, also spoke
highly of China's stabilizing role in the financial crisis. China
will surely be well adapted to international economic rules and
regulations, be able to participate in global and regional
economic cooperation and exert a positive impact after it becomes
a WTO member.
</P>
<P>
During the Asian financial crisis, China persisted in
stabilizing its currency and exchange rate. Consequently, exports
fell in varying degrees over a two-year period. The recovery of
economy in other Asian countries spurred China's exports.
</P>
<P>
China's continued economic growth and huge market have created
chances of investment for many multinationals which also consider
China as a safe place to make investment.

<HEADLINE> Fundamental Factors for Building China's Silicon Valley : Expert </HEADLINE>

<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Talent, a liberal business
environment and abundant funding are the three basic factors for
China's silicon valley, a senior Chinese economist said here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wu Jinglian, a veteran researcher at the Development Research
Center under the State Council, made the remarks in a speech at
China Beijing International High-Tech Industries Week Forum, which
finished today.
</P>
<P>
About ten Chinese cities plan to build special development
zones similar to the Silicon Valley in the United States, and the
Zhongguancun High-Tech Zone in Beijing is the most promising among
them.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that compared with the Silicon Valley, Zhongguancun
needs to do a lot more work even though there are plenty of high-
tech professionals working there.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, it is an urgent task for the government to
create a good environment for those who want to start their own
business and obtain needed investment. It is also imperative to
strengthen research and theoretical studies.

<HEADLINE> Traditional Industries Combined with E-Commerce will Start New Economy: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 12 (Xinhua) -- China will kick off its new
economy only after its traditional industries turn to E-commerce,
Chinese network talents said at the U.S. Asia Society's 11th
Annual Corporate Conference.
</P>
<P>
"If the two sectors successfully merge together, there will be
no limit to China's next round of economic development," said Jack
Ma, chairman of the Alibaba.com Hong Kong Ltd.
</P>
<P>
He said that with the approaching entry into the World Trade
Organization, China needs to sharpen it competitive edge in
economic globalization by introducing a new concept and a new mode
of economic development. Combining traditional industries with E-
commerce is the best mode available.
</P>
<P>
China ranks 7th in the world in terms of economic volume, but
its labor-intensive traditional industries are not competitive in
the world market. However, China's network market has developed
rapidly, with a prospect of becoming the world's largest network
market by 2002.
</P>
<P>
If traditional industries turn to the Net for information,
technology and sales outlets, that will create one of the largest
E-commerce markets in the world, said John Wang, chairman of the
Beijing Everest E-Commerce and Network Service Co. Ltd.

<HEADLINE> Major Changes Predicted in China's Education (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Historic changes are expected to
appear in China's education system early next century, according
to the latest issue of the country's most authoritative news
weekly "Outlook".
</P>
<P>
The May 15th issue of the magazine, to hit newsstands next
Monday, noted that China's educational reform and development have
already entered a new stage.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, China has held three national conferences on
education. The first two focused on the restructuring of the
educational system and the blueprint of its development. The third
one, which was held last June, was devoted largely to deepening
reforms and promoting quality education.
</P>
<P>
"A third round of historic changes in China's education is
brewing, following the establishment of "new schools" in the early
1900s and the establishment of a new educational system when New
China was founded in 1949,", says the magazine.
</P>
<P>
The China Education Blueprint, the first of its kind in China,
will provide some notable analysis and predictions on the country'
s educational development and reforms in the next decade, the
article says.
</P>
<P>
According to the blueprint which will be made public soon, over
95 percent of the Chinese population will enjoy the nine-year
compulsory education by 2010 and about 95 percent of illiterate
young people will be able to read and write.

<P>
With a huge market, China, whose economy has been growing
steadily, has become a good place for many multinationals to stay
away from the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Over 275 Japanese businesses were surveyed in China in 1999 and
showed the number of businesses rose by 10 percent in 1998 and
will increase 75 percent this year. Seventy percent of the
businesses believe that this year's profits will be better than
last year.
</P>
<P>
C.D. Tam, deputy president of the US Motorola Co., disclosed
that in the past two years, sales of his company in China have
continued to rise, accounting for 10 percent of the company's
global sales of 33 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
His company is planning to launch a new semiconductor project
in China with a combined investment of 1.9 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
"We are no longer satisfied with sharing a bit of China's
market, but consider China as an important foundation for Motorola
's global operations," said Tam, "Because we will feel safer and
enterprising here."
</P>
<P>
W. Wayne Booker, vice chairman of the directors' board of the
US Ford Company, said signs show that the Chinese Government
understands the importance of practicing efficient rules on entry
into WTO, which is very important to multinationals' long-term
development in China.
</P>
<P>
Richard Tam with Hong Kong Trade Development Council said he is
confident that legal construction and transparency of government
work in China will be improved, in addition to lowered tariffs,
greater access to Chinese market for overseas companies after
China is admitted into the world trade body.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese economy has changed from a regional powerhouse
into an economy with global competitiveness," said Richard Tam,
adding that he, like many other overseas investors, hopes China
can be admitted into the global economy as early as possible.

<HEADLINE> Military Map in South Lebanon Outlined Pending Israeli Pullback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli military sources anticipated
clashes between the Israeli forces and the Lebanese resistance led
by Hezbollah before Israel's pullout from south Lebanon scheduled
by July.
</P>
<P>
Reports released by the London-based Strategic Institute set the
military map of the warring sides in south Lebanon before the
planned Israel withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Israel deploys 1,500 troops in south
Lebanon with tanks and armoured vehicles, stationed in military
camps in Marjiayoun, Ibil El-Saqy plain, Baiadha, Shihin and
Shabaa.
</P>
<P>
With the assistance of the South Lebanon Army (SLA), they
control strategic locations in about 20 hills such as Basim,
Bersheit and Sujid.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli forces built helicopter tarmacs in the occupied
border strip and often use its advanced Cobra and Apachi
helicopters, both equipped with TOW rockets, rocket-propelled
grenades and machine-guns, in raids on guerrilla targets.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli paratroop battalion was also stationed in the region,
who, together with the crews of tanks and armored vehicles,
suffered the bulk of the Israeli casualties in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli forces brought to the occupied border strip mine-
sweepers and United States-made tanks to detect the land mines
planted by Lebanese guerrillas in the area.
</P>
<P>
On the resistance side, Hezbollah force is made up of 3,500
fighters and 3,000 supporting elements in various parts of Lebanon
especially in Balbaak.
</P>
<P>
Most of Hezbollah weapons are light- and medium-size type as the
guerrillas are always on the move and need mobile weapons.
</P>
<P>
They also have mortars of 81mm, 82mm and 120mm calibre in
addition to a number of 107mm and 122mm launchers.
</P>
<P>
Most of the heavy armament of Hezbollah are stationed in the
Bekaa valley. It has no standing bases in the occupied south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah fighters have recently acquired 43-kilometer-range
Katyusha rockets, a modified version of the previous 25-kilometer-
range type.
</P>
<P>
A Hezbollah official announced recently that his fighters will
continue fighting until the last Israeli soldier leaves south
Lebanon. Lebanese military sources expect an Israeli pullout under
the cover of warplanes and heavy artillery shelling.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Vietnamese PM's Visit Boosts Viet-Thai Cooperation by Yang Qingchuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese prime minister Phan Van
Khai's four-day visit to Thailand, which ended up Friday morning,
has promoted the relations and cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Phan and his Thai counterpart Chuan Leekpai
witnessed the signing of an agreement to waive entry visa
requirements for Thai and Vietnamese citizens visiting each others
' countries.
</P>
<P>
Phan and Chuan believed that this move is expected to promote
tourism and encourage business activities between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Phan agreed with Chuan that there should be a closer
cooperation on rice trade as Thailand and Vietnam accounted for
nearly 50 percent of world's rice exports.
</P>
<P>
The two premiers also agreed that bilateral trade this year
should reach at least 1 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's investment in Vietnam has slowed down since the 1997
economic downturn and Phan said he would like to see Thai
businessmen return to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Phan thanked Thailand for granting residency
and nationality to former Vietnamese refugees who fled their homes
in the late 1940s.
</P>
<P>
Phan also had an audience with the King of Thailand during his
visit.
</P>
<P>
Phan is the third Vietnamese premier to make an official visit
to Thailand since the two countries established diplomatic
relations in 1976, after the end of the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
For Phan, a major task of his visit is to attract Thai
investment to his country.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is now the 11th biggest investor in Vietnam with 116
projects and a total investment capital of 1.06 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to Thai businessmen, Phan expressed appreciation
for Thailand's investment in his country and assured local
businessmen his government was committed to continuing economic
reforms and creating an improved investment climate.
</P>
<P>
After Phan's visit, the two countries, both members of the 10-
member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), are set to
sign agreements on sports cooperation as well as a memorandum of
understanding on expanding trade and investment cooperation
</P>
<P>
Phan's visit to Thailand comes at a high point in bilateral
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said that following the end of the Cambodian
conflict, Thai-Vietnamese relations had been improved quickly.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Since Vietnam joined ASEAN in 1995, the relations
between Vietnam and other ASEAN members including Thailand are
developing smoothly and fast.
</P>
<P>
Phan, 66, who held his current post since September 1997, had
visited Thailand in February to attend the first informal summit
between ASEAN and UN officials during an international meeting
held here.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 12 (Xinhua) -- At least 53 people died in clashes
between Russian federal troops and rebels in the breakaway
republic of Chechnya on Thursday, Russian news agencies reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Over 30 rebels and two Russian Interior Ministry soldiers were
shot dead in fighting outside the Chechen village of Serzhen-Yurt
on Thursday, with another four federal servicemen wounded, said
the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
The band of more than 30 rebels were ambushed by an Interior
Ministry reconnaissance unit near the village, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Another federal reconnaissance unit killed 21 rebels at their
base on a deserted sheep farm near the village of Niki-Khita in
south Chechnya. Two Russian servicemen were injured in the
fighting, the Itar-Tass news agency quoted the Russian federal
forces' press center in the North Caucasus as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the republic of Ingushetia, which borders Chechnya, 19
Russian servicemen were killed on Thursday when their convoy was
attacked by rebels, according to the Russian military.
</P>
<P>
The military command warned on Friday that Chechen rebels may
intensify their fighting against federal troops and the rebel
forces will swell in size as soon as the mercenaries arrive from
Russia's neighboring republics and other countries.
</P>
<P>
Scattered rebel groups, which have managed to restore their
lines of communication and command, have set up a network of
agents in the Chechen regions controlled by federal troops, said
the Russian forces' headquarters in the North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have changed their tactics, ambushing federal troops
only in small groups of 5-15 men so as to move unseen and make
their escape easier, said the military.
</P>
<P>
According to federal military intelligence reports, the
militants are armed with some machine guns, automatic weapons, "
Mukha" grenade-launchers and sniper rifles.

com, were hit by hackers this February, resulting in economic
losses of 1.2 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Experts said a lack of moral education in schools has seen a
rapid increase of teenager hackers in recent years. They simply

"Paying no attention or just looking down upon the importance

humanities and social sciences development will bring about mutual
benefit and push forward social development.

Also, humanities and social sciences development will allow

<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Humanities and social sciences
should be given more attention around the world to push the
development of a knowledge economy, said Li Wenhai, president of
the People's University of China, at the Presidents of World
Prestigious Universities Forum.
</P>
<P>
Li made these comments today at the International High-tech
Industries Week in Beijing. He stressed that knowledge economy is
composed of technological development and humanities and social
sciences.
</P>
<P>
During the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), China excelled in the
fields of natural sciences, production technology and economic
development. The Industrial Revolution first took place in Europe,
not only because of abundant scientists and engineers in that
continent but also thanks to the Renaissance and revolutions in
social thinking, said Li.
</P>
<P>
Li Yining, a well-known Chinese economist and also a professor
of Beijing University, said that the new economy era asks college
students to be creative and express new ideas.
</P>
<P>
Natural science and technological innovation may either benefit
or bring disasters to human beings depending on how people use
them. Nuclear power is a good example. It can either destroy a
whole country, or it can generate heating power or electricity for
the whole world.

<HEADLINE> China to Close Illegal Cotton Spinning Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- China will take measures to shut
down a group of new and illegal cotton spinning enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises are using obsolete machines to blindly
increase their cotton spinning ability, according to a press
conference held by the State Textile Industry Bureau (STIB) today.
</P>
<P>
China has eliminated more than nine million out-of-date
spindles over the past two years, controlling its cotton spinning
ability effectively while improving product quality.
</P>
<P>
However, a batch of new enterprises were set up recently, some
of which are using shabby machines, the source said.
</P>
<P>
This seriously disturbs industrial policies and jeopardizes
profits, authorities noted.
</P>
<P>
The STIB has called for efforts to speed up enterprise reform
and improve management on the basis of technical and industrial
upgrading.

<HEADLINE> Digital Divide Presents Challenges, Opportunities: Sony President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"There is a great chance for today's winner to become tomorrow'
s loser and the opposite is equally true," Nobuyuki Idei,
president and CEO of Sony Corporation, said at a luncheon given by
the Asia Society Hong Kong Center and Hong Kong Japanese Chamber
of Commerce and Industry.
</P>
<P>
"As dinosaurs become extinct when a meteorite hit the earth 65
million years ago, a meteorite called the Internet is causing
drastic changes to our environment," Idei said in his speech with
a theme of the "digital divide: winners and losers in the network
era."
</P>
<P>
This change in the environment presents opportunities for a new
world order to arise and take over the old, just like the mammals
did after the extinction of the dinosaurs, he said.
</P>
<P>
As CEO of one of the world's largest and best known consumer
electronic companies, Idei has outlined a bold vision of the
future in which electronic toys and tools converge.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Idei introduced a series of innovative networked
products, and announced a reorganization of the Sony Corporation
to focus on home networking, seeking to create a "smart-home"
whereby all entertainment systems, applications and gadgets are
linked to a central area in the home.
</P>
<P>
"As we move into the 21st century, we will experience yet
another shock caused by a second meteorite called 'broadband
network'," Idei noted.
</P>
<P>
Home network, mobile network and public network will all become
broadband within the next five to ten years or even sooner,
allowing individuals to get whatever they want instantaneously, he
said.
</P>
<P>
With the broadband network, the winners of the narrowband era,
the dotcom companies and even personal computers will be replaced
by a new world order, Idei said, adding that PC may lose its
dominance as people begin to use more user-friendly non-PC devices
to access the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Although PC-based e-commerce has been led by the United States,
Asia and Europe have advantage over the United States in the non-
PC network devices such as game consoles and mobile Internet
devices, Idei said.
</P>
<P>
"In a business environment, we have seen many rule breakers,"
he stressed. Despite the emergence of new players, established
entities in fact have an advantage over the new, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is important for established entities to transform
themselves, not only to survive but to take advantage of the new
environment by combining their real and cyber assets, Idei said.
As a result, Sony announced its vision and goal to develop a Sony
Dream World in March this year.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to become a leading broadband network
entertainment company by offering our products and services to 100
million customers around the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Digital divide was first mentioned by the U.S. government in
1997, but it seems that ever since U.S. President Bill Clinton
spoke on the issue last year, digital divide has become a buzz
word in Japan as well.
</P>
<P>
Former Prime Minister of Japan Keizo Obuchi spoke about his
hope to discuss digital divide at this year's summit, and it was a
subject of discussion at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's fair to say that digital divide has now grown
into an international concern," Idei concluded.

<HEADLINE> Senior CPC Official Meets WCL Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Wei Jianxing, a standing committee
member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC), met with a delegation of the World
Confederation of Labor (WCL) headed by its general secretary Willy
Thys, today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Wei, who is also a member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central
Committee and president of the All-China Federation of Trade
Unions, extended a warm welcome to the delegation and gave a brief
account of the tremendous achievements China made in its 20 years
of reforms.
</P>
<P>
Wei said under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with
Jiang Zemin at the core, China has taken a series of measures to
overcome the effects and difficulties inflicted by the Asian
financial crisis, and registered a relatively rapid growth in its
national economy. The reform of the State-owned enterprises, in
particular, has recorded major progress. People's life quality has
been constantly upgraded and social stability has been maintained,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Wei also briefed the delegation on the situation of China's
trade unions, stressing the Chinese trade unions are willing to
develop cooperation with the WCL and trade unions around the world
based on the principle of independence, equality, mutual respect,
and non-interference in each other's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
William Thys said during the current visit, the delegation has
learned that Chinese trade unions serve to protect the rights and
interests of ordinary laborers. Amidst economic globalization,
trade unions around the world should respect each other and
tighten cooperation. And workers of all countries should unite, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that contacts between the WCL and
Chinese trade unions would be reinforced.
</P>
<P>
The delegation is visiting China at the invitation of the All-
China Federation of Trade Unions.

<HEADLINE> Fair Reporting on China's Progress in Human Rights and Religious Freedom Needed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- A television preacher from the
United States today praised China's progress in human rights and
religious freedom, denouncing some reports on China as "distorted
and unbalanced."
</P>
<P>
"Many Americans and other peoples around the world have a
distorted and an unbalanced view of China from the reporting on
Chinese progress in human rights and religious freedom," Paul
Crouch, president of the U.S.-based Trinity Broadcasting Network (
TBN), said this afternoon at a news briefing with the local press.
</P>
<P>
Crouch, who preached in churches in Beijing and Shanghai in his
previous visit to China years ago, said he has personally seen
that Christians can openly practice and profess their faith in
China, adding that the Bible is publicly printed and freely
distributed.
</P>
<P>
Crouch, who is here at the invitation of the China Association
for International Friendly Contact, a Chinese non-governmental
organization, met previously with Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen
and other officials from China's State Administration of Religious
Affairs, the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television,
and the Information Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Crouch has used the Internet to obtain information on the Falun
Gong cult, and said he does not believe that Falun Gong is a faith,
and it is detrimental to people's health.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government's reaction to dealing with the Falun
Gong cult has been inaccurately portrayed as the government
practicing religious oppression, and in fact the government is
attempting to protect its citizens from this deadly and dangerous
Jim Jones-like cult, he said.
</P>
<P>
China could also have accused the United States of violating
human rights when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) of the
U.S. terminated the Branch Davidian cult years ago, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said it is in the best interest of American citizens
that China enters the World Trade Organization.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Steering Committee to Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli-Palestinian Steering
Committee for Interim Issues will meet on Sunday and on top of the
agenda is the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails,
Israel Radio reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli chief negotiator Oded Eran and Palestinian chief
negotiator for interim affairs Saeb Erekat will attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
To demand their early release, hundreds of Palestinian prisoners
began a hunger strike at various Israeli jails some 10 days ago. At
Nafha Prison in Beersheba, southern Israel alone, some 150
Palestinians joined the hunger strike.
</P>
<P>
Peace groups in Israel reported that the health of the
Palestinian prisoners who was on hunger strike is deteriorating and
some of them had to be hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian prisoners were also demanding that their release
be part of the final peace deal due in September and that this be
stated in the framework agreement the Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators are trying to reach.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has submitted a list of some 23 Palestinian
prisoners who are old and sick or who have served long jail terms,
asking Israel to release them now.
</P>
<P>
"We expect Israel to give us an answer to our request," Erekat
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side also said the release of more Palestinian
prisoners would be a goodwill gesture aimed to revive the
Palestinian people's faith in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
During the week, Palestinians in self-rule areas held
demonstrations and protests in solidarity with their compatriots on
strike in Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrations turned violent in the West Bank cities of
Ramallah and Bethlehem, at least 18 Palestinians were reportedly
injured in the clashes with Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Israel has released 380 Palestinian prisoners since the signing
of the Sharm el Sheikh peace deal last September.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side said that about 1,600 Palestinians are
still serving prison terms in Israel and many of them were detained
without any trial.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Rights Body Urged to Uncover May Riots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Ethnic Chinese in Indonesia Friday
urged the National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM) to
uncover the truth of the riots two years ago and establish a
special commission to probe into the case and bring those
responsible to justice.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Indonesian Ethnic Chinese Reforms Party (PARTI)
Lieus Sungkharisma told reporters that resolving this case will
represent a very important step for the national reconciliation
process which has been carried on by the government.
</P>
<P>
"This is not about revenge. We also don't want to put our
finger on those who may be responsible (for the riots), but we
just want the justice. The tragedy is not merely the problem of
Indonesian ethnic Chinese here, but is also a national tragedy,
even an international tragedy," he said.
</P>
<P>
On May 13-15, 1998, Indonesia saw the worst looting and rioting
in decades in Jakarta, Medan and Solo. More than 1,300 lives were
claimed, and thousands of buildings and vehicles were damaged. The
rioters also conducted wide-spread rape and torture on ethnic
Chinese women.
</P>
<P>
Sungkharisma confirmed the rape incidents, saying data
collected by the PARTI showed that at least 300 ethnic Chinese
women were raped during the riots, "including a nine-year-old girl.
"
</P>
<P>
"But no victim is willing to give testimony on this issue.
Because if they do so, it will only uncover their last tragedy
which deeply hurt them. But we have data," he said.
</P>
<P>
In response to the PARTI's demand, a member of the Komnas HAM,
B.N. Marbun, said his side will pay attention to the demand, but
has to submit the issue before the plenary session of the Komnas
HAM first.
</P>
<P>
"We are all concerned on this tragedy. We understand but we don
't promise that your demand (to establish a special commission)
will be automatically met. But we will bring your demand before
our plenary session. Let the session decide," Marbun said. He
urged the PARTI to ask the president, the defense minister, the
Military chief, the Police chief and also the House of
Representatives to pay more attention to the issue.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, around 30 youths grouped in the Tionghoa (Chinese)
Youths Solidarity for Justice (Simpatik) staged a rally in front
of the State Palace to urge President Abdurrahman Wahid to punish
any parties responsible for the May riots.
</P>
<P>
The protesters also expressed the hope that the government
would erase all discriminatory regulations applied to ethnic
Chinese.

MANILA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Labor ministers of the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) committed themselves Friday to
intensifying cooperation in human resources development.

<HEADLINE> Sharif Trial Begins in Corruption Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The trial of deposed Pakistani
prime minister Nawaz Sharif in a corruption case started Friday at
Attock Fort, a town some 60 kilometers west of here, by the
Accountability Court.
</P>
<P>
According to the prosecution, Sharif is guilty of concealment
of assets connected with a MI-6 helicopter owned and tax evasion
on it.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution, represented by Prosecutor-General of National
Accountability Bureau Farooq Adam and two other lawyers, said the
former prime minister purchased the helicopter in 1993 for his own
use but did not declare it in his wealth tax return.
</P>
<P>
One of Sharif close allies, former chief of the accountability
bureau Saif-ur-Rehman, who is accused of facilitating the purchase
of the helicopter, also appeared at the court.
</P>
<P>
Friday's trial was the first reference out of three in
accordance with Pakistan's legal procedures.
</P>
<P>
The formal hearing has been adjourned to May 27, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Sharif, deposed in last October in a bloodless coup, blamed the
current military government for subjecting him to psychological
torture.
</P>
<P>
He complained that he was being kept in solitary confinement
and was being denied facilities which would have been provided to
him according to the jail manual.
</P>
<P>
However, Farooq Adam denied that allegation. "The statement of
Nawaz Sharif is not true. It is for political consumption. In fact,
he is being provided more facilities as provided in the jail
manual," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Foreign business people attending a
high-tech industries forum here are showing interest in China's
booming e-commerce market.
</P>
<P>
Mikael Ahlund, vice president of U.S.-based Viewlocity, said,
"We are now offering our best e-commerce service for our customers,
" adding that his company has established good cooperative ties
with China's Ministry of Information Industry.
</P>
<P>
"We want to meet both the opportunities and challenges brought
about by the e-commerce industry together with our Chinese
counterpart," he said.
</P>
<P>
Viewlocity is a leading IT company, and its major Chinese
customers include China Customs, the Ministry of Communications,
the Shenzhen EC Center, the Xiamen EC Center, the China Ocean
Shipping Corporation, and the Legend Group.
</P>
<P>
Ahlund said he believes that as a huge market, China will
surely attract foreign businesses to take a share of its booming e-
commerce market.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Tong, global CEO of MeetChina.com, pointed out that
China's enterprises must keep pace with the development of the e-
commerce industry because they will face fierce competition in the
international market when China joins the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
The forum is being held during the week-long China Beijing
International High-Tech Industries Week that will end today.

<HEADLINE> Scientific Innovations to Dominate Asian Economy: Delegates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Delegates to today's science and
technology round-table meeting at the 11th annual corporate
conference of the U.S. Asia Society concluded that Asia's science
and technology have bright development prospects and will dominate
the future of Asia's economy.
</P>
<P>
Tieo Ming Kian, executive chairman of the National Science and
Technology Board of Singapore, said the development of Asia's
science and technology after the negative impact of the Asian
financial crisis has met with many problems, but still presents
many opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The key is to build a mechanism that can inspire the creativity
of scientific and technological talent, Tieo said, adding that
Singapore will issue more favorable policies to support scientific
and technological innovations later this month.
</P>
<P>
Application of high- and new-technology has provided Asia with
important development opportunities, and the continent is now the
world's largest producer of electronic products, with countries
such as India one of the world's leading software developers.
</P>
<P>
Henry Cornell, managing director of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. of the
U.S., disclosed that his company invested 10 billion U.S. dollars
in Asia last year, mainly in e-commerce, telecommunications, and
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
He also said he believes that Asia should give prime
consideration to the training of qualified personnel.
</P>
<P>
Other delegates said that Asia should seize the opportunity and
be brave in competition, otherwise it will lag far behind.
</P>
<P>
Paul Saffo, director of Institute for the Future, said that the
future Asia should not only be a region that enjoys new technology,
but should also become the source of scientific innovation, and
the key is to have a cooperative and team spirit.
</P>
<P>
He believes that development prospects for Asia's science and
technology will, to a large extent, be decided by the Asian
governments' understanding of scientific and technological
innovations, so they should fully understand the significance of
this and encourage such innovations.
</P>
<P>
Nicholas Platt, president of the Asia Society, who presided
over today's science and technology round-table meeting, concluded
that Asian countries will surely make progress in science and
technology and in turn create an economic miracle as long as they
value training of qualified personnel, increase investment in
science and technology, and expand exchanges and cooperation with
the international scientific and technological community.

<HEADLINE> High-Tech to Shrink Economic Gap Between Eastern and Western China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
But China's western region can no longer depend on the
favorable policies and processing-oriented industries which helped
boost the economy of the coastal area in the 1980s and 1990s,
Zhang noted, and only profitable high-tech industries will gain an
economic leap for the region.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia is expected to gain by starting various high-tech
projects such as the digital port, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
During Beijing High-Tech Week, many provinces and cities in the
western region mapped out development plans, such as the high-tech
agricultural promotion drive in Shaanxi Province, international
cooperation in e-information and bio-medicine in Sichuan Province,
and a Sino-U.S. TV set production line in Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
The areas will not only rely on cheap natural and labor
resources for economic profits, but will also attract domestic and
overseas investment by reform of the tax system and an improved
environment, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
In Yangling of Shaanxi Province, the country's only state-level
agricultural high-tech demonstration zone, some 4.000 technicians
are helping local farmers in an effort to improve agricultural
technology and pollution-free farming techniques in the fields of
biological breeding, water-saving irrigation, and soil
conservation.
</P>
<P>
These efforts have not only greatly improved high-tech
developments in the areas, but also have attracted many investors
from across the world and the signing of trade contracts involving
large investments, he added.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation with the western region will ensure China's eastern
region and overseas business people a good opportunity to find a
large potential market and plenty of room for expansion.

<HEADLINE> High-Tech to Shrink Economic Gap Between Eastern and Western China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Officials from China's western
region agree that high-tech industry will play an important role
in helping the region to catch up with the fast economic
development of eastern China.
</P>
<P>
The officials reached this conclusion after attending Beijing
International High-Tech Industries Week, which ended here today.
</P>
<P>
At the early stage of the country's long-term strategy of
developing the vast western region, ways to shorten the economic
gap between western and eastern China was one of the hottest
topics for both government officials and economic experts during
the event.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia, an inland ethnic autonomous region in northwest China,
has signed an agreement with the state of Utah in the United
States to jointly set up a comprehensive digital port, covering
diversified websites to provide services on information and e-
commerce to governmental departments, industries, enterprises and
individual Internet users in the twelve provinces, autonomous
regions and municipalities of the western region.
</P>
<P>
The project is a major part of Ningxia's plan for economic
development in the 21st century, said Zhang Laiwu, assistant
chairman of the autonomous regional government.
</P>
<P>
Matthew McConkie, commerce representative of Utah in Beijing,
said that Utah is in an inland area of the United States, similar
to Ningxia, and has experienced a backward era in the past.
</P>
<P>
"Now, the state has become one of the most developed areas in
America thanks to the booming of its three high-tech pillar
industries -- software, medical instruments, and biological
engineering," the official said.
</P>
<P>
This can be used for reference in the development of western
China, McConkie said.

JAKARTA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian currency rupiah
plunged to a new low of 8,545 (buying) and 8,575 (selling) to the
U.S. dollar on Friday's session trade.
</P>
<P>
That is the lowest level since President Abdurrahman Wahid took
office on October 20 last year.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah was quoted at 8,360/8,395 against the dollar on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Syahril Sabirin, governor of the Indonesian central bank, Bank
Indonesia (BI), said the weakening of the rupiah was much caused
by political issues instead of economic problems.
</P>
<P>
"The measure (which is going to be taken by BI) doesn't depend
upon what level rupiah stands, but depends upon the market
situation -- whether or not the market situation is deserved to be
intervened," Sabirin was quoted by Antara News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
He also brushed aside suggestions that the floating rate system
be changed.
</P>
<P>
"There is no need to change that," Sabirin said.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Experts Urge Ecology-Friendly Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Nepali experts Friday urged the
government to start eco-labelling the hotels and resorts sprouting
across the country as a first step towards promoting sustainable
tourism and conserving the fragile ecology.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a national seminar on Green Hotels and Eco-
labelling in Tourism Industry here, the experts also expressed
deep concern over the deteriorating environment of the high
mountain areas such as Annapurna and Everest regions, which have
been witnessing an influx of tourists every year.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Pitambar Sharma, regional planner at International Center
for Integrated Mountain Development, said the development of
tourism has brought about both economic opportunities and serious
threats to the mountain ecology in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
He said the impact of mountain tourism in Nepal is manifest in
the increased demand for fuelwood and timber, increased pollution
of non--degradable garbage, lodge construction and changes in land
use.
</P>
<P>
"In spite of the requirement of using alternate fuel by group
trekkers, the consumption of fuelwood is still quite considerable
in all trekking areas," Sharma said.
</P>
<P>
According to Sharma, lodge density per kilometer of trail in
ecologically fragile trekking regions is alarmingly high.
</P>
<P>
Sharma called on the government and the tourism entrepreneurs
to address these problems through the promotion of alternative and
renewable energy, eco-friendly materials and "ecologically
responsible management of solid waste."
</P>
<P>
"Environment-friendly building materials, alternative energy
systems to replace the use of firewood, aesthetic vernacular
architecture, plantation and greening of the local environment and
appreciation of local culture should be priority themes for eco-
labelling tourism," Sharma suggested.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director of Jomsom Mountain Resort Sanjay Pradhan said
making tourism entrepreneurs and locals environment conscious,
promoting local art, culture and architecture, using energy-saving
equipment would be the key to making tourism sustainable.
</P>
<P>
"Eco-labelling tourism business can bring about tremendous
benefits to entrepreneurs," he said, cautioning at the same time
that eco-friendly standards should be clearly defined and suitable
to local requirements.
</P>
<P>
About 50 tourism experts, entrepreneurs and government
officials exchanged views on sustainable tourism development in
Nepal at the two-day seminar jointly organized by Hotel
Association of Nepal and Nepal Bureau of Standards and Metrology.
</P>
<P>
As the home to eight of the 14 mountains over 8,000 meters in
the world, Nepal is a favorite destination for world trekkers and
tourists. About 500,000 tourists visited Nepal in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President Warns Observers in Coming Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa has warned international observers against interfering with
the forthcoming general elections scheduled for October 29.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a public rally in Zanzibar on Thursday, the
president said international observers must strictly adhere to
procedures to be spelt out by the concerned authorities, the
official Daily News reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa, who has declared to run for a second five-year term,
said his administration will take measures against any one who
will act irresponsibly in the election exercise, beginning with
the registration of voters to the polling day on October 29.
</P>
<P>
He said Tanzania is a free country and has the right to decide
the "best way" to run its affairs without any external
interference.
</P>
<P>
"We want to ensure fair play during the elections," Mkapa said,
adding that observers are free to air their views on the way the
election process is conducted but the government is also at
liberty to protect the interests of Tanzanians.
</P>
<P>
He said it is politically improper for one to believe that
elections are free and fair when the opposition removes the ruling
party from power.
</P>
<P>
"The ruling party usually makes better strategies that will
enable it to win elections," said Mkapa, who is also the ruling
Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) national chairman.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Pledges Nigeria's Reinforcement to S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
Thursday reiterated that Nigeria is ready to send more
peacekeeping troops to Sierra Leone, saying the nation's soldiers
who died would have died in vain if the peace collapsed in that
west African country.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian newspaper Friday quoted him as saying that "we
have made sacrifice in Sierra Leone before and if we want to make
more sacrifices, we could appeal to Nigerians to understand".
</P>
<P>
But the president also insisted that the United Nations should
finance the proposed Nigerian operations.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, which dominated West African Peace Keeping Force or
ECOMOG, had fought three years of wars with Sierra Leone rebels
since 1997, keeping President Tejan Kabbah in power, before its
withdrawal last month on finical considerations.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo said in Abuja, Nigeria's capital, that "Nigerian
soldiers have lived in Sierra Leone for many years. They know the
terrain, they know the people".

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian government has

government departments would be held accountable for inefficiency.

Government departments and regulatory agencies have been
directed to evaluate and make positive changes in their procedures
for acquisition of licenses, permits and other authorizations in a
bid to encourage foreign investors, he said.
</P>
<P>
Urgent measures are also required to put in place and improved
 regulatory framework will motivate existing and future investors,

enormous and the Tanzanian Investment Center has registered 1,496

<HEADLINE> Seoul, Pyongyang to Hold Working-Level Talks for Summit Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Seoul and Pyongyang will hold expert-
level talks Saturday to discuss issues on communications and media
coverage for the inter-Korean summit slated to open on June 12-14,
the South Korean Unification Ministry said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The two sides will meet to discuss specific technical issues
concerning the two procedural matters," ministry spokesman Lee
Kwan-se said.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the two sides will meet on Saturday morning in the
Peace House on the southern part of the truce village of Panmunjom.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are expected to discuss technical issues related
to media coverage and communications including the satellite news
gathering system, which is necessary for live broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
Another meeting on protocol and security is to be held next
Tuesday in the Unification House on the northern side of the truce
village.
</P>
<P>
In the past four preparatory meetings for the summit, South
Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) agreed
on 15 points of the 16-point agreement on procedural matters after
the Korean War in the early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
The last remaining issue that stands in the way of both sides
hammering out a deal is the size of the South Korean press corps,
with Pyongyang insisting that Seoul's proposed number of 80
members be halved.
</P>
<P>
With the fourth round of talks ending without a full agreement
last Monday, the two parties have continued their talks via inter-
Korean Red Cross hotlines at the truce village.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said South Korea sent its draft agreement to
Pyongyang Thursday, in which Seoul did not reduce the number of
the press corps.
</P>
<P>
It looks unlikely that Pyongyang will change its position on
the number of press corps. Seoul will likely have to come to some
kind of agreement with Pyongyang on the issue, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
In early April this year, South Korea and the DPRK reached an
agreement in China to hold the inter-Korean summit.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, South Korean President Kim Dae-jung will
travel to Pyongyang to meet DPRK leader Kim Jung Il on June 12-14.

DALIAN, May 12 (Xinhua) -- One man is still missing after a
fishing vessel was wrecked at sea near Snake Island in northeast
China.
</P>
<P>
Four others were rescued by a nearby ship which had received an
SOS.

<P>
The fishing boat was caught on a heavy object on the seabed as
it was working on the high seas at 39.58 degrees north latitude
and 120.51 degrees east longitude in the small hours of Monday
morning.

<P>
The ship sank soon after it sent out the SOS. A nearby ship
sped to the location and rescued four of the five people on board
with the help of searchlights.
</P>
<P>
Police are still searching at sea for the captain. According to
the police, the ship was possibly hauled by the current after its

<HEADLINE> Overseas Developers Vying for Piece of China's Real Estate Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- More than 5,000 overseas real
estate enterprises, or 20 percent of China's total, have been
participating in the country's real estate development, according
to the Chinese Ministry of Construction.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by preferential treatment, overseas real estate
developers are vying for China's vast market, and expect to profit
well from their investments.
</P>
<P>
A ministry source said that the investment structure of China's
real estate sector has been greatly improved due to the vigorous
implementation of the new housing reform plan focused on stopping
the allocation of housing by the state. Most of the overseas funds
have been channeled into construction of residential housing.
</P>
<P>
Experts with the ministry say that with the sound development
of the economy, the real estate sector will shift its focus from
key cities to small- and medium-sized cities, and from coastal
areas to the inland region.
</P>
<P>
According to these experts, the country's housing construction
is expected to grow at an annual rate of 15 percent early in the
next century.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2005, China will build an additional 1.5 billion
square meters of housing in urban areas and 3.5 billion square
meters of housing in rural areas, providing more opportunities for
overseas real estate developers.

<HEADLINE> China to Have Master of Public Administration Degrees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- China will have Master of Public
Administration (MPA) degrees in addition to the Master of Business
Administration (MBA), according to the International Public Policy
and Administration Conference which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Approved by the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council
last May, the MPA will have its first group of pursuers this
October.
</P>
<P>
Insiders say that China is in great need of administration
professionals in both enterprises and government to ensure
efficient and coordinated decision-making and management systems.
</P>
<P>
The MPA is a comprehensive branch of learning similar to that
of the MBA. It applies the sciences of management, politics, and
economics to study the operation of public organizations,
especially governments.
</P>
<P>
The MPA program is a major avenue for cultivating professionals
specializing in public administration.
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the Public Administration School of Qinghua
University, the two-day conference is being attended by professors
from renowned universities both in China and abroad, government
officials, and enterprise managers.

<HEADLINE> S.Lankan Troops, Rebels Fight Intense Battles Near Jaffna </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan government troops and
Tamil Tiger rebels have fought intense battles near the northern
key town of Jaffna, a government statement said Friday.
</P>
<P>
It said the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels
launched two attacks Thursday afternoon in Ariyalai and
Tanankilappu in the northern Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
"Two officers and seven soldiers were killed in action," said
the statement, adding that 86 others were wounded and evacuated to
hospitals in Colombo and Palaly in the north of Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels, fighting for a separate homeland for minority
Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983, are on a
ferocious assault to recapture their former stronghold of Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
The statement said troops had to readjust their defenses from
Ariyalai towards Colombuturai east due to a heavy volume of rebel
mortar fire.
</P>
<P>
However, troops launched a counterattack, causing many
casualties among the rebels, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"The confrontation lasted for more than five hours," it said.
</P>
<P>
In Tanankilappu, troops supported by aircraft, MI24 helicopter
gunships and artillery fought back rebel attacks, causing
casualties among rebels.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga has
called on the army to stand firm in its battle with the LTTE in
the northern Jaffna peninsula. She told the troops they possessed
the capability and determination to defeat the enemy.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga said steps were already being taken to supply the
troops within the next few weeks with the "most modern armaments,
equipment and technology" needed to defeat the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels, who have vowed to take back the peninsula,
have made sweeping gains in the past weeks of fighting.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Continue Efforts for Safe Release of Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government reassured
the international community Friday that it is now exhausting all
possible means to reestablish contact with Abu Sayyaf extremists,
which are holding 21 hostages, mostly foreigners, in Jolo island.
</P>
<P>
Presidential adviser Roberto Aventajado said in a press
statement that the military's accidental approach in that area
Thursday, where a government negotiating team was supposed to meet
the kidnappers, stalled talks for the release of the hostages. But
he said the issue was being addressed immediately.
</P>
<P>
"We sent emissaries again. We expect to reestablish contact
today," said Aventajado, who is also chairman of the presidential
committee on flagship projects and programs.
</P>
<P>
Government negotiator Ghazali Ibrahim and the former Libyan
ambassador were supposed to meet for the second time with the
hostage takers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado said the government negotiating team continued to
coordinate with representatives of the hostage takers in a bid to
resume negotiations, adding that the military has already agreed
to move further away from the area where the hostages are being
held.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado was sent by President Joseph Estrada to Mindanao to
help in the hostage negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado also belied reports that the hostage takers are
demanding a ransom for the release of ailing German national
Renate Wallert.
</P>
<P>
He similarly dismissed reports that the hostage takers demanded
"political recognition" from the Organization of the Islamic
Conference (OIC), and 50,000 pesos (1,250 U.S. dollars) to 70,000
pesos (1,750 dollars) per hostage for their "board and lodging"
expenses.
</P>
<P>
"We have not received such demands. We are still discussing the
framework of the talks," he said, adding that the government is
sticking to its no-ransom policy in securing the safe release of
the hostages.

<HEADLINE> Pantani to Compete in Tour of Italy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Top Italian cyclist Marco Pantani will
compete in the Tour of Italy cycling race which gets underway here
Saturday, president Felice Gimondi of the Mercatone Uno team
confirmed on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Gimondi made the announcement as the race participants along
with Pantani arrived in the Vatican City.
</P>
<P>
The Tour of Italy begins on May 13 with a prologue in Rome
arriving in front of St Peter's Basilica in the Vatican City and
finishes in Milan on June 4.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old cyclist, who won both the Tour of Italy and the
Tour of France in 1998, has barely competed since he was thrown
off last year's Tour of Italy at Madonna di Campiglio on the
penultimate day while wearing the leader's pink jersey after a
blood test showed a level above the 50 percent threshold.
</P>
<P>
Gimondi noted that Pantani would also compete in the Tour de
France in July.
</P>
<P>
The 2000 Tour of Italy will comprise 21 stages over 3707
kilometers with two time-trials of 32km and 45km respectively.
</P>
<P>
Given the significance of the Millennium, organisers tried to
make the Giro visit every part of Italy and the only regions to
miss out this year are the islands of Sardinia and Sicily and the
Val d'Aosta.
</P>
<P>
There will be three mountain stages at Albetone, Pratonevoso
and Sestriere with the highest peak scaled the 2748m Agnello peak
on the 19th stage.

<HEADLINE> Expert Views Exports as Chance for China to Develop E-Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Exports are the most realistic way
for China to develop its e-commerce, and only through exports can
the country's e-commerce catch up with international competitors.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Tong, global CEO of MeetChina.com, made this remark at a
forum yesterday which was part of the ongoing Beijing High-Tech
Week.
</P>
<P>
MeetChina.com is an e-commerce portal jointly developed by
China's Ministry of Information Industry and the U.S. Business
Network Inc. last year. It is intended to provide services for
Chinese enterprises to develop e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
Tong said e-commerce will become the new growth point in the
global economy in the 21st century and its impact will be
irreversible.
</P>
<P>
Since China's exports have been growing rapidly in recent years,
it will be the most realistic chance for China to develop its
fledging e-commerce, he repeated.
</P>
<P>
China's exports last year reached 193 billion US dollars, 5
percent higher than 1998, and they are expected to surpass 210
billion dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
Predictions also says that China's export growth this year will
be seven percent, with export volume reaching 250 billion dollars
by the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
After China enters the World Trade Organization, foreign
importers, especially those in the United States and Europe, will
want to avoid middlemen and buy directly from the Chinese
manufacturers, according to Tong.
</P>
<P>
As more foreign customers are expected to use the Internet as
their major means of trading, Chinese manufactures should also
develop e-commerce in order to do business with them, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out, most Chinese enterprises have not
realized the need to develop e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
At present, only one out of one thousand Chinese enterprises
have gone online, and there are only 48,000 domain names in the
country, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Observers here note that China began to realize the importance
of developing e-commerce several years ago. Since 1996, it has
established a primary framework of international e-commerce and
opened connections in almost 80 cities across the country.
</P>
<P>
China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation has
on-line service on China Export Commodities Fair held annually in

<HEADLINE> China Spends 53.1 Billion Yuan on Farm Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- China spent 53.1 billion yuan on
projects to improve the irrigation and eliminate the water-logging
of farmland during last winter and this spring period, .
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Ministry of Water Resources indicate that
during the period, 1.2 million hectares of irrigated farmland were
added and the irrigation of 4.34 million hectares of farmland was
improved; 1.13 million hectares of water-logging farmland were
improved and over 2 million hectares of low-yielding fields were
also improved.
</P>
<P>
Flood-control projects also went smoothly, with 37,600
kilometers of river levees consolidated and 75,000 kilometers of
river beds dredged. Most major dikes on the Yangtze, Yellow, and
Huaihe rivers also were reinforced.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics, the amount of water-saving
irrigation area increased by 1.49 million hectares during the
period, and the nation's water-saving irrigation area now accounts
for nearly one-third of all the country's irrigation area.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, environmental protection projects were on the
rise, with 347,000 sq km of soil-erosion area brought under
control.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to repair and consolidate small reservoirs and ponds
also paid off. As a result, small reservoirs and ponds increased
their water-holding capacity by 1.9 billion cubic meters,
providing enough drinking water for more than 13 million rural
residents.

<HEADLINE> China Auctions Medical Products for First Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese herbal compound that can
be used as a pain killer for cancer patients became the biggest
winner in China's first-time auction of hi-tech medical products
in Beijing last night.
</P>
<P>
The property-right holder of the medicine sold ten percent of
its future stock shares at a price of 36 million yuan (4.3 million
U.S. dollars) to a health product company, six million yuan more
than the opening bid.
</P>
<P>
Guishen Pain-killer, whose major ingredients include cassia
bark, white peony root, and opium poppy, attracted interest before
the auction because the rights holder intended to sell the entire
intellectual property rights at a price of 300 million yuan (36
million U.S. dollars), which was described as "unimaginable" by
the media.
</P>
<P>
But no buyers responded at the auction, so the auctioneer
changed the lot into stock shares at the request of the property-
rights holder. The buyer was identified as Jingzang Health Co. Ltd.
by today's Beijing Daily.
</P>
<P>
This auction was the first of its kind in China, organized by
the Pharmaceutical and Health Technology Development and Research
Center under the Ministry of Health, aiming to "pave way to the
market for scientific study results."
</P>
<P>
China's pharmaceutical industry has long been troubled by the
fact that research results could not be put into production
immediately due to a lack of proper channels.
</P>
<P>
Rui Guozhong, an official with the center, said the auction was
very successful because the potential value of the products, most
of which have not been put into production, was recognized through
the activity.
</P>
<P>
Of the 14 other auction lots, four were successfully sold at
total price of 31.8 million yuan ( 3.8 million U.S. dollars),
including a liquefied herbal medicine for the treatment of heart
failure, a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) capsule targeting
senile vertigo, and a bio-engineered diarrhea vaccine.
</P>
<P>
Many enterprises were also very interested in the other ten
auction lots, even though they failed to find buyers.

<HEADLINE> Unleaded Gas Use Prevents Poisoning in Children: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The widespread use of unleaded gas
has greatly reduced the incidence of lead poisoning among children,
according to a two-year study conducted by Chinese researchers.
</P>
<P>
The rate of lead poisoning among children from aged one to six
dropped from 37.8 percent in 1997 to 24.8 percent in 1999 in
Shanghai, where the use of unleaded gas began in 1998, said
Professor Shen Xiaoming at a Shanghai research center for the
prevention and control of lead poisoning among children.
</P>
<P>
The average level of lead content in their blood decreased from
83 micrograms per liter to 76 mg per liter in the 1997-1999 period,
said Shen, who led the research, in today's Wen Hui Bao daily.
</P>
<P>
Lead in the air is inhaled by people when it is emitted from
motor vehicles which burn leaded gas.
</P>
<P>
Previous studies have shown close links between a low
intelligence quotient in children and high levels of lead
pollution, a heavy metal which can harm the nervous system. Too
high a level of lead content in the blood may also cause childhood
restlessness and learning disorders.
</P>
<P>
The research was carried out among 1,972 kindergarten children
in five districts of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
However, Professor Shen said the serious lead poisoning
situation cannot be totally eased until children are spared
potential dangers from pencils, pencil boxes, and toys covered
with lead paint.
</P>
<P>
China to date has no national standards to keep the lead
content in these products under a safe level, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Sells Warplanes to Sri Lanka for Fighting Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Israel has agreed to supply Sri
Lanka with Kfir fighter jets under a deal made earlier this week as
Colombo reacts to an escalation of tension and significant advances
by Tamil Tiger rebels in the north, the Israeli daily Ha'aretz said
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Israel sought United States Defense Department's approval before
signing the final agreement with Sri Lanka as the Kfir has an
American engine. But the paper did not reveal how many jets will be
sold under the deal.
</P>
<P>
This is the second largest arms deal between the two nations in
recent months, following the sale of two Sa'ar 4.5 missile boats to
the Sri Lanka navy just a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of a recent decision by Sri Lanka to resume
diplomatic ties with Israel, the Israeli deputy Defense Ministry
Chief Executive Officer on Asian affairs, Yitzhak Shelef, met his
Sri Lankan counterpart on Thursday in Jerusalem for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka, which is on an urgent defensive against Tamil rebels,
has been sending delegations of army officials to Israel in recent
weeks to discuss Israel's possible supply of weapons systems, arms
and secondary systems.
</P>
<P>
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam have been fighting 17 years
for an independent state for Sri Lanka's 3.2 million minority
Tamils. The rebel forces Thursday were reported to have captured
strategic locations on the outskirts of Jaffna, which they claim as
their cultural capital.
</P>
<P>
Israel sold five Kfir jets to the Sri Lanka air force five years
ago. The latest set of jets to be sold were part of a reserve held
by the Israel Air Force and will first have to be upgraded, which
will involve installing advanced avionics systems.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka will pay 3 million U.S. dollars for each Kfir. The
Israeli defense establishment is currently looking into a Colombo
request for additional weapons systems.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka, which cut off relations with Israel twice before,
once in 1970 and once in 1990, announced its decision to resume
official ties with Israel on May 4.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Defense Spending Slashed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Defense spending accounted for less
than 3 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) of Cyprus last
year, for the first time since 1980s, the Cyprus Weekly newspaper
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The defense expenditure in 1999 was 257 million Cyprus pounds
(514 million U.S. dollars), or 2.9 percent of GDP, as compared to
489 million pounds (978 million dollars), or 5.5 percent of GDP, in
1998.
</P>
<P>
An expert of the Cyprus Center for Strategic Studies attributed
the 47-percent drop to possible changes in the government's defense
policies and the current spirit of rapprochement between Greece and
Turkey, the main power brokers behind the two communities in
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing diplomatic activity to solve the Cyprus issue
through U.N.-sponsored talks, as well as the need for Cyprus to
comply with criteria of the European Union for membership, also
played a role in curtailing military spending.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus plans to spend 224 million pounds (448 million dollars)
on defense this year, accounting for 4.2 percent of GDP, the expert
said.
</P>
<P>
However, he expected that military spending will not be much
higher than that of last year, in view of the pressure to reduce
public debt in the country.

<HEADLINE> More Policemen to Be Fielded in Central Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
deploy more policemen in the central part of the country even as
the region has been placed on "high alert," a report from Western
Visayas said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Philippine National Police (PNP) Director General Panfilo
Lacson, who was there Thursday as guest speaker at a convention of
government accountants, told reporters that the alert status was
ordered mainly because of the current Mindanao conflict that might
spread to other places of the country.
</P>
<P>
The alert status has been ordered not only in Western Visayas
but also in the entire Luzon and Visayas areas, particularly in
raid-prone police units, Lacson was quoted by Philippine News
Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Lacson said the additional forces from the national police
office would be deployed in Panay Island to handle the anti-
insurgency campaign here.
</P>
<P>
The PNP and the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) had
discussed ways to handle the anti-insurgency campaign on the
island, he said, adding that only the Special Forces from the Army
's Special Operations Command were left on the island.
</P>
<P>
The PNP should always be on guard against possible attacks from
rebels, who might take advantage of the army's absence on the
island, said Lacson.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, PNP regional director Jose Ayap said he had already
ordered his men to take special safety precautions in tourist
destinations.
</P>
<P>
Ayap said the order came even before the Department of Tourism
raised its concern about possible terrorist attacks that may take
place in the numerous island resorts within the region.
</P>
<P>
"As soon as the kidnapping took place, I immediately told my
commanders in the field to take necessary measures to protect the
various points of entry in the region," Ayap said.

NAIROBI, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia launched a fresh offensive
against Eritrea on the right and left flanks of the Mereb-Setit
front shortly after mid-night on Friday, according to a news
release by Eritrean Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi
declared to the diplomatic community in Addis Ababa as well as to
the visiting U.N. Security Council mission that Ethiopia is "going
to war and it will resolve the conflict very soon", the release
said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the way of ending the conflict, Meles said on
Monday that both the peaceful and military options have been with
Ethiopia for the past two years, and the two options will continue
with Ethiopia as long as the war goes on.
</P>
<P>
"We have not closed the peaceful option, we have also not
closed the military option either," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
The fresh offensive followed the collapse of peace talks
between the two countries in Algiers and the shuttle diplomacy by
a U.N. Security Council delegation which visited both capitals in
the middle of this week.

"It will be a key task of the new government to consolidate the
latest positive trends in the economy. If we can do that, then it
can be said that the country has come to a better economy and
we'll no longer be threatened by unforeseen crises and all those
problems, into which the population has run more than once,"
Kasyanov said on Russia's ORT television.
</P>
<P>
He said this is achievable by painstaking work of all power
branches and motivation to fund a consensus among the president,
the parliament and the government.
</P>
<P>
"If we manage to hold this for one more year, then we can say
that foundations for sustained growth have been created," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said priority policies will be carried out to improve tax
systems and the investment climate in the state.
</P>
<P>
He called for reducing the tax burden on Russian manufacturers
in the nearest future. This would help keep key macroeconomic
indicators, including the ruble rate and Central Bank reserves, at
due level, said the acting prime minister.
</P>
<P>
On Chechnya, Kasyanov said that the government has worked out
two programs: the program of pressing measures to revive the
republic and a program of restoring the full-scale operation of
the economy in the coming two or three years.
</P>
<P>
He expressed optimism over the chances of his approval as prime
minister. Nominated for prime minister by President Vladimir Putin,
Kasyanov is yet to be endorsed by the State Duma, lower house of
parliament, on May 17.

<HEADLINE> China Encourages Financial Enterprises to Go Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- China's top securities regulator
has said that the government encourages financial enterprises to
go public on the conditions that the stock market will be further
regularized and the issuance system reformed.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Xiaochuan, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory
Commission (CSRC), was quoted by today's China Securities News as
saying yesterday that going public will not only help improve
capital structure, management, and the competitive edge of
financial enterprises, but will also help optimize the structure
of companies listed on the stock market to cope with the needs of
China's further opening to the world.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that nearly all the major commercial banks,
securities companies, and insurance businesses in the world are
listed companies, adding that with the development of the stock
market in China, going public is inevitable for China's financial
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Zhou told a symposium in Beijing that if financial enterprises
are going to go public, there must be additional requirements on
information disclosure, such as the quality of their assets and
changes in major indices of risk exposure.
</P>
<P>
He also said that experienced international service firms might
be employed to help step up the auditing of listed financial firms.
</P>
<P>
The regulator disclosed that the CSRC is drafting an
information disclosure guide for listed financial enterprises, and
is working with other authorities to solve all the remaining
issues so that more of these enterprises will be allowed to issue
their stocks as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> China Launches "Super Hybrid Rice"Genome Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists in Beijing have
begun a "super hybrid rice" genome program in an effort to take
the lead in deciphering the genetic code of high-yield and high-
quality hybrid rice.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from the Beijing Huada Gene Research Center, the
State Hybrid Rice Engineering Research Center, and the Institute
of Genetics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), plan within
a year to sequence 430 million base-pairs of the so called super
hybrid rice.
</P>
<P>
Super hybrid rice was first cultivated by Yuan Longping, the
initiator of the cultivation of Chinese hybrid rice.
</P>
<P>
The scientists say the launching of this program is aimed at
raising rice yield and improving rice quality in a bid to enable
China to take the lead in hybrid rice production in the world.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists hope to take three to five years to push
ahead their work from the hybrid rice genome research to molecular
seed breeding, and even field growth.
</P>
<P>
Experts here believe that this research program indicates that
China's genome research has entered a new phase since
participating in the international human genome research program.
</P>
<P>
They said that deciphering the genetic code of super hybrid
rice is of great importance for learning related genetic
information for wheat, maize, and other major crops.
</P>
<P>
The highest yield of the hybrid rice cultivated by Yuan
Longping has reached 17,070 kilograms per hectare.

<P>
JERUSALEM, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Israeli newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak Thursday reiterated his
determination to pull the Israel Defense Forces out of south
Lebanon by July, even though he admitted the withdrawal would not
be without risks.
</P>
<P>
Barak maintained that, after a period of calm, there would be
far fewer risks of more Israeli soldiers or civilians being killed.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who was inspecting the IDF Northern Command's
headquarters in Safed, said the setting of a deadline for the
withdrawal indicated clearly that the move was at the initiative of
the government and not because of Hezbollah pressure.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel has agreed to supply Sri Lanka with Kfir fighter jets.
The deal was made earlier this week as Colombo was faced with an
escalation of tension and significant advances by Tamil Tiger
rebels in the north.
</P>
<P>
The Israel Aircraft Industries' Kfir has an American engine and
Israel was seeking Pentagon approval before signing the final
agreement with Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government has also given its full support to the
deal since it fears that the rising Tamil Tiger power could lead to
the conflict spilling into southern Indian.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Arab leaders are demanding the dismissal of Northern
Region police chief Alik Ron, after he shot and wounded an Arab
driver during a car chase on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The incident, which occurred while Ron was on his way to work at
regional police headquarters in Nazareth, is now the subject of an
inquiry by the Justice Ministry's Police Investigation Unit.
</P>
<P>
The driver is suspected of driving in a manner that endangered
other motorists, trying to run down a policeman, and refusing
repeated police demands to stop, according to police.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- A panel of seven High Court justices Thursday overturned a
decision by the Prison Parole Board and denied early release to
convicted murderer Yoram Shkolnik, who shot dead a handcuffed
Palestinian.
</P>
<P>
Shkolnik received a life sentence in 1993 for the murder, but
Israel's Prison Parole Board planned to release him on April 7
because of his alleged good behavior in the prison. The High Court
justices ruled that his release would pose a risk to public safety.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's decision was made in response to a petition submitted
by Meretz Knesset (parliament) member Zahava Galon, who argued that
the parole board's decision did not take into account the severity
of the criminal's act.

NEW DELHI, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Eleven people, including 10

<HEADLINE> Manila Pledges to Address Tension in Mindanao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Friday that it will continue to do everything to address the
tension in isolated areas in the south of the country.
</P>
<P>
In a radio speech, Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said the
government "is unanimous in that we can have a ceasefire only when
the conditions are met," in response to calls from some sectors
for the government to declare a ceasefire in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The government has said military operations in Mindanao are
only a response to the repeated violations by the Moro Islamic
liberation Front (MILF) of an existing ceasefire agreement with
the government, as shown by the rebels' attacks on civilians in
Kauswagan, North Lanao and the occupation of the Narciso Ramos
Highway in Mguindanao.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 soldiers have been killed and hundreds others
wounded in recent military clashes in the central Mindanao, where
some 120,000 civilians have fled their homes to avoid crossfire.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said the MILF must accept two conditions set by the
government for ceasing the military operations -- the rebels lay
down their arms and release all its hostages.
</P>
<P>
He also urged all vigilante groups in Mindanao to stop their
activities, stressing that only the police and military are
empowered to enforce law and order.
</P>
<P>
Zamora added that the government has already directed local
officials in the areas concerned to address this situation.
</P>
<P>
"We told Mindanao governors not to tolerate any kind of
vigilante action in their areas because if you do that, you would
just be arming one community against another. We don't want that
to happen," he said.

<HEADLINE> Wildfire Runs out of Control Around U.S. Nuclear Laboratory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 20,000 people have fled
in front of the wind-driven firestorm as firefighters battled the
flames around Los Alamos where the first atomic bomb was built in
1945.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the out-of-control wildfire, whole neighborhoods
in Los Alamos have been reduced to ashes, according to reports
from the site on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Everything is being done that can be done. And yet, we may
just be seeing the beginning of what is a real catastrophe," said
New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson.
</P>
<P>
Winds of up to 100 kph pushed the fire Thursday from block to
block in the deserted town. Firefighters battled house to house,
but within hours, some neighborhoods were reduced to rows of
lonely chimneys poking up from piles of cinders.
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe how many homes are gone," said Don Shainin, a
fire battalion commander from Albuquerque who came to Los Alamos
to help.
</P>
<P>
"There really isn't anything ground crews can do," said U.S.
Fire Service Chief Mike Dombeck. "And there are even challenges
with aircraft -- so we're sort of at the mercy of the weather
right now."
</P>
<P>
An estimated 400 homes have burned, when blowtorch-like winds
caused the wildfire to expand dramatically from 3,700 acres to 18,
000 acres in just five hours Thursday. By the end of the day
authorities estimated 20,000 acres had burned.
</P>
<P>
Those flames also came within 300 yards of a plutonium storage
facility at the Los Alamos National Laboratories, the nation's
leading nuclear laboratory. But lab officials insisted that
dangerous materials were protected in fireproof facilities strong
enough to withstand a crash of a 747 jetliner.
</P>
<P>
"We can assure the country and New Mexico that our nuclear
materials are safe," said Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, a
former New Mexico congressman.
</P>
<P>
Water-bombing helicopters and planes dropping fire retardant on
the relentless blaze sent plumes of smoke so high into the sky
they could be easily seen from space.
</P>
<P>
Los Alamos and surrounding communities, including Espanola and
White Rock, became virtual ghost towns after authorities ordered
the evacuation of at least 18,000 people, most of whom headed for
the bigger cities of Santa Fe and Albuquerque, 100-150 kilometers
away.
</P>
<P>
The fire was set May 4 by the National Park Service to clear
bush near Bandelier, but it burned out of control in the dry,
windy weather. A special National Weather Service forecast faxed
to the park beforehand said fire-growth conditions were at their
highest.
</P>
<P>
Park Superintendent Roy Weaver has taken responsibility for the
fire.
</P>
<P>
New Mexico Senator Pete Domenici, touring the scene with Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson, said he would ask Congress' General
Accounting Office to investigate the Park Service decision.
</P>
<P>
"I believe someone is responsible. ... We'll know by next week
why it started, if it was a good thing to do or the equivalent of
a mistake. I think the latter," the senator said.
</P>
<P>
The Park Service, however, has defended its actions in
Bandelier, saying that controlled burns have been a proven and
accepted tool in forest management for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton, who declared the region a federal
disaster area on Wednesday, offered his sympathies to the people
forced to evacuate.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very, very difficult situation, and I know that the
prayers and support of all Americans will be with the people out
there," Clinton said at a White House event.

despite the vast differences between Denmark and China in history,

<HEADLINE> MKO Member, Iraqi Bandits Arrested in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 12 (Xinhua) -- A member of Mujaheddin Khalq
Organization (MKO), the Iraq-based Iranian military opposition
group, and two armed Iraqis have been arrested after they
infiltrating into Iran, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The MKO member and Iraqi bandits" were arrested Wednesday night
on the border of the southwestern Khuzestan province, the Iranian
armed forces said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Iranian border guards also confiscated a number of weapons and
materials from the group, including 40-plus mortar shells, rifles
and pistols, cyanide tablets, detailed maps, geographical
coordinate identifiers, forged documents and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a military officer said that at least 30 MKO members
were killed and a dozen others injured and arrested in the past
Iranian calendar year which ended March 19 when they were trying to
creep into Iran from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The MKO has launched three mortar attacks in the past three
months on government buildings and military headquarters in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
It has become more active in sending sabotaging groups into Iran
as the power struggle between the powerful conservatives and the
reformist allied with President Mohammad Khatami intensified.
</P>
<P>
A famous political-military group which fought against the late
shah's regime in the 1970s, the MKO was outlawed in 1981 and forced
to flee to Iraq after splitting with the ruling clergy, brought to
power by the 1979 Islamic Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Accused as a terrorist group by Tehran, the MKO carried out a
series of cross-border attacks and assassinations of senior Iranian
officials in recent years. In retaliation, Tehran staged several
air raids on MKO bases inside Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Three Countries Support Zimbabwe's Land Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Three countries have backed the
Zimbabwean government's efforts to redistribute land and called
for non-interference as Zimbabweans search for a durable solution
to the problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after presenting their credentials to Zimbabwean
President Robert Mugabe in Harare Thursday, ambassadors from Mali,
Liberia and Cyprus said land was such a fundamental resource that
an unfair ownership pattern would exacerbate the situation, The
Herald reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The current land reform is part of efforts by the Zimbabwean
government to free itself from the chains of colonialism. It's
all part of the decolonization process which needs to be solved
now," said Mali's first ambassador to Zimbabwe Louis Batide, who
will be based in Pretoria, South Africa.
</P>
<P>
New Liberian ambassador to Zimbabwe Liwellyn Witherspoon said
that his country appreciates measures taken by President Mugabe in
trying to resolve the land imbalance. "Colonial powers and the
developed world have to realize that they have an obligation to
assist the government of Zimbabwe and its people achieve their
goals," he said.
</P>
<P>
New High Commissioner of Cyprus Elias Eliades said land
problems were not unique to Zimbabwe. Cyprus was also a victim of
British imperialism.

<HEADLINE> Intel Plans Internet Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Intel Corp., the largest chip
maker in the world, Thursday announced a plan to spend 200 million
U.S. dollars over two years to build an Internet media business
that will allow customers to transmit everything via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The plan includes two broadcasting centers connected to a
dedicated communications network, bypassing many of the Internet
traffic jams that can interrupt the flow of heavy-duty Web content
such as movies, radio, live concerts or video conferencing,
according to reports from the company.
</P>
<P>
The two broadcast centers, already under construction, will be
equipped with production and editing equipment for customers. The
first is scheduled to open in July in Portland, Ore., and the
second in London later this year.
</P>
<P>
While the personal computer market, which uses Intel's
microprocessors as the brains of PCs, is growing strong, industry
analysts point to the fact that Intel has in the past year been
seeking to reposition itself as the predominant supplier of
building blocks of the Internet economy.
</P>
<P>
Intel cited figures from the Internet Research Group predicting
that the market for streaming media services -- audio and video on
the Web -- would soar more than 20-fold to 2.5 billion dollars by
2004.
</P>
<P>
The company also announced initial customers, including Nasdaq.
com, Comedy.com, MeTV.com and Golf Magazine, adding that at least
one of these customers had replaced its streaming media services
from competitors to Intel.
</P>
<P>
Intel launched its streaming-media efforts in February with a
few customers and will this summer have completed its first "
broadcast operations center" in Portland, Oregon, a state in which
Intel is already the largest private employer.
</P>
<P>
The new Intel venture comes amid a mad dash by cable and phone
companies to upgrade their systems for high-speed Web services.
</P>
<P>
While a third of the nation's homes now have Internet access,
most still use a dial-up telephone connection. But while only
about 3 million homes currently use high-speed connections, that
number is expected to multiply rapidly in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Intel also plans to work closely with telephone and cable TV
companies to provide a smooth hand-off when Web content crosses
from its network to the local link reaching a home or business.
</P>
<P>
"The increased availability of broadband connections to the
Internet is starting to create significant markets for using those
connections for streaming media," said Peter Christy, an industry
analyst for Jupiter Communications.
</P>
<P>
In addition to capturing a share of a hot market, Intel's
streaming media business may also drive demand for its main
product: high-speed chips needed to power computers that receive
and play the Web content.
</P>
<P>
"Intel realized the Internet was a constraint on people using
high-powered chips. When you get a DSL connection or a cable modem
connection, there's a lot of interesting things you can do that
require a more potent chip," said Christy. "If by investing in
this they can invigorate the market for high-end personal
computers, it's certainly in Intel's best interests to do that."
</P>
<P>
The new business has been operating on a trial basis since
February at an existing Portland facility with customers such as
Nasdaq.com and Golf Magazine.

<HEADLINE> Dell Reports 21 Percent Profit Growth, 31 Percent Revenue Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Dell Computer Corp., the
world's second largest personal computer maker, Thursday reported
a 21-percent rise in profit and 31-percent increase in revenues
for the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Round Rock, Tex.-based company said its net income was 525
million U.S. dollars, or 19 cents per share, during the first
quarter ended April 28. That's up 21 percent from 434 million
dollars, or 16 cents per share, during the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Revenue rose to 7.3 billion dollars, up 31 percent from 5.5
billion dollars during last year's fiscal first-quarter.
</P>
<P>
James Schneider, Dell's chief financial officer, attributed the
strong showing to better-than-expected sales to businesses, lower
operating costs and stable prices for computer parts.
</P>
<P>
Corporate purchasing picked up after a slowdown in late 1999 as
companies focused on preparing for potential disruptions from the
year 2000 date change, he said.
</P>
<P>
Dell's sales were particularly strong in the U.S., rising 35
percent from last year. Sales also were strong in Asia, coming in
47 percent higher, according to news release from the company.
</P>
<P>
Dell's European business, however, continued to be sluggish,
growing at only 17 percent. But Dell Vice Chairman Kevin Rollins
said that the company's sales to Europe, which has been a trouble
spot for most PC makers in recent quarters, will gain parity with
its broader business by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
In a conference call Thursday evening, Dell executives told
analysts to expect to see an increasing amount of the company's
earnings coming from gains on investments in the current quarter.
</P>
<P>
"The fundamental competitive advantages of our customer-focused
direct business model are widening," said Michael S. Dell, the
company's chairman and chief executive. "That's particularly true
in the server and storage products at the heart of the Internet
infrastructure."
</P>
<P>
The company also said it has expanded revenue and profitability
beyond its base computer systems. Worldwide services sales topped
500 million dollars for the first time during the quarter, an
increase of more than 50 percent.

<HEADLINE> Two-Thirds of Americans On-line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Sixty-four percent of Americans
aged 12 or older have used the Internet in the past year,
according to a research released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Almost half of these Internet users, or 31 percent of all U.S.
residents aged 12 or older, report going on-line everyday, said U.
S. market analysis firm ACNielsen.
</P>
<P>
The firm's survey of nearly 40,000 individuals found that while
using e-mail is the most common Internet-related activity, cited
by 86 percent of Internet users, nearly half have purchased a
product or service online.
</P>
<P>
On top of the items purchased online are books, CDs, computer
software, travel-related services, clothing and apparel, specialty
gift items, computer hardware and entertainment services.
</P>
<P>
Only 13 percent of the Internet users, or approximately 4
percent of the U.S. population aged 12 or older say they have
purchased a grocery or drug product online.
</P>
<P>
But ACNielsen expects that to change over the next five years
as Internet grocery shopping becomes more widely available. The
most frequently mentioned reason for purchasing a grocery or drug
product online was saving money, edging out convenience-related
reason such as the ability to shop anytime of day or night and
home delivery.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that nearly 70 percent of Internet users
go online most often at home, 17 percent at work, 7 percent at
school and 2 percent at a library. Forty-four percent of Internet
users are online an hour or more in an average day when they use
the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Thai Central Bank Steps in to Defend Falling Baht </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand (BOT), the
Thai central bank, has intervened in the offshore foreign exchange
market to prop up the baht which has broken its psychological
support level of 39 against the U.S. dollar, the Nation newspaper
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the central bank's intervention, the baht bounced
back to 38.88 against the greenback after plunging to 39.09 on
Thursday, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time in several months that the central bank
has stepped in to calm market jitters, as the country continues to
face a wave of capital outflows.
</P>
<P>
"The BOT move was significant as we have not seen the central
bank participates in market for months. The move told us that the
market was so volatile that measures were needed to stabilize it,"
an analyst at a local bank said.
</P>
<P>
Thai central bank's Assistant Governor Chetthavee Chareonpitak
told reporters the baht weakness, which was in line with other
regional currencies, was due to external factors and the selling
of shares in the stock market.

WASHINGTON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Portland Trail Blazers defeated
Utah Jazz 103-84 on Thursday to lead best-of-seven series 3-0.
</P>
<P>
Portland built a 21-point first-half lead, blew it, then
regrouped to pull away in the fourth quarter, empty the Delta

</P>
<P>
Steve Smith scored 14 of his 21 points in the first quarter,
finishing with 6-of-11 shots and adding six assists. Bonzi Wells,

<HEADLINE> Lazio Soccer Fans Riot in Central Rome  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Italian soccer club Lazio's fans,
angry at a controversial refereeing decision that could deprive
their team of the Serie A title, clashed repeatedly with police in
central Rome Thursday, hurling missiles including eggs, stones and
molotov cocktails, and attacking police cars with iron bars and
rocks.
</P>
<P>
Italian news agency Ansa reported that the police, who some say
may have exacerbated the situation with heavy-handed tactics, were
not the only victims of the fans' wrath.
</P>
<P>
Motorists blocked by protests fled in panic as the hooligans
descended on their cars, wrecked windows and denting bodywork with
rocks taken from a building site.
</P>
<P>
The reason for all the mayhem was a disallowed goal on Sunday
that would have put Lazio level on points with championship
leaders Juventus.
</P>
<P>
It was not the first time Lazio think they have been penalized
in the the final stages of a championship - they still point to a
blatant penalty not awarded in their favour in the penultimate
match of last year's championship, in which they were overtaken at
the last gasp by AC Milan.
</P>
<P>
Two Lazio fans had to be hospitalized while others limped off,
licking their wounds.
</P>
<P>
But the battle was not over yet. The Lazio fans headed off to
the headquarters of the Italian Referees' Association (AIA), not
far away, attacking a police car with sticks and iron bars along
the way.
</P>
<P>
The flood of rioting fans had by now paralyzed traffic in the
center, and the unlucky motorists - some of whom had applauded the
fans hours earlier - now became the victims of their fury.
</P>
<P>
After stocking up at a building site, the hooligans started
throwing rocks at the blocked cars, some of which were left
stranded as terrified occupants ran for cover.

<P>
BRASILIA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Marcelo Ramos scored two goals for
Palmeiras of Brazil in their 3-1 victory over Uruguay's Penarol in
Sao Paulo to move on to quarter-finals of the Libertadores Cup.
</P>
<P>
Because Palmeiras lost 2-0 in their earlier meeting with
Penarol the game had to go to penalty kicks to decide which team
would advance with Palmeiras winning 3-2.
</P>
<P>
Palmeiras scored the first three goals of the match. After
Nenem's tally in the 25th minute, Ramos scored in the 45th and
55th minutes.
</P>
<P>
Penarol got on the board in the 61st minute on a goal by
Pacheco, forcing the penalty kick shootout.
</P>
<P>
Palmeiras later squandered a chance for a goal on a penalty
kick that Euller shot off the post.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Help Fight Arsenic Problems in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government has agreed in
principle to carry out a detailed study on the ground water
development of deep aquifers for safe drinking water supply to
seriously arsenic-affected areas of Bangladesh, The New Nation
newspaper reported here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The study at a cost of 275 million taka (5.5 million U.S.
dollars) will be undertaken by Japan International Cooperation
Agency in close cooperation with Bangladesh's Department of Public
Health and Engineering, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In pursuance of the program, the Japanese government dispatched
a 10-member team to Bangladesh on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The objectives of the study will be to formulate the master
plan for development of ground water resources of arsenic-affected
areas, to conduct pre-feasibility study on priority project and to
transfer technology to counterpart personnel in the course of
study.
</P>
<P>
According to a United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) survey
released early this year, some 21 to 24 million Bangladeshi people
are potentially at risk due to high doses of arsenic contents in
tube well waters.
</P>
<P>
A two-day international conference on groundwater arsenic
contamination will be held here Saturday under the auspices of the
UNICEF, the Government of Bangladesh and some non-government
organizations, aiming at sharing experiences and finding future
directions for addressing the serious problem, The Daily Star
reported.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid has suggested opening up direct air links between Indonesia
and China to attract more tourists and enhance the two countries'
economic relationship, a local newspaper said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Observer daily quoted Chairman of the
Association of Indonesia-China Economic, Social and Cultural
Cooperation Sukamdani Sahid Gitosardjono as saying the president
suggested opening flight routes from Batam (Indonesia's tourists
destination island) and Jakarta to Shanghai and Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"The main target is to attract more tourists from China to come
to Indonesia," Gitosardjono said.
</P>
<P>
With the opening of the routes people from Indonesia would not
need to go to Singapore en route to China, he said, adding trade
and industrial relationships between the two countries have been
running well.
</P>
<P>
"That is why the prime target of the suggestion is to enhance
cooperation in the tourism sector," he said, citing Chinese-
Indonesian's role in the country's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
He further revealed that a delegation from China is due to come
to Indonesia by next month. "They are expected to take a keen
interest in investing in Indonesia."

<HEADLINE> International Community Calls for Early End to Hostage Crisis in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Countries that took the
floor at an emergency Security Council meeting on Sierra Leone on
Thursday night called for an early end to the current hostage
crisis in Sierra Leone, and held those who are responsible
accountable.
</P>
<P>
They also called on the international community to continue to
offer various kinds of emergency assistance to the U.N.
peacekeeping force in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) in order to prevent
the U.N. peacekeeping operations in the West African nation from
failure.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yingfan, Chinese permanent representative to the United
Nations and this month's council president, told the meeting that
he "is deeply concerned over the deteriorating situation in Sierra
Leone." The meeting was called at the request of African
countries.
</P>
<P>
"We support the international community, particularly the
relevant countries and regional organizations, in their efforts to
defuse the crisis in Sierra Leone. We appreciate the work by the
(U.N.) Secretariat in this regard, and we appeal to the
international community to continue to provide various kinds of
emergency assistance to the UNAMSIL," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said, "Let us not fail Sierra
Leone. Let us not fail Africa."
</P>
<P>
"This time, in this crisis, let us back words with deeds, and
mandates with the resources needed to make them work," he said.
</P>
<P>
The current hostage crisis in Sierra Leone is being closely
watched not only in Africa, but also in the other parts of the
world simply because the success or failure of the U.N. peace
efforts in Sierra Leone would have broader impact on the current
and future U.N. peacekeeping operations in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ibrahim Kamara, the Sierra Leonean permanent
representative to the United Nations, said, "Much has been said
about the impact which these latest events in Sierra Leone could
have on the future of United Nations peacekeeping efforts in
Africa and other parts of the world."
</P>
<P>
"It is the view of my government that it is about the time we
move ahead. It is about the time we move ahead because the
situation in Sierra Leone is still serious," he said.
</P>
<P>
The statement was echoed by Steward Eldon, the British deputy
permanent representative to the United Nations. He said, "The
situation in Sierra Leone is very serious," and "the present
tragic breakdown could have dire consequences."
</P>
<P>
"If the response of the U.N. and the international community
does not match up to the challenge, the consequences will be far-
reaching -- not just for Sierra Leone, but for Africa, U.N.
peacekeeping and the U.N. itself," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Council meeting was convened as the United Nations is
reinforcing its peacekeeping force in Sierra Leone, with two
Jordanian parachute companies comprising 240 soldiers and a 31-
member medical unit expected to fly to Freetown's Lungi airport
within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
In Freetown, the United Nations peacekeeping force announced
Thursday that two U.N. military personnel held by the rebel
Revolutionary United Front in eastern Sierra Leone had been
released.
</P>
<P>
About 8,700 U.N. peacekeepers arrived in Sierra Leone last
month to replace a Nigerian-led West African intervention force,
known as ECOMOG, that helped disarm the rebels as part of a peace
accord that ended an eight-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. mission quickly began to unravel after the rebels took
hostage about 500 U.N. personnel, mostly Zambian, in Sierra Leone
early this month.
</P>
<P>
"My delegation welcomes current initiatives to strengthen
UNAMSIL through the rapid deployment of additional troops," said
the Sierra Leonean ambassador.
</P>
<P>
Voldoymyr Yel'Chenko, the Ukrainian permanent representative to
the United Nations, said, "We maintain that the responsibility for
such state of affairs lies entirely with the Revolutionary United
Front and its leadership. We also strongly condemn the hostile
actions against United Nations peacekeepers, which are absolutely
unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
At the moment, he added, "ensuring safety and security of the
peacekeeping personnel in Sierra Leone is of utmost importance."
</P>
<P>
Representatives from Algeria, Malaysia, Tunisia, India, Jordan
and Russia said that the crisis cast a shadow on the U.N.
commitment to peace in Africa, and the Security Council should
take tough action, face decisively the challenge and uphold the
credibility of the world body.

<P>
TIRANA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Albania on Thursday urged the United
States to play "an active role" in helping Albania push forward
its ongoing army restructuring.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by Albanian President Rexep Meidani and
Prime Minister Ilir Meta during their separate meetings with a U.S.

structures.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Major General Joseph Garret, head of the U.S.

WASHINGTON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton said
he is sending civil rights leader Jesse Jackson to Sierra Leone as
a special envoy to help resolve the crisis in the western African
nation.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Clinton said he talked with United Nations
Secretary General Kofi Annan on Thursday, and they agreed that "
the situation there has been grave."
</P>
<P>
"I have asked Rev. Jesse Jackson, my special envoy for
Democracy in Africa, to return to the region to work with leaders
there for a peaceful resolution of this crisis."
</P>
<P>
"Rev. Jackson has been actively involved in our diplomatic
effort to help the people of Sierra Leone realize their peaceful
aspirations," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he and Annan agreed that a stronger international
response was necessary to restore peace in Sierra Leone and to
prevent a return to "all-out civil war."

"We intend to support the commitment West African nations have
made to send additional troops to Sierra Leone to restore peace,"
Clinton said.

United Nations, made the appeal at an open Security Council
meeting on the current hostage crisis in the west African country
of Sierra Leone. The meeting was held at the request of the
African group of states in the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese delegation is deeply concerned over the
deteriorating situation in Sierra Leone," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
"We support the international community, particularly the
relevant countries and regional organizations, in their efforts to
defuse the crisis in Sierra Leone. We appreciate the work by the
(U.N.) Secretariat in this regard, and we appeal to the
international community to continue to provide various kinds of
emergency assistance to the UNAMSIL," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
"Like other delegations, we believe that the Security Council
should adopt appropriate measures vis-a-vis the situation in
Sierra Leone, including reviewing the mandate of the UNAMSIL and
taking measures to ensure that its authorization is implemented in
real terms," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador made the statement as the United Nations
is reinforcing its peacekeeping force in Sierra Leone, with two
Jordanian parachute companies comprising 240 soldiers and a 31-
member medical unit expected to fly to Freetown's Lungi airport
within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
In Freetown, the United Nations peacekeeping force announced
Thursday that two U.N. military personnel held by the RUF rebels
in eastern Sierra Leone had been released.
</P>
<P>
About 8,700 U.N. peacekeepers arrived in Sierra Leone last
month to replace a Nigerian-led west African intervention force,
known as ECOMOG, that helped disarm the rebels as part of a peace
accord that ended an eight-year-long civil war.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. mission quickly began to unravel after the rebels took
hostage about 500 U.N. personnel, most of them Zambians, in Sierra
Leone earlier this month.

<HEADLINE> Growth Gap Widened Between North, South Italy in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The economic growth gap between
northern and southern Italy widened in 1999, according to figures
released Thursday by Svimez, a government agency for development
in the south.
</P>
<P>
Svimez, in a preview of its annual report due in July, said
that last year, entire Italy's GDP grew 1.4 percent, with a
slightly higher rate of 1.5 percent for the central and northern
regions, while the south managed only a growth of 1.1 percent, 0.2
percent lower than that of 1998.
</P>
<P>
But it noted that the southern region of Basilicata's economy
rose an impressive 8.1 percent over the previous year, as a result
of an "exceptional" boom in the production of means of transport.
</P>
<P>
Of the three regions which showed negative growth, two were in
the south, Sicily and Molise, with growth down 0.1 percent, but
the northern region of Valle D'Aosta fared worse, with its economy
shrinking 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Svimez also highlighted the flood of jobless southerners who
left their homes in 1999 to seek jobs in the north or further
afield.
</P>
<P>
It said that 87,000 people emigrated from the south last year,
compared to 70,000 in 1998, confirming a trend that began in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Human Trafficking Turns More Serious in Albania: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The trafficking in women and girls,
a violation of women's rights, has become a more serious social
problem in Albania, the Albanian Telegraphic Agency (ATA) reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In Lezhe area, Western Albania, which has a good sea
geographical position, this trafficking has been on a marked rise,
according to a survey conducted by the Advising Center for Women
and Girls in cooperation with Intersos and ECHO organizations, the
ATA said.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that about 72 percent of those interviewed
confirmed that many girls from their districts had been forcibly
sent to neighboring countries, Italy and Greece.
</P>
<P>
Local sociologists believed that the trafficking in women and
girls is deeply rooted because women and girls are considered to
as creatures without rights and totally dependent on a dominant
male. Such mentality has become worse as a result of serious
social and economic problems over recent years, according to the
ATA.

<HEADLINE> Annan Demands Immediate, Unconditional Release of All U.N. Staff in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Thursday night demanded "the immediate and unconditional
release" of all U.N. personnel in Sierra Leone, and Foday Sankoh,
leader of the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) is
responsible for the current hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
Annan made the statement at an open Security Council meeting,
which began on Thursday night as several hundred U.N. peacekeepers-
- the great majority of them Zambians -- are still being detained
in various parts of the West African nation.
</P>
<P>
"I demand the immediate and unconditional release of all
United Nations personnel -- and I think all those, in particular
the leaders of neighboring countries, who are working to secure
the outcome."
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, two U.N. military personnel was freed by the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
The current hostage crisis "is deplorable and unacceptable"
because the RUF, who signed a peace accord last July, not only
interfered with the disarmament process under the peace agreement,
but arbitrarily detain members of the United Nations peacekeeping
force in Sierra Leone, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Once again I would remind Mr. Sankoh that he is responsible
for the action of forces under his command," he said, "He will be
held accountable for their actions, and for the safety and well-
being of all those who have been detained."
</P>
<P>
Against the backdrop that the U.N. peacekeepers were attacked
by one of the parties to the peace agreement before the end of its
proper deployment, "we have to consolidate and reinforce our
troops so that they can defend themselves and their mandate
effectively, and so they can help stabilize the situation," Annan
said.
</P>
<P>
"I am glad to say the additional troops are on their way,
including units with battle experience and with combat equipment,
such as artillery and helicopter gun-ships," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Fred Eckhard, the U.N. spokesman, told a press
conference that the United Nations is beefing up its peacekeeping
troops in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
"Two Jordanian parachute companies, comprising about 240
troops, supported by a 31-strong medical unit are expected to fly
to Lungi airport in Sierra Leone within 48 hours," Eckhard said, "
The remainder of the Jordanian battalion is expected to be ready
to be deployed by the end of the month."
</P>
<P>
A second Indian battalion is now ready for deployment on
Monday, he said, "The Indians have also offered one mechanized
unit, one special forces unit and one attack helicopter unit. The
Bangladesh battalion is also expected to be deployed next week."
</P>
<P>
However, Annan reminded the 15-nation Security Council of
logistical difficulties.
</P>
<P>
"The logistical difficulties we face should not be
underestimated," he said, "Our logistics staff are working very
hard. They have arranged at very short notice for some 120-150
flights into Freetown's Lungi airport, using a variety of aircraft
to bring troops, equipment and supplies from several different
countries."
</P>
<P>
The airlifts are being arranged with the assistance of Canada,
the Netherlands, Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The current hostage crisis is closely watched not only in
Africa, but also in other parts of the world because the failure
of U.N. peacekeeping operations in Sierra Leone, suffering the
bloody eight-year civil war, would have ripple effect on the U.N.
peace efforts in the Democratic Republic of Congo and other
African countries.
</P>
<P>
"Let us not fail Sierra Leone," Annan said, "Let us not fail
Africa."
</P>
<P>
"This time, in this crisis, let us back words with deeds, and
mandates with the resources needed to make them work."

CHENGDU, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Technologies of the
United States has donated 100,000 yuan (12,000 U.S. dollars) to
the Chengdu Giant Panda Breeding Research Center in southwest
China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
Karl Krapek, CEO and president of United Technologies,
presented the donation to Zhang Hemin, director of the research
center on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the donation represents his staff' affection for the
cute creature and their support to the center's research and
protection of giant pandas.
</P>
<P>
He said his company is not only doing business in China, but
also has the obligation to care for the country's endangered
animals.
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, the company established a joint venture with
the Chengdu Engine Group Corp. LTD and the Second Group Company of
China Aviation Industries. The venture has been operating well.
</P>
<P>
Last year, United Technologies' "cooperation investment" to
China amounted to 300 million U.S. dollars, establishing more than
20 joint ventures or cooperative projects and launching
scholarships in eight prestigious Chinese universities such as
Qinghua and Tongji.
</P>
<P>
The 30-hectare Chengdu Giant Panda Breeding Research Center is
located at the Wolong Nature Reserve in the northern suburbs of
Chengdu. It was created by the Chinese government and the World
Wildlife Fund (WWF) in 1980 and has successfully bred 24 giant
pandas since 1991, of which 15 survived. There are only about 1,
000 giant pandas, both in captivity and in the wild, in the world,
80 percent of which live in the mountainous areas of Sichuan.

TIANJIN, May 12 (Xinhua) -- North China's Tianjin Municipality
plans to invest one billion yuan in building garbage disposal
centers in the next five years to improve its garbage treatment
system.
</P>
<P>
With the investment, four large-scale modern garbage disposal
plants will be built and another five existing plants will be

totaling 5,500 tons daily, and the rate is increasing by four
percent annually.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the mounting garbage output, the city's garbage
disposal system still remains poor.
</P>
<P>
The city has built a garbage tip at a cost of 120 million yuan,
which is designed to treat 2,700 tons of garbage daily, about one
half of the daily garbage volume in Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the city plans to finish a special garbage disposal
plant by the end of this year. Another large garbage tip and a
garbage incineration and power-generating plant are also being
planned.

<P>
NANJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province has
invested 13 billion yuan (about 1.56 billion U.S. dollars) in
recent years to boost its telecommunications development.
</P>
<P>
A local official said the funds were used to raise the number
of telephone subscribers.
</P>
<P>
So far, there are ten million telephone subscribers in the
province, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu has set up a telecommunication network based on 55,000-
km optical fiber cable lines, which link the provincial capital of
Nanjing with cities, counties, towns and villages across the
province, he said.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that Jiangsu's telephone subscribers
have risen by one million each year over the past five years. The
increase places Jiangsu as a leading figure in handling capacity
of public switchboards in China.

<HEADLINE> Individual Loans Increase in Tianjin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, May 12 (Xinhua) -- " Realize today's dream with
tomorrow's money" is no longer just an advertisement for borrowing
loan from banks. Many people in north China's Tianjin Municipality
are actually doing so.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Li, a local resident, borrowed 170,000 yuan (about 20,400 U.
S. dollars) from the China Construction Bank Tianjin Branch to buy
a house of more than 160 sq. m. just before he got married last
year.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Li and his wife will have to pay back some 1,900 yuan every
month, nearly half of their monthly income, but it is worthwhile,
they said, as the loan not only enables them to move into such a
spacious house, but it also paid for the interior decoration and
their wedding ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Borrowing from the State financial institutions is more
convenient and trouble saving than from close friends, Li said,
adding that their salaries will very likely go up in the future,
which will lessen the burden of repayment.
</P>
<P>
Chinese people used to be reluctant to borrow money. They would
rather rely on themselves, and many of them lived thriftily their
whole life, saving every penny, seldom having any spare cash for
entertainment. Many children in poor areas had to drop out of
school. Others had no opportunity to attend school at all.
</P>
<P>
The younger generation are trying another way of living. They
would like to repay loans later to satisfy their present needs,
said officials in financial affairs.
</P>
<P>
Most banks in China now grant loans in nine sectors including
housing, tourism, medical treatment, education, and overseas
studies.
</P>
<P>
However, there is still a gap between China and foreign
countries in loan consumption. Related statistics show that in
China, individual loans account for only one to two percent of the
total. The figure in foreign countries is twenty to thirty percent.
</P>
<P>
Individual loans will not only lessen financial risks for banks,
but will also inspire domestic demand. Individual loans also
brings more opportunities for the auto and construction industries
as quite a number of citizens use the money to buy either houses
or cars, said one managing staff with the Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) Tianjin Branch.
</P>
<P>
The ICBC Tianjin Branch granted 1.56 billion yuan of loans by
the end of 1999, benefiting 8,589 families. Altogether 70.74
million yuan of the bank loan enabled 775 local citizens to buy
their own cars.
</P>
<P>
Economists share a positive prediction that the real-name bank
deposit system implemented nationwide on April 1 this year will
further spur the increase of individual loan consumption.

<HEADLINE> Operation Brings Rain to Dry Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- China has successfully brought rain
to north of the Yangtze River, one of the areas hardest hit by
this spring's drought by seeding clouds, China Daily quoted a
source with the China Meteorological Administration as saying.
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday, a considerable amount of rainfall, ranging from
15 to 40 millimeters, was reported in more than 10 provinces
across North, East and Central China, helping ease the severe
drought in parts of Henan, Shandong and Gansu provinces.
</P>
<P>
However, the rain did little to the driest areas in North and
Northwest China.
</P>
<P>
The seeding operation, conducted on Tuesday and Wednesday,
reportedly was one of the largest successfully conducted over a
large area.
</P>
<P>
Seeding clouds to produce rain has been widely used in China to
help drought-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, approximately 200 million yuan (24 million U.S.
dollars) were budgeted for such operations.
</P>
<P>
The drought is the main threat to China's summer harvest, which
is expected to yield 25 per cent of the nation's grain output this
year.

</P>
<P>
Hua Zefei, deputy general manager of the Yunnan Horti-Expo

According to the deputy general manager, the company has
achieved remarkable earnings since the horticultural garden opened
to visitors as of May 1, last year.
</P>
<P>
During the eight exhibiting months last year, the garden earned
390 million yuan from selling the gate tickets. It also pocketed
over 10 million yuan from a souvenir known as "visa for the
passport on visiting the World Horti-Expo".
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the garden entertained almost 300,000 visitors
between April 10-May 10 this year.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan is one of the largest tourism destinations in China and
local officials hope the proposed listing of the company will help

<HEADLINE> More Troops to Fly to Sierra Leone to Bolster U.N. Peacekeepers </HEADLINE>

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations is
reinforcing its peacekeeping force in Sierra Leone, with two
Jordanian parachute companies comprising 240 soldiers and a 31-
member medical unit expected to fly to Freetown's Lungi airport
within 48 hours, a U.N. spokesman said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Fred Eckhard, the U.N. spokesman, told a press conference that
U.N. reconnaissance flights "do not show the RUF (the rebel
Revolutionary United Front) in an organized position ready to
pounce on Freetown," the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
"The remainder of the Jordanian battalion is expected to be
ready to be deployed by the end of the month," he said. "A second
Indian battalion is now ready for deployment on Monday. The
Indians have also offered one mechanized unit, one special forces
unit and one attack helicopter unit."
</P>
<P>
"The Bangladesh battalion is also expected to be deployed next
week," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The airlifts are being arranged with the assistance of Canada,
the Netherlands, Russia and the United States," he said, "Supplies
are also on their way as part of efforts to reinforce the mission.
"
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United Nations is recalling back to Sierra Leone
some of the civilian and humanitarian staff relocated to Banjul,
capital of Gambia, Conakry, capital of Guinea, in light of new
humanitarian requirements, he said. "Exact numbers of returning
staff are not yet available."
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Leonean Government and U.N. troops had been involved
in skirmishes with the rebels but the "tensions in Freetown has
reduced somewhat and of course in the meantime we get stronger
every day," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"Are we comfortable? No," he said, "We are coping."
</P>
<P>
In Freetown, the United Nations peacekeeping force announced
Thursday that two U.N. military personnel held by the RUF rebels
in eastern Sierra Leone had been released.
</P>
<P>
"Major Suresh Karki, a Nepalese Military Observer serving with
the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL), arrived
Thursday at the U.N. Mission headquarters in Freetown after being
released Wednesday in the eastern part of the country by members
of the Revolutionary United Front," said a UNAMSIL statement.
</P>
<P>
"Major Karki, who has been suffering from malaria, was released
by the RUF in order to receive medical treatment," the statement
said, "Lance Corporal Paucho Singh Chouan, a member of the Indian
contingent, was also released, unconditionally."
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Thursday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said
here that the United Nations is determined to carry out the
peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone, or it will have a very
serious impact on the world efforts to seek peace in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters upon his arrival at the U.N. Headquarters
in New York, Annan said, "I don't think there was ever a question
of withdrawal. I think we have a mandate and we are determined to
carry it out."
</P>
<P>
"I think we should also look at the broader implications," he
said, "If the international community were to fail the Sierra
Leoneans and were to fail in Sierra Leone the impact on broader
efforts by the international community on the African continent
will be very serious, and not only there but in other areas."
</P>
<P>
"I think given some of the lessons we have learned, we should
try and see this one through," he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan made the statement as the international community is
fearing that failure in Sierra Leone would have ripple effect on
the U.N. efforts to bring 5,500-strong peacekeeping forces into
the Democratic Republic of Congo, where six African countries have
been involved in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
About 8,700 U.N. peacekeepers arrived in Sierra Leone last
month to replace a Nigerian-led West African intervention force,
known as ECOMOG, that helped disarm the rebels as part of a peace
accord that ended an eight-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. mission quickly began to unravel after the rebels took
hostage about 500 U.N. personnel in Sierra Leone. Some 500 of the
U.N. peacekeeping force in Sierra Leone, known as UNAMSIL, are
still being held by RUF rebels. Most of them are Zambians.

<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of two foreign
organizations have praised China for the progress it has made in
protecting intellectual property (IP) rights, China Daily reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation and the
State Intellectual Property Office were hailed for their work with
the European Union-China Intellectual Property Rights Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"The officials involved in the cooperation have been very
competent and dedicated to intellectual property rights protection,
" said Theresa Grace Dunphy, co-director of the European project.
</P>
<P>
"Intellectual property rights protection, which was seen as a
mere foreign issue for most Chinese a few years ago, has become a
deep concern of both foreign and domestic firms," Dunphy said.
</P>
<P>
Richard J Ellings, president of the U.S.-based National Bureau
of Asian Research, expressed his agreement.
</P>
<P>
China's cooperation with other foreign organizations in
intellectual property rights protection has changed from simply
combating pirated cassettes and compact disc to digital rights
management, Ellings said.
</P>
<P>
Based on his experience, Ellings said that working in a
cooperative manner rather than confronting China, will help both
sides achieve greater progress.

<HEADLINE> Tyson May Fight in Scotland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- A decision on whether Mike Tyson can
fight in Scotland could be made early next week, his promoters
have announced.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Sports Network, owned by the fighter's European
promoter Frank Warren, said negotiations were still on-going but
should be finalized soon.
</P>
<P>
Glasgow stadiums Parkhead, home to Celtic Football Club, and
Hampden Park are both vying for the right to stage the fight - due
to take place next month - which would see Tyson facing Lou
Savarese.
</P>
<P>
Ibrox was also in the running to stage the bout, but was ruled
out when a suitable date could not be found.
</P>
<P>
Sports Network spokesman Richard Maynard said venues further
afield were still being considered and added: "We are also looking
at other venues in Europe as well so it may not take place in
Glasgow."
</P>
<P>
He said: "We are looking to hopefully have it finalized by the
beginning of next week - Monday or Tuesday - whether he will be
coming here or not."
</P>
<P>
Tyson, who has a rape conviction dating from 1992, could also
face immigration problems which might prevent the fight going
ahead in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Immigration laws ban foreign nationals who have convictions for
major crimes from entering the country, and Tyson was only able to
attend a fight in Manchester earlier this year after being given
special dispensation from Home Secretary Jack Straw.
</P>
<P>
At the time Straw hinted that the permit was merely a one-off
and the former heavyweight champion would be refused a work permit
if he tried to fight in Britain again.

<HEADLINE> Robson Furious at Gascoigne "Down Under" Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer club
Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson has furiously dismissed claims
that midfielder Paul Gascoigne is on his way to Australia in a bid
to resurrect his career.
</P>
<P>
Reports that the 32-year-old former England star is to join
Western Australia Soccer League side Joondalup City in Perth on
loan sparked a media frenzy, but Robson and Gascoigne's agent Mel
Stein were both astonished by the story.
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe what I was hearing this morning," admitted
Robson. "I was sitting having my breakfast watching Sky Sports
News when this guy came on and did a 10-minute interview about one
of my players.
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe what the guy was coming out with and all I
can hear is him saying that negotiations are at an advanced stage
between Middlesbrough and his club," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I have never even heard of them, let alone talked to them. I
have no idea what all this is about, but the guy has done a 10-
minute interview on the strength of an agreement he supposedly has
with us when we've not spoken to him or anyone about what Paul may
do in the summer.
</P>
<P>
"I rang my chief executive (Keith Lamb) to see if he was
watching the same programme because I couldn't believe what I was
watching.
</P>
<P>
"The first thing Paul has to do is to get fit. When he does
that, then we will be able to see what the next step is.
</P>
<P>
"He has a year left on his contract here and we have not spoken
about the future. We will sit down after coming back from Libya
and discuss the best way forward," he added.
</P>
<P>
Stein too was at a loss to explain where the claims came from.
</P>
<P>
"It's nonsense. Middlesbrough know nothing about it, they have
had no approaches, I have had no approaches and Paul has had no
contact with anyone."
</P>
<P>
"I have not spoken to any representative of Joondalup City and
I couldn't without the permission of Middlesbrough Football Club.
Until we have actually spoken to anybody and seen what is on the
table, Paul will be going nowhere, and we can't do that without
Middlesbrough giving us their permission," he said.
</P>
<P>
The denials are in stark contrast to the claims of Joondalup
spokesman Paul Simmons, who was confident that a deal could be
arranged.
</P>
<P>
"We are still sorting out the contract details," he said. "We
are towards the end of negotiations. How big is this for
Australian soccer?
</P>
<P>
"One of the biggest names in the world game is coming to play
for the Western Australian State champions."
</P>
<P>
Robson admitted last week that he would have no objection to
Gascoigne going out on loan over the summer to regain full fitness,
and there were suggestions that he could be heading for
Scandinavia.
</P>
<P>
However, Stein hit back at claims in the wake of Robson's
comments that no-one wanted him.
</P>
<P>
"He was never going to Norway, but after those reports, I had
three clubs on the phone asking about him," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gascoigne's future has been the subject of feverish speculation
in recent months as the troubled star reaches yet another
crossroads in his tempestuous career.
</P>
<P>
He has started just 44 games for Boro since his 3.45 million
pounds move from Glasgow Rangers in March 1998, and only nine of
them this season.
</P>
<P>
The former Newcastle, Spurs and Lazio player is undoubtedly one
of the most naturally talented English footballers of his
generation, but injuries and off-the-field problems have blighted
his career.
</P>
<P>
Just two years ago, he was a genuine contender for Glenn Hoddle
's World Cup finals squad, and many believe that his exclusion
from the party for France 98, coupled with the split from his wife
Sheryl, are partly to blame for his downfall.
</P>
<P>
Stress and alcohol-related problems saw him voluntarily seek
medical help last season, and although he worked hard to regain
his fitness during the summer, further injuries have hampered his
progress.
</P>
<P>
He has not played for the Teessiders since breaking his arm in
a rash challenge on Aston Villa's George Boateng on February 14,
although it is a thigh strain which has prevented his
participation in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
Robson is one of Gascoigne's biggest fans, but he has a healthy
transfer kitty for the summer and he has already been linked with
Real Madrid's Christian Karembeu, Fiorentina's Paul Okon and
Everton's Don Hutchison, and success on the market in the next few
weeks could dramatically increase the competition in midfield,
where Paul Ince and Christian Ziege are already producing the
goods for their manager.

<HEADLINE> Czechs Continue Lead, U.S. Crash out in Hockey Quarterfinals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions the Czech
Republic continued their lead in the quarterfinals Thursday in St.
Petersburg, while the United States' medal hope was shattered
after losing to Slovakia 4-1.
</P>
<P>
The Czechs, who defeated Latvia 3-1, will face Canada in the
semifinals Friday. The Canadians trounced Switzerland 5-3.
</P>
<P>
Slovakia will confront the Finns, who posted a 2-1 victory over
rival Sweden.
</P>
<P>
The Slovaks, who arrived in St. Petersburg without four top NHL
forwards and after leading defenseman Lubomir Sekeras dropped out
for a concussion in the previous game, scored three quick goals
early in the second period.
</P>
<P>
The Americans, who had a unbeaten string in previous matches of
the championship, had an equal strength goal at 03:55 minutes into
the game, but that score stayed unchanged until rival Lubos
Bartecko won a power play goal at 49:04 minutes in the third
period.
</P>
<P>
The current championships, which started April 29 and featured
16 teams, will end on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Euro 2000 Touts Face Severe Punishment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Euro 2000 ticket touts will face
fines of up to 60,000 pounds and be jailed for three years in a
tough clampdown announced by police.
</P>
<P>
According to the BBC report on Thusday, tickets sold to the
general public for next month's European Championships will all
have the name of the buyer printed on them.
</P>
<P>
Police have said they will vigorously check identity papers to
make sure the names on the tickets match.
</P>
<P>
The strong moves have been made to guarantee security inside
the stadiums and avoid ticket scams.
</P>
<P>
A Belgian police statement warned: "Do not buy tickets on the
black market and do not sell your ticket."
</P>
<P>
Only 3 percent of the 1.2 million tickets for the 31 games are
still to be sold for the tournament which starts on 10 June.
</P>
<P>
Ticket scams caused many problems at the World Cup in France in
1998, where thousands of fans on package tours found out tickets
were not available on match day.
</P>
<P>
Fines for ticket touts will range from 600 to 60,000 pounds and
jail terms could be anything from six months to three years.
</P>
<P>
The tournament is being played in four Belgian and four Dutch
stadiums.
</P>
<P>
The opening game between Belgium and Sweden will be held at the
King Baudouin Stadium in Brussels on 10 June while the Euro 2000
final is in Rotterdam on 2 July.

<HEADLINE> Brand, Francis Share Rookie Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Elton Brand and Steve Francis,
the first and second picks of last summer's draft, shared the
National Basketball Association's Rookie of the Year award.
</P>
<P>
It's only the third time a pair of rookies has shared the honor.
Jason Kidd and Grant Hill were co-winners in 1994-95, and Dave
Cowens and Geoff Petrie shared in 1970-71.
</P>
<P>
Brand is the only Chicago Bull besides Michael Jordan to win
the rookie award. Jordan won it in 1984-85.
</P>
<P>
Brand led all rookies in scoring (20.1 points), rebounding (10),
blocked shots (1.63) and minutes (37) per game. He also was tops
in double-doubles (42), and led the entire NBA with 4.3 offensive
rebounds per game.
</P>
<P>
Francis, traded to the Rockets after originally being drafted
by the Vancouver Grizzlies, came on strong the last month of the
season. He scored 30 or more points four times in the last month
of the season, averaging 20.8 points, 6.9 assists and 6.5 rebounds
in April.

finals Sunday after beating Canada and Finland in Friday's
semifinals in St.Petersburg.

The Slovakians, who have competed as an independent country at
the world championships since 1996, have not finished better than
seventh in previous competitions.
</P>
<P>
The loss to Slovakia represented a massive blow to the Finns,
who hope to win gold again after settling for silver the last two
years.They will confront the Canadians for the bronze Sunday

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Flying Ammunition to U.N. Force in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States flew
ammunition to Sierra Leone for Jordanian component of the U.N.
peacekeeping force in the West African country, the State
Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"There's a plane arriving this afternoon in Sierra Leone with
the ammunition for the Jordanian component. We're flying that in
for them. We're willing to do other things," State Department
spokesman Richard Boucher told reporters.
</P>
<P>
What "other things" mean, he said, is that U.S. military
planners and logistics experts were now in Nigeria discussing
details of a possible Nigerian troop deployment in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo said Friday that his
country was prepared to send more troops to Sierra Leone if
required. And Boucher told reporters that "what we're been
discussing is seeing if and how they could go and help augment the
U.N. force."
</P>
<P>
The United States had offered to fly more Bangladeshi troops to
the war-torn West African country when rebels there attacked the
mainly African U.N. force last week, but the United Nations had
turned down that offer because of too expensive cost.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, from the Revolutionary United Front, have captured
hundreds of U.N. soldiers. They tried to advance on the capital,
Freetown, but pro-government forces said Friday that they have
driven them back.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Finance Market Prefers Short-Term Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian finance market
prefers now short-term investments because it is awaiting the U.S.
Federal Reserve to determine the rates of interests to be adopted
in that country.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve meeting will be held Tuesday and meanwhile,
the stock markets will keep wavering.
</P>
<P>
The Sao Paulo Stock Exchange closed Thursday with a 0.44
percent slight increase, while the Nasdaq index rose 2.77 percent
and the Dow Jones industrial average was up 1.91 percent.
</P>
<P>
This was the first positive result of the week in the Sao Paulo
Exchange. The volume of trade reached 731 million dollars, while
the Brazilian financial market is observing the capability of
financing the deficit of foreign accounts.
</P>
<P>
The market wants to know how the Brazilian government will
cover the four percent deficit of the gross domestic product (GDP)
in current accounts because foreign investors have been
disappearing from its stock markets in the last days.

The new project substitutes for a previous one that marked the

A PDVSA spokesman said that the new project has a value of

</P>
<P>
The previous gas project with the same companies for the annual
production of 6.6 million metric tons of liquefied natural gas
failed because of the low prices of the fuel in the international

PDVSA has said that the probable gas reserves in the Paria

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Israel pledged on Friday
that it would continue to cooperate fully with the United Nations
in implementing the resolutions of 425 and 426.
</P>
<P>
David Levy, Foreign Minister of Israel, made the statement
after meeting U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, Levy said during the meeting, the
Secretary-General mentioned positively the full cooperation that
Terje Roed-Larsen, U.N. Special Envoy on Middle East, and his team
received from Israel during their visit.
</P>
<P>
"With the cooperation and implementation of U.N. resolutions,
we see a change in the situation towards tranquillity and calmness
and in the situation that Lebanon returns to promise," Levy said.
</P>
<P>
"I also proposed to the Secretary-General that he visit our
region and the region involved in order to demonstrate the
importance," the Foreign Minister added.
</P>
<P>
Israel informed the United Nations last month that It had
decided to withdraw its troops from Southern Lebanon by July 2000.
Israel also promised that it would cooperate fully with the United
Nations in implementing the resolutions of 425 and 426 of 1978.
</P>
<P>
Resolution 425 called for "strict respect for the territorial
integrity , sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon
within its internationally recognized boundaries" and called upon
"Israel immediately to cease its military action against Lebanese
territory."
</P>
<P>
It also sets out the U.N.'s role, "in light of the request of
the Government of Lebanon," by establishing an "interim force for
southern Lebanon for the purpose of confirming the withdrawal of
Israeli forces, restoring international peace and security and
assisting the Government of Lebanon in ensuring the return of its
effective authority in the area.'
</P>
<P>
In Resolution 426, the Security Council approved the Secretary-
General's report on the implementation of the Resolution 425 and
agreed to the establishment of the United Nations Interim Forces
in Lebanon(UNIFIL).
</P>
<P>
Resolution 426 gave UNIFIL a six-month mandate, which has been
regularly renewed at the request of Lebanon since it was first
approved in March 1978.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Federal Ministers Again Call For Granting PNTR Status to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan
Glickman and Treasury Secretary Lawlence Summers have again called
on Congress to grant permanent normal trade relations (PNTR)
status to China.
</P>
<P>
Glickman, in a speech to farmers in Minnesota Friday, said the
relationship with China and granting PNTR with China is "one of
the most pressing issues" facing the United States.
</P>
<P>
He said China, with 1.3 billion people in the middle of
extraordinary change, represents an extraordinary opportunity for
America's farmers and ranchers.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the trade agreement between the U.S. and
China reached last year will make it much easier for U.S. products
to get into the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
The minister estimated that by the year 2005, China's accession
to the WTO and the U.S. PNTR with China will add an additional 2
billion dollars in total American farm exports each year.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to let that opportunity go by," he said.
</P>
<P>
Summers, testifying at a hearing of the House Banking and
Finance Services Committee Thursday, said the American economy
will get great commercial benefits from the PNTR case.
</P>
<P>
"By failing to pass PNTR, we would sacrifice enormous
commercial advantages," he said.
</P>
<P>
Summers noted that even if the U.S. denies PNTR with China, the
country will still be able to join the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Granting PNTR status to China will also promote reforms in
China, he added.
</P>
<P>
The treasury secretary said that PNTR with China will enhance
the U.S. national security interests in the Pacific region.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Principal Financial
Group, a global retirement services leader, has urged the U.S.
Congress to grant permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) status
to China.
</P>
<P>
Norman Sorensen, president of the company, testified Thursday
before the U.S. House Committee on Banking and Financial Services
that granting PNTR to China is the single most important
international trade issue to be considered by the Congress.
</P>
<P>
"If Congress fails to grant PNTR to China and China enters the
World Trade Organization, American financial services companies
will be effectively barred from the China market," Sorensen said.
</P>
<P>
"If PNTR is not approved, under WTO rules China would be able
to continue to block U.S. companies, while eliminating trade
barriers for other countries," he said. "With PNTR, U.S. insurers
and other financial services firms will be able to enter and
expand in China on terms equal with our international competitors.
"
</P>
<P>
As a leading provider of a wide range of financial products
and services globally, the Principal Financial Group is positioned
to serve the future retirement needs of China's vast and diverse
population, a press release of the company said.

<HEADLINE> Cervix Cancer: Major Scourge Among Nigerian Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Cancer of the cervix accounts for 30
percent of all cancers in Nigerian women while cancer of the
ovaries and tubes accounts for between 2 percent and 3 percent
respectively, said a source obtained here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing at the beginning of the "Nigeria Army Officers'
Wives Association (NAOWA) Week 2000 and a seminar on staying
healthy beyond the year 2000" in Lagos Thursday, a leading medical
doctor in the Nigerian army, Colonel I.S. Ejeh, said the figure of
Nigerian women who died of cancer of the cervix was between four
and five times the figures for England and Wales.
</P>
<P>
Ejeh, who described cancer of the cervix as the commonest
malignancy in Nigerian women, also pointed out that 41.7 percent
of African women were afflicted by the disease, compared with 5.7
percent in England.
</P>
<P>
"the risk factors for pre-cancer and cancer of the cervix are
multiple sexual partners, early age of first sexual intercourse,
unstable marital history, high rate of sexually transmitted
diseases, cigarette smoking, low socio-economic status and consort
of a high risk male," said the doctor.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Chief of Army Staff, Major-General Victor Malu,
represented by Colonel T.L. Ashei, urged the NAOWA to sensitize
its members to the dangers presented by "some silent killer
diseases", noting that its theme was in line with the army's
policy of provision of adequate health care facilities for its
troops and members of their families.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Council Supports Annan's Intention to Withdraw UNMOT From Tajikistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council on Friday reiterated its support for the intention of the
Secretary-General to withdraw the U.N. mission from Tajikistan
when its mandate expires on May 15, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the Security Council held an open debate
on the latest situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a presidential statement, the Security Council welcomed the
success achieved in the peace process in Tajikistan with the
completion of implementation of main provisions of the General
Agreement on the Establishment of peace and National Accord in
Tajikistan signed in Moscow in 1997 under the auspices of the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The Council expressed its appreciation for sequential and
persistent efforts of the President of Tajikistan and the
leadership of the Commission on National Reconciliation in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
The Council acknowledged the significant achievement of the
Tajik parties which have managed to overcome many obstacles and to
put their country on the path to peace, national reconciliation
and democracy.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council emphasized that the continued support of
the international community in the post-conflict phase will be
crucial to allowing Tajikistan to sustain and build on the
achievements of the peace process, and to helping it to lay a
durable foundation for a better life for its people.
</P>
<P>
UNMOT was set up in 1994 to assist the Joint Commission,
composed of representatives of the Tajik Government and of the
Tajik Opposition, to monitor the implementation of the Agreement
on a Temporary Ceasefire and the Cessation of Other Hostile Acts
on the Tajik-Afghan Border and within the Country for the Duration
of the Talks.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the Security Council expanded its mandate to assist
the implementation of the 27 June 1997 General Agreement on the
Establishment of Peace and National Accord in Tajikistan.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Discuss Curbing Small Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The meeting follows General Assembly's resolution 54/54 of 15
December 1999, entitled "Small Arms", which requests Secretary-
General Kofi Annan to submit a study as a background document for
the U.N. conference on the illicit trade in small arms and light
weapons to be held in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sees small arms proliferation as an issue related to
security, human rights and development as it sustains and
exacerbates armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Much of the cold war's small arms surplus finished up in the
world's most dangerous conflict zones, Annan said in one section
of his report to the U.N. Millennium Assembly to be held in
September this year.
</P>
<P>
As the number of weapons in circulation grew, their prices fell,
making access to them ever easier even in the poorest countries.
Some 500 million small arms are estimated to be in circulation,
the U.N. chief found.
</P>
<P>
About 50 to 60 percent of the world's trade in small arms is
legal, but legally exported weapons often find their way into the
illicit market.
</P>
<P>
According to Annan, these weapons must be brought under the
control of U.N. member states which must be held accountable for
their transfer.
</P>
<P>
A total of 20 governmental experts were appointed by the
Secretary-General. They represent Argentina, Belgium, Brazil,
Bulgaria, Canada, China, Egypt, France, India, Israel, Jamaica,
Kenya, Mexico, Norway, Pakistan, Poland, Russia, South Africa,
Britain and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Continue Rising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks rose in the
second consecutive session Friday as a reported decline in April's
wholesale prices showed less inflationary pressure and eased fears
of higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 63.40 at 10,609.37,
extending its gain of 178.19 points Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The technology heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 29.48 at 3,529.
06. The composite rose 114.85 points in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Dow index ended the week with a gain of 31.51 points but
the Nasdaq composite lost 287.76 points in the week because of
heavy selling on Monday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor'
s 500 index rose 13.15 at 1,420.96.
</P>
<P>
Stocks rose as the Labor Department reported that the wholesale
prices fell 0.3 percent in April. The decline for the first time
in the 14 months eased worries about rising rates.
</P>
<P>
But investors, who were still worried about higher rates just a
few days before the Federal Reserve Board's policymaking meeting,
took profits in later session to lock in gains from the early
rally. Both the Dow and the Nasdaq rose as mush as 120 points in
early session.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believed the decline in wholesale prices in April as
well as a drop in retail sales in the same month will not dissuade
the Federal Reserve Board from raising rates at its meeting on May
16. The board has raised rates five times since June as a pre-
emptive move to ward off inflation.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 5.97 at 642.86 and the American Stock
Exchange index rose 10.11 at 936.21. The Russell 2000 index of

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,604 up, 1,330 down and 486

NYSE volume declined to 853.87 million shares from 947.41
