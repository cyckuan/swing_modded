<HEADLINE> Roundup: Malaysia, Malawi to Speed up Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Malawi are
making headway in speeding up their economic cooperation, with two
agreements and three memoranda of understanding (MOUs) signed in
the past three days between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The three MOUs signed here today between Malaysian and Malawian
firms paved the way for their cooperation in the financial and
mining sectors of Malawi.
</P>
<P>
Under the MOUs, Malaysian companies will set up an insurance
company in Malawi and will explore, develop and exploit oil and
natural gas and other resources in that country, in addition to
fostering joint ventures in commercial, trading, banking and
financial activities.
</P>
<P>
The two agreements singed here Thursday -- one on trade and the
other on investment protection and guarantee -- laid down a solid
foundation for expanding bilateral trade as well as for economic
and industrial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The agreements are expected to further stimulate the flow of
trade and investments between Malaysia and Malawi, and further tap
individual business initiatives between the private sectors of the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement by the Malaysian Ministry of
International Trade and Industry, the trade agreement will enhance
the development of bilateral trade relations through the granting
of the most-favored-nation treatment in matters relating to
customs duties and foreign trade formalities.
</P>
<P>
The investment guarantee agreement will help relieve investors
of their concern over matters pertaining to expropriation and
nationalization, repatriation of investments and settlement of
investment disputes, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are planning to establish a joint trade
committee to seek ways to enhance the two-way trade, the ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade totaled 1.87 million ringgit (about 748,000
U.S. dollars) in 1995, with Malaysian exports amounting to 1.33
million ringgit (about 532,000 U.S. dollars) and its imports from
Malawi 540,000 million ringgit (216,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Malawian President Bakili Muluzi, who arrived here Thursday for
a three-day visit, said at a luncheon today that his country is a
transformed economy and is currently enjoying high prospects of
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
He said that Malawi seeks to stimulate its private sector
through a privatization program, in which the government plans to
sell off 80 public enterprises, farms and ranches by 1998.
</P>
<P>
He noted that tourism is one of the areas where Malawi
desperately needs investment. The door is open for anyone,
including Malaysians, to set up modern hotel facilities in Malawi
which at the moment is short of no less than 3,000 bedrooms in the
hotel sector, he added.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here at the end of his visit today,
Muluzi invited Malaysian investors to venture into Malawi's
agricultural and manufacturing sectors.
</P>
<P>
He said Malawi is willing to supply labor force to Malaysia
which is facing a labor shortage due to its fast growing
industries.
</P>
<P>
On joint-venture businesses, he said that Telecom Malaysia
already signed an agreement last year with the Malawi Post and
Telecommunication Corporation on providing cellular telephone
services.
</P>
<P>
Airline companies and other relevant bodies in Malaysia will
undertake viability studies on a proposal to upgrade the transport
system in the land-locked Malawi.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia also offered training facilities to Malawi in fields
necessary for its development purposes.

<HEADLINE> EU Foreign Ministers to Discuss U.S. Military Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) foreign
ministers are expected to discuss EU reaction to the U.S. missile
attacks upon Iraq, Middle East peace process and a special EU
summit during the informal meeting in the southern Irish town
Tralee over the weekend, according to press reports from Ireland.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day conference, foreign ministers from the 15 EU
member states are due to discuss a common policy on the U.S.
military actions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring, who is the chairman of the
meeting, has acknowledged that there are "very different views"
among the EU member states on the U.S. action.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the EU has postponed issuing a joint
statement on the U.S. military action against Iraq, underlining
the division in Europe over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Britain has reportedly pushed for a strong statement of support
for the U.S. action, but others, notably France argued that such a
statement should come from EU foreign ministers rather than from
the normal committee of political officials.
</P>
<P>
France, which has refused to join the United States and Britain
in policing an expanded no-fly zone over southern Iraq, said that
the UN Security Council must reaffirm Iraq's sovereignty and
territorial integrity in any resolution concerning Iraq's
offensive in the Kurdish area of northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an interview with Irish Radio earlier today,
Spring, whose country is holding the current EU presidency, said
that he did not believe a common position on the issue could be
found.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process will be another major topic of
the meeting and Spring made it clear that he is to call on his EU
counterparts to focus on ways to help the Middle East peace
process get back on track.
</P>
<P>
On the special EU summit, Ireland has reportedly set the date
of October 5 for the summit and EU foreign ministers are expected
to confirm the date of the summit during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Ireland has been asked to host such a special EU summit when EU
leaders met in June in Florence. Italy and the idea is to discuss
various issues concerning the Intergovernment Conference.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Kathmandu College, an
international college affiliated with a U.S. university, has been
set up in Nepal to provide education for local students at
expenses lower than studying abroad, the official news agency RSS
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The college, opened here Friday, will start to give classes on
Monday in line with the same curriculum of the University of
Colorado in Denver, U.S., the report said.
</P>
<P>
With the establishment of the college, local students could
finish their first two years of bachelor-degree study in Nepal
before going to the U.S. to complete their degrees, thus reducing
the total expenses by around 50 percent, college sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Kathmandu College, a joint project of Nepal's Saan Research
Institute and the University of Colorado, offers courses in
sciences, arts, social studies and economics, they said.
</P>
<P>
The college in the Nepali capital is the third such academic
center after similar institutions were opened in Moscow and
Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Brings $1 Billion Damage to East U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Hurricane Fran that hit the
eastern coast of the United States in the last two days has
brought damages worth more than one billion U.S. dollars to both
South and North Carolina and neighboring states, according to
insurance industry's estimate.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of houses and inns were either flattened or ruined.
Tens of thousands of homes and businesses were damaged and crops
were destroyed by the hurricane over Thursday night and Friday
morning that also killed 12 people.
</P>
<P>
A New York based insurance institute said that initial estimate
showed 625 million dollars in damage from high winds, but when
flood damage is counted, the figure will go over one billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Tidal surges occasionally flooded coastal areas and in the area
between Wellington and Jacksonville, North Carolina, thousands of
trees were uprooted, and whole stands of pines were nearly snapped
in half.
</P>
<P>
There were reports of extensive flood damage in Raleigh,
capital of N. Carolina, and in the tobacco and vegetable growing
farmland of the eastern part of the state.
</P>
<P>
More than 1.1 million electric customers were without power in
North and South Carolina states. Officials said it would be
several days before power is restored in some areas.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to have more claims than in some of the other
storms," John Millen, a spokesman for National Insurance
Enterprise, was quoted by The New York Times said today. "We are
finding lots of damage from fallen trees, broken windows, tiles
off roofs and siding torn loose."
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton declared North Carolina and
Virginia disaster areas, making them eligible for federal
emergency assistance.

KUWAIT CITY, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministers of the
six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries gathered today in
Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, to discuss the situation
following the U.S. missile attacks on Iraq on September 3 and the
regional developments thereafter.
</P>
<P>
Omani Foreign Minister Yusif Bin Alawi Bin Abdallah said in the
inauguration session that the two-day meeting would focus on the
regional developments to contain any negative effect on the
security and stability of their countries, reports reaching here
from Riyadh said.
</P>
<P>
The recent developments in north Iraq following the Iraqi
army's offensive on Irbil, a city in the Kurds-controlled area in

report said.

The meeting is expected to map out a future strategy to
restore peace and security in the Gulf region and work out
plans to deal with the current situation, especially after the

<HEADLINE> EU Delegation to Visit PLO in East Jerusalem: Spring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Irish Foreign Minister Dick
Spring has voiced the determination that a European Union (EU)
delegation would visit the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)
in the disputed East Jerusalem, according to press reports from
Tralee, Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters during an informal meeting of EU foreign
ministers in southern Irish town Tralee, Spring, chairman of the
meeting, said that an EU "troika" of Ireland, the Netherlands and
Italy stuck to an earlier EU decision to visit the PLO in Orient
House, East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"I certainly feel that we should stick by that decision. We
want to make a contribution to the Middle East peace process and
it is important that we keep a balance in our relations with the
Israeli government and the Palestinian authority," Spring said.
</P>
<P>
Irish government officials, whose country is holding the
current EU presidency, noted that the EU agreed to go to Orient
House at a meeting in July and had not been advised of any change
in the location of the PLO's Orient House office.
</P>
<P>
If the Israeli government tried to prevent the visit, the
fact-finding mission to Israel could be canceled, Irish officials
added.
</P>
<P>
The topic is due to be discussed by the EU foreign ministers
during the two-day conference and a statement is expected to be
issued when the talks end on Sunday, according to EU officials.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts say that the EU is heading for a collision
course with the Israeli government, as Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy told Spring in Dublin on Thursday that his government
would oppose any plan which would take the EU fact-finding
mission to East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the Israeli government views visits to
Orient House as supporting PLO demands to make East Jerusalem the
capital of a Palestinian state and the fate of Jerusalem is
supposed to be negotiated as part of the Middle East peace
process.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges U.S. Senate to Ratify Chemical Weapons Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today urged the U.S. Republican-controlled Senate to ratify a
global treaty to ban all chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
"By voting for this treaty, the Senate can help to banish
poison gas from the Earth and make America's citizens and soldiers
much more secure," Clinton said in his weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
The Chemical Weapons Convention was signed in January 1993 but
has not yet come into effect because only 60 of the required 65
countries have ratified it. The United States and Russia, the
world's two leading chemical weapons powers, are among those yet
to give the final green light to the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Clinton stressed that the treaty, opposed by some conservative
legislators including Senator Jesse Helms, would strengthen the
hand of U.S. law enforcement officials by making it easier for
them to investigate those suspected of planning a chemical attack.
</P>
<P>
"We in America have been very fortunate in never experiencing a
terrorist attack with chemical weapons," the U.S. president said.
"Let's not wait. For the safety of our troops, and to fight terror
here and around the globe, the Senate should ratify the Chemical
Weapons Convention now."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate agreed in June to vote on the treaty by
September 14, but Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott complained on
Friday that the Clinton administration had not provided all the
information the legislators needed to cast their votes.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economic Growth to Continue into 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy will
continue to grow faster than expected well into 1997, according to
the Conference Board's fall economic forecast.
</P>
<P>
The growth is being driven by a "major expansion phase" in
industrial activities, which is not likely to peak until mid-1997,
according to the New York based private research group.
</P>
<P>
"Faster industrial activity will drive industrial prices back
to double digit increases in the fourth quarter of 1996," said
Gail Foster, the Conference Board's chief economist. "Inflation
will continue to creep upward, though inflation fears will likely
be greater than inflation reality," she said.
</P>
<P>
She projected real Gross Domestic Product will grow by 2.6
percent in 1996, and 3 percent in 1997. The rate of inflation will
average 3.1 percent in 1996, nudging up to 3.7 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board looks for unemployment rate to average 5.4
percent this year, falling to 4.9 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Foster said the Federal Reserve Board may be forced to tighten
interest rates more than expected, because the strength of the
economy is putting pressure on the bond market.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Mass Wedding Ceremony Drives Thousands to Ecstasy (I) (By Meng Xin, Liu Shun) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Waving flags and flowers,
clapping hands and yelling joyful greetings, thousands of people
thronged into a stadium here Friday night; they were there not as
usual for watching the locals' most favorite soccer match, but for
viewing the largest-ever mass wedding ceremony sponsored by the
government.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,200 brides and bridegrooms took part in the
ceremony amid deafening sounds of fireworks and amplified drum
beats, jubilant dancing and singing, dazzling lights, warm
applauses from the audience seated on the terraced viewing
stands. At the climax of the ceremony, hundreds of white balloons
released over the stadium, located in Nasr City, Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Suzanne Mubarak, wife of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
graced the occasion as one of the distinguished guests to
congratulate the brides and bridegrooms.
</P>
<P>
The wedding ceremony, which created an atmosphere of festivity,
was organized and financed by Egypt's Supreme Council for Youth
and Sports (SCYS) as part of its efforts to help low-income young
people to get married.
</P>
<P>
"It is a good idea to get married in such a way," said a
well-wisher who only identified herself as Randa.
</P>
<P>
Randa, whose friend was among the 632 brides in the stadium,
said that the government paid everything for the wedding ceremony
and this largely alleviated the burdens of these young couples.
</P>
<P>
"It will cost you a lot if you marry in the traditional way,
the expenses for a wedding will be extremely high," she said.
</P>
<P>
In Egypt, a wedding usually cost thousands of dollars though
the Egyptian's average monthly income is only 300 Egyptian pounds
(66 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The rich even spend up to 300,000 dollars for an extravagant
wedding ceremony at a five-star hotel, with the performance of a
famous belly-dancer, several famous singers, a large western-style
orchestra and traditional Egyptian musicians as well. Such a
ceremony is often attended by some 1,000 guests.
</P>
<P>
Wael Abo Elazm, whose 30-year-old brother Hossam became a
bridegroom in "the night in Egypt's love," as the grand ceremony
was so called, described the mass wedding ceremony as a nascent
matter.
</P>
<P>
"People like new things, so most people approve the idea of
marrying in a collective ceremony," he said.
</P>
<P>
Growing numbers of people in Egypt support the idea of mass
wedding as most couples-to-be, particularly bridegrooms, are
over-burdened by marriage expenses, including buying an apartment
and furnishing it.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Mass Wedding Ceremony Drives Thousands to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
But the idea of participation in the mass wedding ceremony is
facing opposition in this largely conservative Moslem
country. According to local newspaper the Egyptian Gazette, a
mother said she disapproves of the idea, because she wondered how
she would be able to kiss her daughter or take photos with her in
the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Still, some parents think participation in the mass ceremony is
too simple for a wedding, a once-in-a-lifetime event for most
young people.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, it has drawn growing support from the majority of
people. Most of the audience stayed on the stands watching the
ceremony, which began 9:30 p.m. Friday and lasted until 0:30
a.m. today.
</P>
<P>
It seemed that Elazm was not disappointed at all though he was
kept far away from his brother and sister-in-law in the
ceremony. All family members, including the parents, of the brides
and grooms sit on the stands of the stadium and were not allowed
to enter the field where the newlyweds were seated and served with
soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
Elazm had to use a small telescope in order to have a glimpse
of his brother. "Where is he? He disappeared? Oh, he's there, you
see, he is sitting at that table." Eight brides and bridegrooms
were sitting around a table.
</P>
<P>
Some couples left their tables and came near to the terraced
stands to receive greetings and congratulations from their
families and friends, who shouted, waved or clapped their hands in
response.
</P>
<P>
Some couples hoped that more of their families and friends could
have come to the ceremony, but each couple was allowed to invite
only 16 people.
</P>
<P>
As Egypt's top stars crooned love songs in the ceremony, which
was broadcast live by the Egyptian Television, the brides and
grooms danced to the tunes, while many women in the stands
produced "zagralat" as so called in Arabic, or thrilling cries of
jubilation uttered by women.
</P>
<P>
Suzanne, Egypt's first lady, said that it was her pleasure to
attend such a wonderful ceremony that these couples will remember
forever. "This ceremony is turning this sports field into an
island of happiness," she said.
</P>
<P>
According to organizers, the couples who had applied for
attending the ceremony were selected from 28 provinces throughout
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The first mass wedding ceremony in Egypt was held in 1993, when
50 couples attended. "Gradually there will be more and more mass
wedding ceremonies in Egypt," one organizer said.

<HEADLINE> Greek PM Outlines Economic Targets for 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 7 (xinhua) -- The further de-escalation of
inflation, the reduction of the public debt and accelerated growth
of GDP are the government's three main macroeconomic policy
targets for 1997, Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis announced
today in northern city of Salonika.
</P>
<P>
He was addressing a dinner traditionally given in honor of the
prime minister on the occasion of the 61st Salonika international
fair which opened today in the city.
</P>
<P>
According to Simitis, in 1997, the the inflation rate, which is
currently stands at 8.4 percent, will be further reduced by at
least 2-2.5 percentage points, the reduction of the public debt as
a percentage of GDP by 3-4 percentage points and the growth of GDP
is expected to reach 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Simitis said, the main goal of monetary and exchange
policy would continue to be stability and the combating of
inflation.
</P>
<P>
"This will generate suitable conditions for the further
reduction of interest rates and, consequently, the strengthening
of investment and economic activity in general," the premier said.
</P>
<P>
Simitis said the Greek economy was currently in a "peculiar
watershed", on the one hand showing some of the best performance
for many years, while on the other, faced with "a difficult course
ahead" in attaining the targets set by the European Union.
</P>
<P>
He said that even greater progress must be made in the economy
in order to avoid its being left out of the new EU".
</P>
<P>
In implementing the state budget for 1997, Simitis said, the
government would make every effort to attract private capital for
the financing of certain infrastructure works. In addition,
"socially unjustifiable" tax exemption would be abolished.
</P>
<P>
Privatization procedures will proceed "carefully", Simitis
added, stressing that the criteria to be applied in this respect
would be the relevant "development prospects, the credibility of
investors, the securing of as many jobs as possible together with
the parallel introduction of social protection measures".
</P>
<P>
In the public sector, the government's target would be "less
hirings, better wages", Simitis said.
</P>
<P>
Simitis also placed particular emphasis on the government's
efforts to develop the energy, tourism and agricultural sectors.
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is not just a strong Greece, but a Greece with a
better quality of life", Simitis said.
</P>
<P>
Defending his decision to call the early election, which will
be held on September 22, Simitis said the decision would have
beneficial results for the economy, since the "erosive
pre-election climate, promises and worthless handouts of the
opposition which would have destabilized the country for another
12 months" would be over in two weeks.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM: Arafat Astonished over Little Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said today that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was
astonished that little progress has been made in the peace march
after his landmark meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
"Arafat is astonished as the meeting with Netanyahu has not
come out with tangible results," Moussa told reporters following a
meeting between Arafat and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak at the
Cairo airport.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Arafat met Netanyahu for a brief summit on the
Israel-Gaza border in a bid to reactivate the stalled Middle East
peace process. It was the first face-to-face meeting between the
two leaders since Netanyahu took office in June.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, who was present at the Mubarak-Arafat meeting along
with Mubarak's top aide Osama el-Baz, said that Netanyahu's
meeting with Arafat was not a gift from the Israeli premier, but
it serves the interests of both sides.
</P>
<P>
The postponement of a meeting between Arafat and Israeli
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai is considered one of the
discouraging signs, he said. Israel reportedly announced today
that the meeting, scheduled for Sunday, has been postponed
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
"The picture today as regards the peace process does not look
good," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Israeli army should carry out its
redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron according to the
agreements signed between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israel has sought to change the terms of its promised pullout
from the West Bank town of Hebron on grounds that it wants to
protect Jewish settlers there.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived here earlier today to brief Mubarak on his
historical meeting with Netanyahu. Neither Arafat nor Mubarak
commented after their talks. Arafat later left Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting between Mubarak and Arafat, Moussa said
today that Egypt's position on a regional economic conference has
remained unchanged despite the fact that the meeting took place
between Arafat and Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
"The issue is not meetings and hand shakes, but rather depends
on Israel's implementation of agreements that could constitute
progress," Moussa said. "Egypt's position on the conference will
remain the same until we see real progress."
</P>
<P>
Egypt has threatened to cancel the Middle East and North Africa
Economic Summit slated for this year if there is no progress in
the Middle East peace process.

<HEADLINE> Christopher Warns Iraq of More Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher has warned that the United States would launch
more attacks against Iraq if Baghdad failed to understand the
message of U.S. military strikes earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Christopher, who has been visiting West European nations to
rally their support for the U.S. action, made the remarks in an
interview with the German newspaper Bild am Sonntag released ahead
of publication on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The United States launched two missile attacks on selected
targets including anti-air defense facilities in southern Iraq
earlier this week in an alleged retaliation of Iraqi troops'
incursion into the Kurdish north.
</P>
<P>
The satellite-guided missiles, fired from over 800 km away in
two strikes, severely damaged Iraqi defense systems by destroying
or damaging up to 11 to 15 targets, the Pentagon said in its first
public assessment of the raids on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Christopher alleged that the U.S. attacks on Iraq were an
"appropriate response" to Iraq's military action in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We are satisfied with our necessary and appropriate
response," he said. "It is the right message to Saddam Hussein."
</P>
<P>
However, the United States has reportedly received limited
support from its allies in Europe.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary
Malcolm Rifkind has warned that any further aggression by Iraq
will meet a tough response, according to a BBC television report
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in BBC's Today program, Rifkind said that he wanted to
make it clear to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein that "he loses
more than he gains" from each act of aggression.
</P>
<P>
The British Foreign Secretary emphasized that the British
government was not alone among EU nations in backing the U.S.
missile attacks upon Iraqi targets.
</P>
<P>
Those countries, which are against the U.S. military action
against Iraq, had put forward no alternative strategy under such
circumstances, Rifkind added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. missile attacks upon Iraq is causing splits
at an informal meeting of the European Union (EU) foreign
ministers at Tralee, Ireland.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that there are sharp differences among the 15 EU
member states over a common EU policy towards the U.S. military
action.
</P>
<P>
Britain has reportedly urged other EU partners to issue a
strong statement in support of the U.S. action, but other
countries, notably France is strongly against such a statement.
</P>
<P>
Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring, whose country is holding a
six-month EU presidency, said earlier today that unity among the
EU member states on the issue was impossible.

DAR ES SALAAM, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian
government has requested food assistance from the World Food
Program (WFP) for over 600,000 people who are expected to face
severe food shortages from November this year in the northern
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Prime Minister's Office told the Tanzania

<HEADLINE> UK Factory Output Grows 0.5 Percent in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Factory output in Britain
enjoyed a tentative recovery in July, one of the first signs of an
upturn in manufacturing, suggesting that the sector is beginning
to emerge from its stagnation this year.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said Friday that
having fallen 0.1 percent in June, manufacturing rose by 0.5
percent in July, but in the three months to July, factory output
has shown no growth at all compared with the previous three months
and was o.1 percent lower than the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Overall industrial production, which includes output of oil and
energy, grew 0.5 percent as well in the month, having dropped 0.9
percent in June.
</P>
<P>
The ONS said that its estimate of underlying growth in
manufacturing is still zero, as it has been since December. This
served to underline the fact that any manufacturing recovery is in
its very early stages and is far from dramatic.
</P>
<P>
The figures will make it difficult for the Chancellor Kenneth
Clarke to justify further reductions in interest rates although
analysts see little immediate reason for him to consider a rate
rise.
</P>
<P>
Rates were left unchanged at 5.75 percent after Clarke's
meeting with Bank of England governor Eddie George Wednesday and
are thought likely to remain.

<P>
LONDON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Teenagers under-18-year in
Britain will be banned from drinking in public and the police are
to be given new powers to confiscate alcohol found on them, the
British government proposed today.
</P>
<P>
According to a Home Office consultation paper, Under-Age
Drinking in Public, which is published today, teenagers found with
alcoholic drink would have to provide their name and address, and
failure to do so could result in a 500 pounds (775 US dollars)
fine.
</P>
<P>
The planned laws would also allow the police to seize alcohol
from adults in a public place if they believed the drink was going
to be given to an under-aged person.
</P>
<P>
The move follows growing concern about youngsters who meet in
public places, get drunk and cause a nuisance by harassing
passers-by and vandalising buildings.
</P>
<P>
The government will consult the police, magistrates and other
interested parties up to October 14. The Home Office may use a
Private Member's Bill to bring in new laws.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian and Israeli
negotiators reached an understanding protocol before the meeting
between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
PLO Secretary General Abu Mazen today revealed to Palestinian
Arabic daily Al-Ayyam some key points of the agreement reached
between the two sides, according to a report of JMCC, a
Palestinian press service based in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The understanding protocol, which paved the way for the
summit between Arafat and Netanyahu, was reached under the
sponsorship of Terje Larson, the U.N. Coordinator of Activities
in Palestinian Territories.
</P>
<P>
The secret negotiations were attended by Abu Mazen and Dore
Gold, Netanyahu's political adviser.
</P>
<P>
The key points are:
</P>
<P>
1. Activate Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on all levels;
</P>
<P>
2. The Palestinian-Israeli Joint Steering Committee will
monitor implementation of issues and commitments stated by the
the Oslo 2 agreement signed in Taba, Egypt's Red Sea resort, in
1995;
</P>
<P>
3. As a beginning, the Steering Committee will directly deal
with main issues of the imposed Israeli closure on Palestinian
lands, redeployment of Israeli troops in Hebron, Gaza
International Airport and the security issues, then both sides
will start dealing with the rest of suspended issues;
</P>
<P>
4. Dealing with issues of final status as soon as possible;
</P>
<P>
5. To negotiate in order to create results on ground, and not
only for the purpose of mere negotiations;
</P>
<P>
6. Any differences between both parties must be turned to
President Arafat and Premier Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
At the cabinet meeting Friday morning, Netanyahu told the
ministers that there was no secret deals for the summit, but an
agreement of understanding between Israel and the Palestinian
Authority.

The forecast by UBS, one of Britain's leading housing analysts,
comes against a background of mounting evidence that the housing
market recovery gathered pace during this summer.
</P>
<P>
The bank believes that average UK house prices will increase
seven percent this year and 10 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The forecast is based on a prediction that personal incomes
would increase substantially next year because of tax cuts. It
expected income growth of nearly six percent this year and the
next.
</P>
<P>
Prices in London and the southeast will show even greater
increases, UBS predicted. Property prices in those areas this year
will go up by 12 percent and by 15 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
But the housing market will be weakest in the northwest, where
it expected prices to increase three percent this year and four
percent in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Condemns UN Embargo on National Airways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Sudan's Minister of Culture and
Information Al-Tayeb Ibrahim Khair has described the United
Nations decision to impose an air embargo on the country as
"arbitrary and unjustified".
</P>
<P>
At a news conference on Friday in Abuja, capital of Nigeria,
Khair appealed to the member nations of the Non-Aligned Movement
to condemn the act.
</P>
<P>
The UN Security Council has recently called for an embargo, in
its resolution 1070, on Sudan Airways' international flights and
any other aircraft registered in the country for its alleged
support for terrorism.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister denied his country's involvement in
terrorism, pointing out that the embargo will cause untold
suffering to the people as the airways services are concentrated
in the areas with "humanitarian matters".
</P>
<P>
"This double-standards policy against some members of the
Non-Aligned Movement has exposed the wild attack launched against
our people and their heritage," he said, quoted by the News
Agency of Nigeria today.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the Sudanese government is making
deliberate efforts to end its 13-year-old civil war with the
signing of a peace agreement with seven of the eight rebel groups
in the country.
</P>
<P>
He urged the neighbors of the country to accept Sudan's peace
overtures and assured them that his country has no evil design on
any country.

<HEADLINE> Report: Foreign Buyers Approach Israel For Arrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Several countries have
expressed interest in purchasing Arrow 2 anti-missile missile
following its highly successful test on August 20, according to
The Jerusalem Report, an Israeli bi-weekly English magazine.
</P>
<P>
Doron Suslik, spokesman for Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI),
which is developing the Arrow, said that the IAI is not yet
dealing with marketing, but referring requests for information to
the American Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO), the
agency overseeing U.S. involvement in the project.
</P>
<P>
Suslik revealed, however, that Britain has been granted access
to detailed secret information on the project.
</P>
<P>
A high-level team headed by IAI Director General Moshe
Keret would hold meetings on the Arrow 2 anti-missile umbrella
with British defense experts during a visit to the Farnborough
air show in September.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in the past year, high-level U.K. defense teams have
come to Israel at least twice to discuss the project. They were
given detailed classified information, but only after Israel got
the green light from the U.S. -- which has provided 72 percent of
the project funding.
</P>
<P>
In no other case was Israel given permission to go into the
same degree of detail, and it turned down requests for sensitive
details from several interested parties, including some from the
Far East.
</P>
<P>
The latest Arrow test exceeded all expectations. The
intercepting missile scored a direct hit on its incoming missile
target at a height of 20 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Suslik said that the Arrow will be fully operational by
the end of 1998. The IAI is hoping to build on the
high-profile success to market other systems as well, such as
Shavit satellite launching system -- which has launched the
three Israel Ofek communications satellites without a hitch.

AMMAN, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan,
the Regent, said here today that Jordan's relations with the
United States should also involve the contribution of the
U.S. private sector in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
During his talks here with visiting U.S. assistant Secretary of
State for Economic, Trade and Agricultural Affairs Juan Spero,

<TEXT>

LUSAKA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Former Zambian President
Kenneth Kaunda said here today that all political parties should
meet next week under the chairmanship of the Law Association of
Zambia or the church.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a rally, the leader of the biggest opposition
United National Independence Party (UNIP) said President
Frederick Chiluba should not chair the meeting, because this is
what the ruling Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) was
against before the 1991 general elections.
</P>
<P>
He said that the habit of meeting opposition political
parties individually is absurd and all political stake holders
should meet together to iron out certain national pressing
issues.
</P>
<P>
One day before Chiluba met with Kaunda in the state lodge here
on August 30, Kaunda insisted that the proposed meeting should be
held at a neutral venue and under a neutral chairmanship. He also
said the meeting should involve all parties instead of on the
one-to-one basis.
</P>
<P>
But the government said one-to-one meeting should first be
held before the inter-party meeting.

<HEADLINE> Israeli scientist Advises not to Give Aspirin to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 8 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli scientist has
advised parents to give children paracetamol for fever and pain
instead of aspirin, the Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Liubov Ben-Noun, of the department of family medicine at
the Israeli Ben-Gurion University's Health Sciences Faculty, said
in an article carried by Medicine, a publication of the Israel
Medical Association, that aspirin can also cause Reye's syndrome,
and possible severe liver damage, wasting of fat in the internal
organs and harm to the tissue covering the brain of children.
</P>
<P>
The Russian-born doctor surveyed 209 children who came from
the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) between 1991 and
1995 and have been treated in community health-fund clinics.
</P>
<P>
He found that when they lived in Russia, three-quarters of the
children were given aspirin by their parents for fever and pain,
as this was the accepted drug for fever and pain, and pharmacology
books did not mention the possible risks of aspirin to children.
</P>
<P>
Many of the immigrants brought aspirin with them and continued
to give children this drug, the scientist said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ben-Noun noted that during his study, not a single Reye's
syndrome was reported in the southern city of Beersheba, where
most of the residents are of Russian origin. It is regarded as
rare.
</P>
<P>
But even so, the scientist said, pediatricians should be alert
and impress upon parents that paracetamol is preferable to aspirin
for children, since aspirin is freely available over the counter
in pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
The syndrome was first described by Dr. R.D.K. Reye in 1963,
and is often fatal. It affects youngsters to the age of 18. There
are one to 2.5 cases per 100,000 children. Whether a child is
affected by the syndrome depends on genetic, environmental and
other factors, including whether they previously suffered from
fatal diseases such as influenza and chicken pox.

<HEADLINE> GCC Calls for Respecting Iraqi Sovereignty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministers of the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) today wrapped up their 60th
meeting in Riyadh, capital of Saudi Arabia, with a final
communique stressing the necessity of respecting the sovereignty
of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here from Riyadh said that the GCC states,
including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates (UAE),
Qatar, Bahrain and Oman, also reaffirmed their commitment to the
unity of the U.S.-led international alliance.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement, GCC Secretary General Jameel Bin Ibrahim
Al-Hujeilan expressed the GCC's deep anxiety to the situation in
the region and its threat to the international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the ministerial council "condemned strongly"
the interference of some neighboring countries in north Iraq and
called on these states to stop "immediately and completely"
interference in Iraq's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
It also affirmed the GCC's permanent stand to preserve Iraq's
independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity as well
as its regional safety.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ministerial council expressed support and
appreciation of the efforts of the international alliance states
that generated a big impact in taking all necessary measures to
implement the Security Council's resolutions pertaining to the
Iraqi aggression of Kuwait, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The session also reviewed a number of political, economic and
security issues as well as the latest developments in Arab and
international arenas, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Regarding to the Turkish announcement Saturday that
preparations for the establishment of a Turkish buffer zone in
northern Iraq were finalized, the GCC states expressed belief
that Arab states would not accept any violation of Iraq's
territorial integrity or the establishment of the zone inside Iraq
by a neighboring state.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting chaired by Omani Foreign Minister Yousuf
Bin Alawi Bin Abdullah was held in the wake of the U.S. missile
strikes against selected air defense targets in northern Iraq
Tuesday and Wednesday in retaliation for the Iraqi army's
incursion into the Kurdish area in northern Iraq which has been
under protection of the U.N. forces as a safe haven for the Iraqi
Kurds.

<HEADLINE> Okinawans Want Smaller U.S. Military Presence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Okinawan people sent a strong
signal to both Tokyo and Washington today that they want a smaller
U.S. military presence in their hometown.
</P>
<P>
Final polling results showed that 482,538 voters, or 89 percent
of those who voted in the unprecedented prefectural referendum,
said "yes" to cuts in the U.S. military bases in the southernmost
prefecture, the local media reported.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa Governor Masahide Ota, appearing on the television
screen, was all smiles after polling results showed the big
majority of voters cast affirmative ballots.
</P>
<P>
"I will respect the wishes of the people of Okinawa Prefecture
as demonstrated in today's balloting and continue to make efforts
to resolve the base problem," Ota told a televised news conference
after the plebiscite.
</P>
<P>
The outcome reflected the Okinawa people's long-held wish to
redress the disproportionately large presence of U.S. military
bases in their small island prefecture, located 1,600 kilometers
southwest of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
About 28,000 or 60 percent of the 45,300 U.S. soldiers in Japan
are based in Okinawa. In addition, 75 percent of U.S. military
facilities in Japan are located in the southernmost prefecture,
which occupies only 0.6 percent of the country's land area.
</P>
<P>
Although the plebiscite is not legally binding, it provided the
first opportunity for Okinawans to express their years of
frustration over the heavy U.S. military presence on the island in
an official and visible manner.
</P>
<P>
The outcome of the poll could affect Okinawa Governor Masahide
Ota's final decision on refusing to complete procedures necessary
for extending leases of privately-owned land to the U.S. military
bases. It may also affect the central government's position on
the bases issue.
</P>
<P>
Today's referendum was held about a year after the rape of an
Okinawan schoolgirl by three U.S. servicement, who have been
convicted and are now serving prison terms.
</P>
<P>
The rape sparked renewed anti-base sentiment among Okinawans,
and Ota has spearheaded a campaign against the central government
by refusing to carry out legal procedures needed for the continued
forced land leasing.
</P>
<P>
The referendum followed the Supreme Court ruling last month
that recognized the government expropriation of land for use by
the U.S. military bases as constitutional and rejected Ota's
appeal against a lower court order that the governor sign
documents needed for renewing the land rental to the U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
The referendum asked: "Do you favor or oppose a review of the
Japan-U.S. Status of Forces Agreement and the consolidation and
reduction of U.S. military bases in the prefecture?"
</P>
<P>
Ota, a vocal advocate of the total withdrawal of U.S. troops,
will relay the outcome to Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto in
their meeting scheduled for Tuesday in Tokyo, an event that will
mark the climax of a protracted tug-of-war between the prefectural
and central governments. Ota is also expected to relay the
results to Washington.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto pledged earlier in the day the government's
commitment to satisfy Okinawan calls for a U.S. base reduction.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto and U.S. President Bill Clinton agreed in April to
reduce the size of U.S. military facilities in Okinawa by 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
Implementation of the accord, however, has been moving slowly
as local governments and residents in other parts of Japan have
been reluctant to accept the relocation of U.S. military
facilities from Okinawa.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Olympic champion Cuba defeated
China 3-0 in the last game to win the second leg of the World
Women's Volleyball Grand Prix with unbeaten records here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Cuba, which lost to China in the first leg in Sendai, Japan,
was never behind in Sunday's 15-3, 15-10, 15-10 victory.
</P>
<P>
"We didn't play well in Japan, but our players had high morale
before today's game," said Cuban coach Antonio Perdomo. "They
showed their determination on court and from their performance we
could see they had made progress."
</P>
<P>
Chinese coach Lang Ping said, "China played in a quite passive
position. Cuba's service, blocking and attacking were all so great
that we had no chance to fight back."
</P>
<P>
Regla Bell scored 11 points, seven from spiking and four from
blocking, to lead the Cuban spikers. Regla Torres had nine points
and Marleny Costa added seven.
</P>
<P>
China's best scorer was Wu Yongmei, who claimed six points
before the 5,600-strong yelling crowd in National Olympic
Gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
In another match on Sunday, South Korea outspiked the
Netherlands 15-11, 15-6 and 17-16 to avenge their loss to the
Dutch squad at the Atlanta Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands seemed to be able to pull one back when they
lead the third set 14-11, but only to see the resilient South
Koreans came back to tie it 14-14, 15-15 and 16-16.
</P>
<P>
South Korean coach Kim Cheol-yong said they were simply lucky
to win the match.
</P>
<P>
"My players are shorter and it is simply exhausting to jump for
spiking and blocking. We are happy with our victory," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dutch coach Bert Goedkoop said, "We fell disappointed for our
three matches in Beijing. Maybe we are not capable of preparing
for such kind of tournament after the Olympics."
</P>
<P>
He said his young players, mostly 20-year-old, had yet to
accustomed themselves to playing for a whole year.
</P>
<P>
China finished second in the Beijing leg with two wins and one
loss.
</P>
<P>
Both South Korea and the Netherlands were winless but the later
won less sets to finish bottom.

<HEADLINE> North Mogadishu Courts Impose Ban on Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Islamic courts of north
Mogadishu issued a decree today to ban the movement of all kinds
of weapons at the crossing of the city devision line.
</P>
<P>
The decree targeted especially at the weapons carried by
escort of foreign journalists, saying the practice is extremely
endangering the security situation in north Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The northern part of the Somali capital city has been under
the control of Ali Mahdi Mohammed while the southern part
dominated by Hussein Mohamed Aidid, who succeeded the late
Mohamed Farah Aidid, his father, in early August this year.
</P>
<P>
The north Mogadishu decree said no extra weapons are needed in
north Mogadishu since the Islamic courts are in full control of
the security situation.
</P>
<P>
The decree demanded foreign journalists and agencies to report
their arrival before coming to the division line, so that the
necessary security arrangements could be made.
</P>
<P>
Those caught with weapons while crossing the line would be
charged for possessing illegal weapons, the decree said.
</P>
<P>
Almost all the armed men accompanying foreigners were once
street fighters who may fight again when meeting each other in
the streets of north Mogadishu, according to the decree.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United Somali Congress of Somali National
Alliance (USC/SNA) in support of Osman Hassan Ali Atto, warned
that Malaysian nationals in south Mogadishu may not enjoy peace.
</P>
<P>
The organization will not guarantee the security of Malaysians
since they are not working towards the common good of the Somali
people, according to the organization interior secretary, Abdi
Hassan Awale Qeyb.
</P>
<P>
Atto's faction is allied to Ali Mahdi, but in the southern part
of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
"The responsibility of any Malaysian killed in south Mogadishu
will rest upon the shoulders of the Malaysian government," Qeyb
warned.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Okinawans Want U.S. Base Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 8 (Xinhua) -- An overwhelming majority of
voters in Okinawa voted "yes" to cuts in U.S. military bases in an
unprecedented prefectural referendum today, early polling results
showed.
</P>
<P>
Polling officials, announcing the first interim balloting
results 8 p.m., said 22,716 voters cast affirmative ballots in the
referendum and 2,695 said "no", Kyodo News reported in dispatches
from the prefectural capital of Naha.
</P>
<P>
According to estimates made 30 minutes before the closure of
the balloting, 53.36 percent of the 909,757 eligible voters cast
their ballots, Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
The outcome reflected the Okinawa people's long-held wish to
redress the disproportionately large presence of U.S. military
bases in their small island prefecture, located 1,600 kilometers
southwest of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
About 28,000 or 60 percent of the 45,300 U.S. soldiers in Japan
are based in Okinawa. In addition, 75 percent of U.S. military
facilities in Japan are located in the southernmost prefecture,
which occupies only 0.6 percent of the country's land area.
</P>
<P>
Although the plebiscite is not legally binding, it provided the
first opportunity for Okinawans to express how they feel about the
heavy U.S. military presence on the island in an official and
visible manner.
</P>
<P>
The outcome of the poll could affect Okinawa Governor Masahide
Ota's final decision on refusing to complete procedures necessary
for extending leases of privately-owned land to the U.S. military
bases. It may also affect the central government's position on
the bases issue.
</P>
<P>
Today's referendum was held about a year after the rape of an
Okinawan schoolgirl by three U.S. servicement, who have been
convicted and are now serving prison terms.
</P>
<P>
The rape renewed anti-base sentiment among Okinawans, and Ota
has spearheaded a campaign against the central government by
refusing to carry out legal procedures needed for the continued
forced land leasing.
</P>
<P>
The referendum followed the Supreme Court ruling last month
that recognized the government expropriation of land for use by
the U.S. military bases as constitutional and rejected Ota's
appeal against a lower court order that the governor sign
documents needed for renewing the land rental to the U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
The referendum asked: "Do you favor or oppose a review of the
Japan-U.S. Status of Forces Agreement and the consolidation and
reduction of U.S. military bases in the prefecture?"
</P>
<P>
Ota, a vocal advocate of the total withdrawal of U.S. troops,
will relate the outcome to Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto in
their meeting scheduled for Tuesday in Tokyo, an event that will
mark the climax of a protracted tug-of-war between the prefectural
and central governments. Ota is also expected to relay the
results to Washington.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto pledged earlier in the day the government's
commitment to satisfy Okinawan calls for a U.S. base reduction.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto and U.S. President Bill Clinton agreed in April to
reduce the size of U.S. military facilities in Okinawa by 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
Implementation of the accord, however, has been moving slowly
as local governments and residents in other parts of Japan have
been reluctant to accept the relocation of U.S. military
facilities from Okinawa.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Economy Grows at 8.4 Pct in 2nd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 8 (xinhua) -- Malaysia's real gross
domestic product (GDP) growth in the second quarter this year was
recorded at an annual rate of 8.4 percent compared with 8.3
percent in the previous quarter, according to the country's
National Bank today.
</P>
<P>
The bank said a statement that the growth momentum was
supported by continued expansion in all major sectors --
manufacturing, construction, services, agriculture and mining.
</P>
<P>
Output of the manufacturing sector expanded at a slower pace of
12.3 percent compared with 14 percent in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
Domestic-oriented industries, such as those producing transport
equipment, and construction-related, rubber, non-metallic mineral
and petroleum products, expanded at 15.6 percent as against 18.2
percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Output of export-oriented industries moderated to a growth of
9.6 percent from 10.5 percent in the first quarter as it was
largely affected by the slower growth of the electronics and
electrical industry due to excess supply of semiconductors in the
world market, especially computer memory chips, and competition
from overseas manufacturers of electrical products like air-
conditioners and audio-related products, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture sector rebounded strongly to record an annual
growth of 5.8 percent in the quarter under review following a
decline of 3.1 percent in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
The construction sector expanded by 11.5 percent in the second
quarter while the service sector grew at an annual rate of 8.6
percent with finance, insurance, real estate and business
services, transport, storage and communications and utilities
sub-sectors expanding at double-digit rates.
</P>
<P>
On the investment front, private investor sentiment remained
favourable with the value of manufacturing investments approved by
the government amounting to 7.2 billion ringgit (about 2.88
billion u.s. dollars) in the second quarter compared with 9.7
billion ringgit (about 3.88 billion u.s. dollrs) in the first
qyarter.
</P>
<P>
Inflation edged upward in the second quarter, rising at an
annual rate of 3.7 percent compared with 3.4 percent in the
previous quarter, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The country's total debt increased marginally by 0.5 percent to
90.8 billion ringgit (about 36.32 billion u.s. dollars) at the end
of June, it said adding this was due entirely to the increase in
domestic debt of 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
As at the end of June, the outstanding domestic debt amounted
to 78.5 billion ringgit (about 31.9 billion u.s. dollars),
presenting 87 percent of the total debt outstanding.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Female Teachers in Primitive Village (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Two young female teachers, Yao
Lizhen, 27, and Huang Guanghai, 23 have earned top marks after
three years of hard work in Langwangduo, the most primitive and
out-of-the-way village in China.
</P>
<P>
Langwangduo is a small village in Gongshan Dulong and Nu
Autonomous County, Yunnan Province, southwest China. It is by the
Telawang River, a branch of the Dulong River.
</P>
<P>
The two teachers have succeeded in ensuring that every
school-age child in their remote village receives an education.
</P>
<P>
The village population includes 100 people of the Dulong
ethnic group, which has a total population of 5,000 living along
the Dulong River flowing through southwestern China.
</P>
<P>
The Dulong River Valley is surrounded by high mountains. To its
west and south is the Dandanglika Mountains, almost 4,480 meters
above sea level, and bordering on Burma. To its north is the
Tibetan Plateau, and to its east are the Gaoligong Mountains,
5,128 meters above sea level. These walls of mountains separate
the village from other areas.
</P>
<P>
With the lowest place still 3,800 meters above sea level, the
valley is the only place not accessible to highways in China.
</P>
<P>
The valley passes are closed by snow between November and late
May, during which time it is impossible for villagers to
communicate with the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Before 1949 when the People's Republic was founded, Dulong
people still lived a primitive life, characterized by the
slash-and-burn method.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of New China, 14 primary schools with near
600 pupils have been built in the valley and the students enjoy
free education. Langwangduo Primary School, one of 14 schools,
has 41 pupils in four grades.
</P>
<P>
The school has five wooden rooms, three of which are
classrooms, one is used as a storehouse and the other as both the
bedroom and the office for Yao and Huang.
</P>
<P>
Courses in the school, which are the same as in other primary
schools throughout China, include Chinese language, mathematics,
nature, morals, physical education and music.
</P>
<P>
The pupils do not have enough exercise books. They write on the
ground with twigs. Yao and Huang also teach pupils to sing the
national anthem.

<P>
Without power supply, in the evening they have to correct the
pupils' exercises, and prepare lessons for the next day, in the
dim light of kerosene lamps.
</P>
<P>
The village has no telephone, newspapers or magazines. Between
November and May each year, they are, in fact, completely
separated from the rest of China.
</P>
<P>
In February 1996, their home town of Lijiang was hit by an
earthquake. But because the valley's passes were closed by heavy
snow, villagers had to stay in their homes, anxious about the
safety of their families.
</P>
<P>
The local government sees to it that textbooks and notebooks
are ready for them, and sent to the school before the closure of
the passes.
</P>
<P>
Both Yao and Huang's earn 225.5 yuan in salary each month, but
that only covers half of their living expenses. So they have to
plant vegetables and walk for a whole day to buy cheaper food and
other necessities in the town, where the township government is
seated.
</P>
<P>
Most children in the village live far away from the school. As
a result, some of them are often absent from school. Yao and Huang
often go to their homes at weekends to help them with lessons.
</P>
<P>
With their help and encouragement, 100 percent of the children
of school age in the village are now at the school. One of them
even walks several kilometers to school every day.
</P>
<P>
Both Yao and Huang are still single. Yao said: "I will not
consider getting married until I have made my teaching career a
complete success."
</P>
<P>
Asked about what problems they have encountered, they answer
that the only difficulty is the little attention paid by some
parents to their children's education.

<HEADLINE> Turkish FM Condemns Greek Cypriots for Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister
and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller today strongly condemned the
Greek Cypriots for killing one Turkish Cypriot soldier and
wounding another one in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Ciller said in a statement that "Turkey is ready to take
necessities every time."
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported that two
specially-trained Greek Cypriot soldiers shot dead one Turkish
Cypriot soldier and wounded another on duty in the Security
Forces Commandership in Guvercinlik village near Gazi Magosa city
in northern Cyprus early this morning.
</P>
<P>
This fact is announced after British police and U.N. peace-
keeping officials made investigations into the scene of the
incident, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Undersecretary of the Turkish Foreign Ministry Onur
Oymen summoned British Ambassador to Ankara Kieran Prendergast
and informed him about the incident which occurred in northern
Cyprus at 04:00 a.m. local time today.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting with Oymen, Prendergast denounced the
incident in northern Cyprus as "crime."
</P>
<P>
On August 14, Turkish Cypriot troops killed a Greek Cypriot
protester as he was climbing up a flagpole to tear down the
Turkish flag on the edge of the northern Cyprus side.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred after the funeral of another Greek
Cypriot, Tassos Issac, 24, who was beaten to death on August 11
in clashes between the Greek Cypriot demonstrators and Turkish
troops in the 180-kilometer-long buffer zone controlled by the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
More than 30,000 Turkish troops are stationed in northern
Cyprus to protect the Turkish Cypriots in the northern part of
the Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when the Turkish troops
intervened following a coup supported by Athens.
</P>
<P>
Northern Cyprus leader Rauf Denktash declared independence in
the northern part of the island as "Turkish Republic of Northern
Cyprus" in 1983, but it is only recognized by Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Beekeeping Booms in Zambia Bushes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Beekeeping has made a remarkable
progress in Northwestern Province of Zambia in recent years with
honey exports increased from one ton in 1990 to 84 tons in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, the locality has collected
and sold 119.8 tons of honey and 9.9 tons of wax.
</P>
<P>
This was recently announced by Bob Malichi, general manager of
the Northwestern Bee Products Ltd.
</P>
<P>
He was briefing officials of the United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) and journalists on September 2 at the honey
processing factory located in Kabompo, a beautiful town at the
bank of River Kabombo in the bushes of Zambia's northwestern
border area.
</P>
<P>
The second largest in Zambia, the province boasts vast land
covered with wild bushes.
</P>
<P>
Flowers are blossoming all the year round without any trace of
pollusion caused either by chemichal fertilizer, insecticides, or
by other industrial hazards.
</P>
<P>
The quality of honey produced here is the best and the honey
is well sold in foreign markets, Malichi said confidently.
</P>
<P>
The visitors were later invited to a beekeepers association
meeting of more than 500 attendents, who came from four districts
of Zambizi, Kabompo, Mufumbwe and Mwinilunga of the province.
</P>
<P>
Co-chaired by tradition headmen, senior chief Sikogela of
Kabombo and Chief Chibwika of Mwinilunga, the annual meeting was
devoted to exchange of experience for further development of the
beekeeping industry in the province.
</P>
<P>
Hard work with their own hands would bring "life as sweet as
honey", the chief of Mwinilunga said in his speech to the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
He called on beekeepers to take the lead in the local
residents in efforts to bring prosperity to the region.
</P>
<P>
The visitors were also impressed with the increasing role
of women in the industry.
</P>
<P>
There was nearly no women involvement in the industry when it
was introduced into the region in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the industry is today witnessing the involvement
of 40 women in five groups in the four districts.
</P>
<P>
The women interests are already represented at both the
association and the board of directors of the bee products
company, which, among others, help beekeepers diversify
production for better economic results.
</P>
<P>
For example, the company is encouraging beekeepers to grow
groundnuts, sesame, castor and ginger by helping collect the
seeds of crops together with honey and sell them in both domestic
and foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
In a store room of the honey processing factory, the visitors
saw large bags of groundnuts, sesame seeds, castor seeds and
gingers.
</P>
<P>
Malichi took up some small plastic bags of groundnuts and
distributed among visitors as souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
"Please take it and let Chinese friends afar to have a test of
the groundnuts grown in the whild bush," he told me when he
knew that I was a Chinese correspondent.

<HEADLINE> Big Majority of Okinawa Voters Back U.S. Bases Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 8 (Xinhua) -- An overwhelming majority of
voters in Okinawa voted "yes" in a referendum today to support the
cut of U.S. military bases in the prefecture, the Kyodo News
Service reported.
</P>
<P>
Results at 8:00 p.m. showed that a total of 22,716 voters cast
"yes" ballots while 2,695 others voted against the reduction,
Kyodo said in reporting initial results from the balloting.
</P>
<P>
Estimates made 30 minutes before the closure of the balloting
indicated that 53.36 percent of the 909,757 eligible voters cast
their ballots, Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa Governor Masahide Ota described the referendum as a
"historic event," saying that the Okinawan people had never been
asked how they felt about the U.S. military presence.
</P>
<P>
The vote came one year after the rape of a 12-year-old
schoolgirl by three U.S. servicemen led to the largest anti-base
protests ever in Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
The Okinawans had insisted for years on the withdrawal of the
U.S. forces on the islands because their southern prefecture was
heavily burdened by the presence of nearly 30,000 U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa makes up less than one percent of Japan's total land
area, but accounts for 75 percent of the land used by the 47,000
U.S. troops deployed in the country.
</P>
<P>
Ota, who is a vocal advocate of the total withdrawal of the
U.S. troops, was expected to report the outcome of the referendum
to Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto in a meeting here on Tuesday
</P>
<P>
Ota still faces two separate lawsuits brought by Hashimoto over
the expropriation of land for use by U.S. military bases in the
island prefecture.

<HEADLINE> Greek AIDS Patients Receive New Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 AIDS patients in
Greece who are receiving a new treatment of combined therapies
with the help of three imported new protease drugs against AIDS
have shown unbelievable improvement.
</P>
<P>
The new combination of drugs has succeeded in isolating and
suppressing the AIDS virus in the human organism to such levels
that "you cannot even trace it in the blood" and this has never
happened before, the Athens daily "Ta Nea" (The News) reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The new therapies, called the "cocktail of hope," combine one
of the three new protease inhibitors -- saquinavir, ritonavir and
indinavir -- with older AIDS drugs such as AZT, DDI, DDC, 3TC and
D4T.
</P>
<P>
"This is the medicine of the future and is what we have been
waiting for," the paper quoted George Stergios, head of the AIDS
unit at an Athens hospital, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Although the new treatment does not cure AIDS, it prolongs the
AIDS patients' lives, giving scientists "precious time" for
researching the disease, Stergios said.
</P>
<P>
"The treatment has given patients hope. They are not scared
any more and are fighting back," the doctor added.
</P>
<P>
Alexis, one of the 12 AIDS patients at the hospital who have
been administered the new drugs, reportedly said he felt
rejuvenated after 26 days of treatment.
</P>
<P>
AIDS treatment is provided free of charge in Greece.

<HEADLINE> Interior Minister Opposes Rafsanjani's 3rd Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Interior Minister Ali
Mohammad Besharati today voiced his opposition to the third term
of presidency for Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, the official news
agency IRNA reported here today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement at the open session of the Parliament,
Besharati said he was opposed to an amendment to the constitution
to enable President Rafsanjani to run for the third term.
</P>
<P>
"The constitution should not be revised at the will of
certain political groups in the country," he was quoted by IRNA
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Iran's hardline Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri also
expressed his opposition to the amendment to the constitution
early this month.
</P>
<P>
"Such an amendment will not be in the interest of the Islamic
system," he noted in response to a recent call by Rafsanjani's
supporters for a nationwide referendum on amending the
constitution in a bid to seek a third term of presidency for
Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
The law in Iran does not allow a third consecutive term in
the office by Rafsanjani who is now serving his second term in
the office. His presidency will expire by July 1997.

TOKYO, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government will
take "mild measures" to ease the burden of the U.S. military bases
in Okinawa Prefecture and promote the development of the local
economy, the Kyodo's News Service reported today.
</P>

<P>
The government has given up plans to draft special legislation
to facilitate the expropriation of land in Okinawa for use by the
U.S. forces.

Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto reportedly plans to explain
the mild measures to Okinawa Governor Masahide Ota in a meeting on

<HEADLINE> Illegal Parking Adds to Traffic Congestion in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Illegal parking has become a
serious problem in Hong Kong, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
An officer of Kowloon West police said that illegal parking
contributed much to traffic congestion in the worst-affected
areas.
</P>
<P>
According to "Hong Kong Standard", in the first six months this
year, Hong Kong police issued 890,078 penalty tickets to Hong
Kong car owners and last year the police issued about 2 million
parking tickets.
</P>
<P>
The officer said that of the two figures, more than 30 percent
of the tickets were issued for illegal parking in the Kowloon West
District which consists of Yau Tsim Mong, Sham Shui Po and
Kowloon City.
</P>
<P>
He said that the lack of parking facilities and an increasing
number of construction and reclamation projects in the area
exacerbated the problem.
</P>
<P>
But the number of parking tickets issued last year have brought
about 6.2 billion HK dollars (800 million US dollars) in revenue
to the Hong Kong government, he said.

BEIJING, September 8 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese economist has
proposed that nine urban economic circles be created nationwide
around larges cities in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Wang Gang puts forward the idea in the weekly magazine

</P>
<P>
His urban circles will embrace Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei,
Shenyang-Dalian, Jilin-Heilongjiang, Jinan-Qingdao,
Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi, Chengdu-Chongqing, Pearl River Delta,
Nanjing-Hefei and Shanghai-Suzhou-Wuxi-Changzhou.
</P>
<P>
Establishment of the urban circles will help to alleviate
conflicts between urbanization and encroachment of farmland, he
said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the formation of relatively complete inner-circle
industrial structures will cut down inter-regional freight volumes
by a quarter, he added.

TEHRAN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian Parliament today
rejected a government bill on formalization of trade relations
between Iran and Jordan, an official report said here today.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Tehran Radio reported that some deputies of the
parliament were opposed to the bill because the Jordanian Kingdom
maintains good relations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the parliament decided to put the bill
aside for six months.
</P>
<P>
Jordan was a supporter of Iraq during the eight-year Iran-Iraq
war. However, the relations between Tehran and Amman began to
improve in the wake of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and at
the mediation of Syria.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between Iran and Jordan is some 5 million
U.S. dollars. Iran imports phosphate in production of fertilizer
in return for industrial and agricultural goods.
</P>

bills on the improvement and formalization of trade ties between

<HEADLINE> Syria Anxious to Maintain Unity, Integrity of Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Syrian press today
expressed the government's grave concerned over of the unity and
integrity of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Local daily Teshreen said that "Syria thinks that any violation
of the unity and integrity of the Iraqi territory is a threat to
the security of all the Arabs."
</P>
<P>
"Syria opposes the U.S. missile attacks on Iraq, considering
them as a threat to the unity of Iraqi territory and violation of
the U.N. Charter and principles," it added.
</P>
<P>
"Syria is also opposed to any Turkish action targeting the
unity of Iraq and calls on the Turkish government to reconsider
its attitude and adopt a policy of constructive dialogue and
positive cooperation with the Arabs," the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
The paper warned that the Turkish plan to set up a security
zone inside Iraq would undoubtedly contribute to instability in
the region serve the interests of neither Turkey nor those of the
Arabs and Moslems at large.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has put forward a proposal on setting up of a security
zone between five to 20 kilometers deep into the Iraqi side of the
border in an attempt to prevent the infiltrations of the Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK) into the Turkish territory.
</P>
<P>
Citing an example of the so-called security zone in south
Lebanon set up by Israel, the paper pointed out that the creation
of such zone has but given rise to grave tensions, thorny
problems and plenty of complications.
</P>
<P>
"Al-Baath", mouthpiece of the ruling Arab Baath Socialist
Party, run an editorial today opposing the so-called security zone.
</P>
<P>
The editorial emphasized that Ankara's idea of setting up a
buffer zone in the Iraqi territory would run contrary to all the
resolutions adopted at recent meetings by the foreign ministers of
Syria, Iran and Turkey, which underlined the necessity of allowing
nobody to affect or harm the unity and integrity of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the U.S. missile attacks on Iraqi targets
Tuesday and Wednesday have to a certain extent encouraged Turkey
to think of setting up the buffer zone in Iraq under the pretexts
that have nothing to do with the reality.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. air force launched cruise missiles Tuesday and
Wednesday to attack selected air defense targets in southern
Iraq to retaliate for the recent Iraqi military operations against
Kurds in northern Iraq.

sources said.
</P>
<P>
Police said that while the overall number of missing people is
falling, the proportion of those under 16 is rising steadily.
</P>
<P>
About 85 percent of missing people eventually turned up, but
the remaining 15 percent vanished without trace.
</P>
<P>
The missing persons under 16 years old made up 48 percent of
the 6,396 people reported missing in Hong Kong in 1995. But for
the first five months of this year, they represented 58 percent of
the total of 2,449.
</P>
<P>
Chow Wing-sun, social work lecturer at the University of Hong
Kong, said that many of the young runaways had family or school
problems they could not face.
</P>
<P>
He said that the steady growth in their numbers was worrying
because they were more prone to being lured into crime by triads.
</P>
<P>
Most runaways were found to have fled bad family environments
and better understanding might help prevent some cases, he said.

</P>
<P>
Hammadi made the remarks after he came out of the U.N. office

<HEADLINE> Zambian Opposition Calls for Law Amendment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Zambian opposition parties are
calling for the repealing of the public order act and have
rejected the use of voters cards prepared by the Israeli Nikuv
Computer Company for the coming general elections.
</P>
<P>
Leading members of opposition parties met on Saturday on the
eve of the resumption of the parliament session to discuss rules
governing the elections, the local newspaper "Sunday Mail"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties insisted that the public order act be
repealed to allow political parties to apply for permission a day
before holding a public meeting.
</P>
<P>
The opposition also termed the preparation of voters cards by
the Nikuv Company as a mess.
</P>
<P>
They said that they opted for the national registration cards
and that this year's elections should be held under the 1991
constitution.
</P>
<P>
In another demand, opposition leaders said that the electoral
commission must comprise seven members, two from the judiciary,
three from the political parties and two from non-governmental
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 constitution, a controversial issue between the
ruling and opposition parties, stipulates that only
the second indigenous generation Zambians are qualified to be
president of the state.
</P>
<P>
This actually bars opposition UNIP leader and former state
president K. Kaunda from running for the presidency as his
parents were immigrants from neighboring Malawi.

<HEADLINE> GCC Ministerial Meeting Fails to Applaud US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Foreign Ministers
of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) have failed to applaud the
recent U.S. missile attacks on Iraq during their first
session Saturday night, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the media reports, the ministers currently in
session in the Saudi Arabian capital of Riyadh also stopped short
of openly criticizing the United States, which is the only western
power they believe capable of defending them in case of threats by
their neighbors Iraq and Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration ordered the U.S. air force to launch
two cruise missile attacks on selected air defense targets in
southern Iraq in retaliation of Saddam Hussein's strike on the
Kurds in northern Iraq last weekend.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, the largest GCC country and main U.S. ally in
the Gulf, even asked Washington to stop the attacks for fear they
would boost Saddam's image among the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
The GCC includes Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the UAE, Qatar, Oman
and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from Kuwait, who expressed "full understanding" of
the U.S. missile strikes, was seeking support for his country's
attitude, but other delegates said this was unlikely.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait was occupied by Iraq from August 1990 to February 1991.
</P>
<P>
Omani Foreign Minister Sultan Qabus Bin Said, also chairman of
the meeting, said after the first meeting that "the issue is
sensitive and delicate."
</P>
<P>
However, he said the GCC states renewed their commitment to
the unity of the U.S.-led international alliance. "We support the
U.S.-led international alliance," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers formed a committee to work out a draft communique
explaining the GCC position with respect to the latest
developments in Iraq. The communique is expected to come out later
today.
</P>
<P>
Al-Khaleej, a daily of the United Arab Emirates, described the
U.S. strikes as "a dangerous precedent in international
relations. "Does the path to the White House have to lead through
Iraqi territory?" it asked rhetorically.
</P>
<P>
The GCC foreign minister's meeting, which is to end later today, will
issue a joint statement explaining the GCC stand on the latest
developments in the region.

<HEADLINE> Greek Cypriots Kill Turkish Soldier, Wound Another </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- A group of Greek Cypriots
shot dead one Turkish soldier and wounded another in Guvercinlik
village near Magosa in northern Cyprus, Turkish sources in
Nicosia confirmed today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the Greek Cypriots fired at the
Turkish soldiers on duty at the Security Forces Commandership of
northern Cyprus early this morning.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported that the
wounded soldier underwent an operation in the Gazimagosa State
Hospital in northern Cyprus, and is in serious conditions.
</P>
<P>
On August 14, Turkish Cypriot troops killed a Greek Cypriot
protester as he was climbing up to tear down the Turkish flag on
the edge of the northern Cyprus side.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred after the funeral of another Greek
Cypriot, Tassos Issac, 24, who was beaten to death on August 11
in clashes between the Greek Cypriot demonstrators and Turkish
troops in the 180-kilometer buffer zone controled by the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
More than 30,000 Turkish troops are stationed in northern
Cyprus to protect the Turkish Cypriots in the northern part of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when the Turkish troops
intervened following a coup supported by Athens.
</P>
<P>
Northern Cyprus leader Rauf Denktas declared independence in
the northern part of the island as "Turkish Republic of Northern
Cyprus" in 1983, but it is only recognized by Turkey.

<P>
NEW YORK, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Steffi Graf proved why she is
the world no. 1 when the current queen beat fifteen-year-old
Martina Hingis 7-5 6-3 in the U.S. Open semifinal here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Graf, a four-time Open winner, will play her
29th Grand Slam final on Sunday and eighth at Flushing Meadow when
she takes on twice Open champion Monica Seles in a re-match of
last year's final.
</P>
<P>
The second-seeded Seles outplayed fourth-seeded Spaniard
Conchita Martinez in straight sets on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Graf-Hingis match had been suspended by rain after just one
game on Friday, but the contest proved worth the wait, filled as
it was with long, exciting rallies and tense moments.
</P>
<P>
Seles and Graf, the co-number one players in the world, have
assured a monopoly on the year's major titles. Seles won her
fourth Australian Open in January and Graf scooped the French Open
and Wimbledon titles.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's match will be the first meeting between the great
rivals since last year's Open finale, a three-set thriller won by
Graf. It will also mark the first repeat of a women's final
matchup here since Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert squared off
in 1983 and 1984.

<P>
NEW YORK, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Michael Chang scored an easy
win in straight sets over long time rival Andre Agassi on Saturday
and reach the final in the U.S. Open tennis tournament.
</P>
<P>
Chang overwhelmed longtime rival Agassi with his service and
also outplayed the backcourt slugger from the baseline to

Tennis Centre.
</P>
<P>
"Things just really went well for me. Today everything
clicked," said the second-seeded Chang, who finished off the one

<P>
The second-seeded Chang will meet the winner of the day's
other semifinal between top-seeded defending champion Pete
Sampras and fourth seed Goran Ivanisevic.
</P>
<P>
Chang, who had lost to Agassi in straight sets in the hard
court finals in Cincinnati earlier this month, trailed in their
career series 11-6 and had twice been defeated at past Opens by
his longtime rival.
</P>
<P>
Chang, the Australian Open runner-up who is ranked third in the
world, could become the new world number one with a victory in
Sunday's final.

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls for Peace Talks on Iraqi Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Iran today called for peace
talks instead of military action to solve the Iraqi issue.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Vaezi, Deputy Foreign Minister for Euro-American
Affairs, told foreign ambassadors and representatives here that
the U.S. military attacks against Iraq is detrimental to peace
and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
The deputy foreign minister also condemned Iraq for dispatching
armed force and military intervention in northern Iraq and
denounced the U.S. for firing missiles on Iraqi targets.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the military action by Iraq and the United
States is not acceptable to the Islamic Republic of Iran.
</P>
<P>
Vaezi described the U.S. military action as "hasty" and
"serving U.S. presidential elections only."
</P>
<P>
Iraq sent troops to the north of the country last weekend to
attack one of the two Kurdish factions, the Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan, to help the Kurdish Democratic Party which cooperated
with the Iraqi government.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. launched more than 40 cruise missiles in two
consecutive days starting from Tuesday to strike selected air
defense targets in southern Iraq in response to Saddam Hussein's
military operations in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Vaezi also rejected the Iraqi accusation that Iran was
militarily involved in Kurdish affairs in northern Iraq, saying
"such an accusation is groundless."
</P>
<P>
He claimed that Iran had by no means interfered with the
internal affairs of Iraq. He said Iran always maintains its
respect for Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran had launched a limited military action in
northern Iraq one month before, and it was finished. "Iran holds
that it had nothing to do with the latest development," he
concluded.

</P>
<P>
Jeff Nygaard and Dan Landry combined for a 28-kill performance

<HEADLINE> China Reports Increase of Foreign Investment January to June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Some 110 countries and regions
landed investment in China during the first half of this year,
with pledged and applied foreign investment rising 47 percent and
20 percent respectively from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Growing interest in launching China operations, coupled with
some policy changes, have enticed the strong inflow of foreign
capital, today's "Business Weekly" quoted Wang Liaoping, deputy
director-general of the foreign investment administration
department under the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Co-operation (Moftec) as saying.
</P>
<P>
The 47 percent growth was partly brought by China's attempt
last April to withdraw tariff-exempt treatment of capital goods
imported by foreign-invested companies leaving an eight-month
grace period for projects worth less than 30 million US dollars
and a 20-month period for projects involving 30 million US dollars
or more each.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Wages rise on Decline in Workforce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 8 (Xinhua) -- China's industrial workforce
decreased in the first half of this year, with the average wage
level rising slowly, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, the total number of workers was 146.9
million, down 538,000 from the first quarter of this year and 2.17
million from the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Staff at the state-owned enterprises was cut down by 1.14
million, accounting for the bulk of the total reduction.
</P>
<P>
But the total employed at work units and institutions across
the country was 688 million people, up six million from the end of
last year.
</P>
<P>
"Such industrial sectors as manufacturing, mining and drilling
as well as construction were among the hardest hit by the sharp
downturn in the workforce," the paper quoted Zhang Jinsheng, a
senior researcher at the Ministry of Labor, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Zhang attributed the layoffs to corporate restructuring and
delay of some construction and investment projects caused by the
relatively tight credit policy initiated by the central bank since
last year to cap inflation.
</P>
<P>
But Zhang predicted that the remainer of this year would see a
moderate rebound in hires due to the two recent interest rate
cuts.

DHAKA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Share trading at the Dhaka Stock
Exchange (DSE), having a bull run for several weeks, surged
further Saturday and set newer records in its all major market
indicators.
</P>
<P>
The DSE all share price index Saturday gained 63.03 points
while the market capital of the bourse also rose by 4.29 billion
taka (about 120 million US dollars), according to DSE sources.
</P>
<P>
The DSE all share price index which had crossed the 1,200 mark
at the beginning of this month, jumped to 1,390.84 points Saturday
marking a record rise of more than 172 points in only six day's
brisk trading.
</P>
<P>
The market capitalization of the bourse rose by more than 10
billion taka (about 250 million US dollars) since the beginning of
this month. It reached 96.28 billion taka (about 2.4 billion US
dollars) Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A stable political situation in the country, enthusiasm among
the investors, high demand for shares compared to the supply and
influx of new capital were the main causes behind the surge in the
share market, said some market operators.
</P>
<P>
The market will boom further in future if political stability
persists, said Imtiaz Hossen, chairman of the DSE, adding that the
market is not beyond control although heavy speculation caused the
sudden rise in prices of some issues.

<HEADLINE> Peace Activists Demand Netanyahu Continue Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 8 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 members of
the Peace Now movement held a torch-light march to the residence
of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem Saturday night
urging the government to continue the peace process, Israel Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
The procession marked the third anniversary of the Oslo
agreement. The demonstrators demanded that the rightwing Likud
government honor the agreements, and in particular, carry out the
long-delayed army redeployment from the West Bank city of
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Peace Now Leader Sali Reshef accused Netanyahu of trying to
halt the process. "There is no peace process," Reshef said.
"The prime minister had a meeting with (Palestinian Authority
President) Yasser Arafat, but did his best to make it seem
unimportant."
</P>
<P>
In Tel Aviv a similar demonstration was held at the square
where ex-Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was murdered. Rabin's son
Yugal said the peace camp would support the current government if
it really takes actions to carry on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations took place on the eve of Netanyahu's
second visit to the United States. The upbeat about the
peace process, which emerged after the summit between Netanyahu
and Arafat, is appearing to be in decline among left-wing
parties and pro-peace organizations following Netanyahu hard-line
statement delivered in the Likud Central Committee meeting in
Tel Aviv on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made it clear that he had not abandoned his
long-cherished dream of the so-called "Greater Israel." He also
reiterated his opposition to the establishment of a Palestinian
state with East Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from Cairo, Egyptian leaders remain
pessimistic even after Netanyahu's first meeting with Arafat on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The point is not just meeting and shaking hands," Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Saturday. "The point is
implementing agreements and that everybody should feel that the
peace process has been reactivated."
</P>
<P>
Arafat flew to Cairo Saturday to brief President Hosni
Mubarak, Moussa and Osama Baz, Mubarak's top political adviser,
on his meeting with Netanyahu at the Cairo airport for about 45
minutes. Moussa said that Arafat was disappointed with the ensuing
developments following his summit with Netanyahu, who later told
his Likud Party hierarchy that there would never be a Palestinian
state.

<HEADLINE> Volume Three, Four and Five of Mao Zedong Works Published (5) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Biography of Mao Zedong," which covers the 1893-1949
period, with about 750,000 characters, has been compiled by the
Party Literature Research Center of the CPC Central Committee and
published by the Central Literature Publishing House.
</P>
<P>
This is the first biography of Mao Zedong ever written with the
approval by the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
The book was compiled after lengthy, detailed study on Mao's
life and philosophy, using as references a great number of
archives preserved in the Central Archives, and memoirs from
people who knew and talked with Mao, as well as current findings
on the late leader.
</P>
<P>
With abundant and reliable materials and simple, eloquent
language, the biography gives a complete account of Mao's life,
from his youth to the founding of the CPC, the Chinese People's
Liberation Army and the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
The book is also a reflection of the progress of China's
revolution in half a century.
</P>
<P>
It gives a detailed illustration of the development of his
ideas in combining the universal truth of Marxism with the
specific practice of Chinese revolution. It charts his search for
a revolutionary road with Chinese characteristics, with Mao
himself at the core of the CPC's first generation of leadership,
and reveals the historical process for the formation of the Mao
Zedong Thought -- the crystalization of the collective wisdom of
the Chinese communists.

<HEADLINE> Greek Cypriot Troops Kill Turkish Soldier, Injure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Greek Cypriot defense troops
this morning shot dead one Turkish soldier and wounded another in
Guvercinlik village near Magosa city in northern Cyprus, Turkish
sources in Nicosia told Xinhua this morning.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the Greek Cypriot soldiers fired at
the Turkish soldiers stationed in northern Cyprus at about 04:00
a.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
This fatal attack came following some other serious incidents
which occurred along the 180-kilometer buffer zone controlled by
the United Nations in August.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that it is now silent in the area and no
further developments have taken place there.
</P>
<P>
On August 14, Turkish troops shot dead a Greek Cypriot
protester as he tried to bring down the Turkish flag on the
edge of the northern Cyprus side.
</P>
<P>
The said development occurred after the funeral of another
Greek Cypriot, Tassos Issac, 24, who was beaten to death on
August 11 in clashes between the Greek Cypriot demonstrators and
Turkish troops in the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
More than 30,000 Turkish troops are stationed in northern
Cyprus to protect the Turkish Cypriots in the northern side of
the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
intervened following a coup backed by Athens in the Mediterranean
island.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots declared their independence in their part of
the island in 1983, and their self-declared republic is recognized
only by Turkey.

HARARE, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean tobacco farmers
have embarked on a programme to invest in better housing, health
and education facilities for their workers, Zimbabwe Tobacco
Association President Robert Webb has said.

<P>
"We have been running campaigns to encourage our members to

</P>
<P>
Owing to the changes in the economy in the past 16 years which
had seen the cost of labour becoming expensive, farmers now
wanted to retain the same workers over a long period so that
their production levels would remain high, according to the
association president.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco farmers will this season make better housing for the
workers a major priority, he pledged.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is either the first or second biggest exporter of

<HEADLINE> Okinawa Residents Start Voting Over U.S. Bases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Residents of Okinawa, Japan,
today started to vote in an unprecedented referendum on the huge
U.S. military presence in the country's southernmost prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Although the vote, the first held at the prefectural level, is
not legally binding, its provides the first chance for Okinawans
to express their years of frustration over the concentration of
U.S. military forces on the island.
</P>
<P>
No incidents were reported from the 302 polling stations across
 the island, which opened at 7 a.m. (2200 GMT Saturday) and were
to close at 6 p.m. (0900 GMT). There are 900,000 eligible voters.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa Governor Masahide Ota, a strong advocate of a complete
withdrawal of the U.S. troops, was one of the first to cast
ballots in the prefectural capital of Naha near the governor's
official residence early this morning.
</P>
<P>
'I'm eager to watch how strongly local residents turn out to
vote," Kyodo News quoted Ota as saying. "This is a historical
moment because it is the first time that Okinawa residents are
able to express their will over the military bases, which were
more or less forced upon us."
</P>
<P>
The referendum asks: "Do you favor or oppose a review of the
Japan-U.S. Status of Forces Agreement and the consolidation and
reduction of U.S. military bases in the prefecture?"
</P>
<P>
It is believed that most Okinawans will vote in favour of
streamlining the U.S. presence.
</P>
<P>
Today's vote is held about a year after the rape of a local
school girl by three U.S. servicemen last September, who are now
serving prison terms.
</P>
<P>
The rape spurred a renewed anti-U.S. base sentiments in the
island, and Governor Ota has spearheaded a campaign against the
Japanese central government by refusing to carry out procedures
for the continued forced leases of privately-owned land to the
U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
The referendum follows a Supreme Court ruling last month that
recognized the Japanese government's expropriation of land for use
by the U.S.troops as constitutional and rejected Ota's appeal
against a lower court decision ordering him to sign the documents
needed for the continued land rental.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa has about 28,000, or 60 percent of the 45,300
U.S. soldiers and 75 percent of all U.S. military facilities in
Japan.
</P>
<P>
The debate has also become a major political problem for
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>
He has indicated that the result of the Okinawa vote is a
major factor in his decision on whether or not to call early
general elections.
</P>
<P>
Japan has never held a referendum and none of the country's 47
prefectures have ever held a provincial one, over any issue.

<HEADLINE> Volume Three, Four and Five of Mao Zedong Works Published (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Collection of Poems of Mao Zedong" has been compiled by
the Party Literature Research Center of the CPC Central Committee
and published by the Central Literature Publishing House.
</P>
<P>
It contains 67 poems, ten of which have been published for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
One poem was written in 1943 during the War of Resistance
against Japanese Aggression (1937-1945) and another in 1947,
during the War of Liberation (1946-1949). The two works make up
for the lack of Mao's poems during the two periods covered in the
collection of "Selected Poems of Mao Zedong," which was published
previously.
</P>
<P>
Several poems written in the mid-1950s reveal a new, pastoral
style in Mao's works. Two poems were written in 1961 in memory of
Lu Xun, a great Chinese man of letters who was active in the early
decades of the century.
</P>
<P>
One poem written in 1966 foreshadows Mao's ideas about
launching the "Cultural Revolution" (1966-1976).
</P>
<P>
The collection adds more notes to the "Selected Poems of Mao
Zedong," published in 1986, and corrects errors in original notes.
</P>
<P>
The appendix includes some of Mao's letters and written remarks
on his poems, which help readers correctly understand the poems.
</P>
<P>
The collection is the most authoritative book on Mao's poems in
China, indicating his achievement as a poet. It is considered an
important component for the study of Mao's poems and his
philosophies.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is stepping up health
checks on illegal migrants allowed to work in the country to
prevent re-emergency of certain communicable diseases in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
According to guidelines issued by the Public Health Ministry, a
Myanmar, Cambodian or Laotian migrant worker will be barred from
working in Thailand and repatriated if found to have diseases like
mental disorders, leprosy, tuberculosis, elephantiasis and
syphilis.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has provided a list of authorized health
establishments to business operators in about 40 of the country's
76 provinces, and any results issued by unauthorized hospitals or
clinics will not be accepted.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that Thai health officials especially
expressed concerns over the possible re-emergency of diseases in
Thailand, like elephantiasis which remains a threat in neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey in Tak province showed 2 to 6 percent of
Myanmar workers suffered from the disease, which may be spread by
mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
The Thai cabinet earlier this year made resolutions to allow
foreign migrants to work legally in Thailand for a period of two
years in a bid to solve the country's labor shortage problem.
</P>
<P>
According to the resolutions, the registration and health
checks must be done before November 29.

BANGKOK, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Thai national security council
chief Charan Kullavanijaya said here Saturday that Thailand had
always wanted all the rival factions in Cambodia to settle their
differences in a peaceful manner, local news paper Bangkok Post

</P>
<P>
"We used to tell them to look to our example of how we solved
our own insurgency problem by granting amnesty to the insurgents
and welcoming them back for nation-building. Killing one another
will not solve the problem," he said.

He said Thailand will not broker reconciliation talks between
Khmer Rouge dissident led by Ieng Sary and the Phnom Penh
government unless it is invited to do so.
</P>

Charan dismissed as unlikely a report that Thailand would be

On Myanmar, Charan said SLORC and the Myanmar people should be
given a chance to settle their own problem in a peaceful manner
without outside interference.

Too much interference would render the Myanmar government

15 are literate in the country today compared to the situation

However, he regretted that women's literacy has not improved

international non-governmental organizations to help people learn
reading and writing.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Debt Obstructs Mexico's Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's foreign debt is
nearing 180 billion U.S. dollars and interest will accrue to 15
billion dollars by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
This obstructs Mexico's economic growth, because the payment of
interest makes up 6 percent of its annual gross domestic product
(GDP), Mexican economist Macario Schettino warned here recently.
</P>
<P>
He said the international reserves crisis erupted in the
country last year due to the monstrous cost of the short-term
government bonds indexed to the exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
Mexico must renegotiate its foreign debt by halving the debt
interest and postponing the payment of the principal as long as

<HEADLINE> Russia Concerned Over Turkey-Planned "Buffer Zone" in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Russia is very concerned with a
"buffer zone" planned by Turkey to be established in Iraq's
northern Kurdish region.
</P>
<P>
The move will seriously damage the territorial integrity of a
sovereign state and cause further instability in the region,
Itar-Tass said today, quoting a statement of the Russian Foreign
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Russia urged Turkey to give up such a plan which threatens the
security not only of Iraq, but also of other countries around the
region, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
It added stopping war and restoring dialogues between rival
Kurdish factions and between Kurds and the Iraqi government are
ways to normalize situation in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller Friday said the
planned buffer zone will deter infiltration from Iraq by the army
of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), fighting for self-rule in
Turkey's Kurdish southeast.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish troops reportedly have been massing on the border
with Iraq to create the planned security zone up to 10 kilometers
deep in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher has said
in London that the United States understands Turkey's reasons for
establishing such a zone and has been assured it would be
temporary and involve no permanent troops.
</P>
<P>
But France and Syria have opposed the plan while Iraq has said
it "unacceptable."

<HEADLINE> Trial Elections to Be Held in Mindanao Tomorrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- About 970,000 voters will cast
their ballots in tomorrow's gubernatorial elections in the
autonomous region in Muslim Mindanao and a former Muslim rebel
leader is expected to be elected governor of the region.
</P>
<P>
According to the Philippine Commission on Elections, 105
candidates are running for the 21 seats in the legislative
assembly of the four-province autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
Nur Misuari, chairman of the Moro National Liberation Front
(MNLF), is considered virtually elected as governor of the region
because he is the sole candidate for the governorship.
</P>
<P>
After reaching an interim peace agreement with the government
in June, Misuari was endorsed by the ruling Lakas-NUCD (National
Union of Christian Democrats) as its candidate for the governor.
</P>
<P>
The former rebel leader will also be nominated as chairman of
the Southern Philippines Council for Peace and Development after
the gubernatorial elections. Under the final peace agreement
signed by the government and the MNLF last week, the MNLF-led
council will oversee peace and development in 14 provinces and
nine cities in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The council will serve as a transitional body leading to a new
and broader autonomous region in Mindanao in three years' time.
</P>
<P>
Election commission officials said that as 60 percent of the
candidates for the assembly seats are from 13 political clans,
violence among their supporters may erupt during tomorrow's
elections.
</P>
<P>
But President Fidel Ramos said Friday that elections in the
region could be clean, orderly and peaceful since Misuari is
participating in the elections.

<TEXT>
<P>
The third volume (January 1943 to August 1945), the fourth
volume (September 1945 to December 1947), and the fifth volume
(January 1948 to September 1949), contain articles written by Mao
before the founding of New China. Many of the articles in the
three volumes are being published for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The three volumes are of great theoretical and literary value
to the understanding and study of the development of Mao's ideas
from the late period of the War of Resistance against Japanese
Aggression to the eve of the founding of New China. They include
the fundamental theories of new democracy, the CPC's basic line,
strategy and tactics for the democratic revolution and a series of
specific policies.
</P>
<P>
The third volume has 77 articles with a total of 290,000
Chinese characters. The articles mainly deal with the
Rectification Movement, which was instituted to improve the CPC's
work; summarizing the CPC's historical experience; establishing
the ideological line and outlining the nine-point principle
concerning the examination of CPC cadres; summarizing the
experience of the bases to resist Japanese aggression in
consolidating political power, in handling the land issue and in
economic, cultural and education work, and putting forward the ten
major policies on building such bases.
</P>
<P>
The articles also expose and refute the third anti-Communist
wave launched by the Kuomintang die-hards to sabotage unity; deal
with the convocation of the CPC Seventh National Congress; outline
the guiding principle of "Uniting as one and striving for victory"
for the congress; and formulate a correct line and tactics for
defeating Japanese invaders and founding New China.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Officials Discuss Ways to Attract Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Government investment
officials will present a report to Southeast Asian economic
ministers next week on ways to boost investment in the region,
ASEAN Secretary-General Ajit Singh said.
</P>
<P>
In a statement received this morning, Singh said the officials
discussed a framework for an ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian
Nations) investment area (AIA) during a three-day meeting ending
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN leaders gave their support to an AIA at their summit in
Bangkok last year.
</P>
<P>
The investment report will be presented to the ASEAN economic
ministers at their annual meeting next Thursday following a
meeting of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) Council on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Singh said the aim was to "facilitate and liberalize investment
measures in ASEAN" to boost both inter-ASEAN investment and
foreign investment from outside the region.
</P>
<P>
"The concern is that with all the other regions becoming
competitive, ASEAN has to remain attractive and be among the
best," he said.
</P>
<P>
The investment meeting is one of a series of gatherings in
preparation for next week's economic ministers' meeting.
</P>
<P>
Customs officials last Thursday completed a legal framework for
customs cooperation in ASEAN covering the harmonization of tariff
nomenclature, customs valuation and customs procedures in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Singh said the customs agreement, which now must be signed by
the appropriate ministers, would help facilitate trade within
ASEAN and give private business a point of reference when dealing
with customs matters.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Volumes three, four and five
of "The Works of Mao Zedong" have been published.
</P>
<P>
Also published are the "Collection of Mao Zedong Poems," the
"Biography of Mao Zedong (1893-1949)" and the "Collection of

Mao died on September 9, 1976. Shaoshan, in Xiangtan County,
central China's Hunan Province, is Mao's home town.

Research Center of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) and published by the People's Publishing House.
</P>
<P>
"The Works of Mao Zedong" contains important articles not

Zedong." The articles were selected from among the many
manuscripts of the late chairman covering a period from 1921 to
1976.

Articles in it serve as the extension of and important
supplement to the four volumes of "The Selected Works of Mao
Zedong." All major works of Mao Zedong after the founding of New
China in 1949 are contained in the "Works of Mao Zedong," which
serves as a collection of important works for studying Mao's
philosophies.

The first volume of "Works of Mao Zedong," which covers the
period from January 1921 to June 1937, and the second volume
(August 1937 to December 1942), were published in December 1993 to
