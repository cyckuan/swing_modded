<P>
   Part of what has made e-commerce one of the most compelling
spectator sports of the year is this fact: No matter how much
experience executives have had running multimillion-dollar
companies in other industries, when it comes to Web retailing, many
of them are still making things up as they go along.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point is anticipating and preparing for changing
traffic patterns on the World Wide Web. While traditional retailers
can say precisely when and why their customers arrive -- and can
maximize their efficiency accordingly -- Internet merchants have
frequently been caught by surprise in the past year by traffic
surges.
</P>
<P>
   As e-commerce merchants brace for their second meaningful
holiday shopping season, however, they are beginning to decipher
some of the rhythms of their Internet shoppers. Namely, while Web
traffic in general becomes heavier as the day goes on, many
Internet retailers report that traffic is actually heaviest during
the middle of the day, between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. EST -- suggesting
that workers blessed with high-speed Internet connections remain
anchored to their desks at lunch time, sandwich in one hand, mouse
in the other.
</P>
<P>
   So, with the holidays rapidly approaching, some retailers are
shoring up their sites' technological infrastructure and hoping
they have enough capacity to handle the midday traffic smoothly.
Others, meanwhile, are looking beyond the back-office technology
issues into marketing opportunities presented by the 9-to-5 set.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, not every retail site is subjected to the same
midday shopping rush, analysts and executives said, because other
factors help determine the peaks as well. The type of goods sold
and the type of consumer the company attracts, for example, can
also affect a site's traffic patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lower-consideration purchases like books, gifts or flowers are
much more likely to be made during the daytime hours, since people
tend to see those things as a task that can be done quickly,'' said
Melissa Shore, an analyst with Jupiter Communications. ``With
things like computers, people will do a lot of research and then go
home and talk it over with their significant other or see if it's
compatible with their system, then go online and buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Travelocity, a travel site owned by the AMR Corp. that recently
announced a merger agreement with Preview Travel, peaks at 3 p.m.
EST, according to Terrell Jones, Travelocity's president. ``There
are a lot of busy dual-income families who can't book something at
night, when most travel agents are closed,'' he said.''And the
high-speed access at work certainly has an effect.''
</P>
<P>
   But marketing is also a factor, Jones said. Preview Travel
advertises heavily on America Online, which has heavier traffic
during the evening hours. ``So Preview's activity tends to be later
also. We're on Yahoo, which tends to peak earlier in the day,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Handling those peaks, of course, requires resources. Just as
brick-and-mortar stores plan for heavier shopping times by
scheduling more staff, Internet retailers need to rely on more
technology and personnel to get them through the rush. The great
fear of all Web merchants is that a traffic surge will catch them
by surprise -- landing them in the inauspicious company of Ebay,
Toysrus.com and ETrade as examples of sites that have occasionally
failed to handle their own peak loads.
</P>
<P>
   But even if a surge in users does not result in a system crash,
it can slow down the performance of a Web site sharply and alienate
potential customers. ``Our primary concern is making sure we can
handle all the traffic that doesn't come evenly,'' said Gabe Fried,
manager of research at Toysmart, an online toy retailer. That job,
he said, is complicated by the fact that traffic trends can change
quickly in response to marketing efforts, like an early-morning
promotion Toysmart recently began with Sesame Street.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign yielded ``a rather large shift in our peak hours
and processing hours,'' Fried said, but with beneficial results:
the site's traffic is now distributed more evenly through the day.
``That's better for us because it means less of a load on our
servers,'' he said, ``and better for users because the fewer of
them we have at one time, the faster the site is.''
</P>
<P>
   Web sites with less predictable traffic patterns could be in for
a long holiday season, said Jeff Nickerson, a partner in the
electronic business practice at PricewaterhouseCoopers. ``Last
holiday season, there were a lot of sites that were shocked, and
the consumers were a bit forgiving,'' he said. ``This time around,
there are so many more merchants that if stuff doesn't perform
well, sites will lose money big time.''
</P>
<P>
   More aggressive Web retailers, meanwhile, are looking into ways
to cash in on Internet users' lunchtime shopping habits.
Brookstone, which sells through its Web site, catalogs and stores,
is planning a radio advertising campaign that may include lunchtime
advertising, a spokesman said. Others are considering scheduling
more banner advertisements to be displayed on various Web pages
during lunchtime.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike radio and television broadcasters, however, not every
Internet publisher -- not even America Online -- has the
technological means to serve a banner ad for a specific time slot.
</P>
<P>
   But the technology is available. The Internet advertising
company Doubleclick enables the 8,000 sites in its network -- and
others that license the company's technology -- to serve ads
whenever they want, a company spokeswoman said. Thus far, she said,
the service has been most popular with financial advertisers, which
typically want their ads to appear mainly between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could argue that, yes, it does matter,'' said Nickerson,
of PricewaterhouseCoopers. ``People are more likely to buy during
these times than in other parts of the day. It's like the Internet
rush hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Since so many people are shopping at work, one would expect the
companies already involved with workplace Internet access to seek a
piece of the action. According to Ms. Shore of Jupiter, they may
get it. She predicted that e-commerce sites would start joining
forces with companies that set up intranet sites for corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say Amazon partnered with Peoplesoft, which puts
together a customized intranet for Time Warner,'' she said.
``Amazon could get massive exposure to Time Warner's employees, and
Time Warner could get discounts from Amazon that they could pass
onto their employees as a benefit. It makes sense for everyone.''

MCCAIN RIDING REFORM ISSUE, CHALLENGES RIVALS TO TAKE STAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KRIS MAYES  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Arizona Sen. John McCain is trying to run a
presidential campaign and at the same time reform the U.S.
political system, rather like trying to shoe the horse as he rides
it.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain is determined to turn that apparent disadvantage into
an opportunity, his aides say, by taking the issue on the campaign
trail and outflanking his political opponents with it every chance
he gets.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, McCain will take his first stab, challenging his
GOP competitors on the eve of a debate in New Hampshire to support
a plan to fund an education voucher program by eliminating
subsidies for oil, sugar, gas and ethanol.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan is to ask each Republican to stand with the children
of America rather than corporate America,'' said Dan Schnur,
McCain's communications director.
</P>
<P>
   Despite polls showing that campaign finance reform remains low
on the radar screens of most voters, McCain is betting he can make
it resonate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to reform education, if you want to reform the
military, if you want to reform the tax code, the gateway to that
is campaign finance reform,'' McCain told ``The Republic'' recently
during a break from the debate on the Senate floor on his doomed
campaign finance reform bill. ``Clearly, reform is a major theme of
the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, it remains uncertain whether campaign finance
reform is helping McCain get any additional traction in his
presidential race. Texas Gov. George W. Bush pays it only glancing
attention. And campaign observers say voters, too, pay the issue
little heed.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the Senate, the issue earned McCain the scorn of his
fellow Republicans, who lashed out at him for attempting to ban the
very contributions that have helped propel the GOP into control of
the nation's two legislative chambers for the first time in two
generations.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, a handful of
Republicans lacerated McCain for accusing them of corruption on his
campaign Web site and in speeches on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   McCain sloughed off the personal nature of last week's debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through much more difficult times than temper
tantrums from Mitch McConnell,'' McCain shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   The surprisingly nasty battle was grounded in McCain's race for
the GOP presidential nomination, he believed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Presidential politics clearly plays a role in this,'' McCain
said. ``The prospect of President McCain vetoing and going after
pork-barrel spending is not their fondest hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, McCain said, he's not just making a play to voters. This
has been his top issue for a long time and will continue to be, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain isn't sure he'll bring the bill back up next year so
close to a presidential election. And he won't speculate on its
effect on his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to do what I think is right and then, when it's over,
assess the impact,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Richard Pious, a political scientist at Columbia
University, said McCain's leadership on the campaign finance reform
bill is responsible for McCain's political fortunes ``in their
entirety.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill, Pious said, establishes McCain's credentials as ``a
maverick, as a good-government progressive, as someone who can be
effective on the character issue.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's aides make no secret of their intention to cash in on
the issue, which, while bringing the wrath of McCain's Senate
friends down on him, also garnered him a steady stream of
headlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of ways, this issue is a domestic-policy version of
Kosovo,'' Schnur said. ``It gives John McCain extraordinarily high
exposure, but more importantly it gives him exposure in the context
of public policy, not campaign politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, a number of observers believe the boost McCain gets
will be minimal at best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Campaign finance isn't on the radar screen of most
Americans,'' said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political scientist at
Claremont University.
</P>
<P>
   The issue may give McCain some outsider status with voters but
won't add much fuel to a campaign, she said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's chief rival for the nomination, Bush, seems to sense
that. The front-runner in the race, he has ignored McCain's reform
bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, McCain sent Bush a letter exhorting him to join
the fight against big money and urge the GOP Senate caucus to vote
for his bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign responded by saying it would send McCain a
Bush bumper sticker.
</P>
<P>
   During a campaign stop last Monday in Phoenix, Bush reiterated
his opposition to McCain's bill.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush said he's against soft-money contributions, he's
more interested in instant disclosure of contributions and
``paycheck protection'' for labor union members, meaning that
unions can't give dues money to political parties without asking
their members.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm for is raising the individual limits and instant
disclosure,'' Bush said. ``I'm the only candidate in the race for
president who has got near real-time disclosure on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain aides are quick to attack the Bush campaign's seeming
disregard for reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate to see a candidate or his campaign treat a
serious issue with such disdain,'' Schnur said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the campaign reform issue is helping him, McCain
is picking up speed in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   An American Research Group poll released this week in New
Hampshire showed that McCain had again advanced on Bush, garnering
26 percent support to Bush's 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And some observers say Elizabeth Dole's departure from the race
Wednesday gives McCain a clearer shot at the front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, McCain's admirers say, he'll score points
over more cautious candidates because he's jumping into the midst
of controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a risk-averse campaign so far, and he (McCain)
hasn't been,'' said GOP pollster Kellyanne Fitzpatrick. ``It's not
a popular position within his own party, and I think when it's
explained to Americans, it's not a popular position, either. But
they will credit the man who steps into the ring wearing red to
face the bull.'' &QL;

`BEST MAN' GETS BETTER OF `FORCES'
</HEADLINE>
 BC- MOVIES_BOX_OFFICE -LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Matrimonial comedy ruled at the nation's multiplexes as ``The
Best Man'' easily won the top box office spot with an estimated
$9.1 &UR;  &LR; million at 1,346 theaters during a moderate Friday-Sunday
period, studio sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Universal's ``The Best Man,'' in an echo of the late-summer
success of ``Runaway Bride,'' took in an impressive $6,766
per-theater average.
</P>
<P>
   The tale of a group of African-American friends at a wedding
party generated the only solid business among the half-dozen new
films despite being shown at the fewest theaters of any Top 10
film.
</P>
<P>
   The film, produced by Spike Lee and directed by his cousin
Malcolm Lee, stars Taye Diggs as a writer whose novel creates chaos
when members of the wedding party discover the book borrows heavily
from their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The gross was the lowest for a No. &UR;  &LR; 1 film this year, replacing
the $9.4 &UR;  &LR; million weekend for ``Forces of Nature,'' and came during
what is traditionally a slow moviegoing period with competition
from baseball's World Series and the height of the football season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't expect big numbers this time of year, so the gross
for `The Best Man' is pretty respectable,'' said industry tracker
Arthur Rockwell.
</P>
<P>
   Studio distribution chief Nikki Rocco said she was thrilled by
the performance and cited an aggressive e-mail campaign and strong
sales by the movie's soundtrack album as key factors in winning the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source tracking service,
said Universal's campaign had been able to attract
African-Americans and the date crowd. ``The audience for this film
is usually not tapped into as much it should be,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum noted ``The Best Man'' performed similarly to another
comedy with parallel themes, Paramount's ``The Wood,'' which opened
in mid-July with $8.5 &UR;  &LR; million at 1,191 theaters on its way to a
final $24.5 &UR;  &LR; million gross.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount's ``Double Jeopardy'' solidified its status as the top
fall film by finishing second in its fifth weekend, declining only
25 &UR;  &LR; percent to $7.7 &UR;  &LR; million at 3,002 theaters to push its 31-day
gross past $91 &UR;  &LR; million. ``Jeopardy'' easily outdistanced 20th
Century Fox's second weekend of ``Fight Club,'' which faded quickly
from first to third with a 42 &UR;  &LR; percent decline to $6.3 &UR;  &LR; million at
1,966 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount's opening of Martin Scorsese's gritty ambulance-driver
drama ``Bringing Out the Dead,'' which carried the strongest
reviews of the new films, followed in fourth with an adequate
$6.2 &UR;  &LR; million at 1,936 sites. The studio noted the debut is similar
to those of two other Scorsese films _ ``The Color of Money'' and
``Goodfellas'' _ each of which went on to gross more than
$40 &UR;  &LR; million.
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum said exit polls for ``Dead'' generated positive
response, adding that expectations were not particularly high
within the industry. ``Films released this time of year are not
expected to do that well,'' he said. ``Most of them will be
obsolete by the time the big holiday films start coming out next
month.''
</P>
<P>
   Universal's second weekend of ``The Story of Us'' took a
43 &UR;  &LR; percent hit to finish fifth with $5.5 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,166 sites,
edging DreamWorks' sixth weekend of emerging Academy Awards
contender ``American Beauty'' with $5.4 &UR;  &LR; million at 1,459 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beauty'' has hit nearly $49 &UR;  &LR; million and could double that
should stars Kevin Spacey and Annette Benning receive Oscar
nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Two new entries, each carrying some of the year's most
blistering reviews, battled for seventh with Warner Bros.' romantic
comedy ``Three to Tango'' taking $4.7 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,234 theaters to
edge Destination Films' scare-fest ``Bats'' with $4.6 &UR;  &LR; million at
2,549 locations.
</P>

`BEST MAN' GETS BETTER OF `FORCES'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Matrimonial comedy ruled at the nation's multiplexes as ``The
Best Man'' easily won the top box office spot with an estimated
$9.1 &UR;  &LR; million at 1,346 theaters during a moderate Friday-Sunday
period, studio sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Universal's ``The Best Man,'' in an echo of the late-summer
success of ``Runaway Bride,'' took in an impressive $6,766
per-theater average.
</P>
<P>
   The tale of a group of African-American friends at a wedding
party generated the only solid business among the half-dozen new
films despite being shown at the fewest theaters of any Top 10
film.
</P>
<P>
   The film, produced by Spike Lee and directed by his cousin
Malcolm Lee, stars Taye Diggs as a writer whose novel creates chaos
when members of the wedding party discover the book borrows heavily
from their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The gross was the lowest for a No. &UR;  &LR; 1 film this year, replacing
the $9.4 &UR;  &LR; million weekend for ``Forces of Nature,'' and came during
what is traditionally a slow moviegoing period with competition
from baseball's World Series and the height of the football season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't expect big numbers this time of year, so the gross
for `The Best Man' is pretty respectable,'' said industry tracker
Arthur Rockwell.
</P>
<P>
   Studio distribution chief Nikki Rocco said she was thrilled by
the performance and cited an aggressive e-mail campaign and strong
sales by the movie's soundtrack album as key factors in winning the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source tracking service,
said Universal's campaign had been able to attract
African-Americans and the date crowd. ``The audience for this film
is usually not tapped into as much it should be,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum noted ``The Best Man'' performed similarly to another
comedy with parallel themes, Paramount's ``The Wood,'' which opened
in mid-July with $8.5 &UR;  &LR; million at 1,191 theaters on its way to a
final $24.5 &UR;  &LR; million gross.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount's ``Double Jeopardy'' solidified its status as the top
fall film by finishing second in its fifth weekend, declining only
25 &UR;  &LR; percent to $7.7 &UR;  &LR; million at 3,002 theaters to push its 31-day
gross past $91 &UR;  &LR; million. ``Jeopardy'' easily outdistanced 20th
Century Fox's second weekend of ``Fight Club,'' which faded quickly
from first to third with a 42 &UR;  &LR; percent decline to $6.3 &UR;  &LR; million at
1,966 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount's opening of Martin Scorsese's gritty ambulance-driver
drama ``Bringing Out the Dead,'' which carried the strongest
reviews of the new films, followed in fourth with an adequate
$6.2 &UR;  &LR; million at 1,936 sites. The studio noted the debut is similar
to those of two other Scorsese films _ ``The Color of Money'' and
``Goodfellas'' _ each of which went on to gross more than
$40 &UR;  &LR; million.
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum said exit polls for ``Dead'' generated positive
response, adding that expectations were not particularly high
within the industry. ``Films released this time of year are not
expected to do that well,'' he said. ``Most of them will be
obsolete by the time the big holiday films start coming out next
month.''
</P>
<P>
   Universal's second weekend of ``The Story of Us'' took a
43 &UR;  &LR; percent hit to finish fifth with $5.5 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,166 sites,
edging DreamWorks' sixth weekend of emerging Academy Awards
contender ``American Beauty'' with $5.4 &UR;  &LR; million at 1,459 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beauty'' has hit nearly $49 &UR;  &LR; million and could double that
should stars Kevin Spacey and Annette Benning receive Oscar
nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Two new entries, each carrying some of the year's most
blistering reviews, battled for seventh with Warner Bros.' romantic
comedy ``Three to Tango'' taking $4.7 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,234 theaters to
edge Destination Films' scare-fest ``Bats'' with $4.6 &UR;  &LR; million at
2,549 locations.
</P>
<P>
   Holdovers took the last two spots with Warner's fourth weekend
of ``Three Kings'' with $4.4 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,411 theaters to edge
Disney's 12th weekend of late-summer smash ``The Sixth Sense'' with

MCCAIN RIDING REFORM ISSUE, CHALLENGES RIVALS TO TAKE STAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KRIS MAYES  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Arizona Sen. John McCain is trying to run a
presidential campaign and at the same time reform the U.S.
political system, rather like trying to shoe the horse as he rides
it.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain is determined to turn that apparent disadvantage into
an opportunity, his aides say, by taking the issue on the campaign
trail and outflanking his political opponents with it every chance
he gets.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, McCain will take his first stab, challenging his
GOP competitors on the eve of a debate in New Hampshire to support
a plan to fund an education voucher program by eliminating
subsidies for oil, sugar, gas and ethanol.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan is to ask each Republican to stand with the children
of America rather than corporate America,'' said Dan Schnur,
McCain's communications director.
</P>
<P>
   Despite polls showing that campaign finance reform remains low
on the radar screens of most voters, McCain is betting he can make
it resonate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to reform education, if you want to reform the
military, if you want to reform the tax code, the gateway to that
is campaign finance reform,'' McCain told ``The Republic'' recently
during a break from the debate on the Senate floor on his doomed
campaign finance reform bill. ``Clearly, reform is a major theme of
the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, it remains uncertain whether campaign finance
reform is helping McCain get any additional traction in his
presidential race. Texas Gov. George W. Bush pays it only glancing
attention. And campaign observers say voters, too, pay the issue
little heed.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the Senate, the issue earned McCain the scorn of his
fellow Republicans, who lashed out at him for attempting to ban the
very contributions that have helped propel the GOP into control of
the nation's two legislative chambers for the first time in two
generations.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, a handful of
Republicans lacerated McCain for accusing them of corruption on his
campaign Web site and in speeches on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   McCain sloughed off the personal nature of last week's debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through much more difficult times than temper
tantrums from Mitch McConnell,'' McCain shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   The surprisingly nasty battle was grounded in McCain's race for
the GOP presidential nomination, he believed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Presidential politics clearly plays a role in this,'' McCain
said. ``The prospect of President McCain vetoing and going after
pork-barrel spending is not their fondest hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, McCain said, he's not just making a play to voters. This
has been his top issue for a long time and will continue to be, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain isn't sure he'll bring the bill back up next year so
close to a presidential election. And he won't speculate on its
effect on his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to do what I think is right and then, when it's over,
assess the impact,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Richard Pious, a political scientist at Columbia
University, said McCain's leadership on the campaign finance reform
bill is responsible for McCain's political fortunes ``in their
entirety.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill, Pious said, establishes McCain's credentials as ``a
maverick, as a good-government progressive, as someone who can be
effective on the character issue.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's aides make no secret of their intention to cash in on
the issue, which, while bringing the wrath of McCain's Senate
friends down on him, also garnered him a steady stream of
headlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of ways, this issue is a domestic-policy version of
Kosovo,'' Schnur said. ``It gives John McCain extraordinarily high
exposure, but more importantly it gives him exposure in the context
of public policy, not campaign politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, a number of observers believe the boost McCain gets
will be minimal at best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Campaign finance isn't on the radar screen of most
Americans,'' said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political scientist at
Claremont University.
</P>
<P>
   The issue may give McCain some outsider status with voters but
won't add much fuel to a campaign, she said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's chief rival for the nomination, Bush, seems to sense
that. The front-runner in the race, he has ignored McCain's reform
bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, McCain sent Bush a letter exhorting him to join
the fight against big money and urge the GOP Senate caucus to vote
for his bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign responded by saying it would send McCain a
Bush bumper sticker.
</P>
<P>
   During a campaign stop last Monday in Phoenix, Bush reiterated
his opposition to McCain's bill.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush said he's against soft-money contributions, he's
more interested in instant disclosure of contributions and
``paycheck protection'' for labor union members, meaning that
unions can't give dues money to political parties without asking
their members.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm for is raising the individual limits and instant
disclosure,'' Bush said. ``I'm the only candidate in the race for
president who has got near real-time disclosure on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain aides are quick to attack the Bush campaign's seeming
disregard for reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate to see a candidate or his campaign treat a
serious issue with such disdain,'' Schnur said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the campaign reform issue is helping him, McCain
is picking up speed in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   An American Research Group poll released this week in New
Hampshire showed that McCain had again advanced on Bush, garnering
26 percent support to Bush's 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And some observers say Elizabeth Dole's departure from the race
Wednesday gives McCain a clearer shot at the front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, McCain's admirers say, he'll score points
over more cautious candidates because he's jumping into the midst
of controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a risk-averse campaign so far, and he (McCain)
hasn't been,'' said GOP pollster Kellyanne Fitzpatrick. ``It's not
a popular position within his own party, and I think when it's
explained to Americans, it's not a popular position, either. But
they will credit the man who steps into the ring wearing red to
face the bull.'' &QL;

CALL HIM FATHER ANTI-TIME: MILLIONAIRE INVESTS IN STRUGGLE AGAINST
AGING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN WEST  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Like most people, Bobbie Clift doesn't enjoy growing
old.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most, she's doing something about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing better than to feel like you're not growing
old,'' said Clift, 39, a Nashville businesswoman.
</P>
<P>
   It's such a good feeling, in fact, that Clift now flies to
Phoenix three times a year and pays thousands annually for
treatments at an anti-aging clinic opened recently by Phoenix-area
millionaire John Sperling.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling, 78, founder of the University of Phoenix, plans to
open nine upscale ``age-management'' clinics in Arizona and
California, and to invest at least a million dollars a year into
aging research.
</P>
<P>
   The first Kronos Clinic _ named for the Greek god of time _
opened in Phoenix; the second is scheduled to open in Scottsdale in
the Phoenix area in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts on aging scoff at such efforts _ similar clinics
have sprung up elsewhere _ saying there is no conclusive evidence
that aging can be retarded. They also question the treatments' high
cost.
</P>
<P>
   But not Clift. She said she'd been frustrated because, despite
aggressive exercise and nutrition, she felt her performance levels
slipping.
</P>
<P>
   After six months of Kronos treatment, she said, her energy level
is back up to her adult prime, ``my lung capacity is now back to
where it was when I was 30,'' and her skin and face have a more
``youthful glow.''
</P>
<P>
   But fighting Father Time doesn't come cheap. Because she takes
human growth hormone injections, Clift's regimen costs $12,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I don't buy a new car this year,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The willingness of Clift and aging baby boomers to spend freely
for extended youth is not lost on Sperling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I wouldn't mind making another billion,'' he said,
adding that the clinics will first be marketed to affluent women,
40 to 65 _ the group that has already made vitamins, herbs,
wellness and workout spas a multibillion-dollar industry.
</P>
<P>
   But Sperling said he also sees the business as an opportunity to
make a contribution to humanity as more than just the wealthy
benefit from the treatments and the research.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling hopes his clinics will help change the way people age
by showing them how to prevent potential health problems. He
believes the idea of using doctors to stay well, instead of waiting
to treat illness, may yet catch on with the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is mass disaffection with traditional medicine now,'' he
said. ``Many doctors are as fed up as the patients.''
</P>
<P>
   But the clinics are only part of the story, he said. Sperling
has also dedicated a minimum of $1 million annually for the Kronos
Foundation to underwrite university-based aging research projects
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   He has conferred with top scientific experts on aging and is
currently sorting through proposals in such diverse areas as
age-related DNA damage, oxidative stress and hormone replacement
therapies. Among his recent visitors was researcher Michael Rose of
the University of California-Irvine, who has earned international
acclaim for DNA work that has doubled the life span of laboratory
fruit flies.
</P>
<P>
   In the clinic, doctors will conduct up to 150 tests on each
patient to help design individualized programs for general health,
appearance and longevity.
</P>
<P>
   After a consultation covering lifestyle and family history,
patients are given tests to examine hormone levels, oxidative
stress and cancer risks.
</P>
<P>
   The cost is $1,200. A complete workup to assess cardiac health
is $1,600. The doctors may prescribe nutritional changes, lifestyle
changes, vitamins, antioxidants and hormones _ programs that
generally can cost from $120 to $800 per month.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic pharmacy will individualize vitamin formulas
according to each person's deficiencies and biochemistry.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling has recruited big names to Kronos. Leading his research
effort will be Dr. Richard Cutler, a pioneer in gerontology.
</P>
<P>
   Cardiologist Dr. Tali Arik, president of the Kronos Group, said,
``Ask most doctors why you are getting old, and they won't have an
answer. But that's not the case with our doctors here.''
</P>
<P>
   Being a pioneer has its price: Arik says some of his peers look
askance at his joining Kronos.
</P>
<P>
   But he and two other doctors who have joined, Dr. Charlotte
DeHaven from Mesa Lutheran and Dr. Cheryl Shafer, formerly of Mayo
Clinic, say they're practicing the best kind of medicine:
prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Does Sperling want to double his own life span?
</P>
<P>
   Well, he'd like to live to 100, if he stays healthy _ which he
tries to do by following an age-management program designed for him
that includes four or five customized vitamin and mineral capsules
per day as well as plenty of exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Shafer said she found out from her own work-up that her
melatonin levels were extremely low, which accounted for why she
had been a poor sleeper.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts on aging, however, are shaking their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Walt Nieri, past president of the Arizona Geriatric Society
and director of the Sun Health-St. Joseph's geriatric fellowship
program, thinks Sperling's clinics are a little off the mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think wellness needs to be an expensive process,''
Nieri said. ``When you put a price tag on it and cater to the rich,
it raises some suspicions.''
</P>
<P>
   Nieri does not doubt Sperling's intentions, and gives him high
marks for funding research. But he thinks Sperling should wait
before offering treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all want to live healthily until we die, and to look
good,'' Nieri said. ``But there are no conclusive clinical studies
proving that any treatments delay the aging processes.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the research has been done on the aging of cells, Nieri
said, and even these reports have yielded conflicting results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans in general have become accustomed to the fact we can
do almost anything _ landing a man on the moon, doing medical
procedures previously undreamed of _ so their expectations are
high,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's just a matter of what you want to believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Sperling said he also expects a little snickering from the
public. At first, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``They also snickered when we started the University of Phoenix
for an adult student body,'' he said. ``Twenty years ahead of the
boom in adult education.'' &QL;

   PHOENIX _ Like most people, Bobbie Clift doesn't enjoy growing
old.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most, she's doing something about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing better than to feel like you're not growing
old,'' said Clift, 39, a Nashville businesswoman.
</P>
<P>
   It's such a good feeling, in fact, that Clift now flies to
Phoenix three times a year and pays thousands annually for
treatments at an anti-aging clinic opened recently by Phoenix-area
millionaire John Sperling.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling, 78, founder of the University of Phoenix, plans to
open nine upscale ``age-management'' clinics in Arizona and
California, and to invest at least a million dollars a year into
aging research.
</P>
<P>
   The first Kronos Clinic _ named for the Greek god of time _
opened in Phoenix; the second is scheduled to open in Scottsdale in
the Phoenix area in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts on aging scoff at such efforts _ similar clinics
have sprung up elsewhere _ saying there is no conclusive evidence
that aging can be retarded. They also question the treatments' high
cost.
</P>
<P>
   But not Clift. She said she'd been frustrated because, despite
aggressive exercise and nutrition, she felt her performance levels
slipping.
</P>
<P>
   After six months of Kronos treatment, she said, her energy level
is back up to her adult prime, ``my lung capacity is now back to
where it was when I was 30,'' and her skin and face have a more
``youthful glow.''
</P>
<P>
   But fighting Father Time doesn't come cheap. Because she takes
human growth hormone injections, Clift's regimen costs $12,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I don't buy a new car this year,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The willingness of Clift and aging baby boomers to spend freely
for extended youth is not lost on Sperling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I wouldn't mind making another billion,'' he said,
adding that the clinics will first be marketed to affluent women,
40 to 65 _ the group that has already made vitamins, herbs,
wellness and workout spas a multibillion-dollar industry.
</P>
<P>
   But Sperling said he also sees the business as an opportunity to
make a contribution to humanity as more than just the wealthy
benefit from the treatments and the research.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling hopes his clinics will help change the way people age
by showing them how to prevent potential health problems. He
believes the idea of using doctors to stay well, instead of waiting
to treat illness, may yet catch on with the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is mass disaffection with traditional medicine now,'' he
said. ``Many doctors are as fed up as the patients.''
</P>
<P>
   But the clinics are only part of the story, he said. Sperling
has also dedicated a minimum of $1 million annually for the Kronos
Foundation to underwrite university-based aging research projects
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   He has conferred with top scientific experts on aging and is
currently sorting through proposals in such diverse areas as
age-related DNA damage, oxidative stress and hormone replacement
therapies. Among his recent visitors was researcher Michael Rose of
the University of California-Irvine, who has earned international
acclaim for DNA work that has doubled the life span of laboratory
fruit flies.
</P>
<P>
   In the clinic, doctors will conduct up to 150 tests on each
patient to help design individualized programs for general health,
appearance and longevity.
</P>
<P>
   After a consultation covering lifestyle and family history,
patients are given tests to examine hormone levels, oxidative
stress and cancer risks.
</P>
<P>
   The cost is $1,200. A complete workup to assess cardiac health
is $1,600. The doctors may prescribe nutritional changes, lifestyle
changes, vitamins, antioxidants and hormones _ programs that
generally can cost from $120 to $800 per month.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic pharmacy will individualize vitamin formulas
according to each person's deficiencies and biochemistry.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling has recruited big names to Kronos. Leading his research
effort will be Dr. Richard Cutler, a pioneer in gerontology.
</P>
<P>
   Cardiologist Dr. Tali Arik, president of the Kronos Group, said,
``Ask most doctors why you are getting old, and they won't have an
answer. But that's not the case with our doctors here.''
</P>
<P>
   Being a pioneer has its price: Arik says some of his peers look
askance at his joining Kronos.
</P>
<P>
   But he and two other doctors who have joined, Dr. Charlotte
DeHaven from Mesa Lutheran and Dr. Cheryl Shafer, formerly of Mayo
Clinic, say they're practicing the best kind of medicine:
prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Does Sperling want to double his own life span?
</P>
<P>
   Well, he'd like to live to 100, if he stays healthy _ which he
tries to do by following an age-management program designed for him
that includes four or five customized vitamin and mineral capsules
per day as well as plenty of exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Shafer said she found out from her own work-up that her
melatonin levels were extremely low, which accounted for why she
had been a poor sleeper.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts on aging, however, are shaking their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Walt Nieri, past president of the Arizona Geriatric Society
and director of the Sun Health-St. Joseph's geriatric fellowship
program, thinks Sperling's clinics are a little off the mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think wellness needs to be an expensive process,''
Nieri said. ``When you put a price tag on it and cater to the rich,
it raises some suspicions.''
</P>
<P>
   Nieri does not doubt Sperling's intentions, and gives him high
marks for funding research. But he thinks Sperling should wait
before offering treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all want to live healthily until we die, and to look
good,'' Nieri said. ``But there are no conclusive clinical studies
proving that any treatments delay the aging processes.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the research has been done on the aging of cells, Nieri
said, and even these reports have yielded conflicting results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans in general have become accustomed to the fact we can
do almost anything _ landing a man on the moon, doing medical
procedures previously undreamed of _ so their expectations are
high,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's just a matter of what you want to believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Sperling said he also expects a little snickering from the
public. At first, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``They also snickered when we started the University of Phoenix
for an adult student body,'' he said. ``Twenty years ahead of the
boom in adult education.'' &QL;

   Here are Anne Stephenson's New &AMP; Notable reviews:
</P>
<P>
   ``GODFORSAKEN SEA'' &QL; 
By Derek Lundy (Algonquin, $22.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The open ocean might look tranquil on any given day, but smart
sailors never forget what Herman Melville called ``the tiger heart
that pants beneath it.'' There have been many adventure-at-sea
books released over the last two years, but we hope you haven't had
your fill because this one is terrific. In Lundy's prologue, he
describes the deep fear that came to him during his first trip
across the open sea in a small sailboat, with just his wife along.
Their goal was to reach the Virgin Islands, but in his heart Lundy
knew that they would make it ``only if the ocean let us through.''
He admits that some of that fear lingers even today when he goes to
sea in a small boat, which makes the subject of his book seem
logical: the Vendee Globe round-the-world race, an astonishing
competition in which participants sail alone for 27,000 miles, more
than half of it through the most dangerous waters in the world (the
Southern Ocean), sometimes taking as long as five months to finish.
Lundy focuses on the 1996-97 race, in which 16 skippers _ 14 men
and two women _ faced severe storms and life-threatening
conditions. One disappeared altogether, and several were rescued
from the freezing water after their boats ran into trouble. The
most dramatic rescue was that of Raphael Dinelli, whose boat
capsized, then righted itself briefly before it went down (a
freezing Dinelli lashed himself to the awash deck, then jumped into
a life raft minutes before the boat sank). His only hope of rescue
from the icy water was Pete Goss, a British competitor who was
caught in the same storm 160 miles downwind. When race authorities
contacted him, Goss immediately abandoned the race and battled for
30 hours through ferocious conditions to reach Dinelli, without
even knowing if he was still alive (yes, but barely). This tale of
heroism, not to mention superb sailing, has a sweet ending: Dinelli
lived, and he and Goss became close friends. If you couldn't get
through Sebastian Junger's ``The Perfect Storm,'' try this one.
It's wonderfully written by someone who knows what it's like to be
alone in a wilderness of wind and waves. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
``ETHEL &AMP; ERNEST'' &QL; 
By Raymond Briggs (Knopf, $21) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   See those people on the cover? You know them. They are Ethel and
Ernest, but you know them by other names. That's what makes this
book so enchanting. It's possible to read it in one sitting,
because it is _ don't panic, please _ a comic strip. Raymond Briggs
is a British illustrator of children's books (``The Snowman,''
``Father Christmas''). He is also the son of Ethel and Ernest
Briggs. Here he imagines his parents' lives from the moment they
first saw each other in 1928 (she was a maid, he was about to
become a milkman) to their deaths nearly 50 years later. Their
conversations over the years reflect world events, from the rise of
Adolph Hitler to the invention of television. They also reflect
things that are not so common today but that we remember in so many
people who are now gone _ modesty, simplicity, an appreciation for
what one has and a stoic acceptance of the troubles life delivers
to one's door. This is Briggs' love letter to his parents. It's not
overly sentimental, just real and wistful and true. Enjoy. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
``THE BOOK ON THE BOOKSHELF'' By Henry Petroski (Knopf, $26) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Petroski (``The Evolution of Useful Things'') is an engineer who
has carved a rather charming literary niche for himself by paying
minute attention to objects that don't seem to deserve it. Pencils.
Paper clips. Zippers. In keeping with that tradition, we read the
title of this book and thought that it might be about the physical
properties of books _ spines, paper, type. We were wrong. It's
about the physical properties of bookshelves. Think about it:
Books. Bookshelves. As subjects go, one suffers by comparison.
Petroski, however, is undeterred. He studies the function and
history of shelves because, he says, ``looking afresh at and
thinking anew about the bookshelf, like looking or thinking from
scratch about anything found or made, brings its own rewards, not
the least of which are fresh new ways of encountering and
experiencing the world.'' We preferred the view from Anne Fadiman's
delightful ``Ex Libris,'' in which the shelves are pretty but the
books get equal time. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
``DIEGO RIVERA'' &QL; 
By Pete Hamill (Abrams, $49.50) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, Pete Hamill traveled by bus from New York to Mexico
City to study art under the GI Bill. He was 21 and, he says, ``in a
daily state of exhilaration.'' He sought out the work of the great
Mexican painters and found in the canvases of Jose Clemente Orozco
and Rufino Tamayo a reason to alter his plans _ within a year, he
had lost his nerve and decided to become a writer, too overwhelmed
by the Mexican artists to paint pictures of his own. But what of
Diego Rivera, the great Mexican muralist? The young Hamill found
him to be ``clenched and stiff . . . hopelessly dated, someone out
of the 1930s.'' Thirty years later, when Hamill visited an exhibit
in Mexico City that celebrated the 100th anniversary of Rivera's
birth, his interest was reborn. For the first time, he says, he
could see what a great painter Rivera had been. This handsome and
engaging book, with photographs and reproductions of Rivera's work,
is both a biography and an analysis of the painter's art and its
effect on an entire country. ``The daughter of an industrialist and
the son of a farmer could look at the work of Diego Rivera and
recognize Mexico,'' says Hamill. ``He is like some great writers,
from Charles Dickens to William Faulkner to Gabriel Garcia Marquez:
the insistence on the value of the local leads to the universal.'' &QL;

`ALLY MCBEAL' FAILS THE TEST OF COMEDY: LAUGHTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   True confession, right up front: I'm one of those people who
doesn't really ``get'' ``Ally McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't misunderstand, I like the show fine. It has much to
recommend it. David E. Kelley's writing is almost always sharp (if
occasionally overly goofy), Calista Flockhart has a good comic
delivery, Greg Germann makes an enjoyable weasel of a boss (even if
he is channeling Michael McKean from the old HBO series ``Dream
On'').
</P>
<P>
   But some viewers love the show. (To their credit, if ratings
mean anything, they're avoiding the truncated ``Ally.'') To them,
it's more than a TV series _ it's a way of life, a sign that
someone understands the world of work and all its weirdness the way
they do.
</P>
<P>
   Those people doubtless cheered when, earlier this year, ``Ally
McBeal'' won the Emmy for best comedy. But that's the thing _ if
it's the best comedy on television, shouldn't it at least make me,
you know, laugh?
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the show provides plenty of humor. But not the kind
that makes you actually laugh out loud. Though vastly different in
theme and execution, ``Ally'' ``McBeal's'' humorous effect is more
along the lines of ``A Prairie Home Companion,'' Garrison Keillor's
radio show _ it's humor for people who don't like to actually laugh
but who like to nod and say, ``Mmm, that's funny,'' with a wry grin
on their face instead.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's ``Ally McBeal'' season premiere follows in that
tradition. Without giving too much away, just know that a quick
tryst for Ally and an anonymous partner leads to all sorts of
head-scratching high jinks, ha, ha.
</P>
<P>
   As for laughter, well, yes, it's humorous when John Cage says,
``Richard says communication is the death knell of any
relationship.'' Yes, it's funny when Fish says, ``You're a gender
bigot, Judge. I'd like you to walk a mile in her diaphragm.''
</P>
<P>
   But does it actually make you laugh? Is ``Ally McBeal'' in fact
the funniest show on television, a qualification that seems
reasonable enough when naming it best comedy?
</P>
<P>
   No. Not even close. In fact, there are few comedies left on
television that can be counted on to dependably cause a viewer to
close his eyes, open his mouth and let loose with a belly laugh.
Not coincidentally, wags are now pronouncing the death of the
sitcom. (Don't worry, it's a semiregular occurrence; when
``Seinfeld'' was hitting it big, the same geniuses pronounced the
death of the hourlong drama. Guess what's booming now?)
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, here's an unscientific look, not meant to be
comprehensive, at a few of the more notable network comedies and
how they rank on the laugh meter: &QL; 
GUFFAW:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Simpsons'' _ Funniest show on television, hands down.
You'd think that after a decade, a traditional family sitcom (even
if it is about a non-traditional, cartoon family) would start to
fade. No chance. As good, or better, than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Action'' _ Every episode offers at least three laugh-out-loud
moments. Too bad no one watches it to enjoy them. &QL; 
HEARTY LAUGHTER:
</P>
<P>
   ``Frasier'' _ It's slipped a bit, but so far, this season shows
signs of rebounding. Gotta love that Niles Crane. Unless you're
Daphne.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friends'' _ Once it got popular, no one called it a
``Seinfeld'' rip-off anymore. Through-the-roof ratings will do that
for a show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' _ As comfortable as a chocolate
milkshake after school at the malt shop. And about as sweet.
</P>
<P>
   ``King of the Hill'' _ When Fox sandwiched this between ``The
Simpsons'' and ``The'' ``X-Files,'' it had the best two-hour block
on television. The network broke it up, naturally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports Night'' _ OK, so it's not technically a comedy. And
``Ally McBeal'' is?
</P>
<P>
   ``Whose Line Is It Anyway'' _ Ditto. &QL; 
CHUCKLE:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Drew Carey Show'' _ Formerly in the above category, it's
slipped noticeably.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ally McBeal'' _ Enough said already.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just Shoot Me'' _ If David Spade and Wendie Malick got more
air time, this would move up a notch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Malcolm &AMP; Eddie'' _ A truly funny guy, Eddie Griffin can't
quite make the transition to sitcom hilarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve Harvey'' _ Ditto. Maybe he and Griffin could team up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Futurama'' _ Proof that Matt Groening isn't infallible.
</P>

CALL HIM FATHER ANTI-TIME: MILLIONAIRE INVESTS IN STRUGGLE AGAINST
AGING 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PHOENIX _ Like most people, Bobbie Clift doesn't enjoy growing
old.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most, she's doing something about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing better than to feel like you're not growing
old,'' said Clift, 39, a Nashville businesswoman.
</P>
<P>
   It's such a good feeling, in fact, that Clift now flies to
Phoenix three times a year and pays thousands annually for
treatments at an anti-aging clinic opened recently by Phoenix-area
millionaire John Sperling.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling, 78, founder of the University of Phoenix, plans to
open nine upscale ``age-management'' clinics in Arizona and
California, and to invest at least a million dollars a year into
aging research.
</P>
<P>
   The first Kronos Clinic _ named for the Greek god of time _
opened in Phoenix; the second is scheduled to open in Scottsdale in
the Phoenix area in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts on aging scoff at such efforts _ similar clinics
have sprung up elsewhere _ saying there is no conclusive evidence
that aging can be retarded. They also question the treatments' high
cost.
</P>
<P>
   But not Clift. She said she'd been frustrated because, despite
aggressive exercise and nutrition, she felt her performance levels
slipping.
</P>
<P>
   After six months of Kronos treatment, she said, her energy level
is back up to her adult prime, ``my lung capacity is now back to
where it was when I was 30,'' and her skin and face have a more
``youthful glow.''
</P>
<P>
   But fighting Father Time doesn't come cheap. Because she takes
human growth hormone injections, Clift's regimen costs $12,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I don't buy a new car this year,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The willingness of Clift and aging baby boomers to spend freely
for extended youth is not lost on Sperling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I wouldn't mind making another billion,'' he said,
adding that the clinics will first be marketed to affluent women,
40 to 65 _ the group that has already made vitamins, herbs,
wellness and workout spas a multibillion-dollar industry.
</P>
<P>
   But Sperling said he also sees the business as an opportunity to
make a contribution to humanity as more than just the wealthy
benefit from the treatments and the research.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling hopes his clinics will help change the way people age
by showing them how to prevent potential health problems. He
believes the idea of using doctors to stay well, instead of waiting
to treat illness, may yet catch on with the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is mass disaffection with traditional medicine now,'' he
said. ``Many doctors are as fed up as the patients.''
</P>
<P>
   But the clinics are only part of the story, he said. Sperling
has also dedicated a minimum of $1 million annually for the Kronos
Foundation to underwrite university-based aging research projects
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   He has conferred with top scientific experts on aging and is
currently sorting through proposals in such diverse areas as
age-related DNA damage, oxidative stress and hormone replacement
therapies. Among his recent visitors was researcher Michael Rose of
the University of California-Irvine, who has earned international
acclaim for DNA work that has doubled the life span of laboratory
fruit flies.
</P>
<P>
   In the clinic, doctors will conduct up to 150 tests on each
patient to help design individualized programs for general health,
appearance and longevity.
</P>
<P>
   After a consultation covering lifestyle and family history,
patients are given tests to examine hormone levels, oxidative
stress and cancer risks.
</P>
<P>
   The cost is $1,200. A complete workup to assess cardiac health
is $1,600. The doctors may prescribe nutritional changes, lifestyle
changes, vitamins, antioxidants and hormones _ programs that
generally can cost from $120 to $800 per month.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic pharmacy will individualize vitamin formulas
according to each person's deficiencies and biochemistry.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling has recruited big names to Kronos. Leading his research
effort will be Dr. Richard Cutler, a pioneer in gerontology.
</P>
<P>
   Cardiologist Dr. Tali Arik, president of the Kronos Group, said,
``Ask most doctors why you are getting old, and they won't have an
answer. But that's not the case with our doctors here.''
</P>
<P>
   Being a pioneer has its price: Arik says some of his peers look
askance at his joining Kronos.
</P>
<P>
   But he and two other doctors who have joined, Dr. Charlotte
DeHaven from Mesa Lutheran and Dr. Cheryl Shafer, formerly of Mayo
Clinic, say they're practicing the best kind of medicine:
prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Does Sperling want to double his own life span?
</P>
<P>
   Well, he'd like to live to 100, if he stays healthy _ which he
tries to do by following an age-management program designed for him
that includes four or five customized vitamin and mineral capsules
per day as well as plenty of exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Shafer said she found out from her own work-up that her
melatonin levels were extremely low, which accounted for why she
had been a poor sleeper.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts on aging, however, are shaking their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Walt Nieri, past president of the Arizona Geriatric Society
and director of the Sun Health-St. Joseph's geriatric fellowship
program, thinks Sperling's clinics are a little off the mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think wellness needs to be an expensive process,''
Nieri said. ``When you put a price tag on it and cater to the rich,
it raises some suspicions.''
</P>
<P>
   Nieri does not doubt Sperling's intentions, and gives him high
marks for funding research. But he thinks Sperling should wait
before offering treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all want to live healthily until we die, and to look
good,'' Nieri said. ``But there are no conclusive clinical studies
proving that any treatments delay the aging processes.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the research has been done on the aging of cells, Nieri
said, and even these reports have yielded conflicting results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans in general have become accustomed to the fact we can
do almost anything _ landing a man on the moon, doing medical
procedures previously undreamed of _ so their expectations are
high,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's just a matter of what you want to believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Sperling said he also expects a little snickering from the
public. At first, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``They also snickered when we started the University of Phoenix
for an adult student body,'' he said. ``Twenty years ahead of the
boom in adult education.'' &QL;

HAWKS ON TOP OF BILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Mike Holmgren admitted that after last week's
disappointing loss to the Chargers in San Diego, he wasn't quite
sure what to expect from the Seahawks Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The team's first-year coach knew what he wanted against the
Buffalo Bills at the Kingdome. He had spent the week preaching
about making a quick start after his team's sluggish effort against
the Chargers.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the message sank in, and materialized in an
impressive 26-16 victory before a sold-out crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Ahman Green returned the opening kickoff 54 yards, which paved
the way to a 7-yard touchdown pass from Jon Kitna to Derrick Mayes
_ the first time this season the Seahawks opened a game with a TD
drive, and only the second first-half touchdown of the season by
the offense.
</P>
<P>
   The defense also responded, holding the Bills to seven plays on
their first two series and ending the next two with interceptions
by free safety Jay Bellamy and strong safety Kerry Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the model of consistency, this team,'' Holmgren said,
half-joking but also right on in his assessment of the Seahawks'
performance Sunday compared to that in last week's 13-10 loss to
the Chargers. ``It sure feels a lot better than it did last week.''
</P>
<P>
   Being back on the winning track and back in first place will do
that. At 4-2, the Seahawks share the AFC West lead with the
Chargers and Kansas City Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks got an assist from the Green Bay Packers, who
slapped a 31-3 loss on the Chargers. That's the same Packers who
host the Seahawks next week in their first Monday Night Football
appearance since 1992, and the same team that Holmgren coached the
past seven seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren was, of course, asked to comment about his return to
the Land of the Cheeseheads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll he happy to do that tomorrow,'' he said. ``Right now, I'm
enjoying this one.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory over the Buffalo was one to be savored, even if the
Bills were playing without Pro Bowl guard Ruben Brown, leading
receiver Eric Moulds, linebacker John Holecek and defensive end
Phil Hansen. Hey, the Seahawks didn't have wide receiver Mike
Pritchard, strong safety Darryl Williams or offensive tackle Todd
Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   Being able to play without some of your best players is a big
part of surviving in the give-and-take world of the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks offense did more taking than giving, and the
defense refused to give in despite taking the best shots Bills
quarterback Doug Flutie had to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren released his conservative stranglehold on the offense
and Kitna responded by completing 17 of 30 passes for 276 yards,
including touchdown throws of 7 and 43 yards to Mayes.
</P>
<P>
   With the Bills looking to take away the outside, Kitna was able
to exploit the middle of the field with passes to Mayes (six
catches for 105 yards), Sean Dawkins (four for 91) and tight end
Christian Fauria (three for 42).
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes back to our play-calling,'' Kitna said. ``When we
start opening things up, and you're not just throwing to one side
of the field or the other, the defense doesn't know where you are
throwing the ball, and that's when guys can go out and make plays
for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Seahawks defenders harassed Flutie all afternoon. They
intercepted two of his passes, and tipped, batted or deflected 13
others. They sacked him twice and hit him on a half-dozen other
occasions. Flutie did pass for 294 yards and two TDs, but had to
put the ball in the air 50 times to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was great was our coaches putting together a reel of
great Flutie plays he made once he scrambled in past games,''
linebacker Chad Brown said. ``Our looking at that reel all week
really helped.''
</P>
<P>
   So did the relentless efforts of the defensive linemen, who
refused to stop chasing Flutie even when their efforts seemed
futile; and the defensive backs, who found themselves in the
uncomfortable situation of wanting to break toward the line to help
contain Flutie but knew they had to plaster their receivers
regardless of how long it took.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Michael Sinclair on the line play: ``Flutie is
slippery. He was able to make some plays, but for the most part I
thought we did pretty good job of disrupting their offense. If it
had been a different quarterback, I think I would have had a lot of
sacks. Flutie did a great job of getting away from us.''
</P>
<P>
   Twice, Sinclair had Flutie in his grasp. Twice, Flutie spun
free. But Sinclair finally got his sack, and it came at a very
opportune time. After Flutie had moved the Bills to the Seattle 36
and was looking like he was about to trim the Seahawks' 26-16 lead
with 5{ minutes to play, Sinclair not only sacked him but forced a
fumble that was recovered by Sam Adams.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Willie Williams for the defensive backs: ``It takes a
lot of focus with him running around back there. Usually, you cover
your man for a count of, `One-thousand-one, one-thousand-two,
one-thousand-three, one-thousand-four.' With this guy, you're
going, `One-thousand-five, one-thousand-six, and even
one-thousand-seven,' and wondering what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   The special teams contributed Green's tone-setting return of the
opening kickoff, four field goals from Todd Peterson and a couple
of energizing hits on kickoff coverage from Robert Wilson and Brian
Walker.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the match that started the fire,'' Green said of his
return. ``That was the thing that got things blowing up in the
first half.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Seahawks back on the winning track.

YANKEES GRAB GAME 2 AFTER PARADE OF STARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The loudest cheers at Turner Field came before Game 2
of the World Series Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Rose was there. So were Ted Williams, Willie Mays and local
icon Hank Aaron. The home of the Braves was awash in baseball glory
when the sport recognized the greatest players in its history.
</P>
<P>
   Then one of history's greatest teams went to work. And the fun
for the home fans was over.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees had five hits in the first inning Sunday
night. Atlanta has four hits in its first 17 innings this series.
It was David Cone's turn to dominate, and he pitched the Yankees to
a 7-2 victory and a 2-0 series lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was remarkable,'' Cone said of the pre-game scene. ``And it
worked out well for me. The fans were so into the ceremony that
nobody got on me in the bullpen. It was a great distraction (and) I
warmed up without being noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon enough, Cone would be hard to ignore. He fired four hitless
innings before Greg Myers singled to lead off the fifth, and
pitched seven one-hit innings overall.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Hernandez pitched seven one-hit innings to win Game 1.
The Yankees' starters, inconsistent at times this year, have been
stingy so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're only as good as your pitching,'' said shortstop Derek
Jeter, who had two hits to extend his postseason hitting streak to
15 games. ``They've got some great hitters on that team, and for
the most part our pitchers have shut them down.''
</P>
<P>
   The last team to win the first two World Series games on the
road was Atlanta, against the Yankees in 1996. But the Braves lost
the next four games and the series, and are now in danger of
dropping their fourth World Series in five trips this decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play every game like it's our last game,'' said Cone. ``I
know that sounds like a cliche, but this team really does go for
the jugular.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees haven't dropped a Series game since Game 2 in 1996.
They swept San Diego last year and now have won 10 in a row in the
Fall Classic, a streak surpassed only by their ancestors, who won
12 straight from 1927-32 behind Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig.
</P>
<P>
   After being held to just two hits in Game 1 Saturday, the Braves
made several lineup changes. Bobby Cox inserted left-handed hitters
Ozzie Guillen, Keith Lockhart and Myers, replacing regulars Walt
Weiss, Bret Boone and Eddie Perez.
</P>
<P>
   But after the cold weather held down a deep drive by Brian
Jordan to end the first inning, the lineup was largely helpless in
what may have been Cone's last outing as a Yankee. The 36-year-old
right-hander, a free agent this winter, is not sure he'll be
brought back next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's on my mind, probably more than it should be,'' Cone
said. `` ... The best times of my life have been pitching for the
Yankees. (But) They've got some difficult decisions to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone won only twice in 13 starts after his July perfect game,
and the Yankees, who gave him only a one-year deal after his 20-win
season in '98, may have concerns about his durability. Top prospect
Ed Yarnall is a possible replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the Yankees _ yes, the Yankees _ have financial
concerns. They don't want to raise their $86 million payroll, yet
Derek Jeter, Mariano Rivera and Andy Pettitte are due for
arbitration and Roger Clemens can demand a trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more important than a rotation _ I have trouble
visualizing a clubhouse without David Cone,'' said Yankees manager
Joe Torre. ``He means so much to this ballclub.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially in October. Cone, who beat the Boston Red Sox in Game
2 of the American League Championship Series, improved to 6-1 in
the postseason as a Yankee. He was even more dominant than he was
in his last Series start against Atlanta, when he worked six
one-run innings to win Game 3 in '96.
</P>
<P>
   Braves starter Kevin Millwood was in Class A then, and he's
since become one of baseball's best young pitchers. He started this
postseason with a complete game one-hitter in the Division Series.
But his outings have gotten shorter and shorter since.
</P>
<P>
   After lasting into the eighth and sixth innings in his
second-round starts, Millwood was lifted before getting an out in
the third Sunday night. The two-inning performance was the Braves'
shortest start in their 27 World Series games this decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had good stuff,'' Millwood said. ``I just threw it over the
middle of the plate. I tried to make adjustments, but nothing
worked for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Run-scoring singles by Paul O'Neill, Tino Martinez and Scott
Brosius gave the Yankees a 3-0 lead in the first. Millwood worked a
scoreless second, but struggled in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball wisdom says it's better to remove a pitcher one batter
early than one batter late, and that was proven again. Millwood
allowed singles to Bernie Williams and Martinez leading off the
third, and stayed in to face the left-handed Ricky Ledee. Ledee,
hitless in Game 1 after going 6-for-10 in the '98 Series, smashed a
double to left-center, scoring Williams and bringing in left-hander
Terry Mulholland from the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees increased their lead to 5-0 off Mulholland when
Guillen, the shortstop, tried a Mays-style basket-catch on a soft
pop by Cone, dropping it for an error.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do anything bad,'' Guillen said. ``I didn't kill
anybody. I just made an error. I've made mistakes before.''
</P>
<P>
   So have the rest of the Braves at this time of year.

FLUTIE CHASE GREAT DRAMA FOR NFL SUNDAY MATINEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ All day long, they were laughing at Michael Sinclair.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks' sack master spent much of Sunday afternoon chasing
wildly around the Buffalo Bills backfield.
</P>
<P>
   All he had to show for it was a fistful of air.
</P>
<P>
   The guys on the Seahawks sideline shook their heads and chided
their Pro Bowl teammates, whose stats were lagging and whose ego
was taking a few lumps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys were saying to me, `Looks like you just don't want a
sack today,''' Sinclair said after the Hawks had secured their
26-16 victory but had come to understand what it's like chasing Mr.
Flutie.
</P>
<P>
   OK, there were a few white threads off Doug Flutie's jersey
under Sinclair's fingernails.
</P>
<P>
   Once, Sinclair did get ahold of Flutie. It was a brief, slippery
moment in which everyone in the Kingdome seemed to watch like it
was the high-drama of their favorite, delicious cartoon show.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie was Jerry out-foxing Tom. The Road Runner eluding Wile E.
Coyote. In this show, the little guy is the one you root for.
</P>
<P>
   Even for Seahawks fans, even for Sinclair fans, you can't be a
fan of the game if you don't root for the little guy to keep
breaking free, to keep making plays, against all odds.
</P>
<P>
   It almost seemed unfair when, early on in the game, Sam Adams
rocketed off the line and nailed a vulnerable, back-dropping
Flutie. But the Hawks defenders were willing to show no mercy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get a piece of him. I wanted to put that in his
head that we were coming for him,'' Adams said. ``You have to make
that point, a quarterback that good. The ability to make plays like
that _ that's a gift.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Hawks did not get as much of Flutie as they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   So many times Sunday, Sinclair pursued. So many times, just like
Merlin, the magical Flutie juked and shimmied and ripped himself
out of Sinclair's grasp _ until Sinclair had had enough.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth quarter. The Hawks' comfortable 23-3 halftime
lead had dwindled to 26-16, mostly because this one guy wearing No.
7 for the Bills refused to go down, no matter how many passes
Flutie's teammates dropped or how many yards his rushers could not
get him.
</P>
<P>
   But with just over five minutes left in the game, it sure seemed
there was still plenty of time for Flutie to pull off another
charmed chapter in his now storybook career.
</P>
<P>
   But finally, with Flutie already having heaved 42 pass attempts
in his valiant and nearly one-man comeback effort, Sinclair could
smell it was time.
</P>
<P>
   So on first-and-10 on the Hawks 36-yard line, Sinclair twitched
and jittered on the line, waiting for Flutie to call for the snap
deep in his shotgun position.
</P>
<P>
   And when Flutie did make the call, Sinclair turned the corner,
coming on like a bull who finally captures the red cape in his
angry stare. Finally, Sinclair took firm hold of the elusive beast
named Flutie, hauling the pint-sized giant killer to the turf.
</P>
<P>
   The ball flopped free and Flutie lay sprawled while Sinclair's
teammate Sam Adams pounced his 300-pound body on top of the
football, wrapping it and the game up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can tackle him in a phone booth,'' Sinclair
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The refs should check his uniform. He must have had super suds
on his jersey or something.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk around the NFL since Flutie overcame his
ridiculous exile to the Canadian Football League and began turning
heads again by beating up teams in a league where he had all but
been rejected, there is still a feeling Flutie can't be quite that
good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when you watch film of Buffalo, you watch Flutie and
you think it must be those other teams that can't catch him. But
when he comes to my place, it's going to be another story,''
Sinclair said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he did a great job of getting away from us. If it had been
a different quarterback today, I think we would have had a lot of
sacks. Flutie did a great job of getting away from us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks could walk away feeling happy about their work
Sunday. They pushed their record to 4-2 and gained a three-way tie
for first place in the AFC West with the Chargers and Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was impossible not to relish what Flutie was doing out
there, scrambling, making lives amusingly hellish after the Hawks'
watched a 20-0 lead dwindle.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie had only 83 yards on 7-for-16 passing in the entire first
half, including two interceptions. But before he was done, he had
collected 294 yards on 24-for-50 accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put pressure on him to make a lot of plays. He made some
that nobody else would have made, I know that,'' Bills coach Wade
Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't enough to set off fireworks or challenge any of John
Elway's comeback records, but Flutie was captivating to watch. His
energy seemed almost unmatched _ at least until Sinclair finally
got his hands on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were right there. I never felt we were out of it
up until the fumble,'' Flutie said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   He still looked pumped. He still exuded a feeling that, given
another set of downs, he could go out and make the score closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked around at each other after the game and said it was
a fun game,'' Sinclair said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like playground ball. Chasing little kids around.
That's what it felt like.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's real slippery, very athletic and he makes a lot of plays.
So many times being in the NFL, you look for the typical guy who
looks good on paper. The 6-foot-4 guy, 230 pounds,'' Sinclair said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But here's a guy who's a playmaker. He isn't big. He isn't
tall. But man, the guy's a playmaker. We got after him pretty good
today. It was fun.''
</P>
<P>
   We have come to relish nothing less in these NFL Sundays of
chasing Mr. Flutie.

PARTY OF PERON LOSES ITS HOLD ON ARGENTINA
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating throughout)   (sw)

<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ Mayor Fernando de la Rua of Buenos
Aires, a somber centrist who campaigned pledging to clean up
government graft and breathe oxygen into a sluggish economy,
appeared to win a landslide victory in presidential elections on
Sunday, ending a decade of rule under the flamboyant and
unpredictable Carlos Saul Menem.
</P>
<P>
   De la Rua's victory, which he claimed in a triumphant appearance
at a downtown hotel, was widely expected, but significant for
breaking the domination of the populist party founded by Juan
Domingo Peron, for decades the most prominent politician in
Argentina and a man whose shadow has hung over its politics years
beyond his death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compatriots, I thank you,'' de la Rua said, swamped by
cheering supporters. ``I come to thank you as your president-elect.
This is a triumph for all of you. All Argentina won.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Menem, the Justicialist Party veered off its traditional
populist course and toward free-market policies, creating a potent
coalition between the working class and an emerging upper middle
class.
</P>
<P>
   But the last year of deepening recession and a wide variety of
government scandals soured many Argentines toward Menem's rule,
busting the new coalition and leading to de la Rua's easy victory.
He appeared to coast through the campaign, refusing to debate his
leading opponent, Eduardo Duhalde, the Buenos Aires governor, or to
divulge many details of his policies.
</P>
<P>
   With 65.9 percent of the official results counted, de la Rua,
the candidate of the center-left Alianza coalition, was winning
48.8 percent of the vote. Coming in a distant second was Duhalde,
the 58-year-old candidate of Menem's party, who was winning 37.5
percent and conceded defeat on Sunday night. Domingo Cavallo, a
former economy minister running on a conservative third-party
ticket, was winning 10.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a clear mandate,'' de la Rua declared. ``We need to
develop a social system that includes everyone with equality of
opportunity for all. We will end corruption and impunity.'' And in
an implicit swipe at Menem, who became known for his fast cars and
socializing with entertainers and sports stars, he added that his
government ``would leave egotism behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes after polls closed, all major Argentine networks
declared de la Rua the winner, and his supporters poured into the
streets dancing across Buenos Aires's main thoroughfare, the
Avenida 9 de Julio. De la Rua, an author of several law books and a
lover of gardening and golf, promised during the campaign to slice
an expanding budget deficit that he said would lower interest rates
and attract foreign investment. He pledged to grant incentives to
small and medium-sized businesses as a way to decrease the 14.5
percent unemployment rate, as well as narrow the gap between rich
and poor that has grown as the Menem administration has sold off
government agencies and enacted a slew of deregulatory measures.
</P>
<P>
   And he said he would crack down on tax evasion and government
corruption, suggesting that at least some top officials in the
Menem administration could go to jail.
</P>
<P>
   De la Rua, however, repeatedly promised during the campaign not
to touch the cornerstone of Menem's economic policy _ pegging the
value of the Argentine peso one-to-one to the dollar, which ended a
long history of hyperinflation and economic instability.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole country has high expectations,'' said de la Rua, 62,
wearing his usual blue blazer and ascot to his polling place in the
upper-class Buenos Aires neighborhood of Barrio Norte. In his
signature deadpan style, he added, ``I guess my life is going to
change a little tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   After voting, de la Rua talked amiably with reporters about the
recent baptism of a new grandson and predicted an orderly
transition. But he also made a special appeal to Menem to avoid any
costly last-minute pork-barrel projects leading up to the
inauguration on Dec. 10.
</P>
<P>
   As mayor of Buenos Aires, de la Rua was not known for any major
initiatives. But he put the city budget in the black, lengthened
the subway system, widened public health services and improved
services for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Duhalde blocked Menem's attempts to contest a constitutional ban
against running for a third consecutive term, but he never managed
to unite and fire up his party. He veered between distancing
himself from Menem and embracing the successes of the last decade,
especially the end of hyperinflation.
</P>
<P>
   The election appears to mark the first time that the party of
Peron will lose power by popular mandate and not by military coup _
breaking an almost uninterrupted string of election victories that
gave it a domineering position in Argentina politics over the last
two generations.
</P>
<P>
   Its devastating defeat could have repercussions for years to
come, with what remains the country's largest political force going
through a probable power struggle to decide whether it returns to
its traditional left-wing direction or merely fine-tunes Menem's
free-market policies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, many analysts predict that de la Rua will not be a
forceful President. He will govern by leading an alliance of the
centrist Radical Party and the more liberal Frepaso Party, a group
that broke away from Menem's party in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The two parties, joined in the Alianza, appear to have picked up
a few seats in the lower house of Congress, but they will not have
a working majority. Menem's Justicialists will continue to control
the Senate through at least the 2001 elections, and to dominate the
Supreme Court and most of the provincial governments _ despite
losing the gubernatorial seats in Mendoza and Entre Rios on Sunday.
A handful of governorships and part of the lower house of Congress
were contested in Sunday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a government that will have to negotiate, a big
break from the way Menem was able to govern,'' said Mariano
Grondona, a columnist for the Buenos Aires daily La Nacion. ``It's
the end of the era of the caudillo,'' he added, referring to the
Spanish term for the traditional strongman.

GREEN'S KICKOFF RETURN JUMP-STARTS SEAHAWKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HOLLY CAIN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ For someone who has been integrated into the Seattle
Seahawks offense so slowly, Ahman Green sure got off to a fast
start Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Green returned the opening kickoff 54 yards _ just shy of his
career best 57-yard effort _ and later turned in a pair of long
runs from scrimmage to set up two first half Seattle scores in the
Seahawks' 26-16 victory over Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you get a kickoff return like that to start a game,
it certainly helps when you're playing at home,'' Seahawks
quarterback Jon Kitna said.
</P>
<P>
   Green's return provided the team exactly the kind of jumpstart
Seattle coach Mike Holmgren has been asking for in recent weeks.
But Green's three carries for 29 yards _ his first rushing attempts
of the year _ may prove equally as significant. With Green in the
backfield the team gets a speed and slash style running option to
complement primary running back Ricky Watters' power and endurance.
</P>
<P>
   Green and Watters combined for 110 yards, Seattle's most
productive rushing output of the season _ besting a 94-yard,
all-Watters effort against Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very encouraged with what he (Green) did today, even
though he didn't carry the ball a lot,'' Holmgren said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the season goes along, Ricky Watters is going to carry the
ball most of the time, but it is a nice change-up with Ahman and I
hope now we can do that a little bit more.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are promising words from Holmgren, who has been deliberate
and calculating in including the second-year pro Green in his
play-calling. While Green was gaining confidence returning
kickoffs, Holmgren began slowly increasing his rushing duties
during practice, especially in the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Far from getting impatient with Holmgren's pace, Green said he
understood his coach's time line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy with what I got today,'' Green said. ``It's
something to build my confidence on. It's even more of a plus to me
because I got to go in and contribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that was bothering me (in past weeks) was
making sure I was learning the playbook. I'm a perfectionist and
once I got into the mix today I felt good.''
</P>
<P>
   It appeared Green's play invigorated the entire Seahawks offense
and certainly the kickoff return set a positive tone. Then on
Seattle's final first-half possession, Green reeled off a 16-yard
run off right tackle, then answered with a 13-yard carry behind
left tackle on the next play. The drive resulted in a Todd Peterson
field goal for a 23-3 lead at half.
</P>
<P>
   Green didn't carry the ball again, but Watters, who insists he
never needs extra motivation, doubled his first-half output in the
second to finish with 75 yards on 22 carries. His 19-yard run in
the third quarter was his longest of the year and comes during what
Watters called a ``real difficult week.'' He was excused from two
practices to attend to family-related matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always ready to go,'' Watters said. ``I had a hard week
but I wanted to show I could handle it and come in and have a great
game. I felt like (my mind) was clear today and I was ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our running game is no going like it should, I take it
personally even if it's not me. It seems like every week we get a
little better and a little better. ... We were clicking. We felt
good.''

BUMBLING BILLS SEEK ANSWERS AFTER DEBACLE IN DOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALIYA SAPERSTEIN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Buffalo made so many mistakes in its 26-16 loss to the
Seahawks Sunday, the Bills' players were unable to put their
fingers on exactly what caused all the problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the million dollar question,'' said rookie cornerback
Antoine Winfield, shaking his head in dismay. ``I'm going to have
to watch the film to be sure. All I know is we couldn't get
anything done.''
</P>
<P>
   A clipped Wade Phillips, who seemed ready to explode at any
moment during his postgame questioning, was willing to take a stab
at the answer, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a terrible first half. Just horrible,'' said the
Buffalo coach. ``That cost us the ballgame _ we couldn't make the
plays to get all the way back.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips continued to castigate his team, singling out the
Bills' defense _ which came into the game ranked sixth in the NFL,
but was missing two starters in Phil Hansen and John Holecek _ for
particular criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had horrible pass defense,'' Phillips said. ``I have no
answer for it. ... The secondary was terrible. Coverage was
terrible. We made some plays that were unbelievably poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips was most dismayed at having to watch Derrick Mayes
score on a 43-yard pass over the middle after having called for
double coverage on the Seahawks' wide receiver. Winfield and safety
Manny Martin were the Bills who got burned as the Seahawks took a
20-0 lead midway through the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't doing anything (special). They were just like any
other receivers we played,'' said Winfield of the Seahawks. ``We
were playing a lot of zone coverage and they were just hitting on
the deep routes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't execute. We had good coverages called,'' he
added. ``We just didn't make the plays we needed to make.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Seahawks racked up 385 yards, 241 yards of which came
in the first half and 105 of which were by Mayes alone, Buffalo's
offense struggled almost as much as its defense.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of Pro Bowl guard Ruben Brown, running back Thurman
Thomas and Pro Bowl wide receiver Eric Moulds helped cripple the
Bills, who had half a dozen dropped passes, and 15 more knocked
away by the Seahawks. That left quarterback Doug Flutie with a 24
of 50 performance for 294 yards and two interceptions. Flutie also
was sacked four times, two of which came on third down and forced
punts.
</P>
<P>
   Both Brown and Moulds were injured in the loss to Oakland last
week, while Thomas has beenout with a bruised kidney and liver
since the first play of Buffalo's first game this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seem to have an injury bug right now,'' said Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills may have more important things to recover from after
the beating at the Kingdome. Phillips keyed on solving Buffalo's
habit of getting behind early in games as perhaps the only way the
Bills will be able to move on from their second straight loss to
two more road games at Baltimore and Washington. Sunday, the Bills
were down 23-0 before they managed to score.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are getting down in every game and it's hard to come
back,'' Phillips said. ``I think it is probably coaching, and I'm
taking me first. We have to get them more prepared at the first of
the game. ... I realized we've turned it over and (our opponents)
have had it in our territory on the first drive the last three
games. Every time they have scored a touchdown. We have to remedy
that.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if one remedy might be switching quarterbacks,
Phillips said tersely, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Flutie _ despite keeping his team within striking distance until
Seahawks defensive end Michael Sinclair sacked him, causing a
fumble with five minutes remaining _ was willing to shoulder some
of the blame for the debacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all took our turns making mistakes,'' said the oft-doubted
quarterback. ``After we got down, a fire started burning and I kept
saying, `We have to get back into the game.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It starts with me, I guess. I have to get the ball in better
places and get guys fired up to play.''

YANKEES TAKE CONTROL AS CONE SILENCES BRAVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Major League Baseball honored the All-Century Team at
Turner Field last night, a ceremony that had infinitely more drama
than the game that followed.
</P>
<P>
   The All-Century revelry also gave Atlanta Braves fans something
cheer about with the heralded appearances of local idol Hank Aaron
and national martyr Pete Rose. The thundering ovations accorded
both served as a stark contrast to the shock and disbelief to
follow.
</P>
<P>
   The Battle of the Decade is turning into a lopsided affair.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees, piling on further proof they're as good as
any team in any decade, pounded All-Star pitcher Kevin Millwood for
five runs in two-plus innings and took a two-game advantage in the
World Series with a 7-2 victory over the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   David Cone, sitting on a 3-0 lead before he threw his first
pitch, was as good as Orlando Hernandez in Game 1, shutting out the
Braves on one hit through seven innings before calling it a night.
The Braves salvaged a couple runs off reliever Ramiro Mendoza in
the ninth inning to avoid the shutout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitching sets the tone for what we're trying to do, and David
Cone was terrific for us tonight,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt really strong tonight,'' said Cone, starting for the
first time in 10 days and only the third time in a month. ``The
extra rest has really helped me; it's put life back in my arm. I
was a little wild; that's what extra rest will do for you, but I
was able to work out of some jams.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, after losing two on their home field, now must win
at least two of three in the unfriendly confines of Yankee Stadium
to get this series back to Turner Field. They seek a reversal of
what happened in 1996 when the Braves won the first two games of
Series at Yankee Stadium, only to have the Yankees win the next
four.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question, we're aware of what happened back in
'96,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   It still doesn't look good for the Braves, not against this
relentless team. The Yankees have won nine of 10 in this postseason
and 20 out of 23 going back to last year's playoffs. The Yankees
have also won 10 consecutive World Series games dating to the
comeback against the Braves and the sweep of the San Diego Padres
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Only 11 of 45 teams have come back from a 2-0 deficit to win the
World Series. Only three teams have done it after losing the first
two games at home: the 1985 Kansas City Royals, the 1986 New York
Mets and the 1996 Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just don't expect to do that this time of year, not
against great teams,'' Cone said. ``But that's a tribute to our
starting pitching. We've had some really great games pitched.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, looking almost as bad as the Rangers against Yankees
pitching, have been outscored 11-3 and out-hit 20-7. By the seventh
inning, Braves fans had replaced the Tomahawk chop with the
desperate chant, ``We want a hit!''
</P>
<P>
   ``We played a bad game,'' Atlanta manager Bobby Cox said. ``We
didn't hit the ball \RSaturday night\S, and we didn't hit it
tonight. We really weren't tearing the ball up against the Mets.
Both pitchers were tough, we figured it would be tight but we
haven't had the pitching to keep it tight.''
</P>
<P>
   After his team had only two hits in Game 1, Cox tried to inject
more offense in his lineup by using left-handed hitters Ozzie
Guillen at shortstop, Keith Lockhart at second base and Greg Myers
behind the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Myers had two of the Braves' five hits and had a run-scoring
single. But Guillen let in an unearned run in the third when he
dropped Cone's soft line drive for an error, and Lockhart cost the
Braves another run when he threw wildly trying to complete an
inning-ending double play in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   However, the game had pretty much been decided before then. The
Yankees probably had it won in the first when Chuck Knoblauch,
Derek Jeter and Paul O'Neill started the game with consecutive
singles, giving them a 1-0 lead. Millwood got Bernie Williams to
hit into a double play, but a single by Tino Martinez, a walk to
Ricky Ledee and single by Scott Brosius made it 3-0. nn

BEATING CARDINAL KEY TO HUSKIES' PAC-10 TITLE HOPES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TED MILLER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Skeptics have kicked Stanford around most of the
season. Now the Cardinal is kicking back.
</P>
<P>
   After Stanford overcame a three-touchdown deficit to dust
nemesis USC 35-31 on Saturday, the Cardinal and its 5-0 Pac-10
record can't be doubted any longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they've been enjoying (the doubts),'' University of
Washington coach Rick Neuheisel said Sunday. ``There's no question
they are a legitimate team.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford hasn't been 5-0 in conference play since 1970, the last
time it played in the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel and the Huskies can only hope that Stanford's
legitimacy won't be enough to end a 14-game losing streak at Husky
Stadium, where the two teams square off Saturday at 12:30 p.m. The
game has been picked up by ABC-TV.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford's last win at Husky Stadium? A 24-21 decision in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford, which suffered verbal slings and arrows from the media
because of a 52-point loss to Texas and a defeat to lightly
regarded San Jose State, is the conference's only unbeaten team.
The UW and Arizona State, the Cardinal's next opponent on Nov. 13,
are tied for second with 3-1 marks. ASU hosts Oregon on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to win this week if we want a shot at the conference
championship,'' Neuheisel said. ``It's a big-time game and big-time
games are what Husky fans expect.''
</P>
<P>
   The showdown figures to be a scoring slugfest. Stanford's
offense averages nearly 37 points per game. Meanwhile, its defense
was ranked 110th in the nation before it gave up 587 yards to the
Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford, which surrenders nearly 33 points per game, owns the
conference's worst pass defense. USC threw for 415 yards against
the Cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   But that defense was stout enough to stop USC when it counted.
Tim Smith intercepted a pass as time ran out with USC on the
Cardinal's 7-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic nature of the victory over USC inspired even
reticent Cardinal coach Tyrone Willingham to break character _ if
only for an instant.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment, it's awfully big,'' Willingham said. ``Right
now, we're living in the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford is far better defending the run. It gave up just 125
yards on the ground per game before yielding 172 to the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   The question is which Huskies offense will show up. Two weeks
ago, the UW was a power-running, option attack that topped the
conference in time of possession. The past two weeks, the Huskies
haven't run as well and have lost the time of possession battle.
</P>
<P>
   If the UW has to throw, it will do so without its best receiver,
Chris Juergens, who is doubtful after spraining his ankle in the
Huskies' 31-27 victory over California. He adds his name to a long
list of banged up UW players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're held together by glue and string,'' Neuheisel quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford is much healthier than the Huskies, though its
second-leading receiver, DeRonnie Pitts, sprained his ankle against
USC and is questionable for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   That should put pressure on flanker Troy Walter, the
conference's leading receiver. Walter, who is already the Pac-10
career receiving yards leader, caught five passes Saturday, which
gives him 218 for his career, six short of the conference record.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal, typically one of the conference's best passing
teams, also is balanced this season. It has rushed for 1,140 yards
after producing just 831 yards on the ground all of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford could practically ensure a tie for the conference title
with a victory. After the UW, the Cardinal has just two conference
games left on its schedule (ASU and Cal).
</P>
<P>
   Washington also has the conference champtionship as its goal,
which will be on the line Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I've said before: The Rose Bowl is always your goal,''
Neuheisel said. ``But the only way to get there is to win this
week.''

COWBOYS, SANDERS SILENCE TRASH-TALKING REDSKINS

<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING _ The Cowboys propelled themselves back into the NFC East
driver's seat by completing a season sweep of the Washington
Redskins, 38-20, at Texas Stadium yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   In one fell swoop, the Cowboys overcame the Eagles game, the
Giants game, wholesale public skepticism, nine penalties, six
dropped balls and a week's worth of doubt and criticism heaped upon
the Chan Gailey offense.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the Chan Gailey offense fired back yesterday. It converted
nine of 15 third-down situations, rolled up 352 total net yards,
put up points on its first three possessions for the first time all
season and scored twice as many touchdowns in one game as it had in
its previous two games combined.
</P>
<P>
   But most of all yesterday, the Chan Gailey offense overcame
itself.
</P>
<P>
   And in the process, the Cowboys, in effect, took a one-game lead
on the Redskins in the standings, based on the NFL tiebreaker
system in which head-to-head competition is the first criterion.
The Cowboys and Redskins are 4-2, followed by the New York Giants
at 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   While Deion Sanders' 70-yard punt return for a touchdown in the
fourth quarter iced the game, nothing yesterday at Texas Stadium
was bigger than a 13-play, 93-yard touchdown drive by the Cowboys
that began late in the third quarter, with the Cowboys precariously
clutching a 24-20 lead.
</P>
<P>
   This drive turned out to be a microcosm of the Cowboys' season,
or at least the turn the season had taken in the wake of 13-10 road
losses at Philadelphia and New York the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   On the drive, the Cowboys had to overcome two penalties and
three dropped passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something we haven't been able to do lately,'' said
Gailey. ``But we got some opportune penalties \Ron the drive\S.
Plus, I thought one of the big differences in this game was
third-down'' conversions.
</P>
<P>
   Tight end David LaFleur alone had a false start and two of the
three drops on the drive. Wide receiver Alvin Harper had the other
drop; running back Chris Warren had a holding penalty.
</P>
<P>
   But the big play was pass interference called against Washington
nickel back Darryl Pounds, who was covering Harper on third-and-20
from the Cowboys' 9. It gave the Cowboys an automatic first down at
the Dallas 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chan called an outstanding game today ... I think we threw 'em
off on the route that Alvin ran, and we got the pass
interference,'' said Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman, who completed
20 of 32 passes for 244 yards and two touchdowns, with no
interceptions and no sacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The \Rpass interference\S was a big because it came on
third-and-long ... \Rand\S you don't make those very often in this
league.''
</P>
<P>
   Three plays after Harper was obviously fouled into the turf,
Cowboys first-year wide receiver Jason Tucker fought off
bump-and-run coverage on third-and-seven and streaked down the
Washington sideline, past celebrated rookie cornerback Champ Bailey
on what turned out to be a free play (The Redskins were offside.).
Tucker took Aikman's perfect toss in full stride for a 52-yard gain
to the Redskins 19. Aikman finished the drive with a 1-yard
touchdown run.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, playing with a first-quarter concussion that kept him
out of the game until he took it upon himself to return early in
the third quarter, put this game on ice with a 70-yard punt return
for a touchdown with 9:03 left. The Redskins still haven't touched
him.
</P>
<P>
   Washington brought the NFL's No. 1 offense and No. 31 defense
into this game.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys held the Redskins to 15 fewer points and 232 fewer
total net yards than they did in the Cowboys' 41-35 overtime
victory in the Sept. 12 season opener.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, the Cowboys have scored 79 points and rolled up 893
yards in two victories over Washington this season. In these two
games, they've scored 11 offensive touchdowns. In their other four
games combined, they've scored seven touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we had \Rthe Redskins\S on their heels for most of
the game,'' said Aikman, referring to Gailey's play-calling that
allowed a passing attack that involved nine receivers and a running
game in which Emmitt Smith finished with 80 yards on 24 carries.
</P>
<P>
   Redskins coach Norv Turner can be excused for thinking that the
Chan Gailey offense undergoes some kind of metamorphosis against
his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``They certainly are a lot more wide-open on offense against
us,'' said Turner, in a classic understatement.
</P>
<P>
   Turner also pointed a deserved finger at his own players for the
bulletin-board material provided mostly by Redskins receivers
Albert Connell and Michael Westbrook, who directed their taunts and
threats during the week at Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told our team repeatedly during the week, `We're coming to
Dallas. We've been here before,' '' Turner said, ``and anyone who
thought this game was going to be any different than it was ...
wasn't listening.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman was amused by the trash talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just amazed any time that kind of talk is done in this
league,'' Aikman said. ``I don't understand it. It's not boxing.
We're not having a hard time selling tickets. I think a lot of guys
want to bring attention to themselves and get some publicity, and
have the whole world recognize them ... I don't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Redskins got it.
</P>
<P>
   Both barrels. nn

SUDDENLY, A LIGHT GOES ON FOR GAILEY'S BEDEVILED OFFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ That fine line between idiot and genius swung
back the positive way for Chan Gailey yesterday. But stay tuned _
it's an on-going weekly judgment call by fans, media and maybe even
some of his quick-to-privately-backstab players.
</P>
<P>
   Four offensive touchdowns and 31 total points against the
Redskins not only returned the Cowboys to the win column, it also
upgraded Gailey's football IQ.
</P>
<P>
   On this afternoon, he wasn't dumber than a bumper hitch. The
light was on, and somebody was actually home. But even after a
38-20 victory, how bright will that bulb burn after upcoming trips
to the land of Colts and Vikings? With the Packers, Miami and the
Patriots also on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   This team chopped down a few trees yesterday, but is not out of
the woods. For Gailey, however, it was at least a brief reprieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I'd liked to be judged is by where we are as a team
and an offense when the season is finally over,'' Gailey said,
requesting the impossible in this part of the football world.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when you go through what we've gone through the last
couple of weeks,'' he added, ``it does bring up immediate
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When does it turn? When does a sense of urgency consume our
team? Will it be today, or will it take another week or two? But
what I'd hoped would happen, happened today.''
</P>
<P>
   Meaning a total team victory with the previously deadhead
offense so productive it took the pressure off a Cowboys defense
known to bend and break.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Gailey had read all the sports-page rips aimed his way. As
a non-listener, he did miss the talk-show roast. But offense is
Gailey's baby. And the baby was sick. It had been stuck on 10
points for two consecutive losses. The head coach was having his
head handed to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My reaction to the criticism was I wished everybody wasn't
saying all that stuff about me,'' Gailey said. ``But on the other
hand, if we'd played better, they wouldn't have said the stuff to
begin with.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, always an honest sort, swears he didn't take it
personally. ``If you do, then it impacts the way you think,'' he
replied. ``I'm not going to allow that to happen. In general, I
didn't agree with why we were being criticized. But I understand.
It's a part of the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Why did success happen yesterday? Was there a change in
offensive philosophy, leading to this touchdown breakout? Did
Gailey simply call better plays? Is Washington's defense not up to
snuff with that of Philly and the Giants? Or did Nelson Mandela, a
Texas Stadium visitor, offer Gailey a few offensive tips?
</P>
<P>
   ``The man does know how to handle pressure,'' grinned Gailey,
very impressed when he spotted Mandela in the postgame locker room.
</P>
<P>
   But while Gailey tweaked the offense, there were no major
changes. A few frills were eliminated, mainly Emmitt Smith running
more between the tackles instead of outside.
</P>
<P>
   More important, however, this victory and this offensive
turn-around was more about the line being dominant instead of being
dominated. It was about a very sharp Troy Aikman being on-target to
a makeshift group of receivers, who still had a way-too-many
half-dozen drops.
</P>
<P>
   And for what it's worth, nobody in the Cowboys' locker room put
the Redskins' defense in the same class as the last two they've
faced. Washington did show stacked fronts at times, but mainly
stayed in a basic 4-3, without an abundance of blitzes. The Giants
had disrupted the Cowboys six days earlier with constant eight- and
nine-man run blitz packages.
</P>
<P>
   Jumping to a 17-0 lead also gave both the Cowboys' offense and
defense (buried by the Redskins' 35-points-a-game offense in the
season opener) a sudden sense of superiority. ``Enough can't be
said about the quick start we had, and what that meant to us
mentally,'' center Mark Stepnoski said.
</P>
<P>
   As the Redskins constantly closed in (it was 17-13 and 24-20 in
the second half), the offense responded with a touchdown answer.
And they did so with Emmitt and receiver Rocket Ismail missing a
portion of the second half due to injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, Gailey had a good play-calling game. Anything that works,
then that's good. A lot worked this time. Like the same end-around
to Rocket that backfired so badly in New York, gained 19
second-quarter yards as the key play in a touchdown drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't get carried away with any pats on the back this week,
the same as I couldn't let the negative stuff brother me last
week,'' Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   If possible, it'd be best to keep those priorities in order as a
hard stretch of schedule continues.

ATLANTA'S LINEUP CHANGES DON'T WORK IN THE FIELD OR AT THE PLATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The thinking behind Braves Manager Bobby Cox's
decision to shake up his lineup was that perhaps inserting the
left-handed hitters Ozzie Guillen, hitting .250 in the post-season,
and Keith Lockhart, hitting .286, would kick-start a moribund
offense _ that had managed just one hit off the Game 1 starter
Orlando Hernandez _ against the right-hander David Cone, the Game 2
starter.
</P>
<P>
   But Cox could never have imagined that the two _ who between
them had made seven errors this season _ would inflict so much
damage in the field that there was no way they could make up for it
at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   As the Braves' offensive woes continue _ they have a total of
seven hits in the first two games of the World Series _ Cox is left
to revert to Plan A for Game 3: he will go back to his regular
lineup to face the left-hander Andy Pettitte. The one-day
experiment failed in the Yankees' 7-2 victory on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Guillen was starting for the 46th time this season at shortstop
and that meant Walt Weiss, who started Game 1 and every game of the
championship series, would be on the bench. Lockhart, who was
making his 19th start at second base in replacing Bret Boone, is a
34-year-old who did not establish himself in the majors until he
was 30 and who is now used mainly as a pinch-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Their personalities are as different as can be _ Guillen brash
and talkative, Lockhart reserved and soft-spoken. But both made
critical mistakes that contributed to the Yankees' rout that sends
the World Series to Yankee Stadium with the Braves down by two
games to none. Their abysmal play created a gaping hole in the
middle of the infield, and the Yankees stepped through it for two
runs.
</P>
<P>
   Guillen, a major leaguer for 15 seasons, had made seven errors
playing shortstop this season and this was his first World Series
start. His error in the third inning was particularly painful to
watch, a routine catch turned to Little League farce. With the
Braves already trailing by 4-0 and two on and two out, David Cone
hit a 1-2 jammed liner to Guillen. The ball appeared to slice just
a bit as it neared him.
</P>
<P>
   Guillen lowered his glove to make an underhand catch, but _
whether the ball hit the tip of the glove or made no contact at
all, or if Guillen was blocked by Ricky Ledee going to third _ he
dropped it and Tino Martinez scored to extend the lead to 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball took a funny sink,'' Guillen said. ``I've missed
balls before. I will miss more balls. Why be embarrassed? I didn't
do anything bad. I didn't kill anyone. I didn't beat my wife. I
made a mistake and they scored. I played good. I made one
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   When Cone popped out to Guillen in the fifth, the Braves fans
offered a mocking cheer for Guillen, which Guillen good-naturedly
accepted. ``They pay,'' he said, ``to do what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, Guillen, who was batting second in the
order as part of Cox's plan to try to eke out a few more hits than
the Braves did against the Yankees in Game1, grounded into an
inning-ending double play in the bottom half of the third inning.
He went 0 for 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had a good at-bat yet,'' Guillen said. ``We only
have one hit or two hits in a game. You're not going to win with
one hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart was only slightly better. He made no errors when he
started at second base this season. And he was not charged with an
error in the fourth, but his mistake led to another Yankee run
anyway. With Derek Jeter on third and Bernie Williams on first,
Martinez grounded to Guillen. He dropped to a knee to toss the ball
to Lockhart for the force on Williams at second base.
</P>
<P>
   But Lockhart had been expecting a simple underhand flip from
Guillen and he was caught off-guard when Guillen flung it at him.
As Lockhart turned to finish what seemed a sure double play, the
ball caught in his glove and Lockhart could not get a grip on it.
He finally removed it, but then threw the ball out of Ryan Klesko's
reach at first base. As the ball rolled to the screen in front of
the Braves' dugout, Jeter scored to put the Yankees ahead, 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you why this is happening,'' Lockhart said
quietly, trying to explain why the normally fundamentally sound
Braves unraveled so rapidly. Lockhart did walk twice and scored one
of the runs in the ninth inning, but by then, in the near quiet of
a cleared out park, the Braves were already trying to figure out
why they had fallen into such a terrible funk.
</P>
<P>
   The doubt will linger into the off-day workout Monday, when the
Braves will take batting practice at Yankee Stadium, scrambling to
coax some hits before the series slips away without even one Braves
rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to work with some guys and see what's going on,''
Cox said. ``We're just honestly trying to score some runs right
now.'' &QL;

CHARGERS BLITZED BY PACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Welcome to the AFC West, the NFL's version of the
Pacific-10 Conference, where the only distinction is the size of
the paycheck and better parking privileges.
</P>
<P>
   On a warm day at Qualcomm before 68,274, many of whom came for
the cheese, the San Diego Chargers, leaders of the AFC West, threw
six interceptions and posted a rousing three points in a 31-3 loss
to the Green Bay Packers.
</P>
<P>
   They did this despite having possession of the ball for 34 of
the game's 60 minutes, including 22 of the first 30. To say this
was a waste of time would be a waste of time if not for the
relevance to the rest of the AFC West and the Chargers' tradition
of offensive ineptness.
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers remain atop the weakest division of Paul
Tagliabue's conglomerate with a 4-2 mark, tied with Kansas City and
Seattle and a half-length ahead of Oakland. They share this heady
space even though they've scored just one offensive touchdown or
less in their last three games.
</P>
<P>
   That stat is just one small part of a larger trend. In their
last 28 games dating back to the end of the 1997 season, the
Charger offense has been held to a touchdown or less 21 times. No
one from Duracell or Energizer is rushing to build an ad campaign
around this team.
</P>
<P>
   But then everyone in the AFC West shares a frailty, like the
Chiefs trying to win without a running game and the Raiders testing
fate game after game. The Charger quarterbacks are journeymen Erik
Kramer and Jim Harbaugh, but then so is everyone else in the AFC
West -- Elvis Grbac, Rich Gannon, Jon Kitna. Brian Griese is a
sophomore backed up by Bubby Brister.
</P>
<P>
   It is to the Chargers credit that there is no myopia in the
locker room, no delusions of adequacy. They realize they're blessed
to be in the west, where there are no quarterbacks like Brett Favre
and no team capable of running away from the pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in first place,'' said Junior Seau, the former
Trojan and Chargers' defensive leader. ``We lost to a team that's
better, and we realize that. I'm happy to be where we are. I don't
think anyone expected us to be (4-2).
</P>
<P>
   ``We put this offensive scheme together this summer, with a new
coach and two new quarterbacks. It's going to take a awhile to
jell. Right now, it doesn't look good. But it can get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Seau couldn't say that a year ago, when by now the Ryan Leaf era
had already fallen to earth like a scud and the team was in
tatters.
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers are trying to win games with quarterbacks who have
sub-.500 career NFL resumes, Erik Kramer and Jim Harbaugh, but then
so are a dozen or so other teams. Those teams not blessed with a
Favre are either playing veterans with checkered pasts or rushing
youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer threw four interceptions a week ago, but Chargers coach
Mike Riley decided to stick with the former Lion because the team
won, 13-10 over Seattle. Kramer threw three interceptions Sunday
and also gagged on a play at the end of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Down 14-3 with six seconds left and no timeouts, he didn't throw
the ball away when pressured and was sacked. ``I tried to make
something out of nothing,'' he said. ``That was a poor decision
brought on by the previous interceptions. I wanted to get us back
in the game. I'm choking on my pride.''
</P>
<P>
   Charger fans had chanted for Harbaugh to replace Kramer before
that play. But head coach Mike Riley, the ex-USC aide who gave up
the security of the Oregon State job to coach in the NFL, waited
until it was 28-3 and the fourth quarter before switching to the
one-time Bear and Colt quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably waited too long,'' said Riley. ``But Jim hadn't
played for awhile and I thought we had a chance (with Erik).'' It
probably wouldn't have made a difference. When Harbaugh did come
in, his first pass was picked, and he had two more intercepted
before the game ended.
</P>
<P>
   The counterpoint to the Chargers trying to win Sunday with
relics from the NFC Central was Favre seizing every opportunity for
the Packers. This Green Bay team bears little resemblance to the
Packers team that played for Super Bowls a few years ago. These
Packers do not run the ball or defend like those teams.
</P>
<P>
   But Favre is enough. He completed 12 of 22 for 173 yards and
three touchdowns, slicing up the Chargers by running a fast-paced
offense and throwing the ball very quickly. In stark counterpoint
to the Chargers' inability to score more than a touchdown a game,
Favre has now thrown for two TDs or more in 57 of his last 80
games.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's start was his 115th in a row, and he will tie Ron
Jaworski's NFL record of 116 straight next week. The two active
quarterbacks with the longest streaks behind him aren't exactly
comparable -- Trent Dilfer (70) and Kordell Stewart (38).
</P>
<P>
   Favre was coming off his worst game as a pro last week in
Denver, but no one would know it by his play Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very impressed with his quick release,'' said Riley.
``He gets rid of the ball very quickly and he has great composure.
We did some good things against him defensively, but he is so good
and difficult to stop, especially when you give him extra
opportunities.''

<P>
   ``You're always anxious to play,'' said Favre. ``If you play
long enough, you're going to have a game when you can't do anything
right like last week, and games when you play great. You just keep
moving forward.''
</P>
<P>
   That's good advice for the Chargers. If it can work for
Stanford, why not the former Oregon State coach?

YANKEES ARE ROLLING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They haven't instituted the scorched earth policy that
Sherman did a few years back when his troops made an unwelcome
appearance in this historic southern hamlet, but the Yankees
continue to cause misery in these parts.
</P>
<P>
   These New York Yankees, of course, are slightly more peaceful
than the aggregation that Sherman commanded, preferring to do their
damage with their bats, arms and gloves in a non-violent approach
that has left the Atlanta Braves violently ailing.
</P>
<P>
   And that's precisely what the Yankees did Sunday evening in an
overwhelming fashion, impaling the Braves, 7-2, in a boring affair
that wasn't faintly as close as the final score suggests.
</P>
<P>
   This World Series won't be officially over until the Yankees win
four games, a total they figure to reach in the middle of the week
at Yankee Stadium if they continue to function at such a divine
level and their opponent continues to stumble and bumble haplessly.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in just two games, the Yankees have turned what was
expected to be a tight series into such an uneven competition that
the most riveting bit of drama in Game 2 came before the first
pitch was thrown and didn't even involve any of the participants.
</P>
<P>
   They should have replayed that heated nationally televised
debate between Team of the Century outfielder Pete Rose and NBC
sideline interviewer Jim Gray on the Turner Field scoreboard
because, apparently, it caused a greater reaction from viewers
around the country than did the one-sided game that was decided the
moment the reeling Braves manager, Bobby Cox, made out his lineup.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, watching Jim Gray, a mediocre Howard Cosell copycat of
limited talent, inciting Rose with hardball questions turned out to
be far grander theatre than watching Derek Jeter, Chuck Knoblauch,
Tino Martinez, Bernie Williams, Paul O'Neill, Ricky Ledee pound out
one base hit after another and David Cone retire one Brave batter
after another on the clear, 49-degree evening.
</P>
<P>
   It's just getting uglier and uglier for the Braves, who were
one-hitted across seven innings by the Cuban exile, Orlando (El
Duque) Hernandez, on Saturday night and, proving that wasn't a
fluke, came right back to be one-hitted across seven innings by
Cone.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the Braves have been consistent.
</P>
<P>
   This was a total Braves collapse, from their batters failing to
hit to their fielders failing to field to their manager reverting
to classic World Series form.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just played a bad game,'' said Bobby Cox.
</P>
<P>
   Cox also managed a bad one.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Cox might be Manager of the Year in the National League
this season and he might have done his best work in his career, but
the guy has a lengthy history of falling apart in these World
Series game dating back to 1991 when he cost his team a probably
triumph against the Minnesota Twins because of a curious loyalty to
a home-run-prone left-hander named Charlie Leibrandt.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't enough space to list all of Cox's miscalculations
during the Braves' World Series failures this decade against the
Twins, Toronto Blue Jays and Yankees, but we can add a few more to
Cox's ledger in light of the weird lineup he drew up for the second
game.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of going with the same group of doughty fellows that
overcame a serious challenge from the New York Mets, Cox decided to
go with three new starters against the Yankees for no more
compelling reason than they happen to bat from the left side of the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine, except Ozzie Guillen, who replaced the reliable
Walt Weiss at shortstop, is old and can't field any longer; Keith
Lockhart, who replaced the sure-fielding Bret Boone at second base,
makes the erratic Chuck Knoblauch look like Robbie Alomar in the
field; and Greg Myers, who replaced NCLS Most Valuable Player Eddie
Perez at catcher, isn't exactly a renowned handler of pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   All three men endured problems Sunday night, as Guillen dropped
a infield popup I could have caught, Lockhart threw a ball halfway
to Savannah, and Myers failed to coax anything meaningful out of
the Braves' starter, Kevin Millwood, who gave up eight hits and
four earned runs in just two innings.
</P>
<P>
   One idly wonders why Cox even started Millwood, a 24-year-old
right-hander who won 18 games during the regular season but doesn't
have the post-season credentials of a John Smoltz.
</P>
<P>
   Why is Cox waiting until Game 4 to pitch Smoltz, who is one of
the prime big-game pitchers in baseball?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he figures the Braves might be in an 0-3 precipice by
then, and will need Smoltz to keep his team afloat.
</P>
<P>
   I can't figure it out, but I've spent the entire 1990s trying to
figure out many of Cox's October moves.
</P>
<P>
   The loudest cheers of the night came before the game when Pete
Rose was introduced during the Team of the Century ceremony and in
the fifth inning when Guillen caught a popup off the bat of Cone
after dropping one from Cone in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not our night,'' Bobby Cox kept saying.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't look like the Braves' series, but they can take
solace in the fact that it was only three years ago that they
opened with two easy wins over the Yankees in New York _ 12-1 and
4-0 _ only for the Yankees to come back to win the next four in a
World Series streak that now has reached 10.
</P>
<P>
   But these Yankees aren't those 1996 Braves.
</P>
<P>
   These Yankees play the game the way it is supposed to be played,
and they just keep throwing pitchers out there that the Braves
simply can't solve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hitters are pressing. . .no doubt about it,'' said the
Atlanta hitting coach, Don Baylor. ``We've been trying to rally,
make something happen. And nothing is happening.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitching sets the entire tone of our team,'' said the Yankee
manager, Joe Torre. ``It just has been so good, and it's a lot
easier for us to play from ahead than from behind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not out of it,'' said Ozzie Guillen in the solemn
Atlanta dressing room. ``We've had to overcome so many things this
year, and I think we can overcome this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have about as much chance of overcoming these lordly
Yankees as Jim Gray does of being invited to Pete Rose's next
gambling bash.

KINGS HANG ON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Kings scored. They fought. But
most of all Sunday night, they remembered how lousy it felt to get
embarrassed. They vowed there would not be a repeat of Friday
night's Phoenix meltdown against San Jose and proved it with a 4-3
victory over the league's hottest team.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings withstood a penalty shot and a late goal by the Sharks
that had the crowd of 15,270 at the Staples Center getting nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we came together for this game and we were not going to
lose it,'' said Luc Robitaille, who scored the 525th goal of his
career to pass Bryan Trottier for 21st all-time. ``We just knew
with all the hard work we had done since Phoenix that that wasn't
going to happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Patrick Marleau made it a one-goal game with 2:36 to
play, Robitaille thought the biggest difference came in the final
minute of the second period when Kings goalie Stephane Fiset
stopped a penalty shot from Mike Ricci, a former teammate in Quebec
and Colorado. Fiset had been accused of throwing his stick at
Ricci's shot near the net.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings (5-3-2) were leading 4-2 at the time. Against Phoenix,
they had a 3-1 lead and a power-play opportunity when the Coyotes
scored a short-handed goal and turned the game around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I faced him in practice for six years,'' said Fiset, who has
stopped five of eight penalty shots in his career. ``He never tried
to deke me, so of course he would try tonight. It was big for the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   But several players said it was not as big as leaving Fiset in
goal after allowing three cheap goals against Phoenix. Coach Andy
Murray also had benched the first two lines for the final six
minutes of that game but played them Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big confidence boost for us,'' said Fiset, who will
get a rest Tuesday against Washington after playing all but one
period of the first 10 games. ``It showed that he believes in this
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of the Kings losses had come after blowing leads, so
clearly they wanted to get on top Sunday and stay there.
</P>
<P>
   They took the lead just four minutes into the game on Bryan
Smolinski's second goal of the season, a blast from the point with
Andy Sutton off for elbowing. Just over five minutes into the
second period, seldom-used left-winger Dan Bylsma got his first of
the year after taking a pass from behind the net by Rob Blake.
</P>
<P>
   For Bylsma, who has played so little he was sent to minor-league
Long Beach for a game two weeks ago, it was his first goal since
the 1997-98 season. But he already had made an impression in this
game, flattening Gary Suter on a check at center ice midway through
the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille then joined in, making it 3-0 with 10:49 remaining in
the second period. It was his eighth of the season but just his
first in five games.
</P>
<P>
   But after going 0-2-1 in their past three games, the Kings had
to maintain the pressure. Ricci cut it to 3-1 with a power-play
goal midway through the second, but the Kings came back with a goal
by Donald Audette, who stripped the puck from 19-year-old rookie
Brad Stuart and sailed it over the left shoulder of a sprawling
Sharks goalie Mike Vernon.

TAYLOR: SUCCESS IS ABILITY TO BOUNCE BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles Kings general manger Dave Taylor
suffered along with the coaching staff after Friday night's 6-3
loss to Phoenix, but he also remembered why he hired them.
</P>
<P>
   In coach Andy Murray, he saw an skilled communicator who hadn't
been a head coach at the NHL level but had built a reputation in
handling players at the international level.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor knew that would be needed after Friday's game, when so
many Kings played poorly. Murray went to the whip after the game
but worked Saturday to rebuild the players' confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``You aren't going to play well every night,'' Taylor said.
``There are 82 games. But you don't want a bad night turning into
bad habits.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was pleased when the Kings dominated play in the first
period Sunday and opened the second by killing off an Ian
Laperriere penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, those are signs the guys can come back from a bad
game,'' Taylor said. ``They didn't have much jump against Phoenix,
but they showed some grit against San Jose.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said one of the things he liked most about Murray _ who
was an assistant at Philadelphia, Winnipeg and Minnesota _ was his
philosophy on the power play. Murray liked to feed the big shot at
the point and keep his power-play unit intact.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a league-leading 31.4 percent success rating
(11 goals in 35 attempts). The Kings' first goal Sunday, by Bryan
Smolinski, came on the power play, as did their third, by Luc
Robitaille, midway through the second period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andy keeps things simple and, with Rob Blake at the point, we
have the big shot,'' Taylor said. ``He wants his lines together. I
think guys play better the more they know each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Fight on: One of Murray's biggest points during Saturday's
workout was staying aggressive for an entire game. The Kings were
outshot 17-7 in the third period Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, defenseman Sean O'Donnell was whistled for two fighting
penalties. At one point midway in the second period, the Kings had
four players in the penalty box. O'Donnell was in for fighting,
Steve McKenna (roughing), Aki Berg (tripping) and Donald Audette
(tripping).
</P>
<P>
   Since one team cannot have more than a two-man advantage on the
ice, the Sharks played 5-3 and quickly scored on a goal by captain
Owen Nolan.

A GROGGY SANDERS, DEFENSIVE GEM GET THE ROYAL TREATMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ So there we all were in the postgame locker room
...
</P>
<P>
   The Reverend Do-Rag, Deion Sanders, clad only in his white bath
towel; me, in my J.C. Penney sportcoat; Owner Jones, grinning as if
he'd just eaten another canary; Prince Bandar of Saudi Arabia, the
franchise good-luck charm; Nelson Mandela, former president of
South Africa and the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize winner, and a gathering
assortment of media riff-raff and sweaty jockstraps.
</P>
<P>
   When you win, you see, life is good. Everybody, even Nobel Prize
winners, wants to hang around with you.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys won big yesterday, humbling the Washington Redskins,
38-20, in a game that smacked of redemption. Life was good.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was absolutely lovely,'' Mandela said, as he worked the
room behind a small vanguard of security men. ``I thoroughly
enjoyed it.''
</P>
<P>
   As fate would have it, the day featured only two awkward
moments. The first came when Sanders was smacked head-on silly by
Redskins special teamer Dan Turk, a blow that sent Prime Time
wobbling to the locker room. The second uncomfortable scene came
when somebody handed Mandela a tacky Cowboys ballcap to wear, which
he politely did.
</P>
<P>
   When you win, alas, you can get away with anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember half the game, but the offense played
great,'' announced Sanders, who claimed to still be woozy an hour
after the game ended.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Deion was only half-right. On this day, the Cowboys'
offense purred like a Lincoln, but the defense performed even
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you get your butt beat, you want to come back and play
well,'' defensive coordinator Dave Campo explained.
</P>
<P>
   In the season opener at Washington, Campo's bunch had
surrendered 504 yards, including 382 through the air by quarterback
Brad Johnson. Their game-day successes since then had been laced
with asterisks left by lesser quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel, though, like our defense has been improving
from week to week,'' Campo contended.
</P>
<P>
   Back-to-back losses had not helped Campo's case. But he's right.
Since the track meet at Washington, the Cowboys' defense has
replaced cornerbacks Kevin Mathis and Charlie Williams with
veterans Sanders and Kevin Smith, who were both injured. In
addition, Alonzo Spellman, Darren Hambrick and Randall Godfrey are
no longer newcomers at their positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a very young defensive football team,'' Campo said. ``A
lot of people don't realize that.''
</P>
<P>
   But yesterday, it didn't matter. The Cowboys held the Redskins
to 272 yards and forced them to struggle on third down. For the
home team, life was good.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the things that we talked about all week,''
linebacker Godfrey said. ``They were, I think, the No. 2 team in
the league in third-down conversions, and we knew we had to keep
their offense off the field.''
</P>
<P>
   To stop the Redskins on third down, Campo and his staff
emphasized stopping Johnson and the Norv Turner offense on first
down. Washington came into the game leading the NFL in average
yards gained on first down.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were converting about 40 percent on third down,'' Campo
went on. ``But we saw that a lot of those situations were
third-and-1, third-and-2 or that range. If we could get them into a
third-and-longer situation, we could have a chance to use some of
our coverage stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis worked. Toss out the Redskins' one long-gainer of
the day on first down, a 21-yard third-quarter pass, and the
Cowboys' defense held Washington to only a 2.6-yard average on
first down. The average third-down situation for the Redskins ended
up being third-and-7.
</P>
<P>
   The ``coverage stuff'' kept Johnson, for the most part, from
launching the bomb. Even when Sanders wobbled off the field, the
defense held together.
</P>
<P>
   His collision had cast an eerie silence over an already mute
crowd of 64,377. Back in the locker room, as the first half played
on, Sanders was approached by owner Jerry Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you remember me?'' Jones asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, you're the guy who signs my checks,'' the Reverend
Do-Rag answered, apparently snapping to his senses.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders returned in the third quarter, and whatever bolts had
been loosened in his absence were swiftly tightened.
</P>
<P>
   In Jones' box, former President Mandela, Prince Bandar and
Jerry, the king of the Cowboys, looked on, obviously delighted.
</P>
<P>
   It was a grand day for the home team. It was a good day to host
royal guests.
</P>
<P>
   It was a great day for the defense to redeem itself.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys were back in first place. No prizes _ yet. nn

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Nobody uttered the words, but many of the Yankees were
thinking the same thing as they hauled their bats and gloves to the
clubhouse Sunday night after their 7-2 mauling of Atlanta in Game 2
of the World Series: remember 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Remember how the Atlanta Braves won the first two games of the
World Series on the road that year, the way the Yankees have this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Remember how dominant the Braves were in those games, as the
Yankees were here.
</P>
<P>
   Remember how the Yankees came back to win the final four games
of that World Series _ and, Joe Girardi and Jim Leyritz were
thinking, do not let it happen this year.
</P>
<P>
   David Cone allowed one hit in seven innings on Sunday night, as
Orlando Hernandez did in Game 1, and the Yankees have a
stranglehold on this World Series. They have won 10 straight games
in World Series play, 9 of 11 in this post-season. Atlanta totaled
seven hits in the first two games.
</P>
<P>
   They also have Tom Glavine pitching Game 3 on Tuesday night in
Yankee Stadium, and then John Smoltz in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what we're up against,'' Girardi said. ``They're very
capable, and we know that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Braves also are in deep, deep trouble; they tried a new
lineup on Sunday night and there wasn't any indication it would
make any difference against the Yankees' experienced starting
rotation. ``We didn't hit the ball last night,'' said Bobby Cox,
the Atlanta manager. ``We really didn't hit the ball tonight until
the ninth. We're just honestly trying to score some runs right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox went to Plan B for Game 2. Don Baylor, the Braves' hitting
coach, approached Keith Lockhart after Atlanta's defeat in Game 1
on Saturday and suggested that Lockhart stay ready because he might
play in Game 2. What Lockhart did not know was that Cox had been
planning major lineup changes.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez had embarrassed the Braves' right-handed hitters with
his slider _ in particular second baseman Bret Boone, catcher Eddie
Perez and left fielder Gerald Williams. Knowing that Cone has a
similar approach to that of Hernandez, who throws his slider from
different angles to confound right-handed hitters, Cox stacked his
lineup with left-handed hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart started at second in place of Boone, who had 144 starts
during the regular season, Ozzie Guillen was the shortstop instead
of Walt Weiss and Greg Myers opened at catcher rather than Perez.
``We're just throwing it out there,'' Cox said, ``and seeing if
they won't change things.''
</P>
<P>
   There was some risk to Cox's strategy: Guillen and Lockhart are
inferior to Weiss and Boone on defense. But Cox could have assumed,
with much justification, that the shortcomings of his substitute
middle infielders would not have manifested themselves. Kevin
Millwood is a fly ball pitcher of the first order, who averaged
0.88 ground balls for every fly ball this season.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Ledee, the Yankees' left fielder, studied videotape of
Millwood on Sunday afternoon, like a student cramming for a final
exam. What he saw was Millwood whipping his fastball at 93 to 95
miles an hour, overpowering hitters before dropping in his sharp
curveball or a slider.
</P>
<P>
   The Kevin Millwood who pitched on Sunday night was nothing like
the pitcher Ledee studied. His fastball in the first inning was 90
to 91 mph, his slider was inconsistent, he did not really use his
curveball. During the season, opponents hit just .102 against
Millwood with two-strike counts, but on Sunday night, he had no
weapons with which to finish off the Yankees' batters.
</P>
<P>
   And the Yankees were in a rare state of mind, some of them
furious after witnessing the tense interview Jim Gray of NBC
conducted with Pete Rose directly in front of their dugout before
the first inning. Paul O'Neill moved to shake Rose's hand after the
interview, and after the game, he and other Yankees were in a rage.
``You're talking about a man's life, his reputation,'' O'Neill
said.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if some of them focused that anger on the Braves.
Chuck Knoblauch, the first batter of the game, fell behind, no
balls and two strikes, and Millwood leaned back and pumped a high
fastball, a Neanderthal approach that might have been effective if
he had better stuff.
</P>
<P>
   But Knoblauch slammed a single into left-center field, and this
would be Millwood's pattern in the first inning. After Derek Jeter
pulled a single into left field _ the Yankees had first and second
and nobody out _ O'Neill fell behind, no balls and two strikes, and
fouled off three two-strike pitches before he hit a single to
center field, scoring Knoblauch.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams grounded into a double play, Jeter taking third,
and it appeared Millwood might get out of the inning allowing just
the one run. But Tino Martinez fell behind, one ball and two
strikes, and then smashed a line single to left, driving in Jeter.
Ledee drew a walk, and like those before him, Scott Brosius fell
behind no balls and two strikes, before grounding a ball toward the
middle, to the left of Guillen.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss, the Braves' regular shortstop, might or might not have
reached the ball; Guillen did not, and Martinez scored as the slow
roller reached center field. The Braves had one hit in all of Game
1, they were facing a tough pitcher with a revamped lineup, and
they were behind by three runs before their first at-bat. Millwood
required 38 pitches to get through the first inning, and more
telling was the fact that of those, the Yankees' swung and missed
just one time.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood slogged through the second inning, throwing another 18
pitches. But Williams led off the third inning by falling behind in
the count, 1-2, then bouncing a ball to Lockhart's right, and past
him _ a ball Boone would have reached easily. Martinez singled and
Ledee crushed a double between the outfielders in left and center,
Williams racing home with the Yankees' fourth run. Terry Mulholland
relieved Millwood. ``I stunk,'' Millwood said later. ``I thought I
had pretty good stuff, I just couldn't get where I wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   With two outs, Cone was next, his hitter's senses dulled by
years of playing in the American League. But he waged a surprising
battle with Mulholland, fouling off five pitches; the Yankees would
foul off 24 pitches in the first three innings.
</P>
<P>
   Then Cone reached out and poked a ball with the end of his bat,
the pain of imperfect contact slicing through his hands as his
little pop fly spun at Guillen. The Braves' backup shortstop took a
couple of steps to his right, held out his glove for an easy chance
_ and he dropped the ball. Martinez went across home plate; Yankees
5, Braves 0, and Cox put both hands on the top of his head in
frustration, in a Homer Simpson pose. Guillen and the Braves were
booed heavily as they ran off the field at the end of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   There were more follies. Jeter doubled to lead off the fourth
and took third on a fly ball. After the Braves intentionally walked
Williams, the Atlanta infield played back, looking for a double
play.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, Martinez grounded to Guillen, who flipped to
Lockhart, who bobbled the ball for a moment before stepping on
second and, in fear of losing the double play, fired the ball high
and wide of first baseman Ryan Klesko.
</P>
<P>
   More boos. The Yankees now were in command, 6-0, and half their
runs were a direct result of the play of the Braves' middle
infield.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been getting any hits, any runs,'' Lockhart said.
``Bobby tried to do something different. It didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans would begin quietly fleeing Turner Field and the cold
shortly thereafter, not hanging around to see the outcome of the
only remaining drama of the evening: could the Braves get a hit off
of Cone?
</P>
<P>
   Eligible for free agency after this season, Cone was pitching
perhaps his final game for the Yankees, and he stymied the Atlanta
left-handers with his split-fingered fastball. He was so very
careful, avoiding the middle of the plate even with the big lead.
He threw 35 pitches in the first three innings and only two were on
the inside half of the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Cone pitched to the conditions. An outside slider to
Brian Jordan hung in the bottom of the first inning and the Braves'
cleanup hitter crushed a high drive to left field, certainly a home
run on most days. But the wind was gusting from left to right and
Jordan's fly fell about five feet short.
</P>
<P>
   Cone walked three batters in the first four innings, but Atlanta
had no hits. When Myers skipped a single through the middle to
start the fourth, the fans roared sarcastically, out of patience,
and maybe out of hope in the last World Series of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Cone was replaced after seven innings, after striking out four
and allowing no runs. The Braves had three hits in the ninth inning
to improve their World Series average to .121, but the effect was
just cosmetic.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees command the match-up now; they are in control. And
they remember 1996, vividly; it's all very clear, without words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say anything to my team,'' said Joe Torre,
the Yankees' manager. ``This game of baseball is very tough.'' &QL;

ROSE IS STILL ROSE, HUSTLING THE SPORT HE LOVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On the day of what could well be his last chance for
absolution from Major League Baseball, Pete Rose skipped an
early-afternoon news conference introducing the All-Century Team to
spend the morning at an Atlantic City casino.
</P>
<P>
   Not gambling, mind you. He was there signing photos and baseball
cards of himself at a card show.
</P>
<P>
   For a fee, naturally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie'' was hustling again.
</P>
<P>
   It's what he has been doing _ seemingly nonstop, if you've
caught his act on the Home Shopping Network _ for the past 10
years, since baseball handed him a lifetime suspension for gambling
on the game he loves so much while managing the Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, as a prelude to Game 2 of the 1999 World Series,
Major League Baseball sold out to a popular credit-card company and
allowed Rose to bring his shell game back to the baseball diamond.
</P>
<P>
   A sold-out Turner Field greeted Rose's introduction with the
loudest and most-sustained ovation of the melodramatic event,
louder and longer than those for Babe Ruth, or wheelchair-bound Ted
Williams, or even favorite son Hank Aaron.
</P>
<P>
   Rose cannot find his name on a Hall of Fame ballot, but he
remains solidly entrenched in the hearts of the common man, who
still fondly remembers ``Charle Hustle'' and his irrepressible zest
for the game.
</P>
<P>
   The music built to a crescendo, the fans roared, Jane Fonda
wiped tears from her cheeks and Rose's eyes moistened as he was
introduced with the other great outfielders of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   As heart-tugging as it seemed, it was not a shining moment for
baseball, which allowed itself to be used in a promotional gimmick
and broke its own rules in the process.
</P>
<P>
   As a suspended player, Rose is technically not allowed to
associate with anyone in baseball without that person also placing
himself at risk of suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Bud Selig, your own case is now before you.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we decided to do this All-Century Team, we brought
together lists of the top 100 players taken from three different
sources,'' said Rich Levin, spokesman for the commissioner's
office. ``Pete Rose was on all three lists. So was Shoeless Joe
Jackson \Rsuspended for his participation in the Chicago Black Sox
scandal in 1919\S.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no thought of leaving either player off because of
their suspended status, Levin said.
</P>
<P>
   And so Rose came back to the ballpark last night, sanctioned by
the sport which won't officially acknowledge he even exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew he'd get a huge ovation,'' Levin said, shrugging.
</P>
<P>
   Rose arrived for his own pregame news conference flanked by his
nodding attorney on one side and his 15-year-old son, Tyler,
wearing a Yankees' cap, on the other. It's all part of the Pete
Rose Traveling Road Show, complete with well-rehearsed one-liners _
``I mean, Charles Manson gets a hearing once a year, doesn't he?''
_ and earnest declarations of his continued devotion to baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Rose, with his bad haircut, has become a caricature of himself,
a shill whose message has become shrill and tired. The act should
be well-polished; he has been practicing it on his syndicated radio
show for the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   No one questions Rose's love for the game. The only thing he
clearly loves more is himself.
</P>
<P>
   Braves bench coach and former Rangers manager Pat Corrales once
said that he never played with a more selfish player in his life
than Rose, but that was OK because Pete played the game to win.
</P>
<P>
   Things haven't changed much.
</P>
<P>
   Rose remains as self-centered as ever. It's not that his cause
isn't just or that he doesn't deserve to be in the Hall of Fame.
It's his tacky, I'm-going-to-be-me approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot help but like Pete Rose,'' said his old Big Red
Machine teammate Johnny Bench when the rest of the All-Century Team
gathered earlier in the day. ``Baseball rules is where the
separation is. Rules are rules, whatever your name is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in America, from the president on down, who's had a
problem has always said, `I'm sorry.' America loves to forgive and
forget. If that were enough to do it, I would almost beg and plead
that he do it. He shouldn't be short-changed from being in the Hall
of Fame if there's a way of getting around it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's at least part of the problem. Rose, as defiant as ever
even though baseball investigator John Dowd allegedly found betting
slips with his fingerprints on them, still semantically waltzes
around the issue of remorse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is not going to hear me say, `I'm sorry,' '' Rose
said defensively. ``Do you honestly think I'm glad this happened?
Does Johnny?
</P>
<P>
   ``I would do anything in my power to change what has happened to
me in the last 10 years. You know how I feel. You know I'm sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, being sorry for what has happened to him doesn't
necessarily translate into regrets over breaking baseball's
most-sacred taboo. Rose has never publicly admitted to gambling on
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're ticklish about gambling,'' Rose admitted. ``I know
that as well as anybody. More than anybody, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   He has never, Rose said before the event, met or even talked to
Selig, who has steadfastly refused to review the suspension handed
down by the late Bart Giamatti 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That could change if Selig decides to suspend himself. He and
``Charlie Hustle'' will suddenly have a lot in common. nn

TOP RANK OFFICIALS HOPE TO SEE AYALA ON SHOWTIME, HBO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSE SANCHEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Moments after successfully defending his
World Boxing Association bantamweight title with a unanimous
decision against Saohin Srithai Condo on Saturday at Will Rogers
Coliseum, a victorious Paulie Ayala chuckled in his dressing room.
</P>
<P>
   Sporting bruises on his ears and wounds on the left side of his
swollen face, the champion was forced to do something he rarely
does _ turn down an autograph seeker.
</P>
<P>
   After 12 rounds of throwing left hooks and uppercuts to the
right side of Condo's face, Ayala's dominant hand sat swollen in a
bucket of ice water. He couldn't sign an autograph if he wanted to.
</P>
<P>
   ``He \RCondo\S had a hard face,'' said Ayala, who improved to
29-1, with 12 knockouts. ``I wasn't hitting him on the top of the
head; I was hitting him with uppercuts.''
</P>
<P>
   I guess it's where they got the saying `it's going to hurt me a
lot more than it's going to hurt you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ayala's left hand was examined by a doctor yesterday, but X-rays
showed no signs of broken bones. He did, however, bleed from the
nose in the ring for the first time since his nose was originally
broken in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   His bumps, bruises, and more importantly, victories, are not
going unnoticed, said Lee Samuels spokesman for Top Rank Inc.,
Ayala's promotional team. By defeating Johnny Tapia for the title
and successfully defending against Condo, Ayala has established
himself as a legitimate star with 24 consecutive rounds of
excitement, Samuels said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took a giant step against Tapia, another against Condo, and
he is the only action fighter out there right now, '' Samuels said.
``I will personally call Nigel Collins \Reditor of Ring Magazine\S
and let him know about Paulie.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuels said Top Rank Inc., is nominating Ayala-Tapia and
Ayala-Condo for The Ring Magazine's Fight of the Year, along with
Ayala as Fighter of the Year. Ayala is the only nominee in either
category for the organization, who also promotes Oscar De La Hoya
and Floyd Mayweather.
</P>
<P>
   Top Rank Inc., will also be pursuing contracts with HBO and
Showtime for Ayala, according to matchmaker Bruce Trampler.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I propose to do is to send cassettes to HBO and Showtime
people, and try and interest them, '' Trampler said. `` They both
said they are trying to go Hispanic, and Ayala typifies where they
should be. Regardless, it's not a matter of who he fights anymore,
it's for whom he fights.''
</P>
<P>
   Trampler also said there could be more championship bouts in
Fort Worth for Ayala, and Top Rank Inc., is considering making the
city synonymous with Ayala's career on a national level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?, Trampler said. ``Romero has Albuquerque, Paulie has
Fort Worth. It could work. ''
</P>
<P>
   As for the champion, he will not fight until next year, and
remains confident about his future in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I proved I'm a force to be reckoned with, a champion to be
reckoned with,'' Ayala said. ``I've always said it from the
beginning, I just needed the opportunity. Now that I have it, I'm
going to make the best of it.''

TOP FUEL LEADER SCHUMACHER ENDS DROUGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENNIS, Texas _ Second-generation drag racer Tony Schumacher made
sure that he will not be the second answer to a National Hot Rod
Association trivia question at the Texas Motorplex yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   And now the only question facing Schumacher during the season's
stretch run is this: Can he win the NHRA's prestigious Top Fuel
championship in his first full season?
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher took care of the trivia when he defeated Scott
Kalitta, a former two-time Top Fuel champion, in the final of the
14th annual O'Reilly Fall Nationals. Rob Bruins failed to win a
race en route to the 1979 NHRA Top Fuel title. He remains the only
professional champion never to have visited Victory Lane during the
course of his title-winning campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A nonwinner in eight previous final-round appearances stretching
back to the summer of 1998, Schumacher covered the all-concrete
Motorplex quarter-mile in 4.621 seconds and 323.39 mph in the Exide
Batteries Dragster to defeat Kalitta. The race's No. 1 qualifier,
Kalitta slowed to 5.072 seconds at 205.62 mph after giving
Schumacher a race up to halftrack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was weird because I saw him at half track, and I went,
`What, are you joking?''' said Schumacher, of Park Ridge, Ill.
``And all of a sudden he disappeared _ and that was really cool. I
went around him, and that's it. You're done. We ran 323, so if I'm
an inch ahead of you, you're not catching me at that point. That's
what makes it cool. Love it.''
</P>
<P>
   While Schumacher was busy clutching his first NHRA Oscar,
multiple-champions John Force and Warren Johnson were adding to
their considerable hardware collections. Force won the Funny Car
final over Tommy Johnson Jr. after clinching his record ninth
Winston championship _ and seventh in a row _ earlier in the
afternoon. Only the retired Bob Glidden, with 10 Pro Stock titles,
has won more NHRA championships than ``Brute'' Force. The victory
was the 80th in Force's career, five behind Glidden's all-time
record.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, meanwhile, claimed his fifth career Pro Stock title and
second in a row with a victory over former two-time series champion
Jim Yates. Johnson, of Sugar Hill, Ga., also posted his 79th career
victory in the GM Goodwrench Pontiac Firebird, third all-time
behind Glidden and Force.
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher began this meet with a 20-point lead over five-time
series champion Joe Amato. That translates into one round of
racing. Amato was eliminated in the second round by Doug Kalitta,
Scott's cousin, leaving Schumacher with an 81-point lead heading
into the Matco Tools Supernationals at Houston Raceway Park in
Baytown next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The season-ending NHRA Finals are scheduled for Pomona (Calif.)
Raceway on Nov. 11-14.
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher, 29, is the son of Don Schumacher, one of drag
racing's most successful Funny Car drivers when he retired in 1974.
The elder Schumacher and his team made their debut at the U.S.
Nationals over Labor Day weekend in 1998. A little over a year
later, they are poised to shock the establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Force, of Yorba Linda, Calif., clinched his title when teammate
Tony Pedregon was eliminated by Whit Bazemore's Kendall Chevrolet
Camaro Z/28 in the second round. Force commiserated briefly with
his teammate, but added that overall it had been a great day for
John Force Racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking I'll never make it to the press room,'' said
Force, referring to the winner's postrace news conference. But
Force ran 4.827 seconds at 319.60 mph in the Castrol GTX Ford
Mustang. Johnson, who learned Friday that owner Joe Gibbs' team was
losing its sponsorship from Interstate Batteries at season's end,
ran 4.843 seconds/319.82 mph. That made it the quickest
side-by-side race in Funny Car history.

TOP 100 COUNTDOWN, NO. 68: `OLDEN BEAR' LOOKS GOLDEN IN WINNING
1986 MASTERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDY FRIEDLANDER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The crowd at the Augusta National Golf Club roared. But the Bear
roared louder.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicklaus had earned the nickname The Golden Bear with 17
victories in the majors and two U.S. Amateur titlesheading into the
1986 Masters, but the last of them had come six years earlier, when
he had won the U.S. Open and PGA Championship at age 40.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Nicklaus had won only twice, leading to the
conclusion that he could no longer compete at the highest level.
His 1980 victories were considered a heroic last hurrah from one of
the game's greatest players. So sure of this were the pundits that
the week before the Masters, an Atlanta newspaper mockingly
referred to the 46-year-old Nicklaus as The Olden Bear and said his
chances of winning his record sixth green jacket were all but nil.
</P>
<P>
   After two rounds, there was little room for argument. Nicklaus
shot 74 and 71, good enough to stick around for the weekend, but
hardly in contention. And while his 69 on Saturday pleased the
crowd and left him four shots behind leader Greg Norman, Nicklaus
was not on anybody's list of serious contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Eight holes into Sunday's final round, Nicklaus, still at 2
under par, trailed Seve Ballesteros by six shots. Suddenly, he
found his touch. He birdied nine, 10 and 11, and the large gallery
that always followed the Bear began to rumble.
</P>
<P>
   After a bogey at 12, Nicklaus dropped in another birdie at 13
and then drilled a 202-yard 4-iron to within 12 feet on the par-5
15th. When he holed the putt for eagle to move within two shots of
Ballesteros, the crowd erupted in cheers that could be heard in
every corner of the Augusta course.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so loud,'' Norman said, ``it made the U.S. Open seem
like playing around a graveyard.''
</P>
<P>
   It was soon to get louder. While Ballesteros was hitting into
Rae's Creek on 15, Nicklaus hit the shot of the day at the par-3
16th, missing a hole-in-one by inches. After another birdie, he
shared the lead and it seemed the entire population of Augusta was
screaming in delight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming from the tee to the green it was actually deafening,''
Nicklaus said. ``The people were absolutely unbelievable. I
couldn't hear a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   A birdie at 17 put Nicklaus in front by himself, and when he had
finished his 65 _ including a record-tying 30 on the back nine _ he
was escorted to the Bobby Jones Cabin to watch the challengers take
their best shots. One by one they fell away. Ballesteros bogeyed
17. Tom Kite, needing a birdie at 18 to force a playoff, left a
12-foot putt short.
</P>
<P>
   And Norman, who had fallen back early but charged down the
stretch with four consecutive birdies to grab a share of the lead,
hit his second shot on 18 into the gallery and wound up needing a
16-footer for par to tie. His putt slid past, leaving Nicklaus atop
the golf world again.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said I was done, washed up, through, that I had no
chance,'' Nicklaus said. ``I was thinking all week, `So I'm washed
up, huh?' Something like that can really spur you on. ... I think I
showed today that occasionally I can still play this game.''

PRECEDENCE ASIDE, TYSON WON'T BE DISQUALIFIED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Mike Tyson probably didn't mean it and will get his
$10 million, Orlin Norris is injured and boxing _ such as it is _
goes on.
</P>
<P>
   The Nevada State Athletic Commission will review Saturday's
debacle, which ended as a ``no contest'' when Tyson landed a punch
after the bell and Norris injured his right knee when he fell.
</P>
<P>
   However, don't expect the commission to overturn referee Richard
Steele's ruling that the punch was an ``accidental foul'' and
disqualify or suspend Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Ratner, the director of the commission, said the governing
body has that power but intimated that such a move is highly
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   So, you get what you got: a mess.
</P>
<P>
   Norris, who dislocated his kneecap, an MRI revealed, believes
the punch was unintentional and that Tyson likely didn't hear the
bell, as he contends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an intense first round,'' he said. ``We both were
throwing punches and fighting out of the round's final clinch. It
was also very noisy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly feel that Mike did not foul me intentionally.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there is precedent to DQ Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Norris' own brother, Terry Norris, was disqualified twice
against Luis Santana, once for a punch after the bell and once for
hitting Santana in the back of the head.
</P>
<P>
   Another example is Roy Jones Jr., who was DQed when he punched
Montell Griffin when Griffin's knee was on the canvas.
</P>
<P>
   Were their indiscretions more malicious than that of Tyson, who
hit Norris with a left hook a good two seconds after the bell to
end an uneventful first and only round?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, not.
</P>
<P>
   However, again, the commission will be reluctant to overturn
what is a judgment call by the referee and create a bigger mess in
the process.
</P>
<P>
   That means Tyson's $10 million, which was withheld pending the
hearing on Thursday, probably will be turned over to him and the
fighters will move on with their careers.
</P>
<P>
   For Norris, that could be a while.
</P>
<P>
   He was taken to a local hospital for an MRI. He returned to his
hotel 2{ hours later on crutches and in pain, according to adviser
Michael Marley.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, ring doctor Flip Homansky confirmed what he believed
immediately after the fight: That Norris' knee !ital!had!off! been
damaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The MRI clearly shows the path his kneecap took when he went
to the ground,'' Homansky said. ``When he stood up, it popped back
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way he could have continued. He very well might
need surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless Homansky is wrong, that would seem to refute Tyson's
claims that Norris threw the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son was hurt. He's no quitter,'' said Orlin Norris Sr., the
fighter's father.
</P>
<P>
   Norris' handlers were reluctant to talk until after the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, they'd love a rematch and the money that goes with
it. Norris made $800,000 for his three-minute's work and presumably
would command a similar payday if the fighters meet again.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Woodworth, Norris' manager, said he would withhold comment
``until all the legal ramifications are taken care of,'' the
implication being he wants to do everything possible to force a
rematch.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Goossen, Tyson's promoter, said immediately after the fight
that a rematch was a possibility but later backed off, saying it
was important to sort out this mess before making any plans.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson is tentatively scheduled to fight Shannon Briggs on Feb.
26 at Madison Square Garden in New York, but no official
announcement has been made.
</P>
<P>
   What can we expect in that one? When Tyson's involved, anything.
</P>
<P>
   The latest incident was remarkably bizarre _ but no one was
terribly surprised.
</P>
<P>
   In his previous two fights, he chewed on the ears of Evander
Holyfield and admitted he tried to break the arm of Francois Botha
in a clinch.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the biggest gamble in Las Vegas is buying a ticket to
see Tyson fight.
</P>
<P>
   Ask anyone who paid to see Saturday's fight. Never has there
been a more disgusted group of sports fans, who let their disdain
be known with boos and expletives until well after the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Said one frustrated woman: ``They have to give us a refund,
don't they?''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, no. That's boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement?: Tyson's postfight comments about leaving the sport
were made in frustration. Obviously, he believes the world has
stuck it to him one more time.
</P>
<P>
   When he was asked why he was penalized two points for the late
punch, he said, ``Because I'm Mike Tyson.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he won't retire just yet.
</P>
<P>
   He knows this is the only way he can make this kind of money; he
must pay off debts and provide for his family.
</P>
<P>
   Clarification: The fact that Steele took points from Tyson is
consistent with the ``accidental foul'' ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Fighters lose points all the time on fouls they don't mean to
commit.
</P>
<P>
   Down and out?: Robert Garcia had always said he'd retire if he
lost a fight. He's talked about returning to school and starting
another career, possibly as a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's not so sure. He doesn't want to go out this way.
</P>
<P>
   The Oxnard resident was brutally knocked out by Diego Corrales
in the seventh round on the Tyson-Norris undercard to lose his IBF
junior lightweight championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to prove I'm not a quitter,'' he said Sunday morning.
``Great fighters lose, they come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'll try to get a shot at another world title. I just
want to talk to my family first.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, who was winning the bout against the 6-foot Corrales
through five rounds, couldn't pinpoint exactly what went wrong
after that. He went down three times from right hands, the last
time for good.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested he left himself open to punches after he missed his
own shots, but settled on a more simple explanation. ``Hey, he
caught me with a good shot. That's boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   Another debacle: It was an unfortunate weekend for boxing.
</P>
<P>
   The night before Tyson-Norris, Naseem Hamed and Cesar Soto
turned a promising featherweight matchup into a pathetic wrestling
match in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Hamed should've been disqualified for flipping Soto in the fifth
round. If nothing else, fans in Detroit and watching TV would've
been spared the remainder of the fight.
</P>
<P>
   On the same card, junior featherweights Erik Morales and Wayne
McCullough engaged in a thrilling brawl.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't terribly competitive; Morales won handily. However,
the fighters were willing to take punches to give them, and it made
for an exciting show.
</P>
<P>
   Morales is probably the fighter who can beat Hamed if the
overrated Englishman has the guts to face him.
</P>
<P>
   McCullough doesn't have the power to become a great fighter but
his courage and determination should be a lesson to other fighters.

CHILL OUT, FOLKS, BCS STANDINGS DON'T MEAN MUCH NOW
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perfect. The first edition of the 1999 Bowl Championship Series
rankings will be announced at halftime of tonight's
Atlanta-Pittsburgh (yech!) ``Monday Night Football'' game. This
marriage of pro and college football is brought to you by ABC
Sports, which is engaging in typical TV cross promotion (it's the
home of the BCS).
</P>
<P>
   The BCS rankings, which incorporate the writers and coaches
polls, eight computer ratings, strength of schedule and won-loss
record, will be used for the second consecutive year to determine
who plays for the national title. Being No. 2 is as important as
being No. 1, so there will be considerable interest in the debut
list.
</P>
<P>
   And here's why this is such a super, synergistic coupling: Just
over a month into the NFL season, it's obvious there is no domiant
team. And with just over a month to go, it's just as apparent there
is no true No. 1 team in college football.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Florida State is No. 1 and will stay there after a 17-14
victory over Clemson in a family feud. But the Seminoles certainly
have not been running roughshod over Division I-A foes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we played like No. 1,'' Florida State coach
Bobby Bowden said. ``But whoever's No. 2 probably didn't play like
No. 2 either.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be Penn State, which survived four Drew Brees passes
that would have given Purdue an upset victory. Clearly, it doesn't
matter where a team is ranked; every game is a landmine.
</P>
<P>
   Last season turned into a three-month playoff that ended with a
dramatic final Saturday. This season is shaping up the same way.
Florida State, Penn State, Virginia Tech, Kansas State and
Mississippi State are the remaining undefeated teams hoping for a
chance to play in the Sugar Bowl on Jan. 4. Tennessee and Florida
each have one loss but are still in the hunt. Georgia Tech and
Nebraska are one-loss long shots.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech and Tennessee will have particular interest in BCS
Version 1.
</P>
<P>
   The defending champion Volunteers (5-1) are sneaking into
position for a title run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a new motto: Why not us?'' said Tennessee coach
Phillip Fulmer, who has won six of his past seven games against Top
10 opponents. ``You look around the country, and there may not be a
great football team or one dominant team. Why can't we take this
thing?''
</P>
<P>
   Who knew that when Tennessee lost at Florida that it was
advantage, Volunteers. Tennessee could wind up finishing second in
the Southeastern Conference East division and still play in the
Sugar Bowl. Florida, which has tough games with Georgia and Florida
State remaining, could face a rematch with Alabama in the SEC
championship game. And speaking of rematches, a Tennessee-Florida
national title game in the Sugar Bowl is not out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know where, but we should be ranked up there,''
Tennessee senior quarterback Tee Martin said after his team's 21-7
victory over Alabama. ``You never know what's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hokies (6-0) are in prime position to finish undefeated. The
question is Virginia Tech's strength of schedule. It opened the
season with a victory over Division I-AA James Madison. Plus, the
Hokies play Miami and Boston College, teams whose schedule strength
will be diminished because of games against I-AA teams. And, the
Big East Conference's overall weakness likely will effect Virginia
Tech's computer profile.
</P>
<P>
   And now time for a plea of sanity. For the rest of the season,
there will be hours of talk show and inches of newspaper copy
produced about the system's inequities, debating the pros and cons,
the whys and the why nots. Take a chill pill, folks. It doesn't
matter where a team is BCS-ranked on Oct. 25 or Nov. 15. All that
matters is which teams are No. 1 and No. 2 on Dec. 5 when the final
BCS poll is released.
</P>
<P>
   That's why they play the games. nn

NBA RULES CHANGES A BOON TO SCORERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the past few years, NBA commissioner David Stern noticed his
sport turning into something this side of the World Wrestling
Federation and decided changes were in order.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the bump-and-grind physical play that had become so
common in the NBA, that many games ended before either team scored
90 points. Gone, too, are those stale plays when players like
Charles Barkley would dribble over half of the 24-second shot clock
away with his back to the basket, then shoot the ball at the last
possible second.
</P>
<P>
   Over the off-season, Stern inserted a batch of new rules that
are designed to increase scoring, decrease physical play,
entertain, and show off the gracefulness and athleticism of his
players. In short, slashers are in, and hand- and body-checking is
out.
</P>
<P>
   Don Nelson, who doubles as the Mavericks' coach and general
manager, said the players will make the necessary adjustments to
the less-than- physical style of play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to play, everybody wants to stay on the
court,'' Nelson said. ``So they'll do what the rules are enforced
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Players with explosive first steps like Philadephia's Allen
Iverson, New Jersey's Stephon Marbury, Mavericks point guard Robert
Pack, and Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers will be difficult
to defend, because hand-checking and use of forearms while playing
defense above the free-throw line is prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively, you like the rule,'' Pack said. ``But defensively
you're like, `Man, I can't touch this guy?'
</P>
<P>
   ``You're used to putting the forearm on the guy to kind of
direct him sometimes, and you're used to being a little physical.
But this hurts you on the defensive end. The guys who adapt to the
rules the best and the quickest are the ones who are going to be
able to take advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks center Shawn Bradley, who has averaged 3.4 blocks for
his career, is salivating at the mere thought of having so many
defenders attacking the basket because of the no hand-checking
rule. That means Bradley could shatter his single-season high of
288 blocks, because he's going to have more players flying at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new rules are going to be a benefit for teams that have a
guy in the middle that can block shots, and we have that,'' Bradley
said. ``So hopefully we can use that to our advantage this year,
even moreso than in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Another new rule forbids a player from impeding the movement of
an offensive player not in possession of the ball. Also, dislodging
a player in the post is considered a no-no.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a player must pick up his dribble, shoot or pass
the ball within five seconds if he's dribbling with his back to the
basket below the free-throw line. This affects Mavericks forward
Gary Trent, Miami center Alonzo Mourning and Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   The downside of the new rules are the potential for longer
games, because free-throw attempts will increase if the referees
closely enforce the rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first couple of months it's going to slow the game
down,'' Mavericks guard Michael Finley said. ``You're going to have
games with 100 fouls called, but as time goes on and people get
used to it, hopefully it won't be as many fouls called.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think the new rules are going to help me a lot. It's
going to take more of a skills guy to play this game, and for the
most part that'll benefit me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks guard Steve Nash said the fans probably won't notice
that the game has been slightly altered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NBA has changed rules before, and they're never as bad as
they seem and they're never as good as they seem,'' Nash said.
``They always somehow find a middle ground where they improve the
game slightly, but they don't really make the drastic effect that
everyone thinks they're going to make.''

L.A. COOLS ITS HEELS AWAITING OPPONENT

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The Los Angeles Galaxy's 2-0 sweep of Colorado gives
coach Sigi Schmid a full week to prepare for the Western Conference
finals, which starts at 2:30 p.m. Sunday at the Rose Bowl against
either Chicago or Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Schmid hopes Chicago and Dallas beat each other up in
Wednesday's third and deciding game at the Cotton Bowl. Dallas won
the first game 1-0, and Chicago evened the series with a 4-0
triumph Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just played a tough series with Colorado,'' Schmid said.
``When you play a series like this you have people banged up. We
can use the extra rest. Now we can watch Dallas and Chicago kick
the (heck) out of each other for a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Double duty: Galaxy striker Carlos Hermosillo's MLS contract
will expire Sunday. When the MLS signed Hermosillo to a two-year
contract, the league expected the MLS championship to be completed
in October. For the first time, the championship will be played in
November, meaning Hermosillo becomes Necaxa's property Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Not worried, Schmid said everything will be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have already come to an arrangement with all the
appropriate parties,'' Schmid said.
</P>
<P>
   Franchino's first: Joey Franchino scored the first MLS goal of
his career in Sunday's victory. Franchino was a 79th-minute
insertion and scored in the 84th minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came in thinking defense to solidify the 1-0 lead,'' he
said. ``I was fortunate to get a goal.''

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
ATLANTA _ Dom or the cheap stuff?
<TEXT>
<P>
   Broadway or Park Avenue?
</P>
<P>
   Those decisions are the challenges awaiting the New York Yankees
when they return home, presumably to put an end to this World
Series charade. What about the Atlanta Braves?
</P>
<P>
   At this point, they hardly warrant concern. The Braves barely
showed up in Sunday's 7-2 loss in Game 2. The Yankees took a 2-0
lead in the best-of-seven series, which shifts to New York for the
next three scheduled games, beginning Tuesday at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we took a little wind out of their sails,'' Yankees
starter David Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe they totally deflated the Braves, who have lost six
consecutive World Series games _ all to the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   New York ripped Braves starter Kevin Millwood for three runs in
the first inning and two in the third, immediately zapping any
suspense from the game. Meanwhile, Cone was having his way with the
Braves' hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Cone pitched four no-hit innings and the first seven innings of
a combined five-hitter with relievers Ramiro Mendoza and Jeff
Nelson. The Braves have only seven hits in the first two games of
the Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't hit many balls hard at all,'' Braves hitting
instructor Don Baylor said. ``They've shut us down. We've had
periods of inconsistency like this before. You can get by with it
in the middle of the regular season, but they (the Yankees) are two
games away from a world title. We're running out of time.''
</P>
<P>
   While a two-game deficit isn't exactly a death sentence for a
team with the Braves' pitching, the New Yorkers wouldn't be out of
line if they've already placed the champagne order, mapped out a
parade route and refamiliarized themselves with the riot-control
plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves may not be totally done, but they're certainly
starting to brown on both sides. On Sunday, they added poor
pitching and sloppy defense to their real poison _ the lack of any
semblance of offense _ forming a deadly concoction.
</P>
<P>
   Braves manager Bobby Cox benched his best defensive infielders
in favor of more offense. The result was a few Yankees singles that
made it through the infield only because of the declining range of
Ozzie Guillen and Keith Lockhart, neither of whom added an ounce of
spark to the Braves' offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like no matter where I was playing, the ball was
always a little bit out of reach,'' said Lockhart, who started at
second base. ``The Yankees were finding all of the holes. When a
team is hitting the ball well, that's what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who extended their World Series winning streak to
10 games dating to 1996, pounded out 14 hits. At their current
rate, the Braves won't collect their 14th hit of the Series until
Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves were gracious hosts to the MasterCard All-Century
Team prior to Sunday's game. Perhaps MasterCard could return the
favor by letting the Braves have a few hits on credit. The NL
champions apparently exceeded their limit somewhere around the
Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating,'' Cox said. ``We kept waiting to get
something going. David kept the ball down; he had breaking stuff.
He wasn't overpowering at all. He didn't throw that hard, but his
ball was sinking like crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   With a .202 opponents' batting average during the regular
season, Millwood was the toughest pitcher to hit against in the
Senior Circuit. The Yankees, who have won 20 of their last 23
postseason games, weren't impressed.
</P>
<P>
   They treated Millwood like a pitching machine in one of those
interactive arcades, dialing up five runs on eight hits in two
innings plus against the young righthander.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the first seven Yankees reached base against Millwood,
who didn't have his usual pinpoint command from the very beginning.
Paul O'Neill, Tino Martinez and Scott Brosius each had RBI singles
in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood appeared to settle down after the second, but it was
only an illusion. The Yankees tagged him for three consecutive hits
to lead off the third, including an RBI double by Ricky Ledee, who
essentially ended Millwood's night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight Kevin was kind of in the middle of the plate where he
shouldn't have been,'' Cox said. ``It was all a matter of location.
He got right in that area that's good to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   It was almost as if the Braves had two starting pitchers,
considering Terry Mulholland began warming up in the bullpen in the
first inning before eventually replacing Millwood in the third.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees added a fifth run in the third when Guillen dropped
a soft liner _ it would have been the third out of the inning _
allowing Martinez to score from third. Chuck Knoblauch's RBI single
gave the Yankees a seven-run lead in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Greg Myers, who had two of the Braves' five hits, broke
up the Yankees' shutout with a two-out RBI single off Mendoza in
the ninth. Nelson, who served up a pinch-hit RBI double to Bret
Boone, notched the final out to secure the victory.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ATLANTA _ For the Yankees, it was like a living tribute to the
greatest names in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   To the Babe and Joltin' Joe. To the Iron Horse. To the Mick and
Yogi.
</P>
<P>
   Of all those great Yankees, only Yogi Berra was at Turner Field
on Sunday night when the game's All-Century Team was honored before
Game 2 of the World Series. But it also was as if they all were
there.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet swings. Pitching flawlessly. Showing classic Yankees
greatness.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if echoes from those unforgettable days bounced off
the rafters of Turner Field and reverberated into the hearts of
these 1999 Yanks.
</P>
<P>
   David Cone was dominant and gritty. Derek Jeter and Scott
Brosius were virtually unstoppable and clutch. Bernie Williams and
Tino Martinez carried powerful and mighty sticks.
</P>
<P>
   The defense was impeccable, the hitting timely and the onslaught
relentless.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees just kept coming, like blasts from the past, and
buried the Braves for the second night in a row, this time 7-2, to
take a 2-0 World Series edge.
</P>
<P>
   But the most enlightening image of the night wasn't only the
Yankees falling into a groove for the ages, but the Braves
continuing to fade and droop.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if the Braves' night also was dedicated to one of
baseball's greatest names _ one that didn't quite make it to the
All-Century Team but epitomized this night and what the Series has
become.
</P>
<P>
   Enos Slaughter. The Braves were. Slaughtered, that is.
</P>
<P>
   And now might be a good time to abridge all World Series
predictions: Yanks in two. It's over; the rest is details.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees all but clinched this final Series of the 1900s with
a classic show of pinstripe dominance, chasing Braves ace Kevin
Millwood early while hammering out 14 hits and looking unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   With the Series returning to New York and the potentially
dominant Andy Pettitte and Roger Clemens scheduled to start Games 3
and 4, it looks like a question not of if, but of when.
</P>
<P>
   The only intriguing questions remaining in this Series might be
these: Will the Braves get swept? And will Pete Rose deck NBC
reporter Jim Gray if the two cross paths between here and the
Bronx?
</P>
<P>
   Little did we know Sunday night that the most heated showdown we
would see would be the pre-game exchange between Gray and Rose
during an interview about Rose's lifetime baseball ban.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have been meek from the start of this Series, and no
one has epitomized the uncharacteristic instability more than
manager Bobby Cox. Usually steady and true with his moves, Cox has
seen almost everything he has done backfire.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Cox started young talent Millwood, hoping Millwood could
win in front of the home crowd and leaving the playoff-tested Tom
Glavine and John Smoltz for the hostile confines of Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But Millwood didn't make it out of the third inning, giving up
five runs on eight hits and all but clinching the Yanks' 10th
consecutive win in the World Series _ six in a row over the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Cox also tried to shake up the lineup for Sunday's game, with
equal success. After the Braves could muster just two hits in the
Game 1 loss, Cox inserted Ozzie Guillen, Keith Lockhart and Greg
Myers into the lineup instead of defensive whiz Walt Weiss,
National League Championship Series hero Eddie Perez and Bret
Boone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just trying to find some offense,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   But he lost probably his best defensive infielder with the move
_ Weiss _ and it cost the Braves dearly when Guillen committed a
huge gaffe in the third inning. Guillen dropped a soft liner off
Cone's bat that could have ended a jam but only made it worse.
Guillen also went oh-fer on the night offensively, as did Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played a bad game. We got beat up,'' Cox said. ``We're a
team of good pitching and timely hitting and didn't get it. It's
frustrating, but I don't know if it's helpless.''
</P>
<P>
   It is. There are those who will tell you this burning of Atlanta
can be reversed with just a few more tweaks by Cox and some better
luck. They'll remind you of the 1996 World Series, when the Braves
hammered out a couple of wins at Yankee Stadium, then lost four in
a row.
</P>
<P>
   But this Series is all but over because the Yanks' 2-0 edge not
only sapped the life out of the Braves but sent them looking for
answers that aren't there.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees pitchers have proved to be better than their Braves
counterparts. Pettitte and Clemens should continue the trend.
Offensively, the Yanks have dominated without falling into a big
groove.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have not hit a home run in the Series, and nothing
but singles accounted for their first six runs of the two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not really completely happy with how we've played,''
Yankees manager Joe Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   That's the scary part.
</P>
<P>
   This thing is over.

IS NORTHRIDGE ON THE MOVE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Boise State and Louisiana Tech went to the Western
Athletic Conference. Texas Christian bolted the WAC for Conference
USA.
</P>
<P>
   The dominoes are falling. Will Cal State Northridge be the next
athletic program to make a switch?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hate to make odds, but I think there is certainly that
possibility,'' CSUN athletic director Dick Dull said last week in
the wake of the maneuvering that has a ripple effect on the Big
West, a conference seeming to be a good fit for the Matadors. ``I
met with (Big West Commissioner) Doug Farrell a month ago. At that
point, I was gathering formation; we talked about what was going
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel this institution is best served if (it) develops all
its options.''
</P>
<P>
   Dull said he's happy with CSUN's membership in the Big Sky
Conference, but the Big Sky might not be as pleased with
Northridge. The conference has repeatedly allowed CSUN to maintain
its stay in the Big Sky even though it has done little or nothing
to upgrade its facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``For any institution to leave, you have to give a one-year
notice,'' Dull said. ``We don't have any place to go. Right now,
we're a Big Sky member.''
</P>
<P>
   Farrell, who couldn't be reached for this story, may be courting
several schools for the openings left by the departures of Boise
State and Nevada, which also is going to the WAC.
</P>
<P>
   UC Riverside and Sacramento State are possibilities. UC
Riverside is in the transition of moving up from Division II to
Division I, and even Dull admits Sac State seems to be a good fit
to remain in the Big Sky.
</P>
<P>
   Name that game: Dull is trying to nail down non-conference
football games for next season. The Matadors added Cal Poly San
Luis Obispo and are advertising in NCAA News for two more
opponents, including one from the I-A.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a couple of people we've talked with,'' Dull said,
adding he's looking for a I-A road game because ``that's tied to
revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   That means CSUN is looking for a payout similar to the $200,000
the program received for playing at Kansas this season.
</P>
<P>
   Two I-AA non-conference possibilities for CSUN _ New Hampshire
and Florida A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce a possibility: Next year's home schedule will be played
at North Campus Stadium, regardless of the proposed student fee
increase that could generate financing for a new 8,500-seat
facility.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors could be playing the 2001 season at Pierce College,
however, if the referendum fails; North Campus Stadium is scheduled
to be demolished that summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the short run, that's an option,'' Dull said of playing at
Pierce. ``We have a short-term problem we need to address.''
</P>
<P>
   Deep position: Bobby Braswell, the head men's basketball coach,
said every starting position is open. Incumbents Brian Heinle,
Andre Larry and Jeff Parris seem to be safe at the center and two
forward positions, though.
</P>
<P>
   An interesting battle is in the backcourt, where returnees
Markus Carr and Carl Holmes and junior college transfer Marco
McCain will be competing for two spots.
</P>
<P>
   Carr, a sophomore from Palmdale who averaged a team-leading 4.4
assists last year, probably will start at point guard. Holmes, a
junior, averaged 6.1 points per game in 1998-99. McCain was a key
player on Cerritos College's state championship team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great opportunity for Carl to step in and get some
minutes,'' Braswell said.
</P>
<P>
   Whoa, Nellie: The men's basketball team picked up a
non-scholarship player in freshman Keith Jackson, a walk-on from
St. Bernard High in Playa Del Rey.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Jackson)'s got a great basketball IQ,'' said Braswell, who
invited Jackson to try out the week before practice began. ``He's
also a personable guy.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ The party was for Charles Barkley, but he gave
away the presents.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``No, nothing, I don't want anything,'' Barkley said of the
rocking chairs and fishing rods that so often accompany the sort of
farewell tours that he began Sunday. ``I've got everything. There's
no use giving me anything. I don't need any more.''
</P>
<P>
   So to mark the occasion of his official retirement announcement
Sunday, Barkley dropped off parting gifts before beginning the end
of his career. He gave $1 million each to his scholarship funds at
Leeds (Ala.) High School and Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   He gave another $1 million for a scholarship at the Cornerstone
School, an inner-city school in Birmingham. And with his return to
play after four games resting a sore elbow, he helped give the
Rockets a 98-96 win over the Detroit Pistons that they admitted,
even in the preseason, they had to have.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets had to rally from eight points back in the final
four minutes against the Pistons' guests from the Yakima Sun Kings.
But that hardly mattered. With the preseason-closing games against
the Spurs to come this week, the Rockets avoided slipping to a
worrisome 1-5. And a victory allowed a night devoted to celebrating
Barkley's career to end happily.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed a win,'' Rockets center Kelvin Cato said. ``We
needed to come together and have something positive. Everybody's
played well, but we haven't played well together. And it was great
to see Chuck get a win on his day. But he's not gone yet. We'll
talk about it after 82 games and the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The impact of Barkley's return was obvious from the outset. He
had nine assists, five before taking his first shot, and nine
rebounds. He made five of eight shots for 13 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great to have Charles back,'' Rockets coach Rudy
Tomjanovich said. ``He really does make a difference. His
experience is invaluable. His passing _ he's such a complete
player. With his retirement, it was good to see someone honor him.
He's done so much for the league. I always enjoyed watching him
play because of his passion. I like the guy so much, I want to see
him get his due.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barkley said he has gotten all he wants, more than he ever
expected. He said he cannot imagine how even the NBA championship
that has eluded him could enrich his life. For that matter, he did
not know how he could be happier.
</P>
<P>
   But he plans to try to find out.
</P>
<P>
   He said Sunday he is negotiating to purchase a private jet. He
plans to take golf lessons and then to play four hours of golf a
day to finally get his first victory over Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He talks about you like a dog when he beats you,'' Barkley
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has considered several film roles, having decided the
situation comedy and talk-show offers that have been floated would
require too much work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously I'd like to do some acting,'' Barkley said. ``Some
(of the roles) are interesting. Some are terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he is still considering running for governor of Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to advance people,'' he said. ``I don't think God
gave me this gift so I can play basketball, have $50 million in the
bank and live happily ever after. It's good to have that. Don't get
me wrong. But there's more to life.''
</P>
<P>
   He even revealed his more immediate hopes to purchase an NBA
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could get one for a couple hundred million,'' he said,
``that would be a bargain.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would not want to purchase a team with Jordan, who
negotiated to buy the Charlotte Hornets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I would have to do what Michael tells me,'' Barkley said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why Jordan would be the controlling partner, Barkley
simply said, ``Because he's Michael.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Birmingham on Sunday, Barkley was the conquering hero
returned home. He was surrounded at a halftime ceremony by his
mother, Chauncey Glenn, his grandmother, Johnnie Mae Mickens, his
high school coach, Billy Copeland, and college coach, Sonny Smith.
</P>
<P>
   He was presented with a permanent plaque to be displayed in the
Birmingham-Jefferson Convention Complex. Birmingham Mayor William
Bell gave him a key to the city and declared the day ``Charles
Barkley Day.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, Barkley made his retirement decision official.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to announce that this is going to be my last season
here in Birmingham,'' Barkley told the crowd. ``You guys have been
with me from the beginning. Everybody else sort of jumped on the
bandwagon along the way. I appreciate everybody behind me for
really the last 19 years. I got a great opportunity being born in
Leeds. The people at Auburn were terrific to me, and the people of
Alabama have been great to me. Now I'm honored to finish my career
playing for the Houston Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no sadness in my mind or my voice. I mean it's time to
do something else. I'm going to have some fun now.''
</P>
<P>
   Tense in the first half, but with that out of the way, he seemed
to begin having fun in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   And though the Rockets continued to struggle _ they had 32
turnovers, including 11 by Steve Francis; they made just 42.1
percent of their shots _ they led by 15 early, came back to win
late and celebrated a favorite son throughout.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was emotional because I had a lot of family and friends
here tonight,'' Barkley said. ``Tonight was very stressful for me.
Tonight's the last time I am going to talk about the retirement
this year. I am going to get it over with. I'm glad it's out of the
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was stressful. I made the decision to go out and say it
with my family and friends there. Now, it's over.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
LAS VEGAS _ Somebody once said boxing was theater with blood. In
these desperate times, one might say the sport is more of a Three
Stooges routine without the deep intellectual meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Pierce Brosnan, the current big-screen portrayer of
James Bond, had it right as he rose from his ringside seat and
stalked out of the MGM Grand's Grand Garden Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a joke!'' sniffed 007.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Mike Tyson's latest misadventures Saturday night once
more left the fight crowd shaken, not stirred.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd grumbled. The crowd booed. The tense scene might have
gotten uglier if the ring hadn't quickly been filled by a greater
police presence than eventually caught up to Bonnie and Clyde.
</P>
<P>
   Just when you thought boxing had run out of eyes, Tyson managed
to blacken yet another one. He cheated everyone. Again.
</P>
<P>
   What he did was write another ugly, pathetic chapter in a
rapidly declining career that is marked by a succession of
controversies rather than a string of knockouts.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson clipped Orlin Norris with a left after the bell to end the
first round. Tyson claimed he did not hear the bell. But it is
difficult to believe he did not see referee Richard Steele, who had
his body between the two fighters when Tyson reached over his
shoulder to deliver the blow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just tired of the bull,'' Tyson said later.
</P>
<P>
   Aren't we all?
</P>
<P>
   Before the fight, Tyson virtually bragged, ``Nobody else could
have as many comebacks as me.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the question is, Who else would need so many?
</P>
<P>
   But when you're using the prime time of your career making a
tour of the nation's prison facilities, abusing wives, raping
beauty-pageant contestants, kicking and punching strangers and
attempting to mutilate your opponents in the ring, there seems to
always be another hill of perceived persecution to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Could there be something in the air at the MGM Grand _ the roar
of the lions? _ that brings out the animal in Tyson?
</P>
<P>
   It was in the very same ring in June 1997 where Tyson lost
whatever aura of invincibility and any remaining respect as an
athlete he had when he bit off a piece of Evander Holyfield's right
ear, then went back a short time later to snack on his left ear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once is bad enough,'' said referee Mills Lane on that night.
``But twice is dessert.''
</P>
<P>
   This time around Lane, in his role as an analyst for Fox,
happened to be sitting to my immediate left when Tyson crossed the
line again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always some damn thing with this guy,'' Lane said.
</P>
<P>
   Yes. It was January of this year, in yet another comeback fight,
when Tyson grabbed Francois Botha by the arm during a clinch and,
he later admitted, tried to break it. The first time he got into a
clinch with Norris on Saturday night, Tyson ignored Steele's
instructions to break and instead threw a punch that drew a
warning.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that the main story line of the fight was whether
Tyson could return to the brawling form of his heyday in the early
'90s and end the fight with Norris in a minimum amount of time. But
nobody in the audience could have expected a three-minute bout
would end up following one more twisted path in Tyson's
theater-of-the-absurd career.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Ratner, executive director of the Nevada State Athletic
Commission, said Norris' $800,000 share of the purse was paid, but
Tyson's $10 million cut was withheld pending a review today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The referee ruled that it was an accidental punch, and we
don't want to read any more into it until we review the films,''
Ratner said. ``But because of the circumstances, well, we just
thought it wouldn't hurt to wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Circumstances that say Tyson's career, which always has been
boxing's version of a three-ring circus, has deteriorated into a
carnival sideshow attraction to be placed alongside the bearded
lady and other freaks.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson and promoter Dan Goossen spent a good deal of time putting
the blame for the latest fiasco on Norris, the victim. They
questioned his injured knee, his head, his guts, his heart. They
said he was afraid to come back out for the second round and take
his beating.
</P>
<P>
   And while the athletic commission is investigating, it might do
well to listen to the ringside audio near Norris' corner, where
voices can be heard telling their man: ``Stay down. Don't let him
go out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The conspiracy theorists easily could concoct a scenario in
which all Norris wanted to do was get off easy for the biggest
payday of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit him in his jaw, and he hurt his leg,'' Tyson said.
``He's a coward.''
</P>
<P>
   And Iron Mike is a sociopath.
</P>
<P>
   These days in the cesspool of boxing, that's where hope floats.

ROSE GOES HEAD-FIRST INTO INFAMY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When Pete Rose's plea for reinstatement continues
to be rejected and his name is left off baseball's Hall of Fame
ballot, when he never again gets the opportunity to stand before
millions of TV viewers and at least show remorse for the betting
sins he insists he never committed, when he's never able to step
into a major-league park to be gloriously cheered by thousands of
forgiving fans who want to believe him, he can scratch that hard
head of his and continue to try to figure out how life works.
</P>
<P>
   The mentality that made him one of the century's greatest
players continues to make him one of our century's great tragic
figures.
</P>
<P>
   So he didn't want to come out and use the s-word _ sorry _ when
NBC's Jim Gray set him up Sunday night after a glorious All-Century
Team celebration in Atlanta. OK, fine.
</P>
<P>
   But as Gray persisted, Rose resisted. By then someone should
have insisted they just cut it short, because the two were just
killing the mood. And killing Pete's chances for any more sympathy.
He'd already missed a press conference earlier in the day because
of an appearance commitment at a New Jersey casino. Enough not
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Rose didn't become the Hit King by sacrificing over
runners. And to him, admitting guilt now would be sacrificing his
integrity _ whatever little of that he has left.
</P>
<P>
   _More surprising than Rose being voted onto the All-Century team
was that, further down the list of outfielders, enough fans knew
enough about Oscar Charleston to give him more votes than Joe
Medwick, Wee Willie Keeler and Goose Goslin....
</P>
<P>
   _There's absolutely no reason why if, the World Series opens on
a Saturday, it can't be a day game....
</P>
<P>
   _Team of the Decade?: The Atlanta Braves aren't even Team of the
Weekend....
</P>
<P>
   _The ultimate turkey for this gutter-ball-of-a-season offered up
by the Pac-It-In 10 conference will be when only four are left
standing when the NCAA picks its bowling teams.
</P>
<P>
   'Cause the conference has automatic reservations with five
bowls.
</P>
<P>
   After the Rose Bowl embarrassingly takes the reputed champ, then
the Holiday, Sun, Aloha and Oahu have dibs on the next four _
provided they have the prerequisite six victories.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, that's no guarantee for any of 'em getting that.
</P>
<P>
   One not-so-unlikely scenario has Stanford, 5-2 record overall
and 5-0 in the conference after tripping up USC, could lose its
last four at Washington, at Arizona State, in the annual fiasco
against Cal and playing host to Notre Dame and come up one win
short.
</P>
<P>
   Another ludicrous situation would have Stanford win the Pac-10
with a beat-up 5-3 record but then needing to defeat Notre Dame in
its last game to qualify....
</P>
<P>
   _USC, obviously looking ahead to its season finale against
Louisiana Tech, will be fortunate to finish .500....
</P>
<P>
   _Penalty on UCLA _ unnecessary display of defense....
</P>
<P>
   _Next place the Staples people are thinking about stapling their
nameplate to is the new Fenway Park....
</P>
<P>
   _Whyyyy us? Heard the new Nancy Kerrigan dance single ``Shining
Through'' yet? ``She knows she isn't Barbra Streisand,'' says hubby
Jerry Solomon. Nor are you The Idolmaker....
</P>
<P>
   _A frosted flakes cereal featuring John Elway, called
``Quarterback Crunch,'' will be distributed to the Denver area soon
and include random redemption cards for Elway memorabilia....
</P>
<P>
   _Word is that Rickey Henderson and Bobby Bonilla will sit in
with the other card-playing dogs in the next batch of ESPN
commercials.

<P>
   ``GODFORSAKEN SEA'' &QL; 
By Derek Lundy (Algonquin, $22.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The open ocean might look tranquil on any given day, but smart
sailors never forget what Herman Melville called ``the tiger heart
that pants beneath it.'' There have been many adventure-at-sea
books released over the last two years, but we hope you haven't had
your fill because this one is terrific. In Lundy's prologue, he
describes the deep fear that came to him during his first trip
across the open sea in a small sailboat, with just his wife along.
Their goal was to reach the Virgin Islands, but in his heart Lundy
knew that they would make it ``only if the ocean let us through.''
He admits that some of that fear lingers even today when he goes to
sea in a small boat, which makes the subject of his book seem
logical: the Vendee Globe round-the-world race, an astonishing
competition in which participants sail alone for 27,000 miles, more
than half of it through the most dangerous waters in the world (the
Southern Ocean), sometimes taking as long as five months to finish.
Lundy focuses on the 1996-97 race, in which 16 skippers _ 14 men
and two women _ faced severe storms and life-threatening
conditions. One disappeared altogether, and several were rescued
from the freezing water after their boats ran into trouble. The
most dramatic rescue was that of Raphael Dinelli, whose boat
capsized, then righted itself briefly before it went down (a
freezing Dinelli lashed himself to the awash deck, then jumped into
a life raft minutes before the boat sank). His only hope of rescue
from the icy water was Pete Goss, a British competitor who was
caught in the same storm 160 miles downwind. When race authorities
contacted him, Goss immediately abandoned the race and battled for
30 hours through ferocious conditions to reach Dinelli, without
even knowing if he was still alive (yes, but barely). This tale of
heroism, not to mention superb sailing, has a sweet ending: Dinelli
lived, and he and Goss became close friends. If you couldn't get
through Sebastian Junger's ``The Perfect Storm,'' try this one.
It's wonderfully written by someone who knows what it's like to be
alone in a wilderness of wind and waves. &QL;

``ETHEL &AMP; ERNEST'' &QL; 
By Raymond Briggs (Knopf, $21) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   See those people on the cover? You know them. They are Ethel and
Ernest, but you know them by other names. That's what makes this
book so enchanting. It's possible to read it in one sitting,
because it is _ don't panic, please _ a comic strip. Raymond Briggs
is a British illustrator of children's books (``The Snowman,''
``Father Christmas''). He is also the son of Ethel and Ernest
Briggs. Here he imagines his parents' lives from the moment they
first saw each other in 1928 (she was a maid, he was about to
become a milkman) to their deaths nearly 50 years later. Their
conversations over the years reflect world events, from the rise of
Adolph Hitler to the invention of television. They also reflect
things that are not so common today but that we remember in so many
people who are now gone _ modesty, simplicity, an appreciation for
what one has and a stoic acceptance of the troubles life delivers
to one's door. This is Briggs' love letter to his parents. It's not
overly sentimental, just real and wistful and true. Enjoy. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
``THE BOOK ON THE BOOKSHELF'' By Henry Petroski (Knopf, $26) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Petroski (``The Evolution of Useful Things'') is an engineer who
has carved a rather charming literary niche for himself by paying
minute attention to objects that don't seem to deserve it. Pencils.
Paper clips. Zippers. In keeping with that tradition, we read the
title of this book and thought that it might be about the physical
properties of books _ spines, paper, type. We were wrong. It's
about the physical properties of bookshelves. Think about it:
Books. Bookshelves. As subjects go, one suffers by comparison.
Petroski, however, is undeterred. He studies the function and
history of shelves because, he says, ``looking afresh at and
thinking anew about the bookshelf, like looking or thinking from
scratch about anything found or made, brings its own rewards, not
the least of which are fresh new ways of encountering and
experiencing the world.'' We preferred the view from Anne Fadiman's
delightful ``Ex Libris,'' in which the shelves are pretty but the
books get equal time. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
``DIEGO RIVERA'' &QL; 
By Pete Hamill (Abrams, $49.50) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, Pete Hamill traveled by bus from New York to Mexico
City to study art under the GI Bill. He was 21 and, he says, ``in a
daily state of exhilaration.'' He sought out the work of the great
Mexican painters and found in the canvases of Jose Clemente Orozco
and Rufino Tamayo a reason to alter his plans _ within a year, he
had lost his nerve and decided to become a writer, too overwhelmed
by the Mexican artists to paint pictures of his own. But what of
Diego Rivera, the great Mexican muralist? The young Hamill found
him to be ``clenched and stiff . . . hopelessly dated, someone out
of the 1930s.'' Thirty years later, when Hamill visited an exhibit
in Mexico City that celebrated the 100th anniversary of Rivera's
birth, his interest was reborn. For the first time, he says, he
could see what a great painter Rivera had been. This handsome and
engaging book, with photographs and reproductions of Rivera's work,
is both a biography and an analysis of the painter's art and its
effect on an entire country. ``The daughter of an industrialist and
the son of a farmer could look at the work of Diego Rivera and
recognize Mexico,'' says Hamill. ``He is like some great writers,
from Charles Dickens to William Faulkner to Gabriel Garcia Marquez:
the insistence on the value of the local leads to the universal.'' &QL;

<HEADLINE>
YANKEES ARE ROLLING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Correcting byline) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They haven't instituted the scorched earth policy that
Sherman did a few years back when his troops made an unwelcome
appearance in this historic southern hamlet, but the Yankees
continue to cause misery in these parts.
</P>
<P>
   These New York Yankees, of course, are slightly more peaceful
than the aggregation that Sherman commanded, preferring to do their
damage with their bats, arms and gloves in a non-violent approach
that has left the Atlanta Braves violently ailing.
</P>
<P>
   And that's precisely what the Yankees did Sunday evening in an
overwhelming fashion, impaling the Braves, 7-2, in a boring affair
that wasn't faintly as close as the final score suggests.
</P>
<P>
   This World Series won't be officially over until the Yankees win
four games, a total they figure to reach in the middle of the week
at Yankee Stadium if they continue to function at such a divine
level and their opponent continues to stumble and bumble haplessly.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in just two games, the Yankees have turned what was
expected to be a tight series into such an uneven competition that
the most riveting bit of drama in Game 2 came before the first
pitch was thrown and didn't even involve any of the participants.
</P>
<P>
   They should have replayed that heated nationally televised
debate between Team of the Century outfielder Pete Rose and NBC
sideline interviewer Jim Gray on the Turner Field scoreboard
because, apparently, it caused a greater reaction from viewers
around the country than did the one-sided game that was decided the
moment the reeling Braves manager, Bobby Cox, made out his lineup.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, watching Jim Gray, a mediocre Howard Cosell copycat of
limited talent, inciting Rose with hardball questions turned out to
be far grander theatre than watching Derek Jeter, Chuck Knoblauch,
Tino Martinez, Bernie Williams, Paul O'Neill, Ricky Ledee pound out
one base hit after another and David Cone retire one Brave batter
after another on the clear, 49-degree evening.
</P>
<P>
   It's just getting uglier and uglier for the Braves, who were
one-hitted across seven innings by the Cuban exile, Orlando (El
Duque) Hernandez, on Saturday night and, proving that wasn't a
fluke, came right back to be one-hitted across seven innings by
Cone.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the Braves have been consistent.
</P>
<P>
   This was a total Braves collapse, from their batters failing to
hit to their fielders failing to field to their manager reverting
to classic World Series form.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just played a bad game,'' said Bobby Cox.
</P>
<P>
   Cox also managed a bad one.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Cox might be Manager of the Year in the National League
this season and he might have done his best work in his career, but
the guy has a lengthy history of falling apart in these World
Series game dating back to 1991 when he cost his team a probably
triumph against the Minnesota Twins because of a curious loyalty to
a home-run-prone left-hander named Charlie Leibrandt.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't enough space to list all of Cox's miscalculations
during the Braves' World Series failures this decade against the
Twins, Toronto Blue Jays and Yankees, but we can add a few more to
Cox's ledger in light of the weird lineup he drew up for the second
game.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of going with the same group of doughty fellows that
overcame a serious challenge from the New York Mets, Cox decided to
go with three new starters against the Yankees for no more
compelling reason than they happen to bat from the left side of the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine, except Ozzie Guillen, who replaced the reliable
Walt Weiss at shortstop, is old and can't field any longer; Keith
Lockhart, who replaced the sure-fielding Bret Boone at second base,
makes the erratic Chuck Knoblauch look like Robbie Alomar in the
field; and Greg Myers, who replaced NCLS Most Valuable Player Eddie
Perez at catcher, isn't exactly a renowned handler of pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   All three men endured problems Sunday night, as Guillen dropped
a infield popup I could have caught, Lockhart threw a ball halfway
to Savannah, and Myers failed to coax anything meaningful out of
the Braves' starter, Kevin Millwood, who gave up eight hits and
four earned runs in just two innings.
</P>
<P>
   One idly wonders why Cox even started Millwood, a 24-year-old
right-hander who won 18 games during the regular season but doesn't
have the post-season credentials of a John Smoltz.
</P>
<P>
   Why is Cox waiting until Game 4 to pitch Smoltz, who is one of
the prime big-game pitchers in baseball?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he figures the Braves might be in an 0-3 precipice by
then, and will need Smoltz to keep his team afloat.
</P>
<P>
   I can't figure it out, but I've spent the entire 1990s trying to
figure out many of Cox's October moves.
</P>
<P>
   The loudest cheers of the night came before the game when Pete
Rose was introduced during the Team of the Century ceremony and in
the fifth inning when Guillen caught a popup off the bat of Cone
after dropping one from Cone in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not our night,'' Bobby Cox kept saying.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't look like the Braves' series, but they can take
solace in the fact that it was only three years ago that they
opened with two easy wins over the Yankees in New York _ 12-1 and
4-0 _ only for the Yankees to come back to win the next four in a
World Series streak that now has reached 10.
</P>
<P>
   But these Yankees aren't those 1996 Braves.
</P>
<P>
   These Yankees play the game the way it is supposed to be played,
and they just keep throwing pitchers out there that the Braves
simply can't solve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hitters are pressing. . .no doubt about it,'' said the
Atlanta hitting coach, Don Baylor. ``We've been trying to rally,
make something happen. And nothing is happening.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitching sets the entire tone of our team,'' said the Yankee
manager, Joe Torre. ``It just has been so good, and it's a lot
easier for us to play from ahead than from behind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not out of it,'' said Ozzie Guillen in the solemn
Atlanta dressing room. ``We've had to overcome so many things this
year, and I think we can overcome this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have about as much chance of overcoming these lordly
Yankees as Jim Gray does of being invited to Pete Rose's next
gambling bash.

 INTEL INTRODUCES SPEEDY NEW CHIP  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Intel will roll out a new generation of smaller,
faster Pentium III microprocessors today (October 25), and top PC
vendors will be on hand to show off notebook, desktop and server
computers incorporating the new chips.
</P>
<P>
   Code-named Coppermine, the new Pentium IIIs will put Intel back
in front in the PC-performance race, displacing rival Advanced
Micro Devices. For users, the new chips should mean a measurable
increase in computer speed, especially in demanding applications
like 3-D graphics.
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic improvements will come in notebook PCs,
because Coppermine chips, running at speeds of up to 500 megahertz,
will be the first Pentium IIIs suitable for use in mobile machines.
Previously, the fastest Intel chip for portables was a
400-megahertz Pentium II.
</P>
<P>
   Acer, Compaq, Dell, Gateway, HP, IBM and others are expected to
announce Coppermine-based notebook models today. Most will
introduce the new chip first in high-end models aimed at business
executives and priced at more than $3,000. But both Acer America
and Gateway will offer laptops that include the new chip for only
$1,999.
</P>
<P>
   Desktop versions of the chips will run at speeds of up to 733
megahertz, compared to the 600-megahertz maximum of current Pentium
IIIs.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the increased speed and mobility possible is a new
production process that squeezes the Pentium III's internal
circuitry down from .25 micron in width to .18 micron _ about one
five-hundredth the width of a human hair. Even though the
Coppermine chips incorporate 28 million transistors, they'll be
smaller than a 33-cent postage stamp, according to Intel.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to their higher frequencies, the new chips feature
several internal enhancements that further boost performance,
especially in demanding applications like processing 3-D graphics.
</P>
<P>
   With the appropriate memory and supporting chips, for example,
desktop systems with Coppermine chips will be able to move data
between the main processor and memory _ along the data channel
known as the ``frontside bus'' _ at 133 megahertz, compared with
100 megahertz today. In Coppermine notebook models, this channel
will run at 100 megahertz, compared with 66 megahertz today.
</P>
<P>
   The Coppermine chips will incorporate the ``Level 2 cache'' _ a
small amount of ultra-fast memory that gives the processor quick
access to frequently used data and programming instructions _
directly into the main chip, where its contents can be tapped even
more quickly. With previous Pentiums the Level 2 cache was on
separate chip, which made access slower.
</P>
<P>
   The combined effect of these and other enhancements, according
to Nathan Brookwood, principal analyst at Insight 64 in Saratoga,
will be to make the new chips roughly 10 percent faster than their
predecessors on average, assuming that the two chips were running
at the same clock speed. Because in reality the new chips will run
at higher clock speeds, the actual performance boost will be
larger.
</P>
<P>
   How much larger, however, depends on the task in question.
Dell's new Coppermine systems score between 1 and 42 percent fthan current Pentium III models in various benchmark tests,
according to a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Intel lost its traditional leadership position back in August,
when rival Advanced Micro Devices introduced its new Athlon chip,
running at 650 megahertz. Earlier this month, AMD boosted that
chip's top speed to 700 megahertz.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's lead could be short-lived, however: AMD is expected to
boost the Athlon's speed to 800 megahertz by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Over the coming months, both companies ``are just going to drive
performance to startling new heights,'' Brookwood said. ``The
people who need that kind of performance are definitely going to
notice.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the potential of the new chips won't be realized
immediately, however, because technical glitches have forced Intel
to delay release of supporting chips that were supposed to let
PC-makers combine the Coppermine chips with a new and faster memory
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Some PC companies, including IBM and Micronpc, have switched to
support chips from an Intel competitor that don't support the new
type of memory, which is known as Rambus or RDRAM. Other companies
will use other Intel chip sets, but these don't offer all the
features the delayed chips were supposed to.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many companies planning to roll out desktop PCs with
Coppermine chips, Compaq will offer a 650-megahertz Presario model
starting at an aggressive $1,129. Gateway will add the chip to its
Performance line, with prices starting at $2,099 for a model with
600-megahertz version of the chip, while Hewlett-Packard will
announce a $2,299 Pavilion model with a 733-megahertz version.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to desktop and notebook Coppermine chips, Intel also
will add versions of it in its Xeon processor family, which is
designed for use in servers and high-performance workstations.
</P>
<P>
   Insight 64 analyst Brookwood said, however, that these chips
likely will appear only in low-end servers, mainly because the new
design limits the chips' Level 2 cache to 256 kilobytes. Current
Xeon Pentium III chips have up to eight times as much cache, and
designers of large server systems generally prefer larger caches
even if they operate slightly more slowly, according to Brookwood.

 NET FIRMS SEE BIG POTENTIAL IN FOREIGN MARKETS  &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For proof of how cosmopolitan the Internet has
become, look no further than MyWeb Inc.com, which describes itself
in company handouts as being ``headquartered in San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the provider of TV-based Net access, which went public
in February, has 80 workers in China, 60 in Malaysia and eight in
Singapore. And at its global headquarters in the Financial
District?
</P>
<P>
   One employee, on hand mostly to field calls from U.S. investors.
</P>
<P>
   Such calls are becoming more frequent _ a trend that underlines
the vast potential for Internet companies seeking to open the Net
to millions of non-English-speaking users.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think about English, the portal race is pretty much
over,'' said Charlene Li, senior analyst at Forrester Research,
which tracks changes in the online world. ``You have Yahoo and AOL
duking it out. But in other countries, the portal race is just
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of this year, nearly 60 percent of the world's
Internet users will reside outside the United States, according to
International Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Microsoft unveiled a Spanish-language online
service in conjunction with Mexico's largest phone company,
Telefonos de Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest prize is China, where the number of people
online is expected to quadruple from 4 million today to more than
16 million by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, by comparison, is projected to have about 125
million Net users by the same time, nearly double the current 70
million.
</P>
<P>
   If current growth rates continue, some analysts believe that
China could surpass the United States for people online by the end
of the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The non-English world is definitely growing faster than the
English-speaking world,'' said Heather Killen, Yahoo's vice
president of international operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still no market (for total Internet users) that is
bigger than the U.S. market,'' she observed. ``But markets outside
the United States are growing faster.''
</P>
<P>
   This hasn't been lost on MyWeb, which operates search and
directory portals in China, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Singapore. Each
is accessed via a set-top box using an ordinary TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a U.S. entity,'' explained T.S. Wong, MyWeb's
28-year-old president and chief executive, ``but we have no
business operations in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the company boasts a U.S. market value of more
than $100 million, and has surged in just four months of operation
to become the eighth-most visited site in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the United States, the PC is the primary point of access,''
Wong said while on one of his monthly visits to the Bay Area. ``But
in many other countries, there are many more TVs.''
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: In China, there are only 11 million PCs and about
320 million TV sets. No wonder, then, that Microsoft's Bill Gates
was in Shenzhen earlier this year unveiling plans to bring WebTV,
the leading U.S. provider of TV-based Net access, to the mainland
by using a Chinese version of the Windows CE operating system in
set-top boxes.
</P>
<P>
   MyWeb, which launched its China service in June, is hoping to
fend off such deep-pocketed competition by moving quickly to stake
out market share.
</P>
<P>
   The company now claims more than 20,000 users in China but hopes
to have 200,000 more boxes atop Chinese TVs within the next six
months, Wong said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being nominally headquartered in the United States, Wong
hopes that MyWeb will be seen by Beijing authorities more as a
local enterprise than a foreign enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling at the moment is that our competition will come
from mainland companies,'' he said. ``Foreign companies will
attract too much attention from regulators.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, America Online is hoping this won't be the case.
The planet's biggest online service, with some 18 million users
worldwide, launched a Hong Kong service last month in what most
observers see as a beachhead for eventual expansion to the Chinese
mainland.
</P>
<P>
   AOL already has a Japanese-language service based in Tokyo,
along with an Australian version of its English-language content.
In Europe, AOL Germany this month became the company's first
non-U.S. subsidiary to top 1 million members.
</P>
<P>
   ``International growth is clearly an important opportunity for
us,'' said Jack Davies, president of AOL International. ``It is a
real important growth driver for our business.''
</P>
<P>
   If, or when, the company advances into mainland China, it will
find itself facing some new challenges. One potential obstacle is a
recent pronouncement from China's information industry minister, Wu
Jichuan, virtually barring foreign investment in Internet firms.
</P>
<P>
   Davies said an AOL China service isn't yet in the cards
``although it's an attractive long-term opportunity.'' He
characterized his company as being ``in a watching and studying
mode.''
</P>
<P>
   For AOL, as well as all other Internet concerns, the primary
worry at present is the relatively high cost of Net access in most
other nations.
</P>
<P>
   An Internet user in China may pay the equivalent of about $20
for monthly service _ no small amount where the mean annual
household income is approximately $2,500. On top of that comes
steep per-minute phone charges.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the matter of making money _ not always the highest
priority for growth-happy Net outfits. With online ad revenues even
more scarce abroad than in the United States, many Internet
companies are banking on e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, IDC is projecting that e-commerce sales will soar
from $5.6 billion last year to $430 billion by 2003. In Asia, the
total is seen ballooning from $2.7 billion to $72 billion, though
most online sales will be confined to Japan, Hong Kong and
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is tricky in China, where few people have credit
cards and delivery services aren't exactly models of reliability.
</P>
<P>
   MyWeb hopes to overcome at least the delivery side of the
equation by shipping goods _ mostly household supplies _ via taxi
cabs. Meanwhile, China.com of Hong Kong, another Internet service,
is mulling a cash-on-delivery plan for online purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're delighted that other people think e-commerce will be
difficult,'' said Ian Henry, China.com's president of international
operations. ``That's because we're working on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a spectacular initial public offering of its shares in
July, China.com is lagging its rivals. A recent survey by CNNIC,
China's official Internet domain registry, found that China.com
ranked 40th for page views, well behind rival portals like SinaNet
and Sohu.com.
</P>
<P>
   But Henry pointed out that the China.com portal is only one
piece of his company's ``pan-Asian'' strategy. There also are Hong
Kong and Taiwan portals, as well as more lucrative Web-development
operations throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   He said China.com, which collaborates with AOL for the latter's
Hong Kong service, would welcome a Chinese version of AOL to the
mainland, arguing that the two companies would target different
segments of the market. He also said China.com is pulling for
TV-based MyWeb to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to get people online,'' Henry insisted. ``We just
want eyeballs.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, getting people online doesn't necessarily
translate into increased eyeballs for all content providers. MyWeb
users, for example, see a MyWeb screen when they turn on their TVs.
If they choose not to surf the Web, they can switch immediately to
ordinary programs.
</P>
<P>
   A similar format will be used by Microsoft in launching a
Chinese version of WebTV. The software giant already serves up MSN
portals in Hong Kong and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   But when people start surfing, chances are good that many will
turn to the best-established brand on the Net: Yahoo. In the CNNIC
ranking, Yahoo was the fourth-most-visited site among Chinese
Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, Yahoo operates in 12 languages. And in a number of
nations, including Japan, it attracts more visitors than any other
site.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo's Killen is especially enthusiastic about the future of
non-PC Internet access devices. She called TV-based services ``the
next really big frontier,'' and said Yahoo is working with various
wireless communications firms for providing Net access via cell
phones.
</P>
<P>
   According to Forrester Research, a majority of Scandinavians and
Asians will be accessing the Net using cell phones within a few
short years.
</P>
<P>
   At MyWeb, such rapid changes mean that CEO Wong barely has time
to catch his breath while globe-hopping to his company's various
properties. He's projecting a 300 percent jump in revenue over the
next five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is just huge potential for opportunities,'' Wong said.
``The number of TVs sold in Asia every year is simply
mind-boggling.''
</P>
<P>
   Next up? It hasn't been lost on the folks at MyWeb that India's
population is about to exceed 1 billion. An Indian TV portal will
be launched early next year.

WEB SITE OPENS CHARITIES' BOOKS TO THE PUBLIC EYE &HT;    By BERNADETTE TANSEY
 &HT;    c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The first Web site to give the public a look at
the books of 180,000 charities was so mobbed after it went up last
week that the operators were forced to shut it down temporarily for
upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   The site, www.guidestar.org, began offering access last Monday
(October 18) to the charities' IRS Form 990s _ the nonprofit
equivalent of a tax return. Previously, these were available only
by asking for copies from the individual charities or the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   The forms show how much a charity spends on good deeds and how
much goes toward fund raising, salaries and other administrative
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Schmidt, president of Philanthropic Researc Inc., which
runs the site, said the system had registered 650,000 hits by
midday on the first day. He estimated that three times that many
people tried to log on that morning but couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday afternoon, Guidestar had to take down its site to
install a new server. When it came back up on Wednesday, however,
the 990s were no longer available, though financial summaries and
other information were. Guidestar said it started bringing the 990s
back online Thursday, but on Friday (October 22) they were still
hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   Even without the 990s, the site still provides a wealth of
information, all in one place.
</P>
<P>
   Site visitors can search for charities by name, city, state,
category, keyword and/or income.
</P>
<P>
   There's a brief description of the charity's mission, and by
clicking on ``more financial information,'' visitors can see a
summary of the 990.
</P>
<P>
   The summary shows a rough breakdown of revenues (from donations,
grants and other sources) and expenses (programs, administration
and other). By dividing program expenses by total expenses, a donor
can see what percentage of outlays go toward good works.
</P>
<P>
   While the summary is a good first step, it could distort the
charity's true financial picture, said Daniel Langan, a spokesman
for the National Charities Information Bureau, a charity watchdog
group. To see what's really going on, donors should see the full
990.
</P>
<P>
   The 990 breaks expenses down into far more categories, including
fund raising, management, rent, travel and even postage and
telephone expenses. The latter two categories might indicate
whether the charity is doing a lot of phone and mail solicitations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's $10 million in annual expenses and most of that
goes for telephones, postage and printing, then you should go ahead
and contact the charity and say, `Why is that?''' Langan said.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason to scrutinize the 990: Langan said some charities
count certain fund-raising costs as ``program'' expenses if the
solicitation included material that might be deemed educational,
such as a list of warning signs for breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   This could make the charity look like it's spending more on
programs than it really is.
</P>
<P>
   To find out if the charity is doing this, look at the 990 under
``Part II, Statement of Functional Expenses,'' which includes a
section that requires a charity to reveal how much in fund-raising
expenses were reported as outlays for programs.
</P>
<P>
   Other nuggets in the 990: Some charities are required to reveal
salaries of board members and top-paid executive staff. Cash gifts,
investments and the amounts spent on specific community projects
also may be detailed.
</P>
<P>
   The 990s at Guidestar are computer scans of the actual paper
document sent to the IRS _ some complete with smudgy handwritten
numbers and obvious wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   The 990s were provided to Guidestar by the IRS in a joint
project with Philanthropic Research and the National Center for
Charitable Statistics, with major funding from the Ford Foundation,
the W.K. Kellogg Foundation and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Guidestar does not plan to recommend individual charities,
develop performance rankings or create hard-and-fast formulas for
evaluating nonprofits.
</P>
<P>
   But Schmidt said that within six months, the site will provide
analytical tools for donors who want to use their own criteria to
evaluate nonprofits.
</P>
<P>
   Guidestar warns visitors not to place too much emphasis on the
990 numbers, and cautions that a single year's tax return is only a
snapshot of the organization's management. Schmidt said charities
must be evaluated differently according to their age, size and
mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comparing a new charity to an established one would be like
comparing Amazon.com to General Motors,'' Schmidt said. ``(A
startup) is likely to have higher fund-raising costs because it has
to build the capacity to raise money before it can spend it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Langan, of the National Charities Information Bureau,
believes there are some standards that should apply to all
nonprofits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The charity, to meet our standards, has to devote a minimum of
60 percent of annual expenses to programs,'' Langan said.
Nonprofits should not have more than one director who is paid for
serving, and that member should not be the president or the
treasurer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those standards are posted on the NCIB's Web site, www.give.org.
This site also has a good explanation of how to read a 990.
</P>
<P>
   Like most new Web sites, the Guidestar project still has some
work to do.
</P>
<P>
   Some 990s are not up-to-date. For example, the latest data
available for the San Francisco Opera Association is from 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Guidestar hopes to post current information on 220,000
nonprofits by the end of the year. It will not post financial
information on church-run charities or charities with less than
$25,000 in revenues _ neither of which are required to file 990s _
or on foundations that only make grants to other nonprofits, which
file a different IRS form.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in the nonprofit world believe that simply by making
financial records readily available, the Guidestar site will lead
to more ethical and efficient use of donor funds.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt thinks that the site could spawn a cottage industry of
philanthropic watchdog groups who use the data to recommend
charities.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Philanthropic Research say the 990 posting is the
beginning of a wave of Internet philanthropy resources that could
revolutionize charitable giving in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time, the revolution is going to be driven by
information,'' said Bill Meehan, co-chair of Philanthropic
Research.

 UCSF BIRTHS A RESEARCH CENTER AS IT AMPUTATES AN EMERGENCY ROOM  &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It is the best of times and the worst of times
for the University of California at San Francisco, which breaks
ground today (October 25) on a new research facility at Mission
Bay, even as it cuts services at Mount Zion Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an obvious symbolism in these two events,'' says Dr.
Warren Gold, president of the UCSF Faculty Association. ``The
medical-discovery side of the campus is extremely healthy, but the
medical-delivery side is sick.''
</P>
<P>
   University leaders, Gold included, are justifiably proud of
Mission Bay, which makes its ceremonial debut on San Francisco's
eastern flank.
</P>
<P>
   During the past decade, UCSF scientists have become world
leaders in medical research, an accomplishment symbolized by the
Nobel Prizes awarded to UCSF Chancellor J. Michael Bishop, UCSF
Professor Stanley Prusiner and former UCSF Professor Harold Varmus.
</P>
<P>
   The entire biotech industry traces its existence to
breakthroughs made by UCSF researchers, who were instrumental in
such milestones as the 1974 discovery that DNA from different
organisms could be spliced together.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, UCSF scientists have performed their medical miracles
while crammed into the main campus on Parnassus Heights. They need
and deserve the modern quarters planned for Mission Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The new research campus is expected to become a magnet for drug
and biotech firms, cementing Northern California's position as a
world center for the biomedical industry and giving San Francisco a
boost in the process.
</P>
<P>
   The optimism surrounding Mission Bay stands in stark contrast to
the dismal situation at Mount Zion.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital administrators are grappling with how best to shut down
Mount Zion's busy emergency room, which serves one of San
Francisco's poorest neighborhoods, just as flu season is getting
under way.
</P>
<P>
   The same aura of belt tightening and gloom hangs over the entire
UCSF Stanford Health Care system. Many doctors are taking pay cuts;
nurses are juggling more patients; support staffers are getting
pink slips. Morale, to put it mildly, is in the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   This same malaise extends far beyond the well-reported problems
arising from UCSF's merger with Stanford University. Talk to any
medical professional and they'll say our system of paying for
medical care seems ready to collapse. Patients and doctors accuse
HMOs of stinginess. Lawmakers struggle to control Medicare costs.
Yet millions of Americans still lack any insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
   So here we are, expanding UCSF's research engine even while its
emergency rooms sputter for lack of financial fuel. I put this
irony to Professor Lloyd ``Holly'' Smith Jr., associate dean of
medicine at UCSF.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us feel the main health care problem is not the cost
or the inequitable distribution, serious as these are, but the
continued existence of diseases for which we have no answers or
only halfway answers,'' Smith says.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is one of the people who made UCSF what it is today, by
recruiting some of the brightest minds in medicine and guiding them
as they transformed a once-ordinary teaching hospital into a
research giant. In a sense, the marvelous research campus that will
rise at Mission Bay springs from seeds Smith helped plant decades
ago.
</P>
<P>
   So it behooves us to listen when Smith says, ``The university
can't solve the health care problems of the nation, but we can help
find the answers to rheumatoid arthritis or schizophrenia or
AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough. But somewhere amid today's congratulations, we
ought to pause for a moment and reflect on what it says about our
society that we'll spare no expense at unraveling the secrets of
the genome but we balk at providing emergency-room care for a poor
kid with the flu.
</P>
<P>
   IPO OUTTAKES: Space considerations forced me to omit some
intersting facts from a daily article last week about the new
momentum for initial public offerings of biotech firms.
</P>
<P>
   The article made the point that biotech IPOs seemed to be on the
rise after a long dry spell. Some data provided by Burrill &AMP; Co.,
the San Francisco investment bank, would have driven home the point
even more strongly.
</P>
<P>
   During the quarter just ended, biotech firms raised a stunning
$2.25 billion in follow-on offerings _ additional stock issued by
companies that are already public.
</P>
<P>
   Looked at another way, biotech firms raised as much in follow-on
offerings last quarter as they did in all the follow-on financings
filed in 1997, 1998 and the first half of 1999 combined.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, banker Steve Burrill predicted the end of
biotech's long IPO drought on Wall Street, saying a strong market
for secondary financings usually preceded an IPO rebound. The
flurry of recent biotech IPOs could prove his point.
</P>
<P>
   BETTER THAN MOTHER'S MILK?: Some scientists believe nanny goats,
ewes and other mammals can be altered genetically so that their
milk produces protein drugs beneficial to humans. The idea would be
to harvest the milk, then extract and refine the drug of interest
to humans.
</P>
<P>
   But in a recent edition of Nature Biotechnology, Canadian
scientists at Universite Laval in Quebec reported that they
successfully had altered male mice in such a way that their semen
produced human growth hormone.
</P>
<P>
   Although they only managed to produce a minute amount of the
drug, they postulate that the system could become far more
efficient if they are able to repeat the experiment in male boars,
which can produce up to half a liter of semen at a time.
</P>
<P>
   No word, however, on how the scientists intend to routinely
harvest that ejaculate.

 TRACKING TOP FUND MANAGERS  &HT;     By HARRY DOMASH 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Let's face it. Mutual fund managers have a big
advantage over you and me. Although we get plenty of information on
the Internet, they get it better and faster because they can afford
to pay big bucks for it. They're trading hundreds of thousands of
shares every month and generating big commissions, so naturally, if
analysts have new information, they'll tell the fund manager before
us.
</P>
<P>
   So wouldn't it be great if we could find out which stocks top
fund managers are buying or selling? It turns out you can for some
funds.
</P>
<P>
   IPS Millennium Fund (www.ipsfunds.com), is listed at five stars
(highest rating) by Chicago's Morningstar, a leading mutual fund
rating service. The fund's shareholders earned 86.7 percent on
their money during the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   You can find out what the fund's manager, Robert Loest, is
buying and selling, and why he's doing it, almost on a real-time
basis on the fund's Web site. From the IPS home page, select IPS
Millennium Fund and then click Portfolio Manager Diary.
</P>
<P>
   The diary is a stream-of-consciousness log of Loest's thinking
as he makes buy-and-sell decisions throughout the trading day. It's
outstanding! The diary is up to date as of the previous trading day
and goes back one month. It appears to include Loest's thoughts
about every trade he makes for the two funds he manages _
Millennium and the newer New Frontier Fund.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, talking about two Real Estate Investment Trusts
that he sold on October 15, he said, ``I decided it was a mistake
ever getting back into them.'' Commenting on the market that same
day, he said: ``I kept hearing all day from everyone on CNBC that
Fridays are not the day to get into the market on severe declines.
. . . Well, since it seems like everyone including your cab driver
already knows this, I figured I'd better buy on Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of his comments are enlightening. For instance, when
talking about buying RFMD (RF Micro Devices) on October 8, he
explained what it made (chips for digital cell phones) and why its
stock was down that day. (It couldn't keep up with demand). You
can't get this kind of insight in paid reports, but it's free here.
</P>
<P>
   IPS also gives you the top 10 holdings for the Millennium and
New Frontier funds as of the end of the previous month (click top
10 stocks from each fund's main page), including a short
description and analysis of each top holding, and a link to each
company's Web site in case you want to research the company
further.
</P>
<P>
   FIRSTHAND TECHNOLOGY: The Firsthand Technology Value Fund sports
an average annual return of 47 percent during the past five years,
the best return of any mutual fund. Naturally, it also is listed at
five stars on Morningstar.
</P>
<P>
   You can find out what fund manager Kevin Landis has bought or
sold in recent months by going to Firsthand's site
(www.firsthandfunds.com), clicking on Value Technology Fund, then
Portfolio Data and, finally, Historical Portfolio Information.
</P>
<P>
   Firsthand's information isn't as current as IPS' data. Its
managers don't want the competition to know what they're doing, so
they keep their trades secret for at least a month. If you look in
October, you'll see the portfolio as of August 31.
</P>
<P>
   For each holding, Firsthand shows you the number of shares
owned, the price paid, the total market value of the holding, and
the percent of the fund's assets it represents. There's also a link
to each holding's Web site. Firsthand also displays the amount of
the fund's assets held in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Firsthand's Portfolio Listings page lets you compare their
funds' portfolios between any two report dates. For instance, when
I entered July 1999 for the start date and August 1999 for the end
date, Firsthand displayed the July and August holdings, and the
difference between the two portfolios in a separate column. By
looking at the difference, you can see which stocks the fund was
buying and selling.
</P>
<P>
   I could see that the Technology Value Fund dumped 300,000 shares
of Aspec, a maker of semiconductor development software, and loaded
up on Novoste, buying 668,800 shares of the
medical-equipment-maker. I also noticed that the fund increased its
cash position from 1.6 percent of assets in July to 11.9 percent in
August, an unusually large amount of cash for a growth fund,
telling me the managers were getting conservative.
</P>
<P>
   You can find the same information on the site for Firsthand's
other funds.
</P>
<P>
   MUNDER NETNET: The Munder NetNet Fund (www.mundernetnet.com),
also listed at five stars by Morningstar, specializes in Internet
related companies and returned a sizzling 171 percent during the
past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Munder's portfolio information on the site is current as of the
end of the previous month (September). Munder shows you which
stocks were bought and sold during the month (click on Buys &AMP; Sells
on the top menu) and why. It also shows a complete list of holdings
(click Holdings) along with a short description and analysis of
each stock.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot of information, considering that this fund holds
more than 90 companies. However, it doesn't show how many shares
are owned or what percentage of the total portfolio each company
represents.
</P>
<P>
   OPENFUND: OpenFund (www.openfund.com) is a brand new fund
specializing in high-tech companies. OpenFund goes a step further
than the other funds, showing its portfolio holdings in real time.
(Click Inside OpenFund on the left.)
</P>
<P>
   The display is updated every time a trade is made. The managers
also give a blow-by-blow commentary (click On the Trading Desk) of
why they're doing what they're doing. Also, if you're really bored,
you can click on their Live Trader Cam and see live shots of the
traders in action.

 ALTAVISTA GETTING $40 MILLION FACE-LIFT  &HT;     By TOM STEIN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Preparing for a possible public offering early
next year, AltaVista Co. is getting a $40 million makeover.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a page from Yahoo's playbook, AltaVista of Palo Alto,
Calif., wants to reach beyond its search engine roots and become a
Internet portal powerhouse, offering a wide range of news and
entertainment, an e-commerce platform and next-generation search
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The new site, which goes up today (October 25), will include a
new logo and customizable, continually updated content from 100
media sources, including the New York Times, the Washington Post
and the Associated Press. It also features a shopping service and a
network of some 1,000 Webcams, or online cameras, that snap
pictures from locations around the world, including the Nasdaq
trading floor.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to drive more traffic to the site and make the
company more palatable to Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're legendary for search, but not known for having a network
of services like Yahoo,'' said AltaVista chief executive Rod
Schrock. ``We are introducing the renaissance of AltaVista that
will fuel our growth and possibly put us in a position where it's
time to go public.''
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo is the No. 1 Web site in the United States, with 32
million unique visitors a month. AltaVista is in 17th place, with
9.5 million visitors, according to research firm Media Metrix in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI, which acquired 83 percent of AltaVista in June from, wants
to market it more aggressively than its previous owners, Digital
Equipment Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said AltaVista clearly is taking aim at Yahoo with its
new strategy, but they wonder if the market can support more than
one or two major Internet portal sites.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Bane, an Internet analyst with the Yankee Group research
firm in Boston, said there are already too many portals and expects
a shakeout. But, she added, ``there is still room for anyone who
can improve the consumer experience. Yahoo has the strongest brand,
but they don't have the market locked up just yet.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that one thing AltaVista has over its competitors is a
free Internet-access service that allows users to surf the Web for
free in exchange for watching banner ads. ``Free Net access could
be AltaVista's ace in the hole in this portal game,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   AltaVista said it is updating its existing free Net access
service, which has been downloaded by about 650,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The company also is spiffing up its search engine by adding an
``intuitive interface'' that lets users search across eight
dimensions, including Web pages, discussion groups, directories,
news, shopping, audio clips, photo images and video images.
</P>
<P>
   AltaVista will launch a $120 million advertising and marketing
campaign, slated to kick off on tonight's (October 25) Monday Night
Football game.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its relaunch, AltaVista will Web cast a 1 p.m.
concert today (October 25) in New York City by Grammy Award-winning
singer Lauryn Hill.

 LYCOS, ALTAVISTA TRYING TO BECOME VIRTUAL MALLS  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Lycos Inc. and AltaVista Co., two of the Web's
busiest search directories, today (October 25) will become the
latest Internet portals to join in the search for new electronic
shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos will launch LycosShop, which the Waltham, Mass., company
touts as the first to let Web shoppers compare, select and buy
goods all in one place.
</P>
<P>
   LycosShop will start with about 10,000 products from about 1,000
sellers, including big name brands like Gap, Barnes &AMP; Noble, Crate
&AMP; Barrel, Eddie Bauer, Service Merchandise and L.L. Bean.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, AltaVista will launch a new shopping comparison
service as part of a $40 million makeover that will be announced
today (October 25).
</P>
<P>
   The two, which are both partially owned by CMGI Inc., are only
the latest portals vying to become virtual malls.
</P>
<P>
   Others include Amazon.com's zShops, Intuit Inc.'s Quicken
Shopping Channel and Yahoo Inc.'s YahooShopping service.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos Executive Vice President Ron Sege said about 40 percent of
the people who use Lycos are searching already for more information
about a future purchase, so the company hopes to capitalize on that
traffic and its brand name.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are thousands of dot-com this and dot-com thats which
you've never heard of before and who you're not going to give your
credit card to,'' Sege said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Web research firm Media Metrix, Lycos was the 10th
most popular Web site, with about 13.4 million unique visitors in
September. Yahoo was first, with 32 million; AOL second, with 28.4
million; and Microsoft third, with 28.1 million. AltaVista was
17th, with 9.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   All the online shopping services let users find specific product
information such as price, color and features. But Sege said
LycosShop also offers product reviews written by professionals and
regular consumers. Also, he said, there is a computerized form that
lets shoppers rate products, such as digital cameras, based on
their own criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos' main source of revenues still will be from advertising,
but the merchants also will pay Lycos 2 percent or more from each
online sale.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos' virtual mall will start out smaller than its competitors.
Last month, Amazon's zShops started with 500,000 items listed,
which was well behind the 3.75 million items sold on YahooShopping.
</P>
<P>
   But analyst Barry Parr of International Data Corp. in Mountain
View, Calif., said LycosShop could grow more quickly because it is
a more complete Internet shopping service than Amazon's zShops,
which is trying to be more like ``the Kmart or Wal-Mart of the
Web.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is possible that Lycos may have come up with something
here,'' said Parr, IDC's director of consumer e-commerce research.
``They have really leap-frogged Amazon.com.''
</P>
<P>
   Parr said he expects other online shopping malls to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if any of these sites will make a big difference
this Christmas season,'' Parr said. But if Lycos ``can deliver on
what they've promised to do, I think it has the potential to really
help consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Sege said planning for LycosShop began after the holiday season
in 1998 and originally was going to include television home
shopping. But that was contingent on the $22 billion merger between
USA Networks and Lycos, which collapsed in May after CMGI, which
owns 20 percent of Lycos, objected. CMGI, a Boston investment firm,
eventually purchased 83 percent of Palo Alto's AltaVista for $2.3
billion.
</P>
<P>
   AltaVista will reveal more details about its new shopping
service today (October 25). Parr, who also was briefed on
AltaVista's plans, said the new site also will have a customized
shopping comparison service.
</P>
<P>
   The company's strategy is to cater to ``Web enthusiasts, the
heaviest users of AltaVista,'' Parr said. ``It's also a good
strategy, it's smart, and it's doable.''
</P>
<P>
   Parr said he is curious to see how Yahoo reacts to the
competition from Lycos and AltaVista, which both are trying to use
e-shopping to bite into Yahoo's still-sizable Web traffic lead.

 PC-MAKERS REJOICE OVER 25% RISE N WORLDWIDE SALES  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR;   &LR; Chronicle Staff Writer
</P>
<P>
   Driven by strong consumer demand all over the world and a sharp
rebound in Asia, global PC sales in the third quarter soared 25
percent over the same period last year, according to a preliminary
report from the International Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The Framingham, Mass., research company pegged worldwide
personal-computer shipments at 27.9 million units for the three
months ended September 30, up 7.1 percent from the second quarter.
The biggest year-over-year increases came from Japan (37 percent)
and the rest of the Asia-Pacific market (38 percent), which last
year were still mired in economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. PC sales were 11.7 million units, up 23.2 percent over the
same quarter last year and 7.8 percent over the second quarter. IDC
attributed the strong growth, both in Asia and in the United
States, in large part to the ``nearly free PC'' marketing model,
under which consumers are offered rebates that reduce the up-front
cost of buying a new PC to less than $500 _ or in some cases to
nothing _ in exchange for a long-term commitment to an Internet
service provider.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a relatively slow 20 percent rate of year-over-year
growth, Compaq Computer retained its No.1 ranking in global PC
sales, with shipments of 3.8 million units. In the United States,
however, Dell expanded its lead over Compaq by shipping 2.1 million
units, up 58 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
   IBM held on to the third position worldwide, but it slipped to
fifth in the United States. Hewlett-Packard held fourth place in
both rankings, while Gateway climbed from fifth to third in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Apple and Packard Bell NEC finished in a tie for the sixth and
seventh slots in the United States, according to John Brown,
director of worldwide PC-tracking research at IDC. Packard Bell NEC
and other NEC divisions together ranked fifth in worldwide
shipments.

A BRIDGE LOSES ITS INNOCENCE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Golden Gate Bridge has been violated.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Couch French Fry here (potatoes are far too healthy) was
watching the 49ers' game, which is actually good for the diet. My
chips lost their taste. Then I realized I was dipping the guac with
my cork margarita coaster.
</P>
<P>
   The medley of interceptions was interrupted for a commercial
break, and the once-virginal Golden Gate Bridge was shown with a
huge ad banner plastered onto &LR;  one of the towers. No subtle ad over
the toll plaza; this one could be read from the moon.
</P>
<P>
   It was a commercial for Nortel Networks, who gave us that fine
comercial where the old-fogey CEO stands at a teleconference and
poet-speaks the Beatles' ``Come Together,'' as handsome hardhats
and cool brothers groove in unison, having suddenly realized how
amazingly hip those corporate Sil-Val money-hoarder guys really
are.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel has managed to desecrate the Golden Gate Bridge and John
Lennon, back-to-back, no small accomplishment. Nortel is the
Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence of the ad world.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anything is sacred. It was another depressing day
watching Steve Young prowl the sideline, where he's in constant
danger of getting skulled by an errant Jeff Garcia pass.
</P>
<P>
   BUT AT LEAST Steve is the only athlete in a baseball cap on TV
these days who isn't spitting like a Rainbird sprinkler. If all the
spits we're going to see on TV during the World Series could be
collected and put into a giant fishbowl, it would be a must-see art
exhibit in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great Expectorations'' it would be called, or ``Spit
Happens,'' and it would overshadow all other art. It would render
the elephant-dung Madonna as unimportant as a painting of dogs
playing poker with a velvet Elvis.
</P>
<P>
   Young, meanwhile, continues to seek a medical person who will
bless his return to football, and he has scheduled appointments
with Dr. Strangelove and Dr. Seuss. (Note: Since I genuinely like
and admire old Steve, there will be no Dr. Kevorkian jokes here.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet, suddenly I have this terrible vision of Young 10 years from
now, standing on the sidelines at Candlestick in his baseball cap
and  &LR; with his clipboard, and the TV guy is saying that Steve is
talking about returning to action soon, yet Young is unaware that
the 49ers have long since moved to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe what Steve is doing with that clipboard is making
police-artist sketches of the guys who have been mugging him for
years.
</P>
<P>
   I'll refrain from giving Young advice, but as my friend Dr.
Feelgood says, ``This city doesn't need another half-witted
lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   AT LEAST STEVE knows when to keep his mouth shut. On the
telecast of Saturday's Stanford-USC game, as the Trojans were
jumping to a 21-0 lead, announcer Keith Jackson said, whoa Nellie,
``There won't be enough room on the scoreboard for USC today!''
</P>
<P>
   There was, however, enough room in Jackson's mouth for his foot,
as Stanford won 35-31.
</P>
<P>
   Big day for Stanford. For the musically reclined, the Stanford
Lurching Band soundly defeated the USC Starching Band, and that
battle o' the bands was like an Al Gore-Jesse Ventura debate.
</P>
<P>
   SPEAKING OF TROJANS, USA Today made a slight mistake. It ran a
cute story about how the Cliff House in San Francisco, in its
guest-room mini-bar refrigerators, stocks condoms, or ``intimacy
kits.''
</P>
<P>
   Close. It's actually the Clift Hotel that provides this amenity.
</P>
<P>
   Gives me the shivers just to think about it. To each his own,
but I know if I was searching for such intimate apparel while
hotel-guesting, I sure wouldn't get it from a mini bar.
</P>
<P>
   MEANWHILE, if New Year's Eve in S.F. is going to be a
cataclysmic bust-out, and it will be, first the city has to survive
Halloween in the Castro. Word I get is that the
last-Halloween-of-the-century theme has the lads in the 'hood
already reaching levels of enthusiasm above and beyond the normal
crazed call of Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   So if you haven't shopped yet, don't even  &LR; try &LR;  to go out and
find a Rev. Jerry Falwell mask.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of holidays, is it too early to leap into the
Christmas spirit? Not for those plucky S.F. Firefighters, who have
already launched their holiday Toy Program. Last year, the program
got off to a late start due to budget cuts, but Chief Demmons
wasn't going to let that happen again. The program is fully-staffed
and smokin'.
</P>
<P>
   MEANWHILE, BACK to the 49ers, losers of three in a row.
Remember, men, when you're in a skid, turn your steering wheel in
the direction of the skid, so you can see what you're crashing
into.
</P>
<P>
   I learned that at the excellent Jim Russell School of Highway
Survival at Sears Point, where they teach you how to control wild
skids, handle emergency braking situations and do high-speed,
tire-smoking slaloming. In short, the basic tools you need to find
a parking space in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   As for the 49ers, give coach Steve Mariucci credit for this: He
is resisting Young's pleas to get back into action. Yet relations
are not strained between the coach and the QB. It was cute when, as
the game was winding down yesterday, Young dumped the Gatorade tub
on Mariucci's head.

ANALYSIS: DAVIS' TRIP TO EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST MIXES TRADE, 
 POLITICS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By ROBERT COLLIER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  Gov. Gray Davis and a select group of his top campaign donors
are testing the economic value of red-carpet diplomacy.
<P>
   Davis' two-week trade mission through Europe and the Middle East
concludes Friday, but the real results probably won't be clear
until long afterward, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Will lasting business contacts have been created in the
countries Davis visited, greasing the wheels for lucrative deals
for California? Or will the pomp and circumstance fade into
nothing?
</P>
<P>
   Political sniping has already started, with critics saying the
trade mission is merely political payback to donors among his
delegation, such as supermarket magnate Ron Burkle.
</P>
<P>
   Backers reply that the trip, as well as Davis' high-profile
diplomacy earlier this year with Mexico, demonstrates a new
assertiveness by California government on the world stage.
</P>
<P>
   The trip took Davis last week from London to Ireland and
Scotland, where he met with heads of state and corporate leaders,
saying, ``I'm here to make the case for California. ... I'm here to
sell it.'' He arrives in Greece Monday and will visit Israel and
Egypt later in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of Davis' political enemies say they don't mind an
ulterior motive or two as long as he brings home the bacon. And
they are quick to admit that there's nothing new in foreign
junketeering _ Davis' predecessors did the same, as do other
states' governors.
</P>
<P>
   But some veterans of state economic policy say Davis seems to be
so focused on the larger diplomacy that he may be slighting the
dry, unglamorous detail work that makes the deals happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The high-level vision is certainly there, but exactly how you
implement it is going to require a lot more thought and effort than
appears to have happened 'til now,'' said Sean Randolph, president
of the Bay Area Economic Forum, a San Francisco-based alliance of
corporations and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   Current indications and past experience suggest that the trip's
measurable results will be meager _ at least in the short term:
</P>
<P>
   -- Domestic politics. Most members of the delegation
accompanying Davis (aside from his own aides) represent large firms
and institutions that do no foreign trade and are not likely to,
either _ nursing homes, insurance and real estate firms, lobbyists,
business associations, labor unions. Most were major donors to
Davis' 1998 campaign for governor.
</P>
<P>
   -- Leaderless trade offices. Upon taking office, Davis followed
his predecessors' practice of firing most of the directors of
California's nine foreign trade offices. But five offices still
remain without directors, including London, where Davis spent four
days last week. These offices carry out the day-to-day work of
helping California firms make foreign deals, and experts say they
can't do their job without proper staffing.
</P>
<P>
   -- Mexico follow-up. Despite Davis' diplomatic overtures to
Mexico earlier this year, in which he and Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo exchanged official visits, California officials now admit
that no new  &LR; significant trade deals or new policy initiatives have
resulted.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Imprecise Barometer
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Mexico trips show how a trade mission's success is
hard to calculate.
</P>
<P>
   By all indications, the Mexico initiative was a diplomatic coup.
It reversed years of hostility caused by Governor Pete Wilson's
hard-line stand on immigration, opening up opportunities for
cooperation between California and Mexico on issues ranging from
trade to pollution cleanup to the education of migrant workers'
children.
</P>
<P>
   But after the trips, little was done on any issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mexico trips were symbolic and diplomatic, to start a new
era, but let's not pretend that they were trade trips,'' said
Carlos Valderrama, president of the Foreign Trade Association of
Southern California, who held several top posts in the state Trade
and Commerce Agency under Governors George Deukmejian and Pete
Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Valderrama said that Davis' decision to fire the Mexico office
director, and his subsequent failure to replace him, has prevented
the state from taking economic advantage of the new goodwill.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the delays, Davis is pushing full speed ahead with
further diplomatic expansion. He is planning to open new offices in
Shanghai, Sao Paolo, Buenos Aires, Singapore, Manila and a
still-undetermined site in India, to complement existing offices in
Frankfurt, London, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Mexico City, Seoul, Taipei,
Johannesburg and Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion will boost the state's foreign-office budget by 35
percent to $6.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't find any private company where the CEO comes in and
fires every head of overseas posts,'' Valderrama said. ``Everyone
knows there's a transition when a new governor comes in. But in the
past 10 months, there's been no transition at all. It's a vacuum.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Davis' travel agenda has been chock full. In London,
for example, he lobbied Prime Minister Tony Blair to buy Boeing
cargo planes made in Long Beach for the Royal Air Force _ with no
immediate response. He also opened a state technology trade fair,
and he cut the ribbon at a new California trade office building in
London.
</P>
<P>
   The trade fair, Cal-IT Europe 1999, an annual event that was
started by Wilson, is one of many such fairs organized by the Trade
and Commerce Agency in countries around the world to hawk
California wares. The shows help firms make contacts with foreign
buyers and investors, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say this sort of humdrum, nonpartisan bureaucratic work
_ more so than glitzy diplomacy by politicians _ is what helps
trade happen year after year.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Payoff Possible
</P>
<P>
   Have patience, state officials reply, Davis' foreign headlines
will pay off eventually.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely important for the governor to be out there
touting our products,'' said Lon Hatamiya, secretary of the Trade
and Commerce Agency, who is accompanying Davis on the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't take any market for granted _ high tech, aerospace,
environmental technology. The governor can open doors that wouldn't
be possible without him. California is looked at as a world leader,
and the governor symbolizes that.''
</P>
<P>
   The exposure could help burnish a statesman's image for Davis,
something he would need if he aspires to national office. Before
the trip, Davis had never visited Europe _ a lack of travel
experience similar to that of Deukmejian, who did not even have a
passport before he went to Tokyo in 1987 to open the state's first
overseas office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Foreign trips are very helpful to a politician who wants to
seek higher office,'' said Sean Walsh, Wilson's longtime spokesman,
who traveled abroad frequently with the governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You log the footage away in your video vault and put the
articles in your clip file, and pull them out later to justify your
national stature.''
</P>
<P>
   But Walsh warned against being overly critical of Davis. ``If
Davis reaps personal political benefits, so be it. That's one of
the advantages of being governor. (Foreign trips) help the
California economy, so good politics is good policy, and vice
versa.''

BRAIN MAY NEED GRAVITY TO DEVELOP, BIOLOGISTS WARN PROMOTERS
OF  SPACE COLONIES
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Colonizing space, let alone raising children out there,
could be a lot trickier than you imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists revealed study results Sunday suggesting that
children born in space might suffer permanent nervous-system damage
unless exposed to earthlike gravity at key points during their
early development.
</P>
<P>
   This means the youngsters could have trouble walking on Earth
because their nervous systems have never been exposed to gravity
and, instead, their neurons would be permanently wired for the
low-gravity world of space.
</P>
<P>
   Even adults might have difficulty readjusting fully to life on
Earth after prolonged periods of weightlessness, experts said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The latest word on ``the brain in space'' set a futuristic tone
for the opening of the weeklong annual meeting of the Society for
Neuroscience here.
</P>
<P>
   While some 20,000 participants spent most of the day hearing
about neurodegenerative diseases and the inner workings of the
mind, top space biologists held forth in a corner of the sprawling
Miami Beach Convention Center, conjuring up half-serious
speculations of far-out infants and pregnant women being spun
around in centrifuges to make sure they receive the proper daily
dose of G's.
</P>
<P>
   But experts said the space studies also may shed some important
light on more down-to-earth concerns _ including the largely
unexplored details of how gravity shapes life as we know it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a unique laboratory here to look at fundamental
biology,'' said David Liskowsky, head scientist in a program for
gravitational biology at the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Liskowsky said one novel set of findings _ showing a pervasive
effect of gravity on cell metabolism, brain development and DNA
synthesis _ is particularly intriguing. However, he also emphasized
that the findings are very preliminary and by no means threaten any
planned missions, including the International Space Station now
being built.
</P>
<P>
   Women are already forbidden to head into orbit if they are
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we are not ready to have children born in space,''
he said. ``This is pretty much new territory here.''
</P>
<P>
   The most surprising results yesterday were drawn from studies of
18 pregnant mice launched into space carrying some 200 mouse
fetuses at varying stages of development. The as-yet-unpublished
study was outlined for reporters by Richard Nowakowski of the
Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Nowakowski detected faint but distinct signals that nerve cells
_ and possibly every cell in our bodies _ may need gravity cues to
grow and function properly. The brain cells he examined were
thought to have no particular link to gravity-related functions.
Yet profound changes were noted when the space fetuses were
compared with carefully matched counterparts on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Cell death, a normal aspect of development, slowed down in
space, as did cell proliferation. Tiny structures that have to move
about within the cells and that normally travel ``with the cellular
equivalent speed of a Ferrari'' slowed to a crawl, Nowakowski said.
</P>
<P>
   Without gravity to guide migration of nerve cells that form the
outer layer of the cortex, the space-grown brains wound up smaller,
and although they appeared to be normal otherwise, they turned out
to have fewer nerve cells than normal mouse brains.
</P>
<P>
   Just what functional importance this would have in an adult
animal awaits further study. But it appears as if the brain
struggled to adapt as it developed, only to mask what could be
deleterious changes, Nowakowski said, ``the way a fresh coat of
paint can cover up serious structural problems'' in a house.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the muscle wasting observed in astronauts may be
indirectly linked to such deep-seated cellular effects of
microgravity, although a more likely possibility is that mere lack
of use is to blame. In any case, loss of muscle strength in space
so far has been proved to be temporary, and there are no confirmed
reports of any long-term illness in people returning from long
periods in space.
</P>
<P>
   Another study, presented by neuroscientist Kerry Walton of the
New York University School of Medicine and Dr. Robert Kalb of Yale
University, showed abnormal branching of motor neurons in the
spinal cords of young rats that had been in orbit. These branches,
called dendrites, form the connections that allow the brain to
direct movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if you took the dendritic tree and just stripped away
all the branches,'' Kalb said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these abnormalities may be permanent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Animals, like astronauts, showed a remarkable ability to adapt
to the rigors of weightlessness. But when they got back to Earth,
laboratory rats reared in space could not figure out how to walk
properly, even after four months of trial and error. Walton's
studies also showed gravity is needed for newborn pups, which are
born blind, to learn how to hold themselves upright.
</P>
<P>
   Some other findings seemed to confirm that adult subjects _
including human astronauts _ can fairly easily recover balance and
navigational abilities that have been lost in space.
</P>
<P>
   But Charles Fuller of the University of California at Davis
discovered that microgravity had a surprising, if temporary,
slowing effect on the internal ``body clock'' that keeps all
mammalian life in synch with the 24-hour day. Just how gravity
could somehow touch upon this innate ``circadian rhythm,'' in
addition to the obvious effect of light-and-dark cycles and sleep
patterns, remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility, Fuller said, is that the same sort of
fundamental metabolic changes observed by Nowakowski could be at
work.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike changes in temperature or the length of the day, changes
in gravity have never been a factor in evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows what could happen in the next millennium. So far,
however, ``we have not built the compensatory mechanisms'' to
handle zero or low gravity, Fuller said.

<P>
   The publishing world has offended Barbara Bush's family so much
this month, it's almost enough to make her regret her whole
literacy campaign.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush the elder was still reeling from ``Dutch,'' in which
Edmund Morris implied that the Bushes weren't on the coziest terms
with the Reagans, when his son learned about ``Fortunate Son:
George W. Bush and The Making of American President.'' The author,
J.H. Hatfield, alleges that Governor Bush was arrested for cocaine
possession in 1972. But amid reports that Hatfield served five
years in prison for hiring a hit man, St. Martin's Press last week
withdrew the book.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush has called ``Fortunate Son,'' ostensibly based
upon him, ``science fiction.'' Edmund Morris has acknowledged that
his book ``Dutch,'' occasionally based on the Reagan White House,
is partly fiction, while the Bushes have said that some of the
non-fiction parts are fiction. ``Primary Colors,'' sometimes based
on the Clinton White House, actually is fiction.
</P>
<P>
   These books all play fast and loose with the truth, as
politicians tend to do.
</P>
<P>
   It's odd to see George Sr. and Junior feeling slandered; one
expects gossip-happy authors to latch on to more accessible
political dynasties, like the Kennedys, with their fast-lane life
styles and tremendous charisma.
</P>
<P>
   It was the late John F. Kennedy Jr. who attempted with his
magazine George to create a bridge between the glamor of politics
and the gloss of print, to take the dreams of his father's
``Profiles in Courage'' and T.H. White's ``The Making of the
President, 1960'' into a crass, celebrity-obsessed culture.
</P>
<P>
   He was right. Politics and publishing have a lot in common. Both
thrive on promises and on sound bites. Both inspire personalities
to reinvent themselves, exaggerate their credits and lie about
their pasts. And both allow for folks to drum up large sums of
money in advance without disclosing too many details about the
project at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps if politicians were more forthcoming, they would be
smeared less. The American people can be very forgiving. They might
even forgive candidates for trying drugs, if given the chance. But
candidates typically won't risk it.
</P>
<P>
   Take Bill Clinton, who insisted he never inhaled. This premise
is certainly possible, knowing his desire to please all of the
people all of the time: He appeared to puff, to placate his smoking
buddies, yet knew he wanted to enter politics and say he'd never
done drugs. So he simply held the joint to his lips, in a perfect
moment of bipartisan pandering and poignant self-denial.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Bush will specify only what he has ``not'' done _
that is, not used an illegal drug in the past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that denial and self-denial at the highest levels
bring the unauthorized biographers out of the woodwork. St.
Martin's pulled ``Fortunate Son'' off shelves on the ground that if
Hatfield were a convicted felon that would undermine his
credibility _ as if authoring such works as an unauthorized
``X-Files'' encyclopedia lent him much credibility in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   The everyday lies expected in politics can loom larger when they
are under oath or inside the pages of a book. By offering books of
half-truths, publishing offers a moral mirror of politics. But
politics offers the distinct evils of sinning and lying about it.
In publishing, lying can be a crime in itself, since it can
constitute libel.
</P>
<P>
   If Hatfield invented the cocaine charge, that's a serious crime.
But if he's merely a convicted felon who hired a hit man, that
doesn't preclude him from being a successful writer. Indeed, St.
Martin's Press underestimates the forgiveness of the American
people. People might not mind a former convict writing a book as
long as the book is really good. The literati are especially
forgiving, as shown by Norman Mailer's fondness for ``Belly of the
Beast,'' written by the murderer Jack Henry Abbott. And three of
the world's greatest novels were written in prison; John Bunyan,
Cervantes and Dostoyevsky all did time.
</P>
<P>
   The American dream expressed in both politics and literature is
the dream of rebirth and redemption, the notion that anyone can
reform and move on: Former drug users can have political careers;
former felons like Hatfield can write non-fiction works with 54
pages of source notes. The public can forgive almost anything.
</P>
<P>
   Anything, that is, except a bad book.

   Scientists Find Enzyme Linked to Alzheimer's
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have known for years that to forestall or treat
Alzheimer's disease they needed to prevent hard balls of debris
from accumulating in the brain. Now researchers at Amgen have taken
the first step toward that goal. They found an elusive enzyme that
snips a brain protein in two, initiating the formation of the
debris. The next challenge, experts say, is to find a drug that
will block that enzyme. If the scientific theory is correct, such a
drug might halt the death of brain cells in people with the disease
and even prevent the disease in people destined to get it.
</P>
<P>
   A Drop in Gun Violence
</P>
<P>
   A seven percent drop in homicides last year was entirely
attributable to a decrease in killings committed with guns,
according to a report released by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation. The decline appears to be the clearest evidence yet
that recent efforts to reduce gun violence through new laws and
police pressure are working. There was also a 10 percent drop in
robberies carried out with guns, accounting for the biggest
decrease of any one category of crime.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth W. Starr Resigns
</P>
<P>
   After overseeing the five-year, nearly $50 million investigation
that led to the impeachment of President Clinton, Whitewater
independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr resigned. He was replaced by
Robert W. Ray, a 39-year-old career federal prosecutor who vowed to
complete the inquiry of Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton ``in a
prompt, reasonable and cost-effective manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr said his resignation had been prompted by the ``intense
politicization'' of his office's work. White House aides have
already portrayed Ray as an ideologue. Starr rushed to his
successor's defense, saying the criticism should be met with
``sharp and immediate condemnation.''
</P>
<P>
   Exile Denied
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Papon's efforts to flee justice didn't last long. The
89-year-old former civil servant convicted last year of helping to
send hundreds of French Jews to Nazi death camps was supposed to
start serving his 10-year-sentence on Wednesday. Instead, he issued
a defiant statement saying his only honorable choice was to flee
France and go into exile. Papon was a fugitive for only a few hours
before Swiss police caught up with him in a Gstaad hotel on
Thursday night. Swiss officials handed him back to the French and
he was in jail by Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The Money Game Widens
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and top Republican lawmakers agreed
to overhaul America's financial system, repealing Depression-era
laws that have restricted the banking, securities and insurance
industries from expanding into one another's businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The deal paves the way for banking conglomerates to offer
consumer services like brokerage accounts and auto and casualty
insurance. It will enable other financial conglomerates to provide
public stock offerings to their corporate clients but loans as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Indicting McDonnell Douglas
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury indicted McDonnell Douglas _ a unit of
Boeing, _ and a state-owned aerospace company in China on charges
of conspiring to hide important details of a 1994 sale of American
machining equipment. The equipment was intended for a McDonnell
Douglas airliner project in China, but six of the machines were
diverted to a Chinese military plant, although they were never put
to use. The companies denied any wrongdoing and vowed to contest
the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists Unite
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists normally help people who are depressed, but now,
as a result of the rise of managed care, some are feeling so
depressed they have taken an unexpected action _ they joined a
union. The New York State Psychological Association and its 3,200
members affiliated with the American Federation of Teachers. Their
hope is the million-member teachers' union will use its lobbying
clout in Albany and Washington to gain psychologists a better deal
from HMOs on reimbursements and other matters.
</P>
<P>
   A Faulty Antidote
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon may have moved closer to solving the mystery of
``gulf war syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   A report it commissioned said an experimental drug given to some
250,000 American troops sent to the Persian Gulf may be linked to
chronic symptoms afflicting thousands of veterans, including
fatigue, muscle pain, memory loss and sleep disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials tried to dampen expectations about the drug,
pyridostigmine bromide, saying more study was needed. But it was
the first time the Pentagon acknowledged a possible cause after
years of ruling out others, including gas attacks.
</P>
<P>
   One Less Candidate
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole pulled out of the presidential race _ before she
had even officially announced her candidacy and long before a
single ballot had been cast. She said she couldn't raise enough
money to compete with the financial fortunes raised by Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas or inherited by Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, money is not the only way to grease a campaign. Mrs. Dole
failed to capitalize on her strengths. She boasted of an
``historic'' campaign as a woman but sent a mixed and uncertain
message about what that meant. She missed several opportunities to
build support. After making a splashy gun-control announcement in
front of a pro-gun crowd in New Hampshire, she did not follow
through. After coming in a strong third in the Iowa straw poll, she
vanished from public view.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign Reform Loses
</P>
<P>
   The Senate played its accustomed role in the struggle to
overhaul the campaign finance law: for the fourth consecutive year
Republicans used a filibuster to kill the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The action left the effort to ban large dollar donations to the
political parties in limbo: test votes showed it had a majority of
53 senators behind it, though not the 7 more votes needed to break
the filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican who has put the battle
against special interest money at the center of his presidential
run vowed the issue will not die. But Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.,
swore the legislation will not live.
</P>
<P>
   And the money chase for 2000 went ever on.
</P>
<P>
   Teen Worries, Up and Down
</P>
<P>
   Being an American teen-ager today seems both scarier and safer
than a few years ago, according to a new nationwide poll of more
than 1,000 teen-agers by The New York Times and CBS News. The
survey found that more than half believed that their school could
conceivably be struck by the kind of massacre that devastated
Columbine High School in Colorado. But in their more immediate,
everyday lives, teen-agers reported feeling safer: Only 24 percent
said they feared becoming a crime victim, compared to 40 percent in
1994, and concern about violence was generally down.

fatigue, muscle pain, memory loss and sleep disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials tried to dampen expectations about the drug,
pyridostigmine bromide, saying more study was needed. But it was
the first time the Pentagon acknowledged a possible cause after
years of ruling out others, including gas attacks.
</P>
<P>
   One Less Candidate
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole pulled out of the presidential race _ before she
had even officially announced her candidacy and long before a
single ballot had been cast. She said she couldn't raise enough
money to compete with the financial fortunes raised by Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas or inherited by Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, money is not the only way to grease a campaign. Mrs. Dole
failed to capitalize on her strengths. She boasted of an
``historic'' campaign as a woman but sent a mixed and uncertain
message about what that meant. She missed several opportunities to
build support. After making a splashy gun-control announcement in
front of a pro-gun crowd in New Hampshire, she did not follow
through. After coming in a strong third in the Iowa straw poll, she
vanished from public view.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign Reform Loses
</P>
<P>
   The Senate played its accustomed role in the struggle to
overhaul the campaign finance law: for the fourth consecutive year
Republicans used a filibuster to kill the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The action left the effort to ban large dollar donations to the
political parties in limbo: test votes showed it had a majority of
53 senators behind it, though not the 7 more votes needed to break
the filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican who has put the battle
against special interest money at the center of his presidential
run vowed the issue will not die. But Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.,
swore the legislation will not live.
</P>
<P>
   And the money chase for 2000 went ever on.
</P>
<P>
   Teen Worries, Up and Down
</P>
<P>
   Being an American teen-ager today seems both scarier and safer
than a few years ago, according to a new nationwide poll of more
than 1,000 teen-agers by The New York Times and CBS News. The
survey found that more than half believed that their school could
conceivably be struck by the kind of massacre that devastated
Columbine High School in Colorado. But in their more immediate,
everyday lives, teen-agers reported feeling safer: Only 24 percent
said they feared becoming a crime victim, compared to 40 percent in
1994, and concern about violence was generally down.

PLAYING IT SAFE SURE CAN BE RISKY

<P>
   Travelers do it in the wake of a terrorist attack when they
decide to drive to Florida for vacation rather than get on a plane.
Diners do it when they forego a sandwich at lunch and then load up
on iced tea and fat-free cookies in the mid-afternoon. And Bobby
Valentine, the manager of New York Mets, did it during the sixth
game of the National League Championship Series, perhaps costing
his team a chance to advance to the World Series that began last
night.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the misunderstanding of cumulative risk. People avoid a
big, obvious risk and instead chose a path that involves many
smaller risks, which taken together tend to be far more
detrimental. In our mathematically illiterate society, the problem
is epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   The baseball diamond, particularly during these tense games of
October, offers one of the more accessible examples: the overuse of
the intentional walk.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneered in 1896 by the captain of the New York Giants, William
(Kid) Gleason, it is a standard tool for managers who do not want
to pitch to an especially fearsome hitter. With one or two runners
already on base, the manager orders his pitcher to throw four
deliberate balls to the dangerous batter and instead face the next,
less imposing hitter.
</P>
<P>
   That's just what Valentine did in the 11th inning of Tuesday
night's game versus the Atlanta Braves, loading the bases to pitch
to Andruw Jones rather than face Brian Jordan with runners on first
and third base. But as Valentine soon found out, the strategy can
do more harm than good _ as a few back-of-the-envelope calculations
demonstrate.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the score was tied 9-9, and a single run for the
Braves would end the game and the Mets' season with it. By filling
the bases, Valentine left his pitcher no wiggle room. Not only
would a base hit or sacrifice fly give the Braves their 10th run,
but so would an unintentional walk. Sure enough, the Mets' pitcher,
Kenny Rogers, threw four balls to Jones. Game over.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was clearly a threat worthy of concern. Versus
left-handed pitchers this year, like Rogers, he hit .331, compared
with Jones' average against lefties of only .271, according to the
Elias Sports Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, isn't the relevant comparison. Instead, one
should look at Jones' on-base percentage, the frequency with which
he gets a hit  &UR; or &LR;  a walk. It was .356 versus lefties,
significantly higher than Jordan's batting average. Remember,
Jordan needed to connect, not walk, to drive in the winning run.
</P>
<P>
   None of this even gets at the emotional aspect of Rogers' having
to pitch with no margin for error, when he was more likely to throw
an easily hittable pitch, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine that poor pitcher,'' said Carl N. Morris, the chairman
of Harvard University's statistics department and a longtime
baseball fan. ``He's got to put the ball over the plate in the
biggest game of his career.''
</P>
<P>
   In fairness to Valentine, his decision was hardly an unusual
one, particularly because it created the possibility for a
force-out at any base as well.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, fans are very likely to see similar strategies again
this week in the World Series. Under their manager, Bobby Cox, the
Braves issued more intentional walks than any other team in the
National League this year. In game five against the Mets, in fact,
Cox intentionally walked the bases loaded and then watched his
relief pitcher walk in the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   The intentional walk often looks even worse when used earlier in
a game, when a high-scoring inning is more important to avoid than
a single run. At that point, the walk gives the batters a free
base-runner, who can become a free run.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier playoff series against the Boston Red Sox, Mike
Hargrove, the manager of the Cleveland Indians (who has since been
fired), had the shortstop Nomar Garciaparra walked to load the
bases in the third inning. The Indians were leading, 5-3, at the
time. The next batter promptly hit a grand slam, putting the Red
Sox ahead, 7-5, in a game they went on to win.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, do people who are paid to make smart baseball
decisions often err here?
</P>
<P>
   There is actually a nice theory to explain it, Morris said. In
1982, Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, then professors at Stanford
University, wrote that people often assess ``the probability of an
event by the ease with which instances or occurrences can be
brought to mind.'' They called this the principle of
``availability.''
</P>
<P>
   Managers envision a slugger crushing a home run before they
adequately consider a bases-loaded walk.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, tourists worry about an apocalyptic plane crash, not
the far more likely fatal highway accident. Homeowners spend
hundreds of dollars on a burglar alarm when simply getting rid of a
gun they own would make their families much safer. And dieters
these days eschew food with fat in it _ fat they can envision
ending up on their midsections _ for low-fat foods that in fact
pack more calories that eventually will turn into body fat.
</P>
<P>
   Such ``innumerate'' decisions, to borrow a word popularized by
John Allen Paulos, a math professor at Temple University, have
clear consequences. Thousands of people really do die on the
highways and from accidental gunshot wounds. The United States,
despite years of obsessing over weight, is more obese than ever.
And, though the stakes are of course far lower, pitchers do
sometimes walk in the winning run.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, criticizing a single decision at the end of one of
the most exciting playoff games in history may be a bit harsh.
After all, Valentine ordered an extraordinary five intentional
walks during the previous game, Steve Hirdt of the Elias Sports
Bureau noted. No runs scored after any of them.
</P>
<P>
   But the larger point stands: Even if intentional walks eliminate
a short-term problem, on average they may create more long-term
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   That is cumulative risk. It's a concept worth pondering for
anyone who travels, eats or will be managing this week in the World
Series.

   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone _ The camp for amputees lies on a hill in
the most scenic stretch of Freetown, a favorite spot for British
vacationers before war destroyed Sierra Leone. The palms dotting
the surrounding hills, the nearby wide white beach, the faded
resorts promising respite, all stand in contrast to life inside the
camp: a one-legged girl hopping along one of the labyrinthine
walkways; a young man with one arm sitting on the porch of his
tarpaulin tent-house; an older man with arms hacked off below the
elbows; yet another with very short stumps.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the amputees in this camp _ there were 516 when
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright paid a visit Monday _ were
mutilated by rebels who advanced on Freetown last January. Many
were taken to the city's main public hospital where they languished
for days; then many went to a refugee camp at the national stadium
where they languished for weeks. Eventually they arrived at this
camp, which is run by Doctors Without Borders.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of another international relief organization,
Handicap International, the amputees are learning to use
prosthetics with surviving muscles, to wash themselves, to raise a
spoon to their lips. Some tasks the armless might never master,
though, like buttoning a shirt or tying a knot. But there is more
here than grinding work to relearn the basics. Isatu, a 13-year-old
girl with no arms, plays with her younger sister and friends on the
beach, touching them with her stumps, digging into the sand. A
46-year-old man, who in July said he would never wear unsightly
artificial arms with metal hooks, now takes a pen from a visitor
with his prosthetic and proudly writes down his name on a
reporter's notepad: Lamine Jusu Jarka. In a country where less than
a third of the people can write, isn't it a shame that Jarka's
handwriting is now barely legible? It will improve, he vows.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the government has done almost nothing for the amputees.
A few months ago, rumors swept the camp that the government had
gotten German surgeons to come here, and that transplants were
being performed in Europe. They became angry at the government when
the Germans never came.
</P>
<P>
   If the current peace agreement between the government and the
rebels hold _ hopes were raised Friday by a United Nations decision
to send 6.000 peacekeepers _ what will happen to the amputees? Will
the government take care of the thousands who are estimated to have
lost limbs to machetes? Even if the will exists, what can the
government do in a nation that is regarded as the world's poorest
and where everything must be rebuilt? The question is complicated
by the peace agreement, which granted amnesty to all combatants.
Foday Sankoh, the head of the rebellion responsible for most of the
war's atrocities, acknowledged his group's guilt months ago.
Recently, though, he has been backpedaling. Atrocities? Not me. He
appears more interested in the commission on mineral resources that
he will head. He has never visited this camp.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the amputees might have to rely on the system that
the vast majority of ordinary Africans rely on: the extended
family. In the world's poorest continent, relatives help one
another out; sometimes a sole member supports a large number of
relatives or close friends. If someone lucky enough to have a job
loses it, 15 people suffer, the saying goes. Here in the camp, most
amputees live with their families, secure in the knowledge that
they will never be abandoned. A few of them, however, have lost all
their families. No one knows what will happen to them.

VICTORIA WOULD NOT BE AMAZED BY CHILE TODAY

(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review)

 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ Chileans like to call themselves the English
of Latin America, referring to their reserved social etiquette and
taste for afternoon tea, proper high-cut clothes and Tudor
architecture. Probing even deeper into the national psyche, Chilean
intellectuals identify national traits that hark back to another
English century entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call us Latin Victorians,'' said Raquel Olea, a prominent
literary critic. But with a difference: ``The Chilean is totally
without anguish about his hypocrisy.''
</P>
<P>
   Victorians? Well, there is a strong similarity. Like the
outwardly proper classes in Britain a century ago, Chileans put on
a strait-laced front behind which all sorts of naughtiness go
undiscussed. But at the same time, as Ms. Olea points out, the
Protestant Victorians in Britain were guilt-ridden while the
overwhelmingly Catholic Chileans go to church, confess and leave
relieved.
</P>
<P>
   Consider how Chileans deal with and, in some cases, avoid
dealing with such difficult and morally charged matters as divorce,
abortion and teen-age pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Chile is the last country in Latin America where divorce is
still illegal, even though the rich and middle class can easily get
annulments through well-connected lawyers who know which judges
will oblige and which will not. Most couples who break up do not
bother seeking annulment at all, since it is expensive and usually
requires lying in court. They simply separate and then match up
with new, common-law partners.
</P>
<P>
   The practice helps explain why almost half of the couples who
live together in this overwhelmingly Catholic country are not
married and almost half of the children born here are born out of
wedlock.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the matter of abortion. Due to a 1989 decree by
Gen. Augusto Pinochet just before he left power, Chile is one of
only four countries _ El Salvador, Malta and Andorra are the others
_ that prohibit the procedure under any conditions, even in cases
involving rape or the life of the mother. A handful of women go to
jail every year after they are caught recuperating in hospitals
from the effects of botched abortions. Still, clandestine abortions
are so common that health experts estimate that the abortion rate
in Chile is among the highest in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to stop the clandestine abortions, conservatives
in the Senate proposed a law last year to increase the length of
jail terms for doctors, midwives and others convicted of performing
abortions. The conservatives lost by a single vote, and promise to
fight on.
</P>
<P>
   Pregnant teen-agers are legally forbidden to seek abortions, of
course, and are given few other options. Moralistic high school
principals force many to quit their studies, at least until they
give birth, and girls who are showing are asked not to attend
graduation. In just one of many double standards, young fathers
study on and graduate without sanction. And sex education is almost
nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public discourse is one thing, and the way people live is
another,'' said Mariana Aylwin, a former Christian Democratic
congresswoman and senior official in the Education Ministry. ``Our
social elite is very conservative, but I don't know a city in the
world with more motels and infidelity. This is a very hypocritical
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfredo Jocelyn-Holt Letelier, an historian at the Santiago de
Chile University, calls double standards ``the Chilean solution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Chile is traditional, but it is not an orthodox conservative
country,'' he added. ``It is a morally flexible country. If there
is a gay person in the family you accept it without ever talking
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Victorian-like values also creep into the realm of public
expression. More than 50 films and 700 videos have been banned by
government censors in recent years, usually for their sexual
content or criticism of traditional religious practices. Martin
Scorsese's 1988 film ``The Last Temptation of Christ,'' for
instance, could not be shown legally here until 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Historians and social commentators say Chilean morality has many
roots, one of which is Chile's isolation; the separation from the
rest of the world by deserts, an ocean and Andean peaks, analysts
say, has slowed the spread of new social trends. Another reason is
the lasting Spanish colonial heritage, which gives the military and
the Catholic Church unquestioned authority. Still another is the
lasting shadow of the dictatorship of Pinochet, particularly in the
areas of abortion and reduced public support for family planning.
</P>
<P>
   Others point to the conservatism of the media _ including two
Church-dominated television channels, one run by the Catholic
University and another by the conservative Catholic organization
Opus Dei.
</P>
<P>
   The church is a powerful institution in virtually every Latin
American country, but it fills a unique political space in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the church in neighboring Argentina, which supported the
military juntas of the 1970s despite violations of human rights,
the Church here was one of the few institutions to raise a public
voice against the excesses of the Pinochet dictatorship. The
liberal political role the Church played in the 1970s and 1980s,
paradoxically, now gives the Catholic hierarchy added weight in
defending many of the moral positions previously promoted by the
very military dictatorship it opposed.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Chile is tradition-bound, social change is brewing.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress recently gave illegitimate children full legal
rights and struck down a law that made male homosexual intercourse
illegal. Two years ago the Chamber of Deputies passed a divorce law
similar to Spain's _ allowing divorce after a two-year separation.
But conservatives and church leaders have so far been able to block
enactment in the more conservative Senate.
</P>
<P>
   A nascent gay rights movement is beginning to make an impact,
and is even receiving government financial support to combat the
spread of AIDS. Just this month, seven transvestites protested
police brutality before the Supreme Court building and received a
surprising amount of media attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been changes but it is much too slow,'' said
Soledad Larrain, a 50-year-old psychologist at the University of
Chile who has been living in a common-law marriage the last several
years, after having her first marriage annulled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have two children and a grandchild and I have effectively
been married two times,'' Ms. Larrain said. ``But according to this
society, I'm considered to have been single all my life. It's
totally absurd.''

VICTORIA WOULD NOT BE AMAZED BY CHILE TODAY

   SANTIAGO, Chile _ Chileans like to call themselves the English
of Latin America, referring to their reserved social etiquette and
taste for afternoon tea, proper high-cut clothes and Tudor
architecture. Probing even deeper into the national psyche, Chilean
intellectuals identify national traits that hark back to another
English century entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call us Latin Victorians,'' said Raquel Olea, a prominent
literary critic. But with a difference: ``The Chilean is totally
without anguish about his hypocrisy.''
</P>
<P>
   Victorians? Well, there is a strong similarity. Like the
outwardly proper classes in Britain a century ago, Chileans put on
a strait-laced front behind which all sorts of naughtiness go
undiscussed. But at the same time, as Ms. Olea points out, the
Protestant Victorians in Britain were guilt-ridden while the
overwhelmingly Catholic Chileans go to church, confess and leave
relieved.
</P>
<P>
   Consider how Chileans deal with and, in some cases, avoid
dealing with such difficult and morally charged matters as divorce,
abortion and teen-age pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Chile is the last country in Latin America where divorce is
still illegal, even though the rich and middle class can easily get
annulments through well-connected lawyers who know which judges
will oblige and which will not. Most couples who break up do not
bother seeking annulment at all, since it is expensive and usually
requires lying in court. They simply separate and then match up
with new, common-law partners.
</P>
<P>
   The practice helps explain why almost half of the couples who
live together in this overwhelmingly Catholic country are not
married and almost half of the children born here are born out of
wedlock.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the matter of abortion. Due to a 1989 decree by
Gen. Augusto Pinochet just before he left power, Chile is one of
only four countries _ El Salvador, Malta and Andorra are the others
_ that prohibit the procedure under any conditions, even in cases
involving rape or the life of the mother. A handful of women go to
jail every year after they are caught recuperating in hospitals
from the effects of botched abortions. Still, clandestine abortions
are so common that health experts estimate that the abortion rate
in Chile is among the highest in Latin America.
</P>

jail terms for doctors, midwives and others convicted of performing

SECULAR RULES: IN INDONESIA, ISLAMIC POLITICS DOESN'T MEAN
RELIGION 
</HEADLINE>

   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ It doesn't take a theologian to describe
the political role of Islam here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are Muslims, but when we vote, we put Islam to one side,''
said Hasan Bisri, a 60-year-old fisherman, as he waited to cast his
ballot in a general election last June. ``In Indonesia we put the
nation first and our religion second.''
</P>
<P>
   This may sound odd to many Americans, who for 20 years have
looked at Iran as the model for Islamic rule and are therefore wary
of the prospect of Islamic clerics taking power anywhere. Last
week, Indonesia's legislature elected Abdurrahman Wahid, a frail
Muslim cleric as president, and so it is fair to ask just what the
relationship of religion and politics is here. Indonesia is, after
all, the world's most populous Muslim nation.
</P>
<P>
   For most of Indonesia, Hasan, the fisherman, got it right.
Indonesians are quick to tell you that they form a determinedly
secular nation _ and that this is no anomaly. Islam, they say, is a
tolerant faith; the xenophobia and radicalism associated with it in
Iran, Afghanistan and parts of North Africa are, in their minds,
more Middle Eastern in origin than Islamic.
</P>
<P>
   Though close to 90 percent of Indonesia's 200 million people
describe themselves as Muslims, this will be the first time in
modern times that they will be governed by a religious leader.
</P>
<P>
   None of the dozen Muslim parties that contested the June
election e _ which selected the National Assembly that chose Wahid
_ called for an Islamic state. And even among these, Wahid's
philosophy is considered the most moderate and inclusive, so much
so that he may have more political trouble from other Muslim
parties than from secular nationalists and military leaders, who
also support him.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid, 59, is the chairman of Nahdlatul Ulama, a moderate
Islamic society that claims to have 30 million members. But his
power base is far broader. His backers included an old-guard
political party, at least part of the parliamentary bloc of the
military, and the bloc of Islamic parties. Once elected, he brought
the nation's secular nationalists under his big tent by choosing
their leader, Megawati Sukarnoputri, as his vice president.
</P>
<P>
   M R. Wahid, who is popularly known by his nickname Gus Dur, ``is
the most tolerant and the most nationalistic among the Muslim
leaders and the one most trusted amongst the minorities,'' said a
prominent political scientist, Jusuf Wanandi, a member of the
ethnic Chinese minority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Therefore if we are going to have a Muslim leader, it's good
that we have this guy to see how it is going to play out,'' Wanandi
said. ``This might as well be the time to try it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another ethnic Chinese political analyst, Arief Budiman, said:
``He is the hero of some Christians here. As a matter of fact, some
Muslim leaders are suspicious that Gus Dur is an agent of the
Christians.''
</P>
<P>
   The optimism about Wahid's presidency, among many people here,
extends to one of the most potentially destabilizing issues he will
face: an Islamic separatist rebellion in the northern Sumatran
province of Aceh.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Indonesia has for the most part responded to to the
rebellion in habitual style: through military repression. Wahid has
said he supports a degree of power sharing between the central
government and the provinces. Since he is a respected Muslim
leader, analysts here say, he might have a chance of reaching an
accommodation with the people of Aceh.
</P>
<P>
   In a paradox that goes to the heart of the character of Wahid as
well as of Indonesian Islam, it is the Islamic political parties
that could pose the most troublesome challenge to the new
president. They consider him too moderate, too liberal, too
tolerant of other religions and other ways of thought, too
determined to separate religion from politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using religious politics is a dangerous tendency,'' Wahid once
said. ``Let the government govern and let the religious groups take
care of their own affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   But most analysts here are optimistic that Wahid's inclusiveness
is broad enough to embrace these theological antagonists as well.
Their chances for political influence were far weaker during the
32-year tenure of President Suharto, who worked hard to minimize
the political clout of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   The differences between Wahid's branch of Islam and that of more
politically assertive groups has led to tensions, sharp words and
even small-scale violence in the past. But their differences are
only a matter of degree.
</P>
<P>
   All subscribe to Indonesia's basic philosophy of inclusion,
called Pancasila, that requires all citizens to claim a belief in
God but allows them to choose equally among five religions: Islam,
Catholicism, Protestantism, Hinduism and Buddhism. Atheism is not
permitted.
</P>
<P>
   In that context, Indonesia offers the Muslim world a model quite
different from that of Middle Eastern regimes and one that is
epitomized by Wahid's inclusive liberalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very charmed by him because he can talk about civil
society and liberation theology and he himself is a democrat and he
loves classical music,'' said Olle Tornquist, a Scandinavian
scholar who studies Asian societies. ``He is the kind of Muslim
that we in the West would all like to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Nasir Tamara, deputy publisher of an Islamic newspaper,
Republika, covered the return from Paris to Iran of Ayatollah
Khomeini in 1979 and now, 20 years later, the election of Wahid. He
said the two events have nothing in common. There is no revolution
here, he said; nothing fundamental will change.
</P>
<P>
   He called the tolerant Indonesian model ``the largest social
experiment in Islamic history'' and ``the most important
interpretation of Islam in the 20th century.'' At least in terms of
sheer size, there is no arguing with him. More people claim Islam
as their religion in Indonesia than in the entire Middle East.

A CYBERSPAT MAKES HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(jt) 
 By KATIE HAFNER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   This month marks the 30th anniversary of the Arpanet, the
Internet's predecessor. Then again, maybe it doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   The University of California at Los Angeles was ground zero for
the Arpanet. Then again, maybe it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   This anniversary of the Internet has been a particularly
contentious one. Vice President Al Gore's misstatement to CNN last
spring that he ``took the initiative'' in inventing the whole thing
was roundly ridiculed by anyone with an inkling of the network's
true origins. But in recent months, several more genuine contenders
have stepped forward to stake a claim to this or that invaluable
piece of the invention, giving rise to a number of public spats.
</P>
<P>
   As barbs fly and longstanding friendships disintegrate, figuring
out just who did what when is more difficult than ever.
</P>
<P>
   I know about this problem at close range. In 1993, when I began
researching a history of the Arpanet, the story seemed a relatively
straightforward one. I scoffed when one of the Net's many fathers
said to me one day: ``Why are you even trying to write a history?
No matter what you write, it won't be the real story.''
</P>
<P>
   While that may be true of history in general, anyone who tries
to write the real story of the Internet right now will encounter a
welter of contradictory material. Now graying, the scientists who
took part in building the Net are busier than they ever were, not
inventing new technologies but telling their side of the story to
reporters, putting up time lines and history pages on their Web
sites and shooting off e-mail messages. The goal, of course, is not
to get rich but to secure a spot in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're witnessing is a case of history getting revised in
real time,'' said Peter J. Denning, a computer science professor at
George Mason University who took part in the development of the
Internet but has remained a largely silent observer. ``We are
watching the process of myth-making as it happens around us.
Eventually certain people will emerge out of the myth and lots of
what's been accomplished will be ascribed to them, even if they
didn't do it personally.''
</P>
<P>
   The revision of history while the principal participants are
still alive is not new. The author Stephen E. Ambrose said he
grappled with the phenomenon recently when writing about the

   ``You should see how those people fought each other,'' he said.
``They would write letters to The Railroad Journal, or Horace

</P>
<P>
   To try to sort it out for himself, Ambrose relied on a
well-established body of literature. His advantage was not having
to fend off calls from Leland Stanford's p.r. agency. Nevertheless,
he found no consensus. ``I threw up my hands,'' Ambrose said.
``Don't ask me who first thought of it. I could give you a lot of
entries into the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Brinkley, a professor of history at Columbia University,
says it's a common problem. ``History is constantly being revised
in informal ways, in popular culture and in private
conversations,'' he said. ``There are always many different
versions.''
</P>
<P>
   What's new, Brinkley said, isn't the revisionism as much as the
presence of the Internet as a revisionist's tool, providing an easy
way to spread one's own version of events. The latter-day
equivalent of fighting it out in letters to the editor is to spam
the world with your take, using the Internet as an amplifier.
Whoever is fastest with the send button, whoever has the lengthier
``cc'' list, is most likely to rise above the din.

<P>
   Scholars are wondering if the Internet will make the process of
historical inquiry more difficult. ``The word definitiveness comes
to mind,'' said Neil M. Postman, a professor of communications at
New York University. ``Print is more definitive. Books preserve
information. The Internet moves information. So with information on
the move, appearing and disappearing, and without gate-keepers, it
diminishes the credibility of claims.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only do electronic versions of events have a way of drifting
more quickly and easily into the public's consciousness, but they
underscore how quickly other information can disappear from the
record.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the continuing paternity battle over the
Internet, Denning pointed to 1989, a more subdued time in the Net's
evolution, when a symposium commemorating the 20th anniversary of
the Arpanet took place at UCLA. Back then, the Net was still
relatively obscure and there was nothing much at stake. In
attendance were the very men slugging it out today. A transcript of
the event has them lavishing one another with praise and credit.
But that transcript exists not on the Internet but on paper tucked
away in the archive of the Charles Babbage Institute of Computer
History in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever remaining solidarity there might be among the Net's
founding fathers is increasing strained. There is one contingent
that stands by early September, when the network got its first
node, as the birth date of the Arpanet. Others continue to claim it
was late October, when the first electronic bits passed from UCLA
to a computer at the Stanford Research Institute, about 300 miles
to the north. Some profess to have invented packet-switching, the
data transmission technology that made it all possible. Still
others claim to have had the idea for a network in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Brinkley does not believe the Internet will hamper
historians' ability to gather facts. ``I don't think the Internet
has reinvented history,'' he said. ``It's just expanding and
complicating it a bit. History is always contested, and over time
frivolous claims get discounted, and more serious claims get more
attention, and eventually there's a consensus around a particular
answer. You won't have the open-ended disputes that are going on
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Time may also slow the rush for recognition. Every so often, the
Internet is not glorified but blamed _ for inflation, for the slump
in dot-com stocks, for widening the gap between haves and
have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the true dark side comes along, you won't see people
scrambling to take credit for that part,'' Denning said. ``It will
be, `That's not the part I had anything to do with.'''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they'll say that was Al Gore's part.

A CYBERSPAT MAKES HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(jt) 
 By KATIE HAFNER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   This month marks the 30th anniversary of the Arpanet, the
Internet's predecessor. Then again, maybe it doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   The University of California at Los Angeles was ground zero for
the Arpanet. Then again, maybe it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   This anniversary of the Internet has been a particularly
contentious one. Vice President Al Gore's misstatement to CNN last
spring that he ``took the initiative'' in inventing the whole thing
was roundly ridiculed by anyone with an inkling of the network's
true origins. But in recent months, several more genuine contenders
have stepped forward to stake a claim to this or that invaluable
piece of the invention, giving rise to a number of public spats.
</P>
<P>
   As barbs fly and longstanding friendships disintegrate, figuring
out just who did what when is more difficult than ever.
</P>
<P>
   I know about this problem at close range. In 1993, when I began
researching a history of the Arpanet, the story seemed a relatively
straightforward one. I scoffed when one of the Net's many fathers
said to me one day: ``Why are you even trying to write a history?
No matter what you write, it won't be the real story.''
</P>
<P>
   While that may be true of history in general, anyone who tries
to write the real story of the Internet right now will encounter a
welter of contradictory material. Now graying, the scientists who
took part in building the Net are busier than they ever were, not
inventing new technologies but telling their side of the story to
reporters, putting up time lines and history pages on their Web
sites and shooting off e-mail messages. The goal, of course, is not
to get rich but to secure a spot in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're witnessing is a case of history getting revised in
real time,'' said Peter J. Denning, a computer science professor at
George Mason University who took part in the development of the
Internet but has remained a largely silent observer. ``We are
watching the process of myth-making as it happens around us.
Eventually certain people will emerge out of the myth and lots of
what's been accomplished will be ascribed to them, even if they
didn't do it personally.''
</P>
<P>
   The revision of history while the principal participants are
still alive is not new. The author Stephen E. Ambrose said he
grappled with the phenomenon recently when writing about the
construction of the transcontinental railroad 130 years ago, an
immense project in which dozens of luminaries like Sen. Thomas Hart
Benton and the industrialist Leland Stanford had a hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should see how those people fought each other,'' he said.
``They would write letters to The Railroad Journal, or Horace
Greeley's paper, saying, `I'm the one who first suggested it's
possible to build a railroad across the country.'''

MARTHA STEWART VS. THE WWF: THE FINAL CONFIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review)

 By GEORGE JOHNSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   The news from Wall Street last week drew attention to probably
the most startling contrast imaginable in American popular culture:
Martha Stewart and the World Wrestling Federation, both going
public to investors on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   Stock buyers were clearly more enamored with the mistress of
domesticity than with the minders of Stone Cold Steve Austin and
The Rock. She reportedly became a billionaire overnight, at least
on paper.
</P>
<P>
   But on the other hand, Ms. Stewart and the WWF have a lot in
common, if you take a warped look at quotations from the current
issues of her magazine, Martha Stewart Living, and the wrestling
federation's two magazines, WWF Magazine and WWF RAW.
</P>
<P>
   Excerpts follow.
</P>
<P>
   Furniture Alterations  &QL; 
 &QL; 
Martha: Inevitably you have more guests than dining-room chairs. So
you drag a couple of chairs in from another room, but they are a
different style. To unify this motley collection, make a matching
set of chair-back covers.  &QL; 
The WWF: At the 1999 Royal Rumble, Mick Foley was blasted 12 times
by a chair swung by The Rock. A few weeks later, the Road Dogg
drilled Al Snow four times, swinging a chair on ``Raw.'' ...
Unprotected chair shots are metallic reservations for the
``Alzheimer's Hilton'' and competitors in this business try to
avoid them at all costs.  &QL; 
Aromas!  &QL; 
Martha: You can follow your nose the 15 miles between the two
shops; the irresistible smell of cinnamon sugar and hot biscuits
pulls you from one to the other.  &QL; 
The WWF: Nothing rejuvenates pure evil like the putrid smell of his
victims' blood.  &QL; 
A Love of the Wild &QL; 
 &QL; 
Martha: Do you know? Some species of cactus _ prickly pears _ grow
wild on well-drained, sunny sites as far east as Florida and
Massachusetts, and up into Canada.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
The WWF: As Boss Man left the dressing room, Snow leaped onto him
from a platform _ blasting him with a steel chair and dragging him
into the dressing room, where Boss Man battered Snow with a case
containing his dog, Pepper, and hit him with a blackboard. Snow
rammed his rival's head into a glass case and a garage door, and
the pair continued their fracas onto the street.
</P>
<P>
   They soon wound up fighting at an outdoor cafe and in a downtown
Minneapolis bar ... Snow borrowed a chain from a customer to use as
a weapon, delivered a moonsault from the bar, hit the Boss Man with
a billiard ball and scored the pin on a pool table after smashing
the former corrections officer with his own nightstick.  &QL; 
Sandwiches  &QL; 
 &QL; 
Martha: Open-face sandwiches are layered with roasted vegetables,
ham, turkey and Swiss, then heated until the cheese melts. They are
served with homemade dill pickles and sweet-potato wedges.  &QL; 
The WWF: A ``Rock sandwich'' doesn't consist of meat or tuna fish
but instead several fresh slices of smoked ``shut your mouth'' and
some honey-baked ``smackdown.'' There's no cheese _ The Rock
doesn't like cheese! Rolls  &QL; 
Martha: Today, with time in short supply, fresh-baked dinner rolls
are a particular treat. While they take a little more effort, rolls
are no harder to bake than bread. They are, of course, nothing more
than bread dough that has been formed, usually by being rolled in
the palms, into smaller, individual portions. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The WWF: D'Lo countered with the Real Deal, a tilt-a-whirl slam and
legdrop. When he tried somersaulting onto his rival, though,
Jarrett rolled out of the way. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Decorating  &QL; 
Martha: Ask the children to help decorate (the Thanksgiving table).
They can place felt finger puppets atop candy sticks for a sweet
yet simple centerpiece; older kids can cut and glue paper shapes
for a Mayflower centerpiece and help arrange plates and cutlery.  &QL; 
The WWF: ``As fans of body art,'' the wrestler Prince Albert says,
``of course we're concerned about maintaining a clean and safe
environment when we pierce and tattoo. We wouldn't want someone's
nipple or tongue to get infected and turn green!''  &QL; 
Women Getting Together  &QL; 
Martha: I think I tasted some of Sara's food at a party in New
York, asked to meet her, and persuaded her, and her friend Jane
Stacey, a baker, to come and work for me in Connecticut as chefs in
my growing catering business ... They immediately made the parties
I catered even more special.  &QL; 
The WWF: Smarting from a recent attack by the champion, Tori came
into the ring with fists swinging, debilitating her rival with
series of suplexes. After bouncing off the ropes, Ivory slid under
her foe's legs, drove her face into the mat and executed a giant
swing.
</P>
<P>
   Tori tackled her opponent, spun her upside down and hoisted her
over her shoulders. When Tori tried a sunset flip, however, Ivory
shifted her weight and fell on top of the contender for the
victory.
</P>
<P>
   To add to the humiliation, Ivory tried ripping off Tori's outfit
after the bell. Suddenly Luna _ absent from the Federation for
months _ stampeded into the ring and chased the Women's Champion
back to the dressing room.  &QL; 
Cravings  &QL; 
 &QL; 
Martha: In some families, [Thanksgiving is) largely about stuffing.
After the first helping, the guests all wait for their fullness to
subside so they can have more.  &QL; 
The WWF: Gangrell has a hunger, a thirst, an appetite for control
over and complete domination of others. Within him is an innate
drive to lead a tribe of men he can manipulate _ bend to his will.
 &QL; 
Bluster  &QL; 
Martha: Even people who cherish the blustery winds of winter agree
that they are best left outdoors where nature intended.  &QL; 
The WWF: You call yourself a fan? Well, son, if you're not a member
of the Squared Circle Club, you're just a piece of trash!

THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT A CANDIDATE IN UNIFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(jt) 
 By FRANK BRUNI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although Al Gore has been on the national political
stage for decades, there is much that many voters still do not know
about him, and he has recently been drawing attention to one of
those blind spots: his military service in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   In campaign advertisements that began airing last week, Gore
highlighted that service. And for an article in the current issue
of Talk magazine, Gore gave hours of interviews on his decision to
go to war.
</P>
<P>
   These portraits seem designed to flesh out a man often seen as
wooden and perhaps to distinguish him from other presidential
candidates _ most notably, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who has
long faced questions about whether his family pulled strings so he
could spend the Vietnam years as a pilot in the Texas Air National
Guard in Houston. But they raise a question, especially in the
context of the Oval Office's current occupant: Are voters impressed
much by a politician's military record or lack of one?
</P>
<P>
   Historians and political analysts said there is no simple
answer, but that in general a military record holds less sway than
before. These experts cited a variety of reasons, beginning with
the fact that more than half a century since the end of World War
II, serving in the military is more the exception than the rule for
most Americans, and is not expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see plenty of candidates for the House and Senate, and they
all gives us a resume, and it may say National Guard duty,'' said
Stuart Rothenberg, editor of the Rothenberg Political Report, a
nonpartisan newsletter that interviews and evaluates candidates.
``But most of the time, the candidates are crowing as to what
church they go to or whether they're in the Rotary.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican who is arguably Bush's chief rival for the
party's presidential nomination, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, was a
prisoner of war in Vietnam. But that aura of heroism has perhaps
paled next to the famous surname and tens of millions of dollars in
campaign contributions that have helped propel Bush into the lead.
And Bush _ who has said he is not aware of any favoritism leading
to his noncombat Vietnam experience _ does not seem particularly
worried about voters homing in on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in 1992 gave Bill Clinton something of a pass for
avoiding Vietnam, just as voters have given passes to many
Republican and Democratic members of Congress who also found ways
out of that conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Although a letter to a draft board that showed Clinton worried
about his ``political viability'' contributed to his critics'
dismissal of him as ``slick Willie,'' it did not sink him at the
polls. In the primaries, he beat Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska,
who won the Medal of Honor in Vietnam. In the election, Clinton
beat President George Bush, a decorated World War II veteran, as
well as Ross Perot. In 1996, Clinton trounced a decorated World War
II veteran, Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   There remain prominent politicians whose military backgrounds
undeniably burnished their credentials and smoothed their ascents
to office, among them Sens. McCain, Kerrey, Max Cleland, D-Ga., and
Chuck Hagel, R-Okla. But historians and political analysts noted
that those men were decorated heroes, and the political plus of
that special status does not mean that it is a political minus to
have no record of military service at all.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Greenstein, a presidential historian at Princeton
University, said that voters' reaction to a candidate's military
background depends on the type and details of the service. The
political historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. added, ``It depends
on the war.'' In the case of Vietnam, the conflict most relevant
for the largest number of politicians today, Americans' ambiguity
toward the war translates into a willingness to forgive men who
avoided it.
</P>
<P>
   David Doak, a Democratic strategist in Washington, said that
when he worked on the recent campaign of Gov. Gray Davis of
California, polling and focus groups suggested that Davis earned
points when voters learned of his service in Vietnam. But that same
research showed that he stood to lose points if he cited an
opponent's avoidance of service, Doak said.
</P>
<P>
   That dynamic suggests that Gore must be careful in how he
presents his own military history, which is not one of dramatic
combat. Rather, he was an Army journalist, an attractive assignment
that has attracted its own scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   But if Gore plays it right, it could soften Gore's somewhat
stiff profile and also peg him in some voters' minds as a moderate,
Doak said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think military service helps Democrats in particular,'' he
said. Rightly or wrongly, he said, ``It sends a signal that they're
not run-of-the-mill ultra-liberals.''  &QL;

THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT A CANDIDATE IN UNIFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(jt) 
 By FRANK BRUNI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although Al Gore has been on the national political
stage for decades, there is much that many voters still do not know
about him, and he has recently been drawing attention to one of
those blind spots: his military service in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   In campaign advertisements that began airing last week, Gore
highlighted that service. And for an article in the current issue
of Talk magazine, Gore gave hours of interviews on his decision to
go to war.
</P>
<P>
   These portraits seem designed to flesh out a man often seen as
wooden and perhaps to distinguish him from other presidential
candidates _ most notably, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who has
long faced questions about whether his family pulled strings so he
could spend the Vietnam years as a pilot in the Texas Air National
Guard in Houston. But they raise a question, especially in the
context of the Oval Office's current occupant: Are voters impressed
much by a politician's military record or lack of one?
</P>
<P>
   Historians and political analysts said there is no simple
answer, but that in general a military record holds less sway than
before. These experts cited a variety of reasons, beginning with
the fact that more than half a century since the end of World War
II, serving in the military is more the exception than the rule for
most Americans, and is not expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see plenty of candidates for the House and Senate, and they
all gives us a resume, and it may say National Guard duty,'' said
Stuart Rothenberg, editor of the Rothenberg Political Report, a
nonpartisan newsletter that interviews and evaluates candidates.
``But most of the time, the candidates are crowing as to what
church they go to or whether they're in the Rotary.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican who is arguably Bush's chief rival for the
party's presidential nomination, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, was a
prisoner of war in Vietnam. But that aura of heroism has perhaps
paled next to the famous surname and tens of millions of dollars in
campaign contributions that have helped propel Bush into the lead.
And Bush _ who has said he is not aware of any favoritism leading
to his noncombat Vietnam experience _ does not seem particularly
worried about voters homing in on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in 1992 gave Bill Clinton something of a pass for
avoiding Vietnam, just as voters have given passes to many
Republican and Democratic members of Congress who also found ways
out of that conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Although a letter to a draft board that showed Clinton worried
about his ``political viability'' contributed to his critics'
dismissal of him as ``slick Willie,'' it did not sink him at the
polls. In the primaries, he beat Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska,
who won the Medal of Honor in Vietnam. In the election, Clinton

well as Ross Perot. In 1996, Clinton trounced a decorated World War

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Campaign funding reform charade ends for another
year
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just as predictably as the diva keeling over in the last act of
the opera, political campaign funding reform has died its annual
death in Congress, this year the victim of a coup de grace by the
Senate's Republican leadership. Which, of course, did not allow the
straight up or down vote on the issue that it had once said it
would permit.
</P>
<P>
   Reform had passed in the House, and a Senate majority apparently
stood at the ready, but it takes 60 votes to spike a filibuster and
Majority Leader Trent Lott kept enough in his pocket to prevent
that.
</P>
<P>
   I say ``apparently'' because it is in no way clear that either
of the majorities was real. Confidence that Lott would queer the
deal let some disinclined Republicans in the House log a pretty
pro-reform vote, suitable for re-election framing, without much
risk reform would really happen.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it sure that the Democrats, beating the drum for reform
these days, are the converts to it they say they are. Democratic
majorities dodged opportunities to enact reforms earlier in the
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry for the cynicism, but the real game seems to be to give
members a chance to vote for reform every now and again, if they
want to for the record, safe in the knowledge that each roll call
is just a set-up.
</P>
<P>
   (I'm reminded of a hustle in the Georgia Legislature some years
back. The House would vote to ban nude dancing in Atlanta, but the
issue would die in the Senate. The next year they'd switch roles.
That way, every legislator got to vote, by God, against nekkid
dancing, without ever endangering it. One year, the chambers
accidentally voted for the ban together. It took a panicked
procedural scramble to keep the ladies in chill bumps.)
</P>
<P>
   Most members of Congress realize big money has deeply corrupted
politics. Even so, most have optioned themselves and their parties
to rich commercial interests, if they have not simply sold
themselves outright. We don't have elections any more. We have
auctions.
</P>
<P>
   Reform opponents have even come up with a euphemism for the
bidding: free speech. You can't limit political contributions
because dollars, they say, are speech. If this means _ and it does
_ that the banks or the oil companies or the insurance industry get
millions of votes to your one, well, that's democracy for you.
</P>
<P>
   No, it isn't. Our founders were political realists, but they'd
gag on that one.
</P>
<P>
   Some members are even honestly rather than just rhetorically
offended by the money grubbing, but every one of them was elected
by the current system, and both parties depend on it, and all of
them are terrified of the unknown.
</P>
<P>
   So Democratic President Bill Clinton turns the Lincoln bedroom
into Motel 6 for moguls, and House Majority Whip Tom DeLay huddles
weekly with trade association representatives and other lobbyists
and sucks so much money out of them for the GOP that he's known as
``DeLay, Inc.''
</P>
<P>
   Our franchise has been bought out from under us and it will stay
bought unless a fed-up electorate demands its return.

   TOKYO _ The Nissan Motor Co. could well serve as a metaphor for
postwar Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years ago, David Halberstam held up Nissan in ``The
Reckoning'' as a shining example of Japanese economic prowess in
marked contrast to American ineptitude. But in the last decade
Nissan has mirrored all that is wrong with this country .
</P>
<P>
   Staggering under Himalayan sized debts, an arthritic bureaucracy
and bloated inventories of boring cars, it reflects a Japan
burdened by massive public liabilities, an aging population, an
ossified corporate sector, one-party rule and a weak financial
system.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Nissan announced a radical plan to transform itself,
paring 20,000 workers, shutting down factories and embracing
foreign management know-how.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, too, is changing, despite the conventional wisdom that
has written it off as a moribund economic power. Here, more than in
most places, changes in business portend widespread change in the
community because business is such an integral part of Japanese
society.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, even as its economy has gone from bad to
worse, Japan has evolved, beyond the West's field of view. Change
has come so far now that even if Japan wanted to keep it a secret,
it no longer could.
</P>
<P>
   It keeps popping out and exhibiting itself like the mischievous
alter ego of the solemn puppets that appear in Japan's highly
stylized bunraku, or puppet theater, creating embarrassment and
havoc for Japan but hope and excitement in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the changes have been overshadowed by the broader
economic landscape, which remains overcast. But they are startling.
</P>
<P>
   Consider a few:
</P>
<P>
   _Japanese consumers are living better than they did during
Japan's economic bubble of the 1980s, and now they can demand
better prices, more choices and less government interference in
their economy. And they are increasingly likely to express their
displeasure at the polls: The party that has ruled Japan almost
exclusively since World War II has for the last several years
retained its grip on power only as part of a coalition, and it was
handed a humiliating setback in elections last year for the Upper
House of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   _Foreigners are being allowed to buy Japanese companies _
something once unthinkable. Japan's financial crisis has toppled
that barrier, and Japan has even allowed a crown jewel of its
industrial heyday, the Long-Term Credit Bank, to come under foreign
control. The hope is that foreign owners will bring in services
common outside Japan and force Japanese competitors to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   _Japan is continuing to place its bets on manufacturing
technology, and those bets are paying off with leadership in an
array of products, from cars that run on both electricity and
gasoline to higher-tech display screens used in computers and
cellular telephones. These investments are raising Japan's
productivity rates, with the result that Japanese workers are
working fewer hours than their American counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Milton Ezrati, an American who is chief investment officer at
Nomura Asset Management, is so convinced that change is afoot in
Japan that he named his new book on the subject ``Kawari: How
Japan's Economic and Cultural Transformation Will Alter the Balance
of Power Among Nations.'' Kawari means change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan was never going to eat us alive,'' Ezrati said. ``And
they aren't going to die a miserable death now.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the largest single impetus for change that he cites in
his book is the deregulation of the financial sector, which started
in April 1998 and has allowed a flock of American and European
bankers to begin plying their wares and services here in direct
competition with Japanese financial services companies, which were
long accustomed to operating in a largely closed market. The GE
Capital Corp., General Electric's vast financial services arm, has
snapped up several large Japanese companies, and dozens of similar
deals have been struck.
</P>
<P>
   By far the most symbolically astounding advance by foreigners
was the purchase of Long-Term Credit Bank, the institution that
bankrolled the transformation of Japan after World War II, by
Ripplewood Holdings LLC. The bank became available for acquisition
because it got itself into trouble making speculative real estate
loans and failing to use proper credit analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ripplewood intends to use the bank as a sort of skeleton
from which it can offer innovative products and services like
private banking and securities services, as well as consumer
lending, which in Japan has been a province dominated not by banks
but by specialized companies that charge exorbitant interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Major political figures were afraid that a bank controlled by
foreigners would call the loans of major corporations and political
patrons, and might discover some of the less savory aspects of the
financial back-scratching that goes on between big companies here
and many politicians. But those objections lost out to the argument
that turning Long-Term Credit over to Ripplewood would raise the
bar for all Japanese banks in much the same way that Citibank's
introduction of 24-hour automated teller machines forced them to
adopt round-the-clock banking.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, competition is already forcing changes. Two Japanese
banks, Sumitomo Bank and Sakura Bank, announced a merger that
violated a long-held Japanese taboo against lending money outside
their particular keiretsu, or cluster of manufacturing and
financial companies. But the two banks had belonged to different
groups, and the merged bank put Japan on notice that keiretsu
loyalties would no longer be sacred.

</P>

</P>
<P>
   Another sign of change has been visible in a running fight this
year between the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance _ a
result of a law that severed corrosive links between the two
institutions. Surprisingly for a country that has long kept policy
disputes behind closed doors, the bank and the ministry publicly
clashed last month when the bank refused to lower interest rates
any more, despite considerable political pressure. The battle
suggests that open, healthy debate on policy is becoming
increasingly acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Change is also afoot in Japan's traditional stronghold, the
manufacturing sector. The country's auto manufacturers, which are
its pride and joy, have been hammered hard by the domestic
recession and the economic collapse of Asia, but they have also
brought out the world's first mass-produced cars that run at least
partly on electricity. Moreover, it's becoming commonplace for even
garden-variety domestic car models to have navigation systems built
into their dashboards. It is precisely to get hold of those sorts
of new technology that Renault S.A., the French car maker,
purchased a chunk of Nissan in the spring, and then pressed Nissan
to make the changes it announced last week.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of the woes of high-tech giants like Toshiba,
NEC and Hitachi, and these companies have indeed suffered mightily
from self-imposed missteps and externally imposed hardships. But in
them, it is also possible to glimpse Japan's immense if undervalued
capacity to adapt. Their efforts to make ever better liquid crystal
displays, which are used in everything from computer screens to
cellular telephones, have allowed manufacturers like Hitachi and
NEC to roll in profits even as they stop producing money-losers
like home appliances. American companies, meanwhile, opted not to
invest in the technological development needed to manufacture
LCD's, which costs anywhere between five and eight times what it
costs to develop software.
</P>
<P>
   Eamonn Fingleton, an author and journalist who is often a lonely
optimist on the subject of Japan and its future, argues that
investment in such ``hard industries'' puts Japan in position for
far greater success than does American investment in ``soft
industries'' like the Internet. Because so much has been invested
in manufacturing here, he said, ``workers are working inevitably
with very sophisticated machines and their productivity is much
greater than it would be if they had less capital behind them.''
</P>
<P>
   The payoff for Japanese workers has been a reduction in working
hours, while American workers, off the assembly line and ensconced
in their high-tech, wired offices, are working more. In general,
average Japanese consumers are also better off today than they were
during the heady days of the economic boom more than a decade ago _
partly because prices have fallen and partly because intrepid
Japanese tourists have come back from their voyages demanding
better and different goods and services. Houses are bigger, the
number of households owning a car has increased, and the number of
Japanese traveling abroad climbed throughout the '90s until last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Although Japan's low usage of the Internet is often trotted out
as an indicator of its supposed inability to innovate, there are
signs that is changing, too. Japan surpassed Germany last year as
home to the second-largest population of Internet users after the
United States. Japanese investors have opened almost 200,000 online
trading accounts already. And while the Japanese may be behind in
their use of the Internet, many of those that are wired connect
while commuting, using only a cellular telephone about the size of
a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as much as the Japanese understand that change is
necessary, they may never fully embrace it. Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi and a host of other politicians have politely condemned
Nissan for the drastic impact its plans will have on local
communities. Japan honors and cherishes tradition, and so far many
of its economic adjustments have resulted in higher unemployment,
rising crime and more homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I truly tell my constituent to like change when, for her,
it may mean her husband gets laid off?'' asked Taro Kono, a young,
Western-educated legislator who is, in many ways, a firebrand. ``I
don't know.''

 TOKYO: be sacred.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Another sign of change has been visible in a running fight this
year between the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance _ a
result of a law that severed corrosive links between the two
institutions. Surprisingly for a country that has long kept policy
disputes behind closed doors, the bank and the ministry publicly
clashed last month when the bank refused to lower interest rates
any more, despite considerable political pressure. The battle
suggests that open, healthy debate on policy is becoming
increasingly acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Change is also afoot in Japan's traditional stronghold, the
manufacturing sector. The country's auto manufacturers, which are
its pride and joy, have been hammered hard by the domestic
recession and the economic collapse of Asia, but they have also
brought out the world's first mass-produced cars that run at least
partly on electricity. Moreover, it's becoming commonplace for even
garden-variety domestic car models to have navigation systems built
into their dashboards. It is precisely to get hold of those sorts
of new technology that Renault S.A., the French car maker,
purchased a chunk of Nissan in the spring, and then pressed Nissan
to make the changes it announced last week.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of the woes of high-tech giants like Toshiba,
NEC and Hitachi, and these companies have indeed suffered mightily
from self-imposed missteps and externally imposed hardships. But in
them, it is also possible to glimpse Japan's immense if undervalued
capacity to adapt. Their efforts to make ever better liquid crystal
displays, which are used in everything from computer screens to
cellular telephones, have allowed manufacturers like Hitachi and
NEC to roll in profits even as they stop producing money-losers
like home appliances. American companies, meanwhile, opted not to
invest in the technological development needed to manufacture
LCD's, which costs anywhere between five and eight times what it
costs to develop software.
</P>
<P>
   Eamonn Fingleton, an author and journalist who is often a lonely
optimist on the subject of Japan and its future, argues that
investment in such ``hard industries'' puts Japan in position for
far greater success than does American investment in ``soft
industries'' like the Internet. Because so much has been invested
in manufacturing here, he said, ``workers are working inevitably
with very sophisticated machines and their productivity is much
greater than it would be if they had less capital behind them.''
</P>
<P>
   The payoff for Japanese workers has been a reduction in working
hours, while American workers, off the assembly line and ensconced
in their high-tech, wired offices, are working more. In general,
average Japanese consumers are also better off today than they were
during the heady days of the economic boom more than a decade ago _
partly because prices have fallen and partly because intrepid
Japanese tourists have come back from their voyages demanding
better and different goods and services. Houses are bigger, the
number of households owning a car has increased, and the number of
Japanese traveling abroad climbed throughout the '90s until last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Although Japan's low usage of the Internet is often trotted out
as an indicator of its supposed inability to innovate, there are
signs that is changing, too. Japan surpassed Germany last year as
home to the second-largest population of Internet users after the
United States. Japanese investors have opened almost 200,000 online
trading accounts already. And while the Japanese may be behind in
their use of the Internet, many of those that are wired connect
while commuting, using only a cellular telephone about the size of
a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as much as the Japanese understand that change is
necessary, they may never fully embrace it. Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi and a host of other politicians have politely condemned
Nissan for the drastic impact its plans will have on local
communities. Japan honors and cherishes tradition, and so far many
of its economic adjustments have resulted in higher unemployment,
rising crime and more homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I truly tell my constituent to like change when, for her,
it may mean her husband gets laid off?'' asked Taro Kono, a young,
Western-educated legislator who is, in many ways, a firebrand. ``I
don't know.''

HOW MUCH GIVE CAN THE BRAIN TAKE? 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(jt) 
 By GEORGE JOHNSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   What makes the brain unique among bodily organs is that its
cells are arranged in a very specific manner _ in delicate
constellations that somehow reflect the knowledge gained from being
alive. The result is a world of individuals, a place where the very
idea of a brain transplant is absurd. You are what you think, and
what you think is laid out in your own imitable neural structures.
</P>
<P>
   But just how malleable is this cellular filigree? How easily can
a person overcome the forces _ genetic and environmental _ that
shape a creature from birth? Over the last few weeks, evidence has
emerged from several laboratories that throws these questions into
a new light. And though the experimenters don't always welcome the
moral burden, their findings are destined to be incorporated into
longstanding debates over issues as practical as the importance of
early childhood education and as profound as the perfectibility of
mankind.
</P>
<P>
   The decisions every society must make over how to rear and
educate its young or how to care for its neurologically disabled
are ultimately political. But the politicians look to the experts
and the experts look to the data. And what they find is a confusing
tension between the brain's need to be malleable _ or ``plastic'' _
enough for learning to occur and stable enough for the learning to
solidify into wisdom. The question is where nature has placed the
fulcrum. And what is ultimately being weighed is what it means to
be human.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, researchers at Princeton University issued a
report that threatens (or promises) to upset what has been one of
science's seeming certainties: that the adult brain cannot form new
neurons. Common wisdom holds that people are born with a fixed
allotment of these cells, which then die off one by one. While the
brain continues to form new connections, or synapses, between the
pre-existing components _ a process long believed to be the basis
of memory _ once a neuron is lost it is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by experimental evidence, the principle also seemed to
have logic on its side: If the essence of a brain is the precision
of its wiring, then generating hordes of new neurons might gum up
the works.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier experiments had begun chipping away at the certainty
that the ban on adult neurogenesis, as it is called, is absolute,
at least in lower vertebrates or in the human brain's more
primitive regions. (Birds apparently generate neurons to encode new
songs.) But the Princeton findings went further: Dr. Elizabeth
Gould and Dr. Charles G. Gross found that thousands of new neurons
a day were being formed in the brains of monkeys, migrating to
areas including the prefrontal cortex, the seat of intelligence and
decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   If a steady stream of fresh brain cells is continually arriving
to be incorporated into new circuitry, then the brain is more
malleable than hardly anyone has realized. Memories may be formed
not just by forging new synapses between old neurons but by weaving
in new ones as well.
</P>
<P>
   No one really knows what these new neurons do. Stuck at the end
of the Princeton paper is an arresting speculation: that the
continuum of new neurons, arriving in one batch after another,
might be the brain's way of storing memories chronologically
forming the pages of the neurological book of life.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of adult brains cranking out a steady stream of new
parts is especially startling since it has become almost gospel
that the most important neurological action occurs in the first
three years. During this developmental window, the brain explodes
with a profusion of neural connections that is then pruned back by
experience into precise circuitry. Eyes deprived of light during
this crucial period will not stimulate the formation of the neural
pathways that allow the brain to see.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, it has been feared, the damage might be far more
subtle. Without enough stimulation _ classical music and shining
objects in the crib _ children might be permanently saddled with
inferior brains.
</P>
<P>
   Like most scientific folk wisdom (``You use only 10 percent of
your brain power,'' ``Right-brained people are more creative'') the
Mozart effect, as it is sometimes called, is extrapolated from
research whose meaning is open to debate. While there is indeed a
developmental window when the infant brain is forming, it's not
clear whether heroic efforts need to be made to encourage the
process.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Myth of the First Three Years'' (Free Press, 1999), Dr.
John T. Bruer, president of the James S. McDonnell Foundation,
which supports neuroscientific research, argues that only the most
severe deprivation causes real damage, and that even that can
sometimes be reversed. ``The brain is not `cooked' by age 3 or age
10,'' he writes. ``Our brains remain remarkably plastic and we
retain the ability to learn throughout our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The new Princeton results will inevitably be taken to support
this more sanguine view. But the arguments are only beginning. Last
week the Abecedarian Project, a long-term study tracking children
of African-American families in Chapel Hill, N.C., since 1972,
announced strong evidence that high-quality day care indeed
enhanced not only the ABC's and mathematical skills but one's
success in adulthood. But it's difficult to gauge how much of the
gains came directly from neural stimulation, putting the issue more
in the political than the scientific realm.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how far scientific opinion swings toward the image of
a more fluid brain, doctors will still be left with the harsh truth
that neural wounds do not heal so readily as wounds to the skin or
bones. To a small extent, brains can recover from injuries,
especially early in life. Lost functions like language can be
transferred to other undamaged regions. But a report to appear in
next month's issue of the journal Nature Neuroscience serves as a
reminder of how intransigent some trauma can be.
</P>
<P>
   A study led by Dr. Antonio Damasio at the University of Iowa
College of Medicine found that two people who suffered injuries in
infancy, when the brain is supposed to be at its most resilient,
seemingly lost the ability to tell right from wrong. Raised in good
homes, they were otherwise intelligent. But early damage to the
prefrontal cortex seemed to have disrupted some kind of morality
circuit. If new neurons have indeed been migrating to the
decision-making centers of their brains, there is apparently a
limit to the curative powers.
</P>
<P>
   Since the study involved only two people _ childhood injuries of
this sort are thankfully rare _ the researchers may have
accidentally stumbled across exceptions to some
yet-to-be-discovered rule. But if the trend of research keeps
pointing toward more plasticity, scientists will have to learn to
harness and enhance the process before the words ``permanent brain
damage'' come to have a less horrifying ring.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how malleable the brain turns out to be, it is still
governed by its genetic heritage. For new connections to form with
ease, the underlying machinery must be in order. And the design of
these biochemical cogs is encoded in the genes.
</P>
<P>
   But with advances in genetic engineering, even these constraints
are not necessarily permanent. Maybe the most striking of the
recent experiments was another one from Princeton in which a
scientist, Dr. Joe Z. Tsien, seemingly enhanced the memories of
mice by tinkering with their DNA.
</P>
<P>
   His lab raised mice with extra copies of a gene that carries the
instructions for making an important piece of a tiny structure
called an NMDA receptor, which acts like a memory switch. When two
neurons connected by the same synapse fire at the same time, the
receptors unleash chemical reactions that strengthen the
connection. This might be how two stimuli are linked into a memory.
</P>
<P>
   Mice with the genetically souped-up receptors performed better
on learning basic tasks _ like remembering the location of a
submerged platform _ inspiring discussions about the possibilities
of treating people with memory disorders or even enhancing normal
brains.
</P>
<P>
   And so the brain, barely at the level of understanding itself,
may be on the verge of changing its own architecture. It will be up
to us all to decide whether that is an intelligent thing to do.

CYBER ENCYCLOPEDIA: THE HIGH ROAD AT A HIGH COST 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(jt) 
 By EDWARD WYATT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Internet users stampeded to visit the Encyclopaedia
Britannica's sleek new Web site last week, the venerable
intellectual icon was nearly road kill on the information highway.
</P>
<P>
   Britannica.com is busily adding computers to handle the more
than 10 million people who tried to peruse its site. But the
company also faces a much bigger question: Will its vaunted
reputation for rigor be compromised by its decision to give free
access to its vast stores of knowledge?
</P>
<P>
   In the first half of this decade, annual sales of the familiarly
bound volumes plummeted by roughly 80 percent as Britannica
miscalculated, refusing to produce a cheap, computer-based version
of the storied publication , from which most adults in America used
from grade school on and cribbed at least one science report.
</P>
<P>
   While Britannica was charging up to $2,000 for a 32-volume
edition of books, Microsoft was often giving away CD-Rom versions
of its Encarta encyclopedia to buyers of new computers. When
Britannica produced a CD-Rom, it was $1,000 initially versus $50
retail for Encarta. And when Britannica first joined the World Wide
Web, it did so with a subscription-only site, charging a fee for
access in a medium where nearly all information sites are free.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Britannica.com has joined the Internet mainstream with a
free site that is supported by the sale of advertising and by links
to an array of products for sale. But whether the new economics of
the Internet age will allow the Encyclopaedia Britannica to support
itself as a living document, constantly updated and renewed, is
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``They certainly face an uphill battle,'' said Thomas S.
Wurster, a vice president at the Boston Consulting Group and
co-author, with Philip Evans, of ``Blown to Bits: How the New
Economics of Information Transforms Strategy'' (Harvard Business
School Press), which is expected to be published next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Britannica was always thought of as a trusted adviser, known
for its rigorous quality,'' Wurster said. ``But on the Internet,
others, like Yahoo, have a better identity with core users. Because
Britannica will no longer be getting any revenues from their
content, their success will very much depend on whether they can
attract eyeballs to the site,'' and therefore be able to charge
advertisers higher rates.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the main competitors for Britannica.com are not
other encyclopedias but online services like Yahoo and America
Online is not lost on Britannica. By offering free content, it
removes any advantage gained by serviceable but generally lesser
products like Encarta, based on the old Funk &AMP; Wagnalls
encyclopedia. And Britannica.com includes not only its entire
encyclopedia but also articles from magazines like The Economist,
Esquire and Sports Illustrated, news links, stock quotes, an
Internet search service, links to Barnes &AMP; Noble's online bookstore
and other commercial sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intention is to be the premier knowledge destination
site,'' said Kent Devereaux, senior vice president for product
development and editorial at Britannica.com, based in Chicago. ``We
have found that the entire definition of the encyclopedia has to
change. If that puts us into the same space as Yahoo and America
Online, so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Working to insure that its intellectual edge is not lost will
be, in addition to the traditional team of Britannica researchers,
a second group of content specialists. Their focus will be
preparing weekly updates on current events _ a vast improvement
over the biennial updates of the old print version _ plus taking
advantage of the Internet's audio and video capabilities. While
adding researchers, it has eliminated the door-to-door sales staff
that accounted for most of the cost of the printed version.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming response to Tuesday's unveiling of
Britannica.com showed that the name Britannica retains its cachet
in this country and around the world. If Britannica.com can
continue to attract a passionate audience among the information
generation, it will serve as a stellar example of how companies
that are late adapting to new technologies can end up on top _ if
they have a superior product. But such a brainy product must still
compete in a medium based on entertainment and commerce as much as
information.
</P>
<P>
   And just think what might have been: Even if Britannica.com
eventually completes an initial public offering of stock, it will
probably never catch up to Yahoo's $46 billion market value. For
succor, Britannica.com might consult its own Web site. The
Encyclopaedia Britannica has no entry for ``business failure.'' But
type in those words on its search engine and a visitor will be
offered the chance to buy a potentially helpful book _ titled
``When Things Go Wrong: Organizational Failures &AMP; Breakdowns.''

edition of books, Microsoft was often giving away CD-Rom versions
of its Encarta encyclopedia to buyers of new computers. When
Britannica produced a CD-Rom, it was $1,000 initially versus $50
retail for Encarta. And when Britannica first joined the World Wide
Web, it did so with a subscription-only site, charging a fee for
access in a medium where nearly all information sites are free.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Britannica.com has joined the Internet mainstream with a
free site that is supported by the sale of advertising and by links
to an array of products for sale. But whether the new economics of
the Internet age will allow the Encyclopaedia Britannica to support
itself as a living document, constantly updated and renewed, is
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``They certainly face an uphill battle,'' said Thomas S.
Wurster, a vice president at the Boston Consulting Group and
co-author, with Philip Evans, of ``Blown to Bits: How the New
Economics of Information Transforms Strategy'' (Harvard Business
School Press), which is expected to be published next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Britannica was always thought of as a trusted adviser, known
for its rigorous quality,'' Wurster said. ``But on the Internet,
others, like Yahoo, have a better identity with core users. Because
Britannica will no longer be getting any revenues from their
content, their success will very much depend on whether they can
attract eyeballs to the site,'' and therefore be able to charge
advertisers higher rates.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the main competitors for Britannica.com are not
other encyclopedias but online services like Yahoo and America
Online is not lost on Britannica. By offering free content, it
removes any advantage gained by serviceable but generally lesser
products like Encarta, based on the old Funk &AMP; Wagnalls
encyclopedia. And Britannica.com includes not only its entire
encyclopedia but also articles from magazines like The Economist,
Esquire and Sports Illustrated, news links, stock quotes, an
Internet search service, links to Barnes &AMP; Noble's online bookstore
and other commercial sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intention is to be the premier knowledge destination
site,'' said Kent Devereaux, senior vice president for product
development and editorial at Britannica.com, based in Chicago. ``We
have found that the entire definition of the encyclopedia has to
change. If that puts us into the same space as Yahoo and America
Online, so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Working to insure that its intellectual edge is not lost will
be, in addition to the traditional team of Britannica researchers,
a second group of content specialists. Their focus will be
preparing weekly updates on current events _ a vast improvement
over the biennial updates of the old print version _ plus taking
advantage of the Internet's audio and video capabilities. While
adding researchers, it has eliminated the door-to-door sales staff
that accounted for most of the cost of the printed version.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming response to Tuesday's unveiling of
Britannica.com showed that the name Britannica retains its cachet
in this country and around the world. If Britannica.com can
continue to attract a passionate audience among the information
generation, it will serve as a stellar example of how companies
that are late adapting to new technologies can end up on top _ if
they have a superior product. But such a brainy product must still
compete in a medium based on entertainment and commerce as much as
information.
</P>
<P>
   And just think what might have been: Even if Britannica.com
eventually completes an initial public offering of stock, it will
probably never catch up to Yahoo's $46 billion market value. For
succor, Britannica.com might consult its own Web site. The
Encyclopaedia Britannica has no entry for ``business failure.'' But
type in those words on its search engine and a visitor will be
offered the chance to buy a potentially helpful book _ titled
``When Things Go Wrong: Organizational Failures &AMP; Breakdowns.''

Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review for
Sunday, October 24, have moved. 
(jt) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; On the dress page: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BRAIN-REVIEW (Undated) _ What makes the brain unique among
bodily organs is that its cells are arranged in a very specific
manner _ in delicate constellations that somehow reflect the
knowledge gained from being alive. The result is a world of
individuals, a place where the very idea of a brain transplant is
absurd. You are what you think, and what you think is laid out in
your own imitable neural structures. But just how malleable is this
cellular filigree? By George Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-REVIEW (Tokyo) _ In the last decade, even as its economy
has gone from bad to worse, Japan has evolved, beyond the West's
field of view. Change has come so far now that even if Japan wanted
to keep it a secret, it no longer could. By Stephanie Strom.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Also moving in the `a' category: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ News highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   WAR-HEROES-REVIEW (Washington) _ American voters have long known
Vice President Al Gore as the son of a distinguished politician, as
an avowed environmentalist with a best-selling book on the topic
and as President Clinton's loyal liege. But recently, Gore has been
reminding the electorate of another, less commonly cited dimension
of his history and identity: his military service in Vietnam. But
does anyone care about war heroes anymore? By Frank Bruni.
</P>
<P>
   BASEBALL-RISK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Travelers do it in the wake of
a terrorist attack when they decide to drive to Florida for
vacation rather than get on a plane. Diners do it when they forego
a sandwich at lunch and then load up on iced tea and fat-free
cookies in the mid-afternoon. And Bobby Valentine, the manager of
New York Mets, did it during the sixth game of the National League
Championship Series, perhaps costing his team a chance to advance
to the World Series. Call it the misunderstanding of cumulative
risk. By David Leonhardt.
</P>
<P>
   ENCYCLOPEDIAS-REVIEW (Undated) _ As Internet users stampeded to
visit the Encyclopaedia Britannica's sleek new Web site last week,
the venerable intellectual icon was nearly road kill on the
information highway. Britannica.com is busily adding computers to
handle the more than 10 million people who tried to peruse its
site. But the company also faces a much bigger question: Will its
vaunted reputation for rigor be compromised by its decision to give
free access to its vast stores of knowledge? By Edward Wyatt.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-REVIEW (Undated) _ This month marks the 30th
anniversary of the Arpanet, the Internet's predecessor. Then again,
maybe it doesn't. As barbs fly and longstanding friendships
disintegrate, figuring out just who did what when is more difficult
than ever. By Katie Hafner.
</P>
<P>
   CELEBS-IPO-REVIEW (Undated) _ The news from Wall Street last
week drew attention to probably the most startling contrast
imaginable in American popular culture: Martha Stewart and the
World Wrestling Federation, both going public on the same day.
Investors were clearly more enamored with the mistress of
domesticity than with the minders of Stone Cold Steve Austin and
The Rock. By George Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Also moving in the `i' category: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CHILE-IDENTITY-REVIEW (Santiago) _ Chileans like to call
themselves the English of Latin America, referring to their
reserved social etiquette and taste for afternoon tea, proper
high-cut clothes and Tudor architecture. Probing even deeper into
the national psyche, Chilean intellectuals identify national traits
that hark back to another English century entirely. By Clifford
Krauss.
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA-RELIGION-REVIEW (Jakarta) _ It doesn't take a
theologian to describe the political role of Islam here. ``We are
Muslims, but when we vote, we put Islam to one side,'' said Hasan
Bisri, a 60-year-old fisherman, as he waited to cast his ballot.
``In Indonesia we put the nation first and our religion second.''
This may sound odd to many Americans, who for 20 years have looked
at Iran as the model for Islamic rule and are therefore wary of the
prospect of Islamic clerics taking power anywhere. By Seth Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   SIERRA-LEONE-REVIEW (Freetown) _ The camp for amputees lies on a
hill in the most scenic stretch of Freetown, a favorite spot for
British vacationers before war destroyed Sierra Leone. Most of the
amputees in this camp _ there were 516 when Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright paid a visit Monday _ were mutilated by rebels
who advanced on Freetown last January. Many were taken to the
city's main public hospital where they languished for days; then
many went to a refugee camp at the national stadium where they
languished for weeks. Eventually they arrived at this camp, which
is run by Doctors Without Borders. By Norimitsu Onishi.

(lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; THE TENNIS PARTNER &LR;  By Abraham Verghese. Harper Perennial, $14.
A physician's story of his friendship with a young Australian
intern struggling to maintain control of his inner demons is also
one about medicine, grief and, above all, human nature. ``Verghese
is a fine writer, lyrical and controlled, and he captures the
attachment between the two men _ its motives, its allure _ with
both precision and charm,'' Caroline Knapp wrote in The New York
Times Book Review in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE LOVE OF A GOOD WOMAN: Stories &LR;  By Alice Munro. Vintage
Contemporaries, $13. Most of these eight long stories are rooted
around 1960 and deal with the way people lived then and how they
live now, offering a rich portrait of a generation of women who
discovered a different set of rules in adulthood. This collection,
which was selected by the editors of The New York Times Book Review
as one of the best books of 1998, is ``characteristically superb,''
Michael Gorra wrote. At times ``Munro's work has the dazzling but
utterly illusory simplicity of the Wordsworth who ... could
collapse one moment, one memory, into another with an unrivaled
combination of clarity and subtlety.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BILL EVANS: How My Heart Sings &LR;  By Peter Pettinger. Yale
University, $15.95. The first full-length biography of the
enormously influential jazz pianist is as interested in his
exquisite playing as it is in his long private struggle with heroin
and cocaine addiction, which led to his death in 1980. The ``book
is packed with ... shrewd critical commentary,'' Terry Teachout
wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; READING JAZZ: A Gathering of Autobiography, Reportage, and
Criticism From 1919 to Now &LR; , edited by Robert Gottlieb (Vintage,
$20), features about 150 previously published pieces pulled
together by a noted book and magazine editor. ``This comprehensive
and intelligently organized collection reflects not just editorial
skill but a well-informed enthusiasm for the music,'' Peter
Keepnews wrote in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE HUNDRED DAYS &LR;  By Patrick O'Brian. Norton, $13.95. In the
19th installment in the author's popular franchise of naval
historical novels, the bluff Commodore Jack Aubrey and the
brilliant ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin take on Balkan and North
African mercenaries during the hundred days between Napoleon's
escape from Elba and Waterloo. ``There is no doubt the fans will
like'' this tale, Paul Kennedy wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE ROAD HOME &LR;  By Jim Harrison. Washington Square/Pocket Books,
$14. Five members of a part-Sioux family take turns narrating the
history of three generations of their Nebraska clan and their
complex connections to one another and to the natural world. ``To
read this book is to feel the luminosity of nature in one's own
being,'' Thomas McNamee wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WALKING WITH THE WIND: A Memoir of the Movement &LR;  By John Lewis
with Michael D'Orso. Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $15. In chronicling
how the 1960s changed the United States (and his own role in that
transformation), an eminent civil rights leader revisits the
triumphant first half of the decade and the assassinations and
disillusionment that followed. Last year the reviewer William H.
Chafe called this a ``powerful memoir'' written ``with simplicity
and passion.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TROUBLE IN MIND: Black Southerners in the Age of Jim Crow &LR; , by
Leon F. Litwack (Vintage, $17), is a harrowing study of the South
between Reconstruction and World War I, a nightmare world of
segregation, brutal violence, disfranchisement, dashed dreams of
freedom and indignities large and small. ``Litwack's is a
heartbreaking book about a heartbreaking time,'' Edward L. Ayers
wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RUBY &LR;  By Ann Hood. Picador USA, $13. This novel about the
strange bond between a grieving widow and a pregnant teen-age
runaway explores the unpredictable demands of sorrow. Last year the
reviewer Megan Harlan admired ``Hood's caustic wit, brightly
detailed prose and thoughtful delineations of two women struggling
with private, powerful regrets.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LIKE NEVER BEFORE &LR;  By Ehud Havazelet. Anchor, $12.95. These 10
interlocking stories about two generations of an Orthodox Jewish
family are unpredictable in their aims but share themes of
assimilation, the unforgivingness of time and the wasting of love.
The author ``can wriggle inside the personality of just about
anybody,'' Craig Seligman wrote last year. ``The writing soars.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CEREUS BLOOMS AT NIGHT &LR;  By Shani Mootoo. Bard/Avon, $12.50. Set
on an imaginary Caribbean island, this tale is about two displaced
souls whose marriage sets off an explosive chain of events, ranging
from adultery to murder. ``Mootoo's impressive first novel mixes
elements of magic realism and Gothic horror in a style that is by
turns lyrical and lurid,'' Diane Cole wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AFTER SILENCE: Rape and My Journey Back &LR;  By Nancy Venable
Raine. Three Rivers, $14. In this bold account of the author's rape
in 1985 and its aftermath, she digs deep to analyze the feelings of
profound violation, rage, self-blame and shame brought on by the
crime. ```After Silence' is a book that dignifies the human
spirit,'' Richard Shweder wrote in 1998. ``It should be read by
everyone.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: All the news that's fit to pique
 &HT;    (For release Oct. 27, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the last decade or so, in a runup to the millennium
observance, the media has been packaging much of its information
into trendy lists: the 100 Best Movies of the Century, the
All-Century Baseball Team, the 20,000 Women in the Late Wilt
Chamberlain's Life.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers also play a role. Several publications _ both newspapers
and news magazines _ regularly produce numerical lists such as :
714, the number of home runs hit by Babe Ruth, or 1, the number of
children produced by the Bill and Hillary Clinton marriage.
</P>
<P>
   In order to do this, editors have had to strain much as a
crossword puzzle creator strains to shroud his clues. (Example from
last Sunday's New York Times: 47 Down, ``D.D.E. for one'' _ three
letters.)
</P>
<P>
   I am drawn to these numerical lists, not so much because they
interest me, but because they often are a puzzle unto themselves.
The people who put them together are worthy successors to those
who, decades ago, produced what were called ``fillers'' in
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The ``fillers'' usually were no more than three or four lines,
without a headline, and at the bottom of a story that ran too
short. That's where I learned _ and have since forgotten _ how long
fingernails grow in a day, how many cubic feet of water is in the
Caspian Sea and how fast a cheetah can run.
</P>
<P>
   The modern ``fillers'' people, those who now produce lists and
numerical litanies, are stretched to meet the demand to produce
and, thus, fall into the footsteps of the enigmatic crossword
puzzle creators.
</P>
<P>
   Reading one such numerical list in a news magazine the other
day, I perfectly understood what the height in meters (468.48) that
a new Chicago skyscraper will be, even though I can't fully fathom
meters. But it was telling me that a building in Chicago will be
this high.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the next item that threw me. Quote:
</P>
<P>
   ``20,000: Level, in becquerels, of radioactive cesium per
kilogram found in wild boar caught by hunters in Bavaria, 13 years
after Chernobyl.''
</P>
<P>
   Likely, this is a significant finding. But, first, it drove me
to a dictionary. I am neither a rocket scientist nor a member of
the Mensa Society. I suppose a lot of people know what a
``becquerel'' is but I don't and am not ashamed to admit it. I also
don't know what ``cesium'' is. (Neither does the Spell Check on my
computer.)
</P>
<P>
   I did not know whether or not to be alarmed by this information,
or whether it was good or bad for the wild boar.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I looked up the words in a dictionary and found that
``becquerel'' is a unit for measuring radioactive decay and that
``cesium'' is a chemical element, the most electropositive of all
the elements. Gee.
</P>
<P>
   Now knowing all that, what does it mean? Does this tell us that
the wild boar in Bavaria as well as the rest of us are in trouble?
Or does it mean that the Chernobyl scare is behind us? Are 20,000
becquerels of radioactive cesium per kilogram good or bad?
   Perhaps this is information best not left to formulated
listings.
</P>
<P>
   This, alone, was not the sole reason I was perplexed by the
numerical list. The next number left more questions than answers _
``300 billion: Dollars needed annually to save the planet,
according to scientists from Cambridge and Sheffield.''
</P>
<P>
   And to finish it off, it concluded with this piece of coherent
information:
</P>
<P>
   ``40: Number of nanograms of the sex pheromone splendipherin a
male magnificent tree frog (Litoria splendida) needs to attract a
female.
</P>
<P>
   Oh.

 &HT;    Defenders of state-sponsored religion have disowned heritage
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ I don't understand why Chet Edwards' detractors
haven't criticized him for pandering to Baptists.
</P>
<P>
   Pandering. That's right.
</P>
<P>
   Understand, you couldn't blame an office-holder around here for
pandering to Baptists. It's Waco's second-largest two-legged
subgroup, grackles first.
</P>
<P>
   So, accuse him of this: being a back-pocket guy to Baptists on
their historic positions, like telling government to stay out of
religion.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. Against state-organized (and student majority-led)
school prayer. Against posting of the Ten Commandments in school
halls. Against the ``Religious Freedom Amendment'' which would open
the door to school vouchers going to religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   You're saying that a lot of Baptists support those things.
Please admit: It's pretty ironic.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards has become one of Congress' most prominent spokesmen
against state meddling in religion. This even when it puts him at
odds with religious conservatives, of which Central Texas has many.
</P>
<P>
   Recently Edwards stood on the floor of the House to oppose a
resolution for a national day of prayer. Edwards against prayer?
No. Against government telling citizens how to live their religious
lives? Yes.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution contained these words: ``Whereas it is the
necessary duty of the people not only to humbly offer up our
prayers.'' And, ``it is incumbent on all public bodies, as well as
private persons, to revere and rely on God Almighty for our
day-to-day existence.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't imagine most Protestants would disagree with the
necessity of prayer. But most Protestants ought to squirm when
government tells them it's their duty.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards did more than squirm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of having a national voluntary day of prayer is one I
can support,'' he told the House, ``but ... I am deeply bothered by
the clauses of this resolution which would put the U.S. Congress on
record as telling individuals that it is a 'necessary duty' to
pray.''
</P>
<P>
   Government, stay out of matters of religion. If that's not a
fundamental Baptist line, it should be, because Baptists fled to
America to get away from state-established religion.
</P>
<P>
   The same for Protestants in general.
</P>
<P>
   Or didn't you know that?
</P>
<P>
   It seems that as a group, so-called conservative Protestants
selectively have forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of Protestantism was rebellion against majoritarian
oppression. Martin Luther led a movement against the Catholicism
that dominated Europe. Bloody inquisitions were staged by despots
of faith to keep belief and believers in line.
</P>
<P>
   Among the rebels, among the first Protestants, were the
Anabaptists. So rebellious and individualistic were they that they
didn't last long as one kind. They split into Baptists, Mennonites,
Dunkers, Moravians and other bands and brands.
</P>
<P>
   When Columbus discovered fertile ground across an ocean and the
Pilgrims planted seeds of European culture thereon, Protestants saw
in the American continent a religious sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   But religious freedom didn't last long.
</P>
<P>
   Once ensconced in colonies, religion proved as oppressive and
exclusive as the influences fled. The Puritans of the Massachusetts
Bay Colony, for example, declared any Anabaptist persona non grata.
</P>
<P>
   It was this atmosphere that motivated the framers of the
Constitution to forbid establishment of religion.
</P>
<P>
   As to the phrase, ``wall of separation between church and
state,'' reviled as heretical by the religious right, Baptists have
their fingerprints on it. The words were penned by Thomas Jefferson
in a letter to the Danbury Baptist Association.
</P>
<P>
   Take note, sons and distant cousins of Anabaptists. Jefferson
wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely
between man and his God, that he owes account to none other for his
faith or his worship, that the legislative power of government
reach actions only, and not opinions ...''
</P>
<P>
   On separating church and state, Jefferson was pandering to
Protestants.

 &HT;    Elizabeth Dole quit without showing what she had to offer
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The last woman who ran for president, Patricia
Schroeder, quit the race in an emotional outburst of tears.
Elizabeth Dole quit this week with a chilling, unemotional
declaration: Money is the message, and she couldn't raise enough of
it.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder, the trail-blazing congresswoman from Colorado and
liberal champion of women's rights, left her mark on public policy.
But the conservative Dole honed a style that was feminine and
presidential _ a style other women politicians will emulate.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in front of every podium, stepping close to her
audience, exuding warmth without losing her professional demeanor,
Dole symbolically took down the barriers that often keep men from
hearing what a woman politician is saying, especially on matters
like tax policy, foreign affairs and nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   Both Schroeder and Dole are Harvard Law graduates who brought
sterling qualifications and unquestioned integrity to the arena of
presidential politics _ although they espoused very different
political philosophies.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two, Dole had the best shot of making it.
</P>
<P>
   She was running close behind George W. Bush, the man she says
has raised 80 times more campaign money than she did. When she quit
last week, she noted that there's an America outside the Beltway,
including a lot of young, enthusiastic women who cared more about
her candidacy than the money gap might indicate. But Dole left
those women without a clear reason to continue the struggle for a
woman president.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder didn't do that.
</P>
<P>
   She crafted the original family values message even though it
was later hijacked and distorted by the religious right. Her style
was often sarcastic, sometimes so abrasive that her supporters
winced. But she made her mark. Because of her work, there isn't a
candidate in either party today who turns a cold shoulder to issues
that affect working women, family health care, child care, family
leave and preschool education. Schroeder made those so-called
women's issues everybody's issues. And she wasn't afraid to face
off with those in her party who disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   Dole could have used her dramatic exit to make a real difference
on the issue she claimed caused her to quit _ the dominance of
money in politics. But that would have required bucking her party,
which she was not willing to do. Only on the gun issue did she veer
from GOP dogma, and it was a safe veering. She said weapons like
the AK-47 ought to be illegal, and gun safety locks should be
mandated. But she refused to say how she'd vote on the
McCain-Feingold campaign finance bill the day after her party
killed it in the U.S. Senate for the fourth time.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what she'd do about the money problem, she mouthed
the warmed-over Bob Dole position on reform. She talked about the
need for full disclosure and the ``phasing down'' of soft money _
the 800-pound gorilla that makes big bucks more important than big
issues.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't even explain why she was having money trouble. She
hinted that she didn't have the good ol' boy networks to tap and
that coming out of a humanitarian organization, the Red Cross, she
wasn't able to leverage big contributions. There was something
hollow about that as the reason to quit.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the puzzle was why her husband's vast financial contacts
didn't pay off for her in the way former President George Bush's
have for his son. Maybe Bob Dole should step up and answer that
question. After all, his old nemesis Bill Clinton is missing no
opportunity to raise money for his wife's senatorial bid.
</P>
<P>
   When Schroeder ran for president, she talked about the dimension
women bring to the policy table by virtue of their life experiences
_ the understanding of equal partnerships, the inclusiveness, the
peace-making skills, the practical view of how policies, from
defense to the environment, affect human relationships.

   Dole said the country is surely ready for a woman president, but
she never shared why a woman president might make a difference.
Until women like Dole answer that question and stick out the
battle, there won't be one.

 &HT;    Before hammering or painting, check some fix-it tips
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When it comes to leaky toilets, drafty windows and
squeaking doors, most of us turn to the Yellow Pages and our credit
cards instead of the computer.
</P>
<P>
   But that beige box on your desk and the World Wide Web can be
more useful than a hammer when it comes to taking care of many
ordinary household chores. While you may eventually use that
hammer, you may also find some advice that saves money and your
thumbs.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start our do-it-yourself tour of the Web at a site called,
logically enough, Doityourself
</P>
<P>
   .Com at www.doityourself.com/. Tips are divided into categories,
and almost everything, including the kitchen sink, is available.
There are too many categories to list entirely, but among topics
covered are brick and masonry, building and plans, cleaning,
electrical, flooring, glass and windows, hardware, kitchens and
baths, and painting.
</P>
<P>
   To gve you a notion of the depth of the advice, let's look at
just a snippet of the tips offered on the fairly common
do-it-yourself job of replacing an electrical wall switch:
</P>
<P>
   1. Determine the type of switch needed. If the light can be
turned on from two different wall switches, buy a ``3-way switch.''
If only one switch turns on light, buy a ``regular switch.''
</P>
<P>
   2. Remove fuse or flip circuit breaker to ``off'' at the panel
box, usually found on the ground floor or basement.
</P>
<P>
   3. Unscrew and remove the face plate from the wall switch. And
so on ...
</P>
<P>
   The advice is accurate and easy to follow, even for someone with
no experience at all. You will note, however, that the text is
rather sloppy. Two typographical or spelling errors were found (and
corrected in this column) in the section quoted. That sort of
sloppy editing may frighten the novice into worrying that the
advice itself is sloppy. At least on the items checked, it was not.
</P>
<P>
   Our next stop is a place called the Hints-n-Tips Web site at
hints-n-tips.com/. The material here also is organized into
categories such as plumbing, appliance care, and DIY
(do-it-yourself). This site doesn't have the depth of the first one
(although when a topic is covered, it seems to be covered clearly
and accurately). One possible reason for the lack of detail is that
many of the hints have nothing to do with the home. Instead, there
are categories for travel, food and drink, computer repair, and
leisure. Some people may like the notion of a one-step Web site for
hints and tips of all kinds.
</P>
<P>
   You won't be surprised to learn that Martha Stewart _ the
doyenne of do-it-yourself _ has a Web site of her own. It's at www
</P>
<P>
   .marthastewart.com/. Most of the tips here involve decorating.
This isn't the place to go if you want a lively debate on the
merits of cordless drills or the real scoop on jigsaws. On the
other hand, where could you find another site that suggests so many
cool things to do with pine cones?
</P>
<P>
   Our last stop is at Ask Annie Household Tips and Formulas.
You'll find it at www.ecomall
</P>
<P>
   .com/greenshopping/annie
</P>
<P>
   .htm. If you have a moldy refrigerator (in other words, if you
are a single guy) or need to clean up a filthy Fiberglas bathtub,
this is the place for you. You'll get practical tips on some
real-world problems that may not be as cool as figuring out how to
build a new deck, but that you are a lot more likely to face. One
great feature of this rather plain Jane site is it gives you the
ability to get answers to specific questions by sending an e-mail.

 &HT;    iBook's appeal deeper than looks
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If my 12-year-old son is any example, computer
columnist John Dvorak is wrong. Boys aren't turned off by the
``girlish'' look of Apple's new portable computer, the iBook.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, my son can't seem to keep his hands off of the
clam-shaped, iridescent blue-and-white iBook. He takes it in the
car. He takes it to piano lessons. He even takes into the bathroom.
I suspect he'll take it with us to New Jersey when we visit my
mother for Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   What draws my son to this funny-looking, 6.6-pound hunk of
glowing plastic, rubber and metal runs deeper than looks alone. In
its design, Apple has managed to convey a sense that the iBook is a
special computer just for kids. That means: Hands off, Dad.
</P>
<P>
   Given my son's attachment, I'm betting the iBook will be a big
hit for Apple when the computer finally reaches full distribution.
Right now the company is struggling to get iBooks into customers'
hands, beset by unexpected problems with its suppliers of parts.
</P>
<P>
   Besides looks, the iBook includes several other innovations. The
battery lasts up to six hours, one of the longest battery lives for
any portable. There's a handle on the back that lets you carry the
iBook like a briefcase. The computer is surprisingly easy to carry
this way, despite its weight.
</P>
<P>
   The iBook also can connect wirelessly to the Internet. It does
so through an antenna hidden in the plastic lid.
</P>
<P>
   To connect wirelessly, though, you'll need two other devices: a
$100 internal card and something called an AirPort, a $299 base
station that can connect any iBook within 150 feet to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The AirPort isn't available yet, but is scheduled for release in
November.
</P>
<P>
   STRONG BASICS
</P>
<P>
   In addition to these innovations, the iBook is strong on the
basics. Its color 12.1-inch screen is exceptionally sharp.
Performance is crisp, and the iBook runs such demanding programs as
Microsoft's Word 98 and Excel well.
</P>
<P>
   The iBook retails for $1,599, although right now it's hard to
find. To learn more about this new portable, check out reviews at
such popular Mac Web sites as MacWorld Online, Apple Insider and
MacCentral.

 &HT;    `Cyberspace' author has new print title
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Novelist William Gibson, who coined the word
``cyberspace'' 15 years ago, talks with Yahoo Internet Life for the
magazine's November issue. Gibson discusses his sixth novel, ``All
Tomorrow's Parties.'' Ever the iconoclast, Gibson says in this
interview that he isn't a science-fiction writer. He calls his
renown from coining the term cyberspace a ``tattoo.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Web is a great marketing tool. But it's not an easy
job wooing potential customers. The October issue of Beyond
Computing looks at what it takes to make a successful business Web
site. The article discusses how to design a first-class site as
well as how to run it 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   ON CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   Building on the success of its ``The Age of Empires'' real-time
strategy game, Microsoft has released a sequel. It's called ``The
Age of Kings'' and covers the Middle Ages. In ``Age of Kings,'' you
can command up to 13 civilizations, including the Franks, Japanese,
Byzantines, Vikings, Moguls and Celts. You can also refight the
campaigns of such historical figures as Joan of Arc, Saladin and
Genghis Khan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Age of Kings,'' like its predecessor, is still largely about
warfare. But Microsoft has added new levels of complexity, letting
players win through trade or technology. This game, available only
for PCs with Windows 95 or higher, features animated violence. It's
recommended for ages 13 and older.
</P>
<P>
   Golf was among the first games on early computers. Now the game
has migrated to the newest platform, hand-held machines. Electronic
Arts has released a game for the PalmPilot called ``Tiger Woods PGA
Tour Golf.'' In this game, players are Woods or one of six other
professional golfers on replicas of PGA 18-hole courses.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Out.com unplugged itself from the Internet as
the leading Web site on gay and lesbian lifestyles and issues. Now
the site is readying a comeback, revamped with a better design and
more information. The site also has a major new partner in GFN.com,
or the Gay Financial Network. Out.com is not yet up but you'll find
GFN.com at www.gfn.com/.

 &HT;    It's nostalgia time for chip art
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Like bombardiers during World War II, computer chip
designers want to leave their mark with _ and on _ what they
create.
</P>
<P>
   In World War II, bombardiers often drew pictures or wrote
messages on the bombs that they dropped. Chip makers have, for
years, created tiny works of art on the unused space on the
prototypes of silicon chips. Circuits are smaller now, engineers
are overworked and more chip production is automated, so chip
graffiti is starting to fade.
</P>
<P>
   One Canadian company, Chipworks, is hoping to preserve a bit of
the color. The November issue of Wired magazine includes a short
piece about a miniature gallery of silicon chip art, which can be
seen at www.chipworks.com
</P>
<P>
   /SiliconGallery/07main
</P>
<P>
   .htm.
</P>
<P>
   The November issue also takes a look at a new technology called
DigiScents, which lets you smell things through your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Digital smell works when the computer sends a signal to a small
box filled with a tiny fan and small vials of scented oils. The
signals tell the small box which vial to heat. The fan pushes the
smell out of the box and into your nose.
</P>
<P>
   The story predicts that the first waft in the online odor wave
should be headed your way soon. DigiScents Web site,
www.digiscents.com, will be up and running soon.
</P>
<P>
   LONG-DISTANCE BARGAINS AVAILABLE
</P>
<P>
   The big long-distance phone companies now have rates as low as 5
cents a minute.
</P>
<P>
   But we are a nation of bargain hunters. If you think you could
somehow be paying less for your long-distance calls, check
iPhoneBill.com.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the company can save you money on your long-distance
bills depends on where you live, whom you call and how long you
talk. But the site has a feature in which visitors can type in
their home phone number, the number they are calling and the length
of the call to find out whether iPhoneBill.com can carry it more
cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Planet Earth Communications, offers rates as low as
2.9 cents per minute, but many are between 6 cents and 10 cents a
minute.
</P>
<P>
   The company bills calls in six-second increments.

 &HT;    Reformatting scrapes barnacles off hard drive
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There comes a point in the life of most heavily used
computers when the hard drive needs to be reformatted. With my
computers, that time comes sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the fault of the computer, of course; if anything is
to blame it's Windows 95 and 98, with their arcane registry files,
and the apparent inability of either Windows or proprietary
uninstall programs to scrape every vestige of a program off the
drive.
</P>
<P>
   Shuffling programs onto and off a hard drive makes the poor disk
accumulate barnacles like a rusty guano freighter. Since I do this
shuffle once or twice a week, it's little wonder that the barnacles
eventually become obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   I had to reformat my drive this past week, although in this case
it would be fair to call it an exorcism rather than a reformatting.
</P>
<P>
   The first indication of major difficulties came when I needed to
use Microsoft Fax. It wouldn't work. It wouldn't even start up.
Clicking on the in-box produced a message saying there wasn't
enough memory and urging me to shut down some programs, even though
none were running.
</P>
<P>
   OK, time to wipe the old slate clean.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't need to do much backing up, and accomplished it by a
direct connection via parallel port to a nice laptop computer I'm
testing. This may not be the quickest backup system, but I don't
have a tape drive and I don't care to sit around shoving Zip disks
in and out.
</P>
<P>
   Now, reformatting a hard drive is easy. The tricky thing is
regaining control of it once it's wiped clean. To make sure I
didn't get stuck somewhere out there in cyberspace, I checked in
with Gateway support before starting the operation. Hey, I'm just
smart enough to know how things can leap up and bite you when you
aren't looking. If you get professional advice, you can always
blame any subsequent problems on the adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, the advice didn't work. I called back and got some
advice from somebody else. It ultimately didn't work either, but it
got me to a point where I could figure out what to do to make
things right.
</P>
<P>
   A major problem is having only a Windows 98 upgrade disk. An
upgrade disk doesn't want to work if it can't find a previous
version of Windows on the drive. As a result, I had to install
Windows 95 and then promptly upgrade it to 98. The entire operation
probably required four hours, although I spread it over a couple of
evenings.
</P>
<P>
   Here I sit now, looking at a computer with nothing on it but
Windows 98, Eudora Pro, Netscape and Agent. Boots like lightning.
Shuts down in a wink. It's like having a new computer again.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, the ghost is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Some of you may remember the bizarre problem that arose a year
ago, not long after I got the computer, when I found that the
machine was turning itself on every midnight. The only way I could
prevent it was to unplug it. I got a surge protector, and that
didn't do any good, except I could use it to turn off the power to
the computer and thus prevent the weird midnight boot.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody, not even Gateway, could figure out the problem. But the
reformat cured it, proving the problem lay somewhere in the
software.
</P>
<P>
   I'm going to try another way of preventing the buildup of
barnacles, which is to use one of the many programs that will store
a copy of the registry file. If I store a copy of a good registry
file before installing a program, then after removing the program
with the Windows Remove Program feature, I can restore the registry
as it was before the program was installed.
</P>
<P>
   This should cure the problem _ if I can remember to do it.

 &HT;    Microsoft makes breakthrough in mouse hygiene
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If cars were designed like your computer mouse, rush
hour would last a couple of days.
</P>
<P>
   Just to move your cursor on the screen, the mouse goes through
as much rolling and turning and spinning inside as a washing
machine. So things can get messed up easily. And the mouse is a big
deal _ almost everything you do with your computer requires rolling
and clicking that mouse.
</P>
<P>
   People _ me included _ tend to be more fascinated by trendier
things such as processor chips, the merits of the size of the cache
and the speed of the chip. Hardly a day goes by without
near-hysterical news about some new version of Windows or an
even-faster chip from Intel.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes down to using a computer, some things haven't
changed much in the last decade. For the most part, we communicate
with the computer by typing on a keyboard much like the one on the
Royal Office Model typewriter I used to torture at my first
newspaper job. And while the mouse is relatively new, it hasn't
changed much since the days of the first Macintosh computer.
</P>
<P>
   If you dissect the mouse on your computer desk, you'll see that
_ as you roll it on the mouse pad _ a small rubber ball inside
rolls along with it. That ball rests against rollers that translate
the motion into electrical signals your computer can understand.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot of steps just to move the cursor on your screen.
And since the mouse is mostly mechanical, all sorts of things
happen to it during the course of its life ... few of them good.
The ball gets coated with dirt and, in turn, transfers that dirt to
the rollers. Pretty soon, the innards of the mouse are all gunked
up and your cursor will be jumping around like a hyperactive frog.
</P>
<P>
   So today, we'll do two things: discuss cleaning the critter and
talk about one of the first real innovations in the mouse since the
cat was invented.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaning is simple. Just remove the rubber ball and clean it
with a mild soap-and-water solution (wipe the mouse pad down with
the same solution, since removing the dirt there will keep your
mouse working better). Then use a cotton-tipped swab soaked in
alcohol to clean the rollers inside the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   To keep your mouse perking along, you'll need to repeat the
cleaning about once a month.
</P>
<P>
   But if all that sounds like a hassle, there's finally hope for
those of you who do not wish to bathe mice. Microsoft has
introduced what I like to think of as an, uh, altered mouse. It has
no ball inside. Instead, it uses a light beam that shines on your
desktop (you no longer need a mouse pad, although you may find that
you feel more comfortable using it anyway).
</P>
<P>
   Things being the way they are, this new mouse won't get the
attention that the press gives a new release of Windows or a new
chip from Intel. After all _ and I've been using the new mouse for
several weeks now _ it really works the same as a clean,
well-functioning mechanical mouse. Microsoft says it is more
precise than a regular mouse, and maybe it is. But I didn't notice
the difference.
</P>
<P>
   But you'll never have to clean it and never have to hunt up a
new mouse pad when the old one starts to feel weird.
</P>
<P>
   The new gadget _ called the optical Intellimouse Explorer_ sells
for about $75, or you can get a less-fancy model for $55 or so.
Buying one won't change your life, make your spreadsheets more
accurate or your e-mails more fascinating. All it will do is ensure
that you'll never have to bathe a mouse again.
</P>
<P>
   For my money, that's a bargain.

 &HT;    Make personalized greeting cards for all occasions
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ If you often find yourself spending hours in
front of greeting card racks futilely searching for the card that
features the perfect illustration and says just what you want to
say just the way you want to say it, you may be a candidate for
home greeting card software.
</P>
<P>
   Greeting card software allows you to create personalized cards
that can include the name of the person receiving the card, your
own specific messages and family photos.
</P>
<P>
   American Greetings CreataCard Platinum 4 is capable of producing
all kinds of cards and invitations, plus it can make post cards,
photo calendars, posters, decorative labels and other desktop
publishing items. The package comes with a sample pack of greeting
card paper and envelopes.
</P>
<P>
   The software package can also be used to design Web pages, and
American Greetings claims users can do more than 500,000 projects
with it.
</P>
<P>
   CreataCard Platinum 4 has a manufacturer's suggested retail
price of $49.99, and it's available in most stores where software
is sold. The package includes three CD-ROMs packed with drawings,
photos, verses and borders. One of the CD-ROMs sets up a connection
to American Greetings' online Art &AMP; More Store, where you can buy
extra illustrations and verses.
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, CreataCard Platinum 4 has a user-friendly
main screen. It's immediately apparent how many different things
you can do and how to get started.
</P>
<P>
   On the negative side, the images and verses you'll use are split
between two CD-ROMs requiring switching discs. Also the package's
system for helping you print on both sides of the paper is somewhat
cumbersome.

 &HT;    Make personalized greeting cards for all occasions
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ If you often find yourself spending hours in
front of greeting card racks futilely searching for the card that
features the perfect illustration and says just what you want to
say just the way you want to say it, you may be a candidate for
home greeting card software.
</P>
<P>
   Greeting card software allows you to create personalized cards
that can include the name of the person receiving the card, your
own specific messages and family photos.
</P>
<P>
   American Greetings CreataCard Platinum 4 is capable of producing
all kinds of cards and invitations, plus it can make post cards,
photo calendars, posters, decorative labels and other desktop
publishing items. The package comes with a sample pack of greeting
card paper and envelopes.
</P>
<P>
   The software package can also be used to design Web pages, and
American Greetings claims users can do more than 500,000 projects
with it.
</P>
<P>
   CreataCard Platinum 4 has a manufacturer's suggested retail
price of $49.99, and it's available in most stores where software
is sold. The package includes three CD-ROMs packed with drawings,
photos, verses and borders. One of the CD-ROMs sets up a connection
to American Greetings' online Art &AMP; More Store, where you can buy
extra illustrations and verses.
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, CreataCard Platinum 4 has a user-friendly
main screen. It's immediately apparent how many different things
you can do and how to get started.
</P>
<P>
   On the negative side, the images and verses you'll use are split
between two CD-ROMs requiring switching discs. Also the package's
system for helping you print on both sides of the paper is somewhat
cumbersome.

 &HT;    Microsoft makes breakthrough in mouse hygiene
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If cars were designed like your computer mouse, rush
hour would last a couple of days.
</P>
<P>
   Just to move your cursor on the screen, the mouse goes through
as much rolling and turning and spinning inside as a washing
machine. So things can get messed up easily. And the mouse is a big
deal _ almost everything you do with your computer requires rolling
and clicking that mouse.
</P>
<P>
   People _ me included _ tend to be more fascinated by trendier
things such as processor chips, the merits of the size of the cache
and the speed of the chip. Hardly a day goes by without
near-hysterical news about some new version of Windows or an
even-faster chip from Intel.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes down to using a computer, some things haven't
changed much in the last decade. For the most part, we communicate
with the computer by typing on a keyboard much like the one on the
Royal Office Model typewriter I used to torture at my first
newspaper job. And while the mouse is relatively new, it hasn't
changed much since the days of the first Macintosh computer.
</P>
<P>
   If you dissect the mouse on your computer desk, you'll see that
_ as you roll it on the mouse pad _ a small rubber ball inside
rolls along with it. That ball rests against rollers that translate
the motion into electrical signals your computer can understand.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot of steps just to move the cursor on your screen.
And since the mouse is mostly mechanical, all sorts of things
happen to it during the course of its life ... few of them good.
The ball gets coated with dirt and, in turn, transfers that dirt to
the rollers. Pretty soon, the innards of the mouse are all gunked
up and your cursor will be jumping around like a hyperactive frog.
</P>
<P>
   So today, we'll do two things: discuss cleaning the critter and
talk about one of the first real innovations in the mouse since the
cat was invented.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaning is simple. Just remove the rubber ball and clean it
with a mild soap-and-water solution (wipe the mouse pad down with
the same solution, since removing the dirt there will keep your
mouse working better). Then use a cotton-tipped swab soaked in
alcohol to clean the rollers inside the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   To keep your mouse perking along, you'll need to repeat the
cleaning about once a month.
</P>
<P>
   But if all that sounds like a hassle, there's finally hope for
those of you who do not wish to bathe mice. Microsoft has
introduced what I like to think of as an, uh, altered mouse. It has
no ball inside. Instead, it uses a light beam that shines on your
desktop (you no longer need a mouse pad, although you may find that
you feel more comfortable using it anyway).
</P>
<P>
   Things being the way they are, this new mouse won't get the
attention that the press gives a new release of Windows or a new
chip from Intel. After all _ and I've been using the new mouse for
several weeks now _ it really works the same as a clean,
well-functioning mechanical mouse. Microsoft says it is more
precise than a regular mouse, and maybe it is. But I didn't notice
the difference.
</P>
<P>
   But you'll never have to clean it and never have to hunt up a
new mouse pad when the old one starts to feel weird.
</P>
<P>
   The new gadget _ called the optical Intellimouse Explorer_ sells
for about $75, or you can get a less-fancy model for $55 or so.
Buying one won't change your life, make your spreadsheets more
accurate or your e-mails more fascinating. All it will do is ensure
that you'll never have to bathe a mouse again.
</P>
<P>
   For my money, that's a bargain.

 &HT;    Before hammering or painting, check some fix-it tips
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When it comes to leaky toilets, drafty windows and
squeaking doors, most of us turn to the Yellow Pages and our credit
cards instead of the computer.
</P>
<P>
   But that beige box on your desk and the World Wide Web can be
more useful than a hammer when it comes to taking care of many
ordinary household chores. While you may eventually use that
hammer, you may also find some advice that saves money and your
thumbs.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start our do-it-yourself tour of the Web at a site called,
logically enough, Doityourself
</P>
<P>
   .Com at www.doityourself.com/. Tips are divided into categories,
and almost everything, including the kitchen sink, is available.
There are too many categories to list entirely, but among topics
covered are brick and masonry, building and plans, cleaning,
electrical, flooring, glass and windows, hardware, kitchens and
baths, and painting.
</P>
<P>
   To give you a notion of the depth of the advice, let's look at
just a snippet of the tips offered on the fairly common
do-it-yourself job of replacing an electrical wall switch:
</P>
<P>
   1. Determine the type of switch needed. If the light can be
turned on from two different wall switches, buy a ``3-way switch.''
If only one switch turns on light, buy a ``regular switch.''
</P>
<P>
   2. Remove fuse or flip circuit breaker to ``off'' at the panel
box, usually found on the ground floor or basement.
</P>
<P>
   3. Unscrew and remove the face plate from the wall switch. And
so on ...
</P>
<P>
   The advice is accurate and easy to follow, even for someone with
no experience at all. You will note, however, that the text is
rather sloppy. Two typographical or spelling errors were found (and
corrected in this column) in the section quoted. That sort of
sloppy editing may frighten the novice into worrying that the
advice itself is sloppy. At least on the items checked, it was not.
</P>
<P>
   Our next stop is a place called the Hints-n-Tips Web site at
hints-n-tips.com/. The material here also is organized into
categories such as plumbing, appliance care, and DIY
(do-it-yourself). This site doesn't have the depth of the first one
(although when a topic is covered, it seems to be covered clearly
and accurately). One possible reason for the lack of detail is that
many of the hints have nothing to do with the home. Instead, there
are categories for travel, food and drink, computer repair, and
leisure. Some people may like the notion of a one-step Web site for
hints and tips of all kinds.
</P>
<P>
   You won't be surprised to learn that Martha Stewart _ the
doyenne of do-it-yourself _ has a Web site of her own. It's at www
</P>
<P>
   .marthastewart.com/. Most of the tips here involve decorating.
This isn't the place to go if you want a lively debate on the
merits of cordless drills or the real scoop on jigsaws. On the
other hand, where could you find another site that suggests so many
cool things to do with pine cones?
</P>
<P>
   Our last stop is at Ask Annie Household Tips and Formulas.
You'll find it at www.ecomall
</P>
<P>
   .com/greenshopping/annie
</P>
<P>
   .htm. If you have a moldy refrigerator (in other words, if you
are a single guy) or need to clean up a filthy Fiberglas bathtub,
this is the place for you. You'll get practical tips on some
real-world problems that may not be as cool as figuring out how to
build a new deck, but that you are a lot more likely to face. One
great feature of this rather plain Jane site is it gives you the
ability to get answers to specific questions by sending an e-mail.

 &HT;    iBook's appeal deeper than looks
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If my 12-year-old son is any example, computer
columnist John Dvorak is wrong. Boys aren't turned off by the
``girlish'' look of Apple's new portable computer, the iBook.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, my son can't seem to keep his hands off of the
clam-shaped, iridescent blue-and-white iBook. He takes it in the
car. He takes it to piano lessons. He even takes into the bathroom.
I suspect he'll take it with us to New Jersey when we visit my
mother for Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   What draws my son to this funny-looking, 6.6-pound hunk of
glowing plastic, rubber and metal runs deeper than looks alone. In
its design, Apple has managed to convey a sense that the iBook is a
special computer just for kids. That means: Hands off, Dad.
</P>
<P>
   Given my son's attachment, I'm betting the iBook will be a big
hit for Apple when the computer finally reaches full distribution.
Right now the company is struggling to get iBooks into customers'
hands, beset by unexpected problems with its suppliers of parts.
</P>
<P>
   Besides looks, the iBook includes several other innovations. The
battery lasts up to six hours, one of the longest battery lives for
any portable. There's a handle on the back that lets you carry the
iBook like a briefcase. The computer is surprisingly easy to carry
this way, despite its weight.
</P>
<P>
   The iBook also can connect wirelessly to the Internet. It does
so through an antenna hidden in the plastic lid.
</P>
<P>
   To connect wirelessly, though, you'll need two other devices: a
$100 internal card and something called an AirPort, a $299 base
station that can connect any iBook within 150 feet to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The AirPort isn't available yet, but is scheduled for release in
November.
</P>
<P>
   STRONG BASICS
</P>
<P>
   In addition to these innovations, the iBook is strong on the
basics. Its color 12.1-inch screen is exceptionally sharp.
Performance is crisp, and the iBook runs such demanding programs as
Microsoft's Word 98 and Excel well.
</P>
<P>
   The iBook retails for $1,599, although right now it's hard to
find. To learn more about this new portable, check out reviews at
such popular Mac Web sites as MacWorld Online, Apple Insider and
MacCentral.

 &HT;    `Cyberspace' author has new print title
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Novelist William Gibson, who coined the word
``cyberspace'' 15 years ago, talks with Yahoo Internet Life for the
magazine's November issue. Gibson discusses his sixth novel, ``All
Tomorrow's Parties.'' Ever the iconoclast, Gibson says in this
interview that he isn't a science-fiction writer. He calls his
renown from coining the term cyberspace a ``tattoo.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Web is a great marketing tool. But it's not an easy
job wooing potential customers. The October issue of Beyond
Computing looks at what it takes to make a successful business Web
site. The article discusses how to design a first-class site as
well as how to run it 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   ON CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   Building on the success of its ``The Age of Empires'' real-time
strategy game, Microsoft has released a sequel. It's called ``The
Age of Kings'' and covers the Middle Ages. In ``Age of Kings,'' you
can command up to 13 civilizations, including the Franks, Japanese,
Byzantines, Vikings, Moguls and Celts. You can also refight the
campaigns of such historical figures as Joan of Arc, Saladin and
Genghis Khan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Age of Kings,'' like its predecessor, is still largely about
warfare. But Microsoft has added new levels of complexity, letting
players win through trade or technology. This game, available only
for PCs with Windows 95 or higher, features animated violence. It's
recommended for ages 13 and older.
</P>
<P>
   Golf was among the first games on early computers. Now the game
has migrated to the newest platform, hand-held machines. Electronic
Arts has released a game for the PalmPilot called ``Tiger Woods PGA
Tour Golf.'' In this game, players are Woods or one of six other
professional golfers on replicas of PGA 18-hole courses.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Out.com unplugged itself from the Internet as
the leading Web site on gay and lesbian lifestyles and issues. Now
the site is readying a comeback, revamped with a better design and
more information. The site also has a major new partner in GFN.com,
or the Gay Financial Network. Out.com is not yet up but you'll find
GFN.com at www.gfn.com/.

 &HT;    It's nostalgia time for chip art
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Like bombardiers during World War II, computer chip
designers want to leave their mark with _ and on _ what they
create.
</P>
<P>
   In World War II, bombardiers often drew pictures or wrote
messages on the bombs that they dropped. Chip makers have, for
years, created tiny works of art on the unused space on the
prototypes of silicon chips. Circuits are smaller now, engineers
are overworked and more chip production is automated, so chip
graffiti is starting to fade.
</P>
<P>
   One Canadian company, Chipworks, is hoping to preserve a bit of
the color. The November issue of Wired magazine includes a short
piece about a miniature gallery of silicon chip art, which can be
seen at www.chipworks.com
</P>
<P>
   /SiliconGallery/07main
</P>
<P>
   .htm.
</P>
<P>
   The November issue also takes a look at a new technology called
DigiScents, which lets you smell things through your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Digital smell works when the computer sends a signal to a small
box filled with a tiny fan and small vials of scented oils. The
signals tell the small box which vial to heat. The fan pushes the
smell out of the box and into your nose.
</P>
<P>
   The story predicts that the first waft in the online odor wave
should be headed your way soon. DigiScents Web site,
www.digiscents.com, will be up and running soon.
</P>
<P>
   LONG-DISTANCE BARGAINS AVAILABLE
</P>
<P>
   The big long-distance phone companies now have rates as low as 5
cents a minute.
</P>
<P>
   But we are a nation of bargain hunters. If you think you could
somehow be paying less for your long-distance calls, check
iPhoneBill.com.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the company can save you money on your long-distance
bills depends on where you live, whom you call and how long you
talk. But the site has a feature in which visitors can type in
their home phone number, the number they are calling and the length
of the call to find out whether iPhoneBill.com can carry it more
cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Planet Earth Communications, offers rates as low as
2.9 cents per minute, but many are between 6 cents and 10 cents a
minute.
</P>
<P>
   The company bills calls in six-second increments.

 &HT;    Reformatting scrapes barnacles off hard drive
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There comes a point in the life of most heavily used
computers when the hard drive needs to be reformatted. With my
computers, that time comes sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the fault of the computer, of course; if anything is
to blame it's Windows 95 and 98, with their arcane registry files,
and the apparent inability of either Windows or proprietary
uninstall programs to scrape every vestige of a program off the
drive.
</P>
<P>
   Shuffling programs onto and off a hard drive makes the poor disk
accumulate barnacles like a rusty guano freighter. Since I do this
shuffle once or twice a week, it's little wonder that the barnacles
eventually become obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   I had to reformat my drive this past week, although in this case
it would be fair to call it an exorcism rather than a reformatting.
</P>
<P>
   The first indication of major difficulties came when I needed to
use Microsoft Fax. It wouldn't work. It wouldn't even start up.
Clicking on the in-box produced a message saying there wasn't
enough memory and urging me to shut down some programs, even though
none were running.
</P>
<P>
   OK, time to wipe the old slate clean.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't need to do much backing up, and accomplished it by a
direct connection via parallel port to a nice laptop computer I'm
testing. This may not be the quickest backup system, but I don't
have a tape drive and I don't care to sit around shoving Zip disks
in and out.
</P>
<P>
   Now, reformatting a hard drive is easy. The tricky thing is
regaining control of it once it's wiped clean. To make sure I
didn't get stuck somewhere out there in cyberspace, I checked in
with Gateway support before starting the operation. Hey, I'm just
smart enough to know how things can leap up and bite you when you
aren't looking. If you get professional advice, you can always
blame any subsequent problems on the adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, the advice didn't work. I called back and got some
advice from somebody else. It ultimately didn't work either, but it
got me to a point where I could figure out what to do to make
things right.
</P>
<P>
   A major problem is having only a Windows 98 upgrade disk. An
upgrade disk doesn't want to work if it can't find a previous
version of Windows on the drive. As a result, I had to install
Windows 95 and then promptly upgrade it to 98. The entire operation
probably required four hours, although I spread it over a couple of
evenings.
</P>
<P>
   Here I sit now, looking at a computer with nothing on it but
Windows 98, Eudora Pro, Netscape and Agent. Boots like lightning.
Shuts down in a wink. It's like having a new computer again.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, the ghost is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Some of you may remember the bizarre problem that arose a year
ago, not long after I got the computer, when I found that the
machine was turning itself on every midnight. The only way I could
prevent it was to unplug it. I got a surge protector, and that
didn't do any good, except I could use it to turn off the power to
the computer and thus prevent the weird midnight boot.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody, not even Gateway, could figure out the problem. But the
reformat cured it, proving the problem lay somewhere in the
software.
</P>
<P>
   I'm going to try another way of preventing the buildup of
barnacles, which is to use one of the many programs that will store
a copy of the registry file. If I store a copy of a good registry
file before installing a program, then after removing the program
with the Windows Remove Program feature, I can restore the registry
as it was before the program was installed.
</P>
<P>
   This should cure the problem _ if I can remember to do it.

 &HT;    What to wear for the witching hour
 &HT;    By Cathy Hulbert
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Here's a scary thought: Halloween is just around the
corner and you don't have a costume yet.
</P>
<P>
   Wait! Don't scream! (No need to wake up the dead before their
big night.) According to some metro Atlanta kids, parents and
artists, Halloween costumes can be frighteningly simple _ and
cheap. Here are some examples to get your brain bubbling:
</P>
<P>
   THE TABLE
</P>
<P>
   Michael Leonard, 9
</P>
<P>
   Setting the table may be a grim thought, but how would you like
to be a table? Imagine yourself as a walking, talking table with
your head as the main course! To make this costume, designed by
Michael's mom, Rheba Leonard, take a box that will fit over your
shoulders and a piece of material for the tablecloth. Cut holes for
your head in both. Also cut arm holes on the sides so you can hold
your candy. Cut a neck-sized hole in a plastic buffet tray (you can
find these in the grocery store deli). Make a slice on one side so
it can open up and then wrap it around your neck.
</P>
<P>
   Glue plastic food items on the table. Add a plastic vase or
battery operated candles. You can set your table with plastic
silverware and dishes, or go ``buffet'' style, like our model.
Older kids can also ghoul it up with blood trickling from the neck.
Dinner is served!
</P>
<P>
   CAPTAIN HOOK
</P>
<P>
   Erica Grau, 13
</P>
<P>
   Aye, maties! Captain Hook the pirate is a great option for girls
and boys. Start with black clothing. Create a vest by tracing the
contours of a real vest onto two pieces of felt cloth, advises
Elise Grau, educator and costume designer for the Center for
Puppetry Arts. Cut out the vest pieces and use hot glue to attach
them together into a wearable red and black pirate's vest.
</P>
<P>
   A pirate's hat, decorated with skull and crossbones, can be made
out of black poster board. Cut out the front shape. Then cut out a
two-inch strip of cardboard that can stapled at the ends to form a
ring around the top of the head. Then staple the front shape to the
ring.
</P>
<P>
   Cut a sword out of cardboard and wrap it in heavy aluminum.
Staple a rubber band to the back of the sword to let it hang from a
belt loop. For an earring, cut a circle out of yellow poster board
and cut a slit in the side. It can rest just inside the ear on one
side and behind the ear on the other. A black felt patch can be
stapled onto elastic and worn around the head. For the captain's
``hook,'' cut out a hook shape from sturdy material (cardboard
wrapped in foil will work). Cut an x-shape into the bottom of a
plastic cup. Insert the straight end of the hook into the bottom of
a cup. Then put the top of the cup over your hand.
</P>
<P>
   THE BLACK WIDOW
</P>
<P>
   Ariel Rawls Hill, 10
</P>
<P>
   Little Miss Muffet never met a spider like this one. The black
widow costume starts with black clothing, such as leggings and a
turtleneck. Ariel's mom, Marla Rawls Hill, used inexpensive black
boas, cut them in two and stitched them to the body of the costume.
She wrapped coated metal wire around the legs to make them bouncy.
Black thread was tied to two of the legs and to Ariel's wrists so
she could make the legs move up and down. To make the body of the
costume, two pieces of black poplin material were cut into an
hourglass shape, filled with fiber fill material (used for quilts)
and attached together using seam tape and an iron. The body sits
only on Ariel's front and fits like an apron.
</P>
<P>
   THE DOG
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Pearson, 11
</P>
<P>
   If you're not into creepy-crawlies _ how about being man's best
friend. Dog costumes can resemble your favorite breed. (They can
also be made scary like Cujo!) White sweatpants and a white turtle
neck can be covered with black felt spots _ loosely hand-stitched
or even pinned on _ to make a Dalmatian, according to Cheryl
Pearson of Lithonia. Make triangular ears out of felt material. The
ears will rest on a head band if pipe cleaners are attached to the
back. Blacken your nose with face paint and use ribbon for a
collar, making it as decorative as you'd like.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget the tail, which you'll want to wag when you get
your ``treats.'' Stuff a sock with other socks and pin it to your
lower back, not so low that you can't safely sit down.
</P>
<P>
   THE MUMMY
</P>
<P>
   Jordan Housel, 9
</P>
<P>
   If you want something simple _ yet horrifying _ how about a
mummy costume made from strips of an old white sheet? Make sure you
check first with your parents, then cut a large sheet into strips
that are about 4 inches wide and as long as possible. Use fabric
glue or a needle and thread to connect the strips into one or two
really long pieces. Then wrap the material around your body,
starting with your head. You can pin the strips to your clothes to
feel more secure. Make sure that you wear white clothing
underneath, because mummies do have a way of coming unraveled.
</P>
<P>
   THE BAG OF JELLY BEANS
</P>
<P>
   Margaret DeGrace, 9
</P>
<P>
   And finally, we'll end on a sweet note. How about turning
yourself into a bag of jelly beans? Simply take a clear garbage or
lawn bag and cut holes for your arms and legs, suggests Margaret's
mom, Lisa DeGrace. Once you're inside, fill your bag with colored
balloons. Keep the costume around your neck with a piece of bright
ribbon. Curly ribbons in your hair will make you extra fancy. Make
sure you wear good running shoes. A lot of candy fiends will be out
that night!
</P>
<P>
   WATCH OUT FOR GHOSTS AND GHOULS!
</P>
<P>
   Halloween can be scary _ and sometimes not in a good way. We
want you to have a great time, but be careful out there.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some quick tips to keep you safe and make Halloween
fun:
</P>
<P>
   1. NEVER trick-or-treat alone. Younger kids should always be
accompanied by an adult. If you're older, have at least two buddies
with you at all times.
</P>
<P>
   2. Don't go inside houses. Be as cautious of strangers as you
would at any other time.
</P>
<P>
   3. Carry a flashlight, and avoid houses that are completely
dark.
</P>
<P>
   4. Don't eat your treats until you're home. Adults can help you
examine the way they are packaged. If something isn't wrapped
securely, throw it out.
</P>
<P>
   5. Don't play near lit jack-o'-lanterns, which can cause
costumes to catch fire.

 &HT;    Russia battles Chechnya
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Fighting between Russian and Chechen forces heated up
last week. Russian officials admitted attacking an open-air market
in Grozny, which is the capital of Chechnya, a region now part of
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The Chechens said the attack killed more than 100 civilians and
injured 400 others. The Russians said the market was filled with
terrorists buying weapons. The attack was the worst on Grozny since
fighting started again in September.
</P>
<P>
   Chechnya was once an independent nation and has a strong sense
of national pride, explains Loch Johnson, a political science
professor at the University of Georgia. That is why it wants to be
independent again. It has fought with Russia through much of the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   HOLIDAY TOUGH ON BLACK CATS
</P>
<P>
   Around Halloween, many black felines fall victim to pranks or
worse. So, some shelters won't allow people to adopt them until
Halloween is long gone.
</P>
<P>
   Harming a black cat _ or any animal _ is against the law in
Georgia. Currently, it's a
</P>
<P>
   misdemeanor, but animal activists would like to see it made a
felony. Felonies receive harsher punishments
</P>
<P>
   than misdemeanors.
</P>
<P>
   KIDS NEED PERMISSION TO TALK TO COMPANIES ONLINE
</P>
<P>
   The federal government announced rules last week to help protect
children when they venture online. The rules, which take effect
April 21, require parental permission before companies can collect
information about a child. The rules will also require parents be
notified before kids can enter contests online.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses who want to sell things to kids often use Web sites
to gather information, such as kids' likes, dislikes and how much
money they spend. The government wants to make sure children aren't
taken advantage of.

 &HT;    Keys to recognizing bullies, victims
 &HT;    By Hap Lecrone
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Bullying has been identified as a significant part
of the problem in many of the school violence incidents around the
country. The bullied individual often developes a pattern of anger,
resentment and rage, which may lead to an explosive acting out of
this pent-up anger.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of being bullied may include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Cuts, bruises, torn clothing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Headaches and/or stomach pains before it's time to go to
school; reluctance to go to school.
</P>
<P>
   _ Decline in grades and/or interest in school.
</P>
<P>
   _ Always ``losing'' money, school supplies or personal items.
</P>
<P>
   _ Expressed interest in being with teachers and other adults at
school rather than other students.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have indicated that between 10 percent and 15 percent of
the students in any given setting can be categorized as exhibiting
bullying behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Male bullies are likely to act out their bullying behavior in
physical ways such as pushing, tripping and hitting, and extorting
or stealing money and possessions. Females often bully in a verbal
manner, such as name calling, manipulating relationships in order
to exclude the victim and other indirect means of hurting their
victims.
</P>
<P>
   Bullies tend to have some of the following characteristics in
common:
</P>
<P>
   _ They tend to lack empathy for those they victimize. They are
very absorbed with issues that they feel will give them power and
control over others.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bullies often come from homes where there's little or no
supervision, with parents who are extremely tolerant and permissive
or physically aggressive or abusive themselves.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bullies often show little or no remorse for their actions,
they lack compassion and detest boundaries and limitations imposed
upon them by anyone in a position of authority. They also avoid
accountability and lie if it serves their purpose.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bullies often become aggressive adults and have significant
problems in establishing and maintaining healthy relationships
later in life.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the characteristics of victims include passivity,
shyness or acting as a loner. Victims may cry easily, feel that
they lack skills to be appropriately assertive and don't do well
dodging conflict with verbal tactics such as humor. A smaller
percent of victims tend to be ``provocative victims'' _ children
who are often somewhat impulsive, easily aroused emotionally and
may taunt and tease the bully into action.
</P>
<P>
   Victims of bullying are understandably unhappy and often suffer
from fear, anxiety and low self-esteem as a result of being
bullied. They may develop an aversion to situations where bullies
are found, such as school.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Q: I would like to know how I could get a copy of a newspaper
write-up on the moon landing in July 1969, especially the picture
of Buzz Aldrin standing on the moon's surface with the American
flag reflected on his helmet faceplate. I'd like the New York
Times, Chicago Sun-Times, the Austin American-Statesman or any
large city paper. Also, I'd like to know where I could get a poster
of that famous shot of Buzz Aldrin. _ Betty Jameson
</P>
<P>
   A: The famous date is July 20, 1969. The 16-by-20-inch poster,
available from NASA by calling (281) 283-7715, is less than $5. The
newspaper edition is a bit harder to find. Originals may be
available from anydate.com at (800) 653-9174, but requests for this
date are numerous. An original front page may cost several hundred
dollars. Reproductions (full-size, complete issues on traditional
newsprint) are more affordable ($14.95) and always available.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am concerned about a convenience store in my neighborhood.
This store sells alcohol and tobacco to underaged youths on a
regular basis. I have witnessed this several times and have never
seen anyone asked for identification. To whom can I report this? _
J.E.L.
</P>
<P>
   A: Report suspicious sales to the Texas Alcoholic Beverage
Commission at (888) THE-TABC (843-8222) and the Texas Tobacco
Prevention hot line at (800) 345-8647. You may be asked to give
your name, phone number and mailing address, but you can make an
anonymous report.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I need an ironing board cover for an ironing board that is
built into the wall. The length of the board is 42 inches. I have
found covers for table-top boards, but they are too small. If you
are able to direct me to a store that sells these, I would be so
grateful.
</P>
<P>
   _ Linda Hall
</P>
<P>
   A: The Container Store stocks an All-in-One Cover and Pad
($8.99) that should fit your 42-inch board. Another source is
Hide-a-Board Ironing Center (maker of a complete hidden board
unit). Covers ($10.50) are available by calling (800) 873-4766. Q:
In the past few weeks traffic helicopters _ at least, I hope they
are traffic helicopters _ have been buzzing over our home early
every weekday morning. Is there a regulation on where they can fly
and how close to the ground? _ P.X.A.
</P>
<P>
   A: Helicopters are regulated by the FAA, says agency spokesman
Stephen Homer. The regulation is vague (at best): ``Helicopters may
be operated at less than the minimums (altitudes) if the operation
is conducted without hazard to persons or property on the
surface.'' Sounds like carte blanche to me. If you feel these early
morning fliers are not operating ``without hazard,'' contact the
FAA Flight Standards District office at (800) 322-7873 or 10100
Reunion Place, Suite 200, San Antonio, TX 78216, Attn.: Operations
Unit. Give the copter's registration number (check the tail), as
well as the date, location and time of operation. A video or
photograph of the flight path would help.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was issued shares of a private corporation as compensation
for my sweat equity. Since the time I left employment, the
corporation has accepted a merger agreement. The other company
states only half of my shares are valid, even though I have the
full amount of the original certificates in my possession. I feel I
am wronged and need to know who to turn to for help. _ E.T.
</P>
<P>
   A: Sweat equity, readers, refers to company shares purchased
with deeds rather than dough. It is rare that a merger agreement
exchanges stock one for one. Before you take action, obtain a copy
of the certificate of merger from the secretary of state. The stock
exchange rate will be clearly stated, says Mike Dunn, corporate
finance attorney at Brobeck, Phleger &AMP; Harrison. Feeling
shortchanged after reading it? Pen a letter to the acquiring
company detailing the problem. Still not happy? Hire an attorney
with impressive letterhead to plead your case.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am invited to Thanksgiving dinner and am cooking a turkey
(a real one _ not a relative). The gathering is north of Dallas.
How do I cook it on Wednesday and safely transport it in the car
for more than four hoursThursday? If I arrive with a ptomaine
treat, I won't be invited back. _ C.W.
</P>
<P>
   A: Here is advice from the folks at the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's Meat and Poultry hot line. Save their number for
future fowl fixes: (800) 535-4555. Cook the turkey thoroughly
Wednesday evening. Cool for 20 minutes. Remove the stuffing and
carve the bird into sections (legs, wings, two breast sections).
Refrigerate turkey in portions, not whole. On Thanksgiving morning,
ice the sections in a cooler for the trip. When you arrive, wrap
the sections in foil, add gravy or broth, and reheat in a
325-plus-degree oven (10-15 minutes per pound or until steaming
hot) before devouring.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I applied for citizenship in July 1998 (I'm originally from
England); at the time my son was 10 years old and I was informed I
did not need to apply for him. He would automatically become a
citizen when I did. I had my fingerprints taken in January and have
heard nothing since (there is a big backlog due to staff shortages,
etc.). What happens if my son reaches the age of 12 before I become
a citizen? Would I then have to start an application for him? Is
there a specific age when you have to make a separate application
for a child? I can't seem to get through to the right department at
the Immigration and Naturalization Service to find out. _ Lorraine
E.
</P>
<P>
   A: Relax, Lorraine, you have time.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration and Naturalization spokesman Ray Dudley says a child
``who is a lawful permanent resident and under 18 years of age and
unmarried may automatically derive citizenship through a parent if
the parent becomes lawful citizen.'' Is the father a citizen? If he
is, the child is already a citizen and need only fill out an N600
form, application for a certificate of citizenship. When you become
a citizen, file an N600 for your son. For a form call (800)
870-3676 or download free forms at www.ins.usdoj.gov/. For more
information, call INS at (210) 967-7064 in San Antonio or try _ and
I know it is frustrating _ (800) 375-5283. That number is always
busy because it receives approximately 1,700 calls an hour. Whew!
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it time to take our hummingbird feeders up? _ Susan Patton
</P>
<P>
   A: Depends on which camp you follow. Some bird lovers wait until
they have not seen a hummingbird at the feeder for 10 days before
storing it for the winter. Other birders leave the feeders out
since some hummingbirds choose to winter in Central Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why does one not have to sign a receipt or enter a personal
code when using a credit card at an automated gasoline pump? If I
use a credit card at an ATM, I enter a personal code. At a
department store, I sign the receipt. At an automated pump, I need
not do either. At the same station, if I pay inside, I sign a
receipt. How is it that credit card companies allow gasoline pumps
to not use any verification?
</P>
<P>
   _ Chip Wolfe
</P>
<P>
   A: The credit card companies consider this type of at-the-pump
transaction to be the same as those conducted over the telephone or
Internet. No signature on either type of line. Visa spokesperson
Tiffany Hilton says the company relies on its fraud detection
system to catch unauthorized use.
</P>
<P>

   _ Speaking of birds ... Are you interested in Project Feeder
Watch sponsored by Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology? This
winterlong survey of North American birds is conducted every year
by thousands of bird-feeder watchers. About 43 percent of U.S.

unit). Covers ($10.50) are available by calling (800) 873-4766. Q:
In the past few weeks traffic helicopters _ at least, I hope they
are traffic helicopters _ have been buzzing over our home early
every weekday morning. Is there a regulation on where they can fly
and how close to the ground? _ P.X.A.
</P>
<P>
   A: Helicopters are regulated by the FAA, says agency spokesman
Stephen Homer. The regulation is vague (at best): ``Helicopters may
be operated at less than the minimums (altitudes) if the operation
is conducted without hazard to persons or property on the
surface.'' Sounds like carte blanche to me. If you feel these early
morning fliers are not operating ``without hazard,'' contact the
FAA Flight Standards District office at (800) 322-7873 or 10100
Reunion Place, Suite 200, San Antonio, TX 78216, Attn.: Operations
Unit. Give the copter's registration number (check the tail), as
well as the date, location and time of operation. A video or
photograph of the flight path would help.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was issued shares of a private corporation as compensation
for my sweat equity. Since the time I left employment, the
corporation has accepted a merger agreement. The other company
states only half of my shares are valid, even though I have the
full amount of the original certificates in my possession. I feel I
am wronged and need to know who to turn to for help. _ E.T.
</P>
<P>
   A: Sweat equity, readers, refers to company shares purchased
with deeds rather than dough. It is rare that a merger agreement
exchanges stock one for one. Before you take action, obtain a copy
of the certificate of merger from the secretary of state. The stock
exchange rate will be clearly stated, says Mike Dunn, corporate
finance attorney at Brobeck, Phleger &AMP; Harrison. Feeling
shortchanged after reading it? Pen a letter to the acquiring
company detailing the problem. Still not happy? Hire an attorney
with impressive letterhead to plead your case.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am invited to Thanksgiving dinner and am cooking a turkey
(a real one _ not a relative). The gathering is north of Dallas.
How do I cook it on Wednesday and safely transport it in the car
for more than four hoursThursday? If I arrive with a ptomaine
treat, I won't be invited back. _ C.W.
</P>
<P>
   A: Here is advice from the folks at the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's Meat and Poultry hot line. Save their number for
future fowl fixes: (800) 535-4555. Cook the turkey thoroughly
Wednesday evening. Cool for 20 minutes. Remove the stuffing and
carve the bird into sections (legs, wings, two breast sections).
Refrigerate turkey in portions, not whole. On Thanksgiving morning,
ice the sections in a cooler for the trip. When you arrive, wrap
the sections in foil, add gravy or broth, and reheat in a
325-plus-degree oven (10-15 minutes per pound or until steaming
hot) before devouring.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I applied for citizenship in July 1998 (I'm originally from
England); at the time my son was 10 years old and I was informed I
did not need to apply for him. He would automatically become a
citizen when I did. I had my fingerprints taken in January and have
heard nothing since (there is a big backlog due to staff shortages,
etc.). What happens if my son reaches the age of 12 before I become
a citizen? Would I then have to start an application for him? Is
there a specific age when you have to make a separate application
for a child? I can't seem to get through to the right department at
the Immigration and Naturalization Service to find out. _ Lorraine
E.
</P>
<P>
   A: Relax, Lorraine, you have time.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration and Naturalization spokesman Ray Dudley says a child
``who is a lawful permanent resident and under 18 years of age and
unmarried may automatically derive citizenship through a parent if
the parent becomes lawful citizen.'' Is the father a citizen? If he
is, the child is already a citizen and need only fill out an N600
form, application for a certificate of citizenship. When you become
a citizen, file an N600 for your son. For a form call (800)
870-3676 or download free forms at www.ins.usdoj.gov/. For more
information, call INS at (210) 967-7064 in San Antonio or try _ and
I know it is frustrating _ (800) 375-5283. That number is always
busy because it receives approximately 1,700 calls an hour. Whew!
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it time to take our hummingbird feeders up? _ Susan Patton
</P>
<P>
   A: Depends on which camp you follow. Some bird lovers wait until
they have not seen a hummingbird at the feeder for 10 days before
storing it for the winter. Other birders leave the feeders out
since some hummingbirds choose to winter in Central Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why does one not have to sign a receipt or enter a personal
code when using a credit card at an automated gasoline pump? If I
use a credit card at an ATM, I enter a personal code. At a
department store, I sign the receipt. At an automated pump, I need
not do either. At the same station, if I pay inside, I sign a
receipt. How is it that credit card companies allow gasoline pumps
to not use any verification?
</P>
<P>
   _ Chip Wolfe
</P>
<P>
   A: The credit card companies consider this type of at-the-pump
transaction to be the same as those conducted over the telephone or
Internet. No signature on either type of line. Visa spokesperson
Tiffany Hilton says the company relies on its fraud detection
system to catch unauthorized use.
</P>
<P>

Watch sponsored by Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology? This

 &HT;    Keeping car on the road and out of casket a challenge
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ It's an open-and-shut case of vehicular
homicide. A guy in Morenci, Mich., is standing trial for committing
a crime that most of us, at one time or another, have seriously
contemplated. He shot his transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The accused admits to firing four shotgun blasts into his pickup
truck
</P>
<P>
   because, despite continuous repairs, the stupid thing still
wouldn't start.
</P>
<P>
   The victim was parked only 30 feet from the perpetrator's house
and therein lies the rub _ the law says you can't kill your car
within 150 yards of a
</P>
<P>
   residence.
</P>
<P>
   Americans invest an amazing amount of emotion in their cars,
kind of a
</P>
<P>
   love-hate thing, so it shouldn't come as a surprise when
somebody decides to
</P>
<P>
   blow one away. All of us at one time or another have cursed our
cars for real
</P>
<P>
   or imagined slights, and threatened to drive them into the lake
_ or bay, or
</P>
<P>
   whatever's handy. We even define ``mixed emotions'' as watching
our
</P>
<P>
   mother-in-law drive off a cliff in our new Cadillac.
</P>
<P>
   My father, who lived to be 93, had a lifetime of seriously
ambivalent
</P>
<P>
   relationships with automobiles. It apparently began in 1924,
when he and my mother, newly married, were living in New York City.
Daddy decided it was time for them to own a car. In fact, he
already had one in mind _ a shiny black coupe he'd been eyeballing
in the Ford dealer's window.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of days later and a few hundred dollars lighter, Mother
and Daddy drove their new car out of the showroom and headed for
the countryside. Barely two minutes into the jaunt, it quit running
_ right in the middle of a bridge. Every attempt to coax it back
into life was a failure that frustrated my father even more.
Finally, he walked around to the passenger's door and helped my
</P>
<P>
   mother out. They hoofed it back to the Ford place where my
father handed the stunned salesman the keys, asked for his check
back, and told them where they could find their car.
</P>
<P>
   Late in 1940, Daddy bought my mother a new Chevy for Christmas.
I went with him to pick it up. It was a Super DeLuxe, two-tone blue
and gray, 4-door sedan. He wrote the dealer a check for $795 and we
took it home. By the following Christmas, the country was at war
and there was not a new car to be had. Automobile manufacturers
retooled and soon tanks instead of convertibles were
</P>
<P>
   rolling off the assembly lines.
</P>
<P>
   One snowy day about midway into the war, Mother and I were
driving across
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's high-level bridge when her Christmas present dropped
its left rear
</P>
<P>
   fender. She said it was too dangerous to try to stop and pick it
up, so we drove on. A few minutes later we pulled into the
underground parking lot at the Terminal Tower Building where my
father was waiting for us.
</P>
<P>
   Mother slid over as Daddy came around to the driver's side. He
opened the door, tossed his hat and briefcase on the back seat,
kissed my mother and me, and in a purely conversational tone asked,
``Doris, had you noticed the left-rear fender is gone?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, Harry, I had. It's on the high-level bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What is it doing there?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably getting run over.'' End of discussion.
</P>
<P>
   That evening at dinner, Daddy casually asked mother if she'd
call the Chevy dealer the next morning and have him see if he could
scare up a couple of fenders for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why two?'' my mother asked, obviously surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because, Doris,'' my father explained, ``when I kicked the
damned thing
</P>
<P>
   another one fell off.''
</P>
<P>
   There were, of course, no new fenders to be had, but it really
didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   The next week somebody stole our two front tires.

   NATIONAL NEWS (``a'' category)
</P>
<P>
   ENVIRONMENTAL-ACTIVISTS (Albany, N.Y.) _ With smoke spewing from
factories and waterways bubbling with chemicals, the 1970s were a
decade of awakening, when citizens stepped outside and saw
ecological destruction from their doorsteps. Nowhere was that
awareness greater than on college campuses, including the State
University of New York at Albany, where an activist curriculum and
environmental club had local and national impact. By DINA
CAPPIELLO.
</P>
<P>
   CHINESE-ROOTS (San Francisco) _ Seventeen-year-old Jason Lew is
one of 10 Chinese Americans reconnecting with their families'
homeland through ``In Search of Roots,'' a yearlong program of
research and study sponsored by the Chinese Culture Center of San
Francisco, the Chinese Historical Society of America and the
Overseas Chinese Affairs office in Guangdong province of the
People's Republic of China. By ANDREA WOO.
</P>
<P>
   SCIENCE-UCSF (San Francisco) _ When the U.S. Human Genome
Project was launched in 1990, the University of California at San
Francisco did not join the international effort to map the
estimated 100,000 genes in human DNA. UCSF scientists were a
natural fit for the Human Genome Project, but the project couldn't
fit in UCSF. There simply wasn't enough laboratory space. That will
change with the construction of UCSF's new 43-acre research campus.
By SARAH YANG.

<P>
   JUSTICE-SURVEY (Schenectady, N.Y.) _ Nearly a decade of
tabloid-friendly court dramas, from the trial of William Kennedy
Smith to that of William Jefferson Clinton, have caused a massive
decline in the public's faith in the justice system, according to a
Union College study released last week. By ANDREW BROWNSTEIN.

   MEXICO-ELECTION (Mexico City) _ In previous election years,
Francisco Labastida would have been all but certain to become the

Institutional Revolutionary Party's first primary race on Nov. 7,
and there are three other politicians competing against Labastida.

a new model, ``Sugar,'' which he describes as a ''happy little
bike,'' that is just hitting the stores. By VICTORIA COLLIVER.
</P>
<P>
   JACK-O'-LANTERNS (Undated) _ Pumpkins are as American as apple
pie, but jack-o'-lanterns migrated here from Ireland. If you are
not good at carving, or don't like the mess of scooping out the
pulp and seeds, try painting your pumpkin. And remember: Pumpkins
also make great decorative accessories. By FRANCES INGRAHAM HEINS.

<P>
   DAVID-CARRADINE (Rhinebeck, N.Y.) _ At the Omega Institute, a

was making his debut. The actor best know for his role in the 1970s
cult-hit ``Kung Fu'' was starring in a new role: leading a workshop
on the inner roots of tai chi, a centuries-old Chinese fitness and
health practice sometimes described as meditation in motion. By
DOUG BLACKBURN.

   BANK-Y2K (Albany, N.Y.) _ Planning to make a large cash

most likely get an earful before you get your money. The bank is
one of hundreds that has made tellers the last defense against
people emptying their bank accounts due to the Y2K computer
problem. Doing all they can to eradicate Y2K fears, banks are
training their staff to watch for uncharacteristically large cash
withdrawals. By ALAN WECHSLER.

   BBA-RATTO-COLUMN (Altanta) _ Well, if the team of the decade
thing doesn't work out for them, maybe the Atlanta Braves can try
not to be confused with the San Diego Padres. Sunday's 7-2 loss to
the New York Yankees marked the first time since the Braves started
dominating the National League that they looked unworthy of their
place. By RAY RATTO.
</P>
<P>
   FBN-49ERS (Minneapolis) _ The 49ers defensive line doesn't know
what to say anymore. Each week, they line up prepared to chase
after opposing quarterbacks. Each week, they're left to wonder why
a front four can be walled off so easily and so often. The team's
40-16 loss to the Minnesota Vikings only added to the mystery. By
JEFFRI CHADIHA.
</P>
<P>
   FBM-RAIDERS (Oakland, Calif.) _ Perhaps it's some sort of cosmic
justice that Oakland regaled in a 24-23 victory over the New York
Jets Sunday evening, because for the better part of three quarters,
there wasn't much taking place at the Coliseum to suggest victory
was at hand. By MICHELLE SMITH.
</P>
<P>
   OUTDOORS-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ With each cast of my fly rod,
the river seemed full of hope, challenge and reward. I worked my
way thigh deep across from a riffle, then whipped the line
back-and-forth twice and delivered it gently into the run.
Everything was just right, a perfect spot. A big steelhead must be
here, I thought, maybe several. By TOM STEINSTRA.

   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ My local bookstore has shelves of
relationship books with titles like ``Women Can't Hear What Men
Don't Say,'' ``It's a Jungle Out There, Jane'' and even ``Verbal
Abuse Survivors Speak Out.'' I couldn't find a book on the most
important kind of relationship in the Bay Area, the one between
homeowner and contractor. By ROB MORSE.
</P>
<P>
   ROSENFELD-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y.) _ The words of the New York
Constitution proscribe casino gambling in the state. The document
also spells out the kinds of gambling that are permissible _ Lotto,
pari-mutuel racing, charitable bingo, among others _ and additional
rules to keep the gambling that is allowed from becoming
commercialized. Despite the constitutional restrictions, Indian
casino gambling has been established in two locations in the state
and there is a push to set up a third. By HARRY ROSENFELD.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Feeling the loss of Jean Shepherd
 &HT;    (Resending for Cincinnati Enquirer; attention Peter Bronson.)
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jean Shepherd helped to rear me during a couple of pivotal years
in my early adolescence, but don't blame him for the outcome. He
didn't know he was implicated.
</P>
<P>
   Shepherd was, I guess you would have to say, a radio
personality, but without the connotations of vacuity, political
demagoguery or social loutishness that now so often adhere to the
term. He was instead creative and engagingly cultured in a causal
Midwestern way, and he carried a quiet, refracted wit familiarly,
like a valise that had been around.
</P>
<P>
   I listened to Shepherd on WSAI in Cincinnati in _ oh, I'm not
sure: around 1950. Within a few years he was in the big time in New
York City, where the big time is.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to doing his radio shows, Shepherd wrote books with
whimsical titles like ``Wanda Hickey's Night of Golden Memories and
Other Disasters.'' He wrote movies, too. One, ``A Christmas
Story,'' seemed to catch up my own Ohio boyhood uncannily, right
down to the forlorn yearning I had shared with its 9-year-old
Ralphie Parker for a Daisy Red Ryder BB gun.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall McLuhan once characterized Shepherd as a radio
novelist. Maybe so. He was a storyteller certainly but at his best
he was more. A fabulist, say.
</P>
<P>
   In Cincinnati, Shepherd disc-jockeyed an afternoon program of
offbeat pop, jazz and classical recordings that would never get
anywhere near the Hit Parade. He led me to the Bunny Berrigan
trumpet solo that blows up like a sudden heat storm midway through
the vocal goo of Tommy Dorsey's ``Marie.'' To hear that flash of
brass lightning at just exactly the moment you are ready for it is
. . . well, I don't want to make too much of this, but I still
listen to the solo every few months. It is my true north.
</P>
<P>
   It was in his late-night show, with room for his improvised
musings, that Shepherd came most tellingly into his own. I was
supposed to be asleep but I would turn my bedside table radio low
and pull the blanket up over it, and over me, to dampen the sound
and I would listen into the small hours.
</P>
<P>
   There were wistful monologues, and meditations on music. And
Shepherd would imagine surreal scenes in careful detail _ Toscanini
conducting a symphony orchestra in a flat Kansas cornfield beside a
lone railroad track. As a Kurt Weill song sensibly counsels, ``O,
don't ask why.''
</P>
<P>
   He broadcast for a while, improbably, from a restaurant called
Shuller's Wigwam. Every night a fellow would come in, or so
Shepherd said, dressed in a three-button charcoal suit and carrying
a black umbrella. He would order onion soup. Shepherd would imagine
the diner's thoughts as he methodically spooned his way through the
soup. The man in the three-button charcoal suit never spoke.
</P>
<P>
   Shepherd had a taste for words. He savored them like
butterballs. There was a sweetness to his rambles around the human
condition, saved from surfeit by a ready sense of irony and a
distancing bemusement.
</P>
<P>
   Shepherd died a few days ago, long since replaced as a tutor to
today's adolescents by MTV. Their loss.

   At Halloween, the boys are always dressed as cowboys, pirates,
soldiers, spacemen and monsters. They become little men of action
or powerful, terrifying monsters. They fantasize dominance. Little
girls are princesses, fairies, brides and angels. In their glitter
and flounces, the girls join the time-honored tradition of helpless
loveliness. It seems that for children, nothing much has changed in
spite of the women's movement, men's groups, the Age of Aquarius
and guys doing dishes. How have girls and boys remained so
untouched by all the years of social upheaval? A thoughtful and

 &UR; By BOB BERMAN &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   October can be eerie, all right. Down on Earth the chill winds
blow and the fall colors vanish, replaced by stark, barren
branches. In the sky too, it's a perfectly spooky month _ the ideal
backdrop for the autumn night when the most people roam beneath the
stars: Halloween. In this feature from Discover magazine, Bob
Berman, author of ``Secrets of the Night Sky'' (HarperPerennial
Books), reports on what can be seen in the night sky on spook
night, and how celestial objects tie in to the history of
Halloween. (Slugged: BC-HALLOWEEN-FRIGHT-NIGHT-ART-NYTSF, category

   October can be eerie, all right. Down on Earth the chill winds
blow and the fall colors vanish, replaced by stark, barren
branches. In the sky too, it's a perfectly spooky month _ the ideal
backdrop for the autumn night when the most people roam beneath the
stars: Halloween. In this feature from Discover magazine, Bob
Berman, author of ``Secrets of the Night Sky'' (HarperPerennial
Books), reports on what can be seen in the night sky on spook
night, and how celestial objects tie in to the history of
Halloween. (Slugged: BC-HALLOWEEN-FRIGHT-NIGHT-ART-NYTSF, category

   October can be eerie, all right. Down on Earth the chill winds
blow and the fall colors vanish, replaced by stark, barren
branches.
</P>
<P>
   In the sky too, it's a perfectly spooky month _ the ideal
backdrop for the autumn night when the most people roam beneath the
stars: Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   The month begins creepily enough. Nightfall finds Scorpius the
Scorpion slithering downward into the southwestern horizon. Draco
the Dragon hangs high in the northwest, and low in the west stands
Bovtes (pronounced boo!-o-teez). The sky's eeriest props are in
place.
</P>
<P>
   But the celestial object most intimately connected with devils
and witches waits until mid-month to rise at nightfall, so that by
Halloween it's well up when darkness comes. It's the Pleiades.
</P>
<P>
   What? That close-knit cluster of young suns better known as the
Seven Sisters? What have they to do with sinister things?
</P>
<P>
   In the Western world, everything. Halloween revolves around
them.
</P>
<P>
   Even without Halloween, other cultures attached significance to
the Pleiades. The Brahmans of ancient India visualized those stars
as the sparks of Agni, the god of fire. In Greek legend they were
the daughters of Atlas. The Pleiades are even mentioned in the Book
of Job:
</P>
<P>
   Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the
bands of Orion?
</P>
<P>
   A ``sweet influence'' is hardly scary. But some cultures
associated the Pleiades with more ominous occasions.
</P>
<P>
   The Aztecs, for example, linked the date when the constellation
reached its highest point, or culminated, at midnight with the end
of the world. The Aztecs believed that every 52 years, when their
365-day sun calendar and 260-day ritual calendar came into
coincidence, the possibility existed that the heavens would cease
to move and demons would fall from the sky.
</P>
<P>
   The sign that this catastrophe wouldn't befall the cosmos? When
the Pleiades reached their zenith at midnight (almost straight
overhead in Mexico City) and then continued harmlessly across the
sky.
</P>
<P>
   The Aztec ceremony associated with this event involved a human
sacrifice. That's certainly creepy but has nothing to do with
Halloween. For that, we must look to the Celts.
</P>
<P>
   Many historians believe Halloween is the modern-day remnant of a
Celtic celebration called Samhain, which marked the end of the
Celtic year and the transition from summer to winter.
</P>
<P>
   The Celts believed that during Samhain, the border between this
world and the supernatural world cracked open, granting free
passage to sinister fairies from the land of the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Samhain fell at the midpoint between the autumnal equinox and
the winter solstice, and the Celts originally knew when that was
because it took place at the same time that _ you guessed it _ the
Pleiades culminated at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The tradition, developed in the Middle Ages, of the Witches'
Sabbath on Oct. 31 is probably rooted in the old Celtic observance.
That date was upheld into modern times as All Hallows' Eve, which
became, of course, Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   Now is your chance to get closer to the power behind the goblins
and mischief of October's final night. The Pleiades are striking to
the unaided eye, but they become stunning through binoculars.
Instantly the six to 11 naked-eye stars grow to hundreds of
sapphire jewels.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomy clubs periodically hold observing nights for the
public. Perhaps some will set up instruments on Halloween, so
families _ already outdoors on their diabolic rounds _ can bravely
meet October's ghostly apparitions face-to-face.

SCARE TACTICS: A HALLOWEEN QUIZ FOR FRIGHT-FLICK FANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Includes a color slide of Anthony Hopkins in a scene from ``The
Silence of the Lambs.'') 
 By S. BURELISON  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Wall paintings dating from 3000 B.C., depicting evil figures and
piles of skeletons, suggest that people back then loved a good
scare.
 &HT;    Since then, it's been the same story: The ancient Greeks traded
tales of flesh-eating creatures, and the second-century Roman
author Pliny wrote about haunted houses.
 &HT;    But horror stories took on a whole new life _ or living death? _
with the invention of the motion picture.
 &HT;    The earliest film pioneers didn't have to stage spooky scenarios
to frighten their audiences _ merely watching moving pictures was
pretty scary to most people a century ago. When Paris viewers saw a
train speed toward them for the first time in 1895's one-scene
movie ``L'Arrivee d'un Train a la Crotat,'' many ran screaming for
the nearest exit.
 &HT;    Advances in movie technology enabled filmmakers to show us the
demons that the storytellers couldn't, but _ as ``The Blair Witch
Project'' (1999) demonstrated all over again _ sometimes the unseen
is more frightening. Alfred Hitchcock, hailed as ``the master of
suspense,'' said he believed in ``putting the horror in the mind of
the audience,'' not on the screen.
 &HT;    In a way, he was following in the footsteps of those ancient
Greeks, as have filmmakers through the decades, whether their films
were elegantly ambiguous or stomach-turningly graphic.
 &HT;    How well do you remember these films that gave viewers the feel
of reel terror? 
 -0- 
 TEST YOUR TERROR QUOTIENT  
 &HT;    1. Besides rats and armadillos, who shares the count's
Transylvanian castle in ``Dracula'' (1931)?
 &HT;    2. What is the name of Dr. Frankenstein's hunchbacked assistant,
who steals an ``abnormal'' brain for his boss in ``Frankenstein''
(1931)?
 &HT;    3. Why was Imhotep, title character in ``The Mummy'' (1932),
buried alive in the first place?
 &HT;    4. The East Indian drug monocane transforms scientist Jack
Griffin into ... who?
 &HT;    5. You too may succumb to lycanthropy, like ``The Wolfman''
(1941), if you have a certain mark on your palm. What mark is it?
 &HT;    6. Graf Orlok, the title character in ``Nosferatu'' (1922), is
far uglier than Dracula. And, unlike his more famous counterpart,
he doesn't perish by a stake through the heart. What destroys him?
 &HT;    7. Like, this guy Merrick (Donald Sutherland) shows up and tells
what title teen that she has to, like, stop some kind of dark evil
forces instead of going to the mall?
 &HT;    8. According to Armand (Antonio Banderas) in ``Interview With
the Vampire'' (1994), what is the only act that is considered a
crime among his fellow neck-nibblers?
 &HT;    9. What is the name of the possessed estate that is explored in
``The Haunting'' (1963)?
 &HT;    10. ``The House on Haunted Hill'' (1958), ruled by Vincent
Price, has a particularly distinctive amenity in the basement. What
is it?
 &HT;    11. What gift enables little Danny Torrence (Danny Lloyd) to
foresee horror in room 237 of the Overlook Hotel?
 &HT;    12. What is kept in ``The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari'' (1919)?
 &HT;    13. Who teaches the Monster (Boris Karloff) to speak in ``Bride
of Frankenstein'' (1935)?
 &HT;    14. According to the advertisements, medical student Herbert
West (Jeffrey Combs) ``has a very good head on his shoulders _ and
another one in a dish on his desk.'' What film was being
advertised?
 &HT;    15. ``The Tingler'' (1959) looks like a lobster tail with little
legs, but Dr. Chapin (Vincent Price) says it's fear incarnate, and
can be escaped in only one way. How?
 &HT;    16. What two words appear on the stomach of poor, possessed
Regan (Linda Blair) before ``The Exorcist'' (1973) shows up?
 &HT;    17. Guy (John Cassavetes) agrees to allow ``Rosemary's Baby''
(1968) to be Satan's son in exchange for what?
 &HT;    18. What's the significance of the license plate ``CQB 241?''
 &HT;    19. In ``The Night of the Living Dead'' (1968), what are the
only two ways to kill the man-eating zombies?
 &HT;    20. According to the catchy slogan for ``Motel Hell'' (1980),
what does it take to produce Farmer Vincent's Fritters?
 &HT;    21. In ``The Silence of the Lambs'' (1991), what dead-giveaway
evidence does FBI Agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) spot that
reveals she's in the home of killer Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine)?
 &HT;    22. When does Michael Myers go on his first murderous rampage in
Smith's Grove, Ill.?
 &HT;    23. Gunnar Hansen portrayed what cut-up in the cult slasher film
``The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' (1974)?
 &HT;    24. Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) doesn't spend all his time in
the shower in ``Psycho'' (1960). What is his hobby?
 &HT;    25. What former child star is the first to die in ``Scream''
(1996)? 
 THE AWFUL TRUTH  
 &HT;    1. Dracula shares his abode with three ``brides,'' two brunettes
and a blonde _ who was usually Greta Garbo's stand-in. And yes,
there are indeed armadillos on the stairs.
 &HT;    2. I bet you said ``Igor,'' didn't you? Well, Frankenstein's
henchman is Fritz, played by Dwight Frye, who was often typecast as
a mad sidekick after his memorable 1931 portrayal of Dracula's
slave, Renfield.
 &HT;    3. Imhotep was punished for having used the Sacred Scroll of
Thoth to restore his beloved Princess Ankh-es-en-Amon to life.
 &HT;    4. Monocane makes Jack Griffin into ``The Invisible Man''
(1933), played by Claude Rains in his screen debut.
 &HT;    5. A pentagram _ a five-pointed star _ on your hand means that
you'd be best advised to beware of the full moon.
 &HT;    6. Orlok stands in front of a window at dawn, and the sunlight
dissolves him.
 &HT;    7. Merrick delivers his warning to ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer''
(1992), who continues her quest for the undead and the hottest new
styles on television.
 &HT;    8. The worst thing Anne Rice's vampires can do is to kill a
fellow vampire.
 &HT;    9. Hill House is explored in ``The Haunting'' and its 1999
remake, both based on Shirley Jackson's novel, ``The Haunting of
Hill House.''
 &HT;    10. Price's basement features an acid pit, bubbling with the
bones of its victims.
 &HT;    11. Danny has second sight, also known as ``The Shining''
(1980).
 &HT;    12. The mad doctor keeps his sleepwalking slave, Cesare (Conrad
Veidt), in his cabinet ... or so we think.
 &HT;    13. A blind hermit (O.P. Heggie) teaches the Monster to speak.
His first words are ``bread,'' ``good'' and ``friend,'' in that
order.
 &HT;    14. Herbert's experiments earn him _ and the 1985 film _ the
name ``Re-Animator.''
 &HT;    15. ``Scream,'' Price says, ``Scream for your lives!''
Apparently, expressing fear thwarts The Tingler.
 &HT;    16. Regan's abdomen reads ``help me.''
 &HT;    17. Rosemary's rotten hubby asks for, and receives, career
opportunities as an actor.
 &HT;    18. ``CQB 241'' is the license plate of the haunted 1958
Plymouth Fury in ``Christine'' (1983).
 &HT;    19. Only a shot or heavy blow to the head, destroying their
radiation-activated brains, can kill the Living Dead.
 &HT;    20. ``It takes all kinds of critters to make Farmer Vincent's
Fritters!'' _ including people fattened up and murdered by motel
owner Rory Calhoun.
 &HT;    21. Starling spots a death's-head moth. Actually, tomato
hornworms were used, made up to resemble the rare moth, which was
also pictured in the film's memorable poster, covering Foster's
mouth.
 &HT;    22. Myers' carnage occurs on ``Halloween'' (1978).
 &HT;    23. Gunnar Hansen played ``Leatherface,'' who wields the
chainsaw in the cult favorite.
 &HT;    24. Norman enjoys taxidermy _ his specialty is stuffing birds.
 &HT;    25. Trick question _ actually, no one. Casey Becker, played by
former child star Drew Barrymore, is actually the second ``Scream''
victim. The first, Casey's boyfriend, was not played by a former
child star.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Year after year I stand dutifully at my door dispensing
Halloween candy. And year after year I'm struck by the difference
between the fantasies of little boys and their female counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   The boys are always dressed as cowboys, pirates, soldiers,
spacemen, and monsters. When boys masquerade, they portray males
who do, who can. They become little men of action or powerful,
terrifying monsters. They fantasize dominance; if they can't
capture you, they'll eat you up. They also evince a peculiar
attraction for depicting mass murderers, serial killers and other
victims of an aberrant psychology.
</P>
<P>
   The girls show no such tendencies and their psyche seems
dominated by Walt Disney. They are princesses, fairies, brides, and
angels. In their glitter and flounces, the girls join the
time-honored tradition of helpless loveliness. Fairies are tiny.
The most potent thing they can do is be mischievous.
</P>
<P>
   And every time I ask a little girl if she's a queen, she assures
me she is actually a princess. Queens, I suppose, have a certain
authority and of course, they may not be pretty. They might be
evil, or heaven help us, old. Princesses on the other hand are
always gorgeous and need only wait for the appearance of princes.
Brides represent a perfect, passive ideal of beauty. And whoever
heard of an angel with much to dO but flutter around seraphically.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years ago, my mother saw boys and girls dressed in
precisely the same way. It seems that for children, nothing much
has changed in spite of the women's movement, men's groups, the Age
of Aquarius, and guys doing dishes. How have girls and boys
remained so untouched by all the years of social upheaval? Perhaps
they are not so much unaffected by that as more affected by
advertising, movies, and toys.
</P>
<P>
   Or is it some biological imperative that populates boy dreams
with superheroes, fanged werewolves, and blood sucking vampires,
while girls imagine being Miss America?
</P>
<P>
   If Halloween in my mid-American neighborhood is representative,
then today's girls want what females have always been allowed and
educated to want: to be not only beautiful, but more beautiful than
all the rest. Today's little girls may be free to wear pants to
school and join baseball teams, but it seems that when it comes to
expressing their fantasies, they still come out pink and pretty.
</P>
<P>
   One girl who came to my door took it one step further. She was
dressed as a French Maid, in a low cut, short-skirted black outfit
with a white apron and cap and a black velvet bow at her throat
that looked more like a dog collar than a decoration. This girl
opted not only for beauty, but for subjugation too.
</P>
<P>
   Is this ''you've come a long way, baby'' consciousness? If so,
where did we start and where are we going?
</P>
<P>
   There was one girl, a little woman after my own heart, who
bucked all the stereotypes for a while. She came to my door three
years in row in the same costume. She was dressed as a dinosaur,
Tyrannosaurs rex no less, and her bright-eyed hopeful face peered
out from between huge sharp teeth. I always gave her extra treats.
But last Halloween, she too came dressed as a princess.
</P>
<P>
   I must be honest. I do see an occasional kid, sex unknown,
dressed as a pumpkin or a mouse. I attribute these kinds of
artistic costumes to mothers with sewing skill, few outlets for
their creativity and kids too young to fight back. My mother did
that to me. Not having any idea of what I really wanted to be, she
made me clever costumes that I hated.
</P>
<P>
   I remember one year she dressed me in paper bags and made a
bird's nest, complete with bird, for me to wear in my hair. I was a
tree. I won a prize. I was miserable. I wanted beauty and glamour.
</P>
<P>
   Each year brings a few witches. None of these girls, however,
opt for an ugly crone-like visage _ no warts, wild hair, beaked
noses, or toad companions. Every witch I see is cute as a button.
There are a few gypsy women too, but as every girl worth her salt
knows, choosing to be a gypsy is just a sure-fire way to get
permission to put on a face full of makeup. The gypsy girls at my
door did not look free, mysterious, and exotic, but more like
Barbie run amuck.
</P>
<P>
   Where are all the Annie Oakley's, Amazon warriors, female
pirates and bandits supreme? Our newly revised histories tell us
there were plenty of them. Doesn't any girl want to dress up as
Joan of Arc? And where's the boy who dream of being an elf, a
Prince Charming, or a groom?
</P>
<P>
   My own sons, who are truly sweet and gentle boys, have always
chosen to be something disgusting risen from dead, and over the
years I've become as adept as a theatrical pro at creating scars,
wounds, and bloody mutilations.
</P>
<P>
   I keep asking myself why. I ask them, and they find my curiosity
vastly amusing. ''Because,'' they patiently explain to me, ''it's
fun.'' But I'm haunted by the question of why the girls don't want
to look dreadfully, wonderfully scary and horribly, terrifyingly
ugly.

   WASHINGTON _ Like leftovers sealed with a burp in a pink
Tupperware container, Brownie Wise's lifetime of documents were
recently preserved in the archives of the Smithsonian Institution's
Museum of American History.
</P>
<P>
   Brownie Wise, born the daughter of a Buford, Ga., plumber in
1913, had a considerable impact on the national culture. She
created the Tupperware party.
</P>
<P>
   Consider some ramifications of her creation:
</P>
<P>
   _ Somewhere in the world, a Tupperware party begins every 2.5
seconds. Nine out of every 10 American homes have at least one
piece of Tupperware.
</P>
<P>
   _ A company that was going broke trying to sell its plastic
containers in hardware stores half a century ago made $1.1 billion
in net sales last year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Most of this business was racked up by 950,000 ``independent
salespeople'' hawking the patented airtight containers to the 105
million people who attended Tupperware parties in the homes of
their friends and neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, a new book published by the Smithsonian contends
that the Tupperware party advanced the cause of feminism in the
1950s.
</P>
<P>
   With American men back from World War II, women had been pushed
back into the home and out of the jobs they had filled during the
war. Tupperware parties gave postwar housewives an outlet for their
economic ambitions, argues Alison J. Clarke, author of
``Tupperware: The Promise of Plastic in 1950s America.''
</P>
<P>
   As a divorced mother, Brownie Wise ``was very insightful and
sensitive to women's lives and lack of opportunity for
employment,'' explained Clarke in an interview. ``She herself
struggled throughout the '30s and '40s to find work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Smithsonian papers, pictures and movies from Wise and
Tupperware inventor Earl S. Tupper are the foundation for Clarke's
book and were archived last month. They are available to other
researchers. Curators are considering creating a Tupperware display
in the museum itself.
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   Wise, who died in 1992, created a cultural icon chiefly because
she understood _ and even embodied _ the American dream. She
preached and practiced a simple philosophy: ``There is nothing
wrong with wanting things.''
</P>
<P>
   Brownie Humphrey grew up poor in the South, wanting things that
her family could not afford. She met Robert Wise while attending
the Texas Centennial celebration in 1936. They married shortly
thereafter. With the Depression hard upon Dixie, the newlyweds lit
out for Detroit. Robert Wise found a job on a Ford assembly line.
</P>
<P>
   The union was unhappy and short-lived. Three years after the
birth of their only child, a son named Jerry, they divorced in
1941. By then, though, the industrious Brownie Wise had adopted the
pen name ``Hibiscus'' and was writing a column for women in the
Detroit News.
</P>
<P>
   In the column, ``Hibiscus'' was a transplanted Southern belle
who lived in a modern, well-furnished house called ``Lovehaven''
with her successful and adoring husband, ``Yankee,'' and their
infant son, ``Tiny Hands.'' The sentimental columns about marital
bliss and conspicuous consumption contrasted starkly with Wise's
actual circumstances. She and her son and been abandoned by Robert
Wise and were financially imperiled, according to the Smithsonian
book.
</P>
<P>
   To augment her writing income, Wise started selling Stanley Home
Products. The company employed former housewives as saleswomen and
encouraged them to push its wares through their social contacts.
</P>
<P>
   At about this same time, halfway across the country in
Leominster, Mass., a former DuPont chemical company employee named
Earl Tupper was trying to design plastic products for home use. In
1942, he invented a flexible plastic bowl with a ``non-snap'' lid
that could be sealed securely after the air inside the container
was released.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately aware of the possibilities for the product, the
fledgling inventor envisioned a ``Tupperization'' of the American
home. Spills and odors would be eliminated and leftovers exalted
through use of the lightweight plastic containers with the airtight
seal, he foresaw.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, America's housewives were unreceptive. Tupperware
arrived in stores in the late 1940s, after the war had ended, and
languished on shelves.
</P>
<P>
   After initially being hailed as the miracle material for the
future, plastic had disappointed many consumers by cracking or
being otherwise unreliable. Also, to be appreciated, the unique
Tupperware lid and ``burp'' had to be demonstrated, and store
clerks were not up to the job. Although heavily advertised in
magazines, by 1948 ``stacks of Tupperware collected dust on the
shelves of hardware stores across the United States,'' Clarke
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   However, in Detroit, Brownie Wise had discovered Tupperware. She
purchased some through a plastics dealer and began selling it along
with her line of Stanley Home Products. Indeed, Wise and a group of
saleswomen that she had organized as the Patio Parties team were
selling so much Tupperware that Earl Tupper summoned her to
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of meetings, Tupper decided to abandon all store
sales. He hired Wise to set up a national distribution system using
her ``hostess plan.'' A middle-aged, divorced mother with no formal
business training, Brownie Wise would head the newly formed
Tupperware Home Parties Inc. to sell the growing line of plastic
containers.
</P>
<P>
   The system was an immediate and spectacular success.
</P>
<P>
   Working on commissions, a Tupperware distributor _ almost always
a woman _ would recruit an acquaintance to invite friends and
neighbors to a party in her home. At this quasi-social affair, the
distributor would demonstrate Tupperware products and take orders.
The ``hostess'' received Tupperware ``gifts'' for providing the
home and customers.
</P>
<P>
   With young families filling new suburbs across America,
Tupperware parties quickly became a national institution.
</P>
<P>
   Without the parties, said Clarke, ``Tupperware would have been a
design failure _ for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   Although still single, Brownie Wise abruptly began living a
flamboyant Southern lifestyle similar to the one she had envisioned
in her ``Hibiscus'' column. Corporate headquarters for Tupperware
Home Parties would be a gleaming white building surrounded by 1,000
acres of gardens and lakes on the Orange Blossom Trail near
Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Wise's own lakeside mansion in nearby Kissimmee was filled with
the ``modern'' furniture of the '50s. There was an indoor swimming
pool and a cabin cruiser docked out back.
</P>
<P>
   She drove a ``Tupperware Rose''-colored convertible and kept a
matching pink canary caged in her office.
</P>
<P>
   The Smithsonian book describes how Wise was asked by a women's
magazine if she had considered remarriage. ``Why should I?'' she
replied. ``My work provides me with all the fun, excitement and
emotional outlets I could ever want. ... It enables me to give
other women in financial trouble the same chance I had to help
themselves to happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1954, she became the first woman to appear on the cover of
``Business Week.'' The key to Tupperware's success was the women
who recruited ``hostesses'' and enthusiastically demonstrated the
product at parties, she told the magazine. ``If we build the
people, they'll build the business,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For motivation, she invited top distributors to elaborate
Homecoming Jubilees. At the 1954 event, Wise dressed in Western
garb and invited distributors to ``dig for gold'' on the grounds of
the company's Florida headquarters. Issued shovels, the women dug
out buried mink stoles, diamond rings and other loot _ including a
toy car to be exchanged for a real one.
</P>
<P>
   The 1957 Homecoming Jubilee featured a ``wish fairy'' _ complete
with tiara and magic wand _ who granted the wishes of top
saleswomen.
</P>
<P>
   Wise reveled in the glamour and materialism. But Earl Tupper, a
stern New Englander, thought such displays showed bad taste. He
thought the publicity about the parties and Jubilees was
overshadowing the product itself, Clarke wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In 1958, Wise left Tupperware with a $30,000 separation payment
for what was called ``semi-retirement.'' The details of her
departure were never announced to the public or even to her
party-giving saleswomen.
</P>
<P>
   Later that same year, the Tupper Corp. and Tupperware Home
Parties Inc. were sold to the Rexall Drug Co. for $16 million.
</P>
<P>
   Wise stayed near Kissimmee and worked as a marketing consultant
for several cosmetics firms. She died at the age of 79 in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Part of her legacy is the Museum of Historic Food Containers
near Orlando. Created by Wise in the 1950s as the Museum of Dishes,
the facility traces the history of cooking and food storage from
Egyptian earthenware from 4000 B.C. to, well, Tupperware.

BIKE CRUSADER GIVES HIS PRODUCTS PERSONAL ATTENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANSELMO, Calif. _ Watching Gary Fisher try to contain his
6-foot-1-inch, 160-pound frame within the confines of a chair, it
becomes quite obvious he's more comfortable in motion.
</P>
<P>
   The man widely recognized as one of the founding fathers of the
mountain bike keeps sliding off the chair in his San Anselmo living
room and twisting his lanky limbs into in various positions as he
talks about his work, his philosophies on transportation and the
history of the brand that bears his name.
</P>
<P>
   His new model ``Sugar,'' which he describes as a ``happy little
bike,'' is just hitting the stores. And Fisher, who will turn 49 on
Nov. 5, has been training steadily for the past three years _
essentially living his product's lifestyle and winning races in his
age group, both in national and international competitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went a long ways in reinventing myself,'' Fisher said of
his return to racing. ``Down in my soul, I was a biker, but you
still have to prove yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   To bike fans, who see Fisher as an icon of sorts, he doesn't
have much to prove. He gets plenty of mileage off his history. He
helped turn a rogue activity started by a group of bikers in the
1970s _ simply riding beat-up bikes down Mount Tamalpais in
Northern California _ into a bona fide sport.
</P>
<P>
   That involved taking the old bikes _ which they called clunkers,
ballooners or beater bikes _ and turning them into something that
could not only ride down the mountain better, but go up the
mountain as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``What made it revolutionary is that high tech came to heavy
duty,'' he said, explaining how in 1974 he first made a bike with a
wide gear range and strong brakes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, after making all-terrain bicycles for friends and
anyone else who wanted to pay for them, he formed a bicycle company
originally called Mountain Bikes. While Fisher doesn't take credit
for originating off-road riding, he says he originated the phrase
``mountain bike'' and tried unsuccessfully to have it trademarked.
</P>
<P>
   By Fisher's second year in business, he and his business
partner, Charlie Kelly, were selling more bicycles over $1,000 than
anyone else in the country. But one of his goals was to make the
bikes more accessible to people, so he kept pushing down the price,
a process that accelerated in 1984 when he started manufacturing in
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   John Thompson, an associate editor at Mountain Bike magazine,
said Fisher was able to break away from the pack of smaller bike
manufacturers by producing quality bikes at reasonable prices and
marketing them. He said Fisher bikes appeal to a wide range of
riders because he makes them for professional riders as well as
relatively inexperienced weekend riders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mountain bikes can sell for as much as $6,000, but Fisher
makes very high quality bikes for a reasonable $1,500,'' Thompson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher is credited with producing the first mountain bike to
have shock absorbers on the front fork, called a shock fork;
helping to design the unicrown fork, which has fork blades welded
to steering tube; and for developing something he calls ``genesis
geometry,'' which repositions the rider on the bike through shorter
stem and chainstays, the pieces that connect the bottom bracket to
the back wheel holder.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Fisher's company started to hit some snags in the
late 1980s. He wouldn't discuss the privately held company's sales
figures, but said the capital-intensive nature of the business
contributed to its problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were growing like crazy, but we became a little too
leveraged out and we couldn't keep going,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher sold the company in 1991 for an undisclosed sum to a
Taiwanese company called Anlen. Anlen sold Fisher two years later
to Trek Bicycle Corp., a well-known bicycle manufacturer based in
Waterloo, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher is president of the Trek division, Gary Fisher Bicycles,
and is actively involved in developing and producing the models
that bear his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the roots of just riding the bike. I can arguably say
that I do more of that than anyone else (in the company),'' he
said, adding that he logs about 10,000 miles per year on his bike,
compared to about 4,000 on his car.
</P>
<P>
   But the industry is at a crossroads. Bicycle sales began to
stall in the early 1990s. According to the National Sporting Goods
Association, U.S. mountain bike sales have fallen since 1993, when
sales hit $1.17 billion. In 1995, sales were $889 million, and in
1997, the most recent year available, sales were $745 million.

JACK-O'-LANTERNS HAVE THEIR ROOTS IN IRELAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Pumpkins are as American as apple pie, but jack-o'-lanterns
migrated here from Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The name stems from an Irish legend about a stingy man named
Jack, who was too mean to get to heaven and who played tricks on
the devil. In death, Jack's penance was to walk Earth carrying a
lantern carved from a turnip and illuminated by a burning piece of
coal.
</P>
<P>
   He became known as ``Jack of the Lantern,'' or
``Jack-o'-lantern.''
</P>
<P>
   The Irish tradition was to place jack-o'-lanterns carved from
root vegetables in windows and by doors to scare away Stingy Jack
and other spirits on Halloween, or All Hallows' Eve, the day before
All Saints' Day, when churches honored the saints.
</P>
<P>
   In Medieval times children went door-to-door, singing and
begging for soul cakes for the wandering spirits. If no cakes were
offered, beggars or souls played pranks. Irish immigrants
introduced secular Halloween customs to the United States in the
late 19th century. Pumpkins replaced root vegetables and
``souling'' evolved into trick-or-treating. Today, many pumpkins
feature decorative carvings and portraiture.
</P>
<P>
   To aid in the carving, the kitchen knife has been replaced by
pumpkin carving kits costing up to $6, which also include a series
of templates for art-challenged carvers.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Guinness Book of World Records, the world's
largest carved jack-o'-lantern came from an 827-pound pumpkin grown
in 1992 in Nut Tree, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   If you are not good at carving, or don't like the mess of
scooping out the pulp and seeds, try painting a face on your
pumpkin.
</P>
<P>
   Pumpkins also make great decorative accessories, either as a
grouping on a table or for holding hot or chilled soups, dips,
candy (use a plastic liner) or votive candles.

MEXICO'S PRESIDENTIAL FRONT-RUNNER FINDS HE MUST WORK FOR VOTES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 San Antonio Express News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The man who could be the next president of Mexico
could not get away from the well-wishers. They hugged him, gave him
advice and offered food.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Labastida, the leading candidate to win the nomination
of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, had to gulp down
a dripping taco before he was able to drive off in a waiting black
Chevrolet Suburban.
</P>
<P>
   On a hazy Saturday, in the relaxed mood that only a weekend can
bring out in this jammed capital, Labastida had just finished
talking to a supportive, albeit somewhat discontent, crowd of about
3,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   In polite but firm voices, the likely Labastida supporters from
four rural electoral districts talked about their hopes for the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   They want more jobs, better salaries, less corruption; they
demanded rights for women and teachers; they complained about the
environment and their small plots of land, where it is becoming
harder to survive growing corn and beans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no equality in this country!'' one woman shouted when
it was her turn at the microphone. ``We are just as intelligent as
men, and we want a place in this world. Don't be fooled by
promises! Make the candidates prove it with their actions!''
</P>
<P>
   Labastida, crisp in a blue shirt and brown khakis, listened and
jotted notes. He would have an answer for the angry young woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want very much to be candidate of women,'' he told the crowd
gathered at the sports complex. ``I understand that the conditions
for equality have not been fully realized.''
</P>
<P>
   He then promised to create a national institute for women, to
promote social justice, increase wages and fight corruption and
crime.
</P>
<P>
   In previous election years, Labastida would have been all but
certain to become the president of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   But now he is fighting for it. He is in the unprecedented
position of having to campaign to become the presidential nominee
of the PRI, which has dominated Mexican politics for 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 7, Mexican voters go to the polls in the PRI's
first-ever primary race, and there are three other candidates
competing against Labastida to decide the party nominee in the 2000
election.
</P>
<P>
   The primary race is heating up, with the candidates stumping for
votes and bombarding the airwaves with American-style television
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   In these ads, Labastida is the candidate with ``clean hands,''
the one not soiled by shady dealings, and the cameras zoom him on
his entwined arms.
</P>
<P>
   It alludes to the non-clean hands of Roberto Madrazo,
Labastida's closest rival in the PRI contest, whom critics allege
took corrupt money to finance his campaign for governor of Tabasco
state.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo accuses Labastida of being the ``official candidate,''
the chosen heir in a failed political system.
</P>
<P>
   The other men vying for the PRI nomination are Manuel Bartlett,
the former governor of Puebla state, and former PRI leader Humberto
Roque Villanueva.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida, 57, who has been Mexico's secretary of the interior
and of agriculture, has had to fight this image of the chosen one _
not a good option in a country growing weary of the system.
</P>
<P>
   But his effort proved counter-productive. So he turned it to his
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make power work for you,'' say his political ads, admitting,
in a way, the force behind him.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, voters saw him as the favorite successor to
President Ernesto Zedillo, whose 6-year term expires next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it has helped with voters to know he is the official
candidate,'' said 21-year-old law student Luz Maria Gutierrez. ``Of
all the four candidates, he is more honest and sincere. But in
Mexico, it helps when you know the candidate is the president's
choice. It's the way people think.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the PRI's history, that is the way it's been done in
Mexico _ the president selected his successor, and this man always
won.
</P>
<P>
   But now there is a nascent democracy. While welcomed by most, it
also perplexes many longtime PRI members, men like Jesus Molotla
Mundo, 66, a crusty farmer wearing a straw hat as he waits on a
bench with three friends to hear Labastida speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand why there are four candidates. Do you know
why? This has never happened before. It is strange,'' Molotla said.
``But you know, they all make promises, and as soon as they become
president they forget about their promises. Maybe this one will be
different.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The son of a doctor, Labastida grew up with three brothers and
two sisters in the small town of Los Mochis in western Sinaloa
state, where he was governor from 1987 until 1992. He has said he
learned firsthand about the suffering and needs of the poor while
going on rounds to the countryside with his father.
</P>
<P>
   While a student of economics at the National Autonomous
University in Mexico City, Labastida married when he was 20. He has
five grown children, and today he is married to Maria Teresa
Uriarte, a doctorate in history who heads a research institute at
the Autonomous University, where Labastida also was a professor of
international economics.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being the apparent front-runner, Labastida has stiff
competition in 48-year-old Madrazo, whose renegade campaign could
also end up dividing the PRI when the primary race is over.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett and Roque have made the same promises of Labastida and
Madrazo, but they don't get personal. They don't mention anything
about official candidates, they don't call each other ``liar'' or
``failure,'' as Madrazo and Labastida have been known to do.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a Labastida presidency, Bartlett and Roque could end
up working in the Cabinet. Maybe even Madrazo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to see how we can incorporate them,'' admitted
Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   He talks like a winner. He sees the possibility of losing, but
doesn't think it likely.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thinks the PRI or his candidacy has been hurt by the
``official'' candidate label, Labastida is quick with a
mathematical answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't we see this in terms of numbers, because arithmetic
is the most precise language. Verbal language is filled with
emotion and adjectives, but numerical language expresses what is
occurring,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The preference for the party at this time last year was at
over 37 (percentage) points,'' he added. ``Now it is over 47
points, 10 points over. So this has not hurt.''

STUDENT GROUP SPURRED ENVIRONMENTAL AWAKENING IN '70S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DINA CAPPIELLO  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ They met late into the night in a darkened room
deep inside the art department on campus. Students and professors
crawled through open windows to grab a seat. With shades drawn,
they made plans to heal the planet.
</P>
<P>
   With smoke spewing from factories and waterways bubbling with
chemicals, the 1970s were a decade of awakening, when citizens
stepped outside and saw ecological destruction from their
doorsteps.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere was that awareness greater than on college campuses,
where the first Earth Day, a nationwide teach-in, took place on
April 22, 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pollution was everywhere. Certain parts of the river you could
throw a match on and they'd burn. Developers were trying to rape
the land that wasn't developed,'' said Don Rittner, a 1973 graduate
of the environmental studies program at the State University of New
York at Albany. ``You had a generation that looked around and said,
`What are we doing to our planet?' and decided to do something
about it. That was the birth of the environmental movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before New York state had an Environmental Conservation
Department, SUNY-Albany had a Protect Your Environment club. The
group formed during a time of protest, borrowing energy from the
anti-Vietnam War movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1969 we basically shut down the university,'' said George
Keleshian, the president of what came to be called PYE. ``There was
a lot of questioning at the time by students about the impact of
the corporate structure on the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   PYE's office was open 24 hours a day, and people called daily
asking for help with environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even local religious leaders asked me to explain what was
going on,'' recalled Louis Ismay, a professor in SUNY-Albany's
short-lived environmental studies program.
</P>
<P>
   The program, called the Environmental Forum, became a weekly
stage for the major environmental issues of the day. Toilet paper
floated down the Hudson River, and in a section known as the Albany
Pool, massive fish kills occurred every summer.
</P>
<P>
   Ismay's nine-credit course had two major requirements. The first
was to have a broad understanding of the issues. The second was to
choose one and take a leadership role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to tell them that you could catch more flies with honey
than vinegar. Environmentalism shouldn't have to be
confrontational,'' he said. ``It's righteous indignation. You have
a right to be indignant about destruction of the planet.''
</P>
<P>
   The fury fostered on campus spread to outlying communities,
seeping into the public's consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grass-roots impact on environmental issues was embraced in
the oft-quoted bumper sticker `Act Locally, Think Globally,''' said
John Mylod, director of Hudson River sloop Clearwater from 1976 to
1994. ``More people became aware of the impacts pollution carries
and the restrictions on natural resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Nader was the featured speaker for Earth Day on April 22,
1970. He declared PYE the most active group in the nation and in
his next breath announced the formation of the New York Public
Interest Research Group, an advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody who was anybody in the environment was involved. We
were tackling issues that were national and international from this
area,'' Keleshian said.
</P>
<P>
   Political science professor Robert Reinow wrote a book titled
``Moment in the Sun,'' which predicted a glut of people inhabiting
an exhausted Earth, and taught a class, ``Man Against the
Environment.'' Said Ismay: ``Every country in the world was
distributing buttons that said, `Nuclear Power, No Thanks.'''
</P>
<P>
   The fervor at SUNY-Albany wouldn't last long. PYE dissolved,
along with the Environmental Studies Program, when its funding was
cut in the late 1970s. Some blame it on a backlash.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of resentment for the Environmental Studies
Program,'' said Jon Thoreau Scott, its acting director for three
years. ``The faculty was not inclined to have a program they
thought was wishy-washy and in which the students were
rabble-rousers.''
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Stewart, director of the university's present-day
Biodiversity, Conservation and Policy master's program, was one of
those concerned about the activity fueled by the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The involvement of the students scared the administration to
death,'' she said. ``The war movement was all tied up with the
environmental revolution. It didn't last.''
</P>
<P>
   Or did it? Without doubt, the battleground has changed. In the
'70s, ``You could take cardboard and picket a plant and force
change,'' Mylod said. ``This has become much more difficult in the
last 20 to 30 years. Now you need legislation.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The United States bestrides the globe like a colossus. It
dominates business, commerce and communications; its economy is the
world's most successful, its military might second to none.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for all that, the colossus is uncertain. Having so much
power, it does not know how to behave. Should it act alone and
unhindered on the world stage, since it can? Or should it willingly
dilute its power in cooperation with others?
</P>
<P>
   Last week's vote against ratifying the Comprehensive Test-Ban
Treaty showed the dilemma at its height.
</P>
<P>
   Leave aside for the moment _ though it is hard _ the crass
partisanship of the Republican leaders in the Senate, who allowed
merely one day's debate on the issue before escorting it to the
scaffold.
</P>
<P>
   The more reasonable divide over the treaty was whether America
should act like a sovereign state, rejecting an agreement that was
not watertight as far as its own security was concerned, or whether
it should, despite that, satisfy its allies by ratifying it.
</P>
<P>
   Those senators who voted against have been condemned, not least
by President Bill Clinton, as isolationists. It is an epithet that
flies around freely these days. But true isolationism no longer
exists in the wired and globalized world of the end of the 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those who voted no were Gingrichian minimalists:
believers in the least possible state intervention either at home
or abroad. But most are better described as unilateralists: people
who believe that one of the perquisites of power is untrammelled
freedom of action on the world scene. And their influence is
growing.
</P>
<P>
   The case for turning towards the world, rather than away from
it, is generally accepted in America. By contrast, the case for
multilateralism is often far from self-evident.
</P>
<P>
   Multilateral institutions are often bureaucratic, ponderous and
inefficient. So America from time to time bullies them, ignores
them, refuses to pay its dues.
</P>
<P>
   Multilateral treaties, such as most of those covering arms
control, have the effect of tying down the signatories while rogue
states roam free. So America balks. Smaller countries may
appreciate the protection offered by multilateral instruments; for
a superpower, they are drags on its independence.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's interventions in Kosovo and East
Timor are increasingly condemned by many politicians, especially
Republican ones, as multilateralism gone mad, a promiscuous
spending of American energy on tiny and distant causes. And in
recent days, Congress has made savage cuts even in America's
contribution to peacekeeping by others.
</P>
<P>
   America's allies sometimes imagine that America's superpower
status has transformed it, or ought to have transformed it, into
some giant disinterested force for peace and good. But America is a
nation like any other; its own interests almost always come first.
</P>
<P>
   The world may be shocked to witness American invasions of
Grenada or Panama, but this is the United States acting _ with or
without anybody's permission _ to police its own hemisphere. And
since it faces no direct threat from any particular enemy, the
greater threat may often seem to be the multilateral strings that
tie this Gulliver down.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, since the collapse of the Soviet enemy _ for years, the
all-absorbing national priority _ nobody has spelled out what
America's interests are.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, in confusion on this as on every other aspect of
foreign policy, does not know. President Clinton, undisciplined and
ever concerned with the here and now, cannot articulate them.
</P>
<P>
   From the way the unilateralists talk, freedom of action would
seem to be America's first priority. In fact, America's first
interest is that the world should be stable, increasingly
democratic, and at peace.
</P>
<P>
   So how is peace best achieved? Some, George W. Bush among them,
argue that the best strategy is sheer military preeminence. No
nation would be fool enough to compete with the United States in a
new arms race.
</P>
<P>
   By thus presiding mightily over the world _ rather than getting
bogged down in the ``social work'' of open-ended deployments or
permanent peacekeeping _ America can ensure everybody's
tranquility.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a chimera. A passive America, even massively
armor-plated, is not much use either to others, or to itself. In
order to impose stability on a chaotic, constantly surprising
world, America needs to work with allies.
</P>
<P>
   When Saddam Hussein threatened America's oil supplies, the
biggest alliance ever seen was put together at America's behest.
</P>
<P>
   When outlaw states such as North Korea or Iraq threaten the
peace with nuclear or biological weapons, international cooperation
is needed to try to contain them.
</P>
<P>
   Such cooperation is not created out of thin air. It needs a
constant process of negotiation, communication and mutual help:
help that may involve (as Clinton, for all his faults, has
understood) the putting of money and manpower into places where, on
the face of it, America has no interest.
</P>
<P>
   To insist on going it alone is not only unhelpful. It is
self-defeating, since a country without allies forfeits influence
the more it stands alone.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it creates a dangerous precedent. America's
freelancing is accepted by its friends _ to the extent it is _
because the United States shares their democratic values. But
unilateralism from any quarter may be both worrying and
destabilizing.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, if America thinks it can behave without constraints in
the world, how is it to persuade other states that they should
accept constraints themselves?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had hoped to persuade India and Pakistan, two
antagonistic nuclear neighbors, to sign the test-ban treaty. Since
America itself has rejected it, his efforts seem likely to be in
vain. The preservation of sovereignty is not worth this loss of
leverage.
</P>
<P>
   In a few weeks, too, the WTO meeting opens in Seattle: a grand
exercise in multilateralism for the best of purposes, the
liberalization of world trade.
</P>
<P>
   The host country is approaching it sulkily, with its credibility
as a treaty-maker damaged and in a spirit of defiance that will
hardly encourage others to lower their barriers to commerce.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of posturing is much less effective than cooperation
might prove to be. Next year is unlikely to see much improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has definitively decided that partisanship no longer
stops ``at the water's edge''; foreign policy will be kicked back
and forth as savagely as the budget, if not always for bad reasons.
Clinton himself is weakened even more than would be normal at the
end of a second term.
</P>
<P>
   The American public, eyes fixed on the elections, will not
greatly care what happens beyond the seas. But they might consider
one thing. If America refuses multilateral entanglements, it may be
blissfully free; but it will also be alone.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a leader with no one to lead, in a world made
unstable by its very isolation. This is sovereignty, all right. But
a superpower should be bigger, and wiser, than that. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The United States bestrides the globe like a colossus. It
dominates business, commerce and communications; its economy is the
world's most successful, its military might second to none.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for all that, the colossus is uncertain. Having so much
power, it does not know how to behave. Should it act alone and
unhindered on the world stage, since it can? Or should it willingly
dilute its power in cooperation with others?
</P>
<P>
   Last week's vote against ratifying the Comprehensive Test-Ban
Treaty showed the dilemma at its height.
</P>
<P>
   Leave aside for the moment _ though it is hard _ the crass
partisanship of the Republican leaders in the Senate, who allowed
merely one day's debate on the issue before escorting it to the
scaffold.
</P>
<P>
   The more reasonable divide over the treaty was whether America
should act like a sovereign state, rejecting an agreement that was
not watertight as far as its own security was concerned, or whether
it should, despite that, satisfy its allies by ratifying it.
</P>
<P>
   Those senators who voted against have been condemned, not least
by President Bill Clinton, as isolationists. It is an epithet that
flies around freely these days. But true isolationism no longer
exists in the wired and globalized world of the end of the 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those who voted no were Gingrichian minimalists:
believers in the least possible state intervention either at home
or abroad. But most are better described as unilateralists: people
who believe that one of the perquisites of power is untrammelled
freedom of action on the world scene. And their influence is
growing.
</P>
<P>
   The case for turning towards the world, rather than away from
it, is generally accepted in America. By contrast, the case for
multilateralism is often far from self-evident.
</P>
<P>
   Multilateral institutions are often bureaucratic, ponderous and
inefficient. So America from time to time bullies them, ignores
them, refuses to pay its dues.
</P>
<P>
   Multilateral treaties, such as most of those covering arms
control, have the effect of tying down the signatories while rogue
states roam free. So America balks. Smaller countries may
appreciate the protection offered by multilateral instruments; for
a superpower, they are drags on its independence.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's interventions in Kosovo and East
Timor are increasingly condemned by many politicians, especially
Republican ones, as multilateralism gone mad, a promiscuous
spending of American energy on tiny and distant causes. And in
recent days, Congress has made savage cuts even in America's
contribution to peacekeeping by others.
</P>
<P>
   America's allies sometimes imagine that America's superpower
status has transformed it, or ought to have transformed it, into
some giant disinterested force for peace and good. But America is a
nation like any other; its own interests almost always come first.
</P>
<P>
   The world may be shocked to witness American invasions of
Grenada or Panama, but this is the United States acting _ with or
without anybody's permission _ to police its own hemisphere. And
since it faces no direct threat from any particular enemy, the
greater threat may often seem to be the multilateral strings that
tie this Gulliver down.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, since the collapse of the Soviet enemy _ for years, the
all-absorbing national priority _ nobody has spelled out what
America's interests are.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, in confusion on this as on every other aspect of
foreign policy, does not know. President Clinton, undisciplined and
ever concerned with the here and now, cannot articulate them.
</P>
<P>
   From the way the unilateralists talk, freedom of action would
seem to be America's first priority. In fact, America's first
interest is that the world should be stable, increasingly
democratic, and at peace.
</P>
<P>
   So how is peace best achieved? Some, George W. Bush among them,
argue that the best strategy is sheer military preeminence. No
nation would be fool enough to compete with the United States in a
new arms race.
</P>
<P>
   By thus presiding mightily over the world _ rather than getting
bogged down in the ``social work'' of open-ended deployments or
permanent peacekeeping _ America can ensure everybody's
tranquility.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a chimera. A passive America, even massively
armor-plated, is not much use either to others, or to itself. In
order to impose stability on a chaotic, constantly surprising
world, America needs to work with allies.
</P>
<P>
   When Saddam Hussein threatened America's oil supplies, the
biggest alliance ever seen was put together at America's behest.
</P>
<P>
   When outlaw states such as North Korea or Iraq threaten the
peace with nuclear or biological weapons, international cooperation
is needed to try to contain them.
</P>
<P>
   Such cooperation is not created out of thin air. It needs a
constant process of negotiation, communication and mutual help:
help that may involve (as Clinton, for all his faults, has
understood) the putting of money and manpower into places where, on
the face of it, America has no interest.
</P>
<P>
   To insist on going it alone is not only unhelpful. It is
self-defeating, since a country without allies forfeits influence
the more it stands alone.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it creates a dangerous precedent. America's
freelancing is accepted by its friends _ to the extent it is _
because the United States shares their democratic values. But
unilateralism from any quarter may be both worrying and
destabilizing.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, if America thinks it can behave without constraints in
the world, how is it to persuade other states that they should
accept constraints themselves?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had hoped to persuade India and Pakistan, two
antagonistic nuclear neighbors, to sign the test-ban treaty. Since
America itself has rejected it, his efforts seem likely to be in
vain. The preservation of sovereignty is not worth this loss of
leverage.
</P>
<P>
   In a few weeks, too, the WTO meeting opens in Seattle: a grand
exercise in multilateralism for the best of purposes, the
liberalization of world trade.
</P>
<P>
   The host country is approaching it sulkily, with its credibility
as a treaty-maker damaged and in a spirit of defiance that will
hardly encourage others to lower their barriers to commerce.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of posturing is much less effective than cooperation
might prove to be. Next year is unlikely to see much improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has definitively decided that partisanship no longer
stops ``at the water's edge''; foreign policy will be kicked back
and forth as savagely as the budget, if not always for bad reasons.
Clinton himself is weakened even more than would be normal at the
end of a second term.
</P>
<P>
   The American public, eyes fixed on the elections, will not
greatly care what happens beyond the seas. But they might consider
one thing. If America refuses multilateral entanglements, it may be
blissfully free; but it will also be alone.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a leader with no one to lead, in a world made
unstable by its very isolation. This is sovereignty, all right. But
a superpower should be bigger, and wiser, than that. &QL;

<P>
   It is not immediately obvious that the best person to lead a
country emerging from 32 years of autocracy and a further 17 months
of turbulent change should be an infirm Muslim scholar who has
suffered two strokes and can claim no direct mandate from the
voters.
</P>
<P>
   To complicate matters, it should be said that the country is
Indonesia, whose 200 million people make it the
fourth-most-populous in the world; that it is still trying to
rebuild its economy after a devastating financial whirlwind; that
its 7,000 inhabited islands and 300 languages and dialects mean it
is, at the best of times, a difficult place to run.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes, and now, as it happens, it is convulsed by the
secession of a distant ``province,'' East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Still, cheer up: Abdurrahman Wahid was by no means the worst of
the possibilities. He may even turn out to be an excellent
president.
</P>
<P>
   The first task for Wahid, better known as Gus Dur, is to
establish his democratic credentials. Indonesia has had only one
democratic general election in recent years, and that was in June,
when the voters went to the polls to choose a legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The winning party was that of Megawati Sukarnoputri, daughter of
Indonesia's first president, Sukarno, and staunch critic of the
regime that succeeded him, which was led first by President Suharto
and then by his chosen successor, President B.J. Habibie.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Megawati's party, however, failed to win enough votes to
give it a majority in the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR),
which is the body that chooses the president. And after Habibie
withdrew his candidacy this week, a majority of the MPR's members,
some of whom are appointed, not elected, opted for Wahid.
</P>
<P>
   This has disappointed many of the protesters who helped to drive
Suharto from the presidency last year and who saw Miss Megawati as
the preeminent people's choice.
</P>
<P>
   Their sense of having been cheated may perhaps be muted by the
selection of Miss Megawati as Wahid's vice-president. Yet it would
be quite wrong to see Wahid either as a supporter of the old regime
or as an enemy of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative he certainly is, but his opposition to Suharto is
long-standing. And, though he owes his public position to his
leadership of a large Muslim organization _ the world's largest _
he is a firm believer in secularism.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, this makes it odd that he, as a Muslim leader,
should now become head of government, especially as only 30 percent
or so of Indonesians are in fact practicing Muslims, though
official statistics put the figure at 87 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet no one is more conscious of this than Wahid himself, who
acknowledges that the great majority of even nominal Muslims are
uninterested in a Muslim agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, other Muslim leaders lament their compatriots' lack
of zeal and would like to see the country become more Islamized.
Moreover, Wahid owes his victory this week to the votes of some of
these people. He must now resist them if they demand any erosion of
the separation of mosque and state.
</P>
<P>
   A more immediate preoccupation may be the economy, which is less
parlous than it was but still requires careful nursing.
</P>
<P>
   The banking system is in urgent need of reform and, more
generally, the country is imbued with a culture of corruption,
which has spread from the top down.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid's honesty is not in doubt. Aided by a court ruling this
week that allows parliament to see, and therefore publish, a report
into a recent banking scandal, he can now set about cutting out the
rot that did so much to bring about the collapse of the economy two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That may be painful for some: it will involve bringing to book
some prominent public figures. But it is necessary if Indonesians
are to feel they now enjoy the rule of law. And it will,
incidentally, also restore the lending at present suspended by the
IMF and other foreign creditors.
</P>
<P>
   If the country's moral integrity will be one of Wahid's
concerns, its physical integrity will be another.
</P>
<P>
   The departure of the annexed territory of East Timor, sanctioned
by the MPR this week, is to be welcomed; it lifts an incubus from
Indonesia which has prevented it from carrying the weight it
deserves in world councils. But it does not mean that other
restless corners of the archipelago, such as Aceh and Irian Jaya,
must also depart.
</P>
<P>
   If Wahid can persuade the dissidents in these far-off places
that rule from Jakarta is benign, not autocratic, Indonesia can
hold together. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (75-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 775) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That, however, will involve bringing the army firmly under
civilian control _ no easy task in a country that has given the
armed forces a constitutional role in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Although considered a candidate, General Wiranto, the armed
forces' commander, has won neither the presidency nor the
vice-presidency. That is welcome.
</P>
<P>
   He should now accept an end to the armed forces' entitlement to
make appointments to the MPR, and to their more general activities
in what should, in a democracy, be civilian affairs. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 950) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Can Wahid do all this?
</P>
<P>
   Frail, almost blind, with no experience of government, he will
find it hard. But he is intelligent, charming and witty; he has led
an organization with 30 million-35 million followers; and he has
shown an ability to practice the arts of politics _ sometimes
dallying with Miss Megawati, whose disdain for deal-making was her
undoing this week, sometimes with others.
</P>
<P>
   Honest, respected, widely known in Indonesia, he is above all a
clear break with the past. He deserves his country's, and his
country's friends', support. &QL;

<P>
   DENVER _ As the latest set of dismal test scores was announced
in Colorado _ 41 percent of 11-year-olds failing to meet state
standards in reading, and 69 percent failing to meet them in
writing _ Bill Maloney, the state's education commissioner, had
sobering words: ``If we do not put our house in order, rougher
hands will do it for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Those rougher hands are the reformers who would like to
introduce vouchers and public-school choice.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another experiment going on in the state capital,
Denver, which might improve the public-school system from within _
and keep more radical alternatives at bay, for a while at least.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Denver became the first city in America to bring in
a plan linking teachers' salaries directly to their pupils'
performance. (Tony Blair's government wants to introduce such a
scheme in Britain's schools).
</P>
<P>
   The Denver scheme, approved by the local teachers' union, will
be tested in a handful of schools for two years. Its success, if it
does succeed, could pave the way for other troubled urban school
districts which are trying to break the relentless pattern of
pupils who fail to progress.
</P>
<P>
   Various merit-pay programs have been tested around the country.
Most of them were unsuccessful because they relied on subjective
evaluations of the teachers by school principals.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Denver scheme, teachers will be judged by the
performance of their pupils in both standardized exams and tests
made up by teachers, as well as by their general progress.
</P>
<P>
   Since the plan had to win the approval of the Denver teachers'
union, it is decidedly timid at present. Those volunteering to take
part receive a pay raise simply for doing so, and they will not be
penalized if pupils show no improvement at the end of two years.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, officials in Denver are adamant that, if this
pilot project works, the city will completely overhaul the pay
scheme of its teachers in favor of one based almost entirely on how
their pupils fare.
</P>
<P>
   Will the unions let the city get away with that? Pay based on
seniority _ years served, nothing more _ is something they consider
sacred.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, teachers' unions have always defeated challenges to
traditional ways of paying teachers. Yet the movement all over
America towards paying by merit may gain momentum for one good
reason: the unions' leaders realize they have no choice.
</P>
<P>
   With more states and cities experimenting with radical school
reform, especially voucher schemes, the unions are finding it
politic to accept the smaller fiddles. That is why the head of the
National Education Association, America's largest teachers' union,
pays lip-service to the Denver experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Some teachers are also prepared to compromise because they now
genuinely understand that accountability is something that has to
be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Making teachers' pay dependent on student achievement, advocates
argue, at last gives teachers not only a financial stake in the
future of their pupils but also a greater sense of responsibility
for the tax dollars going into the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   As with any system of competition, it rewards the best teachers,
and punishes the incompetent. And none too soon, most American
parents would say.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, much of the debate about merit pay involves the
question of how pupil achievement ought to be measured. Is it fair,
for example, to demand the same of poor pupils and rich ones?
</P>
<P>
   Many teachers are also concerned that pay-for-performance
schemes will increase reliance on statewide standardized tests,
which are already used to decide everything from whether pupils go
up to the next class at the end of the year to the amount of money
given to each school district.
</P>
<P>
   Some politicians now advocate testing as the only objective way
to measure academic performance.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, the governor of Texas, said in a recent speech
that ``without testing, reform is a journey without a compass.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet many teachers do not share Bush's views on navigation, and
believe it is unfair to use standardized tests to compare suburban
districts with inner-city schools. They are wary of staking their
own livelihood on such tests, and will no doubt fight for other
assessment methods in merit-pay schemes around the country.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a smallish fight, however. The bigger battle, about
reining in the power of the public-school bureaucracy, is already
being won by those rough hands of reform.

<P>
   NAZARETH _ The millennium celebrations seemed to offer a golden
opportunity for Nazareth, Jesus's hometown and Israel's largest
Arab city. But the city still does not have a functioning council,
let alone the hotels or roads to cope with the millions of tourists
expected to arrive next year.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it is in the throes of a row between the Communist (and
Christian) mayor, Ramez Jeraisi, and his Islamist opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We blew it,'' admits Lutfy Mashour, editor of a local paper.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute started in 1997 when Israel's tourist ministry gave
the council money to build a plaza on a small plot of land below
Nazareth's Basilica of the Annunciation, where, according to
tradition, the angel Gabriel appeared before Mary.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamists said the land belonged to al-Waqf (a Muslim
religious endowment) and pitched a tent-cum-mosque on the site in
protest.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, having gained a one-seat majority on the council,
they made the building of a mosque a condition for working with the
mayor. Jeraisi insisted that this was for the government, not the
council, to decide.
</P>
<P>
   Until this year, most viewed the squabble as a political
football in the wider contest between Israel's declining Communist
party (historically the main political tribune for Israel's 1
million or so Arab citizens) and the rising Islamist movement.
</P>
<P>
   Things got nastier when the Israeli referees started to play for
both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Netanyahu, who was then prime minister, hinted to the
Islamist leaders that a mosque could be built in exchange for a
call to their followers to abstain in the coming vote for prime
minister (Israeli Arabs supported Ehud Barak, not Netanyahu).
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Israel's then-foreign minister, Ariel Sharon,
reportedly told the Vatican (which owns the Basilica of the
Annunciation) that a mosque would not be built.
</P>
<P>
   This mix of outside intrigue and inside tension led, last
Easter, to open fights between Christians and Muslims, in which 40
people were injured. But both sides were still waiting for the
decision of a ministerial committee, set up by Netanyahu but now
under the chairmanship of Shlomo Ben-Ami, the new internal security
minister.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 7, Nazareth's District Court ruled that the land in
question did not belong to al-Waqf but to the state, and it was
therefore up to the government to decide its fate.
</P>
<P>
   Wary about Islamist reaction (a wariness strengthened by the
discovery that the people behind a botched bomb attack in Israel
last month were supporters of the Islamist movement in Galilee),
Ben-Ami sought a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The council should build the plaza, he announced on Oct. 13. But
700 square meters (840 square yards) should be set aside for a
mosque to be built towards the end of next year, on condition that
the protest tent was removed by Nov. 8.
</P>
<P>
   It was a Solomonic ruling that pleased nobody. The Latin
Patriarch in Jerusalem deplored the decision, saying that it might
jeopardize the Pope's planned visit next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamists said the tent would be removed over their dead
bodies, and muttered darkly about papal conspiracies stopping ``the
right of Muslims to build a mosque on Muslim land.''
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 16, Jeraisi was assaulted in the city for the second
time in four months.
</P>
<P>
   For the people of Nazareth (only 30 percent of whom are now
Christian), such incidents are a sad testimony to the fragmentation
of their city along religious lines.
</P>
<P>
   But some Israelis may not be too dismayed. Israeli governments
of whatever stripe have always preferred to treat their Arab
citizens less in terms of what they are _ a national minority of
Palestinian Arabs who stayed on their lands after the Jewish state
was established in 1948 _ than in terms of the religion they
espouse. &QL;

   NAZARETH _ The millennium celebrations seemed to offer a golden
opportunity for Nazareth, Jesus's hometown and Israel's largest
Arab city. But the city still does not have a functioning council,
let alone the hotels or roads to cope with the millions of tourists
expected to arrive next year.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it is in the throes of a row between the Communist (and
Christian) mayor, Ramez Jeraisi, and his Islamist opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We blew it,'' admits Lutfy Mashour, editor of a local paper.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute started in 1997 when Israel's tourist ministry gave
the council money to build a plaza on a small plot of land below
Nazareth's Basilica of the Annunciation, where, according to
tradition, the angel Gabriel appeared before Mary.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamists said the land belonged to al-Waqf (a Muslim
religious endowment) and pitched a tent-cum-mosque on the site in
protest.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, having gained a one-seat majority on the council,
they made the building of a mosque a condition for working with the
mayor. Jeraisi insisted that this was for the government, not the
council, to decide.
</P>
<P>
   Until this year, most viewed the squabble as a political
football in the wider contest between Israel's declining Communist
party (historically the main political tribune for Israel's 1
million or so Arab citizens) and the rising Islamist movement.
</P>
<P>
   Things got nastier when the Israeli referees started to play for
both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Netanyahu, who was then prime minister, hinted to the
Islamist leaders that a mosque could be built in exchange for a
call to their followers to abstain in the coming vote for prime
minister (Israeli Arabs supported Ehud Barak, not Netanyahu).
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Israel's then-foreign minister, Ariel Sharon,
reportedly told the Vatican (which owns the Basilica of the
Annunciation) that a mosque would not be built.
</P>
<P>
   This mix of outside intrigue and inside tension led, last
Easter, to open fights between Christians and Muslims, in which 40
people were injured. But both sides were still waiting for the
decision of a ministerial committee, set up by Netanyahu but now
under the chairmanship of Shlomo Ben-Ami, the new internal security
minister.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 7, Nazareth's District Court ruled that the land in
question did not belong to al-Waqf but to the state, and it was
therefore up to the government to decide its fate.
</P>
<P>
   Wary about Islamist reaction (a wariness strengthened by the
discovery that the people behind a botched bomb attack in Israel
last month were supporters of the Islamist movement in Galilee),
Ben-Ami sought a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The council should build the plaza, he announced on Oct. 13. But
700 square meters (840 square yards) should be set aside for a
mosque to be built towards the end of next year, on condition that
the protest tent was removed by Nov. 8.
</P>
<P>
   It was a Solomonic ruling that pleased nobody. The Latin
Patriarch in Jerusalem deplored the decision, saying that it might
jeopardize the Pope's planned visit next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamists said the tent would be removed over their dead
bodies, and muttered darkly about papal conspiracies stopping ``the
right of Muslims to build a mosque on Muslim land.''
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 16, Jeraisi was assaulted in the city for the second
time in four months.
</P>
<P>
   For the people of Nazareth (only 30 percent of whom are now
Christian), such incidents are a sad testimony to the fragmentation
of their city along religious lines.
</P>
<P>
   But some Israelis may not be too dismayed. Israeli governments
of whatever stripe have always preferred to treat their Arab
citizens less in terms of what they are _ a national minority of
Palestinian Arabs who stayed on their lands after the Jewish state
was established in 1948 _ than in terms of the religion they
espouse. &QL;

   JAKARTA _ He is frail, partially blind and sometimes says the
strangest things. But those are not the only reasons why
Abdurrahman Wahid, more popularly known in Indonesia as Gus Dur,
was considered such a long shot for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   He was also supposed to be the closest ally of Megawati
Sukarnoputri, the popular daughter of Indonesia's first president
and the front-running opposition candidate in the race.
</P>
<P>
   In June, after Indonesia's first free elections in four decades,
Megawati's party finished first, and Wahid's fourth. But in a
surprising vote in the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) on Oct.
20, Wahid beat the favorite by 373 votes to 313. Megawati's
supporters immediately rampaged on to the streets.
</P>
<P>
   B.J. Habibie, who had taken over when President Suharto was
forced from office in May 1998, had pulled out of the contest once
the MPR had in effect passed a vote of no confidence in his
leadership the day before. In a secret ballot, the MPR then went on
to elect Wahid as Indonesia's fourth president.
</P>
<P>
   He was backed by other Muslim parties and many supporters of the
former ruling party, Golkar, which decided not to field a candidate
to replace Habibie.
</P>
<P>
   Megawati's supporters were crushed, and staged violent protests
in cities around the country. Two bombs exploded in Jakarta,
killing two people.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market, which had shot up by 10 percent when Habibie
withdrew his candidacy, quickly shed its gains.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary Indonesians, still reeling from a series of tumultuous
events _ including this week the formal acceptance that East Timor
would be set free _ were left wondering what was going on in their
country.
</P>
<P>
   They will have to wait a little longer to find out. Indonesia's
transition towards democracy is not only momentous but also
experimental: much of it is being made up as the leading characters
stumble along.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid's National Awakening Party is small and inexperienced. The
direction of the new government will be revealed only gradually as
the new president reaches out to other parties in order to fill
important positions.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 21, the MPR comfortably elected Megawati as
vice-president, a crucial position in Indonesia given Wahid's poor
health.
</P>
<P>
   Two other candidates, General Wiranto, the chief of the armed
forces, and Akbar Tandjung, Golkar's chairman, dropped out of the
race leaving Hamzah Haz, the leader of another Muslim party, as her
sole challenger.
</P>
<P>
   Many Golkar party members gave their support to Megawati. Her
election as vice-president was widely seen as a way of keeping her
supporters in check, but what skills she will bring to the post
remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Wahid began doling out government jobs, his election
had stirred up two big fears.
</P>
<P>
   One was that the transition to democracy could be endangered.
After all, though Megawati's party had won the most votes in the
June election to Indonesia's lower house, she was then defeated in
the ballot for the presidency by the 700 members of the MPR, some
of whom are not elected.
</P>
<P>
   The second fear was the rise of Islamic power, long held in
check during Suharto's 32-year rule, in the world's biggest Muslim
country.
</P>
<P>
   Yet these worries have less to do with Wahid than with the
political jockeying that put him in office. As the former head of
Nahdlatul Ulama, a large grass-roots Muslim organization founded by
his grandfather, Wahid has long been one of Indonesia's most
respected and influential figures.
</P>
<P>
   During Suharto's rule he was one of the few people honest and
clever enough both to refuse the autocrat's enticements and to
dodge his blows.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is prone to conflicting statements, he has long
remained consistent on the role of Islam in politics: he does not
believe there should be one.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the parties that have swept him into power disagree, and
said so loudly during the general-election campaign and subsequent
political bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   Some Islamist parties have questioned whether Megawati, because
she is a woman, has any right to lead Indonesia. Although more than
80% of Indonesians are nominally Muslim, less than half are devout
and many see no reason to bring religion into government.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, resurgent Islamic parties could complicate efforts
to keep the country in one piece. With the granting of independence
to East Timor, even though its circumstances are different, there
are growing separatist demands from other provinces.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes these are mixed up with religious issues. In one
separatist province, Aceh, the right to apply Islamic law locally
is likely to be a demand in any autonomy proposals.
</P>
<P>
   To hold the country together, Wahid will have his work cut out
keeping Islamist supporters in check. But the respect he commands
among many Muslims, combined with his secular outlook, could make
him the ideal man for the job. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (STORY CAN HERE AT 800; UNCUT VERSION IS 1,125 WORDS) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He could also prove to be a more democratic choice than
Megawati. Although her party finished first in the June poll, it
was well short of a majority _ even among those who had voted
against Golkar.
</P>
<P>
   With 48 parties contesting the election, the opposition votes
were fragmented; so, arguably, Wahid will reflect many voters'
aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   Megawati, aloof and unwilling to get her hands dirty by
negotiating with other parties, showed huge political failings. She
alienated Wahid and Amien Rais, another reformist Muslim leader and
potential ally, who is now speaker of the MPR.
</P>
<P>
   Rais's role is another reason for optimism. Although he has been
less consistently secular than Wahid, he has been outspoken in
condemning the abuses of the Suharto era.
</P>
<P>
   If Indonesia is to forge a democratic system for itself, it must
rethink its constitution and create checks on executive power. Rais
seems well suited to the task.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid could prove to be a popular leader who does not exacerbate
any of the conflicts still raging in Indonesia. But the task before
him is huge.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from putting back together a wrecked economy, he also
needs to rein in the armed forces. This would mean bringing the
generals under civilian control and removing their political power,
exercised through their 38 parliamentary seats, among other ways.
</P>
<P>
   He must also root out corruption and create a more competent and
decentralized government. A huge scandal involving Bank Bali may be
the place to start; it swirls around people close to Habibie.
</P>
<P>
   A decision this week by the courts to release an audit of the
bank to parliament will allow aid to flow again from the IMF and
World Bank. It all seems an enormous task for a frail 59-year-old.
But Wahid's moral authority could be just what Indonesia now
needs. &QL;

leadership the day before. In a secret ballot, the MPR then went on
to elect Wahid as Indonesia's fourth president.
</P>
<P>
   He was backed by other Muslim parties and many supporters of the
former ruling party, Golkar, which decided not to field a candidate
to replace Habibie.
</P>
<P>
   Megawati's supporters were crushed, and staged violent protests
in cities around the country. Two bombs exploded in Jakarta,
killing two people.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market, which had shot up by 10 percent when Habibie
withdrew his candidacy, quickly shed its gains.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary Indonesians, still reeling from a series of tumultuous
events _ including this week the formal acceptance that East Timor
would be set free _ were left wondering what was going on in their
country.
</P>
<P>
   They will have to wait a little longer to find out. Indonesia's
transition towards democracy is not only momentous but also
experimental: much of it is being made up as the leading characters
stumble along.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid's National Awakening Party is small and inexperienced. The
direction of the new government will be revealed only gradually as
the new president reaches out to other parties in order to fill
important positions.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 21, the MPR comfortably elected Megawati as
vice-president, a crucial position in Indonesia given Wahid's poor
health.
</P>
<P>
   Two other candidates, General Wiranto, the chief of the armed
forces, and Akbar Tandjung, Golkar's chairman, dropped out of the
race leaving Hamzah Haz, the leader of another Muslim party, as her
sole challenger.
</P>
<P>
   Many Golkar party members gave their support to Megawati. Her
election as vice-president was widely seen as a way of keeping her
supporters in check, but what skills she will bring to the post
remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Wahid began doling out government jobs, his election
had stirred up two big fears.
</P>
<P>
   One was that the transition to democracy could be endangered.
After all, though Megawati's party had won the most votes in the
June election to Indonesia's lower house, she was then defeated in
the ballot for the presidency by the 700 members of the MPR, some
of whom are not elected.
</P>
<P>
   The second fear was the rise of Islamic power, long held in
check during Suharto's 32-year rule, in the world's biggest Muslim
country.
</P>
<P>
   Yet these worries have less to do with Wahid than with the
political jockeying that put him in office. As the former head of
Nahdlatul Ulama, a large grass-roots Muslim organization founded by
his grandfather, Wahid has long been one of Indonesia's most
respected and influential figures.
</P>
<P>
   During Suharto's rule he was one of the few people honest and
clever enough both to refuse the autocrat's enticements and to
dodge his blows.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is prone to conflicting statements, he has long
remained consistent on the role of Islam in politics: he does not
believe there should be one.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the parties that have swept him into power disagree, and
said so loudly during the general-election campaign and subsequent
political bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   Some Islamist parties have questioned whether Megawati, because
she is a woman, has any right to lead Indonesia. Although more than
80% of Indonesians are nominally Muslim, less than half are devout
and many see no reason to bring religion into government.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, resurgent Islamic parties could complicate efforts
to keep the country in one piece. With the granting of independence
to East Timor, even though its circumstances are different, there
are growing separatist demands from other provinces.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes these are mixed up with religious issues. In one
separatist province, Aceh, the right to apply Islamic law locally
is likely to be a demand in any autonomy proposals.
</P>
<P>
   To hold the country together, Wahid will have his work cut out
keeping Islamist supporters in check. But the respect he commands
among many Muslims, combined with his secular outlook, could make
him the ideal man for the job. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (STORY CAN HERE AT 800; UNCUT VERSION IS 1,125 WORDS) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He could also prove to be a more democratic choice than
Megawati. Although her party finished first in the June poll, it
was well short of a majority _ even among those who had voted
against Golkar.
</P>
<P>
   With 48 parties contesting the election, the opposition votes
were fragmented; so, arguably, Wahid will reflect many voters'
aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   Megawati, aloof and unwilling to get her hands dirty by
negotiating with other parties, showed huge political failings. She
alienated Wahid and Amien Rais, another reformist Muslim leader and
potential ally, who is now speaker of the MPR.
</P>
<P>
   Rais's role is another reason for optimism. Although he has been
less consistently secular than Wahid, he has been outspoken in
condemning the abuses of the Suharto era.
</P>
<P>
   If Indonesia is to forge a democratic system for itself, it must
rethink its constitution and create checks on executive power. Rais
seems well suited to the task.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid could prove to be a popular leader who does not exacerbate
any of the conflicts still raging in Indonesia. But the task before
him is huge.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from putting back together a wrecked economy, he also
needs to rein in the armed forces. This would mean bringing the
generals under civilian control and removing their political power,
exercised through their 38 parliamentary seats, among other ways.
</P>
<P>
   He must also root out corruption and create a more competent and
decentralized government. A huge scandal involving Bank Bali may be
the place to start; it swirls around people close to Habibie.
</P>
<P>
   A decision this week by the courts to release an audit of the
bank to parliament will allow aid to flow again from the IMF and
World Bank. It all seems an enormous task for a frail 59-year-old.
But Wahid's moral authority could be just what Indonesia now
needs. &QL;

   TOKYO _ The electric organ broke into ``The Girl from Ipanema''
just as Carlos Ghosn was due to walk on stage at the Tokyo Motor
Show on Oct. 20. It was just a tease: the music switched to the
usual raucous backing-track as the diminutive, Brazilian-born Ghosn
stepped up.
</P>
<P>
   In clear _ if scripted _ Japanese he pledged that the sick man
of the country's industry would become ``younger,'' more dynamic
and bolder.
</P>
<P>
   Two days earlier, speaking to journalists in English, he had
declared that 21,000 jobs must go by March 2002 if the firm is to
survive. No fewer than 16,400 of the cuts will fall in Japan; five
Japanese factories must close.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his speech, Ghosn broke into Japanese again.
``There is no alternative,'' he said. ``Failure is not an option.''
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn, who is credited with restoring Renault chiefly by
cost-cutting, arrived as chief operating officer of Japan's
second-biggest car maker after the French firm had bailed it out
last March, injecting Yen643 billion ($5.4 billion) for a
controlling 37 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   Like Jac Nasser, the Australian boss shaking up Ford, Ghosn is
of Lebanese origin _ indeed, they look like cousins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lebanese by descent, Brazilian by birth, a French citizen and
Japanese by adoption,'' is how Ghosn puts it.
</P>
<P>
   That is a good mix, for if Ghosn is to succeed, he needs to
combine Arab deal-making, Latin energy, Gallic strategy and an
Asian feeling for consensus.
</P>
<P>
   There is a long, if inglorious, tradition in Japan of
bureaucrats using gaiatsu (foreign pressure) to achieve otherwise
unpalatable reforms. As more Japanese companies find that they have
neither the corporate structure nor the stomach to cut waste, close
factories and sack workers, gaiatsu is moving into business.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan is not the only Japanese car maker to turn to foreigners.
General Motors has increased its stakes in Isuzu and Suzuki as the
core of its strategy to win 10 percent of the Asian car market.
Since Ford raised its stake in Mazda to one-third, it has run the
show.
</P>
<P>
   Now Fuji Heavy Industries, owner of Subaru, which is affiliated
with Nissan, has acknowledged that its offspring needs a foreign
ally _ possibly GM again.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as the firm that has most abjectly thrown its lot in with a
foreigner, Nissan is the one being most carefully watched.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn admits that it is easier for an outsider to make changes,
especially as he had nothing to do with previous attempts to mend
Nissan. Even so, powerful plant managers with seats on the board
have thwarted one ``revival'' after another.
</P>
<P>
   The firm has lost money for four of the past five years. This is
probably its last chance.
</P>
<P>
   The plan for Nissan's revival was greeted with gasps of horror
and disbelief. Yet Nissan's bosses, and the analysts who follow the
firm, have known for a year that something like it would come along
sooner or later.
</P>
<P>
   Like many firms that overinvested during the bubble, when
capital, in effect, cost almost nothing, Nissan has overcapacity of
30-40 percent. Like others, too, it has taken the easy path of
cutting working hours instead of closing plants and laying off
workers.
</P>
<P>
   You do not have to be a rocket scientist to realize that a car
maker able to make 2.4 million vehicles a year in Japan, but
producing fewer than 1.3 million, is running its plants at a
disastrously low level.
</P>
<P>
   To reach 75-80 percent utilization, at which point most car
firms break even, capacity needs to shrink by at least 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Under Ghosn's plan, Nissan's domestic capacity is to drop to a
more realistic 1.65 million units a year by 2002, maybe raising
utilization to 82 percent.
</P>
<P>
   First to go, by March 2001, will be the assembly plants at
Murayama near Tokyo, the Nissan Shatai factory in Kyoto and the
Aichi Kikai Minato plant in Nagoya. Next will be the Kurihama
engine plant in Kanagawa and the Kyushu engine shop in Fukuoka.
</P>
<P>
   By 2002 Ghosn wants Nissan to be turning out a variety of models
using only 15 different ``platforms'' (the costly floor structures
that determine many components) at only four plants. Today, the
firm uses no fewer than 24 platforms at seven different plants.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest savings will come when Renault and Nissan start
sharing platforms. The first to be used jointly will come in 2002
with the replacement of Nissan's Micra and Cube models, and
Renault's new Clio and Twingo models.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, Nissan and Renault then expect to churn out at
least 1 million units a year using one platform. By 2010, they aim
to concentrate their output on ten shared platforms. Yet even then,
Nissan would still be losing money on every car it built in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   With materials and components accounting for more than 60
percent of the cost of making a car, Nissan has to do something
about its fragmented suppliers. So Ghosn intends to cut Nissan's
supplier list from 1,145 firms to no more than 600 within three
years. Suppliers can then spread costs over larger volumes.
</P>
<P>
   By 2002 this is expected to yield a 20 percent saving on
procurement costs, worth $1.7 billion a year. Nissan wants a
further 20 percent reduction in costs by, among other things,
ending the sales incentives that it offers dealers to shift all the
surplus cars it makes.
</P>
<P>
   It will sever relations with a fifth of its domestic-sales
affiliates, shut 10 percent of its retail outlets in Japan,
streamline dealer networks in America and Europe, and give its
advertising to a single agency.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn also intends to sell anything within the group that is
unprofitable or peripheral to its business. Even the firm's highly
regarded aerospace division could be on the block.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the revival aims to trim Nissan's costs by Yen1
trillion and to produce a consolidated operating profit of 4.5
percent of sales by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Will it? &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (225-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 1,025) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A lot could still go wrong. Japanese interest rates cannot stay
low for ever, and with debt of Yen2.6 trillion (including Yen1.2
trillion in the firm's financing division) Nissan is horribly
exposed to any rise.
</P>
<P>
   The company will also be hurt more than most by any further
strengthening of the yen against the dollar. Each one-yen rise in
the rate knocks Yen7 billion off the firm's operating profits.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there any guarantee that Nissan will be able to raise
enough from asset sales to reduce its debts by the Yen700 billion
planned. And Nissan cannot hope to dispose of 16,400 Japanese
workers simply by natural wastage and a freeze on hiring.
</P>
<P>
   Trimming work forces costs around Yen24 million a job, five
times the rate in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians from districts affected by plant closures will
inevitably respond. With a general election next year, the
government is already muttering about stopping Nissan from sending
Japan's record unemployment any higher. Nobody should underestimate
the influence of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   And yet Ghosn has a few advantages. Everybody knows that Nissan,
like so many Japanese companies, needs radical treatment. And
Nissan has a corporate style _ bureaucratic, elitist and urbane _
that may be more like Renault's traditional culture than any other
car firm inside or outside Japan. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES AT 1,300 WORDS) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Against the odds, Ghosn turned Renault around. If anyone can do
the same for Nissan, it is him. The rest of corporate Japan will be
observing closely from the sidelines _ and may be preparing to
follow his lead. &QL;

   TOKYO _ The electric organ broke into ``The Girl from Ipanema''
just as Carlos Ghosn was due to walk on stage at the Tokyo Motor
Show on Oct. 20. It was just a tease: the music switched to the
usual raucous backing-track as the diminutive, Brazilian-born Ghosn
stepped up.
</P>
<P>
   In clear _ if scripted _ Japanese he pledged that the sick man
of the country's industry would become ``younger,'' more dynamic
and bolder.
</P>
<P>
   Two days earlier, speaking to journalists in English, he had
declared that 21,000 jobs must go by March 2002 if the firm is to
survive. No fewer than 16,400 of the cuts will fall in Japan; five
Japanese factories must close.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his speech, Ghosn broke into Japanese again.
``There is no alternative,'' he said. ``Failure is not an option.''
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn, who is credited with restoring Renault chiefly by
cost-cutting, arrived as chief operating officer of Japan's
second-biggest car maker after the French firm had bailed it out
last March, injecting Yen643 billion ($5.4 billion) for a
controlling 37 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   Like Jac Nasser, the Australian boss shaking up Ford, Ghosn is
of Lebanese origin _ indeed, they look like cousins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lebanese by descent, Brazilian by birth, a French citizen and
Japanese by adoption,'' is how Ghosn puts it.
</P>
<P>
   That is a good mix, for if Ghosn is to succeed, he needs to
combine Arab deal-making, Latin energy, Gallic strategy and an
Asian feeling for consensus.
</P>
<P>
   There is a long, if inglorious, tradition in Japan of
bureaucrats using gaiatsu (foreign pressure) to achieve otherwise
unpalatable reforms. As more Japanese companies find that they have
neither the corporate structure nor the stomach to cut waste, close
factories and sack workers, gaiatsu is moving into business.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan is not the only Japanese car maker to turn to foreigners.
General Motors has increased its stakes in Isuzu and Suzuki as the
core of its strategy to win 10 percent of the Asian car market.
Since Ford raised its stake in Mazda to one-third, it has run the
show.
</P>
<P>
   Now Fuji Heavy Industries, owner of Subaru, which is affiliated
with Nissan, has acknowledged that its offspring needs a foreign
ally _ possibly GM again.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as the firm that has most abjectly thrown its lot in with a
foreigner, Nissan is the one being most carefully watched.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn admits that it is easier for an outsider to make changes,
especially as he had nothing to do with previous attempts to mend
Nissan. Even so, powerful plant managers with seats on the board
have thwarted one ``revival'' after another.
</P>
<P>
   The firm has lost money for four of the past five years. This is
probably its last chance.
</P>
<P>
   The plan for Nissan's revival was greeted with gasps of horror
and disbelief. Yet Nissan's bosses, and the analysts who follow the
firm, have known for a year that something like it would come along
sooner or later.
</P>
<P>
   Like many firms that overinvested during the bubble, when
capital, in effect, cost almost nothing, Nissan has overcapacity of
30-40 percent. Like others, too, it has taken the easy path of
cutting working hours instead of closing plants and laying off
workers.
</P>
<P>
   You do not have to be a rocket scientist to realize that a car
maker able to make 2.4 million vehicles a year in Japan, but
producing fewer than 1.3 million, is running its plants at a
disastrously low level.
</P>
<P>
   To reach 75-80 percent utilization, at which point most car
firms break even, capacity needs to shrink by at least 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Under Ghosn's plan, Nissan's domestic capacity is to drop to a
more realistic 1.65 million units a year by 2002, maybe raising
utilization to 82 percent.
</P>
<P>
   First to go, by March 2001, will be the assembly plants at
Murayama near Tokyo, the Nissan Shatai factory in Kyoto and the
Aichi Kikai Minato plant in Nagoya. Next will be the Kurihama
engine plant in Kanagawa and the Kyushu engine shop in Fukuoka.
</P>
<P>
   By 2002 Ghosn wants Nissan to be turning out a variety of models
using only 15 different ``platforms'' (the costly floor structures
that determine many components) at only four plants. Today, the
firm uses no fewer than 24 platforms at seven different plants.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest savings will come when Renault and Nissan start
sharing platforms. The first to be used jointly will come in 2002
with the replacement of Nissan's Micra and Cube models, and
Renault's new Clio and Twingo models.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, Nissan and Renault then expect to churn out at
least 1 million units a year using one platform. By 2010, they aim
to concentrate their output on ten shared platforms. Yet even then,
Nissan would still be losing money on every car it built in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   With materials and components accounting for more than 60
percent of the cost of making a car, Nissan has to do something
about its fragmented suppliers. So Ghosn intends to cut Nissan's
supplier list from 1,145 firms to no more than 600 within three
years. Suppliers can then spread costs over larger volumes.
</P>
<P>
   By 2002 this is expected to yield a 20 percent saving on
procurement costs, worth $1.7 billion a year. Nissan wants a
further 20 percent reduction in costs by, among other things,
ending the sales incentives that it offers dealers to shift all the
surplus cars it makes.
</P>
<P>
   It will sever relations with a fifth of its domestic-sales
affiliates, shut 10 percent of its retail outlets in Japan,
streamline dealer networks in America and Europe, and give its
advertising to a single agency.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn also intends to sell anything within the group that is
unprofitable or peripheral to its business. Even the firm's highly
regarded aerospace division could be on the block.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the revival aims to trim Nissan's costs by Yen1
trillion and to produce a consolidated operating profit of 4.5
percent of sales by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Will it? &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (225-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 1,025) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A lot could still go wrong. Japanese interest rates cannot stay
low for ever, and with debt of Yen2.6 trillion (including Yen1.2
trillion in the firm's financing division) Nissan is horribly
exposed to any rise.
</P>
<P>
   The company will also be hurt more than most by any further
strengthening of the yen against the dollar. Each one-yen rise in
the rate knocks Yen7 billion off the firm's operating profits.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there any guarantee that Nissan will be able to raise
enough from asset sales to reduce its debts by the Yen700 billion
planned. And Nissan cannot hope to dispose of 16,400 Japanese
workers simply by natural wastage and a freeze on hiring.
</P>
<P>
   Trimming work forces costs around Yen24 million a job, five
times the rate in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians from districts affected by plant closures will

CASINOS ONLY INVITE TROUBLE FOR INDIAN TRIBES 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HARRY ROSENFELD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Constitution proscribes casino gambling
in the state. The document also spells out the kinds of gambling
that are permissible _ Lotto, pari-mutuel racing, charitable bingo,
among others _ and additional rules to keep the gambling that is
allowed from becoming commercialized.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the constitutional restrictions, Indian casino gambling
has been established in two locations in the state and there is a
push to set up a third. Two lawsuits basing their opposition to
Indian casino gambling on constitutional grounds have been filed in
at the entry level of the court system, the state Supreme Court.
More than likely, the final interpretation of the constitution will
be made by the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals, some
distance down the road.
</P>
<P>
   On one side of the argument are the Indian tribes, supported by
Gov. George Pataki and his administration, following in the
footsteps of his predecessor, Mario Cuomo. They base their stand on
the singular economic prosperity that casino gambling promises to
bring to otherwise economically parched reservations, with their
vast numbers of unemployed or underemployed Indians.
</P>
<P>
   They are supported by the U.S. government through its Bureau of
Indian Affairs. Since Congress in 1988 passed the Indian Gaming
Regulatory Act, the bureau has directed the governors of states to
conclude compacts with tribes seeking to set up casinos on their
reservations, which are considered to be sovereign territory.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the governor and some of his deputies to court is a
coalition of strange bedfellows _ the horse racing interests
seeking to protect their turf allied with religious groups making
their stand on moral grounds, along with strict constitutional
constructionists. Extremely interested on the sidelines are the
likes of Donald Trump, trying to guard the revenues of his own
gambling casinos in not-so-far-away Atlantic City, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   One of the arguments made by the plaintiffs is that the U.S.
government has no power to instruct New York's governor to violate
his own constitution. They also argue that even if both houses of
the State Legislature vote to support the compact with the Indians
made by Cuomo and enlarged by Pataki, which they have yet to do,
they would first have to amend the state's constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the New York Constitution, in addition to
forbidding casinos, bars anyone but volunteers from operating or
managing the gambling games. Paid help is not allowed. This is the
opposite of what the Indian enterprises are about.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is not strictly limited to the reservations set up by
treaties and congressional mandate over the past 100 years and
more. By a device, they can buy land far away from their home
grounds, as the St. Regis-Mohawk Tribe is hoping to do in the
Catskills, and have it assumed as an Indian trust territory by
Washington. Then, the Indians can set up casinos in more populated
areas that would provide the multitude of gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   This conflict goes beyond the contentions of the parties
involved. In the first place, it speaks loud and clear to
deprivations of many Native Americans, who are sitting out the
great economic boom. New York state cannot evade doing its share,
along with the federal government, to see that Indians emerge from
their status as second-class citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Providing that help by supporting gambling rights for the
Indians is not solving the problem so much as compounding it.
Instead of marshalling the resources of government to fulfill
obligations, the state becomes a cohort in exploiting the
vulnerable among us. There is ample evidence that the people who
can least afford it are most addicted to gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, organized crime lurks at the edges of casino gambling,
and the New York Constitution takes note of it. So much money can
be involved that the bonanza is a magnet to draw all sorts of funny
money from overseas.
</P>
<P>
   As casino gambling proliferates in the state, it surely would
become a principal contributor to politicians and political
campaigns, buying its way into ever greater insulation from
governmental supervision and restraint. It has happened elsewhere,
why not here?
</P>
<P>
   Even if gambling were a quick fix for some Native-American
travails, it creates a host of nasty problems that will soon enough
undermine the best of intentions.
</P>

`KUNG FU' STAR FINDS NEW ROLE IN TEACHING CHINESE MEDITATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   RHINEBECK, N.Y. _ The spacious lodge is full of aging baby
boomers sitting still in a meditative pose as they follow David
Carradine's every move and directive. He offers four words of
advice: ``Don't forget to breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   No one else laughs, although the actor best known for his role
in the 1970s cult-hit television series ``Kung Fu'' can't help
himself. Sitting in a lotus position on a platform at the front of
the room, he flashes a boyish grin. ``It's important,'' he adds.
``Breathe slowly and deeply.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to dance; extreme activity,'' he says, ``and then we
need to sit; extreme quietness. Try and think about very little, or
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first Friday in October, and stars filled the autumn
sky over the Hudson River Valley. At the Omega Institute, a
campus-style retreat on 140 acres in rural Dutchess County devoted
to holistic studies, Carradine was making his debut. Earlier in the
year, such notables as Deepak Chopra and Robert Bly had been
teaching here.
</P>
<P>
   Carradine was leading a three-day workshop on the inner roots of
tai chi, a centuries-old Chinese fitness and health practice
sometimes described as meditation in motion, and this was the
closing minutes of the opening session.
</P>
<P>
   Both the course and the instructor clearly fascinated the 150 or
so men and women, most of them older than 40, who had paid $225 to
attend the workshop, plus as much as an additional $250 to stay
over for two nights in a cabin at Omega, some 60 miles south of
Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Carradine had brought with him four teachers, including two
martial arts experts who led the group through exercises for most
of the first two hours. But the celebrity who became a devotee of
kung fu and Shaolin philosophy well ahead of the '90s New Age curve
was the reason all had come, hoping to expand their own mind-body
connections and possibly make tai chi a part of their daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest son of one of America's most successful acting
families (his father was character actor John Carradine, who
appeared in such notable films as ``The Grapes of Wrath''; his
younger half-brothers include Keith and Robert Carradine), the
teacher has survived a well-documented marathon struggle with
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   He says he's been sober for more than three years now, and, at
63, David Carradine is lean and wiry, save for a slight paunch. His
cheekbones and high forehead are pronounced, and there is some gray
in the thinning, straight, sandy hair.
</P>
<P>
   Carradine knows how to entertain. He is a raconteur, recalling
how the offbeat TV series (1972-'75) made him aware of kung fu, and
inspired an interest that quickly blossomed into a passion that has
been the one constant in his life for the last quarter-century.
</P>
<P>
   Carradine's stories seem to have no middle or end; they are, it
is safe to say, more free-flowing than tai chi exercises.
</P>
<P>
   He was barefoot, wearing black pants and a black T-shirt with a
large dragon stenciled across the back. An amulet hung around his
neck, and there was a watch on each wrist.
</P>
<P>
   After spending three years on the ``Kung Fu'' TV series, which
shows up regularly on reruns featuring then-unknown guest stars
such as Harrison Ford and Jodie Foster, Carradine turned his
attention to movies.
</P>
<P>
   But other than landing the role of Woody Guthrie in the heralded
``Bound for Glory'' (1976) and teaming up with his brothers and the
Keach and Quaid brothers in the stylistic western ``The Long
Riders'' (1980), this one-time dancer and Broadway actor's career
went backward or nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   So well-known as Kwai Chang Caine, the wandering
Chinese-American warrior-philosopher-priest in the ``Kung Fu''
series, Carradine was reduced to taking parts in mostly forgettable
straight-to-video movies full of high kicks and revenge.
</P>
<P>
   He was also drinking and carrying on, living an out-of-control
existence while at the same time pursuing Chinese martial arts that
are based on harmony and self-discipline. Carradine declined to be
interviewed during his three days at Omega, and it was unclear how
or even whether he explains this seeming paradox.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, speaking to People magazine to promote his
role in ``The New Swiss Family Robinson,'' a made-for-TV movie in
which he played a buccaneer bad guy who menaces the stranded
family, Carradine reflected on his turbulent times:
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't blame it all on the alcohol,'' he said. ``I am an
arrogant son of a b---. I did a hell of a lot of damage and it
wasn't clear if my career was going to survive at all.''
</P>
<P>
   His personal life was in shambles, too, as he was married and
divorced three times. He is now on marriage No. 4, to actress
Marina Benjamin, and he credits her with helping him quit drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Carradine says sobriety has allowed him to mend fences with his
three children: Calista, 37, an actress; Free, 26, a special
effects artist; and Kansas, 21, a student. Free, who also uses the
name Tom, was one of the results of Carradine's highly publicized
six-year relationship with actress Barbara Hershey.
</P>
<P>
   The one vice Carradine has apparently been unable to overcome is
cigarettes. While herbal tea is now his drink of choice, unfiltered
English Oval smokes were never far away. Three times during the
first two-hour session at Omega, while other instructors led the
group, Carradine stepped out of the lodge. The unmistakable smell
of strong tobacco wafted through the open windows.
</P>
<P>
   Carradine promised that during the course, through an extensive
Saturday and Sunday morning, those at the workshop would gain some
insight into how tai chi works, and how important it is ``to get
your own temple in order.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is almost too much New Age for me, but I want to improve
the moment to moment texture of our daily existence,'' he said.
``You need to experience the tension before you can get rid of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lifetime is not long enough to master the art of tai chi.
You'll always have something new happening to your mind and body.
But unlike aerobics or bike riding or something like that, you
won't be stuck in repetition. It's a growing thing. And, unlike
aerobics, you won't have to listen to disco either.''

   &UR; `HAMLET' IS THE BEST `POEM' OF THE MILLENIUM

   It is no betrayal of the form to proclaim ``Hamlet'' the
greatest poem of the millennium. Its lyric structure gives us
Hamlet's high consciousness, tragic and mocking, arching like a
glittering spider web over the dramatic action. Hamlet is always at
the center: All the other figures in the play are there to provoke,
to repudiate, to interrupt his brilliant cascades of language.

   &UR; BYRON AND THE LOST ART OF IMMORTALITY
 &UR; (1,500 words)
 &UR; By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN
</P>
<P>
   By age 36, Lord Byron, the original bad boy of English
literature, had made a nation of repressed women swoon despite his
escapades. Notwithstanding a malformed foot, he was as famous for
his athletic prowess as for his brand of cynicism. He lacked only
one thing to insure his immortality: a really good death. And this
came about with perfect filmic melodrama in 1824. Byron and his era
gave us the cliche of the artist gladly outraging society,
asserting the primacy of his opinion and claiming absolute
indifference to public reaction. These became essential aspects of
Romanticism, and 200 years later they are still entwined in our
definition of creative genius.

   &UR; THE BEST STORY OF THE LAST THOUSAND YEARS
 &UR; (2,000 words)
 &UR; By A.S. BYATT
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thousand and One Nights'' has everything a tale should
have. Sex, death, treachery, humor, surprise and a happy ending.
Though it appears to be a story against women, it actually marks
the creation of one of the strongest and cleverest heroines in
world literature. Scheherazade triumphs because she is endlessly
inventive. Her stories deal with love and life and death and money
and food and all the other human necessities.

<P>
   Seven major images of the millennium have shaped our
understanding of history. All are unforgettable. All, in one way or
another, are about definitive moments not only in individual lives
but also in the lives of all of us. They tell us what human beings
will do to other human beings. Some of it is encouraging. Some of
it isn't. Either way, we get it full in the face.

   &UR; FINALLY, ART THROUGH WOMEN'S EYES
 &UR; (1,300 words)
 &UR; By HOLLAND COTTER
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, in high art, men were the image shapers, and it's
not hard to notice that their pictures of women differ from women's
pictures of women. This is significant when we consider how deeply
our cultural reflexes, and our sexual politics, have been
influenced by images of women: woman as mother, as goddess, as muse
or sex object. Now after centuries of conforming to men's views and
stereotypes, female artists are taking control of their own images.

   &UR; THE `VANISHING POINT' INTRODUCED PERSPECTIVE TO PAINTING
 &UR; (500 words) &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The signal art work of the millennium (let's narrow it down and
stick to the West) no longer exists, and is only mentioned in a
text from the 1480s, a biography of Filippo Brunelleschi. The
Florentine architect is credited with inventing perspective, the
system for representing three dimensions in two, so that, in a
painting or drawing, a beautiful lady's string of pearls would look
closer than the map on the wall. Perspective works by having a
vanishing point, or single spot at which all parallel lines going
from near to far theoretically converge, the effect of which
creates an illusion of depth.

   Who wrote the best comedy of the last thousand years? Well,

   &UR; THE CRUSADES, EVEN NOW, CHURN MODERN LIFE
 &UR; (1,700 words)
 &UR; By KAREN ARMSTRONG
</P>
<P>
   When Pope Urban II summoned the knights of Europe to take part
in the First Crusade in November 1095, he could not have imagined
the enduring effects of his enterprise. The pope hoped a crusade
would bring peace to war-torn Europe and enhance the power of the
Western church. Instead of fighting one another in pointless feudal
wars, the pope believed, the knights should join forces, march to
Jerusalem and rescue Christ's tomb from the infidels. He had
envisioned a conventional military campaign but found to his
astonishment that he had launched a mass movement. With the
Crusades, the West found its soul. But it is their tragic legacy
that is felt most keenly today, particularly in the Middle East.

   &UR; THE LIVES OF THE MYSTIC SAINTS OFFER A CRUEL LESSON FOR TODAY'S
WOMEN
 &UR; (3,600 words)
 &UR; By JENNIFER EGAN
</P>
<P>
   An appetite for self-mortification would prove one of the Saint
Catherine of Siena's most enduring traits, and would lead to her
death, at 33, of starvation. In this respect, Catherine's behavior
in the 14th century foreshadowed that of a great many women today
for whom power and suffering _ often self-inflicted _ are curiously
intertwined. Modern-day anorexics, bulimics and self-injurers
experience an illusion of control through disciplining or
mutilating their bodies, echoing the pious self-punishments of
Catherine's time. The lives of Catherine and other saints like her
can help to explain why these impulses persist among women _ from
athletes and models to Princess Diana _ when both the world and the
position of women in it have been radically transformed.

   &UR; EINSTEIN'S QUESTION: DID GOD HAVE A CHOICE?
 &UR; (1,000 words)
 &UR; By DENNIS OVERBYE
</P>
<P>
   ``What interests me,'' Albert Einstein once remarked, ``is
whether God had any choice in the creation of the world.'' The
question was just his way of asking whether the universe could be
any other way than it appears to be -- and if not, how much room
remains for chance and miracles? There is no reason to think we
will ever be Godlike enough in our comprehension to unlock this
cosmic secret. It may be that humans are fated only to know many
small truths rather than the one big truth, as we spin off
``marvels'' like space flight and the World Wide Web.

   &UR; ON THE ROAD WITH ST. FRANCIS of ASSISI
 &UR; (4,000 words)
 &UR; By GRETEL EHRLICH
</P>
<P>
   The road from Assisi to Gubbio is sometimes a footpath, a horse
track, a Roman street and now, a gravel road that winds through
peaks and valleys dotted with tiny farms and fortresslike
monasteries where 13th-century travelers could spend the night. It
is called the Sentiero Francescano della Pace because it is the
path that Francesco di Bernardone _ better known as St. Francis _
is believed to have taken after he stood naked in Assisi's central
piazza, renounced family and friends and set out on the journey
that effectively defined the rest of his life as wanderer, seeker,
ultimately saint. What is it in a life that leads a medieval
playboy to sainthood, and where does the path begin? That's what
Gretel Ehrlich wondered 800 years later as she stepped onto the
Sentiero and followed Francesco's footsteps out of Assisi.

   &UR; POPE CELESTINE V WAS AN UNWILLING HOLY MAN

<P>
   Celestine V, the only pope in history to have resigned, is the
millennium's best pontiff, according to the author A.N. Wilson. The
85-year-old peasant mystic was elected in 1294, at a time when the
papal throne had been empty for two years, thanks to infighting by
the Mafia-style bosses who ran the medieval church. He resigned
five months later. Dante placed him in Hell for his gran rifuito,
his abdication. But this was an unwilling holy man who knew there
was no meeting place between the pursuit of power and the worship
of God.

   &UR; `CITY ON A HILL' SERMON OFFERED THE BIBLE AS CIVIC BLUEPRINT
 &UR; (1,500 words)
 &UR; By PETER J. GOMES
</P>
<P>
   The definitive sermon of the last 1,000 years was delivered in
1630 when the layman Robert Winthrop, governor of the Massachusetts
Bay Colony, preached to his fellow immigrants while still at sea
aboard the ship Arbella. ``Christian Charity: A Model Hereof,'' is
what Winthrop called his sermon, and it would have languished in
obscurity were it not for its felicitous use of a biblical image _
that of the ``city set on a hill'' _ to describe the moral purpose
of the Pilgrims' adventure into the unknown. That image, familiar
to generations of Christians from Jesus' ``Sermon on the Mount'' in
Matthew's gospel, is what gave Winthrop's sermon life. And it
provided perhaps the most enduring metaphor of the American
experience, that of the exemplary nation _ the ``city on a hill''

   The fact that we can get a connection to anywhere today, almost
instantly, means that we can be got anywhere, all the time. And the
fact that friends and bosses can find us so easily means that it is
ever more difficult to get lost amid the beepers, cell phones and

Ocean on the California coast, tolling bells mark out a centered

   &UR; TRUE LOVE MAY LAST FOREVER, BUT IT HASN'T BEEN AROUND THAT LONG
 &UR; (1,100 words)
 &UR; By JOYCE CAROL OATES
</P>
<P>
   Love in the Western world has come to mean, in the popular
imagination, romantic love almost exclusively. But it may come as a
surprise to learn that the very concept of ``love'' based on
emotion as a high value, and not as an outlaw passion, is
relatively new in the history of mankind. In the ancient world,
romantic love would seem to have been virtually unknown, and rarely
celebrated. Our generic term ``love'' didn't exist. The sentiment
of romantic love as we know it was the homoerotic love of older
Greek men for boys. Marital love, which surely existed, seems oddly
not to have been much honored, at least in surviving literature.

   Why does Heloise, a reluctant, heartbroken 12th-century nun,

because of her shameless intelligence, which won her the right to
be treated as a thinking self at a time when most women were not.
Nor because of her gifts as a classical logician. It is because of
her lifelong refusal to condemn or forget the pleasures of a
passion that ruined her life.

   &UR; THE BEST LOVESONG OF THE MILLENNIUM
 &UR; (750 words)
 &UR; By LORRIE MOORE
</P>
<P>
   Richard Strauss knew that love triangles make the best music,
and proved it in ``Der Rosenkavalier.'' At the opera's penultimate
moment, the older woman (the Marschallin) elegantly gives up her
young lover (Octavian) upon glimpsing him newly in love with
someone his own age (Sophie). Love is simultaneously embraced and
selflessly surrendered in a song that has the melodic depths and
passion of Wagner but the libretto and spirit of Mozart. The clock
has run out on the Marschallin's romantic life. She has had her
chance, her time, and now she must bow out _ how suited to the
close of this last thousand years.

<P>
   The sex scandal of the millennium didn't involve Clintons or
Windsors, although it did involve an English king. This one changed
the laws of God and man, created a saint and destroyed a courtier
of Machiavellian brilliance. It was Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. How
could such a passion ever die? Perhaps, as has been said, ``only
the little loves last.''

MONEY TO BE MADE IN DON'T-DO-IT-YOURSELF LAND 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ My local bookstore has shelves of relationship
books with titles like ``Women Can't Hear What Men Don't Say,''
``It's a Jungle Out There, Jane'' and ``Verbal Abuse Survivors
Speak Out.''
</P>
<P>
   Shut up, wimps. By definition, everyone survives verbal abuse.
Try surviving builders, plumbers, electricians and roofers around
the house.
</P>
<P>
   I was looking for a book on the most important kind of
relationship in the San Francisco Bay Area, the one between
homeowner and contractor. I couldn't find anything on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homeowners are from Chapter 11, Contractors are from Novato''
has yet to be written, and neither has ``Kitchen Remodeling
Survivors Speak Out.''
</P>
<P>
   My wife and I are retaining wall survivors.
</P>
<P>
   We were among the lucky ones. We somehow found a great
contractor who rebuilt our retaining walls, adding value to the
house (as they say) and more importantly preventing the subtraction
of value if El Nino washed the house down the hill.
</P>
<P>
   In two weeks, this guy replaced rotten wood and our bank account
with steel, concrete and pressure-treated fir that would stop
cannonballs. Soon he'll be off to Micronesia for a month, as part
of the three months of vacation he takes each year.
</P>
<P>
   While our contractor is hiking around Yap, I'll be looking at my
retaining wall, trying to recall what was so hard about that shop
class I flunked in junior high school.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago the guy who rebuilt our deck took three weeks
off in the middle of the job to go sailing. He didn't have a bumper
sticker on his boat saying, ``I'd rather be building decks.''
</P>
<P>
   But he eventually built a great deck, and later took us out to
dinner at his yacht club to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a good contractor is harder than finding someone to
love. In these flush times, all the good contractors are taken, as
women always say about men. You can't easily dump a bad contractor,
either. A broken heart mends itself, but not a hole where the roof
used to be.
</P>
<P>
   We've had good luck with our contractors. Not only are they
exceptionally talented and honest in their work, but they're
interesting people.
</P>
<P>
   Our deck man was a former western regional sales manager for a
Fortune 500 company. Our painter was once a philosophy professor.
Our retaining wall guy is a trained engineer, world-traveler and
patron of film festivals.
</P>
<P>
   These guys are all taken, too. And not just by beautiful women,
but by clients. All that dot-com money is pouring into new
bathrooms, extra bedrooms and grotesquely huge new homes built
where little cottages once stood.
</P>
<P>
   There are two kinds of people who hire contractors. There are
those of us who bought a fixer-upper fully loaded with peeling
paint, leaky roof, sagging deck and ancient wiring and plumbing. We
fix one thing at a time by triage method, as we squirrel away
money.
</P>
<P>
   Our houses are like the Golden Gate Bridge. Once we finish
everything, it'll be time to put on paint and a roof again.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are those who rip up a perfectly good house and start
over. One of my neighbors has been building additions, walls and
gates on her house for three years and the place still isn't
finished.
</P>
<P>
   Her contractor is a wonderful young man, and I understand the
impulse to keep such a handy guy around as long as there's money in
the market and outdoor Tuscan ovens to build. If I were rich,
though, I'd want to buy a finished house, just as I'd want a
finished Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   To tell the truth, I'm not the one to write the contractor
relationship book. My contribution to the retaining wall affair was
to do some talking after work with the contractor and put out
coolers of soft drinks for him and his workers.
</P>
<P>
   I'd say things like, ``Sure, we might as well widen the
driveway. Two thousand extra, sure.''
</P>
<P>
   My wife, who works at home, is the real retaining wall survivor.
She had to be there all day, listening to the drilling and letting
in guys to use the bathroom. We're not the outhouse upper class. We
couldn't afford a prestigious Porta-Potty, sign of the big-time
remodeling job.
</P>
<P>
   And when it comes to money, my wife is the one who cares about
details like how much crushed granite costs. She's always the tough
guy in financial matters.
</P>
<P>
   My wife lets them know we care about where every dollar goes _
in our house, that is. She doesn't care if it eventually goes into
the Micronesian economy.
</P>
<P>
   What we have here, then, is the eternal Bay-Area triangle _ a
couple and a contractor.
</P>
<P>
   If I did write the book, the title would be: ``I'm OK, You're
OK, but I'll Have to Get my Wife's OK.''

   In wiping away the undoubted masculine tilt to a thousand years

our language reflect a belated sense of fairness, should we tell

should we use an egg metaphor at all in this discussion?)

   There have been many ``great'' speeches on momentous occasions:
Patrick Henry's ``Give me liberty or give me death!'' Or Lincoln's
``Four score and seven years ago ...'' Or even Robert Emmet's
gallows speech, ``Let no man write my epitaph!'' But there were
also some shorter remarks made by lesser-known figures that sparkle
in the sands of our time. William Safire casts an appreciative nod
toward George Graham Vest, who, as a young lawyer, made ``a
sentimental little speech that is the best I can find of its
kind.'' It was a tribute to a dog.

   &UR; REFLECTING ON THE FALL AND RISE OF `SELF'
 &UR; (1,000 words)
 &UR; By WILLIAM SAFIRE
</P>
<P>
   ``Self'' used to be a dirty word. ``I celebrate myself,'' Walt
Whitman sang in his ''Song of Myself.'' Since then, however, the
notion of self as something to be celebrated has been taking a
beating. We think it is bad to be selfish, good to be selfless. And
yet, ``self'' is making a comeback. Showing some self-confidence,
it has even become the name of a Conde Nast magazine aimed at women
interested in their own bodies and minds.

   &UR; REBIRTH AND REDEMPTION FOR SOME BATTERED WORDS
 &UR; (1,000 words)
 &UR; By WILLIAM SAFIRE
</P>
<P>
   The word ``adventurer'' has had a wild ride through the
millennium. Not that long ago ``adventurer'' meant a brawler, a
plunderer, and even the Devil himself. But today, an adventurer is
no longer a person to be feared. The word has reasserted the
romantic, courageous quality that the poet Keats once gave it.
Meanwhile, ``hellmouth'' is an archaic word that has returned to
vogue as a result of a popular TV series.

   &UR; BEST TIME TO BE ALIVE? `NO TIME LIKE THE PAST'
 &UR; (1,900 words)
 &UR; (A Panel moderated by RUSSELL BAKER) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Has there been in the last thousand years a single best time to
be alive? In this age of faith in progress, it's easy to answer
quickly: Yes, right now. But does that response stand up to
informed comparison with past times? How about the Ming Dynasty? Or
Puritan New England? To answer this tantalizing question,
Pulitzer-Prize winning columnist Russell Baker moderates a panel
discussion of brilliant scholars who tell us when and where they'd
have lived, given the choice. 1,900 words.

   &UR; BEST QUESTION: DID GOD HAVE A CHOICE?
 &UR; (1,000 words)
 &UR; By DENNIS OVERBYE
</P>
<P>
   ``What interests me,'' Albert Einstein once remarked, ``is
whether God had any choice in the creation of the world.'' The
question was just his way of asking whether the universe could be
any other way than it appears to be -- and if not, how much room
remains for chance and miracles? There is no reason to think we
will ever be Godlike enough in our comprehension to recognize the
cosmic secret. It may be that humans are fated only to know many
small truths rather than the one big truth, as we spin off
``marvels'' like space flight and the World Wide Web.

   &UR; BYRON AND THE LOST ART OF IMMORTALITY
 &UR; (1,500 words)
 &UR; By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN
</P>
<P>
   By age 36, Lord Byron, the original bad boy of English
literature, had made a nation of repressed women swoon despite his
escapades. Notwithstanding a malformed foot, he was as famous for
his athletic prowess as for his brand of cynicism. He lacked only
one thing to insure his immortality: a really good death. And this
came about with perfect filmic melodrama in 1824. Byron and his era
gave us the cliche of the artist gladly outraging society,
asserting the primacy of his opinion and claiming absolute
indifference to public reaction. These became essential aspects of
Romanticism, and 200 years later they are still entwined in our
definition of creative genius.

</P>
<P>
   No doubt, the printing press is one of the greatest inventions
in history. Just think of its enormous consequences. Without
printing, millions of people wouldn't have read Martin Luther's 95
Theses, the Declaration of Independence, the Communist Manifesto or
other world-changing texts. Without printing, we wouldn't have
modern science. But Johannes Gutenberg does not deserve sole credit
for inventing it. He reinvented a technique previously developed in
Minoan Crete around 1700 B.C., if not long before that.

   &UR; TRUE LOVE MAY LAST FOREVER, BUT IT HASN'T BEEN AROUND THAT LONG
 &UR; (1,100 words)
 &UR; By JOYCE CAROL OATES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Love in the Western world has come to mean, in the popular
imagination, romantic love almost exclusively. But it may come as a
surprise to learn that the very concept of ``love'' based on
emotion as a high value, and not as an outlaw passion, is
relatively new in the history of mankind. In the ancient world,
romantic love would seem to have been virtually unknown, and rarely
celebrated. Our generic term ``love'' didn't exist. The sentiment
of romantic love as we know it was the homoerotic love of older
Greek men for boys. Marital love, which surely existed, seems oddly
not to have been much honored, at least in surviving literature.

   The most important idea of this millennium was set in motion by

   Thanks to Mohandas K. Gandhi, the peacemaker, India won its
freedom without firing a shot. He has been mythologized since his

one of the most important phenomena of modern history: the
simultaneous assault on colonialism and on the oppression of
individuals, which has transformed much of the 20th-century world.

   Some treaties mark the birth of whole new concepts of

end to the Thirty Years' War, the deadliest conflict in history
until then, in which perhaps 10 million people died. It also
ushered in the modern state system that governs our world _ the
very system that is now, 350 years later, being undermined by
transnational forces like the euro, the Internet and Amnesty
International.

   &UR; MOST IMPORTANT BATTLE OF THE MILLENNIUM
 &UR; (800 WORDS)
 &UR; By R.W. APPLE JR.
</P>
<P>
   Much was at stake when Burgoyne rolled the dice and lost the
Battle of Saratoga. As a result, France entered the war on the
American side and Washington and his ragtag army at Valley Forge
saw the road to ultimate victory. The millennium would see other
great battles, such as Gettysburg and D-Day. But in the last 1,000
years, I think, only the defeat of the Turks by Jan Sobieski near
Vienna in 1683 rivaled Saratoga. It turned back the tide of Islam.
Saratoga did more. It launched two centuries of revolution
elsewhere. It marked the beginning of the end of the British
Empire. And it breathed life into the United States of America.

 &UR; By MARGARET ATWOOD
</P>
<P>
   Every time we try to implement ``utopia'' on a grand scale, we
accomplish its disastrous opposite. Perhaps that is why the word
itself means ``no place.'' The best utopia of the last thousand
years may well have been built by the Shakers, a breakaway group of
Quakers who went to America in 1774 under the leadership of
``Mother'' Ann Lee. They were a kindly, melodious and harmless
bunch. They were pacifists; they didn't try to impose their ideas
by force. They made a lasting contribution to furniture design and
music, which is more than some can say, and best of all, they were
self-limiting.

   ``What really interests me,'' Albert Einstein once remarked,
``is whether God had any choice in the creation of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Few scientists have ever poised their ambitions as poetically or
as nakedly as Einstein, who spoke sometimes as if God were someone
he met for coffee every day. When he spoke of God, however, the
last thing he had in mind was a white-bearded man sitting up in
Heaven toting up sins and dispensing favors to prayerful
supplicants.
</P>
<P>
   The question was just his way of asking whether the universe
could be any other way than it appears to be _ and if not, how much
room remains in that universe for things like chance and miracles?
</P>
<P>
   Is it just pure luck that our own universe has the friendly
qualities it does, or if we knew all the laws of physics from a
Godlike perspective, would we know that the universe could not be
any other way? Would we know why atoms are small and galaxies are
big? Would we know not just how, but why the universe began?
</P>
<P>
   For Einstein, the only conceivable answer to these concrete
questions was yes.
</P>
<P>
   History teaches that most ideas are flops, in science and
otherwise. But every once in a while a hunch that began as pure
thought, a wild gem of poetry about the way nature should be,
blossoms into a theory that turns out to fit the world so
miraculously that its authors cannot help feeling that they have
tapped into the secret order of reality _ into God's ``mind,'' as
Stephen Hawking once put it.
</P>
<P>
   Einstein knew that giddy feeling back in 1915 when he realized
that his theory of general relativity correctly predicted a
puzzling motion of the planet Mercury that had bedeviled
astronomers for decades; he later confessed to a friend that he had
had heart palpitations.
</P>
<P>
   Today those same palpitations are being provoked in his
successors by something called M theory, a shadowy concept posited
to lie at the end of a mathematical labyrinth known as
superstrings. The theory seems to contain everything that
physicists ever wanted to know about the forces of nature but were
afraid to ask.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, nobody claims to know what M theory actually will
say, only that it seems to be there at the end of the mathematical
rainbow, still undiscovered, a metaphysical headwaters of the Nile.
The source perhaps of the River Why.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are many reasons to wonder if the River Why can
ever be drained. Every great triumph of adventure in thought, as
Alfred North Whitehead called general relativity, has invariably
bred a new batch of questions.
</P>
<P>
   There is no reason to think that we are at the end of the cycle
yet, and no guarantee that we are or ever will be Godlike enough in
our comprehension to recognize the cosmic secret if it were carved
on a tree trunk. It may be that humans are fated only to know many
small truths rather than one big truth about the universe, while we
spin off ancillary marvels like space flight, gene therapy and the
World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   A God with no choice, of course, might seem to be a cold comfort
or even no God at all, at least in the traditional sense. In fact,
Einstein noted that a well-ordered universe left no room for
``causes of a divine nature.''
</P>
<P>
   What role then is left for God? Only the main role. To Einstein,
God was a code word for the mystery and grandeur of the universe,
the wellspring of awe, a reminder that there was something at the
core of existence that all his equations could only graze, as he
said once, ``something we cannot penetrate.''
</P>
<P>
   All our science, Einstein often pointed out, would never
vanquish that mystery or slake our thirst for something beyond.
Written on a blackboard or a T-shirt, the so-called theory of
everything would just lie there waiting for something else to
breathe life into it and the universe.
</P>
<P>
   It would not tell us what we really want to know: Does God love
us? Do our lives have any meaning? Nor would it even tell us that
science itself has any value. The idea that the universe makes
sense, of course, is the sheerest faith of all. The most
incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is
comprehensible, Einstein remarked. In reality, we will probably
never know the answer to his question.
</P>
<P>
   We will always be stuck in the middle of an endless journey, not
knowing whether the final answer is just around the corner or a
million miles away or whether we are just going in circles with our
excellent particle accelerators and ingenious mathematics,
projecting our own wishes for form onto chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, modern cosmological theories seem to suggest that our
universe is not unique, but might be only one among an almost
infinite variety of worlds _ worlds in which atoms are the size of
bumblebees and all stars are black holes, worlds of 3 or 6 or 11
dimensions, worlds forever inaccessible to our probing eyes.
</P>
<P>
   But science is nothing if not the search for reasons, for the
smoking gene in our coiled cells, the atom of consciousness, the
quantum butterfly flapping its wings at the heart of the world. It
is the job of scientists to believe in answers. But like card
players with an incomplete knowledge of how the cards lie,
physicists are forced to play their cards as if there were a way to
win the game of science.
</P>
<P>
   Without faith that there is order, as Einstein pointed out, the
enterprise is doomed anyway. But with that faith, as Einstein
proved, it is possible to change the world.

 THE BEST TIME to be ALIVE: `No Time Like the Past' (A Panel
Moderated by RUSSELL BAKER)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (To purchase this ``separate buy'' article from the New York
Times Syndicate please contact syndicate sales representative DEBRA

</P>
<P>
   &UR; FROM: The New York Times Magazine &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Has there been in the last thousand years a single best time to
be alive? In this age of faith in progress, it's easy to answer
quickly: Yes, right now. But does that almost automatic response
stand up to informed comparison with past times?
</P>
<P>
   To answer this question, The New York Times Magazine convened a
panel, moderated by the longtime New York Times columnist Russell
Baker, comprising the following scholars:
</P>
<P>
   _ Thomas Cahill, author of ``The Gifts of the Jews'' and ``How
the Irish Saved Civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Ann Douglas, professor of English and comparative literature
at Columbia, and author of ``Terrible Honesty: Mongrel Manhattan in
the 1920s.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Elaine Pagels, professor of religion at Princeton, and author
of ``The Origin of Satan.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Orlando Patterson, professor of sociology at Harvard, and
author of ``Rituals of Blood: Consequences of Slavery in Two
American Centuries.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Jonathan Spence, professor of history at Yale, and author of
``The Chan's Great Continent: China in Western Minds.''
</P>
<P>
   RUSSELL BAKER: None of us are living in this time by choice.
We're here because of somebody else's decision. Maybe, given our
druthers, we would prefer to be somewhere else _ I would bet in
most cases not in the future. The idea is to debate a little about
the ideal time to live in, if you had your own choice.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose some people would say this is the ideal time. I'm
prepared to argue against that, but for the most part I'm here to
listen to your opinions. Mr. Spence, you would probably like to go
back in time?
</P>
<P>
   JONATHAN SPENCE: Absolutely. I would be very interested to live
my life in Hangzhou. I know where my villa is going to be: on the
west side of the lake in the hills, looking down on what was then a
totally unpolluted lake, and what was a kind of large and
prosperous rural pleasure resort. A beautiful city.
</P>
<P>
   BAKER: What year is it on the Christian calendar?
</P>
<P>
   SPENCE: I would be born around 1540. One of the problems here is
I'd like to have a bit of money. I don't want too much, because the
official agents from Beijing would take it away from me. This was
one of the most urbane and cultured times in all of Chinese
history.
</P>
<P>
   I've always studied the Manchu Dynasty and modern China and the
revolution, and that was from 1644. But I would like to live in the
Ming Dynasty _ not knowing, of course, that the Ming was going to
fall. So I do need to die shortly before 1644. That was a great
time of scholarship, and it was also a great time for scholarship
for women.
</P>
<P>
   If it's all right, I want to be married to my real-life wife at
the same time, but my Chinese language would be much better in this
life. As a couple, we're always going to be able to play elegant
poetry games, word games that the Chinese have always loved to
play.
</P>
<P>
   And the reading _ the texts about that 16th-century period in
Hangzhou show an amazingly energized society. People read very
widely. It's a magnificent period in painting. The food is
magnificent. It is not a slave society. Booze is available but not
excessive. It's pre-opium, no heavy narcotics. And the distribution
of food in that region is efficient. It was a rich time to live.
</P>
<P>
   BAKER: It sounds like a paradise. How about you, Mr. Cahill?
</P>
<P>
   THOMAS CAHILL: Sticking within the confines of the last thousand
years, I find myself drawn to the 14th century. I would love to
have gone to a Christmas party in medieval London with Geoffrey
Chaucer. I would love to have been around when Giotto began to
paint _ this man, influenced by the spiritual realism of Francis of
Assisi, asking himself: What do human beings really look like? And
then trying to make them in that way. I would love to have been
there when Joan of Arc began to muster the troops.
</P>
<P>
   BAKER: They burned her.
</P>
<P>
   ELAINE PAGELS: I think that this would be a fascinating journey,
but I'd want to go with a full set of inoculations and an American
passport.
</P>
<P>
   CAHILL: How long do you want to be present?
</P>
<P>
   BAKER: Since this is an intellectual exercise, I think you have
to assume that you're going to be part of the culture of the time.
We'd all like to cruise around and watch Columbus come ashore.
</P>
<P>
   CAHILL: I find it difficult to reduce myself to one spot.
</P>
<P>
   DOUGLAS: But we all are reduced to one spot. And you'd live how
long? Thirty years in about 1390? You'd hardly have time to get
around to see everything you said you wanted to see.
</P>
<P>
   SPENCE: In Hangzhou, there were long-lived people, maybe 90 year
olds, edging 100. They also had wonderful food, which didn't even
require teeth! Delicious rice pilaf dishes, soft lotus-root dishes.
</P>
<P>
   BAKER: Mr. Patterson?
</P>
<P>
   ORLANDO PATTERSON: I chose three periods, excluding the period
following the civil rights movement in America. That has obviously
been the best time for Afro-Americans, but sticking to it would rid
the discussion of any fun. Working backward, my third choice would
have been to be a moderately prosperous New England farmer who
lived around 1750 to 1830 _ embracing the Revolutionary period.
</P>
<P>
   I would have been about 26 in 1776, so I would have fought in
the Revolutionary War. I would like to have had the opportunity to
talk intellectually with Madison, to club with Hamilton, to tell
Jefferson what a fraud I thought he was _ that really, it's not
fair that he should have a place in history just because he wrote a
great paragraph.
</P>
<P>
   My second choice is to have lived in Tokugawa, Japan, about the
18th century. I would not want to have been a samurai. By then,
they were no longer warriors; they were basically quasi
bureaucrats. And I wouldn't particularly care for the official
culture that the shogun imposed, although it was quite fascinating
_ those tea ceremonies. They would have been far too restrictive
for me.
</P>
<P>
   I would like to have been a moderately prosperous merchant
around the 1730s, participating in what the Japanese call the
floating world, which is a kind of counterculture to the official
world imposed by the shogunate. They had a ball!
</P>
<P>
   I'd have been drawn to Kabuki dramas, to the fashion, to the way
they subverted the official ideology so that when the shogun said,
``You can no longer wear fancy clothes; you have to wear cotton if
you're a merchant,'' they wore cotton on the outside and silk on
the inside.
</P>
<P>
   I think the life expectancy may well have been much better
living in Japan at that time than in Europe. And it was a very
peaceful period. They threw out the Europeans and were able to
develop their own culture.
</P>
<P>
   Now I come to my first choice. It's in the 14th century. It's a
city-state that produced some of the most beautiful art in the
world. Can you guess?
</P>
<P>
   PAGELS: Siena?
</P>
<P>
   PATTERSON: No. I wouldn't want to be in Renaissance Italy if you
paid me. There were towns where a third to a half of the population
was dropping dead from the plague!
</P>
<P>
   The little city-state I had in mind would have been the town of
Ife in Yorubaland, in what's now western Nigeria, somewhere about
the mid-to-late 14th century. I would want to have been a sculptor,
one of the people who produced those incredible bronze heads or the
terra-cotta work that you now can see in the British Museum. Again,
the life expectancy would have quite possibly been higher than for
a working man in Europe at that time.
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice to have been a bourgeois gentleman in Holland
during the golden 17th and early 18th centuries, having your
portrait done by one of their great painters, but they were
involved with the slave trade. The same was true of the British.
</P>
<P>
   You think about being an entrepreneur in late 18th- and
19th-century England. You saw this incredible transformation, the
Industrial Revolution; the steam engine and all the rest. The
trouble is, one can't help thinking about the plight of the
displaced masses and the kids who were being sent down into the
mines.
</P>
<P>
   BAKER: I wonder if I could change the focus to the idea of
progress. Do we all believe in progress?
</P>
<P>
   SPENCE: It seems to me it's not so much comfort or progress that
we're talking about; it's those who actually are drawn to live in a
period of extraordinary change and struggle vs. those who, I think,
want a period of enormous cultural subtlety and development.
</P>
<P>
   I tilt toward the latter, a time in which the culture is still
immensely lively, but the idea of progress would not exactly be the
point.
</P>
<P>
   CAHILL: I would speak for progress. We are at the end of the
bloodiest of all centuries, to be sure. And it is not a universal
consciousness, by any means, but I think there is a consciousness
of the necessity for peace.

 By JARED DIAMOND  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 c.1999 Jared Diamond  
<TEXT>
<P>
   My 11-year-old twin sons just told me what they learned today in
school. ``Daddy, Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press,
and that was one of the greatest inventions in history.''
</P>
<P>
   I learned that too when I was a child. I suspect that the same
view is taught in most other American and European schools. What we
are told about printing is partly true, or at least defensible.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I would rate it as the best single ``invention'' of
this millennium. Just think of its enormous consequences for modern
societies. Without printing, millions of people wouldn't have read
quickly, with no transmission errors, Martin Luther's 95 Theses,
the Declaration of Independence, the Communist Manifesto or other
world-changing texts. Without printing, we wouldn't have modern
science.
</P>
<P>
   Without printing, Europeans might not have spread over the globe
since 1492, because consolidation of initial European conquests
required the emigration of thousands of would-be conquistadors
motivated by written accounts of Pizarro's capture of the Incan
emperor Atahualpa.
</P>
<P>
   So I agree with half of what my kids were taught _ the part
about the importance of printing. But things get more complicated
when you credit this invention specifically to Gutenberg, or even
when you credit him with just the printing press itself. Gutenberg
did much more than invent the printing press _ and much less than
invent printing.
</P>
<P>
   A more accurate rendering of his achievements would be something
like the following legalistic sentence: ``Gutenberg played a major
practical and symbolic role in independently reinventing, in a
greatly improved form and within a more receptive society, a
printing technique previously developed in Minoan Crete around 1700
B.C., if not long before that.''
</P>
<P>
   Why did Gutenbergian printing take off while Minoan printing
didn't? Therein lies a fascinating story that punctures our usual
image of the lonely and heroic inventor: Gutenberg, James Watt,
Thomas Edison.
</P>
<P>
   Through his contribution to the millennium's best invention,
Gutenberg gave us the millennium's best window into how inventions
actually unfold. Even American and European schoolchildren reared
on Gutenberg hagiography soon learn that China had printing long
before Gutenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese printing is known to go back to around the second
century A.D., when Buddhist texts on marble pillars began to be
transferred to the new Chinese invention of paper via smeared ink.
By the year 868, China was printing books.
</P>
<P>
   But most Chinese printers carved or otherwise wrote out a text
on a wooden block instead of assembling it letter by letter as
Gutenberg did (and as almost all subsequent printers using
alphabetic scripts have also done). Hence the credit for what
Gutenberg invented is also corrected from ``printing'' to
``printing with movable type'': That is, printing with individual
letters that can be composed into texts, printed, disassembled and
reused.
</P>
<P>
   Have we now got the story right? No, Gutenberg still doesn't
deserve credit even for that. By about 1041, the Chinese alchemist
Pi Sheng had devised movable type made of a baked-clay-and-glue
amalgam. Among the subsequent inventors who improved on Pi Sheng's
idea were Korea's King Htai Tjong (cast-bronze type, around 1403)
and the Dutch printer Laurens Janszoon (wooden type with
hand-carved letters, around 1430).
</P>
<P>
   From all those inventors, it's convenient (and, I think,
appropriate) to single out Gutenberg for special credit because of
his advances _ the use of a press, a technique for mass-producing
durable metal letters, a new metal alloy for the type and an
oil-based printing ink. We also find it convenient to focus on
Gutenberg as a symbol because he can be considered to have launched
book production in the West with his beautiful Bible of 1455.
</P>
<P>
   But a form of printing with movable type was invented far
earlier by an unnamed printer of ancient Crete in the Minoan age.
The proof of Minoan printing can be found in a single baked-clay
disk, six inches in diameter. Found buried deep in the ruins of a
1700 B.C. palace at Phaistos on Crete, the disk is covered on both
sides with remarkable spiraling arrays of 241 symbols constituting
45 different ``letters'' (actually, syllabic signs), which were not
deciphered until a couple of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A recent decipherment identifies the signs' language as an
ancient form of Greek that predates even Homer.
</P>
<P>
   Astonishingly, the symbols of the Phaistos disk weren't
scratched into the clay by hand, as was true of most ancient
writing on clay, but were instead printed by a set of punches, one
for each of the 45 signs. Evidently, some ancient Cretan
predecessor of Pi Sheng beat him to the idea by 2,741 years.
</P>
<P>
   Why did Minoan printing die out? Why was Renaissance Europe
ready to make use of the millennium's best invention while Minoan
Crete was not?
</P>
<P>
   Technologically,the Minoans' hand-held punches were clumsy. The
early Minoan writing system itself, a syllabary rather than an
alphabet, was so ambiguous that it could be read by few people and
used for only very particular kinds of texts, perhaps only tax
lists and royal propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese printing's usefulness was similarly limited by China's
own nonalphabetic writing system. To make Minoan printing efficient
would have required technological advances that did not occur until
much later, like the creation of paper, an alphabet, improved inks,
metals and presses.
</P>
<P>
   I mentioned that Gutenberg is part not only of the millennium's
best invention but also of its best insight into how our usual view
of inventions often misses the point. Coming up with an invention
itself may be the easy part; the real obstacle to progress may
instead be a particular society's capacity to utilize the
invention.
</P>
<P>
   Other famously premature inventions include wheels in
pre-Columbian Mexico (relegated to play toys because Mexican
Indians had no draft animals) and Cro-Magnon pottery from 25,000
B.C. (What nomadic hunter-gatherer really wants to carry pots?)
</P>
<P>
   The technological breakthroughs leading to great inventions
usually come from totally unrelated areas. For instance, if a queen
of ancient Crete had launched a Minoan Manhattan Project to achieve
mass literacy through improved printing, she would never have
thought to emphasize research into cheese, wine and olive presses _
but those presses furnished prototypes for Gutenberg's most
original contribution to printing technology.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, American military planners trying to build powerful
bombs in the 1930s would have laughed at suggestions that they
finance research into anything so arcane as transuranic elements.
</P>
<P>
   We picture inventors as heroes with the genius to recognize and
solve a society's problems. In reality, the greatest inventors have
been tinkerers who loved tinkering for its own sake and who then
had to figure out what, if anything, their devices might be good
for.
</P>
<P>
   The prime example is Thomas Edison, whose phonograph is widely
considered to be his most brilliant invention. When he built his
first one, in 1877, it was not in response to a national clamor for
hearing Beethoven at home. Having built it, he wasn't sure what to
do with it, so he drew up a list of 10 uses, like recording the
last words of dying people, announcing the time and teaching
spelling.
</P>
<P>
   When entrepreneurs used his invention to play music, Edison
thought it was a debasement of his idea.
</P>
<P>
   Our widespread misunderstanding of inventors as setting out to
solve society's problems causes us to say that necessity is the
mother of invention. Actually, invention is the mother of
necessity, by creating needs that we never felt before. (Be honest:
did you really feel a need for your Walkman CD player long before
it existed?)
</P>
<P>
   Far from welcoming solutions to our supposed needs, society's
entrenched interests commonly resist inventions. In Gutenberg's
time, no one was pleading for a new way to churn out book copies:
There were hordes of copyists whose desire not to be put out of
business led to local bans on printing.
</P>
<P>
   The first internal-combustion engine was built in 1867, but no
motor vehicles came along for decades, because the public was
content with horses and railroads. Transistors were invented in the
United States, but the country's electronics industry ignored them
to protect its investment in vacuum-tube products; it was left to
Sony in bombed-out postwar Japan to adapt transistors to
consumer-electronics products.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers of typing keyboards continue to prefer our
inefficient qwerty layout to a rationally designed one.
</P>
<P>
   All these misunderstandings about invention pervade our science
and technology policies. Every year, officials decry some areas of
basic research as a waste of tax dollars and urge that we instead
concentrate on ``solving problems'': that is, applied research.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, much applied research is necessary to translate basic
discoveries into workable products _ a prime example being the
Manhattan Project, which spent three years and $2 billion to turn
Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassman's discovery of nuclear fission into
an atomic bomb.
</P>
<P>
   All too often, however, the world fails to realize that neither
the solutions to most difficult problems of technology nor the
potential uses of most basic research discoveries have been
predictable in advance. Instead, penicillin, X-rays and many other
modern wonders were discovered accidentally _ by tinkerers driven
by curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   So forget those stories about genius inventors who perceived a
need of society, solved it single-handedly and transformed the
world. There has never been such a genius; there have only been
processions of replaceable creative minds who made serendipitous or
incremental contributions.
</P>
<P>
   If Gutenberg himself hadn't devised the better alloys and inks
used in early printing, some other tinkerer with metals and oils
would have done so. For the best invention of the millennium, do
give Gutenberg some of the credit _ but not too much.

 &HT;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The greatest poem of the millennium?
</P>
<P>
   It is no betrayal of the lyric if I name ``Hamlet,'' a work as
lyric as it is dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   Its ``carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,/... accidental
judgements, casual slaughters'' _ I quote from the play _ make up
the linear plot, but its lyric structure gives us ``the book and
volume'' of Hamlet's high consciousness, tragic and mocking,
arching like a glittering spider web over the dramatic action.
</P>
<P>
   Though the dramatic Hamlet is provoked by a murder, the lyric
Hamlet is moved by all deaths: death walking like a ghost,
disinterred in a skull, slumping behind an arras, floating on a
brook, hanging on a baited sword, waiting in a poisoned chalice.
</P>
<P>
   Hamlet believes only in death _ not in the Christian afterlife
that was part of the ideology of his century.
</P>
<P>
   For him, the single question is, To be or not to be. Mortality
is one uneasiness in him, murder the other, and it scarcely matters
in the end whether mortality comes by murder, since what vexes
Hamlet is mortality itself.
</P>
<P>
   Even the flesh of a king ``may go a progress through the guts of
a beggar''; ultimately everything human comes to death, to the
sun-kissing carrion and the omnivorous worm.
</P>
<P>
   Czeslaw Milosz, with distaste and irony, identifies the European
cultural moment to which Hamlet belongs as a time when there arises
``a fringe of the aristocracy cultivating literature and art,
elegant, freed from the coarser superstitions.'' Those ``coarser
superstitions'' still clothe the ghost of Hamlet's father, working
on Hamlet from the outside, and Shakespeare is tender toward the
guards' medieval wonder at the peace of the Christmas season when
no ghosts appear, ``so hallowed and so gracious is the time.''
</P>
<P>
   But for his own part, Hamlet _ even after seeing the ghost _
speaks merely of bad dreams that may come in the sleep of death.
The remnants of belief have been scotched by his mordant university
learning. In its repudiation of Christian consolation, ``Hamlet''
marks the philosophical turning point of our Western millennium:
the moment in which that reflective skepticism so repellent to
Milosz (who nonetheless shares it) becomes intellectually dominant.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the collapse of religious authority comes social
revolution: ``The toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the
courtier he galls his kibe.''
</P>
<P>
   Only ``Hamlet,'' of Shakespeare's greatest plays, is ruled by a
single lyric consciousness. The Macbeths are two; Hal and Falstaff
are two; Antony and Cleopatra are two; Desdemona, Othello and Iago
are a triad; and ``Lear'' is full of doubles and triads. Hamlet has
no sibling, wife or lieutenant jointly pursuing revenge with him:
his reflective loneliness and his lyric status elicit his
soliloquies.
</P>
<P>
   Hamlet is always at the center: All the other figures in the
play are there to provoke, to repudiate, to interrupt his brilliant
cascades of language. Directors reflect this lyric shape in their
closing tableau of the characters on stage: Hamlet falls at the
center (with Horatio at his side), and disposed about him we see
the bodies of Claudius, Gertrude and Laertes.
</P>
<P>
   In the wings lurk all the other dead of the play: old Fortinbras
(murdered by old Hamlet); old Hamlet (murdered by Claudius);
Polonius, Rosencranz and Guildenstern (murdered _ the last two at
one remove _ by Hamlet); and Ophelia, dead by suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hamlet'' is, then, our pre-eminent post-Christian poem,
refusing both the redemptive linear plot of Christianity _ by which
God brings good out of evil _ and the stable political hierarchy
implicit in the Christian belief that regal authority is derived
from God.
</P>
<P>
   Like most lyric poems, ``Hamlet'' exhibits a recursive
structure: The deathblow repeats itself in the fortune of each main
character; the morbid dumb show and the ``mousetrap'' play
replicate the main murder plot; and the open graves of the innocent
Yorick and Ophelia serve as gaping symbols of the tragedy's
continual undersong of grief.
</P>
<P>
   Emily Dickinson once wrote, ``He has found his Future who has
found Shakespeare.'' It is our own future predicament that we find
in this great dramatic poem, as we hear Hamlet's lyric obbligato
musing over the gravediggers' stage.

WILL THE INTERNET MARK A TURNING POINT FOR WOMEN?  
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
   By ESTHER DYSON  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 c.1999 Esther Dyson  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not long ago, Ann Winblad, a successful venture capitalist well
known on the high-tech circuit, stood up to speak at a conference.
She tapped the microphone and inquired sweetly, ``Does this pick up
women's voices?''
</P>
<P>
   If Winblad, with a sterling track record and millions yet to
invest, can ask that, consider what it's like for most women.
</P>
<P>
   We now get the mike at conferences in part because organizers
are consciously trying to balance things, and in part because many
of us simply deserve it _ but over all, women still have trouble
being heard.
</P>
<P>
   Can cyberspace change that? Or will it, like so many other tools
and technologies, simply become a way for the old order to
reinforce itself?
</P>
<P>
   Powerful tools in powerful hands tend to increase the
concentration of power, but the Internet isn't just a tool. It's a
medium that may change the balance of power.
</P>
<P>
   Consider some history. Long ago, women's work was defined by
women's bodies. They bore children and were generally weaker.
Gradually, as work became less physical and personal service became
a commodity rather than something one did at home, women joined the
work force as nurses, servants and governesses.
</P>
<P>
   As the world industrialized and dexterity began to matter more
than strength, they became machine operators. In many semiconductor
plants, especially overseas in countries where discrimination is
legal, women are still preferred today for their smaller fingers
and the precision with which they can work. And as work began to
include information, many women became telephone operators,
typists, clerks and secretaries.
</P>
<P>
   Then economic pressures started changing society and social
changes began affecting work patterns. As our economy has grown and
become ever more competitive, the stock market and other pressures
are focusing on performance rather than status, and capable women
have begun to get the work they deserve.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, people are promoted more for performance;
businesses can't afford to do otherwise in a competitive market.
Women can get good jobs based on performance _ at least up to the
highest reaches of many companies.
</P>
<P>
   I wish that were reliably true. Twenty years ago, we thought
that the high-tech world would by now be different, that women
would succeed in large numbers because this was a world where
performance counted. It hasn't turned out that way.
</P>
<P>
   Women still have a tough time making it into management. We're
still socialized to look to men for leadership. Power is based not
on performance alone but on presence and personality _ and
perceptions of personality. In business, women still face a
different world from men.
</P>
<P>
   I recall the first board meeting of the Electronic Frontier
Foundation I ever attended, way back in 1990 or 1991. I had been
invited to join the board by Mitch Kapor, the entrepreneur and
developer of Lotus 1-2-3, and an enlightened person if ever there
was one. I knew the other board members, who all respected me. But
I couldn't get a word in edgewise. Why? I couldn't imagine any
reason other than that I spoke with a female voice. It was a shock.
</P>
<P>
   These were no traditional troglodytes in suits; they were my
kind of people, striving to build a new world on the Net. (At the
next meeting we had a female facilitator, and it went a lot
better.)
</P>
<P>
   It's a common experience for other women and girls, from
second-grade classrooms to boardrooms. And the high-tech industry
is really no better than most. I've been to meetings where a woman
ventures a comment and is ignored. Minutes later a man makes the
same point and is noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, as high-tech products are being integrated into
day-to-day business, people are using the Internet not just to
order products and retrieve information but also to communicate.
They use it to discuss issues, manage teams, negotiate contracts.
There's enough Net time for people _ women, that is _ to establish
themselves without a physical presence.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it's the users of the Internet, rather than the
sellers of the Internet, that are changing fastest. As a
communications medium where personal presence is primarily text and
sex differences are not immediately visible, the Internet is
tailor-made to help women finally find their voices.
</P>
<P>
   And if women feel (rightly or wrongly) stifled in corporate
environments, they can more easily strike out for themselves. The
information, access and productivity once available only to big
businesses are now accessible to individual entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, as the interim chairman of the Internet Corporation
for Assigned Names and Numbers (Icann), I have become part of a
world full of discussions over so-called mailing lists, where
people E-mail their ideas to large groups for comment. It's not a
gender-free or character-free world. But gender is less noticeable
in our interactions on line. What are noticeable are the words on
the screen: Does this person make sense?
</P>
<P>
   When I first started, the names meant nothing; now I have some
notion of what to expect from each: insight, whining, skepticism.
Yes, people have on-line personalities, but their sex does not
generally color how people read their thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   On these networks, women write in the same variety of ways as
men. But you can say your piece and post it without being
interrupted midway. The Net enforces a certain fairness by putting
everything up on the screen without fear or favor.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there are filtering tools, and there are certain people
many people filter out. But that usually has to do with content,
not gender.
</P>
<P>
   On line, I'm sure some people may filter me out, but it doesn't
happen the way it does off line _ unconsciously. Yes, people may
discount what women write, but they are more likely to read it. My
on-line voice does not have a high pitch of the kind that many men
find hard, for whatever reason, to hear.
</P>
<P>
   Another common experience of women _ having your good idea
picked up later and attributed to someone else _ is less likely to
happen on the Web. There's a record, and there are subtle ways of
pointing back to it if you are missed.
</P>
<P>
   Net-based discussion is likely to become increasingly important
in the way teams of people communicate, in politics, business or
other endeavors. It is important for women to join this on-line
world. But leadership goes beyond discussion to carrying things
forward.
</P>
<P>
   It requires making decisions that can't be made by consensus;
it's about absorbing the uncertainty everyone feels by making a
decision and taking responsibility for it.
</P>
<P>
   That's still not something most women are trained to do. But I'm
hopeful that on-line experience will help. The Net won't change
everything, but it's one more tool to overcome the destiny of
biology. The explicit rule is that we're equal, and new habits may
make it so. The ability to earn money at work has made a huge
difference in the balance of power at home.
</P>
<P>
   May the ability to be heard at work now make a huge difference
in the balance of power out in the world.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Net-based discussion is likely to become increasingly important
in the way teams of people communicate, in politics, business or
other endeavors. It is important for women to join this on-line
world. But leadership goes beyond discussion to carrying things
forward.
</P>
<P>
   It requires making decisions that can't be made by consensus;
it's about absorbing the uncertainty everyone feels by making a
decision and taking responsibility for it.
</P>
<P>
   That's still not something most women are trained to do. But I'm
hopeful that on-line experience will help. The Net won't change
everything, but it's one more tool to overcome the destiny of
biology. The explicit rule is that we're equal, and new habits may
make it so. The ability to earn money at work has made a huge
difference in the balance of power at home.
</P>
<P>
   May the ability to be heard at work now make a huge difference
in the balance of power out in the world.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Not long ago, Ann Winblad, a successful venture capitalist well
known on the high-tech circuit, stood up to speak at a conference.
She tapped the microphone and inquired sweetly, ``Does this pick up
women's voices?''
</P>
<P>
   If Winblad, with a sterling track record and millions yet to
invest, can ask that, consider what it's like for most women.
</P>
<P>
   We now get the mike at conferences in part because organizers
are consciously trying to balance things, and in part because many
of us simply deserve it _ but over all, women still have trouble
being heard.
</P>
<P>
   Can cyberspace change that? Or will it, like so many other tools
and technologies, simply become a way for the old order to
reinforce itself?
</P>
<P>
   Powerful tools in powerful hands tend to increase the
concentration of power, but the Internet isn't just a tool. It's a
medium that may change the balance of power.
</P>
<P>
   Consider some history. Long ago, women's work was defined by
women's bodies. They bore children and were generally weaker.
Gradually, as work became less physical and personal service became
a commodity rather than something one did at home, women joined the
work force as nurses, servants and governesses.
</P>
<P>
   As the world industrialized and dexterity began to matter more
than strength, they became machine operators. In many semiconductor
plants, especially overseas in countries where discrimination is
legal, women are still preferred today for their smaller fingers
and the precision with which they can work. And as work began to
include information, many women became telephone operators,
typists, clerks and secretaries.
</P>
<P>
   Then economic pressures started changing society and social
changes began affecting work patterns. As our economy has grown and
become ever more competitive, the stock market and other pressures
are focusing on performance rather than status, and capable women
have begun to get the work they deserve.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, people are promoted more for performance;
businesses can't afford to do otherwise in a competitive market.
Women can get good jobs based on performance _ at least up to the
highest reaches of many companies.
</P>
<P>
   I wish that were reliably true. Twenty years ago, we thought
that the high-tech world would by now be different, that women
would succeed in large numbers because this was a world where
performance counted. It hasn't turned out that way.
</P>
<P>
   Women still have a tough time making it into management. We're
still socialized to look to men for leadership. Power is based not
on performance alone but on presence and personality _ and
perceptions of personality. In business, women still face a
different world from men.
</P>
<P>
   I recall the first board meeting of the Electronic Frontier
Foundation I ever attended, way back in 1990 or 1991. I had been
invited to join the board by Mitch Kapor, the entrepreneur and
developer of Lotus 1-2-3, and an enlightened person if ever there
was one. I knew the other board members, who all respected me. But
I couldn't get a word in edgewise. Why? I couldn't imagine any
reason other than that I spoke with a female voice. It was a shock.
</P>
<P>
   These were no traditional troglodytes in suits; they were my
kind of people, striving to build a new world on the Net. (At the
next meeting we had a female facilitator, and it went a lot
better.)
</P>
<P>
   It's a common experience for other women and girls, from
second-grade classrooms to boardrooms. And the high-tech industry
is really no better than most. I've been to meetings where a woman
ventures a comment and is ignored. Minutes later a man makes the
same point and is noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, as high-tech products are being integrated into
day-to-day business, people are using the Internet not just to
order products and retrieve information but also to communicate.
They use it to discuss issues, manage teams, negotiate contracts.
There's enough Net time for people _ women, that is _ to establish
themselves without a physical presence.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it's the users of the Internet, rather than the
sellers of the Internet, that are changing fastest. As a
communications medium where personal presence is primarily text and
sex differences are not immediately visible, the Internet is
tailor-made to help women finally find their voices.
</P>
<P>
   And if women feel (rightly or wrongly) stifled in corporate
environments, they can more easily strike out for themselves. The
information, access and productivity once available only to big
businesses are now accessible to individual entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, as the interim chairman of the Internet Corporation
for Assigned Names and Numbers (Icann), I have become part of a
world full of discussions over so-called mailing lists, where
people E-mail their ideas to large groups for comment. It's not a
gender-free or character-free world. But gender is less noticeable
in our interactions on line. What are noticeable are the words on
the screen: Does this person make sense?
</P>
<P>
   When I first started, the names meant nothing; now I have some
notion of what to expect from each: insight, whining, skepticism.
Yes, people have on-line personalities, but their sex does not
generally color how people read their thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   On these networks, women write in the same variety of ways as
men. But you can say your piece and post it without being
interrupted midway. The Net enforces a certain fairness by putting
everything up on the screen without fear or favor.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there are filtering tools, and there are certain people
many people filter out. But that usually has to do with content,
not gender.
</P>
<P>
   On line, I'm sure some people may filter me out, but it doesn't
happen the way it does off line _ unconsciously. Yes, people may
discount what women write, but they are more likely to read it. My
on-line voice does not have a high pitch of the kind that many men
find hard, for whatever reason, to hear.
</P>
<P>
   Another common experience of women _ having your good idea
picked up later and attributed to someone else _ is less likely to
happen on the Web. There's a record, and there are subtle ways of
pointing back to it if you are missed.
</P>
<P>
   Net-based discussion is likely to become increasingly important
in the way teams of people communicate, in politics, business or
other endeavors. It is important for women to join this on-line
world. But leadership goes beyond discussion to carrying things
forward.
</P>
<P>
   It requires making decisions that can't be made by consensus;
it's about absorbing the uncertainty everyone feels by making a
decision and taking responsibility for it.
</P>
<P>
   That's still not something most women are trained to do. But I'm
hopeful that on-line experience will help. The Net won't change
everything, but it's one more tool to overcome the destiny of
biology. The explicit rule is that we're equal, and new habits may
make it so. The ability to earn money at work has made a huge
difference in the balance of power at home.

   May the ability to be heard at work now make a huge difference

<TEXT>
<P>
   At sunset one evening in 1353, the 6-year-old Catherine
Benincasa is said to have experienced the first of the mystical
visions that would power her brief, extraordinary life.
</P>
<P>
   While returning to her home in Siena with her brother Stefano
after a visit to their married sister across the valley, she gazed
over the church of St. Dominic and saw Jesus drenched in light,
flanked by SS. Peter, Paul and John.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus smiled at Catherine and blessed her. Stefano, finding his
sister standing in the road gaping at the sky, shook her from her
trance. The vision evaporated, and Catherine burst into tears.
</P>
<P>
   She returned that evening to what must have been a teeming
household; Catherine was the second youngest of 25 children, though
some of them, like her own twin sister, had died in infancy.
</P>
<P>
   While Catherine, later to become St. Catherine of Siena, kept
her vision of Christ a secret, her piety sharpened after that
encounter. In imitation of the public flagellants who had been
roaming Europe since the outbreak of bubonic plague some years
before, Catherine and several playmates took to flagellating
themselves in secret.
</P>
<P>
   An appetite for self-mortification would prove one of the
saint's most enduring traits, and would lead to her death, at 33,
of starvation.
</P>
<P>
   In this respect, Catherine's behavior foreshadowed that of a
great many women today for whom power and suffering _ often
self-inflicted _ are curiously intertwined. Modern-day anorexics,
bulimics and self-injurers experience an illusion of control
through disciplining or mutilating their bodies, echoing the pious
self-punishments of Catherine's time.
</P>
<P>
   The lives of Catherine and other saints like her can help to
explain why these impulses persist among women _ from athletes and
models to Diana, princess of Wales _ when both the world and the
position of women in it have been radically transformed.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine's childhood vision of Jesus and the penitence it
inspired were common in the lives of mystic saints: individuals
whose piety took the form of frequent, direct and personal visions
of Christ and other holy figures.
</P>
<P>
   Though mystics have existed since the earliest days of
Christianity, they gained prominence during the chaotic later
Middle Ages, a time of plague, civil strife and economic transition
that historians have compared to our present era.
</P>
<P>
   A great many of these visionaries were female _ St. Hildegard of
Bingen, St. Teresa of Avila, St. Catherine of Genoa, St. Bridget of
Sweden, to name just a few _ and their visions and prophecies
afforded them a degree of visibility and influence that was
virtually unheard of in women of their time.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteenth-century girls were married off as early as 12 or 13,
shortly after they reached puberty, in part to ensure their
virginity. But Catherine Benincasa had other plans _ she had
promised her chastity to Christ at the age of 7. The death of her
favorite older sister, in childbirth, sealed her resolve not to
marry, and she chopped off her long gold hair to repel potential
suitors.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents, distraught at having to forfeit the wealth a new
son-in-law might have brought to the family, retaliated by forcing
Catherine to work as the family servant. But when no amount of
punishment could break her will, her father relented, allowing her
to pursue her spiritual endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   At about 17, Catherine became a tertiary, or lay member, of a
Dominican order in Siena whose adherents she had watched and
admired as a child. These were chaste widows who ministered to the
sick and the urban poor (a growing presence as Europe's
agricultural economy yielded to commerce and city life).
</P>
<P>
   As a young virgin, Catherine made an incongruous addition. She
continued to live at home, spending most of her time praying alone
in a tiny cell beneath a flight of stairs, where she was plagued by
demonic visions and temptations.
</P>
<P>
   To combat these, she amplified her acts of penance, not speaking
for three years except at confession, eating nothing but bread,
water and raw vegetables, sleeping on a wooden board and
flagellating herself three times daily until she drew blood. Her
mother, aghast, took Catherine with her for a bathing cure; she
scalded herself in the sulfuric water.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time, the more you were like Jesus in his sufferings,
the holier you were and the better,'' says Sister Suzanne Noffke,
who is translating and editing Catherine's letters. ``She very much
wanted martyrdom.''
</P>
<P>
   Catherine's desire for martyrdom drew on popular tales of the
martyr-saints, some of whom died spectacularly at the hands of the
Romans during the first three centuries of Christianity, while
others were killed later by invading Huns, Vikings and Saracens.
</P>
<P>
   Yet martyrdom was only one route to sainthood for women, who
account for fewer than 20 percent of all saints. Many early female
saints were foundresses and patrons of churches and also
converters, both in the first centuries A.D. (St. Helena, Emperor
Constantine I's mother, is believed to have converted him) and
during the sixth to eighth centuries, when missionaries worked to
spread Christianity among the Frankish and Germanic tribes of
Northern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Queens and noblewomen, whose job it was to receive these
missionaries, often were first to convert, and then converted their
husbands _ which, in early societies, meant the simultaneous
conversion of that ruler's subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine found succor in her solitary torments on Shrove
Tuesday 1367, when she was about 20. It was the last night of
Carnival in Siena, and revelers filled the streets. As Catherine
prayed alone in her cell, the Virgin Mary and Jesus appeared to her
along with King David, John the Evangelist and SS. Paul and
Dominic. While King David played a harp, Jesus placed a ring of
betrothal upon Catherine's finger. It is said that the ring
remained visible to her throughout her life, though no one else
could see it.
</P>
<P>
   After this spiritual union _ a recurrent element in the lives of
female mystics _ Catherine's retreat from the world came to an
abrupt end: God instructed her to venture forth and help her fellow
creatures. She rejoined her family at dinnertime (though she seldom
ate) and reluctantly began to talk about her visions.
</P>
<P>
   She accompanied the other women in her order, known as
mantellate, on their visits to the hospital, where she was said to
have effected miracle cures. By the time she was in her early 20s,
she had amassed a group of disciples who called her Mamma. Male and
female, religious and lay (one of her closest friends was a young
nobleman she had extricated from a blood feud), these devotees
watched over Catherine during her ecstasies, when she went rigid
for hours at a time, and also served as her secretaries and
scribes. (Though she had learned to read, like most laypeople she
probably could not write.)
</P>
<P>
   She began an enormous correspondence, often dictating letters to
several scribes at once, imparting her wishes and advice to
neighbors, family members, kings, religious leaders and the pope
himself.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Siena was plagued by bloody internecine disputes,
and Catherine became known for her ability to mediate these
successfully, as well as to touch and convert sinners and
prisoners. She rekindled the faith of one man, Niccolo di Toldo, on
the eve of his own beheading, then accompanied him to his execution
and caught his severed head in her hands.
</P>
<P>
   She began visiting other Tuscan cities, often to dissuade them
from rebelling against the papacy, something they were increasingly
tempted to do as their own populations and commercial power grew.
There she would preach in public squares, urging the conversion of
sinners, and several priests were required to hear the thousands of
confessions her words provoked.
</P>
<P>
   For a 14th-century woman, such a public life was extraordinary
to the point of being freakish. By then, even aristocratic women
had lost much of the power they wielded in the early Middle Ages.
The population had grown, land was more scarce and heredity laws
were rewritten in favor of primogeniture so that family estates
could be kept intact. Women could rarely inherit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good woman was invisible,'' says Elizabeth Petroff, a
professor of comparative literature at the University of
Massachusetts. ``She wasn't supposed to leave the house. She wasn't
even supposed to be seen standing at the window of the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the convent, women received little or no education, and
with the rise of the all-male university in the 13th century,
education within the convents began to suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Medieval theology portrayed women as the more fleshly of the
sexes, corrupt and dangerous to men; accounts of many male saints'
lives abound with lewd female temptresses.
</P>
<P>
   It was no surprise, then, that pious women of Catherine's era
turned to mysticism; contemplation was virtually forced upon them
by the lack of other opportunities. But that their visions and
prophecies were taken seriously by men points to a paradox in the
medieval view of women: Their very lowliness, it was thought, made
them more likely conduits for celestial intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Newman, professor of English and religion at
Northwestern University, says: ``Women's bodies were seen as being
more permeable than men's, more open to diverse influences. Just as
women are more easily tempted by the Devil, the same thing is true
with the Holy Spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, Newman says, it was impossible for male clerics
to dismiss out of hand the holy visions of a woman. ``Women
embodied that voice from the underground,'' she says, ``of Christ
standing in judgment over the power structure.''
</P>
<P>
   In the medieval mind, there was a connection between weakness,
self-abnegation and holiness _ a connection that originated in
Christ's shame and suffering on earth. Female mystics believed this
too.
</P>
<P>
   St. Hildegard of Bingen, a 12th-century visionary and
Benedictine nun who penned strenuous works of theology, medicine
and natural history as well as hymns and other liturgical music,
wrote of herself, ``I am a poor earthen vessel and say these things
not of myself, but from the serene Light.''
</P>
<P>
   Catherine's correspondence is sprinkled with professions of her
own unworthiness. ``Poor wretched woman that I am, my sins are so
much more numerous than ever,'' she wrote in one letter, and in
another, to an apostolic nuncio for Pope Gregory XI, ``I received
your letter, my dear father, and it was a great consolation and joy
to think you would remember someone so poor and lowly.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet these disclaimers hardly offset the emphatic, even imperious
tone of the letters themselves, in which Catherine used her status
as an empty vessel for God's word to chide, exhort, cajole and even
threaten with damnation people she believed were failing to embody
their full Christian potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``If women had a reputation for genuine holiness, that was a
ticket to influence,'' Sister Noffke says, and Catherine did not
hesitate to use it. In a letter to a governor of Milan who
violently opposed the papacy, she likened him to a gangrenous limb
on a body of the church.
</P>
<P>
   To King Charles V of France, whose involvement in the Hundred
Years War Catherine felt was sapping resources from the more worthy
project of initiating another crusade, she wrote: ``Enough of this
stupid blindness! I am telling you in the name of Christ crucified
to wait no longer to make this peace. Make peace! Make peace!'' At
times she even mocked her own zeal. ``I don't want to say any
more,'' she wrote to her old friend Frate Bartolomeo Dominici,
``because I wouldn't stop until I died _ or bored you to death!''
</P>
<P>
   Catherine's most ardent wish for the church was that the papacy
would return to Rome from Avignon, where it had relocated in 1309
to escape civil unrest. To this end, she wrote hortatory letters to
Pope Gregory XI, with whom she felt a great familiarity, addressing
him often as Babbo, or ``Dearest Daddy,'' and urging him to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up, father! No more irresponsibility!'' she wrote in one
letter, and in another: ``You ought to be using the power and
strength that is yours. If you don't intend to use it, it would be
better and more to God's honor and the good of your soul to
resign.''
</P>
<P>
   In this and nearly all of her letters, she concludes by
apologizing for her forwardness. ``Forgive me! Forgive me! My great
love for your salvation, and my great pain when I see it
threatened, makes me speak ... Don't make it necessary for me to
complain about you to Christ crucified. (There is no one else I can
complain to, since there is no one greater (than you) on earth).''
</P>
<P>
   Mingled with this odd swirl of diffidence and cheekiness, of
grandiosity and self-effacement, was the tendency among female
mystics to take physical self-punishment to brutal extremes.
Catherine overcame her revulsion at a cancer patient's fetid sore
by drinking a cup of the pus it discharged, and she was famous for
her drastic fasting _ she often inserted sticks into her throat to
make herself vomit after eating.
</P>
<P>
   Bridget of Sweden poured hot wax on her flesh. St. Clare of
Assisi slept on the floor in wintertime and fasted three days each
week during Lent. ``The men had work to do, so they didn't have
time for a lot of penance and suffering,'' Noffke says. ``Women
were not to be seen, not to be heard, but they could suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   Priests tended to glorify suffering in women, and encouraged it
in their confessions. Yet extreme self-mortification could also
make a woman the object of suspicion, for around the corner from
inspired female holiness always lurked the possibility of heresy or
witchcraft _ the danger that Satan, not God, was employing the
woman as his vessel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised at your fear, father, especially about my
eating habits,'' Catherine wrote to a priest in Florence. ``I am
always fearful because of my own weakness and the devil's
cleverness.''
</P>
<P>
   The historian Caroline Walker Bynum has noted that witch and
saint were in a sense mirror images of each other: Both were
impelled by an outside power, whether good or evil; both could read
people's minds and perform supernatural feats; both were lifted off
the ground _ witches by flying, saints through levitation.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicions about Catherine's orthodoxy prompted the leaders of
the Dominican order to summon her to Florence in spring 1374, when
her reputation first began to grow. Though she satisfied her
examiners, the Dominicans assigned her a new confessor, Raymond of
Capua, whom they charged with keeping a sharp eye on her.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Raymond became Catherine's most loyal
defender, and wrote her vita, or biography, which made a strong
case for her sainthood. (She was canonized in 1461 and declared a
Doctor of the Church _ one of three women to bear that title _ in
1970.)
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most female mystics who became saints had the allegiance
of one or more powerful men who shielded them from the world's
suspicion. ``If you didn't have somebody in the church hierarchy
who could speak for you, you were really lost,'' Elizabeth Petroff
says.
</P>
<P>
   One casualty was Marguerite Porete, author of ``A Mirror of
Simple Souls,'' who was accused of heresy and burned in 1310.
According to Barbara Newman, the problem for Margaret may have been
one of style as much as doctrine: ``She did not say, `I have had a
vision' or `I have had a prophetic call.' She just wrote the book
the way a male author would have written it, and she didn't get
away with it.'' Female strength, untempered by humility,
self-abnegation or the imprimatur of a male authority, was an
intolerable threat.
</P>
<P>
   In 1376, Catherine intensified her campaign to move the papacy
from Avignon to Rome by visiting Avignon herself, where she met
repeatedly with Gregory XI and continued to write him as well,
urging his departure.
</P>
<P>
   In September of that year, he finally set off for Rome by ship,
his reluctant court in tow. But the pope's return to Rome failed to
have the salubrious impact Catherine had hoped for. Disheartened in
a foreign land, Gregory XI died in 1378, and his Neapolitan
successor, Urban VI, managed to alienate the French cardinals and
royalty almost instantly.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinals retaliated by appointing a second pope, or
antipope, from Geneva, whom they installed in Avignon as Clement
VII. Thus began the Great Western Schism, in which two, and even
three, popes sought to preside over Western Christendom until 1417.
</P>
<P>
   At Urban VI's request, Catherine journeyed to Rome and worked
furiously to rally support behind him, believing that his
legitimate election was inviolable, whatever his personal faults.
She was brokenhearted over the failure of her mission, and her
years of austerities had ravaged her physically, leaving her in
constant pain.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to eat or even drink water, she deteriorated rapidly.
``Here is my body which I acknowledge as coming from Thee and I now
offer it to Thee; may it be an anvil for Thy beatings, to atone for
their sins,'' she prayed. She died in 1380.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``Holy Anorexia,'' Rudolph M. Bell argues
compellingly that Catherine of Siena, along with many other Italian
female mystics, fits the classic profile of an anorexic. In a
14th-century context, anorexia actually makes a kind of sense.
Self-deprivation was widely agreed to be holy, and holiness was one
of the few modes of self-expression available to women _ virtually
their only route to power.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise, then, is not that anorexics existed in St.
Catherine's time, but that in our present secular, affluent
culture, where women have access to a degree of education,
independence and self-expression that would have staggered a
14th-century woman, self-denial and suffering continue to hold out
the same kind of promise.
</P>
<P>
   Today, anorexia nervosa afflicts about 1 of every 100 female
adolescents in America, a majority of whom may never recover fully,
and between 10 percent and 20 percent of whom will eventually die
from the disease. About 2 million people, mostly women, cut and
burn themselves compulsively in pursuit of an illusory sense of
control, and many millions suffer from bulimia.
</P>
<P>
   In high-pressure athletic disciplines such as ballet,
gymnastics, figure skating, diving and long-distance running, the
incidence of eating disorders among women is much higher. Rudolph
Bell cites a study showing that nearly 1 in 6 aspiring ballerinas
was anorexic. Clearly, a substantial number of women still derive a
sense of power from disciplining their bodies, despite the fact
that their deprivations and self-inflicted wounds ultimately weaken
them and sometimes cost them their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Most remarkably, sufferers of anorexia and self-injury tend to
be white, Western and middle to upper class _ precisely the women
who, more than any before them in history, would seem able to
control a great deal more than their physical selves.
</P>
<P>
   Even as our culture decries these disorders, in subtle ways it
endorses the equation of suffering with female power. In recent
fashion photography what was heroin chic if not a study of the
stark beauty of feminine duress, a beauty that seemed to pulse
forth with even greater intensity from the scrawny, bruised-looking
models with raccoon eyes and hair tangled to perfection.
</P>
<P>
   And how else can we interpret the popular rehabilitation of
Hillary Clinton, now that her outright power _ offensive to many
Americans _ has been tempered by her dignified and mostly silent
endurance of the most public marital humiliation ever. Now, for the
first time since her arrival at the White House six years ago, the
first lady is widely hailed not only as a model for women, but _
most dizzyingly _ also as a future senatorial and even presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   It is as if, through suffering, a certain unseemliness
associated with her authority has been erased. Pain has worked for
Hillary Clinton, involuntary though it may have been _ a lesson
that doubtless will be absorbed by younger women who look up to
her.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best example of a woman whose visible pain inspired
passionate devotion was Diana, princess of Wales, who can
legitimately be called a popular saint. In the princess, as in the
late-medieval mystics, personal charisma and a desire to help
others was tinctured with suffering, including some of the same
self-inflicted torments _ anorexia, bulimia, self-mutilation _ that
the mystic saints underwent.
</P>
<P>
   But Catherine of Siena punished herself in imitation of Christ,
and the power she experienced came from feeling a greater proximity
to God. Lacking any such divine affiliation, the suffering our
culture elicits from its women seems doubly tragic _ pointless in
itself and, in most cases, a distraction from the real sources of
power they might otherwise be able to tap.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of her life, Catherine of Siena tried to reverse
her extreme fasting, but by then her body could no longer tolerate
food. Though she urged other women not to follow her example, her
suffering was glorified after her death, and scores of young
Italian girls starved themselves in her image.
</P>
<P>
   In this, as in all matters, Catherine employed her most trusted
weapon: epistolary advice. ``And where is the hope that you used to
have in the kingdom of God?'' she wrote to a Dominican nun who had
grown ill from too many austerities. ``It is gone with the
attachment to penance, by which means it hoped to have life
eternal. ... Don't wish for the lesser good of penance to hinder
the greater good.''
</P>
<P>
   Fewer women nowadays may long for a union with Christ, as
Catherine did, but her advice still resonates: Pain, as an end in
itself, may well distract us from our greater good.

<TEXT>
<P>
   At sunset one evening in 1353, the 6-year-old Catherine
Benincasa is said to have experienced the first of the mystical
visions that would power her brief, extraordinary life.
</P>
<P>
   While returning to her home in Siena with her brother Stefano
after a visit to their married sister across the valley, she gazed
over the church of St. Dominic and saw Jesus drenched in light,
flanked by SS. Peter, Paul and John.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus smiled at Catherine and blessed her. Stefano, finding his
sister standing in the road gaping at the sky, shook her from her
trance. The vision evaporated, and Catherine burst into tears.
</P>
<P>
   She returned that evening to what must have been a teeming
household; Catherine was the second youngest of 25 children, though
some of them, like her own twin sister, had died in infancy.
</P>
<P>
   While Catherine, later to become St. Catherine of Siena, kept
her vision of Christ a secret, her piety sharpened after that
encounter. In imitation of the public flagellants who had been
roaming Europe since the outbreak of bubonic plague some years
before, Catherine and several playmates took to flagellating
themselves in secret.
</P>
<P>
   An appetite for self-mortification would prove one of the
saint's most enduring traits, and would lead to her death, at 33,
of starvation.
</P>
<P>
   In this respect, Catherine's behavior foreshadowed that of a
great many women today for whom power and suffering _ often
self-inflicted _ are curiously intertwined. Modern-day anorexics,
bulimics and self-injurers experience an illusion of control
through disciplining or mutilating their bodies, echoing the pious
self-punishments of Catherine's time.
</P>
<P>
   The lives of Catherine and other saints like her can help to
explain why these impulses persist among women _ from athletes and
models to Diana, princess of Wales _ when both the world and the
position of women in it have been radically transformed.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine's childhood vision of Jesus and the penitence it
inspired were common in the lives of mystic saints: individuals
whose piety took the form of frequent, direct and personal visions
of Christ and other holy figures.
</P>
<P>
   Though mystics have existed since the earliest days of
Christianity, they gained prominence during the chaotic later
Middle Ages, a time of plague, civil strife and economic transition
that historians have compared to our present era.
</P>
<P>
   A great many of these visionaries were female _ St. Hildegard of
Bingen, St. Teresa of Avila, St. Catherine of Genoa, St. Bridget of
Sweden, to name just a few _ and their visions and prophecies
afforded them a degree of visibility and influence that was
virtually unheard of in women of their time.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteenth-century girls were married off as early as 12 or 13,
shortly after they reached puberty, in part to ensure their
virginity. But Catherine Benincasa had other plans _ she had
promised her chastity to Christ at the age of 7. The death of her
favorite older sister, in childbirth, sealed her resolve not to
marry, and she chopped off her long gold hair to repel potential
suitors.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents, distraught at having to forfeit the wealth a new
son-in-law might have brought to the family, retaliated by forcing
Catherine to work as the family servant. But when no amount of
punishment could break her will, her father relented, allowing her
to pursue her spiritual endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   At about 17, Catherine became a tertiary, or lay member, of a
Dominican order in Siena whose adherents she had watched and
admired as a child. These were chaste widows who ministered to the
sick and the urban poor (a growing presence as Europe's
agricultural economy yielded to commerce and city life).
</P>
<P>
   As a young virgin, Catherine made an incongruous addition. She
continued to live at home, spending most of her time praying alone
in a tiny cell beneath a flight of stairs, where she was plagued by
demonic visions and temptations.
</P>
<P>
   To combat these, she amplified her acts of penance, not speaking
for three years except at confession, eating nothing but bread,
water and raw vegetables, sleeping on a wooden board and
flagellating herself three times daily until she drew blood. Her
mother, aghast, took Catherine with her for a bathing cure; she
scalded herself in the sulfuric water.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time, the more you were like Jesus in his sufferings,
the holier you were and the better,'' says Sister Suzanne Noffke,
who is translating and editing Catherine's letters. ``She very much
wanted martyrdom.''
</P>
<P>
   Catherine's desire for martyrdom drew on popular tales of the
martyr-saints, some of whom died spectacularly at the hands of the
Romans during the first three centuries of Christianity, while
others were killed later by invading Huns, Vikings and Saracens.
</P>
<P>
   Yet martyrdom was only one route to sainthood for women, who
account for fewer than 20 percent of all saints. Many early female
saints were foundresses and patrons of churches and also
converters, both in the first centuries A.D. (St. Helena, Emperor
Constantine I's mother, is believed to have converted him) and
during the sixth to eighth centuries, when missionaries worked to
spread Christianity among the Frankish and Germanic tribes of
Northern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Queens and noblewomen, whose job it was to receive these
missionaries, often were first to convert, and then converted their
husbands _ which, in early societies, meant the simultaneous
conversion of that ruler's subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine found succor in her solitary torments on Shrove
Tuesday 1367, when she was about 20. It was the last night of
Carnival in Siena, and revelers filled the streets. As Catherine
prayed alone in her cell, the Virgin Mary and Jesus appeared to her
along with King David, John the Evangelist and SS. Paul and
Dominic. While King David played a harp, Jesus placed a ring of
betrothal upon Catherine's finger. It is said that the ring
remained visible to her throughout her life, though no one else
could see it.
</P>
<P>
   After this spiritual union _ a recurrent element in the lives of
female mystics _ Catherine's retreat from the world came to an
abrupt end: God instructed her to venture forth and help her fellow
creatures. She rejoined her family at dinnertime (though she seldom
ate) and reluctantly began to talk about her visions.
</P>
<P>
   She accompanied the other women in her order, known as
mantellate, on their visits to the hospital, where she was said to
have effected miracle cures. By the time she was in her early 20s,
she had amassed a group of disciples who called her Mamma. Male and
female, religious and lay (one of her closest friends was a young
nobleman she had extricated from a blood feud), these devotees
watched over Catherine during her ecstasies, when she went rigid
for hours at a time, and also served as her secretaries and
scribes. (Though she had learned to read, like most laypeople she
probably could not write.)
</P>
<P>
   She began an enormous correspondence, often dictating letters to
several scribes at once, imparting her wishes and advice to
neighbors, family members, kings, religious leaders and the pope
himself.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Siena was plagued by bloody internecine disputes,
and Catherine became known for her ability to mediate these
successfully, as well as to touch and convert sinners and
prisoners. She rekindled the faith of one man, Niccolo di Toldo, on
the eve of his own beheading, then accompanied him to his execution
and caught his severed head in her hands.
</P>
<P>
   She began visiting other Tuscan cities, often to dissuade them
from rebelling against the papacy, something they were increasingly
tempted to do as their own populations and commercial power grew.
There she would preach in public squares, urging the conversion of
sinners, and several priests were required to hear the thousands of
confessions her words provoked.
</P>
<P>
   For a 14th-century woman, such a public life was extraordinary
to the point of being freakish. By then, even aristocratic women
had lost much of the power they wielded in the early Middle Ages.
The population had grown, land was more scarce and heredity laws
were rewritten in favor of primogeniture so that family estates
could be kept intact. Women could rarely inherit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good woman was invisible,'' says Elizabeth Petroff, a
professor of comparative literature at the University of
Massachusetts. ``She wasn't supposed to leave the house. She wasn't
even supposed to be seen standing at the window of the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the convent, women received little or no education, and
with the rise of the all-male university in the 13th century,
education within the convents began to suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Medieval theology portrayed women as the more fleshly of the
sexes, corrupt and dangerous to men; accounts of many male saints'
lives abound with lewd female temptresses.
</P>
<P>
   It was no surprise, then, that pious women of Catherine's era
turned to mysticism; contemplation was virtually forced upon them
by the lack of other opportunities. But that their visions and
prophecies were taken seriously by men points to a paradox in the
medieval view of women: Their very lowliness, it was thought, made
them more likely conduits for celestial intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Newman, professor of English and religion at
Northwestern University, says: ``Women's bodies were seen as being
more permeable than men's, more open to diverse influences. Just as
women are more easily tempted by the Devil, the same thing is true
with the Holy Spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, Newman says, it was impossible for male clerics
to dismiss out of hand the holy visions of a woman. ``Women
embodied that voice from the underground,'' she says, ``of Christ
standing in judgment over the power structure.''
</P>
<P>
   In the medieval mind, there was a connection between weakness,
self-abnegation and holiness _ a connection that originated in
Christ's shame and suffering on earth. Female mystics believed this
too.
</P>
<P>
   St. Hildegard of Bingen, a 12th-century visionary and
Benedictine nun who penned strenuous works of theology, medicine
and natural history as well as hymns and other liturgical music,
wrote of herself, ``I am a poor earthen vessel and say these things
not of myself, but from the serene Light.''
</P>
<P>
   Catherine's correspondence is sprinkled with professions of her
own unworthiness. ``Poor wretched woman that I am, my sins are so
much more numerous than ever,'' she wrote in one letter, and in
another, to an apostolic nuncio for Pope Gregory XI, ``I received
your letter, my dear father, and it was a great consolation and joy
to think you would remember someone so poor and lowly.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet these disclaimers hardly offset the emphatic, even imperious
tone of the letters themselves, in which Catherine used her status
as an empty vessel for God's word to chide, exhort, cajole and even
threaten with damnation people she believed were failing to embody
their full Christian potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``If women had a reputation for genuine holiness, that was a
ticket to influence,'' Sister Noffke says, and Catherine did not
hesitate to use it. In a letter to a governor of Milan who
violently opposed the papacy, she likened him to a gangrenous limb
on a body of the church.
</P>
<P>
   To King Charles V of France, whose involvement in the Hundred
Years War Catherine felt was sapping resources from the more worthy
project of initiating another crusade, she wrote: ``Enough of this
stupid blindness! I am telling you in the name of Christ crucified
to wait no longer to make this peace. Make peace! Make peace!'' At
times she even mocked her own zeal. ``I don't want to say any
more,'' she wrote to her old friend Frate Bartolomeo Dominici,
``because I wouldn't stop until I died _ or bored you to death!''
</P>
<P>
   Catherine's most ardent wish for the church was that the papacy
would return to Rome from Avignon, where it had relocated in 1309
to escape civil unrest. To this end, she wrote hortatory letters to
Pope Gregory XI, with whom she felt a great familiarity, addressing
him often as Babbo, or ``Dearest Daddy,'' and urging him to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up, father! No more irresponsibility!'' she wrote in one
letter, and in another: ``You ought to be using the power and
strength that is yours. If you don't intend to use it, it would be
better and more to God's honor and the good of your soul to
resign.''
</P>
<P>
   In this and nearly all of her letters, she concludes by
apologizing for her forwardness. ``Forgive me! Forgive me! My great
love for your salvation, and my great pain when I see it
threatened, makes me speak ... Don't make it necessary for me to
complain about you to Christ crucified. (There is no one else I can
complain to, since there is no one greater (than you) on earth).''
</P>
<P>
   Mingled with this odd swirl of diffidence and cheekiness, of
grandiosity and self-effacement, was the tendency among female
mystics to take physical self-punishment to brutal extremes.
Catherine overcame her revulsion at a cancer patient's fetid sore
by drinking a cup of the pus it discharged, and she was famous for
her drastic fasting _ she often inserted sticks into her throat to
make herself vomit after eating.
</P>
<P>
   Bridget of Sweden poured hot wax on her flesh. St. Clare of
Assisi slept on the floor in wintertime and fasted three days each
week during Lent. ``The men had work to do, so they didn't have
time for a lot of penance and suffering,'' Noffke says. ``Women
were not to be seen, not to be heard, but they could suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   Priests tended to glorify suffering in women, and encouraged it
in their confessions. Yet extreme self-mortification could also
make a woman the object of suspicion, for around the corner from
inspired female holiness always lurked the possibility of heresy or
witchcraft _ the danger that Satan, not God, was employing the
woman as his vessel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised at your fear, father, especially about my
eating habits,'' Catherine wrote to a priest in Florence. ``I am
always fearful because of my own weakness and the devil's
cleverness.''
</P>
<P>
   The historian Caroline Walker Bynum has noted that witch and
saint were in a sense mirror images of each other: Both were
impelled by an outside power, whether good or evil; both could read
people's minds and perform supernatural feats; both were lifted off
the ground _ witches by flying, saints through levitation.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicions about Catherine's orthodoxy prompted the leaders of
the Dominican order to summon her to Florence in spring 1374, when
her reputation first began to grow. Though she satisfied her
examiners, the Dominicans assigned her a new confessor, Raymond of
Capua, whom they charged with keeping a sharp eye on her.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Raymond became Catherine's most loyal
defender, and wrote her vita, or biography, which made a strong
case for her sainthood. (She was canonized in 1461 and declared a
Doctor of the Church _ one of three women to bear that title _ in
1970.)
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most female mystics who became saints had the allegiance
of one or more powerful men who shielded them from the world's
suspicion. ``If you didn't have somebody in the church hierarchy
who could speak for you, you were really lost,'' Elizabeth Petroff
says.
</P>
<P>
   One casualty was Marguerite Porete, author of ``A Mirror of
Simple Souls,'' who was accused of heresy and burned in 1310.
According to Barbara Newman, the problem for Margaret may have been
one of style as much as doctrine: ``She did not say, `I have had a
vision' or `I have had a prophetic call.' She just wrote the book
the way a male author would have written it, and she didn't get
away with it.'' Female strength, untempered by humility,
self-abnegation or the imprimatur of a male authority, was an
intolerable threat.
</P>
<P>
   In 1376, Catherine intensified her campaign to move the papacy
from Avignon to Rome by visiting Avignon herself, where she met
repeatedly with Gregory XI and continued to write him as well,
urging his departure.
</P>
<P>
   In September of that year, he finally set off for Rome by ship,
his reluctant court in tow. But the pope's return to Rome failed to
have the salubrious impact Catherine had hoped for. Disheartened in
a foreign land, Gregory XI died in 1378, and his Neapolitan
successor, Urban VI, managed to alienate the French cardinals and
royalty almost instantly.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinals retaliated by appointing a second pope, or
antipope, from Geneva, whom they installed in Avignon as Clement
VII. Thus began the Great Western Schism, in which two, and even
three, popes sought to preside over Western Christendom until 1417.
</P>
<P>
   At Urban VI's request, Catherine journeyed to Rome and worked
furiously to rally support behind him, believing that his
legitimate election was inviolable, whatever his personal faults.
She was brokenhearted over the failure of her mission, and her
years of austerities had ravaged her physically, leaving her in
constant pain.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to eat or even drink water, she deteriorated rapidly.
``Here is my body which I acknowledge as coming from Thee and I now
offer it to Thee; may it be an anvil for Thy beatings, to atone for
their sins,'' she prayed. She died in 1380.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``Holy Anorexia,'' Rudolph M. Bell argues
compellingly that Catherine of Siena, along with many other Italian
female mystics, fits the classic profile of an anorexic. In a
14th-century context, anorexia actually makes a kind of sense.
Self-deprivation was widely agreed to be holy, and holiness was one
of the few modes of self-expression available to women _ virtually
their only route to power.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise, then, is not that anorexics existed in St.
Catherine's time, but that in our present secular, affluent
culture, where women have access to a degree of education,
independence and self-expression that would have staggered a
14th-century woman, self-denial and suffering continue to hold out
the same kind of promise.
</P>
<P>
   Today, anorexia nervosa afflicts about 1 of every 100 female
adolescents in America, a majority of whom may never recover fully,
and between 10 percent and 20 percent of whom will eventually die
from the disease. About 2 million people, mostly women, cut and
burn themselves compulsively in pursuit of an illusory sense of

</P>
<P>
   In high-pressure athletic disciplines such as ballet,
gymnastics, figure skating, diving and long-distance running, the
incidence of eating disorders among women is much higher. Rudolph
Bell cites a study showing that nearly 1 in 6 aspiring ballerinas
was anorexic. Clearly, a substantial number of women still derive a
sense of power from disciplining their bodies, despite the fact
that their deprivations and self-inflicted wounds ultimately weaken
them and sometimes cost them their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Most remarkably, sufferers of anorexia and self-injury tend to
be white, Western and middle to upper class _ precisely the women
who, more than any before them in history, would seem able to
control a great deal more than their physical selves.
</P>

   Even as our culture decries these disorders, in subtle ways it
endorses the equation of suffering with female power. In recent
fashion photography what was heroin chic if not a study of the
stark beauty of feminine duress, a beauty that seemed to pulse
forth with even greater intensity from the scrawny, bruised-looking
models with raccoon eyes and hair tangled to perfection.
</P>
<P>
   And how else can we interpret the popular rehabilitation of
Hillary Clinton, now that her outright power _ offensive to many
Americans _ has been tempered by her dignified and mostly silent
endurance of the most public marital humiliation ever. Now, for the
first time since her arrival at the White House six years ago, the

<P>
   The history of women in art is such a great unruly subject that
any curator trying to pull together a representative exhibition
would probably start by having her head examined.
</P>
<P>
   Titian, to mention just one old master inspired to greatness by
the female, made at least 39 paintings of the Madonna and 19
Venuses.
</P>
<P>
   At that, choosing from among the many thousands of similar works
in the traditional Western canon might be easier than deciding
which pieces among today's outpouring of paintings, sculptures,
videos and installations are meant for the ages.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it would be derelict to let these thousand years go by
without acknowledging how deeply our cultural reflexes, and our
sexual politics, have been influenced by images of women: woman as
mother, as goddess, as muse or sex object and ultimately, woman as
master of her own place in the creation of art.
</P>
<P>
   And if the task is approached with humility, one can at least
show a few fragments of this overwhelming history.
</P>
<P>
   Art, to begin with, is about power, plain and simple; about who
owns the tools, who makes the rules, who gets to shape the image of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, in high art, men were the image shapers _ and not
coincidentally men were the ones with access to training, peer
support and patronage, as the art historian Linda Nochlin pointed
out in a landmark 1971 article, ``Why Have There Been No Great
Women Artists?''
</P>
<P>
   The exceptions always tended to prove the rule: certain medieval
nuns famed for their manuscript illustrations; a handful of
Renaissance painters, including Sofonisba Anguissola and Lavinia
Fontana. It was not until our own century, and particularly in the
last 30 years, that this pattern started to change significantly,
with women systematically claiming art and the life of the artist
as their own.
</P>
<P>
   In one famous 12th-century French carving of the Virgin and
Child, the anonymous sculptor paid scrupulous attention to human
details of his subject. Mother and child, with their drooping eyes
and pursed lips, share an endearing family resemblance. But the
import of this work is transcendental, not personal. Despite the
woman's dominant size, the weight of authority is with her son. In
the medieval Christian scheme of things, He embodies Divine Wisdom;
she is Wisdom's throne.
</P>
<P>
   Half a millennium later, around 1639, the Flemish artist Peter
Paul Rubens painted a secular version of the Holy Family, in which
he hovers somewhat anxiously over the figure of his wife, Helena
Fourment, and their infant son.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, it is the mother, an aura of light playing around
her head, who looks childlike. (Fourment was 16 and Rubens 53 when
they married.) With her guileless face and baby-fine hair, and
encased in silk and satin, she seems to be led haltingly forward by
her husband's paternal hand.
</P>
<P>
   But see how the atmosphere relaxes and comes alive when family
portraits are painted by women. In 18th-century France,
Elizabeth-Louise Vigee-LeBrun paints a portrait of herself and her
young daughter Julie. The two figures, dressed in the newly
unencumbering fashions of the day, look candidly outward as they
embrace like sisters. And in that affectionate, egalitarian hug,
old hierarchies of power seem to melt away.
</P>
<P>
   One senses the presence of a new kind of wisdom, confidently
rooted in the here and now, in Alice Neel's forthright 1978
portrait of a nude, pregnant woman. (Neel painted the theme over
and over because she felt it had been neglected in art.)
</P>
<P>
   There's a mirror in the picture, that ancient emblem of vanity
and self-examination, but it's behind the sitter, as if she isn't
aware or doesn't care that it is there. Her alert eyes stare
straight ahead. Her body, awkwardly perched on a stiff, little,
dust-ruffled chair, is literally filled with life but also
self-contained.
</P>
<P>
   Paintings in which women play the role of artistic muse are
similarly varied, particularly when this time-honored theme is
transformed in the hands of women.
</P>
<P>
   A canonical example of the type is Jan Vermeer's ``Allegory of
Painting'' (1667). It depicts an artist at work at his easel. His
female model, dressed as Clio, the muse of history _ from which, it
is implied, all art seeks inspiration _ stands passively before
him.
</P>
<P>
   But a version of the same motif done some decades earlier by the
Italian artist Artemisia Gentileschi had already radically revised
the convention. In her extraordinary ``Self-Portrait as the
Allegory of Painting'' (1630), Gentileschi depicts herself,
paintbrush raised, eyes focused intently on the canvas before her.
Her unkempt hair and the gold chain around her neck were standard
symbols for creative passion and the rewards of artistic
accomplishment, but in this case, artist, model and muse are one
and the same person.
</P>
<P>
   The multifaceted image of woman as muse comes up-to-date in
painted quilts from the 1990s by the African-American artist Faith
Ringgold. By using the quilt as a medium, Ringgold touches on the
vast, rich tradition of art by women in media usually referred to
as crafts. And her works shrewdly rewrite the story of women's role
in modern painting. In one, the fabulous Josephine Baker makes
herself at home as an erotic odalisque in Matisse's studio.
</P>
<P>
   The history of the image of women as erotic objects in art is
endless and, for modern eyes sharpened by the critical insights of
feminist thought, endlessly problematic. One can only hint at how
many ways it has been reshaped in women's hands.
</P>
<P>
   A nude Venus in the style of Botticelli and another by Titian
are embodiments of Neoplatonic ideals. But in both cases women are
also sensuous, passive ornaments intended primarily for the male
gaze.
</P>
<P>
   This is particularly so in the case of Titian; one painting not
only provides a surrogate audience in the figure of an ogling
musician but also models its Venus on a courtesan type familiar in
16th-century Venice.
</P>
<P>
   Beside these two canvases one might instructively place more
recent paintings. Suzanne Valadon's ``La Chambre Bleu'' (''The Blue
Room,'' 1923) is one, with its clothed model who smokes cigarettes,
reads books and doesn't make her bed.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is a recent self-portrait in male attire by the
young California artist Catherine Opie, a witty study in the
fluidity of gender, and a striking icon of same-sex desire,
offering a perspective that gives those Venuses a whole new lease
on erotic life.
</P>
<P>
   All of the work mentioned so far is Western in origin, and
mostly from the past. But new art is global in scope, and much of
its expansionist impulse is a direct result of concerns with
self-identity _ visual and psychological _ generated by the
feminist movement.
</P>
<P>
   You can see this at work in revisionist examples of that most
venerable of female images, the goddess. The young Japanese-born
artist Mariko Mori has based a recent series on a pan-Asian image
of a female Buddhist deity associated with nature. Using elaborate
multimedia technology she has transformed herself into a goddess
floating in the cool nirvana of cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican-American artist Yolanda Lopez, meanwhile, has
adopted the icon of the Virgin of Guadalupe, that potent New World
symbol of political affirmation and resistance, for her own
self-portrait, with results that depart radically from the serenity
of the original.
</P>
<P>
   In this painting, wearing running shoes and carrying a serpent,
Lopez bursts forth from the Virgin's traditional flaming mandorla,
throws off her star-spangled cloak and dashes straight toward us,
beaming, into the future. The merging of past into future is what
this painting is all about.
</P>
<P>
   There are countless more transformative visions where this comes
from _ the freed imaginations of women.

<P>
   The history of women in art is such a great unruly subject that
any curator trying to pull together a representative exhibition
would probably start by having her head examined.
</P>
<P>
   Titian, to mention just one old master inspired to greatness by
the female, made at least 39 paintings of the Madonna and 19
Venuses.
</P>
<P>
   At that, choosing from among the many thousands of similar works
in the traditional Western canon might be easier than deciding
which pieces among today's outpouring of paintings, sculptures,
videos and installations are meant for the ages.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it would be derelict to let these thousand years go by
without acknowledging how deeply our cultural reflexes, and our
sexual politics, have been influenced by images of women: woman as
mother, as goddess, as muse or sex object and ultimately, woman as
master of her own place in the creation of art.
</P>
<P>
   And if the task is approached with humility, one can at least
show a few fragments of this overwhelming history.
</P>
<P>
   Art, to begin with, is about power, plain and simple; about who
owns the tools, who makes the rules, who gets to shape the image of
the world.

released last week contain clues collected by a Canadian-American
satellite expected to help in forecasting the fate of low-lying
parts of the world, including Bangladesh, the Netherlands and New
York City. Environmentalists are keenly interested in Antarctica
because of the possibility that some of its gigantic ice cap, which
contains about 90 percent of the world's ice, could slide into the
sea. If just part of the ice cap _ the West Antarctic Ice Sheet _
should do this, global sea level would swiftly rise by about 17
feet, inundating coastal regions everywhere with catastrophic

   SCI-BRAZIL-SKULL (Rio de Janeiro) _ A human skull at the
National Museum of Brazil here has been attracting crowds and
controversy in equal measure since it was unveiled this month.
After two decades in storage, the skull has now been identified as
the oldest human remains ever recovered in the Western Hemisphere.
The skull is that of a young woman believed to have roamed the
savannah of south-central Brazil some 11,500 years ago. A
reconstruction of her cranium indicates that her features are
negroid rather than mongoloid, suggesting that the New World may
have initially been settled not only earlier than thought, but by a
people distinct from the ancestors of today's Amerindians. By Larry

   The road from Assisi to Gubbio is sometimes a footpath, a horse
track, a Roman street and now, a gravel road that winds through a
roller-coaster landscape of treeless peaks and deep stream-cut
valleys all dotted with tiny farms and fortresslike monasteries
where 13th-century travelers could spend the night.
</P>
<P>
   It is called the Sentiero Francescano della Pace because it is
the path that Francesco di Bernardone _ better known as St. Francis
_ is believed to have taken after he stood naked in Assisi's
central piazza, renounced family and friends and set out on the
journey that effectively defined the rest of his life as wanderer,
seeker, ultimately saint.
</P>
<P>
   As I shouldered my rucksack on a cold March morning, preparing
to follow his footsteps almost 800 years later, the Piazza del
Comune in Assisi and the streets leading to it, lined with
religious souvenir shops and bars, were empty except for pigeons
and dogs. Bells chimed the hours and robins sang wake-up songs.
</P>
<P>
   All over town, Franciscan monks _ the order of mendicants that
is St. Francis' legacy _ were praying. Soon the roar of cement
trucks and rubble pouring from the blank windows of buildings under
repair filled the town. Since a series of earthquakes in the fall
of 1997, all of Assisi is being restored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take nothing for your journey, no staff, nor bag, nor bread,
nor money.'' That verse from Luke 9:3 spurred St. Francis on.
</P>
<P>
   In similar (if involuntary) spirit, I found that all my money
had been stolen _ not in Italy, but on the airplane from New York,
and though I tried to entertain the joys of disburdenment, I
failed.
</P>
<P>
   Three runners in Lycra sped by, and a nun talked vigorously into
a cell phone clutched to her ear. With my companion, Tony, an
Australian with a Franciscan's hard-won sense of joy, I ambled up
the street to the gate that would lead us out of the walled city.
</P>
<P>
   At Porta Giacomo a blind man stood in the shadows. His eyes were
blue oceans, and under his feet the cobblestones shone, still wet
from the previous night's rain. A hand-carved cane hung from his
folded arms. I stood for a moment, thinking of how St. Francis
passed here on just such a freezing spring day, spiritually blind
as he began his long journey, and literally blind 22 years later
when he was carried back through the gate to die.
</P>
<P>
   The blind man began singing and talking as we passed by, the two
sounds rolling together into squeaks, grunts and held notes. Then
he stamped his feet in place as if he, too, had decided to walk
along.
</P>
<P>
   Blind or sighted, it is impossible to know one's direction. The
path is a place where going never ends, where arriving is always
happening. It is a wavering that receives our falls, a gash in
geology's stacked floor where our uncertain feet break through to
another level.
</P>
<P>
   By the time St. Francis set out for Gubbio, he was beginning to
understand that renunciation means giving up habitual thought.
Conversion was ``a turning around,'' implying as well an
engagement, a conversation with the world. He had already torn away
so much, but there was more to come, and the open road would be his
teacher.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He was not handsome, but said to be beautiful with joy.
Long-faced, sweet-voiced, with large sparkling eyes, Francesco di
Bernardone had oversize ears and eyebrows that drew a line straight
across his forehead. Fun-loving and charismatic, he wooed women
with the troubadour songs of Provence, spending each year's 150
religious holidays sauntering through the Umbrian countryside on
foot and horseback. He was a libertine with an unaffected
generosity and an affinity for nature.
</P>
<P>
   What is it in a life that leads a medieval playboy to sainthood,
and where does the path begin? That's what I wondered as I stepped
onto the Sentiero and followed Francesco's footsteps out of Assisi.
</P>
<P>
   I had been attracted to St. Francis because I'm a walker myself
and have walked away from a life-threatening encounter with
lightning into health. I've lived with the herds and now share a
house with wild birds _ a family of canyon wrens was born in my
bedroom, and a sparrow often perches on a rafter watching me write.
</P>
<P>
   I've loved St. Francis for his unmediated kinship with animals
as well as for his modernity. He could well have been a '60s
radical, casting off convention and everything money can buy, yet
every action had something to teach: He was radical without
bitterness, vital yet gentle, dramatic _ even outrageous at times _
without narcissism.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely, he stepped onto the path out of despair _ a sense
that something was wrong, though he didn't know quite what. His
father, Pietro, was a wealthy cloth merchant who traveled between
Italy and France, and because of his love for things French, he
changed his son's name from Giovanni to Francesco. In training for
the clothier guild of Assisi, the young Francesco was a charming
gadabout, often more elegantly dressed than his clients, and given
to lavish spending when it came to banquets.
</P>
<P>
   Every time Francesco started off on a trip, something happened _
bad weather, bandits, illness, visions, even revelation _ to alter
the meaning of the journey. Sometimes the shortest walk brought the
biggest change.
</P>
<P>
   When Francesco went to San Damiano, a quiet hermitage just below
Assisi's walls, during vespers one day, the crucifix lighted up and
a voice spoke: ``Francis, do you not see how my house is falling
into ruin? Go and repair it for me!''
</P>
<P>
   Francis took the words literally, thinking he was to repair the
crumbling walls of the church. To help with reconstruction, he
stole a horse and bolts of precious fabric from his father's store
and sold them, then offered the money to the priest at San Damiano,
who refused the donation.
</P>
<P>
   When Francis' father discovered the theft, he came after his
son. Francis hid in a cave on Mount Subasio, a mountain that rises
almost straight up behind Assisi and is pocked with limestone caves
known as the Eremo delle Carceri (hermitage cells). Many times,
Francesco took up residence in those frigid grottoes to pray.
Finally regaining his courage, he walked back down.
</P>
<P>
   He was no longer Assisi's man about town but a footsore dharma
bum who had traded in his dandy's silk-and-velvet breeches and
capes for a sackcloth tunic in the sign of the cross, held in place
by a three-knot cord representing his vow of poverty, chastity and
obedience. Once the most popular man in town, he was now viewed as
a madman, as ``God's fool.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pazzo, pazzo,'' his friends yelled. Stones were thrown.
</P>
<P>
   His father seized him, dragged him to the house, tied him in
chains and beat him. When no one was looking, Francis' gentle
mother, Pica, a deeply religious Catholic who believed her son was
on the path to sainthood, set him free.
</P>
<P>
   It was not long before Francis' father caught up with his son
and brought him before the bishop of Assisi in the Piazza del
Comune to be tried as a thief. There, father renounced son, and
Francis in turn famously renounced his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our father who art in heaven. ...'' he began. ``I am the son
of God, not of man.'' He stripped off all his clothes. Standing
naked, he handed his garments and the purse full of money to his
father, then began to walk north to the walled city of Gubbio,
where he planned to stay with a friend.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The road to Gubbio is cobblestone, pavement and gravel that
gives onto a path through what were once forests and are now open
fields. The A.D. 1371 statutes of the Eugubine Comune, now called
Gubbio, state that the road that St. Francis took, ``qua itur
Valfabbrica,'' followed the river Tescio downstream to the village
of Campolongo, then on to a nearby Benedictine monastery, where he
stayed the night.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, he discovered a waterfall, where he washed his
body clean of worldly concerns. Refreshed, he left the river and
walked cross-country over snowy mountaintops.
</P>
<P>
   Each step he took represented an inward peregrination. Walking
and giving, walking and singing, walking and praying: The path was
the proving ground for sainthood, and walking was an ambulation of
heart and mind. Just after the village of Pioppo and before
reaching Valfabbrica, bandits jumped St. Francis, but he had
nothing to give _ only his poverty.
</P>
<P>
   For the bandits to possess his poverty, they would have had to
go naked and divest themselves of all they had previously stolen.
Disgusted, the robbers threw St. Francis into a snowy ditch and ran
off. Francis emerged singing.
</P>
<P>
   Penniless, sick, frail, he had no address. He had never been
ordained. His self-styled vocation, shaky as it seemed at first,
was for redemption and liberation, not the medieval alchemy of
secrecy and poison, and his natural radiance magnetized those near
him.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of taking on the monastic rule of the church, he
abandoned himself to God and the road. He was God's vagabond and
``geography's ant.'' With unimaginable self-discipline, he kept
adjusting to the difficulty of the path, learning to live each
moment in total combustion.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Winter snows lay draped in lazy drifts across the Sentiero. I
took off my shoes and plunged into the snow. The arches of my feet
ached with the cold. After a few moments I put my socks and shoes
back on and, with tingling feet, kept walking. Behind me, to the
south, Mount Subasio showed its back. It was a black wall crowned
with sun-glinting silver.
</P>
<P>
   To walk is to unbalance oneself. Between one step and the next
we become lost. Balance is regained as the foot touches earth, then
it goes as the foot lifts. A path is made of dirt and rock; it is
also a swath of light cut through all that appears to be solid and
unchanging. It is a flesh wound that opens deep in the foot of the
walker, so that what we are, and where we are going, and the way
we've chosen to get there, remains directionless; the traveler is
forever wounded and lost.
</P>
<P>
   Pain, discomfort and groundlessness are the seeker's friends.
Being lost turns into a state of awakeness; it is the same as being
found.
</P>
<P>
   As I walked, I tried to feel his path: how the Sentiero had
opened him; how the Umbrian landscape became the font of
inspiration into which he dipped.
</P>
<P>
   As we trekked out of a deep valley between patches of snow, the
path was lined with blackberry bushes, ginestra (Scotch broom) and
wild iris. Hayfields were thick with bunch grass and clover,
interspersed with wheat, corn, sunflowers, grapes, figs, apples,
plums and walnuts.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to imagine the animals darting out from forest cover to
amble at his side or flutter around his head, but there were no
animals anywhere. So much of this landscape had been changed and
desecrated since St. Francis walked here. Mountains have been
denuded of trees and almost all the animals and birds shot.
</P>
<P>
   In the distance we saw cranes _ what Tony referred to as
``Italy's national bird.'' Not the avian kind but the mechanical
cranes with which tumbled farmhouses are now being restored. Bereft
of life and diversity, the Umbrian beauty seemed surprisingly
shabby.
</P>
<P>
   We passed neat-as-a-pin subsistence farms whose vineyards were
so old as to look like groves of thick-trunked trees. We walked
uphill through Pian della Pieve, then down again toward a
waterfall. Somewhere between San Presto and Collemincio, a farmer
invited us in for coffee. He was small and wiry with huge
dirt-stained hands.
</P>
<P>
   Renato had been born in the house and his wife, Teresa, came
from a farm just up the road. She had recently suffered bouts of
angina and had cut down on the number of cows she milked every day.
Her wide, coarse face opened in a beatific smile as she offered us
pane di San Francesco _ bread with nuts and fruit _ and assured us
that St. Francis had once passed this way.
</P>
<P>
   The house was a series of small rooms connected by a hallway.
Only the kitchen and eating room were heated. Near the fireplace
two large hams hung from the rafters. Every once in a while there
was a thud and the wall shook.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terremoto?'' I asked. They shook their heads, no, no
earthquake. ``It is the cows. They live on the first floor.''
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To embrace poverty meant more than going without. It demanded a
way of living that was all-accommodating. St. Francis disproved the
apparent contradiction that you could spend your life giving when
you possessed nothing. Poverty meant materializing riches from
emptiness. St. Francis' sick body humbled him whenever prayer
failed, enabling him to welcome the disinherited and the sick, and
share their lives with a pure heart because it was his life too.
Between walkabouts he helped care for the lepers, the poor, the
homeless. From emptiness came compassion.
</P>
<P>
   We continued up the road. Farmers pruned grapevines and olive
trees. Stacks of firewood gave way to stacks of roof tiles drying.
A blue tent, distributed after the earthquakes, was still pitched
in one of the yards _ just in case. Not far from there, a whole
village had collapsed during the October earthquake. The yearly
custom of baking a certain kind of bread as an offering against
natural disaster was overlooked in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Now the villagers, all living in tents and containers,
attributed their tragedy to that single lapse. The earthquakes were
a result of ``things that we have done that are bad,'' one resident
told us. Who can say?
</P>
<P>
   We walked a ridge line, dipped into a valley then trudged uphill
again. The air was cold but we were sweating. Farm implements _ a
hay rake and a horse-drawn ditcher _ were 19th century; no sign of
the upcoming millennium here. The week before, we had visited the
Basilica di San Francesco, which was severely shaken by the
earthquakes. The three-story complex sits like a sore thumb at the
west end of Assisi, once a place of execution called the Hill of
Hell.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is referred to as the Hill of Paradise. Deep inside, St.
Francis' bones are locked away in a sepulcher, the immense weight
of the basilica _ a place he would have hated _ weighing down on
top of him.
</P>
<P>
   Four people, including two engineers, were killed when portions
of the vaulted ceiling fell on them during the second of two
earthquakes on Sept. 26. ``A few minutes more and the whole thing
would have come down,'' an injured bystander said.
</P>
<P>
   Brother Daniel, a Franciscan friar from Buffalo, told us the
earthquake was ``a call for us to return to rebuilding our church,
as St. Francis did, a spiritual rebuilding in a time of greed and
battling.''
</P>
<P>
   As we walked under what remained of the Giotto and Cimabue
frescoes, Brother Daniel reminded us that the root word for
obedience means ``to listen.'' As we listened, military planes flew
overhead in the direction of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The walled cities of medieval Italy were fixed universes,
bastions of defense, outlets for commerce, built out of fear. By
turning his back on the religious status quo, St. Francis began to
take the roof off 13th-century superstition and violence by
sticking to the open road and welcoming whatever came his way. His
previous enthusiasms for war, wine, women and song transmigrated
into a divine intoxication with the natural world.
</P>
<P>
   Hunted animals sought refuge at his side. Fish refused to die in
his hands. A pheasant and a rabbit followed him like dogs, as well
as a goat and a hawk. During cold snaps he set out honey for bees
to eat. He talked to flowers when they came into bloom. Sparrows
rode his body like a moving tree, catching rides up and down
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Followers said they saw light wherever he went, that sometimes
his body was lifted up in a silver cloud. By seeing into the
essential nature of things, St. Francis opened the door for animals
to see into him. No skin, no feather, no blood barriers existed. He
used mountains and rivers for words and owl songs and bear grunts
for prayers.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a mistake to think that St. Francis lived a life of
solitude. Quite the opposite. Bernard, Giles, Sylvester, Juniper,
Leo and Elias all joined St. Francis, and together they formed a
brotherhood, walking two by two around Italy, Spain, France and
Switzerland, preaching and praying, meditating in the carceri on
Mount Subasio, living together in the little shacks beside the
chapel at the Porziuncola in the Spoleto Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Francis forbade sadness in his presence, urging laughter and
singing, along with a hefty dose of discipline and a stricture to
keep their vows. Walking tirelessly, they kicked discursive thought
aside (books were forbidden) and lived wide awake.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We walked higher and higher. The Apennine Mountains glistened in
the northeast. Under melting snow, green grass showed through, and
sun came as bright darts stabbing clouds. On a north-facing slope,
waist-high snowbanks stretched across the road: Our footsteps
through them left black holes, like eyes, looking for the next
season.
</P>
<P>
   If St. Francis was hard on himself, he was kind to others. He
refused to shake off the icicles that hung from his robes in the
winter and cut his legs. Yet when one young follower cried of
hunger in the middle of the night, St. Francis didn't reprimand him
for lack of discipline but instead woke the others and prepared a
feast, which they spent the rest of the night eating.
</P>
<P>
   Rain came in heavy curtains and undulated across stippled peaks.
The pencil-point cypresses were stirred by gusts of wind that bent
their tips and straightened them again. If they could write
something, what would they say? Two cars whizzed by, then the
woodcutter's truck passed, laden with dried branches for cooking
fires.
</P>
<P>
   The sky brightened and the sun was suddenly hot. Four gray and
black birds the size of ravens took turns flying across a hayfield
then returning. Rainwater washed back and forth between gathering
clouds, then dropped as snow. A chill ran down my back. I pulled my
hood up, clasped my hands together and kept going.
</P>
<P>
   We crossed the roiling Chiascio River on a high bridge and
walked north. When St. Francis reached this point, he had to knock
on the doors of the Benedictine monastery at Santa Maria di
Valfabbrica because the flooding river was impassable. The monks,
known to be aggressive and rude, grudgingly let him stay.
</P>
<P>
   He was lucky that his rapture was not seen as dangerous or
delusional; the time had not yet come when the Inquisitors were
burning heretics at the stake. A few days later, St. Francis walked
north to La Barcaccia, where he crossed the river by pole barge,
then continued on toward Gubbio.
</P>
<P>
   Pine wind roared. We were on pavement now. Following a steep
mountain road, sheep parted, letting us pass. At Casa Castalda, we
turned left and took the gravel road northwest to Colpalombo. The
hayfields were steep. They looked like green cloths pinned to a
blackboard. What was left of the oak forest was still brown leafed,
dormant, hiding patches of snow that had not yet seen the sun.
Under my feet the flinty soil shattered into a thousand arrows
pointing a hundred different ways.
</P>
<P>
   St. Francis' feet must have been calloused and torn. The
thousands of miles he walked came to stand for the unending inward
journey he was making. He believed that physical suffering would
bring redemption. He called his own body ``Ass'' and the donkey
that sometimes accompanied him ``Brother.'' His tireless exertion
propelled him toward the truth of the human condition, which is
suffering. Each footstep and heartbeat enlarged his capacity to
understand.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As we climbed higher, the temperature dropped. We took a
shortcut through hayfields and trees, then came into a clearing:
Shoals of clouds shifted among reefs of light; the sky was an ocean
and the storms came in waves. I thought of the blind man's eyes,
then of the earthquakes of 1997: of the basilica's roof sections
that fell, the frescoes of Giotto and Cimabue shaken into colored
dust, and how this high spine of central Italy kept wiggling its
back as if trying to shake something off _ a blindness perhaps _ to
make room for a renewed Franciscan simplicity. I looked up. My
mouth must have gone slack: a snowflake alighted on my tongue.
Take. Eat. This is my blood. ...
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We stayed the night in a castle that had once given St. Francis
sanctuary. The old peasant who greeted us was corpulent and, at 9
a.m., red-faced with wine. He was splitting wood with a dull ax.
The interior was frigid. We were taken up three flights of stairs
by a young woman who spoke a bit of English. The room's two immense
arched windows faced north toward Gubbio. Had St. Francis plotted
his trail from this aerie?
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the night a wheel of thunder threw hail at the
window. Lightning showed the peaks of the Apennines one by one. Far
to the north was La Verna, the mountain where the wounds that Jesus
suffered on the cross _ the stigmata _ appeared on St. Francis'
body. Was his experience an agony or did the wounds simply appear?
And how are we to think of them? Are they real or the result of a
collective hallucination?
</P>
<P>
   Three brothers had gone with St. Francis to La Verna, where they
lived in solitude in the caves and said their matins on a rocky
ledge overlooking the valley. On Sept. 17, 1224, Brother Leo later
reported, rays of light fell down on St. Francis' head, and after,
the marks of the crucifying nails in the hands and feet and the
lance that pierced Christ's side showed on St. Francis' body.
</P>
<P>
   I imagine all of La Verna enveloped with light. If Brother Leo
told me this story, I'd say St. Francis had been hit by lightning.
</P>
<P>
   The next day I walked in blackness. Storms lifted like hats,
then slammed down again. Later, the mountains shone with a strange
radiance. We walked into a valley and crossed a frothing stream
whose hoarse voice cried out, ``This way, he went this way.''
</P>
<P>
   We tumbled down, down. Sometimes the river shimmered on our
right and our left _ a brown god _ churning chocolate, white and
red. Gubbio was just ahead. In the valley a chemical factory stood
on the bank. Pavement began. The way to the walled city took us
past more factories, then into suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere on this road St. Francis encountered the legendary
wolf that had been killing people in Gubbio. When beckoned, the
wolf sat at the saint's feet, lowered his head and wagged his tail.
Francis implored the wolf to stop eating people; when he entered
Gubbio with the wolf, the townspeople were astonished. Everyone fed
him, and the wolf never ate a human again.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Approaching Gubbio, we lost our way. A man with a wolfish face
gave us directions. We stayed in a 13th-century hotel near the top
of town, from which everything flowed downhill like lava. Some days
I thought of St. Francis as a living ember plucked from one of
Italy's volcanoes. These mountains were places of retreat for him:
Gubbio, Cortona, Le Celle and La Verna, where his pet hawk woke him
for matins.
</P>
<P>
   Wandering from mountain to mountain, I began to feel his
presence everywhere _ bringing alive the dormant forests and stone
cities that seemed so dead.
</P>
<P>
   Sleep didn't come easily that night. I was perched on the head
of a pin at century's end and didn't know how to proceed. The
medieval European mind was fixated on eternity and driven by
notions of sin and mystery. Now, at the end of the 20th century, we
have traded in linear time for the ever-present Einsteinian time.
</P>
<P>
   Our weak link is not a Christian tragedy we are powerless to
escape but the nihilism of living in the ever-present Present. To
find the path through a continuum takes another kind of imagination
and tenacity.
</P>
<P>
   All I knew was that the path moved. It was not a solid place but
a continuous unfolding. It could be described as a road where
everything changes and is made of dirt, stone, space, light, twigs
broken by hard winds, indentations where hailstones hit earth, hoof
prints, bird tracks and litter from humans passing.
</P>
<P>
   If the path represents the intrinsic poverty and humbleness of
all things, it is also a richness, functioning as a lens through
which we can see things as they really are, without the
embellishment of our ideas about them.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the week the temperature soared, and a blue haze
rose up from the valley, where the farmers were burning pruned
branches from vineyards and olive trees. A friend came for us and
drove us back to the center of Assisi.
</P>
<P>
   A woman in dark glasses, high heels and a mink coat walked her
whippet. Two men, both tipsy, their car doors opened wide, stood
listening to a CD of Frank Sinatra. (His real name, of course, was
Francis.) In the Piazza del Comune, the Irish setter that always
lay in front of the confectionery store was gone. Teen-agers
lounged on the steps of the Temple of Minerva.
</P>
<P>
   By the time St. Francis reached his mid-40s, his pace had
slowed. For the last two years of his life, the stigmata were
oozing sores, compounding a frailty already complicated with
malaria, malnutrition, tuberculosis, rheumatism and what was
probably glaucoma, which made it impossible for him to tolerate
light.
</P>
<P>
   Brother Elias predicted that he would soon die. The people of
Assisi sent knights to Nocera Umbra to bring St. Francis back on
the eve of his death. His final ride through Porta Perlici was on a
palanquin because he was too weak to walk or ride. After blessing
the town that had earlier repudiated him, he begged to be taken
down into the valley to his beloved chapel at Porziuncola.
</P>
<P>
   There, his friends came and said goodbye. Ignoring his own ban
on being in the presence of women, his last visitor was a woman.
Her name was Giacoba dei Settesoli, and she had brought his
favorite food: an almond frangipani, which he ate with pleasure.
After, his final request was honored: He was laid naked on the cold
floor of the Porziuncola to die.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Assisi had originally been called ``asceti,'' which means ``a
place of rising.'' St. Francis died on Oct. 3, 1226. At the moment
of death, light shone from his body and the bells at San Stefano
began ringing spontaneously. The oak forests in the mountains where
he loved to walk were dormant then, as now. I stared up at the
endless series of peaks. The white eyelash on Mount Subasio _ all
that was left of the previous week's snow _ had almost melted. Down
in the valleys the fruit trees stood white with blossoms.
</P>
<P>
   Spring weather is capricious, not unlike the way death comes. I
thought of the pleasure St. Francis must have felt each time he hit
the open road. As it was with Jesus and the Gautama Buddha, the
poet Matsuo Basho and the great Ch'an masters of China and Japan,
all teachings were given on the move, under an open sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not so much traveling as just stopping here and
there,'' Matsuo Basho said. The divinity of a place rose up through
the soles of their feet and went everywhere with them.
</P>
<P>
   Walking back to our rooms on a narrow street, Tony and I heard a
roar. For a moment we thought it might be an earthquake _ the day
before there had been a tremor in the nearby town of Gualdo Tadino
_ but it was only distant thunder, another spring storm passing by.
</P>
<P>
   I paused at the bottom of the stairs. Two parakeets were feeding
each other water. Pots of primroses had been set out. The qualities
I most cherished about St. Francis were these: inexhaustible
tenderness. Unconditional living.
</P>
<P>
   A raindrop came out of the dark and hit my forehead _ just one.
An opening in the clouds revealed stars. I climbed the stairs to my
room, cracked the window wide and went to bed.
</P>

<P>
   The road from Assisi to Gubbio is sometimes a footpath, a horse
track, a Roman street and now, a gravel road that winds through a
roller-coaster landscape of treeless peaks and deep stream-cut
valleys all dotted with tiny farms and fortresslike monasteries
where 13th-century travelers could spend the night.
</P>
<P>
   It is called the Sentiero Francescano della Pace because it is
the path that Francesco di Bernardone _ better known as St. Francis
_ is believed to have taken after he stood naked in Assisi's
central piazza, renounced family and friends and set out on the
journey that effectively defined the rest of his life as wanderer,
seeker, ultimately saint.
</P>
<P>
   As I shouldered my rucksack on a cold March morning, preparing
to follow his footsteps almost 800 years later, the Piazza del
Comune in Assisi and the streets leading to it, lined with
religious souvenir shops and bars, were empty except for pigeons
and dogs. Bells chimed the hours and robins sang wake-up songs.
</P>
<P>
   All over town, Franciscan monks _ the order of mendicants that
is St. Francis' legacy _ were praying. Soon the roar of cement
trucks and rubble pouring from the blank windows of buildings under
repair filled the town. Since a series of earthquakes in the fall
of 1997, all of Assisi is being restored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take nothing for your journey, no staff, nor bag, nor bread,
nor money.'' That verse from Luke 9:3 spurred St. Francis on.
</P>
<P>
   In similar (if involuntary) spirit, I found that all my money
had been stolen _ not in Italy, but on the airplane from New York,
and though I tried to entertain the joys of disburdenment, I
failed.
</P>
<P>
   Three runners in Lycra sped by, and a nun talked vigorously into
a cell phone clutched to her ear. With my companion, Tony, an
Australian with a Franciscan's hard-won sense of joy, I ambled up
the street to the gate that would lead us out of the walled city.
</P>
<P>
   At Porta Giacomo a blind man stood in the shadows. His eyes were
blue oceans, and under his feet the cobblestones shone, still wet
from the previous night's rain. A hand-carved cane hung from his
folded arms. I stood for a moment, thinking of how St. Francis
passed here on just such a freezing spring day, spiritually blind
as he began his long journey, and literally blind 22 years later
when he was carried back through the gate to die.
</P>
<P>
   The blind man began singing and talking as we passed by, the two
sounds rolling together into squeaks, grunts and held notes. Then
he stamped his feet in place as if he, too, had decided to walk
along.
</P>
<P>
   Blind or sighted, it is impossible to know one's direction. The
path is a place where going never ends, where arriving is always
happening. It is a wavering that receives our falls, a gash in
geology's stacked floor where our uncertain feet break through to
another level.
</P>
<P>
   By the time St. Francis set out for Gubbio, he was beginning to
understand that renunciation means giving up habitual thought.
Conversion was ``a turning around,'' implying as well an
engagement, a conversation with the world. He had already torn away
so much, but there was more to come, and the open road would be his
teacher.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He was not handsome, but said to be beautiful with joy.
Long-faced, sweet-voiced, with large sparkling eyes, Francesco di
Bernardone had oversize ears and eyebrows that drew a line straight
across his forehead. Fun-loving and charismatic, he wooed women
with the troubadour songs of Provence, spending each year's 150
religious holidays sauntering through the Umbrian countryside on
foot and horseback. He was a libertine with an unaffected
generosity and an affinity for nature.
</P>
<P>
   What is it in a life that leads a medieval playboy to sainthood,
and where does the path begin? That's what I wondered as I stepped
onto the Sentiero and followed Francesco's footsteps out of Assisi.
</P>
<P>
   I had been attracted to St. Francis because I'm a walker myself
and have walked away from a life-threatening encounter with
lightning into health. I've lived with the herds and now share a
house with wild birds _ a family of canyon wrens was born in my
bedroom, and a sparrow often perches on a rafter watching me write.
</P>
<P>
   I've loved St. Francis for his unmediated kinship with animals
as well as for his modernity. He could well have been a '60s
radical, casting off convention and everything money can buy, yet
every action had something to teach: He was radical without
bitterness, vital yet gentle, dramatic _ even outrageous at times _
without narcissism.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely, he stepped onto the path out of despair _ a sense
that something was wrong, though he didn't know quite what. His
father, Pietro, was a wealthy cloth merchant who traveled between
Italy and France, and because of his love for things French, he
changed his son's name from Giovanni to Francesco. In training for
the clothier guild of Assisi, the young Francesco was a charming
gadabout, often more elegantly dressed than his clients, and given
to lavish spending when it came to banquets.
</P>
<P>
   Every time Francesco started off on a trip, something happened _
bad weather, bandits, illness, visions, even revelation _ to alter
the meaning of the journey. Sometimes the shortest walk brought the
biggest change.
</P>
<P>
   When Francesco went to San Damiano, a quiet hermitage just below
Assisi's walls, during vespers one day, the crucifix lighted up and
a voice spoke: ``Francis, do you not see how my house is falling
into ruin? Go and repair it for me!''
</P>
<P>
   Francis took the words literally, thinking he was to repair the
crumbling walls of the church. To help with reconstruction, he
stole a horse and bolts of precious fabric from his father's store
and sold them, then offered the money to the priest at San Damiano,
who refused the donation.
</P>
<P>
   When Francis' father discovered the theft, he came after his
son. Francis hid in a cave on Mount Subasio, a mountain that rises
almost straight up behind Assisi and is pocked with limestone caves
known as the Eremo delle Carceri (hermitage cells). Many times,
Francesco took up residence in those frigid grottoes to pray.
Finally regaining his courage, he walked back down.
</P>
<P>
   He was no longer Assisi's man about town but a footsore dharma
bum who had traded in his dandy's silk-and-velvet breeches and
capes for a sackcloth tunic in the sign of the cross, held in place
by a three-knot cord representing his vow of poverty, chastity and
obedience. Once the most popular man in town, he was now viewed as
a madman, as ``God's fool.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pazzo, pazzo,'' his friends yelled. Stones were thrown.
</P>
<P>
   His father seized him, dragged him to the house, tied him in
chains and beat him. When no one was looking, Francis' gentle
mother, Pica, a deeply religious Catholic who believed her son wason the path to sainthood, set him free.
</P>
<P>
   It was not long before Francis' father caught up with his son
and brought him before the bishop of Assisi in the Piazza del
Comune to be tried as a thief. There, father renounced son, and
Francis in turn famously renounced his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our father who art in heaven. ...'' he began. ``I am the son
of God, not of man.'' He stripped off all his clothes. Standing
naked, he handed his garments and the purse full of money to his
father, then began to walk north to the walled city of Gubbio,
where he planned to stay with a friend.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The road to Gubbio is cobblestone, pavement and gravel that
gives onto a path through what were once forests and are now open
fields. The A.D. 1371 statutes of the Eugubine Comune, now called
Gubbio, state that the road that St. Francis took, ``qua itur
Valfabbrica,'' followed the river Tescio downstream to the village
of Campolongo, then on to a nearby Benedictine monastery, where he
stayed the night.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, he discovered a waterfall, where he washed his
body clean of worldly concerns. Refreshed, he left the river and
walked cross-country over snowy mountaintops.
</P>
<P>
   Each step he took represented an inward peregrination. Walking
and giving, walking and singing, walking and praying: The path was
the proving ground for sainthood, and walking was an ambulation of
heart and mind. Just after the village of Pioppo and before
reaching Valfabbrica, bandits jumped St. Francis, but he had
nothing to give _ only his poverty.
</P>
<P>
   For the bandits to possess his poverty, they would have had to
go naked and divest themselves of all they had previously stolen.
Disgusted, the robbers threw St. Francis into a snowy ditch and ran
off. Francis emerged singing.
</P>
<P>
   Penniless, sick, frail, he had no address. He had never been
ordained. His self-styled vocation, shaky as it seemed at first,
was for redemption and liberation, not the medieval alchemy of
secrecy and poison, and his natural radiance magnetized those near
him.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of taking on the monastic rule of the church, he
abandoned himself to God and the road. He was God's vagabond and
``geography's ant.'' With unimaginable self-discipline, he kept
adjusting to the difficulty of the path, learning to live each
moment in total combustion.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Winter snows lay draped in lazy drifts across the Sentiero. I
took off my shoes and plunged into the snow. The arches of my feet
ached with the cold. After a few moments I put my socks and shoes
back on and, with tingling feet, kept walking. Behind me, to the
south, Mount Subasio showed its back. It was a black wall crowned
with sun-glinting silver.
</P>
<P>
   To walk is to unbalance oneself. Between one step and the next
we become lost. Balance is regained as the foot touches earth, then
it goes as the foot lifts. A path is made of dirt and rock; it is
also a swath of light cut through all that appears to be solid and
unchanging. It is a flesh wound that opens deep in the foot of the
walker, so that what we are, and where we are going, and the way
we've chosen to get there, remains directionless; the traveler is
forever wounded and lost.
</P>
<P>
   Pain, discomfort and groundlessness are the seeker's friends.
Being lost turns into a state of awakeness; it is the same as being
found.
</P>
<P>
   As I walked, I tried to feel his path: how the Sentiero had
opened him; how the Umbrian landscape became the font of
inspiration into which he dipped.
</P>
<P>
   As we trekked out of a deep valley between patches of snow, the
path was lined with blackberry bushes, ginestra (Scotch broom) and
wild iris. Hayfields were thick with bunch grass and clover,
interspersed with wheat, corn, sunflowers, grapes, figs, apples,
plums and walnuts.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to imagine the animals darting out from forest cover to
amble at his side or flutter around his head, but there were no
animals anywhere. So much of this landscape had been changed and
desecrated since St. Francis walked here. Mountains have been
denuded of trees and almost all the animals and birds shot.
</P>
<P>
   In the distance we saw cranes _ what Tony referred to as
``Italy's national bird.'' Not the avian kind but the mechanical
cranes with which tumbled farmhouses are now being restored. Bereft
of life and diversity, the Umbrian beauty seemed surprisingly
shabby.
</P>
<P>
   We passed neat-as-a-pin subsistence farms whose vineyards were
so old as to look like groves of thick-trunked trees. We walked
uphill through Pian della Pieve, then down again toward a
waterfall. Somewhere between San Presto and Collemincio, a farmer
invited us in for coffee. He was small and wiry with huge
dirt-stained hands.
</P>
<P>
   Renato had been born in the house and his wife, Teresa, came
from a farm just up the road. She had recently suffered bouts of
angina and had cut down on the number of cows she milked every day.
Her wide, coarse face opened in a beatific smile as she offered us
pane di San Francesco _ bread with nuts and fruit _ and assured us
that St. Francis had once passed this way.
</P>
<P>
   The house was a series of small rooms connected by a hallway.
Only the kitchen and eating room were heated. Near the fireplace
two large hams hung from the rafters. Every once in a while there
was a thud and the wall shook.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terremoto?'' I asked. They shook their heads, no, no
earthquake. ``It is the cows. They live on the first floor.''
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To embrace poverty meant more than going without. It demanded a
way of living that was all-accommodating. St. Francis disproved the
apparent contradiction that you could spend your life giving when
you possessed nothing. Poverty meant materializing riches from
emptiness. St. Francis' sick body humbled him whenever prayer
failed, enabling him to welcome the disinherited and the sick, and
share their lives with a pure heart because it was his life too.
Between walkabouts he helped care for the lepers, the poor, the
homeless. From emptiness came compassion.
</P>
<P>
   We continued up the road. Farmers pruned grapevines and olive
trees. Stacks of firewood gave way to stacks of roof tiles drying.
A blue tent, distributed after the earthquakes, was still pitched
in one of the yards _ just in case. Not far from there, a whole
village had collapsed during the October earthquake. The yearly
custom of baking a certain kind of bread as an offering against
natural disaster was overlooked in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Now the villagers, all living in tents and containers,
attributed their tragedy to that single lapse. The earthquakes were
a result of ``things that we have done that are bad,'' one resident
told us. Who can say?
</P>
<P>
   We walked a ridge line, dipped into a valley then trudged uphill
again. The air was cold but we were sweating. Farm implements _ a
hay rake and a horse-drawn ditcher _ were 19th century; no sign of
the upcoming millennium here. The week before, we had visited the
Basilica di San Francesco, which was severely shaken by the
earthquakes. The three-story complex sits like a sore thumb at the
west end of Assisi, once a place of execution called the Hill of
Hell.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is referred to as the Hill of Paradise. Deep inside, St.
Francis' bones are locked away in a sepulcher, the immense weight
of the basilica _ a place he would have hated _ weighing down on
top of him.
</P>
<P>
   Four people, including two engineers, were killed when portions
of the vaulted ceiling fell on them during the second of two
earthquakes on Sept. 26. ``A few minutes more and the whole thing
would have come down,'' an injured bystander said.
</P>
<P>
   Brother Daniel, a Franciscan friar from Buffalo, told us the
earthquake was ``a call for us to return to rebuilding our church,
as St. Francis did, a spiritual rebuilding in a time of greed and
battling.''
</P>
<P>
   As we walked under what remained of the Giotto and Cimabue
frescoes, Brother Daniel reminded us that the root word for
obedience means ``to listen.'' As we listened, military planes flew
overhead in the direction of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The walled cities of medieval Italy were fixed universes,
bastions of defense, outlets for commerce, built out of fear. By
turning his back on the religious status quo, St. Francis began to
take the roof off 13th-century superstition and violence by
sticking to the open road and welcoming whatever came his way. His
previous enthusiasms for war, wine, women and song transmigrated
into a divine intoxication with the natural world.
</P>
<P>
   Hunted animals sought refuge at his side. Fish refused to die in
his hands. A pheasant and a rabbit followed him like dogs, as well
as a goat and a hawk. During cold snaps he set out honey for bees
to eat. He talked to flowers when they came into bloom. Sparrows
rode his body like a moving tree, catching rides up and down
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Followers said they saw light wherever he went, that sometimes
his body was lifted up in a silver cloud. By seeing into the
essential nature of things, St. Francis opened the door for animals
to see into him. No skin, no feather, no blood barriers existed. He
used mountains and rivers for words and owl songs and bear grunts
for prayers.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a mistake to think that St. Francis lived a life of
solitude. Quite the opposite. Bernard, Giles, Sylvester, Juniper,
Leo and Elias all joined St. Francis, and together they formed a
brotherhood, walking two by two around Italy, Spain, France and
Switzerland, preaching and praying, meditating in the carceri on
Mount Subasio, living together in the little shacks beside the
chapel at the Porziuncola in the Spoleto Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Francis forbade sadness in his presence, urging laughter and
singing, along with a hefty dose of discipline and a stricture to
keep their vows. Walking tirelessly, they kicked discursive thought
aside (books were forbidden) and lived wide awake.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We walked higher and higher. The Apennine Mountains glistened in
the northeast. Under melting snow, green grass showed through, and
sun came as bright darts stabbing clouds. On a north-facing slope,
waist-high snowbanks stretched across the road: Our footsteps
through them left black holes, like eyes, looking for the next
season.
</P>
<P>
   If St. Francis was hard on himself, he was kind to others. He
refused to shake off the icicles that hung from his robes in the
winter and cut his legs. Yet when one young follower cried of
hunger in the middle of the night, St. Francis didn't reprimand him
for lack of discipline but instead woke the others and prepared a
feast, which they spent the rest of the night eating.
</P>
<P>
   Rain came in heavy curtains and undulated across stippled peaks.
The pencil-point cypresses were stirred by gusts of wind that bent
their tips and straightened them again. If they could write
something, what would they say? Two cars whizzed by, then the
woodcutter's truck passed, laden with dried branches for cooking
fires.
</P>
<P>
   The sky brightened and the sun was suddenly hot. Four gray and
black birds the size of ravens took turns flying across a hayfield
then returning. Rainwater washed back and forth between gathering
clouds, then dropped as snow. A chill ran down my back. I pulled my
hood up, clasped my hands together and kept going.
</P>
<P>
   We crossed the roiling Chiascio River on a high bridge and
walked north. When St. Francis reached this point, he had to knock
on the doors of the Benedictine monastery at Santa Maria di
Valfabbrica because the flooding river was impassable. The monks,
known to be aggressive and rude, grudgingly let him stay.
</P>
<P>
   He was lucky that his rapture was not seen as dangerous or
delusional; the time had not yet come when the Inquisitors were
burning heretics at the stake. A few days later, St. Francis walked
north to La Barcaccia, where he crossed the river by pole barge,
then continued on toward Gubbio.
</P>
<P>
   Pine wind roared. We were on pavement now. Following a steep
mountain road, sheep parted, letting us pass. At Casa Castalda, we
turned left and took the gravel road northwest to Colpalombo. The
hayfields were steep. They looked like green cloths pinned to a
blackboard. What was left of the oak forest was still brown leafed,
dormant, hiding patches of snow that had not yet seen the sun.
Under my feet the flinty soil shattered into a thousand arrows
pointing a hundred different ways.
</P>
<P>
   St. Francis' feet must have been calloused and torn. The
thousands of miles he walked came to stand for the unending inward
journey he was making. He believed that physical suffering would
bring redemption. He called his own body ``Ass'' and the donkey
that sometimes accompanied him ``Brother.'' His tireless exertion
propelled him toward the truth of the human condition, which is
suffering. Each footstep and heartbeat enlarged his capacity to
understand.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As we climbed higher, the temperature dropped. We took a
shortcut through hayfields and trees, then came into a clearing:
Shoals of clouds shifted among reefs of light; the sky was an ocean
and the storms came in waves. I thought of the blind man's eyes,
then of the earthquakes of 1997: of the basilica's roof sections
that fell, the frescoes of Giotto and Cimabue shaken into colored
dust, and how this high spine of central Italy kept wiggling its
back as if trying to shake something off _ a blindness perhaps _ to
make room for a renewed Franciscan simplicity. I looked up. My
mouth must have gone slack: a snowflake alighted on my tongue.
Take. Eat. This is my blood. ...
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We stayed the night in a castle that had once given St. Francis
sanctuary. The old peasant who greeted us was corpulent and, at 9
a.m., red-faced with wine. He was splitting wood with a dull ax.
The interior was frigid. We were taken up three flights of stairs
by a young woman who spoke a bit of English. The room's two immense
arched windows faced north toward Gubbio. Had St. Francis plotted
his trail from this aerie?
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the night a wheel of thunder threw hail at the
window. Lightning showed the peaks of the Apennines one by one. Far
to the north was La Verna, the mountain where the wounds that Jesus
suffered on the cross _ the stigmata _ appeared on St. Francis'
body. Was his experience an agony or did the wounds simply appear?
And how are we to think of them? Are they real or the result of a
collective hallucination?
</P>
<P>
   Three brothers had gone with St. Francis to La Verna, where they
lived in solitude in the caves and said their matins on a rocky
ledge overlooking the valley. On Sept. 17, 1224, Brother Leo later
reported, rays of light fell down on St. Francis' head, and after,
the marks of the crucifying nails in the hands and feet and the
lance that pierced Christ's side showed on St. Francis' body.
</P>
<P>
   I imagine all of La Verna enveloped with light. If Brother Leo
told me this story, I'd say St. Francis had been hit by lightning.
</P>
<P>
   The next day I walked in blackness. Storms lifted like hats,
then slammed down again. Later, the mountains shone with a strange
radiance. We walked into a valley and crossed a frothing stream
whose hoarse voice cried out, ``This way, he went this way.''
</P>
<P>
   We tumbled down, down. Sometimes the river shimmered on our
right and our left _ a brown god _ churning chocolate, white and
red. Gubbio was just ahead. In the valley a chemical factory stood
on the bank. Pavement began. The way to the walled city took us
past more factories, then into suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere on this road St. Francis encountered the legendary
wolf that had been killing people in Gubbio. When beckoned, the
wolf sat at the saint's feet, lowered his head and wagged his tail.
Francis implored the wolf to stop eating people; when he entered
Gubbio with the wolf, the townspeople were astonished. Everyone fed
him, and the wolf never ate a human again.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Approaching Gubbio, we lost our way. A man with a wolfish face
gave us directions. We stayed in a 13th-century hotel near the top
of town, from which everything flowed downhill like lava. Some days
I thought of St. Francis as a living ember plucked from one of
Italy's volcanoes. These mountains were places of retreat for him:
Gubbio, Cortona, Le Celle and La Verna, where his pet hawk woke him
for matins.
</P>
<P>
   Wandering from mountain to mountain, I began to feel his
presence everywhere _ bringing alive the dormant forests and stone
cities that seemed so dead.
</P>
<P>
   Sleep didn't come easily that night. I was perched on the head
of a pin at century's end and didn't know how to proceed. The
medieval European mind was fixated on eternity and driven by
notions of sin and mystery. Now, at the end of the 20th century, we
have traded in linear time for the ever-present Einsteinian time.
</P>
<P>
   Our weak link is not a Christian tragedy we are powerless to
escape but the nihilism of living in the ever-present Present. To
find the path through a continuum takes another kind of imagination
and tenacity.
</P>
<P>
   All I knew was that the path moved. It was not a solid place but
a continuous unfolding. It could be described as a road where
everything changes and is made of dirt, stone, space, light, twigs
broken by hard winds, indentations where hailstones hit earth, hoof
prints, bird tracks and litter from humans passing.
</P>
<P>
   If the path represents the intrinsic poverty and humbleness of
all things, it is also a richness, functioning as a lens through
which we can see things as they really are, without the
embellishment of our ideas about them.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the week the temperature soared, and a blue haze
rose up from the valley, where the farmers were burning pruned
branches from vineyards and olive trees. A friend came for us and
drove us back to the center of Assisi.
</P>
<P>
   A woman in dark glasses, high heels and a mink coat walked her
whippet. Two men, both tipsy, their car doors opened wide, stood
listening to a CD of Frank Sinatra. (His real name, of course, was
Francis.) In the Piazza del Comune, the Irish setter that always
lay in front of the confectionery store was gone. Teen-agers
lounged on the steps of the Temple of Minerva.
</P>
<P>
   By the time St. Francis reached his mid-40s, his pace had
slowed. For the last two years of his life, the stigmata were
oozing sores, compounding a frailty already complicated with
malaria, malnutrition, tuberculosis, rheumatism and what was
probably glaucoma, which made it impossible for him to tolerate
light.
</P>
<P>
   Brother Elias predicted that he would soon die. The people of
Assisi sent knights to Nocera Umbra to bring St. Francis back on
the eve of his death. His final ride through Porta Perlici was on a
palanquin because he was too weak to walk or ride. After blessing
the town that had earlier repudiated him, he begged to be taken
down into the valley to his beloved chapel at Porziuncola.
</P>
<P>
   There, his friends came and said goodbye. Ignoring his own ban
on being in the presence of women, his last visitor was a woman.
Her name was Giacoba dei Settesoli, and she had brought his
favorite food: an almond frangipani, which he ate with pleasure.
After, his final request was honored: He was laid naked on the cold
floor of the Porziuncola to die.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Assisi had originally been called ``asceti,'' which means ``a
place of rising.'' St. Francis died on Oct. 3, 1226. At the moment
of death, light shone from his body and the bells at San Stefano
began ringing spontaneously. The oak forests in the mountains where
he loved to walk were dormant then, as now. I stared up at the
endless series of peaks. The white eyelash on Mount Subasio _ all
that was left of the previous week's snow _ had almost melted. Down
in the valleys the fruit trees stood white with blossoms.
</P>
<P>
   Spring weather is capricious, not unlike the way death comes. I
thought of the pleasure St. Francis must have felt each time he hit
the open road. As it was with Jesus and the Gautama Buddha, the
poet Matsuo Basho and the great Ch'an masters of China and Japan,
all teachings were given on the move, under an open sky.
</P>
<P>

   Walking back to our rooms on a narrow street, Tony and I heard a
roar. For a moment we thought it might be an earthquake _ the day
before there had been a tremor in the nearby town of Gualdo Tadino
_ but it was only distant thunder, another spring storm passing by.
</P>
<P>
   I paused at the bottom of the stairs. Two parakeets were feeding
each other water. Pots of primroses had been set out. The qualities
I most cherished about St. Francis were these: inexhaustible
tenderness. Unconditional living.

<P>
   A raindrop came out of the dark and hit my forehead _ just one.
An opening in the clouds revealed stars. I climbed the stairs to my
room, cracked the window wide and went to bed.

BANKS GEAR UP FOR NEW YEAR WITH Y2K PRECAUTIONS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   COHOES, N.Y. _ Planning to make a large cash withdrawal from the
bank before New Year's Eve? You will most likely get an earful
before you get your money.
</P>
<P>
   Cohoes Savings Bank in suburban Albany is one of hundreds of
financial institutions making tellers the last defense against
people emptying their bank accounts for fear of problems related to
the year 2000, or Y2K, computer glitch. Doing all they can to
eradicate Y2K fears, banks are training their employees to watch
for uncharacteristically large cash withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   When tellers notice such activities, they have been taught to
reassure the customer about the bank's Y2K compliance _ and to try
to persuade them to leave their money where it is.
</P>
<P>
   At Cohoes Savings, for instance, a large cash withdrawal could
prompt a teller to casually inquire, ``Is this for a purchase?'' If
it isn't, bank President Harry Robinson said, counseling will
follow.
</P>
<P>
   No bank can stop you from taking out your own money, of course.
But they can still try to change your mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``At home under the mattress is not the place for money,''
Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few months, education has been a big part of the Y2K
work banks have done. Some banks, like Cohoes, have held public
meetings to talk about preparations for any computer problems. If
such efforts don't work, the tellers will do the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our customers are not real worried about it,'' said
Debbie Roylance, a teller at Cohoes. ``The ones that are, we just
basically just tell them, `Remain calm.'''
</P>
<P>
   Banks are required to inform the Internal Revenue Service if a
customer takes out more than $10,000 in cash from their account.
But sometimes even smaller withdrawals are enough to raise the
eyebrow of a teller, prompting an inquiry. At some banks, $2,500
could be enough.
</P>
<P>
   Experts believe that computers originally programmed to
recognize only the last two digits of a year may fail or
malfunction on Jan. 1, 2000, when the machines may assume it is
1900. But businesses and government agencies have taken
precautions, largely by replacing older computers and software.
</P>
<P>
   Americans would be hard-pressed to find an industry more
prepared than banks. Strict government oversight requires that
banks report their Y2K work regularly. And even if there were a Y2K
problem, all records are backed up on hard copy, and the cash
itself would still be in the vault.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, as banks are so happy to point out, individual
accounts are ensured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
up to $100,000 per person.
</P>
<P>
   A rush on banks before New Year's Eve, depleting cash supplies,
is not likely, according to the Federal Reserve Board. There is
$200 billion in circulation, with another $200 billion in reserve
vaults.
</P>
<P>
   If banks lose cash, they also lose profit. But today, banks say
their biggest worry is that their customers will take out money and
then lose it to a fire, burglar or scam artist.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K scams have been spotted around the country. Over the
telephone, people have been asked for their credit card or bank
account number, under the guise of fixing the problem.
</P>
<P>
   One phone scam works like this: A caller tells a victim that
their bank or credit card account is no good, and tries to get them
to give their account number over the phone so they can ``check.''
Others prey on the elderly, telling them paper money will be
useless and encouraging them to mail their cash to a certain
address to buy gold.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, those who reported the scams were not victimized.
Others have not been so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   In Cramerton, N.C., last March, a man lost $15,000 in cash and
coins when a teen-age relative broke into a home filing cabinet.
The victim had withdrawn money from his 401(k) retirement fund to
invest in gold and silver coins because of what he heard about Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   And in Hong Kong recently, a woman handed over $15,440 to buy
pills from con men who told her they would cure the millennium
``bug.''
</P>
<P>
   Some banks plan to suggest traveler's checks or a cashier's
check to customers who insist on withdrawing money because of the
Y2K glitch.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, these options do not provide the comfort and
immediacy of cold, hard cash.
</P>
<P>
   A September poll by the Atlanta company Davis and Associates
showed an estimated 31 million U.S. households, just under
one-third of the country's population, plan to take a combined $32
billion out of the bank because of Y2K. That's about an average of
$1,000 per household. That study was based on interviews with 1,008
people.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a recent poll of top corporate executives by CIO magazine
showed that 34 percent planned to have more than $1,000 on hand.
And a Gallup poll released last month showed that 25 percent of
those quizzed were planning to take extra cash out.

   Feeling that the world was too much with me, I took myself off,
last summer, to Laos. The more my private moments seemed to be
invaded by beeping faxes and ringing phones and half-unwanted
chirps of ``you've got mail,'' the more I felt drawn to a place
that was said to be the sleeping beauty among nations _ ``the
currently favored adjective ``underdeveloped' would be an
unwarranted compliment,'' Time had opined some years before.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as I arrived, I knew why I had come.
</P>
<P>
   In Vientiane, the capital, kids were fishing along the main
street _ an unpaved red-dirt path _ and a call across town involved
ringing an operator, waiting for her to call back and then tugging
gently at the wire while speaking in a whisper. At 1 p.m. on the
Friday I arrived, the center of downtown _ Laos' Times Square _
consisted of me, a drowsy rickshaw driver and a fountain with no
water.
</P>
<P>
   When I stepped into my hotel, however _ a simple midprice place
along the Mekong _ I was greeted by the Ghost of Laos Future. A
room beside the lobby blinked with flashing screens accommodating
E-mail needs, and Top Cat was agitating for some pizza on the
Cartoon Network near my bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry, sir,'' said the cashier when I took my leave of
Laos, congratulating him on how (relatively) quiet and unspoiled
his country was. ``Next time you come, we'll have full Internet
connections.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed they will, and another way to flee the all-surrounding
buzz will be lost to us. The fact that we can get anywhere today,
almost instantly, means that we can be got anywhere, all the time.
And the fact that friends and bosses can find us so easily means
that it is ever more difficult to get lost. Beepers, cell phones,
Global Village modems: The only adventure I crave these days is to
get to a place where no one can reach me (and where I, therefore,
can reach a deeper self).
</P>
<P>
   I thought about all this when I got back from Laos, and I
recalled how even in Bhutan, I'd found more video stores than on
Melrose Avenue. In North Korea I'd been surrounded by the Village
People singing ``Y.M.C.A.'' Even in desperately poor Haiti, I'd
received faxes from a New York office through the night. Adventure
today means finding one's way back to the silence and stillness of
a thousand years ago.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that I got into my old Toyota and began driving up the
California coast. I drove for three hours, the freeway dwindling
into a single-lane road, and the scenery by my side turning from
motels into cows and then empty fields. The road began to climb,
running along the ocean, and the signs began to say things like
``Rock Slide Area Next 60 Miles'' and ``Rough Road.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming to a 15-foot cross by the side of the road, I turned onto
an even narrower lane and within five minutes had climbed to a
Benedictine hermitage 1,300 feet above the Pacific Ocean. The last
time I'd visited, the whole place had been almost completely cut
off from the world for more than three months, El Nino rainstorms
having washed away the main road. Now, suddenly, I was in a place
where nothing happens.
</P>
<P>
   What I saw, at the top of the ridge, was a fairly
undistinguished building dating from the late Eisenhower years, and
a small semicircle of rooms arranged as in a motel court, with
numbers on their doors. What I didn't see were phone lines,
television antennae, traffic jams. The presence of all that was
absent was intense.
</P>
<P>
   Entering my compact ``cell,'' I took off my watch and listened
to the emptiness. In front of me, an expanse of blue ocean,
eucalyptus trees along the slope, a small fox on the wooden fence
in my private garden; next to me, some Dawn dishwashing detergent
and a sprig of holly in a bottle labeled ``Balsamic Vinegar.'' I
unpacked a few clothes, and the novels and essays that, on this
journey, seemed the aptest guidebooks. I sat in the small chair in
the garden and watched snatches of mist race up the hillside.
</P>
<P>
   This is, of course, an archetypal adventure, common to every
culture from Basho's to Peter Matthiessen's. Yet it is a voyage
that grows more precious as it grows more elusive, and more and
more of the world tunes in to news on the hour, every hour. And
though I could try to find the same stillness in my quiet mountain
home, unplugging the phone and closing the door firmly, when I've
tried it in the past, I've found myself too hemmed in by the
familiar props of my everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   Here, though no Catholic, I am steadied by the sense of common
purpose; and when I sit in the dark and listen to the rain beating
against the wooden roof, I can feel as if I'm back in some pre- or
post-millennial state of mind described in a holy book. Or in no
time at all.
</P>
<P>
   At some level, I do nothing in the hermitage: I read, I think, I
write to distant friends; several times a day I walk along the same
road I've walked along for eight years now. It is not a
particularly ascetic regimen. The food (set out in the kitchen and
eaten in silence in one's cell) is worthy of a San Francisco
restaurant, instant-coffee makers sit in every heated room and a
bookshop offers tapes and greeting cards and Sufi texts.
</P>
<P>
   Adventure, such a place reminds me, is mostly about forgetting
some things (deadlines, data, dates), the better to remember others
(the people you love, the hopes you've lost sight of). The events
of the day are sunrise, nightfall, stars.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years I've seen the hermitage, like other
pretechnological sites around the nation, grow more and more
popular, as people try to step outside the moment and return to a
Thoreauvian sense of the unknown. Seven years ago, I could show up
here, more or less unannounced, and claim a room for the night; now
I have to make a reservation six months in advance, and guarantee
my suggested donation (of $45 a night) with a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   Which suggests to me, really, that our fascination with the new
only quickens our hunger for the old. Though the hermitage could be
seen as analogous to cyberspace _ it has no boundaries, no bearings
and leaves you alone with your thoughts _ it is distinguished from
that nowhere space precisely by being rooted and ruled, its tolling
bells marking out a centered universe. The one friend of mine who
has also taken the place to heart is, not surprisingly, the one who
showed me a Global Positioning System in his car and flew so often
that he once won the ultimate frequent-flier award _ 30 days of
unlimited travel across the globe.
</P>
<P>
   The monks, whose lives find value in their service to the world,
are delighted, I'm sure, that technology has put their remote
mountain home just a click away from Tibet. They can accept fax
orders for their fruitcake now and share their blessings by E-mail
(monks &LR; contemplation.com). When the roads washed away, a
68-year-old brother drove me in by a back road. A white-hooded
hermit for 38 years, he explained with glee how he had gauged the
day's weather from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The point, I think, is that spurning the uses of the modern
world makes as little sense as surrendering one's soul to them. Yet
``it's never too late,'' as Allen Ginsberg wrote, ``to do nothing
at all.''
</P>

Classical'' and, coming out this winter, ``The Global Soul.'')

purpose; and when I sit in the dark and listen to the rain beating
against the wooden roof, I can feel as if I'm back in some pre- or
post-millennial state of mind described in a holy book. Or in no
time at all.
</P>
<P>
   At some level, I do nothing in the hermitage: I read, I think, I
write to distant friends; several times a day I walk along the same
road I've walked along for eight years now. It is not a
particularly ascetic regimen. The food (set out in the kitchen and
eaten in silence in one's cell) is worthy of a San Francisco
restaurant, instant-coffee makers sit in every heated room and a
bookshop offers tapes and greeting cards and Sufi texts.
</P>
<P>
   Adventure, such a place reminds me, is mostly about forgetting
some things (deadlines, data, dates), the better to remember others
(the people you love, the hopes you've lost sight of). The events
of the day are sunrise, nightfall, stars.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years I've seen the hermitage, like other
pretechnological sites around the nation, grow more and more
popular, as people try to step outside the moment and return to a
Thoreauvian sense of the unknown. Seven years ago, I could show up
here, more or less unannounced, and claim a room for the night; now
I have to make a reservation six months in advance, and guarantee
my suggested donation (of $45 a night) with a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   Which suggests to me, really, that our fascination with the new
only quickens our hunger for the old. Though the hermitage could be
seen as analogous to cyberspace _ it has no boundaries, no bearings
and leaves you alone with your thoughts _ it is distinguished from
that nowhere space precisely by being rooted and ruled, its tolling
bells marking out a centered universe. The one friend of mine who
has also taken the place to heart is, not surprisingly, the one who
showed me a Global Positioning System in his car and flew so often
that he once won the ultimate frequent-flier award _ 30 days of
unlimited travel across the globe.
</P>
<P>
   The monks, whose lives find value in their service to the world,
are delighted, I'm sure, that technology has put their remote
mountain home just a click away from Tibet. They can accept fax
orders for their fruitcake now and share their blessings by E-mail
(monks &LR; contemplation.com). When the roads washed away, a
68-year-old brother drove me in by a back road. A white-hooded
hermit for 38 years, he explained with glee how he had gauged the
day's weather from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The point, I think, is that spurning the uses of the modern
world makes as little sense as surrendering one's soul to them. Yet
``it's never too late,'' as Allen Ginsberg wrote, ``to do nothing
at all.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Feeling that the world was too much with me, I took myself off,
last summer, to Laos. The more my private moments seemed to be
invaded by beeping faxes and ringing phones and half-unwanted
chirps of ``you've got mail,'' the more I felt drawn to a place
that was said to be the sleeping beauty among nations _ ``the
currently favored adjective ``underdeveloped' would be an
unwarranted compliment,'' Time had opined some years before.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as I arrived, I knew why I had come.
</P>
<P>
   In Vientiane, the capital, kids were fishing along the main
street _ an unpaved red-dirt path _ and a call across town involved
ringing an operator, waiting for her to call back and then tugging
gently at the wire while speaking in a whisper. At 1 p.m. on the
Friday I arrived, the center of downtown _ Laos' Times Square _
consisted of me, a drowsy rickshaw driver and a fountain with no
water.
</P>
<P>
   When I stepped into my hotel, however _ a simple midprice place
along the Mekong _ I was greeted by the Ghost of Laos Future. A
room beside the lobby blinked with flashing screens accommodating
E-mail needs, and Top Cat was agitating for some pizza on the
Cartoon Network near my bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry, sir,'' said the cashier when I took my leave of
Laos, congratulating him on how (relatively) quiet and unspoiled
his country was. ``Next time you come, we'll have full Internet
connections.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed they will, and another way to flee the all-surrounding
buzz will be lost to us. The fact that we can get anywhere today,
almost instantly, means that we can be got anywhere, all the time.
And the fact that friends and bosses can find us so easily means
that it is ever more difficult to get lost. Beepers, cell phones,
Global Village modems: The only adventure I crave these days is to
get to a place where no one can reach me (and where I, therefore,
can reach a deeper self).
</P>
<P>
   I thought about all this when I got back from Laos, and I
recalled how even in Bhutan, I'd found more video stores than on
Melrose Avenue. In North Korea I'd been surrounded by the Village
People singing ``Y.M.C.A.'' Even in desperately poor Haiti, I'd
received faxes from a New York office through the night. Adventure
today means finding one's way back to the silence and stillness of
a thousand years ago.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that I got into my old Toyota and began driving up the
California coast. I drove for three hours, the freeway dwindling
into a single-lane road, and the scenery by my side turning from
motels into cows and then empty fields. The road began to climb,
running along the ocean, and the signs began to say things like
``Rock Slide Area Next 60 Miles'' and ``Rough Road.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming to a 15-foot cross by the side of the road, I turned onto
an even narrower lane and within five minutes had climbed to a
Benedictine hermitage 1,300 feet above the Pacific Ocean. The last
time I'd visited, the whole place had been almost completely cut
off from the world for more than three months, El Nino rainstorms
having washed away the main road. Now, suddenly, I was in a place
where nothing happens.
</P>
<P>
   What I saw, at the top of the ridge, was a fairly
undistinguished building dating from the late Eisenhower years, and
a small semicircle of rooms arranged as in a motel court, with
numbers on their doors. What I didn't see were phone lines,
television antennae, traffic jams. The presence of all that was
absent was intense.
</P>
<P>
   Entering my compact ``cell,'' I took off my watch and listened
to the emptiness. In front of me, an expanse of blue ocean,
eucalyptus trees along the slope, a small fox on the wooden fence
in my private garden; next to me, some Dawn dishwashing detergent
and a sprig of holly in a bottle labeled ``Balsamic Vinegar.'' I
unpacked a few clothes, and the novels and essays that, on this
journey, seemed the aptest guidebooks. I sat in the small chair in
the garden and watched snatches of mist race up the hillside.
</P>
<P>
   This is, of course, an archetypal adventure, common to every
culture from Basho's to Peter Matthiessen's. Yet it is a voyage
that grows more precious as it grows more elusive, and more and
more of the world tunes in to news on the hour, every hour. And
though I could try to find the same stillness in my quiet mountain
home, unplugging the phone and closing the door firmly, when I've
tried it in the past, I've found myself too hemmed in by the
familiar props of my everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   Here, though no Catholic, I am steadied by the sense of common
purpose; and when I sit in the dark and listen to the rain beating
against the wooden roof, I can feel as if I'm back in some pre- or
post-millennial state of mind described in a holy book. Or in no
time at all.
</P>
<P>

 c.1999 The New York Times Magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   By age 36, Lord Byron, the original bad boy of English
literature, had made a nation of repressed women swoon despite his
escapades _ he seduced boys and slept with his half sister, and
threw his wife and newborn daughter out of the house _ and had
written one of the great satiric poems of all time, ``Don Juan,''
which he allowed to be understood was partly autobiographical.
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding a malformed foot, he was as famous for his
athletic prowess as for the brand of cynicism that made ``Byronic''
an adjective. We even owe to Byron the classic mother-in-law joke.
His mother-in-law had been dangerously ill, he wrote, but was now
dangerously well again.
</P>
<P>
   He lacked only one thing to insure his immortality: a really
good death. And this came about with perfect filmic melodrama in
1824, while he was leading an ill-planned campaign in Greece's war
of independence against the Turks.
</P>
<P>
   He had outfitted a warship (and gone so far as to design the
men's uniforms _ although even his second in command refused to
take his plumed helmet with the Byron crest out of its pink box).
Then Byron caught a fever; at the end, abandoned by mutinous
troops, he died a gloriously unnecessary death in the marshes at
Missolonghi, bled by his doctors.
</P>
<P>
   If Byron's contemporaries didn't exactly regard that death as a
good career move, we can see it now as a pivotal moment in cultural
history. He and his era gave us the clich of the artist gladly
outraging society, asserting the primacy of his opinion and
claiming absolute indifference to public reaction.
</P>
<P>
   These became essential aspects of Romanticism, and 200 years
later they are still entwined in our definition of creative genius.
Now, however, fame also attaches itself merely to the trappings of
the Byronic persona: the extravagant life style, the operatic
demise. The heroic self, all too often, has degenerated into the
hyped celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   Being over the top has frequently turned out to be a good
business strategy for the ambitious artist. ``I have been attacked
by the government, by the priests and by the newspapers,'' Gustave
Flaubert wrote. ``Nothing is lacking for my triumph.''
</P>
<P>
   Madonna or the painter Francis Bacon could easily have said the
same thing in this century. Controversiality alone doesn't imply
genius or guarantee immortality _ remember Rudi Gernreich? _ but it
obviously doesn't doom an artist to obscurity or poverty either.
</P>
<P>
   Monet, the standard example of the misunderstood Impressionist,
had praise heaped on him and lived his last decades like Croesus in
Giverny. Even van Gogh, whose misery continues to give hope to
every unrecognized artist, came alarmingly close to success before
he shot himself. Had he lived past 40, who knows?
</P>
<P>
   He might have bought the asylum at St.-Remy as a chateau for his
third wife and spent his dotage like Picasso, in saturnalian
excess, sunning on the Riviera.
</P>
<P>
   Even more than writers or painters, composers illustrate best
the Romantic equating of nonconformity with glory. By the late 18th
century, pure instrumental music _ music not written for the king
or the church but simply for the pleasure of an emerging
bourgeoisie _ was coming into its own.
</P>
<P>
   With the rise of a middle class, composers were beginning to
think in terms of public concerts and paying crowds. Musicians like
Liszt and Berlioz, both of them basing works on Byron's poems,
wrote with this new audience in mind.
</P>
<P>
   But religious music had expressed piety; court music, elegance.
They reflected the goals of their subjects. What were the new
symphonies supposed to celebrate? Making money? Individuality
therefore became a prime criterion of artistic value, an excuse for
artists entering a marketplace that many of them claimed to
disdain.
</P>
<P>
   As Charles Rosen, the pianist and writer, has put it, during the
Romantic era ``the work has its own law, its own reason for
existing: it is produced by the artist not for a purpose but
because he must _ ``out of an inner necessity.'''
</P>
<P>
   So the artist now sought to make a living by, as it were,
selling his soul _ his individual sensibility. The more individual
the sensibility, the better the artist _ an idea that naturally
flowed into the larger sphere of politics and public life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Force of mind is developed only by attacking power,'' was Mme.
de Stael's phrase for the concept of the underdog individual versus
the dominating mass, which Byron translated as ``All Talent has a
propensity to attack the Strong.''
</P>
<P>
   If Byron has come to seem to us like a virtual parody of
Romantic excess, it is partly because he refused to stick to any
one esthetic or moral philosophy. He was a freethinker dogged by
Calvinist guilt; he had stood up for the poor but took childish
pride in his aristocracy.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of self-indulgence that Byron embodied involved an
elevation of private esthetics over reason. Enlightenment reason
had lost much of its luster after Robespierre. As a bedrock
ideology for the modern artist, the Romantic credo of individuality
was to become particularly irresistible because it didn't depend on
any one view of the world to which everyone had to conform.
</P>
<P>
   Conformity became the only enemy, which helps to explain why
Romanticism as a historical movement is still so poorly remembered:
it consciously resisted any one definition. The Romantic revolution
was like William Morris's description of a battle that men fight
and lose: ``the thing they fought for comes about in spite of their
defeat,'' Morris wrote, ``and when it comes, turns out not to be
what they meant, and other men have to fight for what they meant
under another name.''
</P>
<P>
   This also seems like a metaphor for the Romantic concept of the
misunderstood genius _ the individual artist of the most
exceptional talent _ although we ought to be careful about
attributing too much, ultimately, to the Romantic age. Victor Hugo,
like Byron a larger-than-life character, fooled around with scraps
of lace dipped in colored ink.
</P>
<P>
   He signed stones that he found on the beach. But we really
haven't the slightest idea whether this meant to Hugo what it
implies to us. We know only that he wasn't a forward thinker about
the art of his time. The critic Sainte-Beuve said that Hugo ``spent
his entire life going from one man to another, helping himself to
whatever they had to offer,'' which was funny coming from
Sainte-Beuve, who had an affair with Hugo's wife. Still, it was an
astute statement: Hugo pointed the way ahead by looking backward,
to what had already been done.
</P>
<P>
   Historians in 100 years may find it more interesting than we do
that so much art in this century was not about individual
expression but the reverse: it was based on one or another of the
various totalitarian forms of collectivism or on the collectivist
philosophy of the artist collaboratives.
</P>
<P>
   Fluxus, the most effervescent of these postwar collectives, was
started by a true original, the Lithuanian-American composer,
collagist and writer George Maciunas, who dressed like an
accountant and thought like Bakunin. He was the antithesis of
Byron, except that, fortunately, he had a sense of humor. With mock
gravity he declared the goal of Fluxus to be to ``destroy the
authorship of pieces and make them totally anonymous.''
</P>
<P>
   And a result was a hodgepodge of experimental publications,
concerts, objects, happenings, games and gags that encapsulate, as
well as anything else, the anything-goes utopian ideals of the
1960's and 70's.
</P>
<P>
   If Fluxus isn't widely known today outside art circles, it is
because anonymity and ephemera also virtually guarantee obscurity,
while Byronic self-aggrandizement remains, of course, the path to
immortality. At the end of the millennium, despite the collectivist
counterreaction in the 20th century, it is still the individual who
inspires the masses.
</P>
<P>
   In Vietnam today there are 1,000 temples dedicated to a cult of
Victor Hugo. Which is nothing compared to the number of albums sold
by Milli Vanilli, the 80's pop duo who faked their way to stardom
by lip-syncing songs recorded for them by other people. The idea of
the heroic individual now having devolved into mere celebrityhood,
modern magazines and television make people famous simply for
having had their pictures taken. Talent isn't necessarily an issue.
</P>
<P>
   The downward historical trajectory goes from William Faulkner's
notion of fame (''to be, as a private individual, abolished and
voided from history, leaving it markless, no refuse save the
printed books'') to Kato Kaelin. Fame, stripped of its old
spiritual sense of everlasting existence derived from valued
accomplishment, accrues these days to Linda Evangelista and Kate
Moss, who look good in advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, if Byron were around, he'd be sleeping with a model.

the art of his time. The critic Sainte-Beuve said that Hugo ``spent
his entire life going from one man to another, helping himself to
whatever they had to offer,'' which was funny coming from
Sainte-Beuve, who had an affair with Hugo's wife. Still, it was an
astute statement: Hugo pointed the way ahead by looking backward,
to what had already been done.
</P>
<P>
   Historians in 100 years may find it more interesting than we do
that so much art in this century was not about individual
expression but the reverse: it was based on one or another of the
various totalitarian forms of collectivism or on the collectivist
philosophy of the artist collaboratives.
</P>
<P>
   Fluxus, the most effervescent of these postwar collectives, was
started by a true original, the Lithuanian-American composer,
collagist and writer George Maciunas, who dressed like an
accountant and thought like Bakunin. He was the antithesis of
Byron, except that, fortunately, he had a sense of humor. With mock
gravity he declared the goal of Fluxus to be to ``destroy the
authorship of pieces and make them totally anonymous.''
</P>
<P>
   And a result was a hodgepodge of experimental publications,
concerts, objects, happenings, games and gags that encapsulate, as
well as anything else, the anything-goes utopian ideals of the
1960's and 70's.
</P>
<P>
   If Fluxus isn't widely known today outside art circles, it is
because anonymity and ephemera also virtually guarantee obscurity,
while Byronic self-aggrandizement remains, of course, the path to
immortality. At the end of the millennium, despite the collectivist
counterreaction in the 20th century, it is still the individual who
inspires the masses.
</P>
<P>
   In Vietnam today there are 1,000 temples dedicated to a cult of
Victor Hugo. Which is nothing compared to the number of albums sold
by Milli Vanilli, the 80's pop duo who faked their way to stardom
by lip-syncing songs recorded for them by other people. The idea of
the heroic individual now having devolved into mere celebrityhood,
modern magazines and television make people famous simply for
having had their pictures taken. Talent isn't necessarily an issue.
</P>
<P>
   The downward historical trajectory goes from William Faulkner's
notion of fame (''to be, as a private individual, abolished and
voided from history, leaving it markless, no refuse save the
printed books'') to Kato Kaelin. Fame, stripped of its old
spiritual sense of everlasting existence derived from valued
accomplishment, accrues these days to Linda Evangelista and Kate
Moss, who look good in advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, if Byron were around, he'd be sleeping with a model.
</P>

PUMPKIN-COOK AND PUMPKIN-SEEDS) 
 
 
By NATALIE HAUGHTON

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Halloween and pumpkins go hand in hand _ and
there's plenty of good eating in store beyond pumpkin pie.
Possibilities range from soups and butters to breads, pancakes,
stuffings _ even entrees _ pies, desserts and more.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Great Little Pumpkin Cookbook,'' by Michael Krondl
(CelestialArts; $5.95), you'll find interesting innovations, such
as a pumpkin stuffed with layers of chicken, chiles and tortillas
and then baked; or Pumpkin Tamales With Smoky Tomato Salsa; Pumpkin
Stuffed Ravioli With Pumpkin Seed Cream; Savory Italian Rice,
Spinach and Pumpkin Torte; Farfalle With Pumpkin and Pecorino
Cheese; Indian Pumpkin Fritters; Pumpkin Spanakopita; Catalan Pork,
Bean and Pumpkin Stew; Pumpkin Blintzes with Caramelized Ginger;
and a wealth of other creations using the golden orb in one form or
another.
</P>
<P>
   You can cook and puree fresh pumpkin flesh _ which isn't
difficult but takes a little time and patience _ or you can opt for
using canned pumpkin puree _ which may be the best route for busy
cooks.
</P>
<P>
   After experimenting with cooking fresh pumpkin _ which turned
out to be a big hassle _ it's easy to understand why the majority
of cooks rely on convenient canned pumpkin puree or canned pumpkin
pie mix (with sugar and spices in the pumpkin) on supermarket
shelves, ready to use on a moment's notice.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the eating pumpkins grown commercially end up in cans _
some 150,000 tons of them _ notes Krondl in his book. And Libby's
owns about 80 percent of the canned market. In 1929, the company
began its pumpkin processing operations, and the first canned
pumpkin made its way to grocers' shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Don't let me discourage you if you want to try your hand at
cooking fresh.
</P>
<P>
   But if you plan to cook fresh pumpkins, be forewarned. ``Most
large pumpkins are bland and watery and best suited to
jack-o'-lanterns,'' writes Krondl. He recommends using the orange
cooking varieties _ such as sugar or pie pumpkin _ which weigh
about 7 pounds. Or another possibility for cooking fresh is the
cheese pumpkin variety _ which is beige on the outside and has
thick and tasty orange meat.
</P>
<P>
   If you purchase your pumpkin from a grower, ask about the
varieties best for cooking and pureeing. When choosing a pumpkin
for cooking, some growers advise selecting a dark orange one. The
darker the color, generally the more meat or flesh it will have.
Also select pumpkins that are firm and with skins free of cracks,
spots or excessive scars.
</P>
<P>
   Although some varieties may yield better cooked pumpkin results
than others, I've cooked up medium-size (not gigantic or oversized
ones) run-of-the mill Halloween pumpkins (variety unknown)
purchased at the market _ and they've produced good, edible pumpkin
puree. Experiment if you have the time and inclination.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to peel a pumpkin, notes Krondl in his book, is
to cut it in half and scoop out the seeds and stringy pieces. Then
cut into 2- to 3-inch-wide slices and cut away the hard skin. (Some
recipes call for removing the skin after cooking, which is often
easier.) You can store cut-up, uncooked pumpkin up to four days in
the fridge.
</P>
<P>
   If your fresh pumpkin turns out too watery once it's cooked and
pureed, cook it over low heat (to drive off some of the moisture)
until it is the desired consistency, or the consistency of canned
pumpkin. Or place the watery pumpkin in a strainer and allow it to
drain an hour or two, stirring occasionally. And if you end up with
a surplus, remember that pureed pumpkin can be frozen if
well-wrapped.
</P>
<P>
   When you use pumpkin in recipes, figure that 1 pound raw,
uncooked pumpkin will yield about 3/4 to 1 cup of cooked mashed
pumpkin. And when it comes to nutritional value, pumpkin shares
similar food values with other deep yellow winter squash. On cup of
unseasoned pureed pumpkin has about 75 to 80 calories and only a
trace of fat. Pumpkin is also exceptionally high in vitamin A (in
the form of beta-carotene) and is high in dietary fiber.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter whether it comes from your garden, a farm stand or
even a can, whether it's cut out to be a fearsome porch ornament,
an ingredient in exotic stew, or plain old pie, you know it'll
carve a grin on your face. It does on mine,'' writes Krondl.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of good eating in pumpkin _ either fresh or
canned. Clip and save these recipes to use now and throughout the
holiday season. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   I don't believe in ghosts. But standing inside the fallen stone
walls of the ruins of Yapashi, I can almost feel the presence of
the hundreds of souls who once inhabited this abandoned plateau.
Their disappearance left the pueblo _ isolated deep inside the
Bandelier wilderness in northern New Mexico _ one of the loneliest
places on earth.
</P>
<P>
   About the only sound, other than wind blowing through ponderosa
pines in the canyon below, is the ringing of blood rushing through
the vessels in my eardrums, the buzzing of a brain contemplating
the weird feeling of being alive.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway through this millennium, Yapashi teemed with human life
_ a way station, archaeologists believe, for the Anasazi, ancestors
of the Pueblo Indians who now live east of here along the Rio
Grande.
</P>
<P>
   All around where I am walking, people once cooked rabbits, made
pottery, danced to appease their invisible gods. Spirits seem to
hover everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Just beyond the edge of the pueblo, you can still see two stone
mountain lions crouching on the ground, symbols of an old religion
in which everything _ rocks, rivers, mountains, thunder and
lightning _ was aware and alive.
</P>
<P>
   What were these people thinking as they looked out at the
distant mountains and up at the stars? What was it like to see the
world through their eyes?
</P>
<P>
   These questions preoccupy me every time I take the six-mile hike
to Yapashi, up and down the sides of the intervening canyons,
across the pine-covered mesa tops. When I arrive, all that remains
of the ancient ponderings are material clues, bits of inanimate
matter carefully shaped by conscious minds.
</P>
<P>
   Consciousness _ the undeniable presence at the core of our being
_ may be more a mystery now than it was to the Yapashi. This year
marks the end of what was grandiosely christened the Decade of the
Brain. In the last 10 years, scientists have used new scanning
techniques to see which parts of the brain light up when you listen
to music, read a book or recall a buried memory. They have even
uncovered neuronal circuits involved in mathematical computation.
</P>
<P>
   But all this has only served to deepen the mystery. The brain
indeed appears to be a biological computer. So where in the
neurological wiring is the source of consciousness? How does a
three-pound glob of cerebral flesh exude thoughts and know that it
is alive?
</P>
<P>
   At the edge of a kiva, an underground ceremonial chamber whose
rock walls collapsed long ago, I spot a broken shard of
white-glazed pottery deliberately emblazoned with precise black
lines. Turning it over with my fingers, I marvel at the pleasing
geometric pattern.
</P>
<P>
   What made the potter decide to use this particular design? So
little is known about the people of Yapashi or the meaning of their
markings, but staring at the potsherd you immediately feel a sense
of kinship, a connection across the centuries with a mind at play _
the existence long ago of a contemplative individual. A self.
</P>
<P>
   The potter's artistic inventiveness would seem, on the surface,
to confer no real advantage in the Darwinian struggle for survival.
Learning to make vessels to store food and carry water would give a
tribe an edge in the game of life.
</P>
<P>
   But why expend the energy to decorate them? And what use was
served by the spirals and zigzags the Anasazi carved into the sides
of the volcanic cliffs throughout this region? What is it that
drives us _ both ancient artists and modern scientists _ to dwell
so intently on the abstract rhythms called patterns?
</P>
<P>
   Turning my head eastward, I can barely see on the horizon a
radio telescope pointing its white steel dish at the sky, a
reminder that this isolated world is only a few miles from Los
Alamos National Laboratory, where cosmology and theoretical physics
are now pursued as avidly as weapons research.
</P>
<P>
   From etching patterns on rocks, people have gone to
contemplating patterns in the sky and in the particles that make up
the universe. But the patterns that fascinate us most are the ones
inside our heads, in the land of the inner self.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout much of the century, speculating about the nature of
consciousness was a sure way for a scientist to be labeled an
eccentric or a crank. But as the picture we've drawn of the
universe becomes more and more refined, this vacuum in our
understanding only looms larger, begging to be filled.
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-1990s, psychologists, philosophers,
neuroscientists, physicists, mathematicians and other academics
have flocked to interdisciplinary jamborees with titles like
``Toward a Science of Consciousness,'' and have issued one book
after another laying out their conflicting visions.
</P>
<P>
   On one side are materialists of various stripes, sure that the
inner light can, like everything else, be explained scientifically
_ in terms of matter, energy and information. On the other side are
the ``New Mysterians,'' named by their opponents in honor of the
1960s rock band Question Mark and the Mysterians. They believe that
consciousness is so far outside the domain of conventional science
that it may be the one pattern we never understand.
</P>
<P>
   For those who hope that, in time, science will answer every
question, the rallying cry of the materialists is reassuring: The
mind is what the brain does. As the trillion brain cells called
neurons communicate with electrochemical signals, intelligence,
awareness and all the mysterious inner feelings emerge like a
simulation run on a biological computer.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Astonishing Hypothesis,'' Francis Crick, co-discoverer
of the double-helical structure of DNA, starkly described this
view: ``'You,' your joys and your sorrows, your memories and your
ambitions, your sense of personal identity and free will, are in
fact no more than the behavior of a vast assembly of nerve cells
and their associated molecules.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, to many neuroscientists, there is nothing astonishing
about the hypothesis at all. Explaining consciousness, they assume,
will turn out to be no more of a philosophical problem than
explaining life _ as interlocking whorls of chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   What really would floor them would be to find that the mind
could not be entirely explained in terms of neuronal circuitry.
</P>
<P>
   It is not too difficult to imagine how billions of brain cells
trading signals process the information people need to survive.
There are circuits for detecting patterns in the light that falls
on the retina, circuits for teasing the phonemes of language from
vibrations of sound. From this information the brain builds models
of the world.
</P>
<P>
   So why not models of one's own behavior? Could this crude sense
of self-awareness be what we mean by consciousness?
</P>
<P>
   In his tour de force, ''Consciousness Explained,'' the
philosopher Daniel Dennett showed how neuronal machinery might even
give rise to the stream of consciousness, the inner voice that
plays constantly in our heads. The brain, in this view, is a
sense-making machine, engaged in a constant internal debate.
</P>
<P>
   Is that a herd of elk grazing over in the valley, or a cluster
of pinyon trees? And over there: is that a huge snowcapped mountain
or a low-hanging cumulus cloud?
</P>
<P>
   In Dennett's theory, competing teams of neurons silently weigh
and discard the possibilities: It can't be a mountain because the
whole thing just moved.
</P>
<P>
   From the pandemonium, bubbling just below the surface of
awareness, a single narrative emerges _ the voice of the inner
``I'' conducting its running story about what seems to be going on
in the world. Consciousness, then, is a tale-spinning computer,
what Dennett calls ``the Joycean machine.''
</P>
<P>
   The implication is that there is no reason a properly programmed
digital computer couldn't be made equally aware. And that is where
Dennett's opponents rise up with their objections.
</P>
<P>
   One can imagine a robot that is aware of its surroundings and
even aware of its place in its surroundings. But could these
rudimentary cogitations ever be accompanied by the profound feeling
of inhabiting vast mental spaces?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the robot could operate perfectly well without
agonizing and enthralling over its own existence. But so, it seems,
could we. Philosophers call this ``the zombie problem.''
</P>
<P>
   If the point of life were simple survival, creatures could
conceivably have evolved that performed all the functions people do
_ building houses, villages, civilizations _ but without the
sensation of being alive. What purpose does the feeling of
consciousness, of inner experience, really serve?
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1970s, the psychologist Julian Jaynes created a
sensation with his intimidatingly titled book, ``The Origin of
Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind.'' People, he
declared, indeed used to be zombies, with no more feeling of I-ness
than the living dead. For centuries they were steered through life
by persistent inner voices, as controlling circuits in the right
side of the brain sent signals to the left side.
</P>
<P>
   Modern people experience these thoughts as the sound of the
inner self. But in the beginning, Jaynes says, they were
interpreted as the voices of gods. ``There were no private
ambitions, no private grudges, no private frustrations, no private
anything,'' Jaynes wrote. As the world grew more complicated, this
``bicameral mind'' broke down. The two sides of the brain became
more closely intertwined and consciousness, the sense of being a
self, was born. The spirits were replaced by the ego, the I.
</P>
<P>
   From studying ancient texts like the ``Iliad'' and the
``Odyssey,'' Jaynes concluded that in Europe and Asia consciousness
arose around 3,000 years ago. When the Asiatic tribes believed to
be the ancestors of all Native Americans crossed the Bering land
bridge at least 12,000 years ago, could they still have been
Jaynesian robots haunted by inner voices?
</P>
<P>
   Had consciousness dawned by the late 13th century when the
Anasazi abandoned their empire on the Colorado Plateau, dispersing
to places like Yapashi, and eventually settling in the pueblos
along the Rio Grande?
</P>
<P>
   We have no way of knowing. Science can study the signs of
self-awareness: drawings on rock walls and pottery, written words,
facial expressions. But the only consciousness anyone has access to
is the private world inside oneself. In trying to map this unique
geography, the scientific method of separating subject and object
breaks down. The subject is the object, and in thinking about
thinking we get caught in dizzying regresses of introspection.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder archaeologists have habitually regarded ancient
peoples as automatons, moved around like pawns by geographical
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Why did the southwest pueblo cultures so often build on mesa
tops, like Yapashi, when the source of water and the best farmland
was down below on the canyon floors? The common textbook
explanation is that the villagers were defending themselves against
enemies. But maybe they were just enjoying the view.
</P>
<P>
   One can always find a reductive answer. When the Anasazi
scratched their patterns on the rocks, maybe they were just
instinctively marking territory like ancient gangs. Even the
curiosity that drives modern astronomers to explore the night sky
could be no more than an outgrowth of the primitive need to watch
for invaders.
</P>
<P>
   It all seems so logical, and so unsatisfying. I pick up a shard
of glassy black obsidian, wondering if it's a flake left by the
maker of an arrowhead or by the insentient weathering of nature. My
visual sensors register black and shiny. My tactile sensors
register the sharpness of the edge. But I also experience the
feeling, both subtle and intense, of seeing and holding the rock:
the sharpness of the sharp, the blackness of the black.
</P>
<P>
   The immediacy of subjective experience is so overwhelming that
the New Mysterians believe conventional science will never explain
it. Their predecessors, the Old Mysterians, were dualists, who saw
mind as a spiritual essence separate from matter. Members of the
new wave assume that consciousness is a natural feature of brain
matter.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, as Colin McGinn argues in his new book, ``The
Mysterious Flame,'' is that people simply haven't evolved enough to
understand it, and probably never will. The most provocative of
these skeptics, David Chalmers, offers a strange kind of hope: he
believes that the impenetrability of consciousness is a clue that
science needs to start over again from scratch and carve up the
world in a whole new way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The physical structure of the world _ the exact distribution
of particles, fields and forces in space-time _ is logically
consistent with the absence of consciousness,'' he recently wrote,
``so the presence of consciousness is a further fact about our
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Science has been treating consciousness as something secondary,
to be explained in terms of existing concepts. Chalmers believes it
will be necessary to admit consciousness into science as an
irreducible thing-in-itself, along with matter, energy, space and
time. Then perhaps we will truly understand the universe.
</P>
<P>
   It seems absurd to think that this newfound quality would happen
to reside only in human heads. So Chalmers has joined a handful of
philosophers who reluctantly entertain the possibility that what we
call consciousness might somehow pervade the material world.
</P>
<P>
   This notion, panpsychism (``mind everywhere''), is not so
different from what the Anasazi believed _ that everything is full
of spirits. And so we return, full circle, to the philosophy of
Yapashi.
</P>
<P>
   The idea seems crazy. But so, a century ago, did the notion that
a lump of seemingly inert matter holds vast amounts of energy _ the
discovery that put Los Alamos on the map and almost erased
Hiroshima.
</P>
<P>
   The modern Pueblo Indians, who trace their ancestry to Yapashi
and other nearby ruins, teach that northern New Mexico is the
center of the universe. Four sacred mountains, one for each
direction, mark the boundaries of this mythological world. But the
cosmologists, at Los Alamos and elsewhere, say there is no center.
The universe, as Freeman Dyson put it, is infinite in all
directions.
</P>
<P>
   As I look one last time at the mountainous panorama, it's easy
to understand the pueblo view. The center is right here where I am
standing, at the focus of my awareness. In trying to make sense of
the world, we fight to overcome such parochial feelings.
</P>
<P>
   But future archaeologists _ if they are able to decipher the
scratchings we leave in our books and on our computer disks _ will
probably understand, and maybe even improve upon our confusion.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Though the Crusaders committed atrocities in the name of Christ,
the idea of crusading remains profoundly and paradoxically
acceptable to the Western mind. The word ``crusade'' is used to
describe campaigns against injustice and poverty; a journalist who
bravely uncovers a salutary truth is described as ``crusading.''
</P>
<P>
   That we so readily invoke the Crusades testifies to the
importance of that era in European history. With the Crusades, the
West found its soul. It began cultivating its own literary,
artistic and spiritual traditions.
</P>
<P>
   This was the age of St. Francis of Assisi, Giotto, Dante and the
troubadours. Until the Crusades, Europe had been a primitive
backwater, isolated from other civilizations and lost in a dark age
that had descended on Western Christendom after the collapse of the
Roman Empire in the fifth century.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the crusading venture, Europe had not only
recovered but also was on a course to overtake its rivals and
achieve world hegemony. This recovery was a triumph unparalleled in
history, but it was also a triumph that involved great strain and
whose unfortunate consequences reverberate even today.
</P>
<P>
   When Pope Urban II summoned the knights of Europe to take part
in the First Crusade in November 1095, he could not have imagined
the enduring effects of his enterprise. The Pope hoped that a
crusade would bring peace to war-torn Europe and enhance the power
of the Western Church.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of fighting one another in pointless feudal wars, the
Pope believed, the knights should join forces, go to the aid of the
Greek Orthodox Christians of Byzantium, liberate territory in
Anatolia recently conquered by the Islamic Turks and, finally,
march to Jerusalem to rescue Christ's tomb from the infidels.
</P>
<P>
   The Pope envisioned a conventional military campaign but found
to his astonishment that he had launched a mass movement. Within
months, hordes of men, women, children, priests, peasants, foot
soldiers and knights set off on the perilous journey across Europe,
drawn by the lure of the Holy City.
</P>
<P>
   When the first of these armies approached Constantinople, it
seemed to the appalled Byzantines, who had long regarded Western
Christians as illiterate thugs, like a new barbarian invasion.
``The whole West,'' wrote Princess Anna Comnena, sister of the
Byzantine emperor, ``was bursting forth into Asia in a solid mass,
with all its possessions.''
</P>
<P>
   This Crusade was the first cooperative act of the new Europe as
it struggled back onto the international scene. For the next 200
years, crusading became the major political passion of the West.
</P>
<P>
   Long before the rise of nationalism, thousands of men and women
from different countries and all classes of society marched 3,000
miles to defend the Holy Land, which they considered to be their
shared patria. These soldiers of Christ established European
colonies in the Middle East and began to dream of world domination.
</P>
<P>
   But Crusading was expensive and dangerous. In the early
campaigns, most Crusaders died, victims of starvation and disease
on the journey. Many survivors returned penniless, for knights
often mortgaged their lands at home in order to equip their armies.
</P>
<P>
   Crusading's rewards were always more spiritual than financial;
it was a genuine religious passion. Crusaders sewed crosses to
their clothes and believed that they were literally following in
Jesus' footsteps in the land where he had lived and carried his
cross to his death. They regarded their Crusade as an act of the
love of God.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that Crusading did not have its dark side as
well. One of the first armies to leave Germany for Jerusalem
attacked all of the Jewish communities along the Rhine Valley in
1096, the first of many pogroms inspired by the Crusades. To these
Christian soldiers it seemed absurd to march 3,000 miles to fight
Muslims when the people who had actually killed Christ (or so the
Crusaders believed) were alive and well on their very doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   As Western Christians invented a new identity for themselves,
Jews became the demonic ``other.'' The ``blood libel'' _ the belief
that Jews used the blood of Christian children to make matzoh at
Passover _ first surfaced in England in 1191, when Richard
Lion-Heart took the cross and prepared to lead the Third Crusade.
</P>
<P>
   The image of the Jew as the child-slayer revealed an almost
Oedipal Christian fear of the parent faith. When Hitler started his
modern crusade against European Jewry, the ground had been prepared
by a millennium of Christian anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   Crusading also made Islam the ideological enemy of the West.
When the first Crusaders captured Jerusalem in July 1099, they
slaughtered some 30,000 of the city's Jewish and Muslim inhabitants
in two days. At the Haram al-Sharif, the third holiest place in the
Islamic world, an exultant witness reported that the blood reached
the horses' knees.
</P>
<P>
   The massacre shocked many Europeans, but within a few years
scholarly monks began describing Muslims as a ``savage race ... fit
only for extermination.'' Like Jews, Muslims became the shadow self
of the new Europe, a projection of the buried fears and worries
that the Christians had regarding their own identity and behavior.
</P>
<P>
   There was, however, a residual unease. When the Muslim ruler
Saladin recaptured Jerusalem and restored the Holy City to Islam in
1187 without shedding a single drop of blood, he was depicted in
European folklore as having been secretly baptized. This was,
perhaps, a tacit acknowledgment that Saladin's conduct in victory
had been far more ``Christian'' than that of the Crusaders in 1099.
</P>
<P>
   The Crusades also permanently damaged relations with the Greek
Orthodox Church. Western Christians had long resented what they
perceived as a superior attitude on the part of the Eastern
Christians.
</P>
<P>
   That many Crusaders hated their Orthodox brethren more than the
Muslims was made disgracefully evident in 1204, when the Fourth
Crusade abandoned its assault on the Islamic world and turned its
venom instead on the Christian city of Constantinople _ an attack
the Eastern Christians have never forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   The hostility between the two churches is particularly evident
in the history of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, in Jerusalem.
For centuries, Eastern and Western clergy have fought over control
of the church, which was built by 12th-century Crusaders.
</P>
<P>
   In the 17th century, tensions escalated to the point where the
Ottoman Turks, who governed Jerusalem at the time, had to entrust
the church key to a Muslim family because the Western Christians
and the Orthodox kept locking each other out. Even today this
Muslim family still holds the keys, seeing to it that each sect
gets control of the church for a few hours every day.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their violence and destructiveness, the Crusades helped
to shape some of the more positive enthusiasms of the Age of Faith.
Many of the stories and legends of the courtly-love tradition _
along with the peculiar Western conception of romantic love as a
hopelessly unhappy happiness _ grew out of the Crusades.
</P>
<P>
   Both were inspired by the love of distant objects: a remote lady
and a far-off land. Eleanor of Aquitaine, the great patron of the
troubadours, was herself a Crusader, accompanying her husband,
Louis VII of France, on the Second Crusade in 1146 and carrying on
an intrigue with her handsome young uncle, Raymond, prince of
Antioch.
</P>
<P>
   One of Eleanor's proteges in Europe was Chretien de Troyes, who
spiritualized the old Crusading ideal. Rather than conquer the
cities of the Holy Land, his knights roamed the world, seeking an
ever-elusive spiritual ideal.
</P>
<P>
   Crusading also helped the poverty-stricken to articulate their
grievances against the rich. During the First Crusade, poor
noncombatants played a crucial role and made the monastic ideal of
``holy poverty'' central to Crusading.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars now believe that the Children's Crusade of 1212 may in
fact have been a huge demonstration of the poor and destitute
people of France and Germany, who were often contemptuously
referred to as pueri (``children''). They marched through towns and
villages, carrying large wooden crosses and declaring that it was
they, not the rich, who followed in the footsteps of the poor and
suffering Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Their calls for the inauguration of a New Jerusalem, a society
that was truly in accord with the compassionate and egalitarian
ideal put forth in the Gospels, continued long after the Crusades
had ended.
</P>
<P>
   While the Crusaders failed to permanently recapture the Holy
Land, they gained much from their encounter with the Islamic world.
In the lands the Crusaders had taken, the local Arabs civilized the
European settlers: They taught them to take baths and to accord
greater rights to women.
</P>
<P>
   The Arabs also taught the Crusaders how to process sugar from
the cane, and provided European merchants with a vast array of
luxury goods to ship home: silk, linen, flax, samite (a heavy silk
fabric), balm and the dye Tyrian purple.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Arabic words introduced into English at this time
attests to the extent of this cross-cultural pollination:
``orange,'' ``lemon,'' ``alfalfa,'' ``cube,'' ``alchemy,''
''alkali,'' ``algebra,'' ``alembic,'' ``amalgam,'' ``tariff,''
``soda,'' ''admiral,'' ``checkmate.''
</P>
<P>
   Without a doubt, the Crusades contributed to the richness of
Western civilization. It is their tragic legacy, though, that is
felt most keenly today, particularly in the Middle East. It was,
after all, the murderous anti-Semitism of Europe, first unleashed
by the Crusaders, that made the State of Israel a necessary haven
for the Jewish people.
</P>
<P>
   It was also the ferocity of the Crusader attacks that shaped for
Muslims of the region a lasting impression of persistent Western
aggression. Indeed, nearly a millennium after Urban II's rallying
cry, some Muslim fundamentalists still call Western imperialism and
Western Christianity by the same name: al-Salibiyyah _ ``the
Crusade.''

</P>
<P>
   Love in the Western world _ to borrow Denis de Rougemont's
useful term _ has come to mean, in the popular imagination,
romantic love almost exclusively.
</P>
<P>
   Pure emotion, passion, ``love at first sight'' _ we so take for
granted the import of romantic love, it may come as a surprise to
learn that the very concept of ``love'' based upon emotion as a
high value, and not as an outlaw passion, is relatively new in the
history of mankind.
</P>
<P>
   Romantic love isn't so much a love that defies conventions, for
romantic love is of all love types the most conventional, as a love
that arises with seeming spontaneity: unwilled, undirected by
others' suggestions or admonitions, raw and unpremeditated and of
the heart; not cerebral and not genital.
</P>
<P>
   Romantic love is forever in opposition to formal, cultural and
tribal prescriptions of behavior: arranged marriages, for instance,
in which brides and their dowries are possessions to be handed over
to a bridegroom and his family, or in which titled names are wed in
businesslike arrangements that have little to do with the feelings
of individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably the most celebrated of late-20th-century public
figures, Diana, princess of Wales, would seem to have been a martyr
to such an arrangement; her political marriage to Prince Charles
ending in dissolution and divorce, and her ``quest for personal
happiness'' (i.e., romantic love) ending in a grotesquely public
death on a Parisian boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   In the ancient world, romantic love would seem to have been
virtually unknown, and rarely celebrated. Our generic term ``love''
didn't exist. The sentiment of romantic love as we know it was the
homoerotic love of older Greek men for boys. Marital love, which
surely existed, seems oddly not to have been much honored, at least
in surviving literature.
</P>
<P>
   Plato's elaborately extended metaphor of the republic, or the
perfectly balanced state, discusses marriage primarily as mating;
by contrast, Plato's ``Symposium'' celebrates homoerotic love in
the most blushingly romantic terms.
</P>
<P>
   How different this is from the extramarital erotic attraction of
heterosexuals, which results in devastation and violent death. In
Euripides' ``Hippolytus,'' for instance, the young Queen Phaedra
falls in love with her husband's illegitimate son, who rejects her,
and causes her to commit suicide. Phaedra is no romantic, but
rather the victim of an ungovernable, unwished-for passion imposed
upon her by Aphrodite. Such sexual desire is akin to a curse.
</P>
<P>
   Where to the classical mind the intervention of eros in human
affairs signals chaos, disaster and retribution, to the more
modern, romantically inclined sensibility, eros is the very engine
of life's story, a seemingly inexhaustible fund of fantasies of
(mostly heterosexual) desire.
</P>
<P>
   The adulterous tale of Sir Launcelot and Queen Guinevere, the
wife of King Arthur, in Sir Thomas Malory's ``Morte d'Arthur''
strikes a startlingly contemporary note, though written in 1469;
the illicit romances of Hiloose and Abilard, Tristram and Isolde
and other medieval lovers concentrate upon an intensity of genuine
feeling not found in earlier literature.
</P>
<P>
   By the 14th and 15th centuries, in aristocratic European
societies at least, eros had become a fine art, worthy of a
courtier's fullest attention. Not coarse sexuality, but a refined
gentilesse is the ideal of these romances; the love of the courtier
for his lady, usually another man's wife, has been interpreted as a
secularization of the medieval cult of the Virgin Mary, a
``feminization'' of the patriarchal Roman Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   These tales are inevitably from the male perspective. The lady
is saintly, and of an unearthly beauty. Or, in later refinements,
the lady is cruel, even diabolical, and the courtier's passion
becomes his punishment.
</P>
<P>
   In subsequent centuries in the West, romantic love has triumphed
as a sort of private, personal mystique linked with a high cultural
value.
</P>
<P>
   The quintessential romantic-minded heroine is Flaubert's Emma
Bovary, a finely drawn portrait of a woman doomed to unhappiness in
love. Emma is corrupted not by any actual man but by her reading.
She yearns to locate, in the world, the elusive image of romantic
passion. The problem with such yearning, Flaubert suggests, is that
it invariably leads to disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   At least one major American novelist, F. Scott Fitzgerald, wrote
of virtually nothing except romantic love (and its unforeseen
consequences), and it might be argued that writers as diverse as
Carson McCullers and Jack Kerouac are essentially celebrants of
homoerotic romance.
</P>
<P>
   John Updike, our intrepid explorer of love's willful illusions,
would seem an American heir of Proust in both the poetic precision
of his style and his fascination with erotic infatuation. Updike's
preoccupations bring to mind a question of de Rougemont: ``Without
adultery, what would happen to imaginative writing?''
</P>
<P>
   Coming of age in America for most of us has to do with falling
under the spell of the culture's seductive promises about love. To
grow up in the '50s, as I did, was to be bombarded with images of
every kind of romantic-love idea. Advertisements presented
unfailingly pretty, feminine girl-women in various stages of bliss,
always male-related; Hollywood movies dramatized the predominant _
possibly for women the only _ story of significance, the love
story.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from these images of individuals fulfilled by romance,
there were few others, and none as glamorous. (What images of the
intellectual life, for instance? The artistic life?) Of course,
these are cliches, and yet _ what power cliches possess when we're
young and vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Romance'' for me somehow became disembodied from any
particular figure or icon and attached itself to the quest for
adventure, the wild exploration itself. Luckily for me, I can't be
disappointed in this ``romance'' precisely because it's purely
abstract and imaginative.
</P>
<P>
   Romantic love, that most precarious and gossamer of emotions,
will surely survive the millennia that gave birth to it as long as
a reasonably affluent civilization endures, for the secret of
romantic love is economic. It's a luxury only some can afford, just
as a refined taste in food is a consequence of a plentiful food
supply. Is romantic love illusion? Delusion? An ideal dream?
</P>
<P>
   Just as the majority of humankind will continue to believe in
gods of various denominations when no actual gods have been
sighted, so men and women will continue to fall under the spell of
romantic love and to shape, or misshape, their lives to that end.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists may grimly describe for us the mammalian
underpinnings of courtship, mating, bonding, fidelity (where there
is in fact fidelity) _ but, being human, knowing full well as the
song warns us that ``falling in love with love is falling for
make-believe,'' we are the species that demands to be lied to, in
the nicest ways.

CENTRAL: RUNNING OF ALL BUT BULLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Welcome to the NBA's Black-and-Blue Division.
</P>
<P>
   Throw out the fraudulent Chicago Bulls _ are they something or
what? _ and you have the best-balanced division in the league. With
the exception of the disreputaBulls, you have seven teams with
quite legitimate playoff aspirations. Given what's going on in the
Atlantic Division, who could say otherwise?
</P>
<P>
   The Central Division features a worst-to-first turnaround by the
Hornets, who last year were predicted to finish even lower than the
Bulls. The reason? Their two best players were out, their coach was
in a snit, and their marquee free agent was Derrick Coleman. But
the Hornets changed coaches, made a big deal (which looks better
every day), and now are the presumptive favorites in the division.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's champ, Indiana, has a spectacular new building and a
real tug-of-war going on between the win-it-now crowd (Larry Bird)
and the let's-reload-before-we-become-the-Bulls crowd (management).
One Davis has been traded (Antonio) and the other is upset over his
contract (Dale). The backcourt starters are both 34 and the center
has feet that would make Bill Walton blush.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto, meanwhile, is perceived to be a team on the move, and
for good reason. If they ever get a point guard, or if Alvin
Williams somehow morphs into one, the Raptors will be even better.
</P>
<P>
   You can throw a blanket over Milwaukee, Atlanta, Detroit, and
Cleveland. One doesn't appear to be demonstrably better than the
others, although the Pistons still have Grant Hill (for the time
being, anyway). The Bucks seem to have suffered the least of the
four, so they get the early nod to lead the pack. The Cavs have a
rookie coach, but also have Danny Ferry on the last year of his
10-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   The only team without a chance is, of course, those cagey Bulls.
Gee, they're doing a masterful rebuilding job there, aren't they?
They missed out on all the free agents last summer _ oops, we
forgot Will Perdue and B.J. Armstrong _ so now management is trying
to brainwash the dupes out there into thinking that they'll get
Hill or Tim Duncan next summer. Yeah, sure. Maybe Tyrone Hill.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, they'll be awful again, further discrediting
what they did earlier in the decade. At least the Celtics tried to
be decent (with the notable exception of 1995-96). The Bulls'
``Refuse To Win'' mentality couldn't be more transparent.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a preview of the division, with the teams listed in
projected order of finish.
</P>
<P>
   1. CHARLOTTE HORNETS &QC; 
-- Last season: 26-24, fifth place. Did not make playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   -- Key additions: Baron Davis, Todd Fuller.
</P>
<P>
   -- Key losses: Chucky Brown, Chuck Person.
</P>
<P>
   -- Key returnee: Anthony Mason.
</P>
<P>
   -- Team song: ``Even It Up.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Comment: You gotta like this team on paper. Coach Paul Silas
already had a good team, and then he lucked into rocket man Davis
in the draft. The Hornets can go big or small and beat you either
way. Say what you want about phlegmatic Elden Campbell _ and there
are times when he's out in the ether _ he remains one of the top
three healthy centers in the conference. Coleman appears to have
gotten religion, and Mason, quirks aside, is relentless. Eddie
Jones is one of the top 2 guards in either conference; he'll get a
chance this season to pick up those playoff stats, which have been
a downer. David Wesley may be keeping the seat warm for Davis, but
he's not a bad guy to have running the show. Plus, he can keep
defenses honest with his shooting. The Hornets can also be a pain
on defense with Jones and Davis on the perimeter and Campbell and
Coleman to block shots. Everyone likes this team now. It's easy to
see why.
</P>
<P>
   2. INDIANA PACERS &QC; 
-- Last season: 33-17, first place. Lost to New York in the
conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   -- Key additions: Jonathan Bender, Zan Tabak.
</P>
<P>
   -- Key losses: Antonio Davis, Fred Hoiberg.
</P>
<P>
   -- Key lame duck: Larry Bird.
</P>
<P>
   -- Team song: ``I Don't Want to Wait.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Comment: How much do these guys have left in the tank? Bird
is on record as saying not only that this is his last year, but
also that he can't go into the season without a decent backup for
Rik Smits. So he has Zan Tabak? The Pacers can go two ways, either
one understandable. They can recognize this might be their last,
best chance, or they can do what they did three years ago when they
knew Larry Brown wasn't coming back. They took that year off. The
loss of Davis is significant in the short run; three years from
now, if Bender develops as many think he might, we might be hailing
it as an outright Indy theft. But that's not going to help the
Pacers now, unless the kid is even savvier than Kevin Garnett.
Antonio Davis was a huge force (even if he did get smoked by Marcus
Camby in the playoffs), and now Dale Davis is in high dudgeon over
his contract. If they play, and play hard, the window is still
open. But barely.
</P>
<P>
   3. TORONTO RAPTORS &QC; 
-- Last season: 23-27, sixth place. Did not make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   -- Key additions: Antonio Davis, Muggsy Bogues, Dell Curry, Alex
Radojevic.
</P>
<P>
   -- Key losses: John Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   -- Team song: ``It's Getting Hotter in the North.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Comment: These guys have the pieces in place to make a
serious upgrade and don't seem all that much less powerful _ on
paper _ than either of the two teams above them. They've got
grizzled tough guys (Davis, Kevin Willis, Charles Oakley) to go
along with dazzling young'uns (Tracy McGrady, Vince Carter) and
assorted others who can shoot (Curry), block shots (Michael
Stewart), and defend (Doug Christie). The big question mark is at
point guard; is Williams up to it or will the no-knees-left Bogues
be pressed into serious service? Toronto wanted to plug that hole
this past summer and made a run at Eric Snow. The Raptors still
have some very moveable players if they feel they have to make a
deal down the road. But with a very acceptable starting five and
some enviable depth _ we haven't even mentioned Dee Brown, who is
on the shelf for now _ the Raptors should become the first Canadian
playoff team in NBA history.

<P>
   4. MILWAUKEE BUCKS &QC; 
-- Last season: 28-22, fourth place. Lost to Indiana in first
round.
</P>
<P>
   -- Key additions: Dale Ellis, J.R. Reid, Danny Manning.
</P>
<P>
   -- Key losses: Dell Curry, Michael Curry.
</P>
<P>
   -- Team song: ``Easy to Be Hard.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Comment: Only five players remain from the Bucks team that
started the season last February: Ray Allen, Glenn Robinson, Ervin
Johnson, Tractor Traylor, and Vinny Del Negro. But even bigger is
the availability of Sam Cassell, who was all but gonzo last year.
If he's healthy and stays healthy, he can be a big plus. George
Karl's teams also play defense _ a previously foreign concept to
the Big Dog _ and the presence of all those veterans can't hurt in
the locker room. (Ellis, of course, played for Karl in Seattle.) A
real wild card here for Milwaukee is Tim Thomas, who came over from
Philadelphia. If he develops as Karl thinks he might, he could be a
terrific addition off the bench. Traylor and Reid will provide bulk
up front, and Johnson can block shots, if not much else. The big
question is how much of a hit the Bucks took in losing the Currys.
Ellis might replace Dell. But Michael's toughness won't be easy to
replicate.
</P>
<P>
   5. ATLANTA HAWKS &QC; 
-- Last season: 31-19, second place. Lost to New York in the second
round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   -- Key additions: Isaiah Rider, Jim Jackson, Lorenzen Wright,
Bimbo Coles, Jason Terry, Cal Bowdler.
</P>
<P>
   -- Key losses: Steve Smith, Mookie Blaylock, Tyrone Corbin,
Grant Long, Ed Gray.
</P>
<P>
   -- Team song: ``I Know There's an Answer Here.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Comment: This team could have gotten to the conference finals
last spring had it remained healthy and been able to make shots. It
did neither and succumbed to the Knicks in utterly humiliating
fashion. Still, the breakup is staggering and a lot is riding on
the new guys. Rider is who he is; this also is the last year of his
contract. Wright is a nice addition up front, but is Bimbo Coles an
even swap for Blaylock? (Terry eventually may settle there when he
figures out how the NBA works.) There are also a lot of questions
about Lenny Wilkens's ability to handle all the potential
distractions _ we've already seen Rider acting up (it's a good
thing he wasn't in Kitty Hawk or we'd still be taking trains). But
the Hawks like the mix (forget what you saw in Providence if you
were one of the 100 who watched). And while we're at it, isn't it
time Dikembe Mutombo puts an end to his ``overrated'' tag?
</P>
<P>
   6. DETROIT PISTONS &QC; 
-- Last season: 29-21, third place. Lost to Atlanta in the first
round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   -- Key additions: Terry Mills, Michael Curry.
</P>
<P>
   -- Key losses: Joe Dumars.
</P>
<P>
   -- Key maybes: Bison Dele, Derek Harper.
</P>
<P>
   -- Team song: ``The Last Time.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Comment: A lot hinges on whether Dele and Harper decide to
play. If they do, the Pistons could be back in third place. If they
don't, they'll be lucky to make the playoffs. They have the best
ACC team right now _ a notch above Wake Forest _ but they can't be
serious about Eric Montross/Don Reid with Christian Laettner at
power forward. They have the supernova in Hill, who may use this
season to determine if he really wants to stay or join Tim Duncan
in San Antonio. (Wouldn't that be a nice fit, given the Spurs' need
for a small forward?) Harper would help in the locker room _ we
think _ and provide a capable backup to erratic Lindsey Hunter.
They have some good outside shooters in Jud Buechler and Terry
Mills, a super slasher in Jerry Stackhouse (who has to start
playing one of these days), and the relentless Jerome Williams.
That should be enough to get them to the dance.
</P>
<P>
   7. CLEVELAND CAVALIERS &QC; 
-- Last season: 22-28, seventh place. Did not make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   -- Key additions: Lamond Murray, Mark Bryant, Andre Miller,
Trajan Langdon.
</P>
<P>
   -- Key losses: Derek Anderson, Johnny Newman.
</P>
<P>
   -- Team song: ``Nobody Home.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Comment: These guys could be a lot better this season and
still find themselves right where they were last year. They have a
new coach in Randy Wittman and they also have a lot riding on the
Waltonesque feet of Zydrunas Ilgauskas. If he can play this season,
and play the way the Cavs know he can play, then Cleveland will be
a potentially dangerous team. (Bryant was picked up as insurance,
although he's no Andrew DeClercq.) They will have the inside game
and the outside game with bombers galore in Wesley Person, Murray,
and Langdon. That's a good mix. The Cavs were generally pretty
sound defensively under Mike Fratello, and it's hard to envision
that changing with a Bobby Knight disciple at the helm. This could
easily be the best seventh-place team in the league. If the Z man
avoids the IL and the rookies develop as hoped, the Cavs could move
up a notch or two.
</P>
<P>
   8. CHICAGO BULLS &QC; 
-- Last season: 13-37, last place. Did not make playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   -- Key additions: Elton Brand, Ron Artest, Will Perdue, B.J.
Armstrong, Hersey Hawkins, Fred Hoiberg.
</P>
<P>
   -- Key losses: Ron Harper, Brent Barry, Mark Bryant, Andrew
Lang, Bill Wennington.
</P>
<P>
   -- Team song: ``The Impostors.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Comment: Well, at least the Jerrys can relax knowing they
have not done what the Celtics did. That, of course, was their big
fear. No, they've turned themselves into the Clippers, which is
even more mystifying. Somehow, the basketball fans in Chicago are
being asked to fork over good money to see a team that again has
decided to take a pass on the season. Oh, we'll see a lot of Brand
and Artest because they have to play; there's no one else. Everyone
else of any consequence is in the last year of his contract,
including the Bulls' last holdover from the Glory Days II, Toni
Kukoc. (Armstrong and Perdue were around for Glory Days I.) Think
those guys will be really pushing the envelope for victory No. 20
in mid-April? The big question is whether the Bulls can outmaneuver
Orlando _ also tanking it _ for the worst overall record. That's
part of the plan, of course. Just ask the Clippers how it all comes
together.

PATRIOTS BEAT DENVER FOR FIRST TIME SINCE '81 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ He was kicked in the shins, and his knee and
ankle were twisted. Ben Coates was hurting.
</P>
<P>
   So why was he smiling?
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you kidding?'' said Coates. ``We beat Denver. I've never
beaten Denver.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots hadn't beaten Denver since Sept. 29, 1980, losing
11 straight games. Sunday's game could have been another loss.
Instead, the Patriots watched as a 24-13 third-quarter lead
evaporated before they hung on for a 24-23 victory before 60,011 at
Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   There was a collective holding of breath when Denver's Jason
Elam attempted a 59-yard field goal with 1:45 remaining. However
the attempt by Elam, who has kicked a 63-yarder, tying the all-time
record, fell short in a gusty and swirling wind. With no timeouts
remaining, the Patriots took over on downs and sealed the victory
to make them 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss te out of 10 times,'' said Elam. ``It was not a
given by any means, so you swing as hard as you can and hope it has
the distance. Those posts don't look very big from back there. I
should have eaten my Wheaties this morning. You just do the best
you can and hope it goes through.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos, who had put together fourth-quarter drives of 85
yards for a touchdown and 59 yards for a field goal to make it
24-23, started their last drive at their 20 with 3:15 left. The
Broncos could have used the retired John Elway and the injured
Terrell Davis. Instead, they had Brian Griese and Olandis Gary.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't quite the same, but the Broncos, who started the
season 0-4 before winning two, started nicely. They were aided by
an interference call on Steve Israel, and Gary broke two tackles on
a 15-yard catch and run gain to the 44.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Milloy made a key stop on Gary for a 4-yard loss, and a
7-yard pass from Griese to Ed McCaffrey, on which the big receiver
went end over end after being hit, got them to the 40. After a
third-down pass to Rod Smith was incomplete, the field goal team
came out.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' offense looked good, with possibly its best
performance of the season. The Patriots ran the ball 28 times for
133 yards, the same amount as Denver with one more carry. They had
28 running plays, and Drew Bledsoe dropped back to pass 26 times.
The offensive line looked like blocks of granite, not limestone, as
for the first time this season a Patriot runner went for more than
100 yards (Terry Allen with 17 carries for 106 yards and two
touchdowns).
</P>
<P>
   ``We just set our minds to running the ball,'' said offensive
coordinator Ernie Zampese. ``We didn't run anything different. The
guys just blocked like crazy. We wanted to make an impact with the
running game. Terry Allen ran like Terry Allen.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen suffered a concussion during a third-quarter drive, giving
rookie Kevin Faulk a chance at the end. Faulk had ripped off a
15-yard touchdown run in the first quarter, his first in the NFL.
On the play, everyone pulled left but Faulk made a quick cut to the
right and was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offensive line did a great job,'' said Allen. ``When they
block like that, it's easy to run the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulk was superb on the return game, too, breaking a 33-yard
kick return and a 20-yard punt return. He had 238 all-purpose
yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went out there trying to compete at 100 percent,'' said
Faulk, who has struggled with an ankle sprain the past month.
``Terry had a great game. He's doing what he's done for the last
nine years, that's running the ball and scoring touchdowns.''
</P>
<P>
   It got tricky in the fourth quarter after the Patriots lost
linebackers Marty Moore (ankle sprain) and Vernon Crawford
(strained knee ligaments), leaving them with two healthy players at
that position. That forced New England to use defensive backs Larry
Whigham and Lawyer Milloy on the weak side until Crawford came
back, although at far less than full strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found ourselves having to figure out what to do after every
single play,'' said defensive coordinator Steve Sidwell. ``We were
trying to coach Larry along. It was a hectic time, but we got it
done. We found a way to cover the things we needed to cover.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots scored a season-high 10 first-quarter points.
Faulk's nifty run capped a six-play, 59-yard drive, which included
a 20-yard pass from Drew Bledsoe (13 for 22, 214 yards) to Coates.
Adam Vinatieri kicked a 28-yard field goal with 2:37 remaining in
the quarter after Lamont Warren tripped at the 10, 3 yards short of
a first down.
</P>
<P>
   Elam hit a 40-yard field goal with 11:11 left in the second
quarter and the Patriots soon lost Moore, forcing them to use
Crawford, normally a strong-side linebacker, on the weak side.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos exploited this immediately when Gary found a massive
hole for a 60-yard gain to the 28. Two plays later, Griese
connected with Smith for a 28-yard touchdown with 7:52 remaining in
the quarter, making it 10-10.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots scored 26 seconds before halftime when Bledsoe
spotted Terry Glenn on a deep route over the middle for a 67-yard
catch. Glenn, who had been shut out until that time, beat safety
Tyrone Braxton and faked Dale Carter with a move to the outside at
midfield. He ran it all the way to the 1, from where Allen got in,
giving the Patriots a 17-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
   On Denver's first possession of the third quarter, Elam capped a
seven-play, 62-yard drive with a 28-yard field goal, but the
Patriots answered. Allen kicked things off on the ensuing drive
with a 39-yard scamper. Later in the drive, Allen ran for 18 before
scoring on a 1-yard rush behind the left side of the Patriots'
line, which got superb push all day.
</P>
<P>
   From there it was a matter of survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we feel we're back on track,'' said cornerback Ty
Law. ``There's one more game before the bye week, and hopefully
we'll be 6-2. After that, we plan on going 8-0.''

CLEMENS FAMILY FELT PAIN AT FENWAY 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For many Red Sox fans, the highlight of the 1999
season was the Saturday afternoon playoff victory over the Yankees
when Roger Clemens was hooted off the mound in the third inning of
a 13-1 Sox win.
</P>
<P>
   There was a lot of gloating in old Fenway that day. Irate that
Clemens dared return to Boston in a Yankee uniform, fans were
estatic when the Sox knocked him out early in his duel with Pedro
Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   The KO itself wasn't enough. Fenway legions chanted, ``Where is
Roger?'' throughout the afternoon, taunting Clemens long after he
was gone. There was some perverse, cruel pleasure in the routing of
the Rocket, as if mere victory was not enough. It was rough on
Debbie Clemens and two of her sons, sitting in Section 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``They treated him like dirt,'' Debbie said Sunday when her
husband was honored as one of the 30 greatest major leaguers of the
20th century. ``It hurt my feelings a lot. It was like all of his
wins there meant nothing. He gave everything he had.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's why they don't ever win in Boston. The fans
have it backward. There is no sportsmanship in that town. It's
mean. It's miserable and mean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at Pedro and I think, there's Roger 10 years ago. And I
know what's going to happen to Pedro in that town. It wasn't like
that here in Atlanta last night. The fans here were great. They
don't have that hatred. I wish they would have better
sportsmanship. It's what you teach your children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I don't know why I should have expected things to
be any different. They did it to Bob Stanley. They were ugly to Jim
Rice. I thought it was sad. I don't know what Roger ever did to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   He won 192 games (tied for first in Boston history with Cy
Young) and three Cy Young Awards while pitching for the Red Sox.
But Boston fans won't forgive him for pitching better in Toronto
than in his final four years in Boston. And joining the Yankees put
Clemens in the Bill Parcells pantheon, another perfect villain for
wise-guy columnists and hate-radio hosts who've never spoken to him
or looked him in the eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was emotional,'' said Debbie. ``I was stunned. Why? What
did he do? They should be yelling at (general manager Dan)
Duquette. They loved Roger, then made him a villain. We went
through that cycle a couple of times.''
</P>
<P>
   Debbie and Roger Clemens spent 13 seasons in Greater Boston and
had all four of their sons while he was playing for the Red Sox.
They owned a house in Framingham and enjoyed a nostalgic foliage
tour along the Massachusetts Turnpike when they came back to
Beantown for the playoffs. But game day provided a rude awakening.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were chanting, `Have another doughnut,' '' said Debbie.
``I still don't get that one. People think he's fat. He's not fat.
Look at him.''
</P>
<P>
   On the fateful Saturday, she sat with sons Koby, 13, and Kory,
11. Koby cried. Kory went to the souvenir stand and ordered pizza.
They left after the fifth. Kory asked his dad if he was OK when he
saw him after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``My oldest guy is a little emotional. I think it's because he
was in Deb's belly during the 1986 World Series,'' said Clemens.
``But my little guy, the lefthander, he couldn't care less. He
knows Dad's all right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those fans just treated me like a visitor. I heard they were
chanting, `Where is Roger?' Well, I was shaving the first time they
did that. That's where I was. And the second time I think I was
signing balls for my teammates. All I know is, I did a lot of great
things there in Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   These are heady days for the Rocket. Sunday he posed for
pictures, sitting between Warren Spahn and Hank Aaron. He joined
Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Ty Cobb, Spahn, Aaron, and 24 others on the
team of the century. And Wednesday night in New York he's scheduled
to pitch the fourth game of the World Series. It will be his first
Series appearance since Mike Greenwell pinch hit for him in the top
of the eighth inning of Game 6 13 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been close to the ring before,'' he said. ``And I'm real
thankful for this opportunity, to have it again. I don't have that
ring on my finger yet, but it's dangling in front of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens's mom, Bess, and his sister, Bonnie, joined Debbie at
Atlanta's Marriott Marquis for the unveiling of baseball's
All-Century Team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look up and I see my face there with Christy Mathewson and I
walk by my mom and give her a high five. I just feel real
fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Ma Clemens was feeling pretty fortunate, too. And it's fortunate
she wasn't in Boston for the Clemens hate-fest nine days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Where is Roger?
</P>
<P>
   He's at the World Series, warming up for Game 4, standing
alongside Nolan Ryan, Sandy Koufax, Bob Gibson, and the other gods
of the game.

KHANNOUCHI SMASHES MARATHON MARK 
</HEADLINE>
 MARATHON-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Khalid Khannouchi was biding his time. At 17 miles,
rival Moses Tanui had blasted from out of nowhere into the lead
pack. Not to worry. By 18, the Kenyan was ahead by 4 seconds; a
mile later the gap was 17 seconds. Still, Khannounchi waited. At 20
miles, Tanui was a formidable 34 seconds ahead and looking toward
an easy victory.
</P>
<P>
   He was just where Khannouchi wanted him, and at mile 22 the
Moroccan took off. The struggling Kenyan was soon looking over his
shoulder at a surging Khannouchi, who improbably caught Tanui with
less than 2 miles to go in Sunday's Chicago Marathon and virtually
sprinted to victory, smashing the world record in 2 hours 5 minutes
42 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally,'' said Khannouchi, 27, ``I have my dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanui, a two-time winner of the Boston Marathon, was second in
2:06:11, the third-fastest time in history and a personal best by 1
minute 22 seconds. Tanui later said he made his move too soon after
unaccountably muddling his conversion of miles into kilometers.
</P>
<P>
   The defending champion, Ondoro Osoro of Kenya, was a distant
third in 2:07:59. American David Morris finished fourth in 2:09:31.
</P>
<P>
   With $100,000 awarded for breaking the world record,
Khannouchi's win was good for $165,000. The previous record,
2:06:05, was set a year ago in Berlin by Ronaldo da Costa of
Brazil, who began Sunday's race but dropped out at mile 15 with
lower back pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my city,'' said an elated Khannouchi after the race,
and he wasn't kidding. In 1997, he won here in 2:07:10, at the time
the fastest marathon debut in the world and the fourth-fastest time
in history. Last year, although crushed by finishing second to
Osoro while battling a stress fracture in his left heel, he
nonetheless ran 2:07:19. Sunday's mark means that Khannouchi, who
has lived in New York for six years and is awaiting US citizenship,
has run three of the fastest 20 marathons in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people that didn't appreciate the job that I did
last year,'' he said. ``It makes me feel bad. I said I will come
back and prove them wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of the race, Khannouchi tucked himself in toward the
back of the lead pack, which went through the halfway point at 1:03
(``Exactly what they wanted,'' said Paul Evans of Great Britain,
one of the pace setters). With him were Osoro, Kenyans Simon Bor,
Joseph Kahugu, and Sammy Korir, and Brazilian Eder Moreno Fialho.
When the pacers stepped aside at mile 17, Osoro was officially but
nominally in the lead of a pack of eight runners that suddenly
included the hard-driving Tanui.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't panic,'' said Khannouchi of the Kenyan's seemingly
effortless move. ``I knew it was too early.'' As a group of
Chicago-area Moroccans implored him to go faster, Khannouchi said
he wanted to shout, ``Don't worry, I know what I am doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Khannouchi stayed in contention as Tanui sped away with
times of 4:40, 4:40 and 4:33 for miles 17, 18, 19, and by mile 22
even the Moroccan was still 27 seconds back. But that was about to
change spectacularly, as Tanui began to fade and Khannouchi decided
it was time to strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't make a quick move,'' he said. ``I stayed relaxed and
saved my energy. The last 2 miles I ran incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   That he did. Shaving about 5 seconds per half-mile off Tanui's
lead, Khannouchi stalked Tanui for 2 miles before the faltering
Kenyan looked over his left shoulder to discover the Moroccan
quickly gaining. Having already realized he had surged far too
early (at 30K instead of 35K) and faced 3.1 more miles than he had
been planning on, Tanui had no answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just thinking, I must go and finish the race,'' said a
resigned Tanui, who will take home $90,000 in prize money and
bonuses. ``It was anyway my mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   As the pair disappeared into the 310-meter-long tunnel beneath
the McCormack Place convention center, Khannouchi had a 3-meter
lead but wasn't ready to celebrate (``Moses Tanui has a great kick
and he could come back and catch me''). By the time they emerged
from the darkness it was closer to 40 meters. From there, it was a
race against the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Eyes watery from the wind and a 20-degree wind chill at the 7:30
a.m. start, Khannouchi couldn't see the clock on the pace car for
the last 4 miles, and didn't know how close he was to the record
until he crossed the finish line and stumbled into the arms of his
wife and coach, Sandra. ``We did it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I happen to hold it for only one hour,'' said Khannouchi of
the world record, it would be all right with him. ``If somebody
would come and break it now, I'd be happy.''

A HEALTHY DOSE OF GIVE AND TAKE 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Denver gave. The Patriots took. It's as
simple as that.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos Sunday as much as said, ``If you want to run it, go
ahead. We're stopping Drew Bledsoe.'' And for the most part they
did. What kept them from winning, as New England claimed a 24-23
victory, were Patriot running backs Terry Allen and Kevin Faulk.
</P>
<P>
   Allen is a master craftsman with a football under his arm. He
has a sixth sense of where the defenders are going to go before the
ball is even snapped.
</P>
<P>
   With several brilliant individual moves, Allen carved out 106
yards to key the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Faulk had 238 yards of combined offense. His work on returns
provided good field position for his offense, which had it much
better than Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly because of Faulk, the Patriots' average starting point
was their 35. For Denver, it was their 19, which became critical in
a 1-point game.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots only had 54 offensive plays, which is unusual. And,
almost unbelievably, they won without ever having a drive of more
than seven plays.
</P>
<P>
   Denver's defensive coordinator, Greg Robinson, one of the best
in the game, always defenses the Patriots well.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson wanted to keep Bledsoe from making big plays to his
wide receivers. He wanted his coverage to be such that his rushers
had time to get some hits on Bledsoe. They did, but not enough.
Bledsoe was sacked four times, twice at key points in the fourth
quarter when Robinson simply outmanned the New England offensive
formation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those last two blitzes they came with eight or nine guys,''
said Bledsoe, ``and we just didn't have time to get rid of the
ball. I wanted to go to my hot receiver, and they had him covered.
So I had to hold onto the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry Glenn, Vincent Brisby, and Shawn Jefferson had a total of
five catches. Bledsoe had just 13 completions, but not all of the
Denver defensive game plan worked.
</P>
<P>
   Allen did the most to beat it. With the Patriots leading, 17-10,
in the third quarter, Allen put together what would prove to be the
winning sequence for New England. On first down at his 31, Allen
ran toward the middle, made a quick hop to his right at the line,
put a head fake on a linebacker, then took off down the sideline
for 39 yards. Three plays later, on second and 10 at the Denver 19,
he blew through the middle for 18 yards to the 1, and finished it
with a blast into the middle to give New England 24 points. After
that, Denver shut down the Patriots' running game. In the final 23
minutes, New England gained 22 yards on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The telling part of the game for New England was the closing
minutes of the second period and the opening of the third, when
Allen got the final touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The score was tied at 10 with 1:13 left in the first half, and
Bledsoe was faced with second and 12 on his 32. Denver was
pressuring with each play. Bledsoe faded to throw, sidestepped a
rusher, stepped up, and threw a frozen rope down the right hashmark
to Glenn, who eluded two defenders and scrambled to the 1, setting
up an Allen scoring run.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents continue to focus on Bledsoe. Sunday, offensive
coordinator Ernie Zampese changed up a little. ``We used more
double tight end and more two running back (formations) than we
have before,'' said Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   The second tight end, and extra running back, gave the Patriots'
running game more punch. Tony Simmons didn't play a down as a wide
receiver after leading the team two weeks ago in Kansas City with
seven catches.
</P>
<P>
   Zampese wanted to protect Bledsoe as best he could, give him
some semblance of a running attack to work with, and not expose him
to wide open shots from the Denver defense, which always has a few
blitzes in its package that the opposition hasn't seen before.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Griese did a nice job for Denver. Don't forget, he was
playing without Terrell Davis and Shannon Sharpe, his two major
weapons. It was obvious that coach Mike Shanahan's offensive
package is not as deep and diversified as it was when the great
John Elway was around.
</P>
<P>
   There were no turnovers. Griese was under a lot of pressure, but
he didn't panic and throw the ball into coverage. Denver had a big
edge in total net yards, 442-325, yet lost.
</P>
<P>
   New England played the first 42-plus minutes without getting a
penalty, while Denver had seven. But just about the time one was
thinking ``home cooking,'' they had five coming down the stretch,
which helped keep a couple of Denver drives alive in the fourth
period.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest surprise in the game, beyond Allen's running from
scrimmage, was the way the Patriots had the wide edge on special
teams. On return yardage they had 210 yards, as opposed to 132 for
Denver. Denver generally has some of the best special teams in the
league, and the Patriots had been hurt by injury.

US MEN'S EIGHT CONTROLS RIVER 
</HEADLINE>
 OF CHARLES REGATTA-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ It wasn't so much a race as it was a 3-mile
victory lap. The US men's eight hadn't taken a spin in front of the
home folks since they'd won their third straight world title in
August. Sunday was their chance to have an entire river to
themselves and hear hosannas from both shores.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is kind of a reward,'' coach Mike Teti said, after the
Yanks had beaten the Germans by 12 seconds to claim their record
fifth straight championship at the Head of the Charles Regatta
Sunday afternoon. ``When they heard themselves announced as the
1999 world champions before the start, that was kind of a rush for
these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also a point of pride for them to leave the rest of the
field in their wake. ``It's not so much a matter of pressure,''
said Teti, ``but the expectation is that if you're the world
champions, you're going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   For the dozens of oarspeople wearing US Rowing gear here, that
was exactly the expectation and with rare exceptions they turned
the Head into their intramural championships. The men's four,
rowing as the Princeton Training Center, retained its crown by a
whopping 33 seconds over the Craftsbury Sculling Center. The men's
and women's lightweight eights, the women's double of Wendy Wilbur
and Stephanie Gregg, and lightweight scullers Dave Sanderson and
Christine Collins are all national team members. All of them won
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   So did Don Smith, a US sweep oarsman who stepped into a single
scull and knocked off a tough international field that included two
former world champs. ``It's good to do well in a race that hasn't
treated me that well in the past,'' said Smith, who beat US Olympic
sculler Cy Beasley by 9 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The Head is an aquatic roulette wheel, spinning out winners and
losers whimsically. ``That's the fun of the race,'' Teti said.
``It's tough to gauge. You don't really know where you are.''
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian women's eight didn't know until just before they
got their medals that they'd edged the US by 1 second for their
third title in four years. ``We knew we had beaten the (defending
champion) Danish because we had caught up to them,'' said cox
Lesley Thompson. ``And we knew it was close with the Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   The women's singles was close enough between Australia's
Georgina Douglas and Canada's Marnie McBean that it was flashed as
a dead heat on the Magazine Beach scoreboard. Douglas, who ended up
winning by 28 hundredths of a second, had no idea.
</P>
<P>
   She had flown up from Melbourne on Tuesday and spent the week
getting over jet lag and trying to reckon how many times the river
could twist. ``I row on a river (the Yarra) as well,'' said
Douglas. ``So I'm used to looking around and going under bridges.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference Sunday was that Douglas was also trying to weave
her way through a world-class field that included not only McBean,
the best all-around oarswoman in history, but also world bronze
medalist Rumiana Neikova of Bulgaria (who ended up 11th), defending
champ Julia Chilicki (eighth), and top US sculler Leslie
Burns-Rawley (third).
</P>
<P>
   That was no accident.
</P>
<P>
   Regatta officials made a point of beefing up the elite singles
fields this year, bringing in a bunch of folks who'll be in Sydney
next summer. The men's field was brutal _ two former world titlists
in Jamie Koven, and Juri Jaanson of Estonia, plus world double
winner Luka Spik of Slovenia, and Dutch champion Merlin Vervoorn.
</P>
<P>
   Though Smith was seeded second behind two-time victor Koven,
he'd always had trouble negotiating the serpentine course. Not
Sunday. ``Don stole the show, no doubt about it,'' said Koven. ``He
made a move on me at the 2-mile mark, just before the big turn. He
rowed a great race. I just wish I could have been up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the women's eight, the US men had a rowover. Once
the Canadians scratched and the Germans brought only two men from
their world boat, the Yanks thought they might be home free. ``We
pulled away from (second-seeded) Princeton right away,'' said
Porter Collins.
</P>
<P>
   From then on, they had a vast swatch of open water. As long as
cox Pete Cipollone didn't doze off and hit an abutment, the world
champs were in for a style cruise. Once they came swinging around
Dead Man's Curve, they could have rowed with one hand and waved
with the other.
</P>
<P>
   It was a row for show. On Wednesday, the US men fly to
Switzerland for a long-distance race on Lake Geneva that finishes
in front of the Olympic museum in Lausanne. Juan Antonio Samaranch,
chief Lord of the Rings, will present the medals. If the Yanks
flash their credentials, maybe he'll give them his Sydney set for
safekeeping.

PULLING NO PUNCHES ON TYSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ There should be no fourth second chance for Mike
Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Not this time. Not after he embarrassed himself and disgraced
the sport that has made him a millionaire for the third time in his
last three fights.
</P>
<P>
   Not after his pattern of disregard for the rules and for his
opponents was on display once again for the world to see.
</P>
<P>
   Not after he did what he'd promised he'd do a week before the
fight when he told the Los Angeles Times he'd do anything in the
ring, including bite an opponent again, if he felt he had to.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't happen to Orlin Norris Saturday night. He escaped
with his ears intact. But he couldn't say the same for his knee
after Tyson's latest fiasco ended in a no-contest when he
cold-cocked Norris two seconds after the bell ended the first round
at the MGM Grand Garden.
</P>
<P>
   In a familiar pattern, the former heavyweight champion then
blamed Norris for refusing to continue participating in a street
fight rather than the prizefight he'd contracted to be part of
after his right knee suffered what Dr. Flip Homansky said was a
dislocation.
</P>
<P>
   To hear Tyson tell it, in his last three fights Evander
Holyfield stuck his ears in his mouth, Frans Botha stuck his arm
under Tyson's and tried to break it, and Norris proved a coward for
not continuing on when his knee popped when he was popped after
referee Richard Steele clearly said, ``Stop punching.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson was the victim again Saturday night, as he always claims
to be. A victim of his reputation, his celebrity, his sport's
hatred of him, and his opponent's willingness to stay down to
ensure a $2 million payday for a rematch that was in his contract
if something ever went awry for Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   A victim not of his own lack of self-control but of everyone
else's conspiracies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't want to fight anymore,'' Tyson said after he
learned his $10 million purse was being withheld pending a full
review of the incident by the Nevada State Athletic Commission this
week. ``I'm tired of this bull. Anyone who's competitive, even if
he's got a fractured leg, would get back up and fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He walked back to his corner. That shows you how twisted his
knee was. He must have hurt it getting on the stool.''
</P>
<P>
   No, he hurt it after a manic-depressive who is regularly taken
off the antidepressant medication Zoloft several weeks before men
without a conscience send him into the ring to act out in bizarre
fashion hit him in the face with a short left hand after the bell.
</P>
<P>
   As the stunned Norris collapsed to the floor, his knee buckled
under him and he stayed on his back before starting to rise as
Tyson stared menacingly at him, a bully on the loose. Steele
immediately deducted 2 points from Tyson and then turned his
attention to Norris, who walked splay-legged to his corner and sat
on his stool with his leg extended in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   When the bell sounded to open the second round, Norris didn't
move and his chief handler, Abel Sanchez, walked over to Steele and
said his fighter couldn't continue. When he did, Tyson stalked to
the center of the ring toward Norris but Steele directed him to a
neutral corner where he paced liked the caged and frightened animal
he has become in the ring since Holyfield first exposed him.
</P>
<P>
   After a long discussion between Steele, Nevada State Commission
executive director Marc Ratner, and Homansky, the bout was ruled a
no-contest pending further review by the full commission. When that
was announced Tyson seemed to spin into a rage but promoter Dan
Goossen rushed in along with Tyson's cornermen and calmed him as
Norris continued to sit with an ice bag strapped to his knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``He quit,'' Tyson said. ``How do I hit him in the jaw and he
hurt his leg?''
</P>
<P>
   Probably because when he hit him it was a) after the bell, b)
coming out of a clinch, c) after Steele had ordered both men to
stop punching, and d) while he was still holding Norris with one
arm. Other than that, there was no reason Norris shouldn't have
been able to defend himself from an opponent who no longer has the
self-control to follow even the most basic rules of boxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just hit me after the bell and I went down the wrong way on
my right knee,'' Norris said before leaving for Valley Hospital on
a stretcher while still in his trunks to undergo an MRI.
</P>
<P>
   Later Goossen would claim Norris's cornermen were heard telling
their fighter to stay down and implying this was a devious plan to
ensure a rematch rather than an act of concern for their charge.
The possibility that this suggestion was made because Norris's knee
was already beginning to swell eluded Goossen in a way Norris could
not elude that punch.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter what they told him after Tyson did to Norris
what he had done to Botha after the first round of their fight and
what he had done to Holyfield in the first round of their first
confrontation. He fired his gun after an official cease-fire had
been declared. When Norris's brother, Terry, did the same thing he
was immediately disqualified and lost his super welterweight title
but this is Tyson the human ATM, not some journeyman, so the rules
do not apply. Or at least are not applied in the same way.
</P>
<P>
   This time they should be. This time should be the last time
Tyson gets the opportunity to disgrace himself and the memory of
Hall of Fame trainer Cus D'Amato, the man who tried to save him
from the streets but unwittingly set him on an even more
self-destructive path.
</P>
<P>
   The Tyson who leveled Norris late looked nothing like the one
who had dropped two sparring partners with crisp combinations in
open sparring sessions last week. In those controlled sessions he
appeared to be the same fearsome fighting machine he had been the
night he became the youngest heavyweight champion in history 13
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But when the bright lights were turned on him Saturday night,
Tyson melted again. He appeared tense before the opening bell and
when the fight began he missed one wild hook after another, landing
only two body shots and a soft jab until he threw the
extracurricular left hand that may have thrown his career into its
final act if the Nevada Athletic Commission stands for anything but
the national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   Only with Orlin Norris's hands down and under orders not to
punch did Iron Mike Tyson unleash a knockout blow.
</P>
<P>
   It is time to count Mike Tyson out and let him move on with his
life. Without boxing, maybe he can still have one.

DEFENDING CHAMP KOVEN IS FIFTH 
</HEADLINE>
 OF CHARLES-KOVEN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ From Europe they came, some of the best men scullers in
the world invited for the first time to row in a championship class
in this 35th Head of the Charles Regatta.
</P>
<P>
   They were all chasing one American _ Jamie Koven, defending
champion of this event and former world champion _ but ended up
getting beat by another.
</P>
<P>
   As the elite singles began the big lefthand turn into the Eliot
Street Bridge, 31-year-old Don Smith, a men's fours rower on the US
national team, had streaked past Koven, all the top Europeans, and
the other Americans.
</P>
<P>
   One of the final races in the two-day event, the championship
singles was rowed in late afternoon with chilly gusts of west wind
rippling across the lengthening shadows on the river.
</P>
<P>
   In second place was another US rower, Cyrus Beasley, who,
recovering from a dislocated shoulder, rowed his strongest race
since he was injured in an accident in August. Beasley rowed in the
Olympics, and won gold medals for singles scull in the '95 and '98
World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   Beasley started 32d and rowed through much of the fleet for his
second-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   As defending champion, Koven started first, hitting what seemed
a strong stride around the first turns. But as the race extended
past the 2-mile mark, Koven began to fade as Smith and Beasley came
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see I was going by him,'' said Smith, who at 6 feet 7
inches, 207 pounds is the tallest rower in the race. ``I was using
Jamie as a gauge, and as I began moving on him in the third mile, I
knew I was having a good race.''
</P>
<P>
   Koven, who ended up fifth, said his early race was strong, but
``I paced well for a couple of miles but then I didn't have much
left. I was disappointed in my race.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Smith's 32-stroke pace held up as he steered 90
degrees left in front of the Cambridge Boat Club, squirted under
the Eliot Street Bridge, and sprinted for the finish.
</P>
<P>
   Primarily a rower on the fours team, Smith hopes his finish will
help gain him the sponsorship he needs to train as a single. A
graduate of MIT Business School, Smith has been working as an
investment analyst, but because he's in training toward the 2000
Olympics, he feels the need to get more training time.
</P>
<P>
   Smith won a gold medal in the eights at the 1994 FISA World
Championships and the Goodwill Games. He won gold in the eights and
pairs at the 1995 Pan American Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm one of the top singles in the US. There's a lot of
good competition out there. Winning the Head of the Charles can't
hurt me.''
</P>
<P>
   The addition of the elite European rowers in this year's event
created a spark, said Smith. And those invited, most finishing in
the top 15, said they would be back, if invited.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very nice race, fabulous,'' said Luka Spik, a
20-year-old world champion from Slovenia. Spik said he thought he
had a chance at winning the race, but on a sinuous river like the
Charles, ``It is very difficult to pass another boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Merlin Vervoorn from the Netherlands, another international
medalist, said the Head of the Charles' invitation of elite rowers
would turn the regatta quickly into a ``world-class event.''
</P>
<P>
   The mix of elite racers and club amateurs is not only rare, but
``very impressive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Regatta co-founder D'arcy MacMahon said that while the elite
rowers would add a competitive edge to the race, the Head of the
Charles will remain low-key in the commercial elements of the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need sponsors, but this race will never be about money.
It's about the rowers, the volunteers, and the spectators. It's sad
how commercial sports get, and we don't want that to ever happen
with this race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great for the ego to have Olympians and these top racers
here,'' said MacMahon, ``but the heart of this race will always be
the crew from East Oshkosh who got themselves here on bake sales
and car washes. We can never forget them.''

WOMEN'S SINGLES CAME DOWN TO WIRE 
</HEADLINE>
 OF CHARLES-WOMEN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ The projected finish of the women's
championship singles placed Georgina Douglas in first place, but
the Australian rower was reluctant to pronounce herself the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing the bright yellow and dark green colors of her country
as she returned to the Cambridge Boat Club, Douglas avoided comment
about the results in a race decided by time with penalties factored
in. She laughed off questions about the importance of a win over
scullers who had beaten her at the World Championships in August.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas knew how tough the competition was and would not believe
she had won until she saw the results. The Australian sculler's
decision to wait proved wise. The race was so tight that three
versions of the results circulated before the awards ceremony. When
the last printed copy of the results became available, Douglas
learned she had won the championship singles in 20:20.06. The
Australian's time bested friend and rival Marnie McBean by .28
hundreths of a seconds.
</P>
<P>
   But the close finish did not spark any bitterness or
disappointment by McBean. Instead, it brought to light the close
relationship between the two elite rowers. When Douglas was
announced the winner, McBean was the first to offer
congratulations. The two have trained and raced together in the
past and flip-flopped finishes this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty excited because when I come over from Australia
with such a big time difference, it's something that I never
expect,'' said Douglas about her win. ``I just came out to have fun
and be competitive. Having trained for only a couple of weeks, I
didn't expect it.''
</P>
<P>
   About McBean, Douglas said: ``We get along quite well off the
water, but you can't take your friendships onto the water, because
if you do that you're the only one that's going to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Added McBean, ``I would say there's a friendly rivalry.
Professionally, we know we always want to be ahead of the other
one, but we also know that we get along quite well. And 20 years
from now I'd rather have a friend than a competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   The race turned on Dead Man's Curve, which runs from just before
the Cambridge Boat House under the Eliot Street Bridge. McBean took
a wide turn around the bend. At one point, the Canadian sculler
thought she saw her Australian competitor steal a look back at the
wider line she had chosen. Douglas knew she could make up time on
an inside turn. She went on the attack and made up what would later
prove valuable seconds. When McBean passed the Cambridge Boat
House, she had the fastest split. Then, Douglas passed the same
checkpoint and she had the fastest time.
</P>
<P>
   McBean tried to make up the seconds she had lost en route to the
finish, less than a mile away at that point. The Canadian fell just
short.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take the best course that you can,'' said Douglas. ``It
was probably to her disadvantage that she took (the turn) a little
bit wider.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, Douglas and McBean were exchanging trade secrets
as they trained in Australia and raced as a double at the
Australian Nationals. Normally, the two compete against each other
and trade places. McBean defeated Douglas twice during her two
months in Australia. Douglas traveled to Canada and defeated McBean
in the Commonwealth Regatta in London, Ontario. At the World
Championships, McBean finished sixth overall, followed by Douglas
in seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we probably both gained from training with each
other,'' said McBean, whose impressive rowing resume includes three
Olympic gold medals and three World Championship gold medals. ``I
was giving her tips on how to row a tailwind. She was reminding me
about power application.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not McBean and Douglas will renew their friendly
rivalry next year in Sydney remains to be seen. The Canadian is
certain she will row in the singles event at the 2000 Olympics. The
Australian has told selectors to place her in the boat with the
best chance of medaling. But Sunday along the Charles River, both
competitors knew exactly where the other one was.

CELTICS EXPECT TO PICK UP THE PACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEXINGTON, Ky. _ The Celtics are about to step up the pace. They
have won only once in regulation time in five exhibition games
going into Monday night's game against Atlanta in Biloxi, Miss.,
and there will be an increased sense of urgency with the
regular-season opener looming in Toronto Nov. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to judge how we are going to do right now,'' guard
Dana Barros said. ``This is a learning process and we have to
figure out the best rotations. Not that these games haven't been
serious, but it's about time to start picking up the pace and
getting a little more serious about games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics' 93-92 loss to Utah Saturday night highlighted both
their strengths and weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, the Celtics imposed their aggressiveness and
transition game on the Jazz. But John Stockton began finding
openings in the Celtic defense, and Utah took control in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Rick Pitino blamed the breakdowns on a lack of
conditioning, but said the Celtics would be able to sustain the
pace once the regular season begins.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics were unable to disrupt the Jazz offense in the
second half, and their transition game suffered. They displayed
little effectiveness in the half-court game, with the exception of
Barros, who scored 22 points on nine field-goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been with the Celtics and (Pitino) longer than anyone
else, so I know the system,'' Barros said. ``I know my role and
what is expected and I don't have to spend a lot of time figuring
it out. Some of the guys may take a little more time to get used to
the system here. They might have been used to different roles on
different teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our offense is not clicking consistently but once we get in a
little better shape we'll be able to push the pace the whole
game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics seem athletic enough to set the pace against many
teams. But they missed Danny Fortson, who is recovering from right
foot surgery, against Utah. And, they suffered when Stockton began
penetrating effectively in the second half, setting up open shots
and preventing the Celtics from finding a rhythm. The Celtics held
a 59-47 halftime lead but converted only one field goal in the
first 6:31 of the second half as Utah began setting the tempo. The
Celtics scored only 14 points in the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Utah, even with Karl Malone out, is a wiser team in the
halfcourt than we are right now,'' Pitino said. ``We have to take
advantage of that in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to try to be able to sustain the pace for both halves
of the game. This is a new pace for everybody in basketball. If we
can sustain the pace we had in the first half we will have more
success. When we slow down and play under the influence of fatigue
we lose.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Walter McCarty, who has influenza, returned to Boston Sunday and
will miss Monday night's game . . . The Celtics practiced for 2 1/2
hours at Lexington Coliseum. Wayne Turner participated in the
session and is probable for Monday night after missing the Utah
game with bursitis in his right elbow.

WHO'S NO. 1? IT'S NOT EXACTLY CLEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ What's evident from seeing the carnage of several Top
10 teams is that the question of who's No. 1 has no definitive
answer.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State (8-0) made enough mistakes to lose two games
Saturday but still hung on to beat Clemson, 17-14, in the Bowden
Bowl, which matched Seminoles coach Bobby Bowden against his son,
Tommy, in the first father-son duel in Division 1-A history.
</P>
<P>
   It was also Bowden's 300th career win and marked the return of
wide receiver Peter Warrick after two games in limbo because of
legal problems.
</P>
<P>
   But as Bowden said Saturday night, ``Are we still No. 1? Yes.
But we certainly didn't play like it.''
</P>
<P>
   No, they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that no one else did either. Penn State (8-0) was
outplayed but beat Purdue, 31-25. Nebraska (6-1) was outplayed in
losing to Texas, 24-20, and neither Kansas State (7-0) nor Virginia
Tech (6-0) has quite the juice to convince the pollsters it is the
best team in college football.
</P>
<P>
   So what we have is a handful of teams worthy of the top spot,
including steadily rising Tennessee (5-1), which knocked off
Alabama, 21-7, for the fifth straight time Saturday, and in
Tuscaloosa.
</P>
<P>
   The first Bowl Championship Series rankings will be released
Monday night and no doubt will cause another flurry of controversy,
particularly if Virginia Tech, which is the favorite of most of the
computers, is on top. But those rankings currently are for
informational and argumentative purposes only.
</P>
<P>
   Games are still to be played and teams will rise and fall as
they did Saturday, when Nebraska, Michigan State (6-2), Michigan
(5-2), Alabama (5-2), and Texas A&AMP;M (5-2) all were among upper-tier
teams that lost.
</P>
<P>
   If there is an underlying theme, it is being sent by Kansas
State and Virginia Tech. If you do the Hokie pokey and avoid tough
nonconference opponents, you too can enjoy an unbeaten season and
high BCS rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Which is indeed ironic. One of the arguments against a playoff
system is that it would diminish the regular season and the good
teams would duck each other because a loss could affect their
status as a playoff team.
</P>
<P>
   So we have no playoff system, and the teams benefiting the most
are those with the softest schedules.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boston College coach Tom O'Brien is probably facing the toughest
challenge of his career. The Eagles' 31-28 loss to Miami could be a
season-killer unless O'Brien can convince his team there is life
after it blew a 28-0 lead to the visiting Hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   If O'Brien can't do it, it could affect the entire program.
</P>
<P>
   BC had fallen as low as it could three years ago when the
betting scandal ripped the Eagles apart. After two 4-7 seasons,
'Brien built some confidence with the Eagles' 4-0 start, although
against admittedly inferior competition.
</P>
<P>
   A 24-14 loss to Temple Oct. 9 temporarily destroyed that
confidence, but the quick and seemingly insurmountable lead against
Miami appeared to have the Eagles poised to move forward again.
</P>
<P>
   Now they must deal with what is arguably one of the toughest
losses in the school's history.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Bowden Bowl was toughest on Bobby Bowden's wife, Ann, who
watched the game with about 50 friends and relatives wearing a
combined Florida State-Clemson sweatshirt. After the game, Ann
admitted her loyalties still remained with her husband, Bobby.
Joked Tommy, ``She's not my mother, she's my father's wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Turnabout is fair play. After getting beaten by a combined score
of 80-7 over the last two seasons, Oklahoma defeated Texas A&AMP;M,
51-6. It was the Aggies' worst loss in 98 years . . . Who's hot?
Wisconsin. The Badgers (6-2) have won their last two home games
against Indiana and Michigan State by a combined score of 99-10.
Who's not? Michigan State. The once-mighty Spartan defense has been
outscored, 92-38, the last two weeks, including a 40-10 pounding by
Wisconsin Saturday in which Badgers running back Ron Dayne put
himself back in the Heisman Trophy forefront with 214 rushing yards
and two touchdowns. Said Michigan State coach Nick Saban, whose
team committed 11 turnovers in the losses to Purdue and Wisconsin:
``I'm a little shocked because I thought we were ready to play.''
Obviously not.
</P>
<P>
   Also in a state of disbelief was Michigan coach Lloyd Carr, who
saw his Wolverines squander a 27-7 third-quarter lead to Illinois
and lose, 35-29. ``I have no idea how this team will rebound,''
said Carr . . . The slow start, fast finish award goes to Kansas
State and Miami. The teams trailed Oklahoma State and BC,
respectively, by a combined 49-0 and then fashioned comebacks in
which they outscored their opponents by a combined 75-0.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maryland's 45-7 rout over North Carolina continues the Terps'
resurgence. With a 5-2 record, they are one win from becoming bowl
eligible and off to their best start since 1985 . . . After
Tennessee beat Alabama, the Volunteers took out cigars and chanted:
``We own Alabama.'' Alabama coach Mike Dubose wouldn't disagree:
``I said going into the game that Tennessee may be the best
football team in the country, and they didn't do anything to make
me think otherwise.'' . . . One of the best coaching jobs in the
country has been turned in by first-year man June Jones, who has
guided Hawaii to a 5-2 record after a 35-21 win over Tulsa. The
Rainbows were 0-12 last season . . . Things are getting worse for
South Carolina, which is 0-8 after an 11-10 loss to Vanderbilt. Lou
Holtz, in his first year with South Carolina, is suffering through
the worst losing streak of his career, the Gamecocks have lost a
nation-longest 18 straight, and his wife, Beth, is battling throat
cancer . . . Mississippi State's 17-16 victory over LSU improves
the Bulldogs' record to 7-0, their best start ever. They are in
prime position to win the SEC West race and face either Florida or
Tennessee in the league championship game in Atlanta in December.

PUMPKIN-COOK AND PUMPKIN-SEEDS) 
 
 
By NATALIE HAUGHTON 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Halloween and pumpkins go hand in hand _ and
there's plenty of good eating in store beyond pumpkin pie.
Possibilities range from soups and butters to breads, pancakes,
stuffings _ even entrees _ pies, desserts and more.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Great Little Pumpkin Cookbook,'' by Michael Krondl
(CelestialArts; $5.95), you'll find interesting innovations, such
as a pumpkin stuffed with layers of chicken, chiles and tortillas
and then baked; or Pumpkin Tamales With Smoky Tomato Salsa; Pumpkin
Stuffed Ravioli With Pumpkin Seed Cream; Savory Italian Rice,
Spinach and Pumpkin Torte; Farfalle With Pumpkin and Pecorino
Cheese; Indian Pumpkin Fritters; Pumpkin Spanakopita; Catalan Pork,
Bean and Pumpkin Stew; Pumpkin Blintzes with Caramelized Ginger;
and a wealth of other creations using the golden orb in one form or
another.
</P>
<P>
   You can cook and puree fresh pumpkin flesh _ which isn't
difficult but takes a little time and patience _ or you can opt for
using canned pumpkin puree _ which may be the best route for busy
cooks.
</P>
<P>
   After experimenting with cooking fresh pumpkin _ which turned
out to be a big hassle _ it's easy to understand why the majority
of cooks rely on convenient canned pumpkin puree or canned pumpkin
pie mix (with sugar and spices in the pumpkin) on supermarket
shelves, ready to use on a moment's notice.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the eating pumpkins grown commercially end up in cans _
some 150,000 tons of them _ notes Krondl in his book. And Libby's
owns about 80 percent of the canned market. In 1929, the company
began its pumpkin processing operations, and the first canned
pumpkin made its way to grocers' shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Don't let me discourage you if you want to try your hand at
cooking fresh.
</P>
<P>
   But if you plan to cook fresh pumpkins, be forewarned. ``Most
large pumpkins are bland and watery and best suited to
jack-o'-lanterns,'' writes Krondl. He recommends using the orange
cooking varieties _ such as sugar or pie pumpkin _ which weigh
about 7 pounds. Or another possibility for cooking fresh is the
cheese pumpkin variety _ which is beige on the outside and has
thick and tasty orange meat.
</P>
<P>
   If you purchase your pumpkin from a grower, ask about the
varieties best for cooking and pureeing. When choosing a pumpkin
for cooking, some growers advise selecting a dark orange one. The
darker the color, generally the more meat or flesh it will have.
Also select pumpkins that are firm and with skins free of cracks,
spots or excessive scars.
</P>
<P>
   Although some varieties may yield better cooked pumpkin results
than others, I've cooked up medium-size (not gigantic or oversized
ones) run-of-the mill Halloween pumpkins (variety unknown)
purchased at the market _ and they've produced good, edible pumpkin
puree. Experiment if you have the time and inclination.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to peel a pumpkin, notes Krondl in his book, is
to cut it in half and scoop out the seeds and stringy pieces. Then
cut into 2- to 3-inch-wide slices and cut away the hard skin. (Some
recipes call for removing the skin after cooking, which is often
easier.) You can store cut-up, uncooked pumpkin up to four days in
the fridge.
</P>
<P>
   If your fresh pumpkin turns out too watery once it's cooked and
pureed, cook it over low heat (to drive off some of the moisture)
until it is the desired consistency, or the consistency of canned
pumpkin. Or place the watery pumpkin in a strainer and allow it to
drain an hour or two, stirring occasionally. And if you end up with
a surplus, remember that pureed pumpkin can be frozen if
well-wrapped.
</P>
<P>
   When you use pumpkin in recipes, figure that 1 pound raw,
uncooked pumpkin will yield about 3/4 to 1 cup of cooked mashed
pumpkin. And when it comes to nutritional value, pumpkin shares
similar food values with other deep yellow winter squash. On cup of
unseasoned pureed pumpkin has about 75 to 80 calories and only a
trace of fat. Pumpkin is also exceptionally high in vitamin A (in
the form of beta-carotene) and is high in dietary fiber.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter whether it comes from your garden, a farm stand or
even a can, whether it's cut out to be a fearsome porch ornament,
an ingredient in exotic stew, or plain old pie, you know it'll
carve a grin on your face. It does on mine,'' writes Krondl.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of good eating in pumpkin _ either fresh or
canned. Clip and save these recipes to use now and throughout the
holiday season. &UR;  &QL;

THE VINDICATION OF MARTHA STEWART 
</HEADLINE>
  (Slate commentary)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (David Plotz is Slate's Washington bureau chief)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By DAVID PLOTZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is a (partial) list of objects that Martha Stewart has
gilded on recent TV shows: pomegranates, pumpkins, cookies,
chocolate truffles, wrapping paper, oak leaves, acorns, and--no
kidding--okra. The only thing Martha has not gilded is the lily.
But wait till it's back in season.
</P>
<P>
   Martha has proved that alchemy is not impossible: Brush enough
gold paint on enough flora, and eventually you'll make real gold.
Last Tuesday's initial public offering for Martha Stewart Living
Omnimedia--Omnimedia, has there ever been a more perfect
name?--killed on Wall Street, rising from $18 to $52 before
settling at $36.
</P>
<P>
   She arrived at the stock exchange that morning toting a tray of
brioches. She left that evening holding $1.2 billion (in stock, not
dough).
</P>
<P>
   Investors bought a brilliant company: Omnimedia--a Web site,
mail-order operation, two TV shows, two magazines, Kmart
partnership, and 27 books--netted $24 million last year from the
gospel of Martha. Kmart sold more than $750 million worth of
Martha-branded products in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Her 1997 decision to divorce Time Warner and go solo--a split
that cost her more than $50 million--has never looked better.
</P>
<P>
   What was missing from Martha's IPO was the sniping and mockery
that has dogged all of her ventures. Traditionally, Martha has been
battered by three criticisms. First, she is simply ludicrous. You
could not imagine better comic material than her ideas of
``living'': the ``midnight omelet dinner for 1,000''; the fruit
baskets the size of a Chevy; the advice (in this month's magazine)
to make your own envelopes out of wood veneer, folding them with a
bone knife.
</P>
<P>
   Parodies barely exaggerate when they imagine Martha turning
water into wine (''a lovely Merlot'') or manufacturing condoms from
her own lamb.
</P>
<P>
   A second and more thoughtful batch of critics has charged her
with encouraging class division, promoting soulless domestic
conformism, and undermining working women by making them feel
domestically inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   The final criticism has been personal. As her unauthorized
biography, ``Just Desserts,'' contends, Martha is an icy, horrible
person who abused her (now ex-) husband, ignores her daughter,
belittles her mother, sues her gardener for pennies, plagiarizes
recipes from better cooks, and humiliates her staff. Her fabled
``Remembering'' columns are a hash of bunkum and hyperbole. The
persona she cultivates--the warm, welcoming hostess with a
close-knit family--is a fraud.
</P>
<P>
   These criticisms have subsided partly because of America's
culture of financial idolatry. Anyone who's worth a billion on
paper is worth sucking up to.
</P>
<P>
   Martha is benefiting from parody fatigue as well. She has been a
figure of fun since ``Entertaining'' was published in 1982, so all
the jokes are old.
</P>
<P>
   And the vitality of the economy is inoculating her. Fripperies
that seemed obscene during the early '90s recession are quite
modest by the standards of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But the critical silence may also represent a long-overdue
recognition that Martha is, as she would say, a Good Thing. In a
Tuesday TV interview, she called herself a ``teacher. ... We are
offering information, high-quality, well-researched, how-to
information.'' That is a fair description.
</P>
<P>
   What she does is not silly at all, or at least no more silly
than most advice magazines. Her magazines and TV shows retain just
enough nonsense to make them irksome (''sew your own pashmina from
home-raised llamas,'' and the like), but she supplies valuable
instruction about the mundane tasks of life.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Stewart Living may be the most useful magazine this side
of Consumer Reports. This month's issue, for example, offers
excellent advice about making spicy popcorn snacks, cleaning ovens,
and storing rugs and china, among other subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Her weekly CBS morning segment packs more helpful cooking
information into six minutes than most cooking shows do in an hour.
</P>
<P>
   It is not false consciousness that makes tens of millions of
people follow Martha every month. It is her good advice.
</P>
<P>
   But the great achievement of Martha's domestic gospel is not
practical but moral. She has a puritanical sensibility. She
believes in the uplifting power of work. She instructs you so that
you will know how to create objects yourself, grow plants yourself,
learn home repair yourself, cook food yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Doing something well is good and liberating and fulfilling. It
strengthens friendships and families: When I saw her making waffles
the other day, it made me want to make waffles this Sunday. If I
make waffles on Sunday, I will invite the downstairs neighbors up
to eat them, and that is undoubtedly a Good Thing.
</P>
<P>
   Martha practices materialism, but not consumerism. She believes,
rightly, that it makes you wiser and happier to cook your own
applesauce than to buy it. Well, you may say, it's easy for her to
make homemade applesauce. That's her job. But she did it when it
wasn't her job, too.
</P>
<P>
   Even if most viewers rarely practice anything Martha
preaches--she calls such slackers ``Martha Dreamers'' as opposed to
``Martha Doers''--she is still a worthy goad.
</P>
<P>
   Her DIY credo makes Martha democratically snobbish. She hews to
a country-house sensibility, but anyone can follow it. It doesn't
cost much, because you do it yourself. If a middle-class Polish
girl like Martha can blossom into an affected, Breck-girl
faux-WASP, you can too!
</P>
<P>
   The final, and most important, reason Martha is escaping
criticism is that Martha Stewart the person has been separated from
Martha Stewart the brand. The principal topic of discussion about
the Martha Stewart Living IPO was Martha Stewart's death. Analysts
speculated what would happen to Omnimedia if Martha were hit by a
bus or cab (or succumbed to an accident in ``the potting shed,'' as
the New York Observer's Christopher Byron nicely put it).
</P>
<P>
   There were two answers: First, the company has bought a $67
million life-insurance policy on her. Second, Martha Stewart the
brand can survive without Martha Stewart the person, as Ralph
Lauren the brand survives without Ralph Lauren selling every shirt.
(Martha does not appear at all in the current issue of Living.) The
zooming stock price is evidence that Wall Street can distinguish
Martha from her product.
</P>
<P>
   We should do the same. Critics have savaged her fraudulent
persona and monomaniacal perfectionism for a long time. There is a
subtle sexism in that: The female domestic tycoon is obliged to
behave better than the guys. (This is why Oprah's private life is
examined more carefully than David Letterman's.)
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, commerce has trumped personality. Martha is finally
being treated as the CEO of a company called Omnimedia, not as a
bitchy hausfrau. In the age of the divine entrepreneur, no one
cares how badly you treat your kid. We admire perfectionist
monomania in Internet tycoons, so why not in Martha? Politicians
get away with advertising bogus family bliss; Martha should too.
</P>
<P>
   On television, Martha shows us how to make a romantic dinner for
the husband she doesn't have, host a party for the kids she doesn't
like, bake muffins for the neighbors who hate her.
</P>
<P>
   But those are her tragedies, not our business (or Wall
Street's). The muffins are still tasty, and that's what matters.

 COLLEGE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   BOSTON _ To a man, Boston College's football team ached Sunday
from the stinging disappointment of Saturday's 31-28 loss to the
No. 23 Miami Hurricanes, a game in which the Eagles squandered a
28-0 lead by allowing Miami to score 31 points in the final 17:11
of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played the way we wanted to play this game,'' BC coach Tom
O'Brien said. ``But we just need to learn how to finish it.''
   And this was supposed to be the easy part of the schedule?
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, O'Brien spoke about how his team had survived the
toughest part of the schedule and had nothing to lose in the five
remaining games after the burden of unfair expectations had been
lifted by a 20-16 Big East victory over Pittsburgh Oct. 16.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, it made sense, but putting it into practice was
another story. The only thing that looked easy was Miami's miracle
comeback, which ranked as the biggest in school history. Now BC
(5-2, 2-2) will have to regroup for a trip Saturday to Syracuse,
where the Eagles will encounter a rested squad of Orangemen (5-2,
2-1), who took the weekend off after a humiliating 62-0 loss two
weeks ago at Virginia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a tough one for us, because we've gone through
two emotional games,'' O'Brien said. ``You don't like to play real
high, and I don't like to play too low. I like to play at an even
keel. We've gone from a skyrocket of emotions and one end of the
spectrum to the other, so I think this will be a key game for this
football team. If we can go play the same way we've played the last
two weeks with some fire and emotion and enthusiasm then we'll have
made bigger strides than the little steps we've been taking.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked after the game what the loss told him about his team,
O'Brien said pointedly, ``We need to recruit athletes into this
program and the ones we have better grow up, that's what it tells
me.'' Sunday, though, O'Brien indicated he was not ready to rely
upon his heralded freshman class for more contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just meant that the kids that we have _ that we perceive to
be our athletes and our best players _ the kids we're playing, they
have to play smarter and they have to play better,'' O'Brien said.
``We had too many mistakes mentally and too many missed tackles.
Granted you miss a field goal and you fumble a football, which are
bad, bad mistakes, but you're allowed to stop them on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   After BC surged to a 21-0 halftime lead by gaining 250 yards
(177 rushing) and 19 first downs on 51 offensive plays, the
Hurricanes turned the tide in the fourth quarter by capitalizing on
John Matich's 33-yard missed field goal, Cedric Washington's fumble
at the BC 6, and a critical fourth-and-17 conversion that set up
Andy Crosland's 30-yard winning field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Miami quarterback Kenny Kelly, who said he was hobbled late in
the game when his left ankle was wrenched by BC defensive tackle
Chris Hovan, completed a 22-yard pass to Reggie Wayne that set up
the winning field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to do the same things that got us there (to a 28-0
lead), but they changed their defense, and went much more
pressure-oriented,'' O'Brien said. ``A lot of those runs we split
were against their two-deep zone coverage when they were playing
pass. We did a good job of changing up what our tendencies were,
but in the second half they had eight, nine guys around the ball
and played man on the perimeter and were going to make us throw the
football.''
</P>
<P>
   After Kelly tied the game with a 10-yard TD pass to tight end
Daniel Franks, the Eagles took the field at their own 22 with 3:42
remaining. But BC went three-and-out when junior quarterback Tim
Hasselbeck fired three consecutive incompletions, including a deep
ball down the middle on third-and-10 to a double-covered Dedrick
Dewalt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we could've run it one time, but that would've been the
only other thing we would've done,'' O'Brien said. ``But you had
two opportunities where officials can make a call and they don't
make it two out of three times. Two out of three times they grabbed
Dewalt and the ball was not uncatchable.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Eagles went for a touchdown _ and lost _ when it
seemed as if all they needed in that situation was a first down.
Conversely, Miami had a chance for a touchdown on fourth-and-17
from the BC 35, but instead went for a first down and wound up
winning the game on a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the tape you can see why (Hasselbeck) throws
it to (Dewalt), because he's behind them, so you have to go with
what you read and trust in the quarterback,'' O'Brien said. ``He
thought he had a shot, and he took it, so I can't fault him for
that.''

BACKING EACH OTHER A GOOD SIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Pete Carroll and Steve Sidwell protected
Lawyer Milloy and Larry Whigham as well as they could Sunday and
Milloy and Whigham protected a defense in distress. This is called
being a team.
</P>
<P>
   In the talent-depleted NFL of 1999, the presence of versatility
in personnel is often as important as anything the big-money
superstars can do on a day like Sunday, when defeat hung in the air
like the dying leaves that surrounded Foxboro Stadium. Defeat and
the panic that would follow it were not far from the Patriots as
one linebacker after another fell to the wayside, a knee hurt here,
an ankle sprained there, until the only people left to play were
people to whom linebacker was only a name on a piece of paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have marquee players here, but this is a team,'' longtime
Pro Bowl tackle Bruce Armstrong said after defensive backs Milloy
and Whigham had spent too much time playing linebacker for their
own good after only two were left in one piece with more than a
quarter left against the Denver Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   Neither will remind anyone of Dick Butkus, but both earned a
bronze star with an oak leaf cluster for their efforts in a 24-23
victory that could have turned into a disaster if they had done a
little bit less and the Broncos had done a little bit more.
</P>
<P>
   If the Broncos had, New England would be on a three-game losing
streak this morning that would be considered a free fall. But they
are not facing that ticklish situation because Sunday Milloy,
Whigham, and to a lesser extent, Ty Law, went beyond the call when
the call was made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody had to step up and do it,'' Armstrong said. ``You
start the summer with all these guys getting reps and then you're
down to 53 with 46 plus one on Sunday. Ideally you want to have
your (starting) 22 players and your special team (starters) out
there, but it isn't like that. That's when you have to count on
other guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even I can't appreciate something like what they do. Guys like
Whigham and (backup linebackers Vernon) Crawford and Marty Moore. I
never had to know two or three positions and be ready if my number
was called. My number was always called. They have to prepare like
it will be, never knowing each and every game what's going to
happen. This game everything happened.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of what happened happened even before the game began. Ted
Johnson, Tedy Bruschi, and Bernard Russ were already in street
clothes along with other walking wounded, so the Patriots were
forced to put their two best defensive backs _ Milloy and Law _ on
special teams. That is not a place where you often want to see your
most productive defensive players, but after seeing their special
teams pulverized the last two Sundays reinforcements were required
and the call went out.
</P>
<P>
   When it did a $50 million cornerback and a soon-to-be
million-dollar safety answered with abandon, which is the only way
to answer such a plea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their attitude about it was terrific,'' coach Pete Carroll
said. ``They didn't hesitate.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither did Whigham or Milloy when they were told they would be
playing linebacker in the second half after first Moore and then
Crawford went down with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Milloy weighs 208 pounds yet found himself staring into the eyes
of offensive guards who weighed 287 and 281 pounds, respectively.
Not far away the 205-pound Whigham was holding the fort at the
plugger position normally played by Bruschi, staying on the edge of
the defense as often as his coaches could keep him there, but still
forced to blitz and play the run far more often than a backup
safety would think wise under normal circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a defensive back used to wide receivers releasing on me,
not 300-pound linemen,'' Whigham said. ``I got one nice hit in, but
that's why my neck hurts. We called a lot of blitzes and base
defenses so I didn't have to sit up on their guards but
unfortunatley (linebacker Andy) Katzenmoyer made one wrong call and
I had to go up in there. I proved I'm no linebacker on that play,
but you have to be willing and able to do anything they ask of you.
They drew it up for me and coach (Steve) Sidwell made some calls to
get me to the outside.''
</P>
<P>
   He also made some calls that left Milloy in the middle, a spot
he is not unfamiliar with, but one that is different from when he
is asked to creep up from his safety position to add extra bodies
at the line of scrimmage. Such exotic blitzes were no longer a part
of New England's defensive scheme once their linebackers went to
the infirmary, so something else had to be done and someone had to
do it.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a team, somebody does. If you are a collection of
disparate parts, nobody does. Sunday the scoreboard read ``New
England 24, Denver 23.'' The winners write history. The winners
were a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Vernon and Marty went down it was hard to imagine how we
were going to paste it together,'' Carroll said. ``Tons of things
were gone. I'd say 95 percent of what we normally do on defense was
gone. I liked it because we were really having to coach them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to draw things up in the dirt a little bit. As a coach,
you like that. We had to be resourceful and we were. And those guys
had to play. We were just fighting every play.''
</P>
<P>
   And they did. They fought not like classic linebackers, but like
street fighters, playing well enough for long enough to hold off a
Bronco team whose running game resurfaced (133 yards and 4.9 yards
a carry) and whose young quarterback (Brian Griese) blossomed,
going 25 of 38 for 316 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Played well enough to win.
</P>
<P>
   As a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a little bit of confusion at times but we pulled
together,'' Milloy said after making a game-high 14 tackles. ``If
we hadn't had so much adversity with injuries last year and with
our special teams this year it would have been more of a hostile
environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sidwell kept it simple for somebody who hadn't lined up at
those positions. We couldn't blitz like we usually do. We had to
stay in base defenses. Our scheme is so vast we couldn't do a lot
of the things we normally do, because we had players on the field
who had never played their positions before. But we were scrappy
out there. Nobody griped.''
</P>
<P>
   They just played football.
</P>
<P>
   Like a team.

</P>
<P>
   Here is a (partial) list of objects that Martha Stewart has
gilded on recent TV shows: pomegranates, pumpkins, cookies,
chocolate truffles, wrapping paper, oak leaves, acorns, and--no
kidding--okra. The only thing Martha has not gilded is the lily.
But wait till it's back in season.
</P>
<P>
   Martha has proved that alchemy is not impossible: Brush enough
gold paint on enough flora, and eventually you'll make real gold.
Last Tuesday's initial public offering for Martha Stewart Living
Omnimedia--Omnimedia, has there ever been a more perfect
name?--killed on Wall Street, rising from $18 to $52 before
settling at $36.
</P>
<P>
   She arrived at the stock exchange that morning toting a tray of
brioches. She left that evening holding $1.2 billion (in stock, not
dough).
</P>
<P>
   Investors bought a brilliant company: Omnimedia--a Web site,
mail-order operation, two TV shows, two magazines, Kmart
partnership, and 27 books--netted $24 million last year from the
gospel of Martha. Kmart sold more than $750 million worth of
Martha-branded products in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Her 1997 decision to divorce Time Warner and go solo--a split
that cost her more than $50 million--has never looked better.
</P>
<P>
   What was missing from Martha's IPO was the sniping and mockery
that has dogged all of her ventures. Traditionally, Martha has been
battered by three criticisms. First, she is simply ludicrous. You
could not imagine better comic material than her ideas of
``living'': the ``midnight omelet dinner for 1,000''; the fruit
baskets the size of a Chevy; the advice (in this month's magazine)
to make your own envelopes out of wood veneer, folding them with a
bone knife.
</P>
<P>
   Parodies barely exaggerate when they imagine Martha turning
water into wine (''a lovely Merlot'') or manufacturing condoms from
her own lamb.
</P>
<P>
   A second and more thoughtful batch of critics has charged her
with encouraging class division, promoting soulless domestic
conformism, and undermining working women by making them feel
domestically inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   The final criticism has been personal. As her unauthorized
biography, ``Just Desserts,'' contends, Martha is an icy, horrible
person who abused her (now ex-) husband, ignores her daughter,
belittles her mother, sues her gardener for pennies, plagiarizes
recipes from better cooks, and humiliates her staff. Her fabled
``Remembering'' columns are a hash of bunkum and hyperbole. The
persona she cultivates--the warm, welcoming hostess with a
close-knit family--is a fraud.
</P>
<P>
   These criticisms have subsided partly because of America's
culture of financial idolatry. Anyone who's worth a billion on
paper is worth sucking up to.
</P>
<P>
   Martha is benefiting from parody fatigue as well. She has been a
figure of fun since ``Entertaining'' was published in 1982, so all
the jokes are old.
</P>
<P>
   And the vitality of the economy is inoculating her. Fripperies
that seemed obscene during the early '90s recession are quite
modest by the standards of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But the critical silence may also represent a long-overdue
recognition that Martha is, as she would say, a Good Thing. In a
Tuesday TV interview, she called herself a ``teacher. ... We are
offering information, high-quality, well-researched, how-to
information.'' That is a fair description.
</P>
<P>
   What she does is not silly at all, or at least no more silly
than most advice magazines. Her magazines and TV shows retain just
enough nonsense to make them irksome (''sew your own pashmina from
home-raised llamas,'' and the like), but she supplies valuable
instruction about the mundane tasks of life.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Stewart Living may be the most useful magazine this side
of Consumer Reports. This month's issue, for example, offers
excellent advice about making spicy popcorn snacks, cleaning ovens,
and storing rugs and china, among other subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Her weekly CBS morning segment packs more helpful cooking
information into six minutes than most cooking shows do in an hour.
</P>
<P>
   It is not false consciousness that makes tens of millions of
people follow Martha every month. It is her good advice.
</P>
<P>
   But the great achievement of Martha's domestic gospel is not
practical but moral. She has a puritanical sensibility. She
believes in the uplifting power of work. She instructs you so that
you will know how to create objects yourself, grow plants yourself,
learn home repair yourself, cook food yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Doing something well is good and liberating and fulfilling. It
strengthens friendships and families: When I saw her making waffles
the other day, it made me want to make waffles this Sunday. If I
make waffles on Sunday, I will invite the downstairs neighbors up
to eat them, and that is undoubtedly a Good Thing.
</P>
<P>
   Martha practices materialism, but not consumerism. She believes,
rightly, that it makes you wiser and happier to cook your own
applesauce than to buy it. Well, you may say, it's easy for her to
make homemade applesauce. That's her job. But she did it when it
wasn't h too.
</P>
<P>
   Even if most viewers rarely practice anything Martha
preaches--she calls such slackers ``Martha Dreamers'' as opposed to
``Martha Doers''--she is still a worthy goad.
</P>
<P>
   Her DIY credo makes Martha democratically snobbish. She hews to
a country-house sensibility, but anyone can follow it. It doesn't
cost much, because you do it yourself. If a middle-class Polish
girl like Martha can blossom into an affected, Breck-girl
faux-WASP, you can too!
</P>
<P>
   The final, and most important, reason Martha is escaping
criticism is that Martha Stewart the person has been separated from
Martha Stewart the brand. The principal topic of discussion about
the Martha Stewart Living IPO was Martha Stewart's death. Analysts
speculated what would happen to Omnimedia if Martha were hit by a
bus or cab (or succumbed to an accident in ``the potting shed,'' as
the New York Observer's Christopher Byron nicely put it).
</P>
<P>
   There were two answers: First, the company has bought a $67
million life-insurance policy on her. Second, Martha Stewart the
brand can survive without Martha Stewart the person, as Ralph
Lauren the brand survives without Ralph Lauren selling every shirt.
(Martha does not appear at all in the current issue of Living.) The
zooming stock price is evidence that Wall Street can distinguish
Martha from her product.
</P>
<P>
   We should do the same. Critics have savaged her fraudulent
persona and monomaniacal perfectionism for a long time. There is a
subtle sexism in that: The female domestic tycoon is obliged to
behave better than the guys. (This is why Oprah's private life is
examined more carefully than David Letterman's.)
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, commerce has trumped personality. Martha is finally
being treated as the CEO of a company called Omnimedia, not as a
bitchy hausfrau. In the age of the divine entrepreneur, no one
cares how badly you treat your kid. We admire perfectionist
monomania in Internet tycoons, so why not in Martha? Politicians
get away with advertising bogus family bliss; Martha should too.
</P>
<P>
   On television, Martha shows us how to make a romantic dinner for
the husband she doesn't have, host a party for the kids she doesn't
like, bake muffins for the neighbors who hate her.
</P>
<P>
   But those are her tragedies, not our business (or Wall
Street's). The muffins are still tasty, and that's what matters.

   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ First the happy tidings, that the Patriots
finally beat Denver, and, as Chris Slade put it, ``This was not
only a big one for us because we needed it bad, but it was a big
one for all the guys who never beat them . . . the Andre Tippetts,
the Bruce Armstrongs, the Ben Coateses, and myself.''
</P>
<P>
   And seldom has the long-suffering Armstrong been happier,
because not only did the Patriots run the ball, but Armstrong also
put a supreme push on the Broncos' Bill Romanowski on Terry Allen's
1-yard TD run in the third quarter Sunday. Armstrong drove the
linebacker a yard or so into the end zone, allowing Allen to score
easily. Sights rarely seen the last decade in Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   Fitting enough that Drew Bledsoe gave Armstrong the ball he had
carried off the field after the quarterback's last taking of a knee
that ran out the clock because the offensive line, much maligned,
had produced. The lesson? ``You have to slug it out and then slug
it our some more,'' said Armstrong. ``You can't rush the ball if
you don't have the attempts.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the unhappy tidings. The offensive line produced, but the
offense did not. The offense never had a drive of more than seven
plays, and for the third straight week could not come through when
the team had a good lead and one more score would have sealed the
issue. And once again, it was left to the defense to save a tight
game. ``We may not be playing the best football in the league right
now,'' said wide receiver Shawn Jefferson, ``and we're also not
playing the ugliest football, either. But it's good that we're 5-2
when we know we can play better.''
</P>
<P>
   True, as Jefferson said, ``the guys on the other side of the
ball are being paid, too,'' and the Broncos, now 2-5, were
desperate. The Super Bowl champs had to win the game.
</P>
<P>
   That said, how the Patriots' offense played after gaining a
24-13 lead in the third quarter, after the defense had forced
Denver quarterback Brian Griese into a three-and-out with 6:47 left
in the quarter, when all the momentum was with New England, was not
good. Three times the offense got the ball after the momentum was
theirs and Bledsoe and Co. could produce only two first downs.
Points seemed out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can only take what the defense gives us,'' said Jefferson
of how the Broncos' all-out blitzing in the second half stymied the
Patriots. Or, as Armstrong put it when asked if the offense still
needs to find that put-'em-away attitude, ``We may have to learn
that we can run the ball on first down and run the ball on second
down, but we can get first downs by running on third downs, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most disconcerting is how opposing defenses now come
with all-out blitzes and the Patriots seldom make the other team
pay.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the game, Bledsoe was sacked on a blitz ``and Drew
said he held onto the ball too long,'' said Armstrong. ``It's not
our philosophy to throw the ball away or to run with the ball,'' he
explained. But it was late in the game, when the Patriots had the
lead and twice had third-down situations to wind down the clock,
that the offense did not come through. The last of those came with
3 1/2 minutes left, the Patriots with the ball on the Broncos' 38,
facing third and 4.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots called for maximum protection with eight blockers
and Vincent Brisby on the left and Terry Glenn on the right. Brisby
recalled the Broncos ``came with an all-out blitz of eight guys.''
Armstrong remembered, ``it was an all-or-nothing blitz and they
brought nine guys. It's all or nothing. There's little you can do
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But once upon a time in football, receivers would
recognize all-out blitzes and adjust their routes to the open
spaces left by the blitzers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The receivers stayed in their routes on the play,'' said
Brisby. He broke to the left sideline on his medium route and Glenn
broke to the right sideline; the middle of the field was completely
open. Bledsoe was on his back before the receivers had completed
their routes.
</P>
<P>
   And the defense, for the third week in a row, was forced to save
what the offense could not. Once again, the Patriots could not make
the opposing defense pay for blitzing, even though the pass
protection was better than adequate. ``When they came after us with
a full blitz,'' said coach Pete Carroll, ``we had to get rid of the
football and we didn't get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 5-2 and our best football is ahead of us,'' said
Jefferson. And making opponents pay for blitzing hopefully is also
ahead for the Patriot offense.

FAULK SAW OPENING, TOOK IT

<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Kevin Faulk had to break through a few
traffic jams at the line of scrimmage Sunday. But when it came to
his first touchdown as a pro, he compared the 15 yards between
himself and the Denver goal line to your local driving range.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it looked like a golf shot, wide open,'' said a smiling
Faulk, describing the swath of green on the right side that he
skipped through untouched at 7:27 of the first quarter. The
touchdown got the Patriots off on the right foot in their 24-23
victory over Denver.
</P>
<P>
   It was a victory that was fashioned in large part by what
Patriots coach Pete Carroll called his ``1-2'' running backs punch,
Faulk and veteran Terry Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Faulk, who had missed two full games and part of another because
of an ankle injury, had five carries for 24 yards and 210 return
yards that gave the Patriots good field position.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, who had to leave the game in the fourth quarter with a
concussion, had his first 100-yard game with the Patriots, gaining
106 yards on 17 carries with a pair of rushing scores.
</P>
<P>
   New England's 133 yards rushing complemented the 214 yards
passing by quarterback Drew Bledsoe, who appreciated the
contribution of his running backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real benefit to our offense if we can have that kind of
balance,'' said Bledsoe. ``It makes things much easier for me. And
it makes things much easier for our passing game. We can mix it up
a little bit. Hopefully that will be a trend that we can
continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe praised Allen for running hard and breaking tackles and
Faulk for his all-around effort, on special teams and in the
backfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (Allen) can come back from the concussion, we'll continue
to have that 1-2 punch that gives us two different looks,'' Bledsoe
said.
</P>
<P>
   After the Broncos held Green Bay to 21 yards on the ground a
week earlier, Carroll realized the urgency of showing more than one
dimension to Denver. He said the offensive line and running backs
had their best game of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the numbers wound up, but I'm sure we had
more than 5 yards a carry (actually 4.8) against a very good
rushing defense,'' he said. ``The line needed a little boost and we
need to see if we can keep it going.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time we've had Kevin and Terry at the same
time when they've both been ready to go full speed and both guys
were effective. Terry ran very tough and Kevin was real quick.
Kevin was a big factor in the field-position aspect of this game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the first time we've seen that 1-2 punch. We've been
talking about it since the end of camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulk, who gave credit to the line, said that while there's
still room for improvement, Sunday was a breakthrough for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming into the game, we had hoped to get 4 yards no matter
what the play or the blocking was,'' said Faulk. ``Whatever I have
to do to help the team, I'll do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting 4 yards every time we ran the ball feels great. Terry
showed what he's been doing for nine years, and I feel I can give
100 percent even though my ankle is about 85 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulk has been urged by his coaches to run more ``downhill,'' as
he phrased it, but he couldn't help but go right and then home free
on his touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just reaction,'' he said. ``The defense had a stunt on.
I spotted it, got a block, and went outside. I could have run for
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a week would be fine with Carroll, if Faulk continues to
run like he did Sunday.

   SCI-ANTARCTIC-ICE (Undated) _ Radar pictures of Antarctica
released last week contain clues collected by a Canadian-American
satellite expected to help in forecasting the fate of low-lying
parts of the world, including Bangladesh, the Netherlands and New
York City. Environmentalists are keenly interested in Antarctica
because of the possibility that some of its gigantic ice cap, which
contains about 90 percent of the world's ice, could slide into the
sea. If just part of the ice cap _ the West Antarctic Ice Sheet _
should do this, global sea level would swiftly rise by about 17
feet, inundating coastal regions everywhere with catastrophic
consequences for humanity. By Malcolm W. Browne.

   SCI-BRAZIL-SKULL (Rio de Janeiro) _ A human skull at the
National Museum of Brazil here has been attracting crowds and
controversy in equal measure since it was unveiled this month.
After two decades in storage, the skull has now been identified as
the oldest human remains ever recovered in the Western Hemisphere.
The skull is that of a young woman believed to have roamed the
savannah of south-central Brazil some 11,500 years ago. A
reconstruction of her cranium indicates that her features are
negroid rather than mongoloid, suggesting that the New World may
have initially been settled not only earlier than thought, but by a
people distinct from the ancestors of today's Amerindians. By Larry
Rohter. (1400 words)

   SCI-BRAIN (Undated) _ A highly respected neuroscientist has
developed a provocative new theory of how the brain is organized
which, if confirmed, would explain how and why the mind produces
symptoms found in several seemingly unrelated disorders. According
to the theory, the deep sadness in severe depression, the hand
wringing in obsessive compulsive disorder, the ringing in the ears
of tinnitus, the unrelenting discomfort of chronic pain and the
shaking and immobility seen Parkinson's disease all stem from the
same basic brain defect _ a decoupling of two brain regions that
normally fire their cells in synchrony. By Sandra Blakeslee. (1000

generation of gamma ray observatories coming into operation now,
astronomers say that the party is just beginning. By James Glanz.

<P>
   SCI-BLACK-HOLES (Undated) _ A new calculation suggests that
dense star clusters, which are sprinkled throughout galaxies in
Earth's cosmic neighborhood, act as assembly lines for tightly
orbiting pairs of black holes and then spit them out of the
cluster. There, they eventually fall together and merge into one.
Next year, if all goes well, scientists will be able to take the
first steps toward testing that theory with a new $350 million
instrument called a gravity wave observatory. By James Glanz. (1200

   SCI-GENOME-RACE (Rockville, Md.) _ The two rival teams racing to
decode the human genome have each neared or passed important
milestones. Biologists hope a completed genetic sequence will lay
the basis for virtually all diseases to be understood, and with
luck treated, in terms of the specific genes or genetic defects
that are involved. By Nicholas Wade. (1500 words)

rhythm. Often, the first clue that something is wrong with the way
the heart beats is sudden cardiac death. By Jane E. Brody. (1280

</P>
<P>
   SCI-HOSPITAL-RISK (Undated) _ An essay. Hospitals may not be
called pest houses anymore, but they are still terrible places to
be sick. They are all crawling with bacteria, with strangers who
are sometimes kindly but sometimes not, with the potential for bad
accidents; hospitals assault the senses from every direction, and
then they send a bill. No, from time immemorial it has always been
far better, if possible, to be sick at home, surrounded by familiar
comforts and tended by a devoted relative or friend. An essay by
Abigail Zuger, M.D. (1050 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-OVARY (New York) _ In an experimental operation last
Thursday that one doctor called ``great work'' but another called
``preposterous,'' surgeons in Brooklyn removed a woman's ovaries,
sliced them into thin strips and implanted them into her arm. The
patient, in her 30s, had cervical cancer, and the reason for the
seemingly outlandish procedure was to protect her ovaries from
radiation treatment planned for the cancer. By Denise Grady. (1400

</P>
<P>
   _ Anesthesiologists, like many doctors, tend to be wary of
herbal medicines. But now anesthesiologists have begun turning to
an herb to help treat a deadly and often intractable lung condition
that affects hundreds of thousands of people a year. The herb is
borage, valued until now mainly for its slightly cucumberish taste

   _ Despite renewed efforts across the country to educate
teen-agers about sex and repercussions like pregnancy and disease,
many young people say they still need more information about the

NOT THE MOST FLATTERING PROFILE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Patriots beat the Broncos by a point
Sunday. Their win at Foxboro Stadium wasn't ensured until Jason
Elam missed a 59-yard field goal with 1:45 remaining. If you have a
problem with either of those statements, you don't know New
England's pro football team as well as you think you do.
</P>
<P>
   To understand the 5-2 Patriots a little better, please refer to
this quick profile:
</P>
<P>
   If the typical Patriot has an electric bill due on the first of
the month, he will certainly pay it on the first _ about 60 seconds
before midnight. He won't be late for your lunch date, but he won't
be early. He is in his seat for the feature presentation, but he
never has seen a preview. One of the most insulting things you can
say to him is, ``Let's go for a walk and look at the trees.'' What?
That's too easy. How about finding a very tall tree and bungee
jumping instead?
</P>
<P>
   Here's a guarantee: You will fall in love with the Patriots (if
you're not there already). You will fall for them because they
always will make the ordinary seem interesting. But, because of
that love, your life will not be easy. The Patriots have won four
games by a total of 8 points and another by 12. That 12-pointer
came over the 0-7 Cleveland Browns, who lost by 31 points Sunday.
The Patriots have lost twice, by a total of 3 points. They've got
problems, but being dull isn't one of them. One day they will crush
a team by 30 points. Even that will be exciting or vexing,
depending on whom you ask.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Patriots hadn't beaten the Broncos since 1980, they
had a blowout framed for them Sunday. They had a 24-13 lead in the
third quarter and were running the ball well. They had a lead on
the Broncos who, despite what you hear, are not a good team. Terry
Allen had two touchdowns through three quarters, the first Patriot
runner to do that since Curtis Martin did it three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   So if they kept running, they would win, right? Of course not.
As Bill Parcells and Drew Bledsoe have said, you are what the
profile says you are.
</P>
<P>
   Allen couldn't finish the game because of a concussion, so the
running game stopped. Two linebackers were injured, meaning that a
backup defensive back (205-pound Larry Whigham) had to play their
positions. Chris Slade was called for roughing the passer. Steve
Israel was called for pass interference. Twice.
</P>
<P>
   A touchdown and a field goal later, it was a 24-23 game. That
score didn't become official until Elam's miss. You don't see guys
making 59-yarders often, but any Patriot would be lying if he said
he wasn't worried about the kick.
</P>
<P>
   ``This 1-point thing, it's here (to stay), I guess,'' New
England coach Pete Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   Even that comment wasn't delivered easily. The Patriots hold
Carroll's press conferences in a weight room. So when the coach
speaks to his audience, he has to peek between squatting machines,
benches, bars, and 50-pound barbells to find the people with the
queries. (Related note: The Patriots are also one of the few NFL
teams that have to drive between the locker room and practice
field. If you didn't know these Patriots so well, you might think
their commute was a little strange.)
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 60,011 fans left the stadium, cornerback Ty Law
said the Patriots will critique each other in Monday's meetings.
Criticism is good, especially when it comes from your colleagues,
but there are certain things that cannot change. One of them is
what most fans refer to as an ``annoying'' zone defense on third
down. As much as I hate zones, I have to admit that the zone has to
stay for the Patriots. Law would love to play straight-up on his
man. Israel is able to do the same. But when teams spread out the
field with additional receivers and Whigham and Kato Serwanga enter
the game, playing a zone is much better than the alternative, which
is using backups in one-on-one coverage. The Patriots might like
living dangerously, but they aren't crazy.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the Broncos' comeback Sunday was expected. With
their injuries, the Patriots were limited to their most basic
defense. And, really, when was the last time you saw a 205-pound
linebacker in the NFL? It was probably the same year of the
Patriots' previous win over the Broncos. They were simply trying to
hold on and prevent Denver from doing what Miami had done a week
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were celebrating in the other room,'' Law said of the
Dolphins, who left with a 31-30 win. ``That ticked us off, how they
came into our house and celebrated. We can't let that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   On some Sunday afternoon, Bruce Armstrong said, he would love to
stand on the sideline in the third quarter, relaxing because his
team has a four- or five-touchdown lead. Israel said the Patriots
need to blow a team out. Law said ``it's a shame'' that games
continue to be settled in the final minute or two. Armstrong says
all the bizarre finishes will change when the team matures. Maybe
we will start to see some of that maturity after the off week.
</P>
<P>
   Before that comes, there is a game next week in Arizona against
the Cardinals. You would think that it will be an easy one,
especially since quarterback Jake Plummer will not play. The
Patriots will win, because they win more often than they lose. But
you have read the profile of the typical Patriot. An easy win? You
know better.

BRONCOS YOUNGSTERS HAVE GROWING PAINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN VELLANTE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Second-year quarterback Brian Griese admits
he's sick and tired of learning on the job.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to win and he wants to win now.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie running back Olandis Gary echoes similar sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronco youngsters turned in credible performances Sunday,
but rather than talk about their growing maturity in the NFL, they
groused about missed opportunities in Denver's 24-23 loss to the
Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm upset,'' said Griese, who completed 25 of 38 passes for
316 yards and one touchdown, and also ran for another score. ``When
we got the ball with three minutes left on the 20-yard line I had
no doubt that we would go down and score at least a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had four of these (losses) before and I'm getting tired
of them. I don't want to learn anymore. I want to win. Sure, I'm
going to take a lot of things from this game and learn from them,
but that's not the way I want to learn. I want to learn and win at
the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I judge myself, and I'll say this to the day I die, on whether
we win the game or not, and ultimately that's what matters. We
didn't win, I didn't win, so anything I did doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not to him, but it did to Broncos coach Mike Shanahan, who
slowly but surely is being vindicated for his decision to start
Griese over veteran Bubby Brister.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played well and with a lot of poise,'' said Shanahan. ``I
don't know what his percentages were, the yardage or anything like
that, but he played well under a lot of pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Broncos got the ball with 3:15 left in the game, the
stage was set for Griese and Denver to win for the third straight
time after opening the season with four straight losses.
</P>
<P>
   Griese's passing, Gary's running, and two key Patriot penalties
helped move the ball from Denver's 20 to the New England 40 before
Griese misfired on a third-down pass to Rod Smith. That set up
Jason Elam's 59-yard field goal try that was straight but way
short.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rod would have caught the ball, but I think it was tipped,''
said Griese. ``We wanted to at least get to the 35. But the great
teams and the great players find a way to make that play and I
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary, who was thrust into the offensive mix when Terrell Davis
went down in Week 4 with a torn ACL, had his biggest day as a
professional last week when he gained 124 yards on 37 carries
against Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday against the Patriots, he gained 90 yards on 19 rushes,
including a 60-yarder he nearly broke for a touchdown. He also
caught four passes for 39 yards.
</P>
<P>
   On the long run off left tackle, on which he was caught from
behind by Chris Carter, Gary said, ``Those guys get paid to stop me
and I get paid to try and get (in the end zone). Unfortunately, I
didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it was my inexperience, maybe it wasn't. I don't know.
All I know is the learning process is taking a long time and the
losses keep piling up.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan is just as pleased with Gary's progression as he is
with Griese's.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made some big plays out there and he ran hard,'' said
Shanahan. ``He had that big run. I was impressed with the way he
played. He's a tough, hard-nosed player, and in a tough situation
he's responded well.''

YANKEES DOUBLE THE FUN 
</HEADLINE>
 SERIES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's fear and frost on Peachtree Street. But in New
York they're already warming up the floats for another ticker-tape
parade down the Canyon of Heroes for a celebration that even Joe
Mooney's tarp-happy grounds crew won't be allowed to cut short.
</P>
<P>
   As everything touched by Atlanta Braves manager Bobby Cox
continued to turn to ashes in a 7-2 loss Sunday &UR;  &LR; night in Game 2 of
the 95th World Series, the New York Yankees moved within two games
of lighting some fin de siecle victory cigars.
</P>
<P>
   At this rate, Rocket Roger Clemens will have a chance to fulfill
his personal wish list by closing out the Series in the Bronx
Wednesday night, and giving the Yankees consecutive sweeps of the
National League champs.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego Padres were last year's four-and-out victims, and
the Braves were headed down that same dead end after a night in
which Cox rattled his lineup card in hopes of producing more
offense. The Braves, who had two hits in Game 1, had one through
seven innings against David Cone. Cox's nominees to prop up the
bats mostly contributed some more trap-door defense, the kind that
led to Atlanta's demise in Game 1, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees ground Braves starter Kevin Millwood into sawdust
with five singles and three runs in the first inning, then swept
him aside three batters into the third. Singles by Bernie Williams
and Tino Martinez and a double by Ricky Ledee made it 4-0 and led
to Millwood's departure, the earliest by a Braves starter in the
World Series since Milwaukee's Bob Buhl was ousted two outs into
Game 3 of 1957.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just think in small bits and bytes,'' said Yankees manager
Joe Torre, alluding to the Yankees' total of 14 hits (11 singles, 3
doubles). ``Because that's what we need to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``But pitching sets the tone, and David Cone was terrific
tonight. I was worried about him in Boston, because he hadn't
pitched in about 12 days, but I didn't worry about him tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Millwood, remember, originally was penciled in to start Game 3
in New York, but Cox's master plan was undone by the flu bug that
felled Tom Glavine, who was supposed to have pitched the Series
opener but now will be asked to stanch the bleeding Tuesday night
in Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees made it 5-0 when shortstop Ozzie Guillen, who had
replaced Game 1 starter Walt Weiss, muffed Cone's soft liner, the
ball ticking off his glove as Martinez scored.
</P>
<P>
   An inning later, second baseman Keith Lockhart, Cox's choice to
sub for Bret Boone, threw away a double-play relay, allowing Derek
Jeter, who had opened the fourth with a double, to score.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees opened a seven-run advantage in the fifth. Scott
Brosius, who has five hits in two games in an encore to last year's
Series MVP performance, doubled, took third on Joe Girardi's
sacrifice, and scored on a single by Chuck Knoblauch, who had led
off the game with the first of three straight Yankee singles.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the first seven hitters in the Yankees' order had at
least two hits, with Williams singling three times.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch's first-inning hit was followed by hits by Jeter and
Paul O'Neill to make it 1-0. Millwood looked like he might escape
further trouble when Williams hit into a double play, but Martinez
delivered a two-out RBI hit. After a walk to Ledee, Brosius hit a
2-and-2 pitch up the middle for another RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, meanwhile, were as helpless against Cone as they'd
been the night before against El Duque, Orlando Hernandez. Cone
threw away Guillen's bunt for a two-base error in the first, and
admitted he escaped a bullet when Brian Jordan's drive died on the
track in left.
</P>
<P>
   ``A warmer night, and that's a home run,'' said Cone, small
comfort to Jordan, the cleanup man who is 0 for 7 in this series,
as is Ryan Klesko, the man who hits behind him. ``That might have
taken something out of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone did not allow a hit until Greg Myers, catching in place of
sore-fingered Eddie Perez, opened the fifth with a line single to
center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played a bad game,'' manager Bobby Cox said. ``We're a team
of good pitching and timely hitting, and we didn't get any runners
on to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta did not advance a runner to third until the seventh,
when Cone walked Jordan and Lockhart and Jordan took third on
Myers's fly ball. But Cone caught Andruw Jones looking at a called
third strike to end his night's labors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think a good-moving fastball is the best pitch in
baseball,'' Cox said, ``and Cone had a good one tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the praise directed at the Braves' pitching this decade,
Yankees pitching has dominated Atlanta's ever since Game 4 of the
'96 Series, the one turned around by Jim Leyritz's crushing
three-run home run off Mark Wohlers.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves did not score in the last five innings of that game,
were shut out the next night in Game 5, and scored just two runs in
the '96 Series finale. With just three runs in two games here _
Chipper Jones's solo home run in Game 1 and two runs with two outs
in the bottom of the ninth Sunday &UR;  &LR; night _ the Braves have scored
just five runs in their last 40 innings against the Bombers in
Series play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating,'' Cox said. ``I don't know if it's helpless.
We just kept waiting to get something going.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-five times in Series history, a team has won the first two
games. Thirty-four of those teams have gone on to win the Series,
including seven of the last eight. The only exception? The '96
Braves, who won the first two in New York, then lost four straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question we're aware of what happened in '96,''
Torre said, ``and what we did to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The last three teams to win the first two Series games on the
road went on to lose the Series _ the '85 Cardinals, the '86 Red
Sox, and the '96 Braves.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are now 9-1 this postseason, including their
five-game conquest of the Red Sox in the ALCS, which ended with the
Fenway Park grounds crew trying to lay down the tarp on the mound
while the Yanks were still gathered in a group clinch.
</P>
<P>
   These Yankees also have won 10 straight in the World Series. The
Yankees of DiMaggio and Dickey won 10 in a row in a stretch from
1937 to '41. The Yankees of Ruth and Gehrig won a record 12
straight, from 1927, the year the Babe hit 60, to 1932, when the
Babe was said to have called his shot against the Cubs in a
four-game sweep.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just don't expect to do that this time of year against
great teams,'' Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a tribute to our starting pitching and (closer)
Mariano Rivera. When we've gotten a lead, he's been automatic.''

BRUINS SHOW MORE PLUCK THAN DUCKS 
</HEADLINE>
 DUCKS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ When the Bruins embarked on this six-game road
trip, coach Pat Burns said he would be happy with breaking even.
</P>
<P>
   After the club hadn't won in its first nine games (tying a
franchise-worst start) and was 0-2-2 on the journey, it appeared
.500 was a pipe dream at best.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference two days make. The Bruins beat the San Jose
Sharks Saturday night, and less than 24 hours later wrapped up the
trip with a 3-2 victory over the Mighty Ducks at Arrowhead Pond.
</P>
<P>
   The team heads home from its strange odyssey with a 2-2-2 mark
and the players' moods elevated 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   John Grahame picked up his first victory of the year Saturday
and Sunday &UR;  &LR; night it was Rob Tallas's turn as he stopped 29 shots
(12 in the third period) for his first win.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to go,'' said Burns of Tallas, adding that it
would've been tough on Grahame to come back after such a big high
on Saturday. ``Robbie did a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins picked up right where they left off in San Jose. They
jumped to a 2-0 lead after 20 minutes and never looked back. Sergei
Samsonov, who has looked remarkably more comfortable in the last
few games than he did in the first few, made a stunning move that
led to the first goal.
</P>
<P>
   Skating from his own end, Samsonov snaked through the neutral
zone and ended up in the right circle. He faked defenseman Kevin
Haller one way and then feathered a pass to himself between
Haller's skates. He picked it up on the inside and flipped a high
forehand shot into the top right corner past the glove of goalie
Guy Hebert at 3:48.
</P>
<P>
   Where the Bruins had been so successful on the power play
against the Sharks, it was at even strength that Boston shined
Sunday &UR;  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Andreychuk, who has been a steady contributor and calming
influence during the slow start, tallied his fifth goal of the year
to put the Bruins ahead, 2-0, at 16:29.
</P>
<P>
   Teemu Selanne tried to clear the puck out of the defensive zone
but it was batted down by Jason Allison. Allison whacked at it and
eventually got it over to Anson Carter. Carter found Andreychuk in
the slot and the big left wing's quick shot beat Hebert to the
glove side.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins made it a three-goal cushion at 13:21 of the second
when slumping forward Steve Heinze, who had been demoted to the
fourth line the past couple of games, scored his second of the year
during a power play. Heinze said being dropped to the fourth line
actually gave him a boost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being put on the fourth line takes the pressure off,'' he
said. ``All of a sudden, I can just go out and play. I can be my
own worst enemy. I'm on the first or second line or the first or
second power play, and I think, `I've got to score.' I can't do
that. I have to just play. It was a good coach's decision and maybe
it's something I needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Neilsen was already in the penalty box for interference on
Tallas when the Ducks' Oleg Tverdovsky high-sticked Samsonov in the
face at 12:07. That infraction, a four-minute minor, created a big
gash in Samsonov's lower lip and the impact caused him to bite his
tongue. Both wounds, with the tongue being the worst of the two,
required stitches and he was unable to return.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had a two-man advantage for 26 seconds and despite
two Ray Bourque blasts from the point were denied at first. When
Boston began skating five on four, Heinze took advantage. Allison
started the play by throwing the puck behind him along the
left-wing boards. Andreychuk corraled it down deep and found Heinze
in the slot. Heinze switched from his forehand to his backhand and
returned to his forehand as Hebert came out. He slipped the puck
behind the netminder to the glove side and the Bruins were ahead,
3-0, at 13:21.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Cullen spoiled Tallas's shutout bid at 12:06 of the third
period with his third goal of the season. The Ducks made it close
when Tverdovsky beat Tallas with 1:12 in regulation but the Bruins
held on.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't have wanted another 10 minutes left,'' said
Burns. ``I think we were starting to fade a little bit with the
game (Saturday) and the (earlier) start tonight. But we handled it
pretty good.''

CHAFEE REPRESENTED BEST OF NONPARTISAN TRADITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ John Chafee did it the right way. Pat Buchanan is
doing it the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   The coincidence of one wonderful man's death and another guy's
birth as a third-party presidential candidate is just that. But it
is a useful window on a value most Americans have always found
appealing _ transcending the rat-a-tat-tat of two-party politics.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to oversimplify this, but from the first stirrings of
this country that value has had two antagonistic manifestations. In
one of them, the parties are conspirators, compromising the best
interests of ordinary Americans to protect a status quo that favors
big shots. Or, they can be the glue of gridlock, so in the grip of
their dominant interests as to block actions that the people want.
Only a jolt from outside can shake up this system, and perhaps
there may be a moment when a new party is the answer.
</P>
<P>
   In the other manifestation, parties are vital means of
organizing elections that choose leaders and organize coalitions,
but are awful at the actual governance that is supposed to take
place between elections. To avoid permanent shouting matches,
responsible leaders in both parties need to come together to get
the people's business done. In fact, the lesson from most of our
history is that consensus is essential to taking big steps and that
it is by definition a coming together of big-thinking individuals
from each party. Chafee personified consensus-building leadership
that works and produces results. Buchanan picks at our scabs.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a tough-minded Yankee from Rhode Island who gave his
entire life to public service, the 1990s especially have been a
common-sense decade that have seen a resolution to shouting matches
over budget deficits and crime, public welfare and international
trade, the environment and higher education.
</P>
<P>
   Chafee's major regret involved health care. On this whopper, I
suspected that he was more right then wrong, as he organized
moderates in both parties for meetings every Thursday in his
office. Had President and Mrs. Clinton listened to him in 1993, his
attempts at consensus could have produced legislation that could
have become law, sparing us six years of drift. None of these
strides forward that Chafee was instrumental in making possible is
necessarily permanent. Each _ from internationalism to a humane
social contract _ involves an ongoing journey. And each is
vulnerable to the backsliders, in which company Buchanan stands
head and shoulders above the rest. Via the organization of
resentments, he threatens every gain Chafee helped achieve. It is
no accident that Buchanan's presidential career grew out of the
first of the decade's signal political achievements _ the
Democratic Congress's budget agreement with President Bush that
began a seven-year journey back to sanity; and its third-party
dimension begins this week as Clinton, with considerable Republican
backing, makes a fresh effort to bring China within the sensible
confines of the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The resentments he organizes are real, but to the resentful he
offers enemies to loathe instead of solutions to embrace. Buchanan
mistakes consensus for conspiracy, which is why one can only
imagine a significant vote for him by adding together various
pockets of fury.
</P>
<P>
   On his best day, he is the antitrade, antiabortion,
anti-immigration, anti-Education Department, antimultilateral
intervention, anti-civil rights consensus, antigun-control
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, instead of confronting his views, some Republicans
(George W. Bush being the most prominent) try coddling them. And
far too many Americans try to put gutter ideologies (anti-Semitism,
fascism, and racism) in Buchanan's mind-set that aren't there, and
play the worst kind of guilt-by-association games as well, to avoid
the more exacting task of countering his genuine appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that Buchanan is a divisive figure, but almost the
perfect foil for anyone diligent enough to advance the very causes
he fights. Buchanan offers literally the trifurcation of American
politics, since his great dream can only succeed if the country
splits three ways, and the 1000-1 odds of that happening are only
enhanced when Democrats and Republicans forget their own principles
and fight foolishly on his ground.
</P>
<P>
   John Chafee represented the best of our nonpartisan tradition,
which is in fact bipartisan. In contrast to Buchanan's apparent
nemesis in the Reform Party, Jesse Ventura, Chafee was a real
wrestler. That's the kind that isn't phony, but pits one grappler
against another for real. He happens to be in college wrestling's
Hall of Fame, one little-noted morsel from his Yale days which were
interupted by World War II, during which he was a Marine in places
like Guadalcanal.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing phony about his independent governing and
legislating, either. It takes a lot more mettle to move the ball
forward on health care in the Congress than it does to shout about
non-European immigrants on ``Crossfire.''
</P>
<P>
   No comparisons should be necessary, however. The fact is that
Chafee made a difference the hard way. Buchanan exploits our
differences the easy way.

PROFESSOR SAYS PUBLIC LOSING FAITH IN JUSTICE SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW BROWNSTEIN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. _ Nearly a decade of tabloid-friendly court
dramas, from the trial of William Kennedy Smith to that of William
Jefferson Clinton, have caused a massive decline in the public's
faith in the justice system, according to a study conducted by
Union College.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant professor Richard Fox's random survey of more than
1,000 respondents across the nation shows that 75 percent had less
confidence in the system following the murder trial of O.J.
Simpson, and 58 percent after the impeachment proceedings against
the president.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of these trials and others, as well as a dramatic
increase in mainstream media coverage of such cases, 44 percent of
the respondents said they felt less confident that the courts and
the police would treat them fairly.
</P>
<P>
   ``These stories are entertaining and build ratings, but the
troubling thing is that people are taking substantive meaning from
them,'' said Fox, 32, a professor of political science at the
college for four years. ``These cases should not be the vehicle for
public education about the legal system. They may be nothing more
than inflammatory.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, not every observer considers the consequences of
court coverage to be negative. Two specialists in law and media
ethics who were given summaries of Fox's study called the data
valuable, but gave his conclusions mixed reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe people should have less confidence in the system,'' said
Albany Law School professor Vincent Bonventre. ``I don't understand
why that's unhealthy. If there are warts in our system, is
ignorance of it going to increase our confidence?''
</P>
<P>
   Bonventre pointed to the 1995 murder trial of Simpson, which the
professor described as a lesson in race, police incompetence and
the way wealth affects the distribution of justice.
</P>
<P>
   But Aly Colon, an ethics instructor at the Poynter Institute for
Media Studies in St. Petersburg, Fla., said the journalistic pack
mentality can harm the public's ability to understand complex
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The news media can become so fixated with an event that it
gets reported ad nauseam, so much that people don't know why it's
being reported,'' he said. ``It's the information overload
syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   Though media and legal pundits have engaged in considerable
hand-wringing over the coverage of such cases, Fox's study _ which
was released earlier this month _ is believed to be the first to
examine comprehensively how public attitudes toward the law have
been shaped by the decade of scandal trials and court TV.
</P>
<P>
   Fox and co-author Robert Van Sickel of Purdue University in West
Lafayette, Ind., also claim to be the first to give evidentiary
support to claims that the mainstream news media have become
increasingly driven by tabloid-style stories. Their findings will
be detailed in the book ``Tabloid Justice,'' to be released by
Lynne Rienner next summer.
</P>
<P>
   For example, during the three years that led up to the
conviction of serial murderer Charles Manson in 1971, none of the
three major networks led with the story. By contrast, the Simpson
case held the lead position in roughly 100 news reports in
1994-'95, before his acquittal on criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sends the signal that that's one of the biggest news
stories in America,'' Fox said. ``You sort of wish we weren't
sending out that signal.'' Fox, a self-professed media junkie, said
he first began thinking of the book while channel surfing during
the Simpson trial.
</P>
<P>
   As a work of social science, the book is meant to pose
questions, Fox said, but not necessarily answer them. He admits to
being frustrated about the possibility for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market makes it difficult to think about real reform,'' he
said. ``Is one news organization going to stand on its high horse
and say, `We're not going to cover this while we go out of
business'? So we put our hands up in the end.''

GRITTY CHRONICLE OF THE END OF AN ERA

   &UR;  &LR; THE YARD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Building a Destroyer at the Bath Iron Works &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Michael S. Sanders &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HarperCollins, 253 pp., illustrated, $26 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In May 1997, the Bath Iron Works in Maine launched the USS
Donald Cook, the 463d ship completed since the shipyard was founded
in 1884, and the 25th in the Arleigh Burke class of guided-missile
destroyers.
</P>
<P>
   The building and launching of the Cook at the Bath yard occurred
without major surprise or mishap. But the very absence of problems
provided Michael S. Sanders with the opportunity _ one skillfully
realized _ to craft a vivid and richly detailed account of everyday
life and work in a blue-collar community and a hard-hat industry.
</P>
<P>
   And as more and more American workers move from jobs in which
they actually produce something to jobs where they manipulate
information, ``The Yard'' stands as a valuable documenting of what
``work'' meant to the millions of Americans who toiled before them.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, a writer and editor who lives in mid-coast Maine,
followed the building of the Cook from the first shaping of steel
sheets into hull sections through their assembly, in a world of
white-hot welding torches and ear-splitting hammer blows, to the
final, delicate placing of wedges under the hull just before
launching. His story concludes with the meaning of it all, the Cook
on its final sea trials and commissioning.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders is not only observant, but possessed of an ability to
translate detailed observation into meaningful description. In
that, he is backed up by the unusually generous illustrations _ 40
line drawings that detail every stage in the construction of the
ship, and dozens of photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Readers are plunged into the cavernous shed Sanders calls
``Vulcan's Workshop'' as the 4-to-midnight shift works on the
deckhouse base. ``Every sound is magnified inside the steel
labyrinth, the screech of Merle's grinder leveling off welding
scars, the rhythmic clang of Randy's hammer falling on a punch
laying out a bulkhead, the background thrum of huge ventilation
fans overhead, the crackle and pop of Luke's stick-welding the next
bulkhead over, the hissing rush of a plasma torch cutting through
steel, the characteristic electrical buzz of a welder's pulse-arc
gun melting the endlessly uncoiling wire into a seam, the deep,
complaining bongs as Eric tightens a bolt, dragging several tons of
steel unhappily into alignment, the whole overlaid with the
staccato shouts of mechanics struggling to be heard over the
cacophony.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, inevitably, moments of peril _ which are rendered
even more heart-stopping by the seeming nonchalance with which they
are shrugged off. A 4-inch square of steel rips off its strapping
and clatters to the floor. `` `Jaysus!' Mike yells, jumping back.
His hands were only a few inches from the path of the pad eye.
`That was not funny,' he says. `I coulda knocked ashes into my
coffee.' ''
</P>
<P>
   One of the last actions before the Cook is launched, the driving
of wooden wedges under the hull to allow the removal of fixed
supports so that the hull will float free from its cradle, is one
unchanged (except in size and scale) since the launching of the
Virginie Sagadahoc, the first ship built in the New World, at
Phippsburg, just down the Kennebec River from Bath, 390 years
before.
</P>
<P>
   And this is a doubly nostalgic moment, because the Cook will be
one of the last ships to be launched in the traditional manner,
sliding down grease- and wax-coated timbers into the water. The
yard is already preparing a 10-acre platform on which future ships
will be built and then moved on rails into a submersible drydock.
This will allow for the building of larger, heavier ships that
cannot be built in the traditional manner _ and it is a necessity
if Bath is to continue building ships.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, there are great stories that are part of the
yard's folklore. One of the best involves the launching of the
guided-missile frigate Oliver Hazard Perry, in 1977. It refused to
start down the ways despite the best efforts of the yard crew. Then
someone in the crowd called out to actor John Wayne, who was a
guest on the launching platform: ``Hey, Duke! Give 'em a hand!'' He
got up, waved to the crowd, and walked down to the stern of the
ship. ``He just sort of leaned'' toward the ship, the chief
engineer at the launch told Sanders, ``and all of a sudden, that
ship started.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the future of Bath Iron Works, shipbuilding is one of
the things that have defined the Maine coast from the earliest
days. And ``The Yard'' is in the long tradition of grand writing
about it.
</P>
<P>
   This is a 100-ton, klaxon-horned, iron-and-steel version of ``A
Unit of Water, a Unit of Time,'' Douglass Whynott's lovingly
evocative account of the building of a wooden sailing yacht at
Brooklin, just a few miles farther east.
</P>
<P>
   There is the same wealth of detail, the same sharp-eyed sketches
of workers, the same sensitive placing of the shipyard in the
context of the surrounding community _ only larger in scale and
infinitely grittier.

GORE LOSING GROUND IN N.H. POLL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WALTER V. ROBINSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As he seeks to re-energize his campaign and move out of
President Clinton's troublesome shadow, Vice President Al Gore in
recent weeks has shed staff, has fired up his rhetoric, has even
moved his campaign headquarters to Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``new Gore'' doesn't seem to have caught on yet among
likely New Hampshire Democratic primary voters, and the Clinton
shadow over Gore's candidacy, if anything, has grown and darkened
as the president's own popularity has diminished, according to a
new Boston Globe poll.
</P>
<P>
   Since Sept. 1, when a Globe poll found that former senator Bill
Bradley had pulled even with Gore in New Hampshire, Gore's
unwavering support for Clinton during the impeachment imbroglio has
diminished his allure among Democrats and independents who say they
will vote in the state's first-in-the-nation primary. The falloff
is most apparent among women.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Gore and his surprisingly strong adversary remain
statistically deadlocked, although Bradley has turned a 4-point
deficit in the earlier poll into a 3-point lead. In the earlier
poll, Gore led, 40 percent to 36 percent, with 19 percent
undecided. In the new sample, Bradley has a 45 to 42 percent edge,
with 9 percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley drew particularly well among independents, besting Gore
48 percent to 38 percent. But underscoring the volatility that
independents could bring to this race _ and to the Republican
primary _ the poll also found that Senator John McCain, the Arizona
Republican, finds many admirers among registered independents who
now plan to vote in the Democratic contest. Indeed, McCain has a
favorable-unfavorable ratio of 2 to 1 in this group, a hint that as
the Feb. 1 primary approaches, some may find the GOP primary a more
attractive option.
</P>
<P>
   As the two Democrats prepare for their first face-to-face
meeting in New Hampshire Wednesday, the new poll numbers represent
a statistical standoff, but with both candidates popular enough
that the lead could see-saw in the next three months. The poll was
conducted for the Globe by KRC Communications Research. It has a
margin of error of 5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the deadlock, underlying sentiment among the 400
Democrats and independents, interviewed by telephone over three
nights last week, has shifted in small but detectable ways that
contain little solace for a vice president who could have expected
an easy path to nomination as recently as this summer.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, among the most attentive voters in the sample _
those who could name both candidates without prompting _ Bradley's
edge over Gore is larger, at 48 percent to 40 percent. And since
the last poll, Gore's 10-point edge among Democrats and women has
evaporated, while Bradley has lost some of the commanding edge he
had held among independents.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the likely primary voters seemed unmoved by Gore's
aggressive new posture, his criticisms of Bradley and the
endorsement he won from the AFL-CIO _ all of which have drawn
plaudits from party professionals. But among those polled, the
union endorsement was a wash, as has been Gore's attack on Bradley
for supporting GOP budget cuts in 1981. Indeed, as many of the
voters approved of those long-ago cuts as opposed them, the poll
found.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the vice president has taken symbolic steps, like
moving his headquarters out of Washington and declaring himself the
underdog, this poll shows his candidacy remains in trouble in New
Hampshire,'' said Gerry Chervinsky, KRC's president.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in a dynamic reminiscent of the 1984 primary, the poll
suggests that Granite State primary voters are more than twice as
likely to be worried about endorsements from interest groups as
they are to be impressed by them. That year, Senator Gary Hart
upset Vice President Walter F. Mondale in New Hampshire, after
hammering home his theme that Mondale was a captive of Democratic
special interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   This time, when voters were asked in general about how they
viewed candidates who seek and win endorsements from party leaders
and major interest groups, just 17 percent said they were more
likely to support such a candidate. But 37 percent said those
allegiances would concern them that the candidate was too receptive
to those interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   That pattern is a reminder of the contrary nature of the state's
primary voters; in 1984, after all, it was those very same party
interest groups that helped Mondale regain his footing and
eventually win the nomination. Still, Granite State pre-primary
sentiment is closely watched for a number of reasons: The state
holds the first primary, so the winner most often gets a momentum
boost going into the more populous primary states that follow. And
candidates log so much time in the state that a challenger's upward
movement _ like Bradley achieving parity with Gore _ is often first
detected in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most worrisome for Gore in the new Globe poll is the
so-called ``Clinton fatigue'' factor, the extent to which Gore's
ties to a scandal-besmirched White House may hurt him when voters
consider who should occupy the Oval Office in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   As voters focus on the coming election, and as both candidates
increase the time they spend in New Hampshire, just 21 percent of
the voters now say that Gore's support for Clinton during the
impeachment process makes them more likely to vote for him. In late
August, 29 percent expressed that view. Back then, just 21 percent
said Gore's stance made them less likely to support him. That
number is now up markedly, to 34 percent who say Gore's support for
Clinton makes them less likely to support the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   In the new poll, 42 percent said the issue will have no impact
on their choice in the primary, down from 50 percent in late
August.
</P>
<P>
   Driving that change has been a clear turnabout in the views of
women. In late August, women, by better than 2 to 1, said Gore's
support for the president made them more likely to vote for him
than not. But now, just 22 percent of women said they are more
likely to support Gore because of the issue, while 36 percent said
they are less likely to support him.
</P>
<P>
   Hand-in-hand with these results has been a sharp dropoff in
Clinton's personal popularity in New Hampshire, where his favorable
ratings, as in Massachusetts, have long been much higher than in
most other parts of the country. In late August, likely Democratic
primary voters expressed favorable views of Clinton by almost 3 to
1. Among women, it was about 4 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, only 42 percent of likely Democratic primary
voters have a favorable view of Clinton, while 35 percent have an
unfavorable view. In late August, the figure was 71 percent
favorable, and 24 percent unfavorable. Although Clinton's positive
rating has fallen way off, most of the loss has been to the ``no
opinion'' category. Now, with Clinton telegraphing the end of his
presidency, 22 percent say they have no opinion of him _ a number
that Chervinsky said is more likely to signal growing voter doubts
about what to think of Clinton and his legacy than an authentic
neutrality.
</P>
<P>
   Chervinsky also said it seems apparent that Clinton's drop in
popularity has created some political drag for his vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that the more people pay attention to the vice
president's candidacy, the more his ties to Clinton hurt him,''
Chervinsky said.

<P>
   COSTA MESA, Calif. _ Inside the exclusive Center Club, the 100
or so high rollers who had donated $1,000 each for a private
luncheon with the Democratic presidential candidate, Bill Bradley,
had almost finished their steak and wine when a donor had one last
question for the former New Jersey senator.
</P>
<P>
   What would Bradley do to revamp the tax code, the questioner
asked, lobbing a softball to the senator. Bradley, after all,
authored a bill that cut tax rates by closing loopholes, wrote a
book on the subject and was speaking in the middle of Orange
County, home of the California tax revolt.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley had a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I view that as a second-term issue,'' he said, dead serious.
</P>
<P>
   Some donors gasped. None applauded. A few knives and forks
clinked to the table. In this instant, the essence of Bill Bradley
was on display: a contrarian blend of blunt candor and an aloof
I-do-it-my-way approach that no consultant would dare dream up.
</P>
<P>
   What was also on display is a candidate that some of Bradley's
former Senate colleagues barely recognize. The man whose ideology
often ran to moderation or conservatism on key issues in the Senate
has succeeded so far by running to the left of Vice President Al
Gore on gun control and health care. The earnest, contemplative
figure widely recalled as a ``loner'' in the Senate who lacked
``people skills'' has now thrust himself onto center stage,
serenely recounting his childhood and urging voters to ``tell me
your stories.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to give people a narrative of where we are headed,''
Bradley said when asked to describe the theme of his campaign. At
appearances from New Hampshire to California, it has become clear
that the 56-year-old Bradley has made more than a transition to the
campaign trail; he has undergone a transformation.
</P>
<P>
   This, friends say, is something that has been missed in all the
coverage of Bradley's career, from his days as a basketball star to
his 18 years as a senator. After retiring from the Senate in 1996,
Bradley spent two years teaching at Stanford and Notre Dame, honing
his speaking style and testing his philosophy in 70 lectures, all
the while plotting how to beat Gore. And so far, the plan he
hatched has worked better than he could have imagined.
</P>
<P>
   But now, as the two Democratic candidates prepare for a
much-anticipated ``town meeting'' this Wednesday at Dartmouth
College that could turn into a full-scale debate, Bradley is facing
a new test. Having rocketed in a few short months from long-shot
challenger to a viable alternative to Gore, he now draws scrutiny
as a man who really might be president.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley seems to have a sense of where he is on the road to his
goal, and how he will respond to his new celebrity. He says he'd
still rather share his way of thinking than deafen his audiences
with policy detail. So, even as Gore begins to lash at him on
specifics, Bradley doesn't plan to take a position on every issue.
(Even his daughter, he says, has grown bored by his talk of tax
overhaul.) Instead, he is focusing on a few major proposals:
near-universal health care coverage, handgun registration,
improving race relations and relieving childhood poverty.
</P>
<P>
   To some observers, among them partisans of the Gore camp,
Bradley's notions are like heaves from half-court, idealistic plans
that have little chance of passage but that are designed to appeal
to party activists who play a big role in determining the
Democratic nominee. But Bradley is convinced that he can convince a
prosperous nation that the time is right for his ``big ideas,''
even while acknowledging that his sweeping costly proposals offer
an invitation for attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like tossing red meat in the wolves' cage,'' Bradley said
in an interview, gesturing to himself.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the space of five hours in New Hampshire, two very different
Bradleys emerged.
</P>
<P>
   The first scene was a press conference at the Manchester
Community Health Center, where Bradley was pushing his $65 billion
health care plan and facing the press. Bradley acted stumped when a
reporter asked about differences on foreign policy between himself
and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Bradley said. ``I mean, he hasn't really made
any statements on foreign policy in the campaign. I'll be laying
out my views on foreign policy over the next two months.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in fact, has spent much of his career talking about
foreign policy and has played a major role in shaping the Clinton
administration's view of the world. But there is another reason for
Bradley's reticence: he is still developing his own foreign policy.
So he is reluctant, perhaps unready, to engage Gore on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was equally unresponsive on a spicy domestic
controversy. A reporter asked what Bradley thought about the widely
reported comments by Governor Jesse Ventura of Minnesota, who had
been quoted as saying that organized religion is a ``sham,'' a
crutch for weak-minded people.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley had no idea what the reporter is talking about. Later,
when an aide was asked whether it is possible that Bradley was
unaware of such a well-known controversy, the aide said he didn't
doubt it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not if we didn't tell him,'' Bradley press secretary Eric
Hauser said. ``His focus is on more significant things.'' Indeed,
Bradley only ``rarely'' watches television news, Hauser said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But if Bradley sometimes seems tuned only to his own channel, he
also has a way of connecting with listeners, spinning tales with
the timing of Garrison Keillor of ``Prairie Home Companion.'' This
side of Bradley emerges at a town meeting in Bedford, where Bradley
reminisces about visiting a favorite spot on the Mississippi River
in his hometown of Crystal City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I listened to the wind blowing through cottonwood trees,''
Bradley said, seemingly lost in a private rapture. ``The current
heading to New Orleans. I paused, looked up behind me at the
limestone bluffs that have been there for a millennium. I thought
to myself, this means permanence to me. That river, those bluffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The 300 townspeople sat spellbound in their metal folding chairs
inside the school auditorium. Then Bradley blurted out a thought:
``News on the hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley did not explain this interjection, but he sourly spat
out the words, which appeared to be aimed both at the media and at
the public's short attention span. Then swimming back into his
original rhetorical stream, he concluded: ``To be in touch with
that permanence is important.''
</P>
<P>
   From most other candidates, this might have come off as cosmic
wandering, vaguely reminiscent of Jerry Brown's ``Governor
Moonbeam'' iconoclasm.
</P>
<P>
   But from Bradley, who has written a book about his basketball
career (``Life on the Run'') and another about his childhood and
Senate life (``Time Present, Time Past''), such philosophizing is
the soul of the campaign. Indeed, it may mean as much or more to
him as the $65 billion in programs.

SEARCH FOR AUTHENTICITY ON THE HUSTINGS 
</HEADLINE>
 REAL-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT LEHIGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If every important phase of a presidential campaign is defined
by a distinct mood, the theme of fall 1999 has been the thirst for
authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   The desire for real people rather than realpolitik explains the
rapid rise of former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley and the slower
but steady progress of Arizona US Senator John McCain, just as it
helps explicate last week's demise of former cabinet secretary
Elizabeth Dole and the woes besetting Vice President Al Gore as the
contenders prepare for this week's debates at Dartmouth College.
</P>
<P>
   Why the emphasis on the real?
</P>
<P>
   Former US Rep. Chester Atkins puts it this way: ``In
presidential elections and in second marriages, people look for the
exact qualities missing in their previous choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus we get an energetic Kennedy after a staid Eisenhower, an
honest Carter after a scheming Nixon, an optimistic, delegating
Reagan after a detailed-bogged, gloomy Gus of a Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after almost seven years of a president so wily he's
willing to parse the meaning of ``is,'' the public understandably
wants someone who is (in the traditional sense of the word) what he
seems.
</P>
<P>
   Authenticity is tricky thing, of course. Give voice to your
Fruit of the Loom fantasies and, as Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura
has learned, candor can do as much damage to reputation as a flying
body slam off the top turnbuckle.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no less shrewd a barometer of the public mood than John
Sasso, a veteran of three Democratic presidential campaigns, thinks
true political authenticity -- defined as the quality of being
reasonably forthright and candid, as refusing to pander or
patronize or evade, of showing some independence of mind and issue
-- is proving to be a defining test.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are longing for a politician who is less political, who
is comfortable with himself, who is straight-talking,'' says John
Sasso, a veteran of three Democratic presidential campaigns.
``Authenticity and trust may be the wave in 2,000 the way Jimmy
Carter's `I will never lie to you' was in 1976 or John Kennedy's
`Let's Get the Country Moving Again' was in 1960.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollster Peter Hart, who has done a number of focus groups
gauging voter feeling, says it's the sentiment that has buoyed both
Bradley and McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have seen a lot of the political types and a lot of the
media-produced and consultant produced candidates,'' says Hart.
``They look at Bill Bradley and John McCain and the word that we
hear coming to us is `authentic.' They may not be perfect people,
but what you see is what you get.''
</P>
<P>
   For McCain, that quality is seen in a willingness to brave the
slings and arrows of his own party to battle to ban the soft money
that he thinks, and says, corrupts the process.
</P>
<P>
   That's why former Congressman Guy Molinari, now Staten Island
borough president, an early supporter of George W., decided last
week to break with Bush and support McCain instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched him debating his own Republican colleagues in
sometimes acrimonious debate,'' said Molinari. ``He has the
strength and courage to do that, so I started to search my soul and
my conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bradley, it's been a quiet determination to speak his mind
in his own way on his own timetable, taking thoughtful stands on
big issues like gun control, universal health care, and child
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   One important fact grounding both men in the public mind is that
both came to public attention outside of politics, says Democratic
consultant Mary Anne Marsh. McCain's five and a half years as a
prisoner of war in Vietnam speaks to a courage and mental toughness
unmatched in the field, while Bradley's determined, dignified NBA
career shows him a high-minded competitor determined to do things
his own way, she thinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because people know their personal histories and who they are
as people it makes them much more willing to believe the promises
they make as they run for president,'' says Marsh.
</P>
<P>
   Now consider the perils of the inauthentic.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's victim was Elizabeth Dole, whose quest started with
high hopes, but was soon hampered by the ultra-cautious nature of a
candidate so programmed she seemed robotic, so averse to
spontaneity that even a seeming casual decision to leave the podium
and mingle the crowd was planned -- and announced -- in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Dole's loss is McCain's gain. In the last few months, McCain has
made steady progress toward establishing himself as the only
plausible alternative to Bush. Dole's departure should formally
crystallize the sense of a choice narrowed to two, for McCain and
Bush are the only two plausible GOP candidates.
</P>
<P>
   That political paring, in turn, should worry George W.; though
he is charismatic and affable, he's also a candidate built by the
consultancy, and as someone learning the issues as he goes, Bush
can't hope to compete with McCain's candid style.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Texas governor's decision to skip Thursday's GOP
forum at Dartmouth will only underscore that sense.
</P>
<P>
   Which is one reason former New Hampshire Senator Warren Rudman,
admittedly a McCain partisan, thinks the Arizona senator looks
increasingly good in New Hampshire, where, according to the latest
polls, he now trails Bush by only 16 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``John's candor can get him in a little trouble sometimes, but
overall I think it's what people are looking for,'' said Rudman.
``The results of the last eight years have been so much
controversy, so much partisanship, so much back-biting, so many
purely political statements as opposed to dealing factually with
the issues that my sense is that people really want someone who
talks right to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudman, of course, is focused on the GOP race -- but his sense
of the public is one that Gore should take notice of.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the vice president's reaction thus far to Bradley's
surge suggests he misinterprets the public sentiment as mostly
public weariness with Clinton. During a recent visit to the Globe,
Gore revealed that mindset, saying, ``I'm counting on Clinton
fatigue fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Gore is undoubtedly suffering from association, his
problem goes far beyond a weariness with all things Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the latest University of Massachusetts
survey, conducted Sept. 29-Oct. 5, which showed Bradley now
narrowly leads Gore in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The single biggest individual difference in voters' minds
between the two? A sense that Bradley is a genuine person. Asked
who ``talks and acts like an upfront person,'' 22.7 percent chose
Gore, while 42.6 percent said Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
   In the search of a better connection, Gore has moved his
headquarters from Washington to Nashville, altered his wardrobe,
and even declared that henceforth he will override his innate
inclination to think before he speaks.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the vice-president has come up with a plan to be
authentic. That's not only risible, but risky, should voters spot
the man behind the curtain. ``Gore has a credibility problem that
could become critical if his shape-shifting becomes obvious,''
notes political analyst Lou DiNatale.
</P>
<P>
   It's a risk aggravated by a growing disparity between the new,
candid candidate Gore claims to be and the way he continues to
campaign. Consider: in the three weeks since leaving the dreaded
beltway, Gore has courted -- and won -- the AFL-CIO's endorsement,
while trying to lock up Democratic Party superdelegates, the
party's consummate insiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore has moved to Nashville, but he sends a different message:
I am an insider,'' said Richard Morris, the political consultant
who helped plot Clinton's 1996 campaign. ``His reliance on the
AFL-CIO endorsement and on the super-delegate strategy vitiates the
move to Nashville and only adds to his woes.''
</P>
<P>
   If Gore's psychic address is still K Street, Washington, so,
too, do the campaign barbs he has directed Bradley's way have a
distinct inside-the-beltway feel to them.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, the gravamen of his critique of Bradley runs this way:
the former New Jersey senator should be suspect with real Democrats
because he voted for the Reagan budget cuts; supported the contras;
has voted for vouchers for children trapped in perennially
under-performing public schools; and quit the Senate in 1996, to
mull running for president as an independent.
</P>
<P>
   But those arguments Those are weak arguments for half a host of
reasons. For starters, that tack, like his promise to the AFL-CIO
to veto ``any anti-union bill,'' position Gore, once in the
vanguard of the moderate ``New Democrat'' movement, squarely as the
defender of old-line Democratic orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   As Sasso notes, ``Gore may be reinforcing exactly what a lot of
Democrats like about Bradley: that he is not adhering to a certain
orthodoxy and that he is his own person.''
</P>
<P>
   But most tellingly, with the exception of Gore's charge that
Bradley's plan to expand health care is prohibitively expensive,
the vice president's critique of his rival speaks not to principled
policy differences, but rather of tactical sniping, in some cases
on matters more than a decade old.
</P>
<P>
   It is, in other words, nothing more than politics as usual. And
there's nothing at all authentic about that.

WALL STREET JOURNAL   FLEXES ITS POLITICAL MUSCLE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is at least one ominous cloud beginning to threaten the
sunny candidacy of popular Republican frontrunner George W. Bush:
The editorial page of The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the staunchly conservative Journal has
belittled Bush's supposed lack of ideas, mocked his ``compassionate
conservative'' mantra, and in a piece headlined ``From Oil to
Baseball to the Governor's Mansion,'' portrayed him as a stumblebum
businessman who made his fortune trading off family ties and shady
insider connections.
</P>
<P>
   Given its moral certainty, energy, and combativeness, the
paper's opinion page is not simply a repository of lively
commentary. It is a serious journalistic mover and shaker that
likes to change the course of history.
</P>
<P>
   It is a page that helped invent supply-side economics years
before Ronald Reagan made it the cornerstone of US economic policy.
It is from there that editorial board member Dorothy Rabinowitz
launched the crusade that helped reopen the Fells Acres child
sex-abuse case in Massachusetts, and earlier this year, broke the
news that Juanita Broaddrick was accusing President Clinton of a
1978 sexual assault _ a story the paper's news side didn't deem
worthy of pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal was an early and vocal opponent of the now
widely-destained Independent Counsel statute, frequently calling
for the scalp of Iran-Contra special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh. Yet
its animus toward Clinton led the paper to treat Kenneth Starr as a
hero. A furious White House officially charged the ediorial page
with being a conduit of right-wing ``fringe stories,'' and in some
quarters, the Journal's bruising treatment of deputy White House
Counsel Vincent Foster is still blamed for Foster's suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Journal is not only the keeper of the conservative
flame, or what CNN senior political analyst William Schneider calls
``the enforcer of right wing political correctness,'' it is also a
major force in Republican national politics.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, when it comes to the Journal's editorial page, may be
battling both history and ideology. The paper never thought much of
his father's brand of moderate Republicanism, and so far, it seems
to believe that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
</P>
<P>
   A Bush spokesman would say only that ``we look forward to
discussing the details of our economic and tax policy with them.''
Fred Barnes, executive editor of the conservative magazine, The
Weekly Standard, says an angry Journal might not derail the Bush
freight train. But he warns: ``It's powerful enough that he needs
to worry about it. If I were George W. Bush, I'd want to go and sit
down with Bob Bartley.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartley, the shy, retiring 62-year-old Iowan who has run the
Journal's editorial page for 27 years, is far from a household
name, nor is he a member of TV's talking head circuit. He wouldn't
catch your eye at a cocktail party, but his stature at the nation's
largest circulation daily is obvious. Even though he has no
involvement in the news operation, he holds the paper's top title _
editor.
</P>
<P>
   Bartley loves nothing better than a good fight, and his
aggressive reporting ethos, wrecking ball rhetoric and polarizing
views make him one of the most powerful _ and controversial _
journalists in the country.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 PBS piece _ ``Thunder From the Right'' _ called the
Journal's editorial page ``perhaps the most influential, the most
articulate, the most ferocious opinion page in the country.''
Writing in The Weekly Standard, former Journal editorial staffer
David Brooks declared that ``more than any other journalist,
Bartley takes risks, staking out wildly audacious positions and
launching wildly unconventional attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He does stand as a kind of icon to a couple of generations of
young . . . conservatives who really do see the Journal editorial
page as the ultimate source of wisdom on a number of issues,'' adds
Journal publisher and Dow Jones chairman Peter Kann.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees. Critics accuse Bartley of running the most
lopsided and mean-spirited editorial page in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are very talented polemicists, but for them,
journalism is just an instrument for political ax grinding,'' says
Newsweek senior editor Jonathan Alter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were only a shade removed from Richard Mellon Scaife,''
adds former White House press secretary Mike McCurry, referring to
the conservative billionaire who White House allies view as a
leading fomentor of bizarre anti-Clinton tales. ``There were . . .
times that (their stuff) was just so kooky.''
</P>
<P>
   Revere him or revile him, Bartley is a man whose mystery is his
split personality. There is the mild and quiet soul who is
worshiped by his colleagues: At a party marking his 25th
anniversary running the editorial page, former staffer Seth Lipsky
declared that Bartley ``is probably more loved by those who worked
for him than any editor in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is the relentless assassin at the keyboard who
imparted his core philosophy _ ``all you need is arrogance to write
editorials'' _ to his very first editorial page hire, and who uses
the term ``muzzle velocity'' to describe the bone-shattering impact
he strives to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Kann offers the best theory for reconciling the two
Bartleys. ``He takes delight in controversy,'' the publisher says.
But ``if Bob wants to piss people off, he might as well piss the
country off instead of you, personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the Journal's editorial philosophy is ``free markets
and free people,'' although Bartley likes to think of his staff as
``18th century liberals.'' (In the 20th century, he explains, big
government has replaced King George as the enemy.)
</P>
<P>
   The Journal's editorial page advocates a muscular foreign policy
that harkens back to the Cold War. It abhors taxes, opposes
increasing the minimum wage, doesn't like unions and rails against
government regulation of the private sector. It's led a tireless
campaign against product liability litigation, decrying lawsuits
against the tobacco, gun and automobile industries and
characterizing trial lawyers as ``the plaintiff bar mafia.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartley's minions leave no doubt where they stand in the culture
wars. After the 1993 murder of an abortion doctor, a Journal
editorial dug back a quarter century to blame the 60's, saying
America ``began to tip off the emotional tracks'' during the
anti-war protests at the 1968 Democratic national convention. When
American women captured the World Cup in soccer earlier this year,
the Journal scolded those who saw the win as a victory for gender
equity as ``professional ax-grinders.'' And after hearing that the
Miss America pageant might accept contestants who had been married
or had an abortion, the Journal suggested ``leaving the freak shows
to Atlantic City and moving Miss America to Mississippi.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Bartley's overarching passion has been a fierce
assault on the occupant of the White House. As proof, the Journal
has published a five-volume collection _ totalling 2,784 pages _ of
Clinton and Whitewater commentary taken from its editorial pages.
</P>
<P>
   The drumbeat never stops, even in these days of ``Clinton
fatigue.'' Hillary Clinton's presumptive Senate candidacy in New
York has already been dismissed as a doomed enterprise. And a
Journal editorial can still muster up the disdain to compare the
president to O.J. Simpson, or blame Clinton for Dan Quayle's
withdrawal as a presidential candidate, claiming the president has
elevated ``money and biography above ideas in our politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartley's most explosive scrutiny of Clinton came last February,
just a week after the draining impeachment drama drew to a close,
when Rabinowitz broke the news of Broaddrick's allegations.
Rabinowitz didn't want the Broaddrick assignment. ``I resisted the
idea,'' she says. ``I don't break down doors.'' But Bartley
persisted and the Journal's expose forced the dramatic charges,
which the White House denied, into the headlines. (NBC, which had
conducted the first interview with Broaddrick but delayed airing
it, broadcast the story five days after the Journal piece.)

ART OF THE PUMPKIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Eds: two sidebars, PUMPKIN-TIPS AND PUMPKIN-PARTY) 
By CAROL BIDWELL 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jesse Nester is a cutter and a slicer. Pat Monroe
is a sawer and a poker. Doug Goodreau is a shaver and a sculptor.
</P>
<P>
   Three artists with three methods, but with the same goal in
mind: a spooky carved pumpkin to light up the Halloween darkness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pumpkins can be art, if you do it right,'' said Goodreau,
who's many pumpkin carving contests so many times he's been
banned from competing and now gives carving demonstrations. ``They
can be anything you want them to be _ or can imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   Nester, 25, of Van Nuys has been carving pumpkins since he was
10 or so, and carving professionally at the Tapia Family Pumpkin
Patch in Reseda since he was 15. He and owner Tom Tapia spend
Halloween weekend carving scary faces on pumpkins for the families
who come to buy the makings for their own jack-o'-lanterns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our family wasn't real big on pumpkin carving,'' Nester said.
``But we'd always have one or two. We wanted the general feel of
Halloween.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of his carving skills were learned on the job, to amuse the
hundreds of kids who visit the pumpkin patch each year.
</P>
<P>
   He favors a short-bladed, serrated knife when he's giving a
pumpkin a personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``A knife goes around corners real well, but you can break a saw
doing sharp curves,'' Nester said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his designs go all the way through the pumpkin's flesh,
but he also cuts part way through to give designs some shading,
particularly when carving faces.
</P>
<P>
   The best pumpkin for carving depends on what you like, Nester
said. Kids who visit the pumpkin patch like the ``ghost pumpkins''
_ hybridized to grow with a grayish-white skin, although the
insides are pumpkin-orange. Nester's favorite is the Big Max. The
sheer weight of the pumpkin pulls it off-center as it grows,
resulting in a lopsided squash he says has more creative potential
than just the ordinary pumpkin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing is you want it to sit well for presentation.
And you want at least one good `face' to put your design on.''
</P>
<P>
   Every once in awhile, the fields in Lancaster, where the Tapias
grow their pumpkins, will yield one that looks like a human's bare
backside. ``The kids call them `butt pumpkins,''' Nester said with
a laugh. ``And sometimes we'll come up with what we call a `monster
pumpkin' that's all bumps and lumps. The kids see them and go nuts,
but they're not really monsters. It's all a result of fertilization
and pollination.''
</P>
<P>
   Monroe, a Yorba Linda resident, also began carving as a child
and grew up to carve pumpkins for many television shows. She favors
straightforward designs that go right through to the inside of the
pumpkin, a method best suited to the carving tools devised in the
mid-1940s by her dad, Paul Bardeen.
</P>
<P>
   Worried that his four daughters _ son John hadn't been born yet
_ would cut their fingers along with pumpkin flesh when creating a
jack-o'-lantern, Bardeen fitted a coping saw blade into a short
length of dowel to create a safer saw, and gave his girls first a
hatpin, and later a big nail, to use to punch-mark their designs.
</P>
<P>
   ``With these tools, we would each carve our own pumpkins,'' said
Monroe, now 63. ``Every one of us would design our own pumpkin,
usually with our names, our ages and the year on it.''
</P>
<P>
   And dad was always in the thick of things, carving his own
spooky faces for his own girls and the neighbor kids, who loved his
makeshift tools. After Paul Bardeen died in 1972, John, the
youngest of the Bardeen kids, thought it would be a fitting tribute
to their father _ as well as a boon to kids everywhere _ to refine
his dad's carving tools and market them around Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   Denver-based Pumpkin Masters _ which sells scrapers, drills,
saws and patterns for spooky and funny designs at discount, drug
and other stores _ was born.
</P>
<P>
   Halloween was always an exciting time in the Bardeen home,
Monroe recalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been a big deal to go to the pumpkin patch,'' she
said. ``Each of us would pick out a pumpkin that had a nice, smooth
surface, good for putting a design on. We always wanted really big
ones, but we had to make sure we got ones that were small enough
for us to carry. We'd carve them, then carry them with us when we
went trick-or-treating to show them off.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Pat, John and sisters Jan, Diane and Kathy all demonstrate
skills taught to them by their dad, passing along the tricks of the
trade to their own kids and to others at malls, on TV shows and at
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tradition just keeps on going,'' Monroe said. ``Dad would
have loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the three carvers, Goodreau, 30, of Tujunga takes the most
artistic approach to his pumpkin carving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a sculptor and a painter,'' said Goodreau, who makes up
bodies at a funeral home and is studying at California State
University, Los Angeles, to be a paleontologist. ``I look at
pumpkins as objects to be sculpted, shaded, worked with, then
highlighted with paint.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Nester, he hunts for lopsided, lumpy pumpkins on which to
carve his designs with a sharp, thin-bladed knife and a handful of
sculptor's tools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mother Nature's got it halfway there for you,'' Goodreau said.
``You just have to find a design to fit the area. I don't mind
lumps and bumps; they sometimes make the best designs. The more
distorted, the better. I once found a weird-shaped pumpkin that was
kinda long and curvy; !ital!I!off! saw a dragon all curled up. I
won a contest with that one. If you get a really big one, you can
do a whole scene on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Misshapen pumpkins have another advantage, he said: Sometimes
supermarkets and pumpkin patches will give them away because most
carvers don't want them.
</P>
<P>
   But the plain round pumpkin has its advantages, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are neat,'' he said. ``You can devise whatever pattern
you want, take one from a picture in a magazine or a coloring book
or draw one freehand. You get different levels of flesh, and that
gives it more depth. And if you light it up at night, it looks
pretty horrific.''

HELMS IS HURTING GOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While some Republicans recognize the need to reach out to
African-Americans and Hispanics in the 2000 election, US Senator
Jesse Helms and other arch-conservatives appear to be doing their
best to distance those groups.
</P>
<P>
   Helms is virulently opposed most recently to President Clinton's
nomination of former Illinois Senator Carol Moseley-Braun as
ambassador to New Zealand. His outspoken stance may well drive more
African-Americans and Hispanics into the outstretched arms of the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Helms has the
power and influence to block a nomination, as demonstrated with his
refusal in 1997 to bring William F. Weld's doomed nomination as
ambassador to Mexico to a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   This time Helms is taking on the first black woman elected to
the Senate. If Tom Daschle, the minority leader from South Dakota,
is correct, no former senator has been rejected for an
ambassadorial post since 1935.
</P>
<P>
   Helms's opposition is creating more problems for him and his
party than for her and the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   It is well-known, for example, that Moseley-Braun in 1993 almost
single-handedly defeated Helms's proposal to renew the United
Daughters of the Confederacy's design patent on an insignia that
featured a Confederate flag in a wreath. Although the Senate
earlier approved the proposal, Moseley-Braun said in an impassioned
Senate speech that the flag was an emblem of slavery. The Senate
voted 75 to 25 to reject it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, six years later, Helms apparently still is miffed over that
stinging defeat by a freshman senator. Last week, he said he would
block the nomination unless Moseley-Braun apologized to him. ``At
the very minimum, she has got to apologize for the display that she
provoked over a little symbol for a wonderful group of little old
ladies.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Helms's lingering anger at Moseley-Braun for her
defeat of a symbol of slavery and segregation tells more about his
views toward blacks than about her qualifications to be ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was that that prompted him to change the reason
behind his problem with her nomination. He was later quoted saying
that ``this nomination comes to the Senate with an ethical cloud
hanging over Ms. Moseley-Braun.'' Without providing specific
allegations, Helms said that ``charges of ethical lapses led the
voters of Illinois to determine she was not fit to represent them
in the US Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   What Helms was referring to were questions about her handling of
campaign finances and about a trip she made to Nigeria to meet with
the dictator Sani Abacha. Her opponent, Peter Fitzgerald, made
these questions the main focus of his successful campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Internal Revenue Service opened an investigation of her
campaign finances, but there were no resulting charges or
penalties. Ironically, Fitzgerald was quoted in a news article
saying he ``probably would have voted with Senator Moseley-Braun on
that issue'' of the Confederate flag.
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent attempt to further bolster his own opposition,
Helms said in a statement that questions about her were raised by
the New Zealand government. Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said the
New Zealand government raised no questions about Moseley-Braun,
adding, ``I don't think they should bring the New Zealand
government into it.''
</P>
<P>
   What Helms is left with is his own mean-spirited and petty
attempts to block the nomination of a black woman, a former
senator, who defeated him fair and square on an issue. Media
reports on the nomination have pointed out that Helms's opposition
may be rooted in his views on race, and the flag issue.
</P>
<P>
   As most observers familiar with Helms's record knows, he was a
staunch segregationist in the 1950s and '60s. In the 1970s, he
denounced the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. He also launched a
filibuster against legislation making King's birthday a national
holiday. And in the 1980s, he supported apartheid in South Africa.
Many critics viewed his 1990 campaign against Harvey Gantt, an
African-American, as one of the most racist campaigns in recent
memory.
</P>
<P>
   Helms's opposition to this nomination also highlights stances by
other Republicans that reflect poorly on their view toward blacks
and Hispanics. Earlier this month, Senate Republicans voted in a
55-to-45 party-line vote to reject the nomination of Judge Ronnie
White, the first black on Missouri's Supreme Court, to a federal
judgeship. Democrats argue that race was a factor in the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, including Clinton, also point to Republican-led
stalling in the Senate on the president's nomination of Richard A.
Baez, a Hispanic, to the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
As Daschle said, there appears to be an ``array of anti-minority
sentiment'' being expressed by Republicans on these issues.
</P>
<P>
   If Helms continues to remind voters about his actions and those
of his GOP fellows, he may be one of the best allies the Democrats
have in their quest to wrest control of Congress next year.

BEFORE YOU START CARVING 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By CAROL BIDWELL 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As any kid can tell you, it's not hard to carve a
pumpkin. Eighty-six percent of kids and parents will either carve
or decorate one this Halloween, according to surveys of shoppers in
malls around the country.
</P>
<P>
   But it takes a little expertise to come up with a pumpkin
that'll make the neighborhood go ``Wow!'' when it's lighted up on
Halloween night.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some tips from the experts:
</P>
<P>
   The best way to anchor a pumpkin for carving is to cradle it
between your knees.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the lid a bit off-center, with the opening a bit toward the
back to give more front carving surface. Make your cuts at an
angle, rather than straight up and down, so the lid won't fall
through when it's replaced. Cut a notch out of the back of the lid
so it can be set in place easily, and cut a small hole in the lid
to act as a chimney if you plan to use candles to light your
jack-o'-lantern.
</P>
<P>
   Some people can be sensitive to the fibrous goo that's inside
the pumpkin, so it's a good idea to wear long sleeves and rubber
gloves when scooping out the insides. If your pumpkin has thick
walls, scoop away the inside of the carving surface to about 1 inch
thick.
</P>
<P>
   Map out your design before starting to cut _ with a pencil if
you're carving freehand, or with a big nail or spike if you're
transferring a design from a magazine, a coloring book, a
pumpkin-carving pattern book or a picture you've drawn yourself.
(the Pumpkin Masters Web site at www.pumpkinmasters.com provides
free patterns you can download.)
</P>
<P>
   Once the design is transferred to your pumpkin, it's safest to
saw through the flesh with a serrated knife or carving tool. To
keep blades from bending or snapping off, lift the blade out of the
flesh and plunge it in again rather than trying to saw around
corners.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry if you cut off a chunk you meant to leave attached.
Reattach it with toothpicks, and nobody will notice the difference.
Or change the design to incorporate your mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Many stores sell battery-powered lights to light up your
pumpkin. If you light it with candles, put them in empty baby food
jars or votive holders to keep from burning the pumpkin. If you
plan to photograph your handiwork, three votives inside give the
best light.
</P>
<P>
   Once your pumpkin is carved, it'll usually last for two or three
days before it begins to dry out. But you can retard spoilage a
little longer by coating cut surfaces with petroleum jelly or lemon
juice. If your pumpkin does dry out, remove the light or candle,
fill a tub or sink with water and soak the pumpkin overnight. Dry
it off, and it should be good for another night or two.

THROW A PUMPKIN-CARVING PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By CAROL BIDWELL 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If you haven't picked your pumpkin out of the
local pumpkin patch, there's still time not only to carve your own
jack-o'-lantern, but to plan a party where pumpkin carving is the
main activity.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some tips for a successful party from John Bardeen,
president of Pumpkin Masters, which makes carving kits:
</P>
<P>
   Schedule the party one to three days _ about the shelf life of a
carved pumpkin _ before Halloween so your guests can show off their
pumpkins to trick-or-treaters. If you live in an area where
trick-or-treating is unsafe, a pumpkin-carving party can be fun on
Halloween night, too, with guests arriving in costume.
</P>
<P>
   Have each guest bring a pumpkin. For minimal cleanup, ask guests
to clean out the insides before they arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Use a pumpkin theme, serving pumpkin pie; pumpkin soup; pumpkin
cookies, muffins or bread; and roasted pumpkin seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Have enough knives or other carving tools for every guest.
Purchased kits usually include patterns, which you can photocopy in
several sizes so you have a variety.
</P>
<P>
   Have an adult teach everybody how to use knives or tools to
carve.
</P>
<P>
   After all pumpkins are carved, have an adult place candles or
battery-powered lights inside each and turn out room lights to show
off everybody's handiwork. Photograph each guest with his pumpkin,
and get a group shot, too.
</P>
<P>
   By the light of the pumpkins, tell stories, sing songs and
finish off the food.

 UNDATED: ... the Journal piece.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Observers of the Journal were not suprised to find damaging
allegations against Clinton on the editorial page. But what is so
unusual, and unique to Bartley's tenure, is that a story alleging a
violent felony by Clinton was not produced by the news staff, but
by the opinion pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess from where I sit, it doesn't matter to me very much
whether we break a story on the editorial page or on the front
page,'' says Kann. ``The Wall Street Journal probably does more
analytical, interpretive journalism on its front page than most
newspapers, and our editorial page does more reporting, breaks more
news than most, if not all, newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   But managing editor Paul Steiger, who oversees the Journal's
news pages, had reservations about the Broaddrick piece. ``It's not
a story that I would have sent a reporter after,'' he says.
``You've got to make judgments about where you concentrate your
fire. This happened way before Clinton was running for president .
. . It's got to be in the realm of `he said, she said,'
territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartley's fiercely independent fiefdom can create the impression
that the Journal's editorial and news pages are published by two
different papers, a journalism phenomenon described as the
unbreachable wall between ``church and state.''
</P>
<P>
   Some old hands still recall how Bartley antagonized the paper's
Washington bureau during a combative 1980 dinner meeting by
suggesting that his editorial page staffers were better news hounds
than the Beltway reporters. Bartley acknowledges that at that
dinner, he was sitting on the news that he was about to win the
Pulitzer prize for editorial writing and ``I was full of myself . .
. There was a message that `you have to understand that we have
access to some sources that you don't.'''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the editorial page alienates crucial Beltway sources,
Steiger calls it an overall ``asset,'' but says, ``yes, there are
people who despise its politics . . . Frankly we can usually make
these people understand the difference'' between news and opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Strange as it may seem, Bob Bartley went on C-SPAN in 1992 and
actually said: ``I don't have any real strong opinions about Bill
Clinton. I don't think he's a menace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know at what point I would have explicitly
abandoned,'' that view, he now says. But ``the more you poked at''
the president's Arkansas inner circle, ``the more creatures you
found.'' Rabinowitz says her boss takes genuine ``moral offense''
at the president.
</P>
<P>
   Many editorial pages have made no secret of their quarrels with
Clinton, but none has pursued him with the Journal's vigor. ``The
problem with Clinton was not the sex, but the lies,'' says Bartley,
flashing his lethal wit. ``Sex happened to be the one he got caught
for because it was the hardest to delegate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Journal's case against Clinton long predated Monica
Lewinsky. Early on, the editorial page took aim at Foster, starting
with a 1993 piece called ``Who is Vincent Foster?'' that made a
significant issue of the fact that Foster would not provide the
Journal with a photo. When Foster was later found dead along with a
note that read ``WSJ editors lie without consequence,'' Bartley
went from the hunter to the hunted, with critics questioning
whether he could sleep at night.
</P>
<P>
   After Foster's death, Journal editorials raised the theory that
he had been murdered _ lauding the work of leading murder
conspiracy proponent and fringe journalist Christopher Ruddy _
before finally accepting the suicide ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we said was (Foster's death) was never seriously
investigated and ought to be,'' says Bartley. ``The only guy around
who seemed to be investigating it was Chris Ruddy.'' He dimsisses
allegations that the Journal may have driven Foster to suicidal
despair as White House ``spin . . . We shined the spotlight on this
guy. Vince Foster was thought of as a steely litigator from this
tough law firm.''
</P>
<P>
   The Journal's editorial pages also ardently pursued the Clinton
version of ``X-Files,'' a series of shadowy allegations about drug
dealing and skulduggery near Mena, Arkansas while Clinton was
governor. The story never gained traction in the mainstream press,
but Bartley ran numerous pieces with headlines like ``Mysterious
Mena,'' and ``The Mena Coverup.''
</P>
<P>
   He admits there never was any smoking gun, but ``the point about
Mena . . . and drug smuggling was that Arkansas was a pretty
corrupt place,'' says Bartley. ``He was the governor at the time .
. . Why isn't it a story?''
</P>
<P>
   The fascination with subjects like the Foster murder theory and
Mena not only gained the editorial page a reputation as the media's
leading Clinton hater. It left even some sympathizers shaking their
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as The Weekly Standard didn't like Clinton, we didn't
see as many conspiracies as the Journal,'' says Barnes. And former
editorial page staffer Jude Wanniski chastises Bartley for
``chewing up all his energies playing Captain Ahab trying to get
the White Whale in the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bartley speaks, it sometimes looks like the words are
causing him pain. He gives no hint of that passion and
pugnaciousness. But according to his chief deputy, the juices don't
really start flowing until the hunt begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Bartley has probably the best news instinct of any
journalist I've been around,'' says deputy editorial page editor
Dan Henninger, a 22-year Journal veteran, who now supervises much
of the daily workload. ``He loves to chase the news. It actually
physically animates him in a discernable way.''
</P>
<P>
   Steiger, the managing editor, credits Bartley with pioneering
``the reported editorial.'' With Bartley, that can mean the tricky
intersection of fact and opinion. A Journal editorial on Broaddrick
asserted that ``the truth doesn't necessarily lie in a 50-50
balance between consenting parties. The truth is sometimes served
by reporting based on a view of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   That idea sparks some debate. ``Their reporting is not real
reporting,'' says Alter. ``It sometimes digs up great stuff, but at
a fundamental level, it's pretend reporting'' because it doesn't
always examine both sides of an issue.
</P>
<P>
   In a decade-old piece in The American Lawyer headlined ``Daily
Diatribe of the American Right,'' Stuart Taylor asserted that the
editorial page's reporting on a variety of legal issues _ from its
assault on Michael Dukakis' veto of pledge of allegiance
legislation, to its campaign against opponents of Robert Bork's
Supreme Court nomination _ was driven more by raging ideology than
a quest for the facts.
</P>
<P>
   A similarly critcal 1996 Columbia Journlism Review piece by
freelancer Trudy Lieberman called ``Bartley's Believe it Or Not!''
accused the editorial page of being ``riddled with errors.'' It
cited inaccurate Journal attacks on everything from judicial
nominees to the Smithsonian's Enola Gay exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   Never one to let a challenge go unanswered, Bartley retaliated
with a 2,000-word Journal piece assailing Lieberman's employer, the
Consumer's Union, as a lackey for big-money lawsuits and lawyers.
In a piece on the controversy that he wrote for the liberal
magazine The Nation, Eric Alterman concluded that picking a fight
with Bartley ``is a bit like leaping head first into a tank of
starving piranhas.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Bartley's biggest _ and most revealing _ battle was the
famous ``Yellow Rain'' affair. Butting heads with The New York
Times and a good chunk of the scientific community, the Journal's
editorial page waged an intense campaign throughout the 80's to
convince readers that so-called ``Yellow Rain'' in Southeast Asia
in the 1970's was a sinister Soviet biological weapon. (In his
recent memoir, former Times executive editor Max Frankel indulged
in a bit of gloating, mocking the Journal's position when, as he
put it, Yellow Rain ``turned out to have been bee excrement.'')
</P>
<P>
   To this day, Bartley remains ``convinced we're right'' about
``Yellow Rain.'' Lipsky calls the subject ``the most important of
the (Journal) controversies . . . It was the implication behind it,
it was that the Soviets couldn't be trusted to stick to a weapons
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   In several telling ways, Yellow Rain was classic Bartley. It
represented reporting based on a world view. And most importantly,
it allowed this quiet man to engage in his favorite passion _
loudly slugging it out with the media establishment, the scientific
community, and anyone else who doubts the righteousness of his
cause.
</P>
<P>
   Bartley admits the ``one time in which (his job) wasn't much fun
was the Bush administration,'' when he had a president he couldn't
love or loathe. Of George W., he says: ``We would hope . . . that
as the campaign goes on Bush develops more of a message on the
issues.'' One gets the strong sense that given his druthers,
Bartley would have more fun spending the next four years
carpet-bombing President Al Gore or Bill Bradley than pulling his
punches with another Bush administration. Conscientious objector
status just doesn't suit him.
</P>
<P>
   Economist Arthur Laffer, one of Bartley's early supply-side
gurus and an old friend, neatly sums up the Bartley credo. ``Bob
really wants to be in the battle til he's dead.''

 COSTA MESA: ... in programs.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I want to cleanse our democratic process, revitalize faith in
each other, put purpose back in public service,'' Bradley said.
``I'm doing that in a way that I think is true to who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Few people are watching Bradley with as much fascination as his
former colleagues in the Senate. Former senator Paul Simon, the
Illinois Democrat who also has run for the presidency and who has
not made an endorsement in this race, has no recollection of
Bradley as a leader on one of his signature campaign issues, health
care. Other former colleagues note that Bradley often took
conservative positions, supporting private school vouchers and aid
to the Nicaraguan contras.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Bradley was somewhat of a loner,'' Simon said. ``He was
not a particularly collegial member of the Senate. He is a
thoughtful guy, and very able, and if he is the Democratic nominee
I would have no difficulty supporting him. But he is a loner and
also very cautious.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was Bradley's caution in 1990 that made him slow to
distance himself from a tax increase proposed by former governor
Jim Florio in New Jersey. That misstep nearly led to his defeat in
his last reelection bid, a near-death experience over taxes that
helps explain why Bradley isn't pushing a new reform scheme, at
least in a first term.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bradley's closest friends say this is a less-inhibited
man on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   Don Roth, a former World Bank treasurer, said his onetime
Princeton teammate was never comfortable compromising in the clubby
confines of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Roth said that nothing defines ``the new Bill'' so much as the
way Bradley delivers his anecdote-filled narrative about two
Americas, one prosperous, one in poverty. Roth recalled Bradley
having an epiphany before deciding to run for president: ``He said,
`When I talk about the US economy, people yawn. When I talk about
race, they yawn. When I talk about national security, they yawn.
But if I talk about . . . what we are here for, I will have 10,000
people on their feet crying.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Roth concluded: ``He is comfortable for the first time in his
public life. He is at peace with himself.''
</P>
<P>
   This style was on vivid display one day recently at the Latino
Health Access clinic in Santa Ana, Calif. After Bradley delivered
his health care address, he urged those in the audience to ``tell
your stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, a woman rose to tell how she had buried seven
family members and friends during the past year, some of whom she
believed would be alive if Bradley's health plan were passed. For
the next 20 minutes, with some Oprah Winfrey-style prodding from
Bradley, the stories flowed and the former senator glowed as the
audience made his case.
</P>
<P>
   But the event took place on the worst day in months for
Bradley's campaign, just after Gore had been endorsed by the
AFL-CIO convention up the coast in Los Angeles. Bradley had hoped
to address the convention and had spent months wooing labor in
hopes of at least delaying an endorsement, which would have been
viewed as a major defeat for Gore. But Bradley skipped the
convention after the vice president wrapped up the backing of the
AFL-CIO, and the campaign arranged for the health care event.
</P>
<P>
   By appearing in Santa Ana, more than an hour from Los Angeles,
Bradley ensured little of the television coverage that is crucial
in California. The event also underscored that Bradley _ unlike
candidates such as Gore and George W. Bush _ does not speak
Spanish. When a woman asked a question in Spanish, Bradley gamely
responded by saying ``Si'' until someone finally stepped up to
translate.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, as well, Bradley seems oblivious to the usual
campaign form. During his speech, Bradley nonchalantly perched his
narrow reading glasses halfway down the bridge of his nose, even
though he rarely reads from his text, causing some aides to cringe
at the camera-unfriendly posture.
</P>
<P>
   But this all made sense to at least one member of the audience,
Hollywood film director Myles Berkowitz. Berkowitz, who directed
and starred in a recent film called ``Twenty Dates'' _ in which he
filmed his attempts to find an ideal match _ wants to make a video
about Bradley. Berkowitz says the public is ready for a
professorial kind of guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think him standing at the podium, with his glasses,
speaking his ideas, is going to outshine a candidate coming into a
hall to the sound of `Love Train,' '' Berkowitz said, referring to
Gore's arrival before the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was a crisp, campaign-perfect day in New Hampshire when
Bradley walked into the Wedding Room of the Bedford Wayfarer Hotel,
where the dreams of countless brides and grooms _ and more than a
few presidential candidates _ have been so carefully plotted in the
first-primary state.
</P>
<P>
   It is a fitting backdrop for the Democratic presidential
candidate, for a man living what he calls the ``theory of
sequential lives.'' Bradley's sequence has included quite a few _
the small-town Missouri basketball star, the Olympic champion, the
Rhodes Scholar, the New York Knick, the New Jersey senator.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his life, Bradley has been both a solitaire and a
team player, the passer who didn't mind who got credit for the
basket, the senator who didn't do much to build allliances but also
didn't care whose name was on the bill. This is, after all, a man
who once wrote of basketball, ``I always preferred finesse to
muscle and team play to solo action.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bradley seemed taken aback when asked if he was trying to
muscle away the nomination from Gore, risking a fight that could
cost the Democratic team its shot at retaining the presidency.
``That is a tough analogy to make,'' Bradley responded. ``Be
careful. I think competition is good. The people have a right to
determine who a nominee will be.''
</P>
<P>
   As the competition intensifies, Bradley's strength remains
largley untested. His sudden rise in New Hampshire polls _ a
regional showing that gave a bit of a boost to his campaign
nationally _ has come without the use of some traditional political
weapons. He pulled even with Gore without airing a single
television ad, with only a few endorsements from the political
establishment, and before outlining his major initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   But it remains possible he will falter once he faces Gore's
advertising and once his policy plans are better examined. He may
wilt after he faces the vice president in debates. His leisurely,
narrative style may not wear well. Already, Republicans are
attacking him as just another tax-and-spend liberal.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley is serene. As he sits in the Wedding Room, he is
already dreaming about the last act of his life, when he hopes to
fulfill one of his mother's wishes. He recalls that, when he was a
child, his mother gave up on one of her demands, giving him a card
that said: ``You no longer have to take piano lessons. Happy
Birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Bradley says, ``Maybe when I am 78 I will take piano and
after two or three years, I will open a piano bar.'' He envisions a
two-term former president playing at a packed house. He'd call it
``Bill's Place.''

`LOVELINE'S' DR. DREW GETS CAUGHT UP IN WEB
</HEADLINE>
  (David Bloom's weekly `Digital L.A.' column)  
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By DAVID BLOOM 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Before last week, Dr. Drew Pinsky of Pasadena was
already approaching media omnipresence _ given his ``Loveline''
syndicated radio and MTV shows and lecture appearances around the
country _ but now he's cinched the title of Mr. All Media _ Medical
Division with the debut of DrDrew.com (at www.drdrew.com).
</P>
<P>
   Pinsky _ a practicing physician and medical director of a
Pasadena substance-abuse treatment center _ has been dispensing
thoughtful advice on love, sex and life to troubled teens and
20-somethings for 16 years on ``Loveline.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's gone online with a site about as far as you can
imagine from the other big-name medical debut of recent times,
former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop's drkoop.com.
</P>
<P>
   Pinsky's site targets younger people, not only providing forums,
information and chat areas on an array of common problems (from
abuse to sexually transmitted diseases), it also brings some of the
same Hollywood glitz and guests that have made ``Loveline'' so much
more than a standard radio call-in show.
</P>
<P>
   Pinsky, who did the radio show for free during its early years
on Los Angeles station KROQ-FM, said ``the original naive idea was
that someone ought to talk to these kids.''
</P>
<P>
   He's still talking to the kids and now is doing it in a place
where a lot of his target audience can be regularly found, the
Internet. So moving online is a natural progression.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fundamental philosophy is to have fun and do good,'' Pinsky
said. ``My whole deal is to try to move the culture in a healthy
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinsky said he now makes daily stops at the online site's
headquarters, which is based in Pasadena studios built by Intervu,
the company that runs his twice-weekly Webcasts with alternative
bands and other young performers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's such a different feel than TV or radio,'' Pinsky said
of the Webcasts. ``It's intimate and real. You're sitting back and
talking.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinsky said he also oversees and approves all the site's medical
material but leaves the entertainment-oriented content to others. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
A SPECIAL BOND &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   James Bond has proved the most durable franchise in moviedom,
surviving repeated changes in leading men, creator Ian Fleming's
death, the Cold War's end, feminism's rise and an array of other
only slightly less daunting challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in conjunction with the upcoming release of the latest
James Bond film, ``The World Is Not Enough,'' fans can pick up
special-edition DVDs of many of the best previous titles (also
available, of course, on VHS video tape with some of the same
goodies).
</P>
<P>
   A $200 gift box of seven of the films _ ``Thunderball,''
``Tomorrow Never Dies,'' ``GoldenEye,'' ``Goldfinger,'' ``For Your
Eyes Only,'' ``License to Kill'' and ``Live and Let Die'' _ was
released also.
</P>
<P>
   The DVDs come loaded with an array of goodies appropriate for
the iconic nature of the subject matter.
</P>
<P>
   What's on each varies some from title to title, but all come
with some combination of audio commentary tracks from directors,
writers, soundtrack composers, or cast and crew; ``making of''
booklets and documentaries; music videos; original trailers and
radio spots; still-photo galleries and special-effects reels.
</P>
<P>
   And if the discs aren't enough for you, Amazon.com has a special
Bond site (www.amazon.com/jamesbond) with streaming video versions
of the trailers from the older films plus the trailer of the newest
one. It also has a ``Live and Let Die'' outtake, which the company
says has never been released before, and related books, toys and
other memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, if you want to watch all these discs on a device
worthy of Bond, check out Panasonic's $999 DVD-L50 PalmTheater, a
provident update of last year's DVD-L10. The 5-inch LCD screen is a
tad small and low-res, but it comes with a great remote control,
good quality playback and all the high-end audio and video outputs
you need to use it with your existing home-theater system.
Panasonic claims it's the world's smallest and lightest DVD player;
at around 2 pounds, Bond's gadget master, Q, would most strongly
approve. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
DIAMOND IN THE NET &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You can make money singing in New York subways, or selling
records with a label. Daniel Cartier has done both. But for right
now, the newly minted Angeleno just loves selling his music on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've only been up for a little while, but it's been great to
know there are people buying my CDs in Georgia and Maine and all
these weird, random places,'' said Cartier, who wraps up a series
of Viper Room performances tonight on the Sunset Strip.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, the artist was, what's the expression, at the
beck and call of these big corporations, waiting for them to give
the green light to do anything,'' said Cartier, who recorded an
album in 1997 for Elton John's Rocket Records and an independent
release in the New York subway system. ``The great thing about MP3
is that it doesn't make an artist as desperate to get a record deal
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Cartier's most recent collection of music, the terrific six-song
``Glorified Demos,'' is being sold on MP3.com (at
www.mp3.com/cartier) as either downloadable tracks or as
custom-burned CD that arrives a couple of days after ordering.
</P>
<P>
   Cartier keeps half of each sale's proceeds, a far better deal
than he would have with any label, he said.
</P>

   Cartier _ a slender, rather fey fellow whose shaved head is
decorated with an array of striking tattos _ isn't opposed to
labels necessarily. In fact, he joins others who say they have an
important role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I've got a lot of labels looking at me now, and if the
right label gave me what I needed, I'd sign,'' Cartier said. ``But
it's really not the money, it's what are they going to do to get my
record out there?''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, check out Cartier's music; his intense and
thoughtful rock sounds a lot like the band Live (perhaps with
better vocal range), a comparison he said he's honored to have
made. &QL;

<P>
   By the end of 1999, scientists plan to begin injecting a small
group of U.S. volunteers with a vaccine against Alzheimer's
disease, the most dreaded age-related malady.
</P>
<P>
   An Alzheimer's vaccine? It's not as far-fetched as it might
sound.
</P>
<P>
   Experts around the world were impressed last summer when
researchers at a San Francisco biotech company published evidence
that a vaccine prevented Alzheimer's-like deposits in the brains of
mice genetically prone to get them.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but the vaccine cleared most such plaques from
the brains of mice injected late in life. That raises the
tantalizing possibility of a therapeutic vaccine (as opposed to a
preventive one) for those who have already started showing the
memory loss and other cognitive hallmarks of Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds so wacky, but it's a very surprising result which I
completely believe,'' says John Hardy, a leading Alzheimer's
researcher at Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine is just one of an expanding array of experimental
drugs targeting Alzheimer's disease in multiple ways. All are aimed
at slowing or even erasing the brain plaques and twisted nerve
fibers called tangles that over time cause a devastating dementia,
robbing patients of their very personhood.
</P>
<P>
   The news is coming thick and fast. Just last Friday, scientists
were buzzing about a report in the journal Science by researchers
at Amgen, a California company, and Brigham and Women's Hospital.
They have discovered an elusive enzyme called beta-secretase,
thought to be critical in the first biochemical step in the
development of Alzheimer's. Other researchers are expected to
report on a different beta-secretase enzyme this week at the
Society for Neuroscience meeting in Miami Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Citron of Amgen says that identifying beta-secretase at
last will accelerate the development of precisely targeted drugs to
inhibit the enzyme, perhaps blocking Alzheimer's at the most
fundamental level.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most exciting thing about this finding is that it moves us
up a whole level in terms of having on our hands a drug target,''
says Dr. Rudolph Tanzi, an Alzheimer's researcher at Massachusetts
General Hospital. ``This brings Alzheimer's into the realm of what
AIDS researchers did a few years ago when they came up with HIV
protease as a tangible target. It's a major leap forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some of the world's leading drug companies already
have far-advanced plans to mount human tests of compounds that
block enzymes called gamma-secretase that are similar to
beta-secretase. And that's just one anti-Alzheimer's approach among
many.
</P>
<P>
   The dawning picture is a startling reversal of the gloom and
fatalism that have surrounded Alzheimer's disease since 1906, when
German neurologist Alois Alzheimer first identified the brain
disorder in a 50-year-old woman known as Augusta D. For the first
time, most researchers now think Alzheimer's will probably yield to
the kinds of combination drug treatments already known to slow or
even reverse the pathology of other diseases, such as
atherosclerosis or HIV infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think within five to 10 years we'll be treating patients
with drugs that should slow Alzheimer's in people who have it or
prevent it in people who are likely to get it,'' says Dr. Dennis J.
Selkoe of Brigham and Women's Hospital. ``I don't think that's too
optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Selkoe is one of the most bullish Alzheimer's researchers. (He
owns stock in Elan Pharmaceuticals, which is developing the
Alzheimer's vaccine and other diagnostic and treatment approaches.)
But Selkoe is hardly the only one who thinks Alzheimer's research
is moving toward practical payoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally feel very optimistic about Alzheimer's
treatment,'' says Hardy, the Mayo Clinic researcher, who is known
for caution.
</P>
<P>
   The first indications of whether new types of anti-Alzheimer's
drugs will work should come within the next 12 to 18 months, from
human trials that are planned or already underway.
</P>
<P>
   Not a moment too soon, either. Alzheimer's already afflicts an
estimated four million Americans _ not to mention their
long-suffering families and the society at large, which must pay
Alzheimer's-related costs totaling up to $100 billion a year. With
rapid aging of the population, there will be four times as many
Alzheimer's patients as there are today when the last of the baby
boomers approach retirement age in 2028.
</P>
<P>
   New treatment approaches were impossible before scientists began
to understand the silent sequence of events that lead to
Alzheimer's, a 15-year quest that has had more than its share of
frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   The first clues came from individuals with Down's syndrome, who
are born with an extra chromosome 21 (out of the 23 chromosome
pairs in humans). People with Down's invariably develop Alzheimer's
disease if they live long enough. Autopsies of Down's children who
died of other causes found extensive plaques and tangles in their
brains as early as age 12, which may imply that the damage began
before birth.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen years ago, scientists discovered the reason. The gene
for a protein called APP (for amyloid precursor protein) resides on
chromosome 21, the very one that Down's individuals have an extra
``dose'' of. Although researchers aren't sure why, APP is

MAKING DRUGS, PROFITS, AND DOING SOME GOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN HSU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The world's largest pharmaceutical companies are eager to spend
billions of dollars to develop better treatments for heart disease,
depression, and other high-priority diseases of wealthy nations,
but they are far less enthusiastic about putting resources toward
malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV, which kill millions of people in
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   Call them cruel or heartless, but they are simply following the
rules by which nearly every US company operates: they don't invest
in areas in which they cannot make a profit, and selling drugs to
developing nations is not profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Two Harvard University economists have come up with a novel way
to circumvent the problem: give private companies financial
incentives _ from a pool of public and foundation funds _ to
produce products for the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kremer, professor of economics and a 1997 winner of a
MacArthur ``genius'' grant, and Jeffrey Sachs, a noted expert on
debt relief who directs Harvard's Center for International
Development, want wealthier nations to direct dollars to
pharmaceutical research that would otherwise go toward direct loans
to impoverished nations.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs, a well-known advocate for the world's poor, believes that
when governments fail to meet the basic health needs of their
people, they destroy the base for future economic growth. But
because creating new drugs and vaccines is a technology-intensive
business that largely occurs in the developing world, the Third
World is dependent on the good graces of industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
   According to the World Health Organization, malaria kills 1.1
million people annually, 1.9 million people die from tuberculosis
each year, and 2.3 million from HIV, mostly in developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   To spur the market for vaccine development, the economists
propose the creation of an international board that would raise
funds from the public and private sector to be used by
pharmaceutical companies to develop a malaria vaccine, for example.
The first company to come up with a viable vaccine would get a
promise from the board that it would be purchased in a large enough
volume to guarantee the company a favorable return. For example,
the board would buy the vaccine at a market price, such as $10 a
dose, rather than at production cost, which could be less than a
dollar a dose.
</P>
<P>
   The private and government donors would promise the money
upfront, but wouldn't have to spend it unless and until a
successful malaria vaccine was ready for market. ``It's not
standard foreign aid; it's conditional,'' Sachs said. Sachs and
Kremer credit the seed of the idea to coalitions organized by the
International AIDS Vaccine Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   If a viable vaccine was made, Kremer currently proposes a base
award of $2.8 billion for a malaria vaccine, $5.7 billion for an
AIDS vaccine, and $3.7 billion for a tuberculosis vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a fund would both create incentives for vaccine research
and ensure that if vaccines were developed, they would reach people
in developing countries,'' said Kremer. Companies understandably
shy away from researching drugs that would be targeted mainly to
developing nations, he said, because as it is, only one in 10,000
drugs makes it from the laboratory to pharmacy shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Before a drug can meet approval by the US Food and Drug
Administration, it must go through a lengthy series of clincal
trials to establish its safety and efficacy, and the FDA must
review and pass judgment on tens of thousands of documents that
constitute the application for marketing approval. Today, it costs
about $500 million to develop a drug, and can take more than than a
dozen years.
</P>
<P>
   Kremer explained that programs to encourage vaccine research can
be divided into ``push'' programs, such as grants to researchers,
and ``pull'' programs that pay for a viable vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paying for vaccines, rather than funding research
expenditures, gives pharmaceutical firms and scientists strong
incentives to self-select only those research projects that have a
reasonable chance of leading to a vaccine,'' said Kremer. ``With
pull programs, the public pays only if a vaccine is actually
developed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sachs said that although they are strictly focusing on a plan
for a malaria and AIDS vaccine, public/private incentive funds
could be established to tackle other problems of the developing
world, such as a lack of energy resources and inadequate food
production.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, who is the senior Democratic
member on the Foreign Operations Subcommittee of the Senate
Appropriations Committee, said that he thinks that a vaccine
purchase fund is ``a good plan.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past three years, Leahy has spearheaded allocations of
$175 million in foreign aid to address infectious diseases
worldwide, with funds being used to expand programs at USAID, the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the World Health
Organization. ``We can get more and we will get more,'' Leahy said.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Dyann Wirth, director of the Harvard Malaria Initiative
at the Harvard School of Public Health, believes the trust fund
should not be limited to vaccine research, but should also fund
drug development, particularly for malaria, because a vaccine may
be as difficult to develop and as far away as an AIDS vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parasite is a professional at evading immune responses,''
Wirth said. A number of vaccines have looked quite promising in
animal studies, she said, but they later fell flat. Unlike many
diseases where people become immune for life after an infection,
malaria can strike many times before someone develops even partial
immunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't overlook drug treatment,'' Wirth said. ``If you
look at HIV, it is currently being controlled by drugs. With
malaria, if you look at history, drugs have done more saving of
lives than any other intervention.''
</P>
<P>
   Max Essex, chairman of the Harvard AIDS institute and professor
of virology at Harvard Medical School, said he respects Kremer and
Sach's idea because ``the need is so great. The AIDS vaccine
initiative definitely needs another push.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the large pharmeutical companies may not turn their
heads at this possible market, Essex said, it may motivate smaller
biotechnology companies to get involved in the research because
they ``don't need billion-dollar products to justify research
grants.''
</P>
<P>
   But Walter Vandersmissen, head of governmental affairs at
Smith-Kline Beecham Biologicals, a company that makes anti-malarial
drugs, said that although he likes the public/private fund idea in
theory, experience has shown that it probably won't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad thing is that the experience of newer products (being
purchased by) Third World countries is bad,'' Vandersmissen said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a hepatitis B vaccine has been available since the
early 1980s, and since then, the price has dropped from more than a
hundred dollars to less than a dollar a shot. ``But the product
isn't being bought. The whole continent of Africa is not using it
despite the reduction of price,'' said Vandersmissen.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the same pattern is occurring with the Hib vaccine,
which protects against type B hemophilus influenza, which causes
meningitis.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Microsoft mogul Bill Gates has pledged at least $100 million
dollars to buy existing vaccines for children, and has donated $50
million to the Malaria Vaccine Initiative and $25 million to the
International AIDS Vaccine Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the influx of money will change the rules, we in industry
will be impressed,'' Vandermissen said.

CHRISTOPHER LOWELL EXPANDS HIS OEUVRE ON DISCOVERY CHANNEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Eds: this story filed on both `e' entertainment and `l' lifestyle
wires) 
 
 
By MARLA MATZER 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Basic-issue gray carpeting, faux wood paneling ...
Martha Stewart wouldn't be caught dead in this place. That's just
fine with Christopher Lowell, vox pop decorator and king of the
Discovery Channel with his ``Christopher Lowell Show.''
</P>
<P>
   An eight-hour marathon of the retooled one-hour daytime show
(formerly called ``Interior Motives With Christopher Lowell'')
garnered some of Discovery's highest-ever daytime ratings over
Labor Day weekend. It's now airing regularly, twice a day at noon
and 3 p.m. weekdays. Lowell gets about 2,000 pieces of fan mail a
week. He plans to launch his own magazine next year, along with a
catalog full of exclusive products, his first book (from Random
House) and a line of paint (he's not yet saying who the
manufacturer is) to be sold in stores around the country.
</P>
<P>
   One of his few regrets: that he can no longer go to Home Depot
without being mobbed. ``Oh, please ... It's like I'm doing a
personal appearance,'' says Lowell with a wave of his hand. ``It's
like I'm a doctor. People come up to me and say, `I have this sofa
...' But,'' he quickly adds, ``I have great fans. They see me as a
trusted friend.''
</P>
<P>
   On the backlot of Universal Studios, the trim, balding and
bearded Lowell presides over ``Camp Christopher,'' a collection of
five unremarkable brown trailers surrounding a makeshift basketball
court (``I've never seen Christopher play basketball ... it's
mostly the show's crew,'' admits a show assistant). The show moved
to the Universal lot this season from a studio in Chatsworth,
giving the show, if not its offices, an upscale new look.
</P>
<P>
   The office decor may not be fancy, but there's plenty of coffee
and encouragement to go around for the hard-working staff. ``You
Can Do It!'' is the slogan that appears on the walls of the
offices. It's a philosophy Lowell takes very seriously; he's even
named his own corporation You Can Do It Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I created this show, I was the first to say, `This is
about personal transformation. This is about self-esteem,' Lowell
says. We get thousands of letters from people who have taken up
these projects little by little. They may watch for a year, then
slowly start trying some things. They get up off the couch, get
moving again, get involved in life again.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowell is as much a combination of fitness cheerleader Richard
Simmons and motivational guru Tony Robbins as a spiritual relative
of Stewart. He's a smart businessman first, but he also has a sense
of mission to ``make a difference in people's lives,'' he says
earnestly. Though he's quick to give credit to his staff and the
people at the Discovery Channel, Lowell isn't exactly modest about
his own talents and accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always had a lot of talent in a lot of different areas,'' he
says matter-of-factly. ``I wanted to feel like I was using it to
make a difference in people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowell has certainly made his mark on the Discovery Channel,
where, he says, he's become the cable network's ``first personality
franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   ```Christopher' is our No. 1 series; there's no question about
that,'' agrees Chuck Gingold, senior vice president of daytime
programming for the Bethesda, Md.-based Discovery Channel. ``He is
a unique personality, flamboyant, and lots of fun. He speaks in a
style that's accessible, with his whole `you can do it'
philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowell isn't resting on his laurels, though. With a carafe of
coffee and a pack of Benson &AMP; Hedges on his desk, Lowell seems to
think, talk and live at full-tilt speed.
</P>
<P>
   He's apparently always been that way: Born into a creative
family (his father was a professional carpenter, a ``master
joiner''; both his grandmother and great uncle were well-known
antiques dealers), Lowell left home at the age of 9 to play piano
with the Southern California Boys Choir. He later became a
marketing executive in the cosmetics and home-furnishings
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Lowell decided to leave a high-paying position to try
entrepreneurship. He opened a home design store/classroom in
Chagrin Falls, Ohio (near Cleveland). By 1994, he'd turned his
attention to the venture full-time. He starting producing a show
for local television in an effort to expand the business. That
show, ``Interior Motives,'' was picked up by the Discovery Channel
in 1996 and quickly became a hit.
</P>
<P>
   Probably because of his own frenetic lifestyle, Lowell
understands the need to make the home a tranquil oasis in a hectic
world. He calls this idea ``sanctuary living.'' Lowell has homes in
Laurel Canyon and San Diego where he can retreat. He says he's not
approached quite as much in California, where ``people are used to
seeing celebrities ... My popularity is more between the coasts,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   With the show's move to the Universal backlot _ where it now can
be seen on the Universal tram tour, between the ``Psycho'' house
and the ``Leave It to Beaver'' house _ and his host of new projects
on the horizon, Lowell knows there is more pressure on him than
ever before. In addition, the show's format has expanded from
interior design to include themes like cooking and entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell says what will continue to distinguish his show from
those of Martha Stewart and a host of other
decorating-and-lifestyle mavens is his emphasis on practicality.
``Martha Stewart is not a how-to show,'' says Lowell. ``She shows
us how she lives in the Hamptons. Beautifully, I might add. But
it's aspirational, not practical. She's got a staff of 90 people
and a big budget. I put myself on the same budget for my room redos
as my main audience, and I only do things that viewers can easily
do themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowell is big on simplicity: hot-glue guns, hammers and scissors
are about the most complicated he gets in terms of the tools he
uses on the show. His projects focus on problem-solving (making a
small room look bigger, finding uses for wasted space) rather than
impressing guests at chi-chi dinners and cocktail parties.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell's book next year will outline his theory of the ``seven
layers'' of decorating, starting with architecture and paint and
ending with plants and lighting. The idea, he says, is to take the
fear out of decorating by showing women that it's no more
complicated than applying makeup or accessorizing a dress. He plans
future books that will go into more depth on each of the
``layers.''
</P>
<P>
   As for what comes next after all this, the fast-moving Lowell
says that's yet to be decided. ``I've been approached about doing
things like CDs for home entertaining and motivational tapes,''
Lowell says. ``Discovery has basically told me that I have a home
with them for as long as I want. As long as it's fun and
challenging, I'll do it. That, and making a difference, is what
propels me forward.''

CHRISTOPHER LOWELL EXPANDS HIS OEUVRE ON DISCOVERY CHANNEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Eds: this story filed on both `e' entertainment and `l' lifestyle
wires) 
 
 
By MARLA MATZER 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Basic-issue gray carpeting, faux wood paneling ...
Martha Stewart wouldn't be caught dead in this place. That's just
fine with Christopher Lowell, vox pop decorator and king of the
Discovery Channel with his ``Christopher Lowell Show.''
</P>
<P>
   An eight-hour marathon of the retooled one-hour daytime show
(formerly called ``Interior Motives With Christopher Lowell'')
garnered some of Discovery's highest-ever daytime ratings over
Labor Day weekend. It's now airing regularly, twice a day at noon
and 3 p.m. weekdays. Lowell gets about 2,000 pieces of fan mail a
week. He plans to launch his own magazine next year, along with a
catalog full of exclusive products, his first book (from Random
House) and a line of paint (he's not yet saying who the
manufacturer is) to be sold in stores around the country.
</P>
<P>
   One of his few regrets: that he can no longer go to Home Depot
without being mobbed. ``Oh, please ... It's like I'm doing a
personal appearance,'' says Lowell with a wave of his hand. ``It's
like I'm a doctor. People come up to me and say, `I have this sofa
...' But,'' he quickly adds, ``I have great fans. They see me as a
trusted friend.''
</P>
<P>
   On the backlot of Universal Studios, the trim, balding and
bearded Lowell presides over ``Camp Christopher,'' a collection of
five unremarkable brown trailers surrounding a makeshift basketball
court (``I've never seen Christopher play basketball ... it's
mostly the show's crew,'' admits a show assistant). The show moved
to the Universal lot this season from a studio in Chatsworth,
giving the show, if not its offices, an upscale new look.
</P>
<P>
   The office decor may not be fancy, but there's plenty of coffee
and encouragement to go around for the hard-working staff. ``You
Can Do It!'' is the slogan that appears on the walls of the
offices. It's a philosophy Lowell takes very seriously; he's even
named his own corporation You Can Do It Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I created this show, I was the first to say, `This is
about personal transformation. This is about self-esteem,' Lowell
says. We get thousands of letters from people who have taken up
these projects little by little. They may watch for a year, then
slowly start trying some things. They get up off the couch, get
moving again, get involved in life again.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowell is as much a combination of fitness cheerleader Richard
Simmons and motivational guru Tony Robbins as a spiritual relative
of Stewart. He's a smart businessman first, but he also has a sense
of mission to ``make a difference in people's lives,'' he says
earnestly. Though he's quick to give credit to his staff and the
people at the Discovery Channel, Lowell isn't exactly modest about
his own talents and accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always had a lot of talent in a lot of different areas,'' he
says matter-of-factly. ``I wanted to feel like I was using it to
make a difference in people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowell has certainly made his mark on the Discovery Channel,
where, he says, he's become the cable network's ``first personality
franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   ```Christopher' is our No. 1 series; there's no question about
that,'' agrees Chuck Gingold, senior vice president of daytime
programming for the Bethesda, Md.-based Discovery Channel. ``He is
a unique personality, flamboyant, and lots of fun. He speaks in a
style that's accessible, with his whole `you can do it'
philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowell isn't resting on his laurels, though. With a carafe of
coffee and a pack of Benson &AMP; Hedges on his desk, Lowell seems to
think, talk and live at full-tilt speed.
</P>
<P>
   He's apparently always been that way: Born into a creative
family (his father was a professional carpenter, a ``master
joiner''; both his grandmother and great uncle were well-known
antiques dealers), Lowell left home at the age of 9 to play piano
with the Southern California Boys Choir. He later became a
marketing executive in the cosmetics and home-furnishings
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Lowell decided to leave a high-paying position to try
entrepreneurship. He opened a home design store/classroom in
Chagrin Falls, Ohio (near Cleveland). By 1994, he'd turned his
attention to the venture full-time. He starting producing a show
for local television in an effort to expand the business. That
show, ``Interior Motives,'' was picked up by the Discovery Channel
in 1996 and quickly became a hit.
</P>
<P>
   Probably because of his own frenetic lifestyle, Lowell
understands the need to make the home a tranquil oasis in a hectic
world. He calls this idea ``sanctuary living.'' Lowell has homes in
Laurel Canyon and San Diego where he can retreat. He says he's not
approached quite as much in California, where ``people are used to
seeing celebrities ... My popularity is more between the coasts,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   With the show's move to the Universal backlot _ where it now can
be seen on the Universal tram tour, between the ``Psycho'' house
and the ``Leave It to Beaver'' house _ and his host of new projects
on the horizon, Lowell knows there is more pressure on him than
ever before. In addition, the show's format has expanded from
interior design to include themes like cooking and entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell says what will continue to distinguish his show from
those of Martha Stewart and a host of other
decorating-and-lifestyle mavens is his emphasis on practicality.
``Martha Stewart is not a how-to show,'' says Lowell. ``She shows
us how she lives in the Hamptons. Beautifully, I might add. But
it's aspirational, not practical. She's got a staff of 90 people
and a big budget. I put myself on the same budget for my room redos
as my main audience, and I only do things that viewers can easily
do themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowell is big on simplicity: hot-glue guns, hammers and scissors
are about the most complicated he gets in terms of the tools he
uses on the show. His projects focus on problem-solving (making a
small room look bigger, finding uses for wasted space) rather than

 MARKET TIMING IN   401(k) IS NOT A GOOD IDEA  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. We were having a discussion at work the other day about
playing your 401(k) investment options when the term ``net
unrealized appreciation'' came up. My company's 401(k) plan allows
investment switches between various options. Some of the financial
wizards among us switch in and out of the company stock as the
price fluctuates, hoping to catch an additional gain by timing it
right. One individual said he had heard the practice was a very bad
thing to do as it effectively raised the average purchase price of
all your shares and increased the tax base. Can you provide a
layman's description of the potential tax ramifications of 401(k)
investment switching?
</P>
<P>
   J.W., Boston &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. In a word: none. When you put pretax money into a 401(k), you
face no tax liability until it is withdrawn, at which point all of
the money, including the accumulated investment gains, is taxable
as ordinary income.
</P>
<P>
   Investments within tax-deferred accounts are not subject to
capital gains taxes, so thus there is no concern about base costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Net unrealized appreciation'' is a term that applies to
investments that could create a capital gains tax liability if they
were sold. It's an important measure to watch if you're buying a
mutual fund for a taxable account and are worried that it might
deliver you an unpleasant tax bill in the form of a capital gains
distribution; the higher the net unrealized appreciation, the
greater the possibility of such a jolt.
</P>
<P>
   It is because of these (and other) distributions that a fund can
create a tax liability for you even in a year when it operates in
the red. But it is of no concern if your investments are in a
401(k) or IRA or any other tax-deferred vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, though, is that I'd like to get my oar into your
discussion of market timing within a 401(k). I think it's a bum
idea, not because of any tax ramifications, but because market
timing is one of the most difficult games to play.
</P>
<P>
   It's fine if you get it right, but it can be disastrous if you
get it wrong. If your friends are indeed great market timers, they
could probably do better by quitting their jobs and joining the
very thin ranks of successful market timers on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   But usually, it's the buy-and-hold investors who do best in the
long run, and I suggest you follow that practice.
</P>
<P>
   (at)j
</P>
<P>
   Q. I would like your opinion on whether we are on the right
track. I am 39 and my wife is 37, and we have the following
investments, all in American Century funds: In taxable accounts I
have $18,000 in American Century Growth, to which I add $150 a
month; $7,500 in American Century Balanced; and $3,600 in American
Century Global Growth. In a SEP-IRA I have $14,000 in Growth, and
$1,800 in American Century International Growth. I have two Roth
IRA accounts totaling $1,600. My wife has a $2,000 Roth IRA in the
Growth fund, to which she adds $75 a month. We also have $3,000
worth of IBM stock, and $25,000 in a savings account _ for safety
because I sometimes go four to six weeks without work. I am an
independent consultant earning about $125,000 a year and my wife
has a small retail business earning about $25,000 a year. Are our
investments diversified enough, and how will our position be in 15
years?
</P>
<P>
   L.S., Sharon, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Alas, unless you start saving more, your position is likely
to be pretty bleak in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   I calculate your combined savings rate at 5.1 percent of your
total income. Keeping your emergency savings aside, if your
investments earn average annual total returns of 10 percent and you
keep saving at the $641 monthly rate, you'll have $470,983 in 15
years.
</P>
<P>
   If inflation runs at an average 3.5 percent, that will have the
same buying power of about $280,000 in today's money _ enough to
provide you with an income stream of $18,200 a year. That's a
fairly precipitous drop from $150,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   So before you begin worrying too much about diversification, I
suggest you worry about your budget. It seems to me that you would
need to roughly triple your savings rate now _ and add to it
whenever you can _ to have any realistic shot at a comfortable
retirement in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Tripling the contributions would take the accumulation to
$982,695, and even that is not a lavish amount for people who have
been living on $150,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   As for diversification, you have very little of it. Twentieth
Century Ultra and Growth funds both hold portfolios dominated by
large-cap domestic stocks, while the stock side of the Balanced
fund is in similar shares. Nearly half of the Global Growth
portfolio is in US or Canadian large-cap stocks.
</P>
<P>
   I'd consider one of American Century's Small Cap funds _ Small
Cap Quantum, Small Cap Value, or New Opportunities. None of them
has the kind of records you have seen with your large-cap holdings,
but I think that's more a function of the unpopularity of the
sector rather than the funds themselves.
</P>
<P>
   I would also look for a mid-cap fund. There are none within the
American Century family that appeals to me, so you might consider
Vanguard's Mid-Cap Index fund to represent that sector.
</P>
<P>
   I would aim for a portfolio with no more than 60 percent of your
retirement savings in large-cap domestic stocks, with the balance
spread among small-cap, mid-cap, international, and perhaps health
care funds _ restricting the final investment to offerings such as
Fidelity Select Health Care, which focus on pharmaceuticals and
medical equipment investments (rather than HMOs and similar
companies and biotechnology companies).

IN SUMMARY, A NEW WEB BUSINESS IS BORN

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Wilcox wants to create the Cliffs Notes of business books
_ key concepts and summaries of recently published books designed
to help people easily research a broad set of categories _ from
management to finance and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Thumbing through a stack of new books in Barnes &AMP; Noble
Booksellers or an airport bookstore only to find one or two that
address key issues, or slogging through a 300-page tome that failed
to deliver what the dust jacket promised, are problems Wilcox says
he has solved.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 15, he is scheduled to launch www.means business.com, an
on-line database service for researching 1,500 business concepts
along with book summaries distilled from 400 recent books on
business. They range from the popular ``Inside the Tornado,'' by
Geoffrey Moore and Peter Drucker's ``Adventures of a Bystander,''
to more specialized books as ``Rethinking the Sales Force'' by Neil
Rackham and John Devincentis, and ``Competitors: Outwitting,
Outmaneuvering and Outperforming,'' by Liam Fahey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The re-engineering of the work force in the early 1990s has
required people to rethink their careers, figure out how to stay
ahead in their jobs by understanding new business concepts and
getting the latest information quickly at their desktop computer,''
said Wilcox.
</P>
<P>
   Users receive free preview screens that provide a one-line
explanation of a book's concept and the length of the extract. For
more details, users pay $8 to $15 for a collection of eight or more
extracts from several books about a single business concept.
</P>
<P>
   If one book has all the concepts the user is seeking, they are
printed out as 20 to 30 extracts, each three to five paragraphs and
organized consecutively as they are in the book. It costs $12 to
$15, which is about half the price of the hardcover book. However
from the Web site, users can buy the complete book for the cover
price.
</P>
<P>
   Wilcox estimates that typical users will spend $200 to $300 per
year with wwwmeansbusiness.com. For researchers expected to use the
service often, there is a flat $700 per month fee.
</P>
<P>
   The promise of selling business concepts and extracts as well as
complete books appeals to book publishers Harper Collins, McGraw
Hill, John Wiley, Warner Books and Oxford University Press. They
are among 11 of the 14 largest publishers who have signed long-term
catalog license agreements with Boston-based MeansBusiness. Under
the agreements, authors of each book will receive an undisclosed
percentage of MeansBusiness revenues for subsidiary rights as well
as royalties on any books sold, said Wilcox.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is teeming with innovation but what MeansBusiness
has done stands out as unprecedented, because it is very creative
and has a clear utility to users,'' said Adrian W. Zackheim,
associate publisher of Harper Collins general book group and
editor-in-chief of Harper Information, which includes Harper
Business books.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see the concepts being used by people to do research, from
preparing a speech, putting together summaries on detailed topics
to groups working as a team to complete a project.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically most books on business management generate sales of
under 5,000 copies with 10,000 copies considered a modest success
and 100,000 copies a blockbuster (well below the 250,000-plus found
in best-seller nonfiction books).
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the books are essentially brochures of the consulting
industry, but beyond the self promotion, they include the kinds of
detailed concepts and experiences that can help business people,''
said Wilcox.
</P>
<P>
   Wilcox found what he calls ``smart people who can type fast'' _
to read the books and extract the relevant parts using the authors
own words. Once the concepts and summaries are gleaned, the authors
and their publishers review them before they are put in the
database.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (MeansBusiness) have a damm good idea and are clearly
going one-up on what people have done already,'' said Dale Kutnick,
president of Meta Group, a market research firm in Stamford, Conn.
``We are becoming much more of a clip art society, where snippets
and bullets of information are becoming the mode that people want
to operate. They want to be smart in 10 minutes of reading _ not
plow through a 300-page book.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for all its promise, Kutnick is not sure that selling
concepts and summaries on a fee basis is the right business model.
He prefers a lower-priced subcription fee.
</P>
<P>
   And Zackheim of Harper Collins is not so sure publishers will
sell many complete books through MeansBusiness. ``We are
intrigued,'' he said, acknowledging it may take some time for
people to understand how access to conceptual information _ ideas,
principles, theories, models and methodolologies _ aggregated from
books will work on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me awhile to grasp what they were doing,'' he
concluded.

 UNDATED: ... APP is   ...  
<TEXT>
<P>
   normally made by many cells in the body; but when APP is
enzymatically snipped in a certain way, it becomes a protein called
amyloid-beta, or A-beta. And A-beta is the main ingredient of
Alzheimer's plaques.
</P>
<P>
   That observation set researchers on the amyloid trail, trying to
puzzle out whether excess A-beta is a cause of Alzheimer's or
merely the trash that builds up as a result of brain damage from
another cause. The next clue came from genetic studies of families
cursed by Alzheimer's in successive generations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Hardy and his colleagues discovered the first such
familial Alzheimer's mutation. Significantly, it was in the APP
gene, right in the region that codes for the A-beta fragment.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, researchers have found four different Alzheimer's
genes, which together may account for a quarter of all cases; more
undoubtedly lurk undiscovered. ``I expect one to two dozen common
DNA variations determine the overall risk of Alzheimer's,'' says
the MGH's Tanzi, who is currently combing the entire gene sets of
400 families for the undiscovered Alzheimer's risk factors.
</P>
<P>
   The multigene character of Alzheimer's could be bad news. It
might imply that the disease labelled Alzheimer's is a collection
of different diseases, presumably requiring many different
treatment or prevention approaches _ and a concomitant nightmare of
determining just who should get what treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, most (but not all) researchers now believe in a unitary
notion of Alzheimer's. Perhaps more important in terms of research
investment, so do leading drug companies.
</P>
<P>
   They're betting on what is called the ``amyloid hypothesis,''
which holds that the basic flaw lies in the overproduction of
A-beta (specifically, a particularly pernicious type called A-beta
42, which clumps into insoluble filaments).
</P>
<P>
   Selkoe thinks atherosclerosis may be an apt analogy. In that
disease, many genes also contribute to the deposition of fatty
plaques within artery walls, in combination with environmental
factors. The body's response to this arterial sludge _ perhaps a
defense mechanism gone awry _ converts the underlying disease
process into the catastrophe of a heart attack or stroke. Drugs
aimed at multiple points in this complex process have lately been
able to reverse this accumulating risk to a great extent.
</P>
<P>
   As with Alzheimer's, there are risk factors and genetic markers
for atherosclerosis, but the known risk factors don't explain a
sizable proportion of the cases. In Alzheimer's, for instance,
people with one or two copies of a gene called ApoE-4 have four to
10 times the risk of dementia.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that people with ApoE-4 are less efficient in clearing
A-beta 42 from their systems than those with other forms of ApoE.
But ApoE-4 by itself is not sufficient to cause the accumulation of
A-beta leading to Alzheimer's; curiously, some with two ApoE-4
genes remain mentally sharp into their 90s. For that reason, ApoE-4
is not a very useful marker for Alzheimer's risk, and neither is
the presence of A-beta in the blood or spinal fluid.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, many researchers are betting that the best hope
for treating and preventing Alzheimer's is to prevent or slow the
production of A-beta 42 _ either with a vaccine or by blocking the
enzymes that clip its precursor protein, APP, in the ``wrong''
place.
</P>
<P>
   Will it be safe to give people drugs that inhibit these enzymes?
After all, some are known to be involved in the processing of an
important protein dubbed Notch, a cell-surface receptor that guides
the maturation of various immune cells. And last week Yale
University scientist Pasko Rakic and his colleagues reported in
Science that the Notch receptor regulates nerve cell growth in
adult brains _ a finding that may turn out to be useful in
understanding many diseases, but may also be a warning flag that
Notch should not be fooled with lightly.
</P>
<P>
   Selkoe, in reply, notes that some scientists have found it takes
very little Notch protein to carry out its necessary functions, so
it may be safe to turn down its production a little. ``If I lowered
Notch production by 40 percent, it might not interfere with its
necessary function, but if I lowered a-beta production by 40
percent, it might be enough to slow the formation of Alzheimer's
plaques,'' he hypothesizes.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, attacking A-beta with enzyme inhibitors and
vaccines does not represent the only arrow in Alzheimer's
researchers' quiver.
</P>
<P>
   Because nerve cell damage may be partly due to inflammation
kicked up by Alzheimer's plaques and tangles, companies are testing
anti-inflammatory drugs to see if they can slow the disease.
Oxidation damage may also play a role, so researchers are testing
anti-oxidants such as vitamin E and gingko biloba.
</P>
<P>
   Others are testing a slew of compounds that protect nerve cells
or may even regenerate them, including the female hormone estrogen
or its newer, more selective synthetic forms.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the pipeline are new variants of the only current drug
used to treat Alzheimer's, called Aricept. These drugs boost a
brain chemical called acetylcholine that allows some nerve cells to
communicate with others, which is depleted in Alzheimer's patients.
So far it appears such drugs only modestly delay the progression of
Alzheimer's, but a report last week by Ole Isacson of McLean
Hospital in Belmont may increase interest in them. Isacson reported
that boosting acetylcholine in rats' brains decreased APP, the
A-beta precursor.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever turns out to work, it's important to keep in mind that
no Alzheimer's treatment (alone or in combination) needs to cure
the disease. It may well be enough to slow it down and keep it
within manageable bounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could change the average date of symptom onset by a
decade, we could essentially `eliminate' Alzheimer's disease in
about 13 million people, who would die of something else before
they got Alzheimer's,'' notes Dr. Trey Sunderland of the National
Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Md. ``That's really where
we are headed.''

AFTER `SEINFELD,' TV TAKES A DRAMATIC TURN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If this is a leaden year of the sitcom, a post-``Seinfeld''
depression of hollow half-hours, it is also a golden year of TV
drama. With a combination of superior returnees like ``The
Practice'' and ``Law &AMP; Order,'' and a slate of spiffy newcomers
like ``The West Wing'' and ``Once and Again,'' this fall season is
turning out to have some darn good drama karma. There are eras when
sitcoms define series television _ the mid-1960s of ``The Dick Van
Dyke Show,'' for instance, or the early 1970s of ``All in the
Family,'' ``MASH,'' and ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show.'' But as we
roll into the new century, a time in which our attention spans are
expected to move at a megahertz pace, the most notable and popular
TV genre turns out to be the one that requires ample amounts of
concentration, consideration, and devotion.
</P>
<P>
   Doomsayers might want to note the fact, as the TV pendulum
swings in the least expected direction of all. Looks as if the
American viewing public may not be too busy multitasking or channel
surfing or watching MTV to focus on a serious hour of TV, and to
follow ongoing story lines as they stretch from year to year in a
manner that might make serialists like Dickens green. While viewers
and critics alike are happy to slag the current sitcoms, most of
which are aimless and forgettable, many of us seem to be endlessly
hungry for the emotional engagement and intellectual gamesmanship
of dramatic storytelling. It wasn't long after NBC lost
``Seinfeld'' that it found its next hot ticket: ``Providence.''
</P>
<P>
   You could feel the shift in the air at this year's Emmy ceremony
in September. None of the buzz hovered around the comedy
nominations, and as tired winners Helen Hunt and John Lithgow made
their acceptance speeches you could almost hear a collective
``whatever'' from the audience. No one much cares about the poorly
rated ``Third Rock From the Sun,'' after all, and ``Mad About You''
left the air after an irritatingly bad final season. No, the
impassioned Emmy curiosity revolved around the drama categories, as
``The Sopranos'' faced off against the innovative ``The Practice,''
the revitalized ``NYPD Blue,'' the top-rated ``ER,'' and the
steadfast ``Law &AMP; Order.''
</P>
<P>
   And that Emmycast has been followed up by a season in which five
new dramas have already visited the Nielsen Top 20: ``Judging
Amy,'' ``Family Law,'' ``Third Watch,'' ``The West Wing,'' and
``Once and Again.'' The most popular is ``Judging Amy,'' with Amy
Brenneman as a divorcing mother and judge who lives with her
social-worker mother, Tyne Daly. The show, like ``Providence'' but
with fewer Hallmark moments, has reached No. 10, not far behind old
favorites ``Touched by an Angel'' and ``Law &AMP; Order.'' It has
indirectly ignited the controversy of the season, when ABC
announced it might move ``NYPD Blue'' out of its Tuesday slot to
keep the female audience for ``Once and Again'' from defecting to
``Judging Amy.'' The subtext of the debate: Is it possible to have
too many successful dramas? Meanwhile, only one new sitcom has
broken the Nielsen Top 20 _ ``Stark Raving Mad,'' a flat half-hour
riding on the coattails of ``Frasier'' and ``ER.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you tell a good story, they will come,'' says Robert
Thompson, head of the Center for Popular Television at Syracuse
University. After a decade exploring new technologies and the
options of the cable universe, he says, TV viewers are more ready
to put down the clicker and enjoy the narrative form they've turned
to for thousands of years. ``The audience is settling in to what
they liked in the first place: characters and plots with
beginnings, middles, and ends. There is still a lot more life in
the old-fashioned way of telling a story. In the end, it's all
about software.''
</P>
<P>
   It helps when the ``software'' of TV storytelling is being
developed by ambitious producers like Steven Bochco, Tom Fontana,
Marshall Herskovitz, Edward Zwick, John Wells, David E. Kelley,
Glenn Gordon Caron, and Aaron Sorkin. The expansion of the genre
went full force in 1981 with Bochco's ``Hill Street Blues,'' as it
ushered the real world, with its grit and moral ambiguity, into the
TV world. Through continuing story lines and hand-held camerawork,
the landmark cop drama brought a deepened understanding of heroism
to the small screen. Without ``Hill Street,'' this year's most
celebrated drama, ``The Sopranos,'' couldn't have transformed its
ruthless made man into a sympathetic Fred Flintstone type.
``Thirtysomething,'' too, expanded the boundaries of drama in the
1980s, infusing its scripts with the sort of acute honesty usually
reserved for foreign melodramas. And ``Moonlighting,'' along with
shows like ``Northern Exposure,'' helped break down barriers
between comedy and drama, making room for the ``dramedy'' of ``Ally
McBeal'' and ``Now and Again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Through the '80s and '90s,'' says Thompson, ``people have
learned how to watch good television.'' He suggests comparing newer
shows like ``Ttice,'' ``Law &AMP; Order,'' ``Judging Amy,''
``Providence,'' ``Now and Again,'' ``Chicago Hope,'' and ``Ally
McBeal'' to their pre-1981 counterparts. ``The state-of-the-art
drama was `CHiPs.' It was a different aesthetic universe then. A
bad episode of `ER' is much better than `Trapper John, M.D.' any
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Teen tales
</P>
<P>
   The teening of America has also brought new twists to TV drama.
The world of ``lawyers, guns, and money,'' as Warren Zevon put it,
will always provide opportunities for dynamic entertainment, as
will ``Once and Again''-style adult relationships. But the 1990s
have seen a sharp rise in dramatic exploration of the teen years
and the early 20s, the coming-of-age realm whose conflicts involve
the search for identity, the awkwardness of early romance, and
anxiety about the future. Thanks to the success of shows like
``Beverly Hills 90210'' and ``Party of Five,'' we now have better
specimens like ``Freaks and Geeks,'' ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,''
``Felicity,'' ``Roswell,'' and ``Dawson's Creek.'' These dramas
aren't for everyone; they are specifically targeted to younger
consumers. But the best of them are extraordinarily insightful and
well written, and the blackly comic ``Buffy,'' in particular, is
sure to prove increasingly influential in years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the sitcom languishes, ruined by the show that
redefined it: ``Seinfeld.'' Where can a genre go, after all, once
it has become terminally mean-spirited, emotionally arrested, and
steely with urban irony? When the paean to neurosis and triviality
wrapped up, in 1998, it left us not only with a few painful
ancestors _ ``Caroline in the City,'' to cite the worst _ but also
with a legacy of nihilistic humor that can ultimately only exhaust
itself. Yes, ``Seinfeld'' pushed the TV-comedy envelope, but alas,
that envelope was sealed with poison.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from two or three well-written fillips, including ``Will &AMP;
Grace'' and ``Friends,'' this season's sitcoms range from the
uneven goofing of ``Just Shoot Me'' and the horny-hubby
redundancies of ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' to the generic tedium
of ``Work With Me,'' ``Ladies Man,'' and ``Love &AMP; Money.'' And it's
not the reliance on sexual jokes that's bogging them down; it's the
absence of any fresh subject matter at all, the creeping sense that
TV writers are simply abandoning us in a room with an ensemble of
cynical, fearful, pop-savvy stand-ups.
</P>
<P>
   The prevalence of so-called hammock series _ lousy shows that
thrive because they hang between two hits _ has also eroded the
sitcom landscape. The two half-hours that surrounded ``Seinfeld,''
and now ``Frasier,'' have created a string of unforgivably unfunny
shows that nonetheless made it into the Nielsen Top 10. From
``Suddenly Susan,'' ``Veronica's Closet,'' ``The Single Guy,'' and
``Fired Up,'' to ``Jesse'' and ``Stark Raving Mad,'' they have all
been little more than slot warmers. Once they move elsewhere in the
week, of course, they drop to the very bottom of the Nielsens,
where they belong _ but only after they have lowered the bar on
their genre.
</P>
<P>
   And when the best of the batch deteriorates _ ``Frasier'' being
the case in point _ it's especially hard not to despair of the
form. Seven years on, the ``Frasier'' writers are nearly out of
ideas, although we should be thankful they have saved David Hyde
Pierce from having to moon over Daphne so far this season. Not that
the sitcom will ever disappear, says Thompson, despite its current
dip in popularity. ``We are going to have silly, amusing sitcoms
forever. They are the basic unit of American TV.''

   NEW RELEASES: ``Arlington Road'' _ This chilling suspense film,
starring Jeff Bridges as a suspicious history professor, didn't do
much at the box office. Don't let that deter you from renting this
first-rate, very disturbing thriller. It's for smart people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blair Witch Project'' _ Originality rules. The charming
artistry of this movie isn't really the film itself but the
anti-mainstream tale of its birth and life. It's great to see a
project that breaks all the rules win. Perhaps the commercial
success of this phenomenon will inspire others to cut through the
old tired formulas as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teddy Ruxpin: The Movie'' _ I thought he was dead. Not so. The
boy toy of the '80s has been resurrected by the marketers for this
lame story about trying to find the Princess. There are much better
films for kids but those who grew up with Ruxpin might gets some
nostalgic yucks.

   DVD UPDATE: The good news is that ``Chinatown'' and ``Apocalypse
Now'' are being released on DVD on Nov. 23. The latter contains a
commentary by Francis Ford Coppola but not, as far as we know, his
wife Eleanor Coppolla's provocative 1991 documentary ``Hearts of
Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse.'' As Coppolla recalled in 1979,
as quoted in ``Halliwell's Film Guide,'' ``We had access to too
much money, too much equipment, and little by little we went
insane.'' ``Chinatown'' (1979), one of the best films ever made,
also had one of the most creatively contentious sets. According to
Paramount, they've assembled new interviews with director Roman
Polanski, screenwriter Robert Towne, and producer Robert Evans.
Nothing from stars Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway but, if the
other three tell the acrimonious details of the production it
should be nearly as dramatic as the film. Also, Jonathan Demme's
``Stop Making Sense,'' his meditation on David Byrne and Talking
Heads, is out on DVD on Tuesday with audio commentary by all the
band members and Demme.

   Current reviews by Globe critics:
</P>
<P>
   (BS) ``Bats'' Lots of computer-generated bats taking out a Texas
town. But they're no scarier than those rubber bats dangling from
strings in '50s sci-fi potboilers. This cheeseball movie has all
the guano you could hope for _ in the batcave and in the
screenplay. (PG-13)
</P>
<P>
   (BS)(BS)(BS) ``The Best Man'' The most appealing black romantic
comedy since ``How Stella Got Her Groove Back.'' That film's lead,
Taye Diggs, returns here as a writer with a steamy autobiographical
novel he hopes won't be published until after a weekend reunion
with his old pals. They talk trash and sort out old business in
bright, warm, breezy, generous ways in a sophisticated debut from
writer-director Malcolm E. Lee. (R)
</P>
<P>
   (BS)(BS) 1/2 ``Body Shots'' Four couples pair off in LA, only to
have their scenester fun come to an abrupt end when one of the
women accuses an ex-football player of date rape. This slick,
flashy, but ultimately hollow outing has moments, but for a film
that behaves as if it wants to be Neil LaBute with palm trees and a
beach scene, it plays like ``The Breakfast Club'' pulling an
all-nighter. (R)
</P>
<P>
   (BS)(BS)(BS)(BS) ``Boys Don't Cry'' Kimberly Peirce's strong,
haunting film based on a hate crime, the rape and murder in
Nebraska of transsexual Brandon Teena. The film brings us inside
the characters of Hilary Swank's sweet, confused, spunky,
complicated, beguiling Brandon, and the alienated young woman who
shared his fantasy, Chloe Sevigny's cooly smoky Lana. Fascinating
in its texture and detail, the film depeens into a surprisingly
profound meditation on identity and isolation. (R)
</P>
<P>
   (BS)(BS) 1/2 ``Bringing Out the Dead'' Who better to take a
camera out on the streets of New York at night than Martin
Scorsese? But his film about a sensitive paramedic (Nicolas Cage)
is too heavily freighted by the man's savior complex. His guilt
gets in his way _ and in the way of a film that's otherwise
compassionately and entertainingly wired. (R)
</P>
<P>
   (BS)(BS) 1/2 ``Crazy in Alabama'' A pretty good directing debut
from Antonio Banderas. He challenges himself by trying to join a
couple of disparate story strands, one involving a civil rights
struggle, the other involving an abused woman staging her own civil
rights struggle by decapitating her husband and taking off for
Hollywood. Melanie Griffith carries the film, playing a
larger-than-life Southern-gothic lollapalooza. (PG-13)
</P>
<P>
   (BS)(BS)(BS) ``Marcello Mastroianni: I Remember'' Made during
the downtime on his last film shoot, this documentary is the molto
simpatico swan song of postwar film's great charmer. He hated the
Latin-lover stereotype, he disarmingly declares, and did his best
to play weak men. Not that it kept him from international stardom.
What's not to like about his recollections, including his memorable
collaborations with Federico Fellini? (Unrated)
</P>
<P>
   (BS)(BS)(BS) 1/2 ``Rosie'' Belgian director Patrice Toye makes
an impressive directing debut with this quietly devastating study
of a 13-year-old girl trying to make sense of her life with her
mother in a dreary suburb of Antwerp. Most of the film takes place
on the face of a non-professional, Aranka Coppens, whose stifled
intensity, confusion, and innocence make her one of the year's most
touching heroines. (Unrated)
</P>
<P>
   (BS)(BS)(BS)(BS) ``The Straight Story'' Exchanging his usual
surrealistic weirdness for simplicity and eloquence, David Lynch
fashions a heartfelt and altogether disarming piece of Americana.
It's based on the true story of a 73-year-old Iowa farmer, Alvin
Straight, who decided it was time to reconcile with his ailing
brother in Wisconsin, and took off on his lawnmower to do it.
Richard Farnsworth _ that courtly, twinkling old gent and former
rodeo rider turned actor _ is sheer perfection as the sweet but
stubborn geezer. (G)
</P>
<P>
   (BS) 1/2 ``Three to Tango'' Cute characters, especially Neve
Campbell's independent mistress of an arrogant tycoon played by
Dylan McDermott. She's a tough-cookie throwback to the '30s. But
the humor, based on the rich guy's mistaken belief that the tail he
puts on her, Matthew Perry's architect, is gay, never rises above
lame sitcom. (PG-13)

because of the possibility that some of its gigantic ice cap, which

The skull is that of a young woman believed to have roamed the
savannah of south-central Brazil some 11,500 years ago. A
reconstruction of her cranium indicates that her features are
negroid rather than mongoloid, suggesting that the New World may

wringing in obsessive compulsive disorder, the ringing in the ears
of tinnitus, the unrelenting discomfort of chronic pain and the
shaking and immobility seen Parkinson's disease all stem from the
same basic brain defect _ a decoupling of two brain regions that

DISPIRITED COLLINS SHOULD BE PROUD

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was left to New Hampshire's Senator Bob Smith to
get to the nub of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's beat President Clinton just one time on something,'' the
newly independent former Republican thundered on his favorite
cause, eliminating abortion rights. ``I'm sick of losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Better keep the Bromo handy, Bob.
</P>
<P>
   In this latest struggle in the abortion wars, a more mature
legislator in a struggle that was much different from previous ones
was Senator Susan Collins. During the annual fight over what has
been politically labeled ``partial-birth abortion,'' Maine's
freshman Republican was somewhat dispirited. A classic swing vote,
Collins felt lousy about seeing a ban on unlimited political cash
from special interests blocked by another filibuster earlier in the
week. And she was on the short end of a 61-38 vote on an attempt to
find common ground behind prochoice and antiabortion senators.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, she should have been greatly encouraged. Collins is a
major part of a fresh effort in the Senate that has good prospects
and three prongs. The first involves common ground initiatives; the
second is exposing both the absurdity and literal deception in the
partial-birth abortion banners' position; and the third is a fresh
assertiveness on the part of prochoicers, based on the reality of
the threat to abortion rights as set forth in Roe v. Wade. Taken in
order:
</P>
<P>
   Collins was a cosponsor last week of a proposal that would have
prohibited abortions after viability of the fetus outside the
mother's body has been established. Designed to track Roe's
guidelines, exceptions would involve saving the life of the woman
and protecting her health from ``grievous physical harm,'' defined
narrowly, and two doctors (one non-attending) would have to certify
each case. The two-doctor rule was added, to attract more support
to an earlier proposal that never got traction last year.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't ideal, and might not pass court review because of the
absence of protection for mental health, but the proposal made
senators think, as reflected in the votes of Northeasterners. Some
prochoicers voted to kill the proposal by Democrat Dick Durbin of
Illinois with the 61-38 majority: Republicans John Chaffee of Rhode
Island and Jim Jeffords of Vermont, and Democrats Jack Reed of
Rhode Island and Chuck Schumer of New York. But more supported it:
Edward Kennedy and John Kerry of Massachusetts, Collins and Maine
Republican Olympia Snowe, and Democrats Patrick Leahy of Vermont,
Christopher Dodd and Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, and Patrick
Moynihan of New York.
</P>
<P>
   But more revealing were the killing votes of New Hampshire's
antichoice twins, Smith and Judd Gregg. They opposed a proposal
that would eliminate elective abortions after viability was
determined even as they voted to support one that would not, in
prolife language, save a single baby.
</P>
<P>
   Their floor leader, Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, said his
proposal would ban only one abortion procedure and would not
prevent so much as one late-term abortion. Regardless of the
procedure, the fetus would be just as dead.
</P>
<P>
   Santorum also said prolifers would only support exceptions for
the life of the mother, leaving out those forced to deliver fetuses
(including those that might be lacking a brain or could survive for
no more than minutes) even if delivery destroys a woman's ability
to have future kids.
</P>
<P>
   And that, as Collins told me, ``raises serious questions about
the real intentions of the supporters'' of the ban.
</P>
<P>
   The real purpose is to directly undermine Roe in the guise of
legislating procedures for aborting fetuses. The actual language of
bills like Santorum's and 29 others proves it.
</P>
<P>
   The targeted procedure is described vaguely enough that experts
regularly testify that it could be read to ban other procedures. It
makes no distinctions among pregnancy trimesters. And it has no
exceptions to protect the physical or mental health of a pregnant
woman. That's why out of 30 state statutes like Santorum's, 18 of
21 legal challenges have produced quick injunctions against
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows these laws are unconstitutional on their
face,'' said Collins. But the threat to choice is real, and it's
time the threat produced political action as it did a decade ago.
That's why Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, offered a nonbinding
resolution calling the Roe decision correct and worth sustaining.
It passed, but only by a 51-48 test vote with one opponent (John
McCain) absent. And the Santorum measure gained one vote from 1997,
though it is three short of the 67 required to override a certain
Clinton veto.
</P>
<P>
   Harkin's purpose, quickly backed by Vice President Al Gore, was
to show that abortion rights hang by a thread in the current
Congress. It should be a wakeup call for prochoicers in both
parties. People like Collins have helped unmask the opposition.
They need to press on.

FANS ARE ANIMATED FOR `PRINCESS'

<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ When Jennifer Chang became the librarian for
MIT's Anime Club, she inherited half of the 500 tapes of Japanese
animation, or anime as it's called, that the club has accumulated
in its 10 years of existence.
</P>
<P>
   Every other Friday the 19-year-old MIT sophomore grabs a few
videotapes from her tiny dorm room, which doubles as the club
library, and heads across campus to Room 335 in Building E-51.
There she shares the technicolor booty, screening a mixture of
television series, straight-to-video releases, and feature films
for about 150 people who crowd into the room.
</P>
<P>
   The consistently large turnouts are a testament to the avid
underground following the art form has gained over the years,
thanks to the Japanese creators' groundbreaking design, complex
characters, and involving story lines that surpass any animation
produced by US studios. With such an avid and constant exposure to
Japanese animation, it's no wonder many club members are greeting
the release of the feature-length animated film, ``Princess
Mononoke,'' with enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   The dazzling anime eco-fable set in 16th-century Japan is
directed by Hayao Miyazaki, the man some people call the Walt
Disney of Japan. Like Disney, Miyazaki created a successful
animation studio that produced characters like Totoro, a cuddly
cross between an owl and cat, and Kiki, the teenage witch star of
Miyazaki's ``Kiki's Delivery Service.'' They are as instantly
recognizable in Japan as Mickey Mouse is here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Princess Mononoke'' became so successful after its 1997
release in Japan that it flew past ``E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial''
in ticket sales to become one of the highest-grossing films in that
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us have already seen it. And a lot of (other) people
want to see it, but haven't been able to find it,'' says Jeremy
Bowman, 25, in a blase, can't-we-get-on-to-a-more-interesting-topic
tone. He saw the film when he was working in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Some club members watched English-subtitled versions of
``Princess Mononoke'' straight from Japan. Others caught a
September preview of the English-dubbed version at the Brattle
Theatre in Cambridge. Demand was so high for the two screenings
that tickets sold out in half an hour, says Marianne Lampke,
co-director of Beacon Cinema Group, which programs and books Boston
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Yet nine members of MIT's Anime Club who recently gathered at
the student center to discuss their interest in the art form admit
that Japanese animation is not well known outside their club
circuit, except for the pint-sized cartoon fans who are hooked on
imports like ``Pokemon'' and ``Sailor Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I mention the movie to someone they say, `What?'''
says Arcel Frazier, 27, causing everyone to giggle in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Miramax Films, which is releasing the PG-13 rated ``Princess
Mononoke'' in the United States, is putting a lot of marketing
muscle behind its effort to entice older potential fans to see the
movie. The studio has published a lush coffee-table book,
``Princess Mononoke: The Art and Making of Japan's Most Popular
Film of All Time.'' It hired hip Hollywood actors including Claire
Danes, Minnie Driver, Billy Bob Thornton, and Gillian Anderson to
provide the voices. And the studio put ``Princess Mononoke'' on the
film-festival rounds, where it garnered raves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing I would want anyone to think is that this is
your typical Walt Disney animated movie,'' says Dennis Rice,
Miramax's marketing president. ``It's really a movie that should be
enjoyed by anybody from the ages of 13 to 90.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston has a fervid anime fan base. A recent Boston series
featuring the work of Miyazaki and other directors of Studio Ghibli
_ think of it as a Walt Disney Studios for teenagers and adults _
played to packed screenings, says Lampke. Harvard University,
Boston University, and Brandeis University boast anime clubs,
although MIT has the oldest. Club members wander from Anime Crash
to Million Year Picnic to Tower Records searching for unique work
to add to their collections.
</P>
<P>
   It's the animation's beauty that makes such die-hard fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It basically takes the format of television or a movie and
adds on a layer of creativity,'' says Carl Stern, 23, a former
president of the MIT anime club.
</P>
<P>
   Adds Ann Oyama, 20, a junior and club president, ``You can draw
anything. You're only limited by your imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being gorgeous, anime also has such involved
storylines that the work almost becomes addictive. Jason Switzer
got hooked on it as a child after tuning into the ``Robotech,'' an
epic sci-fi war series, in the early '80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found I couldn't just watch one episode and pick up the
story,'' says Switzer, 24. ``I had to actually watch all of them in
sequence.''
</P>
<P>
   Although fans range from tiny tots to adults in their 30s, most
of the anime shown on American television is targeted to
youngsters. That's made it hard for older fans to find dark,
envelope-pushing work like ``Princess Mononoke.''
</P>
<P>
   The film tells the tale of a girl raised by wolves who joins a
group of forest gods in a battle against human invaders. Viewers
get an eyeful of decapitations and severed limbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional problem with a lot of the Japanese animation
is a lot of it doesn't make it past censors in the US,'' says
Bowman. ``It's not designed for children.''
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese stories don't follow American-style morals in which
good characters survive and bad characters get their comeuppance.
In the original ``Sailor Moon'' series shown in Japan, all the main
characters die, says Bowman, but, thanks to some judicious cutting,
its young American audience didn't see that bloody end. Some MIT
club members feared ``Princess Mononoke'' would suffer the same
sunny end as ``Sailor Moon'' once Miramax got its hands on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first heard about Disney (Miramax's parent company)
getting `Mononoke,' I said, `Well, they're going to hack it to
bits,' '' says Frazier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Princess Mononoke'' escaped that fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This movie embodies (Miyazaki's) vision,'' says Miramax's
Rice. ``There's absolutely no reason why we would want to change
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Miramax hired screenwriter Neil Gaiman, who made the
film more accessible to contemporary American audiences, and hired
the talented actors to make Gaiman's words come alive.
</P>
<P>
   The casting was particularly welcomed by anime watchers.
Although English-dubbed versions of anime exist, the result is
often like watching a Fellini movie vocally acted by the cast of
``Dawson's Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The voice talent that they get simply don't know how to act
with emotion,'' Jeff Linholm, 27. ``It's just flat.''
</P>
<P>
   Anime fans hope that if ``Princess Mononoke'' is successful,
other studios will invest money to dub adult-themed anime that a
company like Disney might shy away from.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then,'' says Linholm with relish, ``you could open the door to
some of the really good stuff.''

FILM-CONSUMERISM-SIDE) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In ``American Beauty,'' Kevin Spacey's
dissatisfied suburban husband Lester Burnham excoriates his
ambitious wife, Carolyn (Annette Bening), for her materialism.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't life,'' Lester screams at Carolyn after she has cut
short an amorous moment because she was afraid he would spill beer
on their expensive Italian sofa. ``This is just (BEGIN
ITAL)stuff(END ITAL).''
</P>
<P>
   He's right. It isn't life; it's a movie.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in what can only be described as ironic, Hollywood this
fall is telling us through a number of highly regarded movies that
(BEGIN ITAL)stuff(END ITAL) doesn't necessarily bring happiness.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the American movie industry has been the world's
acknowledged leader in commodifying creativity for much of this
century, reducing art to a mass-marketable product. At the same
time, the Hollywood entertainment community itself has been
identified with consumption at its most conspicuous, setting the
pace for the rest of the culture when it came to buying luxury
cars, swimming pools, cellular phones and thousands of other status
toys.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at the end of the millennium (not to mention the end of the
acquisitive '90s), a diverse flock of major studio releases is
questioning the value of materialism more passionately than at any
time since the late 1960s. And ``The Graduate,'' after all, did
little more than snidely sniff at the concept of ``plastics.'' The
new movies launch full-frontal assaults on anything made of plastic
and a whole lot more. But this being Hollywood, there are strings
attached.
</P>
<P>
   The most overt example of the trend is the graphically violent
satire ``Fight Club.'' Co-star Edward Norton claims the film is
about ``reaching the stage in life when you recognize that you're
not going to achieve spiritual peace through your home
furnishings.'' At one point, the camera pans through Norton's
character's apartment adding descriptions and prices of his
furniture like it's an IKEA catalog. ``We used to read
pornography,'' laments Norton's character. ``Now, it's the Horchow
Collection.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet you'll also spot such brand names as Starbucks coffee,
Krispy Kreme donuts and Apple computers throughout the film because
those companies contracted with the studio behind ``Fight Club,''
Twentieth Century Fox, for product placement.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' explores the spiritual emptiness of
tastefully appointed, color-coordinated suburban living. But even
Spacey's Lester's rebellion against this empty world involves
acquiring stuff: a cherry red 1970 Firebird, a fancy
battery-operated toy car, etc. You could even argue that the
teen-age cheerleader Lester lusts after is another aquisition he
hopes to make.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Three Kings,'' clueless American soldiers who've just
fought to save Persian Gulf oil for democracy engage in detailed
debates about the merits of competing luxury cars and discuss the
superior tensile strength of Louis Vuitton luggage. On a literal
treasure hunt, they discover vast caches of looted luxury goods in
Iraqi bunkers. Then they discover that such merchandise means very
little when the real things of life are at stake.
</P>
<P>
   A similar realization befalls the pampered young wife Ashley
Judd plays in the hit revenge comedy ``Double Jeopardy.'' She
begins the movie all Armani-clad, on the redwood deck of her
fabulous Puget Sound home, watching the birthday present from her
financier husband sail up to the dock. After she's falsely
imprisoned for murdering said spouse, the woman loses all interest
in possessions, devoting all her energy to vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in nearby ``Mumford,'' a young computer billionaire
can't buy true companionship and an investor's neglected wife fills
her home with mail-order items that she never removes from their
original packaging.
</P>
<P>
   That Hollywood should finally discover what every generation in
human history has come to realize is amusing. That it seems so
heartfelt, coming from such an overpaid and overindulged lot, is
surprising.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that such a swarm of movies is addressing
long-unexamined attitudes indicates that serious consideration is
indeed going on. Obviously, with the end of the century looming,
people are in a self-assessing mood. Moreover, there are good
historical reasons why several different generations of Americans
should be questioning mindless materialism at this point in their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   The three most severely critical films _ ``Beauty,'' ``Fight''
and ``Kings'' _ come from relatively young directors in the early
stage of their careers: Sam Mendes, David Fincher and David O.
Russell, respectively. They're also artists who don't make films
according to the commercial, escapist formulas that the industry is
geared for marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a group of young filmmakers who are reflecting society
to us, directors willing to take chances in showing us the life we
lead and the world in which we live, as opposed to more escapist
fare,'' observes Paul Junger Witt, one of ``Kings' '' producers.
``With few exceptions, films of the last few years have been
over-bloated, effects-driven pieces that taught us very little
about ourselves, if anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is, hopefully, a reversal of that, to films that are more
content- and story-driven,' Witt continues, then adds in regard to
``Three Kings,'' ``I think there's a great deal of irony and humor,
for example, in the excess that's found in these bunkers in these
small, poor Iraqi villages.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the young recruits played by Ice Cube, Mark Wahlberg and
Spike Jonze in ``Kings'' would be just about the age of the
alienated corporate dweeb Norton plays in ``Fight Club.'' According
to the actor, his contemporaries have been uniquely indoctrinated
into a ``buy-and-be-happy'' frame of mind, and are now at the age
when accumulated life experience makes that credo harder and harder
to, well, buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a broad generational crisis, having been the first
generation really raised from the cradle on television and having
had our value system to a great degree _ to a disturbing degree _
informed by an advertising culture that says, `These are the
signifiers of your life that will make you happy,' '' Norton
reckons. ``You reach a point, growing up, where you realize you
have a lot of things but you're still not happy. Then you have to
come to grips with the emptiness of that promise that can't be
fulfilled, and free yourself from the cocoon of this idea that
you're going to be defined by your possessions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' deals with characters who are both older and
younger than those in ``Fight Club.'' Fortysomethings seek the
youthful joy materialism and the soul-killing work that supports it
have squelched (tellingly, both ``Beauty'' and ``Fight Club'' have
major scenes in which jobs are shoved _ but lavish severance
packages are pragmatically procured). The film's teen-agers hunger
for the meaning they see missing in their parents' lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has an idea about what the American dream is,''
notes Spacey. ``This film deals with a lot of those ideals and
images, either the seeking of money and success and comfort or, in
my character's case, the decision to break away from all of that
stuff and not give a s--- about it anymore. Maybe the point is
that, for all that search for things outside of ourselves, at the
end of the day the things that are important are really much closer
_ sometimes, they're actually inside of you.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of inner peace and realization is, sometimes, a
bumpy and rocky road for a lot of people to take. But, ultimately,
it's not about status and it's not about how much you can buy. It's
about things that are much simpler.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Kasdan and Bruce Beresford, the directors of
``Mumford'' and ``Double Jeopardy,'' are from a still older
generation _ one that remembers both the mass rejection of
capitalist materialism in the 1960s and how its youthful rebels
came crawling back as yuppie scum a decade later.
</P>
<P>
   Kasdan, in fact, made the definitive movie on the subject, ``The
Big Chill,'' in 1983. It was a hit at the time, and one of the few
released by a Hollywood studio for the next 15-odd years that would
be built around human stories and filmmakers' personal visions.
Movies themselves became such marketing-driven products in the '80s
and '90s that guys like Kasdan and Beresford felt like strangers in
their own artform.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movies of the '70s wanted to tackle the most complicated
ideas they could figure out, but the '90s thing was the simpler the
better, let's not challenge the audience,'' Kasdan observes. ``It
became a merchandizing situation: How do you maximize the number of
people who will go to the office the next day and say, `Oh, I had
the best time at that movie.' ''
</P>
<P>
   While ``Mumford'' bombed and ``Jeopardy,'' the most
conventionally entertaining of the movies mentioned, is the biggest
popular hit, both ``Beauty'' and ``Kings'' have enjoyed respectable
audience response. ``Fight Club,'' which topped the box-office last
week, is already a cultural success, having been the subject of
much debate in the media before the first ticket was sold.
</P>
<P>
   But does any of this mean that studios are going to continue
bashing the very consumer culture that they thrive on? Maybe, but
don't be surprised if something else that Hollywood has always
excelled at producing _ hypocrisy _ is part of the merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   After all, as Norton jokes, some things about this
art-and-commerce business (and, probably, human nature) are never
going to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did a major spring cleaning,'' the actor says when asked if
``Fight Club'' inspired him to reject his own stuff. ``I got rid of
ALL of last season's clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``But don't ask Brad to give up his GMC Yukon.'' &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Studios that are part of multibillion-dollar
marketing conglomerates putting out movies that essentially say
``commercialism is bad''? Please.
</P>
<P>
   Consider these facts:
</P>
<P>
   _ Talent agency powerhouse Creative Artists Agency recently
bought an approximately 50 percent stake in an ad firm, saying they
would integrate popular culture into marketing and branding
strategies for corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   _ William Morris is marrying such corporate clients as Tommy
Hilfiger with such film companies as Miramax, who agree to shill
their goods in teen-targeted pictures.
</P>
<P>
   _ Twentieth Century Fox, the studio behind ``Fight Club,''
started looking for product placement well over a year ago
(certainly, the controversial movie wasn't many image-conscious
advertisers' cup of tea), and the film's director, David Fincher,
comes from a background of making commercials and music videos _
the latter, of course, advertisements for recordings.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have movies that cost so much, you have to look for
product placement,'' says Emanuelle Boarde, head of marketing for
``Fight Club'' production company New Regency. (``Fight Club''
reportedly cost $65 million.)
</P>
<P>
   Look quickly near the film's very end for some subtle placement
for Puma, maker of tennis shoes and athletic gear. That's no
accident: New Regency holds a 32 percent stake in Puma. ``We're not
going to force Puma into movies where it doesn't fit,'' Boarde
says, ``but they place Puma product as much as they can. Of course,
a lot of it ends up on the cutting-room floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the press's often snide attitude toward product
placement, most moviegoers don't seem to mind it as long as it
doesn't seem inappropriate and forced. The truth is, movies look
contrived if they (BEGIN ITAL)don't(END ITAL) feature real
products, since we all use them and see them and want them in real
life. And if companies will contribute toward a budget that brings
us all more lavish movies ... where's the harm?
</P>
<P>
   So if Hollywood is actually more closely linked to the
commercial business than ever, why the on-screen backlash?
</P>
<P>
   Bob Kronovet, co-founder of Santa Monica commercial production
firm Gun for Hire, has some theories about why film directors may
have a love-hate relationship with commercials, even as more and
more directors are crossing back and forth between both media. His
firm employs many directors with extensive film and television
credits to direct commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are good reasons people want to direct commercials: A TV
commercial is probably the most expensive production there is, with
300 to 400 grand being spent for 30 seconds of film ... Plus, it's
more time than they usually get to concentrate on particular
scenes,'' Kronovet says.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, says Kronovet, ``Commercials are a very
collaborative process. You're constantly being watched and
second-guessed as a director. This kind of committee-oriented
production has never been easy for creative people.'' Still, that
hasn't stopped hip directors, from Spike Lee to Kevin Smith, from
making forays into the 30-second ad.
</P>
<P>
   Could directors like Fincher be taking slick revenge on the
business that nurtured them? Possibly. But we have to realize that
it's all really a joke. Art and commerce reside no more closely
anywhere on Earth than in the movie business. &QL;

A DIFFERENT FACE ON PHOTOGRAPHY 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

By REED JOHNSON 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It hangs there like an awkward question mark,
silently interrogating your humanity. Titled ``Pupil: Pose 1,''
it's a photo-portrait by Katherine Wetzel and Elizabeth King of
what appears to be a cyborg or mannequin in thoughtful repose.
</P>
<P>
   Patently artificial yet indisputably lifelike, everything about
this creature's face _ the pensive mouth, the averted eyes, the
slender prosthetic hand cradling the chin _ suggests the spark of
human consciousness. If this androgynous replicant could talk, you
suspect it might say: ``I look as though I feel _ therefore, I
am.''
</P>
<P>
   Is this the face of virtual emotion, merely, or the real thing?
What makes this cyborg's sensitive countenance any less expressive
of a unique identity than the flickers of anger, love, pity and
terror that regularly transform our own features?
</P>
<P>
   Those are a few of the complex themes raised by ``Pupil: Pose
1,'' one of approximately 175 works in the exhibition ``Ghost in
the Shell'' _ Photography and the Human Soul, 1850-2000, which
opens today at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by photography curator Robert A. Sobieszek, this
multimedia show of prints, books and videos, based on 30 years of
research, examines the history of photographic representations of
human identity, personality, character or selfhood _ call it what
you will.
</P>
<P>
   Since at least the time of Aristotle _ who supposedly advised
Alexander the Great to pick his commanders according to their
facial characteristics _ Western culture has construed the face as
the locus of human identity. While modern and postmodern art has
subdivided and compartmentalized the human body, and the Internet
has splintered it into pixels, the face has remained pre-eminent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the premise behind LACMA's exhibition derives from
centuries-old notions of human individuality which _ thanks to
recent advances in robotics, artificial intelligence and the
construction of technology-based ``virtual identities'' _ are
increasingly up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   While by no means exclusive to Western art, facial
representation has long been a key element of Western culture: from
busts of Roman senators to daguerrotypes of 19th-century writers,
Picasso's cubist ``anti-portraits'' and Andy Warhol's
deer-in-the-headlights Polaroids of Hollywood stars.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``face-reading'' existed in ancient Asian cultures,
facial qualities were generally used to indicate nobility and
social standing rather than to signify individual uniqueness,
according to Sobieszek.
</P>
<P>
   ``To read subjectivity and character, especially moral character
(in a face), is pretty much a Western thing,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, photographers weren't the first to propose that the
face could serve as a medium for documenting emotion. Greek and
Roman artists, followed by Renaissance painters and sculptors,
developed the idea that the face was a mirror of the soul, an
external manifestation of the inner man or woman.
</P>
<P>
   Yet by the late 1830s, when photography was born, the
``science'' or pseudoscience of face-reading had attained a
cultlike status, Sobieszek writes in the exhibition catalog. In
Europe, scientists, physicians and philosophers had codified the
idea that human subjectivity could be read from facial features
(physiognomy), the shape of the skull (phrenology), or the
expression of the emotions (pathognomy).
</P>
<P>
   Enter a Paris neurophysician named G.-B. Duchenne de Boulogne,
who believed that by applying electroshock probes to specific
muscles of the human face _ then photographing the results _ it was
possible to scientifically evoke and document the full range of
human emotional expression.
</P>
<P>
   When Duchenne published his experiments in 1862 in ``Mecanisme
de la physionomie humaine,'' along with a set of photographic
plates, his motives were as much artistic as scientific. Duchenne
hoped painters would use his book as a guide to depicting
anatomically correct facial expressions.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Duchenne, it was very much a wish to have painters do as
beautiful portraits as they (could) but still without lying about
how the muscles really act,'' Sobieszek says.
</P>
<P>
   As 19th-century theories of art, medicine and social science
converged, photos were taken of manic-depressives, tuberculosis
patients, criminals, Jews, subjected colonial peoples and
immigrants newly arrived in the United States and Western Europe.
Doctors, police departments, advocates of racist ``eugenics''
theories and others attempted to use photography to document common
facial features from which archetypes could be constructed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They developed theories by observation: Look at enough
criminals, and if they all have a characteristic that's common,
that's a criminal characteristic,'' Sobieszek explains. ``Thereby
you can take that characteristic and apply it to somebody else and
say, `You must be, if not a criminal, you have the propensity to be
a criminal.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ghost in the Shell'' demonstrates that the use of photography
to certify ``acceptable'' (BEGIN ITAL)or ``unacceptable''(END ITAL)
forms of humanity was brutally alive and well as recently as the
1970s, when the Khmer Rouge made photo-portraits of its prisoners
before sending them off to the killing fields.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the 19th century, however, physiognomy had been
largely discredited, along with the belief in photography as an
objective record of subjective emotions.
</P>
<P>
   In its place arose the modernist conviction that art wasn't
primarily about the subject; it was about projecting onto the
subject whatever personal obsessions or aesthetic concerns the
artist (and by implication, the viewer) wanted to project.
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously, new artistic models of human psychology argued
that reality could be invented in our minds, that the human eye
projects out as much as it takes in.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting new conception of photographic portraiture
persisted well into the 1960s and, in many ways, is still with us,
Sobieszek says.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see a beautiful portrait of Leonardo DiCaprio or Kate
Moss, you project your notion of beauty or handsomeness or
sexuality. I call it the reversal of subjectivity. If I'm Duchenne,
I'm trying to find out what's inside of you. If I'm August Sander,
I'm taking a picture from my point of view to do what I want to do.
If I'm Edward Weston or (Laszlo) Moholy-Nagy, I'm trying to express
the lighting composition, or whatever I want to express.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference between these two phases of art photography can
be seen in a comparison of two exhibition works: Alexander Hesler's
1860 print of Abraham Lincoln and Andy Warhol's 1964
``Self-Portrait.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hesler's work, we're meant to infer from Lincoln's meditative
eyes and heavy brow _ etched in concern over weighty national
matters, no doubt _ that this is a man of character. Even the
photo's somber sepia palette speaks of Lincoln's presumed moral
substance.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Warhol's strip of four pasty-faced mug shots,
snapped in an automated photo booth, delights in obscuring its
nominal subject. Warhol's social status, occupation, and age _ let
alone what's on his mind _ are murky. He could be famous (or at
least notorious), or he could be a nobody. The image refuses to
say. Only the picture's teasing surface matters, not the feelings
of the virtually anonymous human being underneath.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition's third phase deals with the beginnings of
postmodern photo-portraiture in the late 1970s. Sobieszek decided
the key figure in this section would be Cindy Sherman, the popular
U.S. artist who has spent virtually her entire career photographing
herself made up as various fictional personae.
</P>
<P>
   Sobieszek contends that with Sherman's quixotic,
self-dramatizing images, photographic portraiture has come full
circle with Duchenne's ``experimental visual theater'' of
electroshock volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cindy Sherman, I think, epitomizes the dissociation and the
multiplicities that postmodernist artists are dealing with,'' he
says. ``I think that whole idea of dissimulating, storytelling,
narrative fictions and willing complicity between the artist and
the viewer goes back to almost the very beginnings.''
</P>
<P>
   When Sobieszek first came across Duchenne's images more than 30
years ago, he was reminded of old Hollywood ``Frankenstein''
movies. Yet the cliche of a mad scientist using machines to
stimulate human consciousness no longer seems like pure science
fiction.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition's title comes from Masamune Shirow's futuristic
novel, ``Ghost in the Shell,'' in which a cyborg wonders whether
its own personality is real or artificial. Today, some scientists
assert, it's only a matter of time before the ineffable human soul
can be downloaded onto computer software _ putting the ghost into
the machine, as it were.
</P>
<P>
   A scary and anti-humanist possibility?
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absolutely anti-humanist _ in the classical sense of the
word,'' Sobieszek agrees. ``And I think we might have to
re-evaluate or rethink how we define humanism. Because how many
prostheses or synthetics do we put in ourselves? And how much
emotion and intelligence do we put into machines before there is no
difference?''

   DAYTON, Ohio _ The tail rotor sat on sawhorses for more than a
year before mechanics installed it on the helicopter Lt. Col. Allen
E. Oliver and Capt. Robert E. Edwards flew on March 1, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six minutes after takeoff, the tail rotor fell off, and
the AH-1W Super Cobra fell 1,000 feet into a Georgia pine forest,
killing the two Marines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't understand coming out of the factory like that
and having a major mishap,'' said Oliver's father, Edward, who
served in the Pacific as a Marine during World War II. ``Whenever
you're in combat, you know the risk. Accidents happen, but this one
here I felt should never have happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two lives were lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver and Edwards died because the system used to maintain
military aircraft is itself broken.
</P>
<P>
   An 18-month Dayton Daily News examination linked hundreds of
incidents, ranging from in-flight emergencies to major crashes, to
maintenance errors: work performed by unqualified mechanics, parts
installed improperly, engines overhauled incorrectly, aircraft
shoddily inspected.
</P>
<P>
   Never-before-released computer records identified ``improperly
installed'' parts in 632 emergencies and accidents occurring in the
Air Force between 1972 to 1997. Of those cases, 83 were major
accidents, killing 79 people and permanently injuring nearly 200.
</P>
<P>
   And there are indications the military's aviation maintenance
problems are worsening as the services struggle with the loss of
thousands of experienced mechanics, aging aircraft, lack of spare
parts and global conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   More than 25 percent of the Marine Corps squadron assigned to
support the President's aircraft fleet _ typically where the
military sends its best mechanics _ consisted of Marines just out
of training, says a 1996 study the administration ordered after
several incidents involving the White House fleet.
</P>
<P>
   A Sept. 19, 1996, report from the Air Force Audit Agency also
found that 107 of the 210 maintenance personnel the Air National
Guard listed as fully qualified ``had not received mandatory
skill-level training on over 1,400 tasks.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper's computer analysis found that in the Air Force,
the only service to specifically track such cases,
maintenance-related incidents more than doubled between 1992 and
1997, while the number attributed to other causes dropped by half.
In a single year, from 1996-1997, maintenance-related incidents
increased 58 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not as skilled as we want to be. There's no question,''
said Col. Jack Leonard, who oversees aircraft maintenance policy
for the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   Many mechanics have moved on
</P>
<P>
   With the end of the Cold War, tens of thousands of the
military's most skilled mechanics left the services, some victims
of massive downsizing and others lured away by the expanding
civilian aviation industry.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, the Air Force lost 19 percent of its mechanics
overall, among them thousands of the most experienced ones. But, at
the same time, the ranks of the least experienced mechanics, those
still in training, increased by 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With these changes came an increase in maintenance-related
incidents.
</P>
<P>
   On June 12, 1993, just 12 minutes after takeoff, Lt. Kenneth
Duke Jr. was flying a National Guard F-15A fighter not far from the
New Orleans skyline when he realized he was losing control of the
airplane.
</P>
<P>
   As Duke struggled with the controls, the plane went into a nose
dive at 310 miles an hour, rolling left and right as it fell from
the sky.
</P>
<P>
   At 8,500 feet, while the plane flew out of control, Duke hit his
head on the cockpit canopy as he ejected, causing a severe head
injury that has left him unable to speak properly or fully control
the movement of his arms and legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some things worse than death,'' said Duke's father,
the Rev. Kenneth Duke, pastor of a New Orleans-area church. ``He
has been robbed of everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see, we love him so much. It's not fair for him to suffer
that much.''
</P>
<P>
   Months before the accident, investigators found, someone forgot
to install a small metal cotter pin that helps secure one of the
jets's most critical flight controls. Without the pin, a device
allowing the pilot to control the movement of the horizontal tail
surface disconnected, leaving Duke helpless to guide the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could it possibly be inspected and not noticed?'' a
mechanic was asked during the Guard's crash investigation. ``Do you
suppose that that would suggest that somebody just wrote their name
down and said they inspected it and hadn't actually looked at it?''
</P>
<P>
   The mechanic responded, ``Yes, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the mechanics who worked on those flight controls, the
investigation found, ``received no flight control system training
other than being qualified to lubricate components.''
</P>
<P>
   Other mechanics, the report found, ``had not even been entered
into a training status for such basic aircraft maintenance
functions as the operation of aerospace ground equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Francis C. Gideon Jr., commander of the Air Force
Safety Center, reviewed records from the New Orleans crash at the
request of the Dayton Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statements (in the report) are accurate,'' he said. ``I
have no comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Training for mechanics has been reduced
</P>
<P>
   The experienced mechanics who have left the services are being
replaced by people getting less time in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   During the past 20 years, the services cut by up to one-half the
length of training required for aviation mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're talking about how many hours they spend at the
schoolhouse ... that's decreased,'' said Col. Leonard, chief of the
Air Force's Maintenance Management Division.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, young Navy and Air Force recruits still in
initial training _ more than 2,000 of them at a time in the Air
Force alone _ are being used to maintain aircraft primed for live
missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to teach you the theory of how brakes worked. Now
they just teach you how to change brakes. They don't care if you
know how brakes work,'' said Don Delk, who recently retired after
spending 22 years as an Air Force maintenance officer.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Cmdr. Erich Blunt, who oversees training of
enlisted mechanics for the Navy, spent 16 weeks in a maintenance
course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today it's 10 weeks,'' he said. ``The enlisted courses have
been cut'' too.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, a Navy mechanic spent from two to five months in
initial training; today, the training lasts from one to
two-and-a-half months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we do it that way is to save money,'' Blunt said.
</P>
<P>
   Military commanders insist that they have done more with less.
Despite the significant losses of experienced mechanics and the
reduction in training, they said, they have a better work force,
shaped through on-the job training.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're getting is a much better trained mechanic,''
Leonard said.
</P>
<P>
   Shops shorthanded, workload great
</P>
<P>
   The military had a plan to deal with the influx of inexperienced
personnel: Watch them closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always have a lot of young people. Of course you got to
let them work on aircraft,'' said Delk, the retired maintenance
officer. ``It boils down to supervision. You can't let them work
unsupervised.''
</P>
<P>
   But in several cases examined by the Dayton Daily News, shops
were so shorthanded and the workload so great that critical repairs
were made by the only mechanics available, qualified or not.
</P>
<P>
   A Navy investigation into a Feb. 12, 1990, accident involving an
AH-1W Super Cobra helicopter in California found: ``Only 25 percent
of the squadron maintenance personnel were school-trained and
qualified on the AH-1W. These personnel were mainly in supervisory
positions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps F-18 Hornet that Capt. Mark R. Nickles and Maj.
Danny A. D'Eredita crashed off the coast of South Korea on Feb. 9,
1997, was maintained by what a commander called a ``very junior''
squadron that suffered from an ``experience void, especially in the
supervisory role.''
</P>
<P>
   Young corporals, the commander wrote, were allowed to inspect
the work of other mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the experience problems were other problems typical
to military maintenance units: 12-hour shifts, operating in a
temporary overseas deployment, lack of spare parts, newly assigned
mechanics unfamiliar with their co-workers and what the military
describes as a ``high operational tempo,'' a demanding and intense
training operation.
</P>
<P>
   Both pilots died.
</P>
<P>
   When Nickles, 29, and D'Eredita, 38, took off that day, the
squadron's mechanics were in violation of a directive to service
the plane's oxygen system. The directive, which followed complaints
from other F-18 pilots, reduced the interval for servicing the
oxygen system to every 400 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The F-18 carrying Nickles and D'Eredita was overdue for
servicing by 149 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark and I were real close,'' his mother, Barbara Kaliszek,
said during an interview at her Phoenix home, where a large
photograph of her smiling son on his honeymoon hangs on the
refrigerator. ``For me, it's never going to get better. You just
have to learn to live with the pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason I went to work was because I was afraid to
stay in the house by myself _ of taking my own life.''
</P>
<P>
   Navy investigators acknowledged that the oxygen system could
have failed. But Rear Admiral Frank M. ``Skip'' Dirren Jr.,
commander of the safety center in Norfolk, Va., insisted that the
plane was flying too low to make the oxygen system critical to the
pilots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we did a good investigation,'' Dirren said. ``We
think we found the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Navy determined that both pilots passed out at the same time
from the effects of G-forces, pressure on the body produced by the
acceleration of the aircraft. The Navy made its determinations
without recovering the wreckage or the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're convinced it was G lock, and we made a decision not to
recover'' the wreckage, Dirren said.
</P>
<P>
   An investigator wrote that even if the bodies and wreckage were
recovered, ``it is doubtful that it would produce new evidence to
dispute the first listed opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Nickles' stepfather, Andrew Kaliszek, who holds a Ph.D. in
mechanical engineering and is a scientist who conducts research on
aircraft guidance systems, strongly suspects problems with the
oxygen system could have enhanced the effects of the G-forces on
the pilots. Lack of oxygen, he said, can make a pilot more
susceptible to the effects of G-forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I believe happened,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen days after Nickles and D'Eredita were killed, another
F-18 from their squadron reported a ``complete on-board oxygen
generating system failure in flight.''
</P>
<P>
   System prone to failure
</P>
<P>
   Having the most highly trained and experienced mechanics working
under close supervision doesn't guarantee safety. Sometimes the
system itself is broken.
</P>
<P>
   On July 20, 1990, Allison Engine Co., which makes engines for
the Army's OH-58 Kiowa Warrior helicopter, warned its civilian and
military customers to replace a fuel line with a thicker tube, one
that would not break so easily. Allison issued a bulletin that
required replacement of the old tube by no later than June 30,
1991, or within the next 50 hours of operation, whichever came
first, and warned that failure of the old tubes could cause ``power
loss.''
</P>
<P>
   The old tube, Allison warned, ``is susceptible to a higher
failure rate than other similar tubes.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly seven years later, on June 19, 1997, an Idaho National
Guard OH-58 helicopter, on a flight to help flood victims, lost
power and fell from the sky, striking a fence post and rupturing a
fuel tank just before it crashed and burst into flames.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fire was so bad at first you couldn't see anything but
fire,'' a witness told accident investigators, adding that one of
the crew members screamed, `` `Help me. Help me. ... Get me away
from the fire.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Don Baxter, 41, who had just taken command of the state's
flood relief effort, and Lt. Will Neal, 29, married and the father
of a young daughter, were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Unsatisfied that the Army's public report did not pinpoint a
cause, the Idaho National Guard sent the engine to a civilian
company, R.J. Waldron &AMP; Co. Ltd. of British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The Waldron report, released by the Army, blamed the crash on
the same faulty fuel tube Allison had warned about seven years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``No formal information was available as to whether or not the
Army was using the new part ... or if they had been informed of the
change,'' the Waldron report says.
</P>
<P>
   The Army refused to comment on the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes solutions get lost in the military's huge bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 30, 1990, a CH-53E Super Stallion helicopter from Marine
Medium Helicopter Squadron 164 at North Island, Calif., reported a
potentially deadly problem with the tail rotor. Almost immediately
investigators requested a Hazardous Material Report, setting in
motion a warning intended to prevent an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two weeks later, on Feb. 12, a CH-53E from Marine Heavy
Helicopter Squadron 461, also in California, was headed for a
landing zone with eight passengers and four crew members when Capt.
Michael P. Nagelin heard a noise and felt the helicopter shudder.
</P>
<P>
   The tail rotor stopped spinning and the helicopter crashed,
injuring one soldier standing near the landing site and inflicting
what the Navy estimated at more than $900,000 damage.
</P>
<P>
   Navy investigators determined that a tail rotor coupling, the
same part that triggered the Hazardous Material Report two weeks
earlier, had failed.
</P>
<P>
   On March 7, 1990 _ more than three weeks after the crash _
Squadron 461 received the Hazardous Material Report from Squadron
164 concerning potential problems with the tail rotor coupling on
CH-53E helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were happy to have survived,'' Nagelin said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, he said, the military made a determination before
his accident that the problem wasn't serious enough to warrant more
action, and he didn't completely disagree with that decision. In
other cases, Nagelin said, the military has waited too long to fix
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wait till somebody dies, and then they do something about
it,'' said Nagelin, who once served as a Marine Corps aviation
safety officer. ``That was the general feeling in the fleet,
especially when money was tight.
</P>
<P>
   ``They fly it and watch it. ... They're not fixing it. All
they're doing is telling us to work with it. Rather than make the
fix, to save money, you live with the hazard.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Hundreds of military aviation incidents _ ranging
from in-flight emergencies to major crashes _ are linked to
maintenance errors, the Dayton Daily News found in an analysis of
never-before-released computer records from the military.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper found examples of work performed by unqualified
mechanics, parts installed improperly, engines overhauled
incorrectly and shoddy inspections.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force database identified ``improperly installed'' parts
in 632 emergencies and accidents between 1972 to 1997. Of those
cases, 83 were major accidents, killing 79 people and permanently
injuring nearly 200.
</P>
<P>
   The problems also seem to be worsening, as the services continue
to need rigorous training while struggling with the loss of
thousands of experienced pilots and mechanics, aging aircraft, lack
of spare parts and global conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper's computer analysis found that in the Air Force,
the only service to specifically track such cases,
maintenance-related incidents more than doubled between 1992 and
1997, while the number attributed to other causes dropped by half.
In a single year, from 1996 to 1997, maintenance-related incidents
increased 58 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not as skilled as we want to be. There's no question,''
said Col. Jack Leonard, who oversees aircraft maintenance policy
for the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   At least some of the increase in maintenance-related incidents
can be attributed to downsizing. Since 1994, the Air Force lost 19
percent of its mechanics, including thousands of the most
experienced members of their maintenance crews. At the same time,
the ranks of the least experienced mechanics increased by 35
percent, the newspaper found.
</P>
<P>
   With these changes came an increase in maintenance-related
incidents.
</P>
<P>
   The tail rotor sat on sawhorses for more than a year before
mechanics installed it on the helicopter Lt. Col. Allen E. Oliver
and Capt. Robert E. Edwards flew on March .
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six minutes after takeoff, the tail rotor fell off, and
the AH-1W Super Cobra fell 1,000 feet into a Georgia pine forest,
killing the two Marines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't understand coming out of the factory like that
and having a major mishap,'' said Oliver's father, Edward, who
served in the Pacific as a Marine during World War II. ``Whenever
you're in combat, you know the risk. Accidents happen, but this one
here I felt should never have happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two lives were lost.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 12, 1993, just 12 minutes after takeoff, Lt. Kenneth
Duke Jr. was flying a National Guard F-15A fighter not far from the
New Orleans skyline when he realized he was losing control of the
airplane.
</P>
<P>
   As Duke struggled with the controls, the plane went into a nose
dive at 310 miles an hour, rolling left and right as it fell from
the sky.
</P>
<P>
   At 8,500 feet, while the plane flew out of control, Duke hit his
head on the cockpit canopy as he ejected, causing a severe head
injury that has left him unable to speak properly or fully control
the movement of his arms and legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some things worse than death,'' said Duke's father,
the Rev. Kenneth Duke, pastor of a New Orleans-area church. ``He
has been robbed of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Months before the accident, investigators found, someone forgot
to install a small metal cotter pin that helps secure one of the
jets's most critical flight controls. Without the pin, a device
allowing the pilot to control the movement of the horizontal tail
surface disconnected, leaving Duke helpless to guide the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could it possibly be inspected and not noticed?'' a
mechanic was asked during the Guard's crash investigation. ``Do you
suppose that that would suggest that somebody just wrote their name
down and said they inspected it and hadn't actually looked at it?''
</P>
<P>
   The mechanic responded, ``Yes, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the mechanics who worked on those flight controls, the
investigation found, ``received no flight control system training
other than being qualified to lubricate components.''
</P>
<P>
   Other mechanics, the report found, ``had not even been entered
into a training status for such basic aircraft maintenance
functions as the operation of aerospace ground equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Francis C. Gideon Jr., commander of the Air Force
Safety Center, reviewed records from the New Orleans crash at the
request of the Dayton Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statements (in the report) are accurate,'' he said. ``I
have no comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Military officials acknowledge that their maintenance crews are
getting less time in the classroom. During the past 20 years, the
services cut by up to one-half the length of training required for
aviation mechanics, and for the first time Navy and Air Force
recruits still in their initial training are being used to maintain
aircraft primed for live missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to teach you the theory of how brakes worked. Now
they just teach you how to change brakes. They don't care if you
know how brakes work,'' said Don Delk, who recently retired after
spending 22 years as an Air Force maintenance officer.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials say they're dealing with the influx of
inexperienced mechanics by watching them closely. The on-the-job
training also provides a more real-world experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're getting is a much better trained mechanic,''
Leonard said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDS: STORY COULD TRIM HERE)
</P>
<P>
   But in several cases examined by the Dayton Daily News , shops
were so shorthanded and the workload so great that critical repairs
were made by the only mechanics available, qualified or not.
</P>
<P>
   A Navy investigation into a Feb. 12, 1990, accident involving an
AH-1W Super Cobra helicopter in California found: ``Only 25 percent
of the squadron maintenance personnel were school-trained and
qualified on the AH-1W. These personnel were mainly in supervisory
positions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps F-18 Hornet that Capt. Mark R. Nickles and Maj.
Danny A. D'Eredita crashed off the coast of South Korea on Feb. 9,
1997, was maintained by what a commander called a ``very junior''
squadron that suffered from an ``experience void, especially in the
supervisory role.''
</P>
<P>
   Young corporals, the commander wrote, were allowed to inspect
the work of other mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   Both pilots were killed.
</P>
<P>
   As Nickles, 29, and D'Eredita, 38, took off that day, the
squadron's mechanics were in violation of a directive to service
the plane's oxygen system. The directive, which followed complaints
from other F-18 pilots, reduced the interval for servicing the
oxygen system to every 400 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The F-18 carrying Nickles and D'Eredita was overdue for
servicing by 149 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Navy investigators acknowledged that the oxygen system could
have failed. But Rear Admiral Frank M. ``Skip'' Dirren Jr.,
commander of the safety center in Norfolk, Va., insisted that the
plane was flying too low to make the oxygen system critical to the
pilots.

<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Chief Warrant Officer Paul S. Timmer of Hamilton,
Ohio, flew to his death in a helicopter that should never have left
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 25, 1991, Timmer was piloting a UH-1 helicopter carrying
four other people and cargo over El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve days before that crash, an oil sample was taken from a
gearbox on the helicopter and sent to a lab. The lab labeled the
sample with a ``T,'' an Army maintenance code indicating
contamination serious enough to ground the helicopter until the
problem was fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after takeoff, the main rotor began to turn so slowly
that soldiers from another helicopter could count the blades as
they moved. Timmer tried to make an emergency landing on flat land,
but instead the helicopter crashed into a lake.
</P>
<P>
   Timmer and the four others were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen days after the fatal crash, a report alerting mechanics
to ground the helicopter because of the oil contamination problems
was made available to Timmer's unit. Although the crash apparently
was not directly linked to the contaminated oil, the lab report
would have kept the helicopter on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Army spokesman Mark J. Jeude called the delay an ``unacceptable
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have looked at timeliness in our sample results,'' Jeude
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words, five people are dead because somebody didn't
do a report,'' said Steve Timmer, a retired Hamilton police officer
and father of the dead pilot. ``It took them five weeks to get them
out of the lake and get him back to me. I couldn't open the
casket.''

A MEMORABLE JOURNEY WITH `WONDERS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN KOCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every time you wake up, he seems to have produced something new
between hard covers or for the pages of a magazine, notably The New
Yorker. So prolific is Henry Louis Gates Jr. _ cultural reporter,
literary scholar and critic, memoirist, encylopedist _ that you
can't help wondering if the man is many-times cloned or, at least,
grievously hobbled by overwork. For merely one example of his
recent output, the Harvard professor and director of the
university's W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for Afro-American Research
coedited the soon-to-be-published and formidably thick ``Africana:
The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience.''
</P>
<P>
   If he's not a multiple of himself or an imminent burn-out case,
one can only imagine he's a finger-wagging pedant and probably
overbearingly Type A to boot.
</P>
<P>
   Well, wrong again, judging by Gates's most ambitious foray yet
into documentary television, ``Wonders of the African World,''
which debuts Monday night. The three-night, six-hour BBC production
is an unconventional and utterly refreshing look at the continent
through the lens of a curious, informed African-American determined
to celebrate his hyphenated roots without trimming troubling
historical truths.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he revives long-neglected history, including the
reign of the black pharaohs in ancient Nubia, now the Sudan, where
impressive but rarely visited pyramids house 40 generations of
once-powerful kings and queens. That's Monday night, in program
one. In the fourth hour, Tuesday, Gates nimbly explores the vibrant
Christian tradition in Ethiopia, ``the only African nation,'' he
reminds us, ``never to be colonized.'' The episode is treated as
something of a mystery tour, a pursuit of the lost Ark of the
Covenant. The original 10 Commandments, etched into stone tablets,
are presumably in the ancient city of Axum, guarded by a rarely
seen monk.
</P>
<P>
   Gates, who wrote and voiced the film's narration, is also
on-camera much of the time, usually wearing a Harvard T-shirt,
making casual observations, acting as historical guide and
facilitator, meeting and greeting contemporary royals, schmoozing
with random townsfolk, and so on. If his little caravan breaks down
on one or another dusty road, the camera peers into the passenger
window of the stalled vehicle and there he sits, congenially
chatting to you _ being, one supposes, himself.
</P>
<P>
   Astonishingly, Gates's presence never grates _ at least based on
the four hours of ``Wonders'' that I saw. On the contrary, his
easygoing candor and sweet spontaneity set this documentary apart
from others as much as its enlightening contents do.
</P>
<P>
   By engaging history directly and personally, he makes it live in
all of its ambiguous glory and timeless sadness. In Kenya, Gates
draws proud attention to the remarkable accomplishments of the
Swahili, great city-builders, it turns out, in the late 14th
century. But he also confronts their later exploits when,
intermingled with Arabs, they profited handsomely by exporting
spices and slaves.
</P>
<P>
   In an Anglican church in Zanzibar built over the old slave
market, Gates says, ``This place gives me the creeps.'' Behind the
throw-away lightness is deep, unconcealed grief.
</P>
<P>
   And as vocally proud as he is of old African cultures, he never
tires of exposing the prejudices he sees among some African blacks.
</P>
<P>
   In a dialogue with some dark-skinned Zanzibari villagers who
proclaim their Persian ancestry, he says, ``You look African. To
me, the people here look about as Persian as Mike Tyson.''
</P>
<P>
   Episode three, which examines the old West African slave
kingdoms of Dahomey and Asante, where slavery existed even before
Europeans arrived, is crosshatched with pain.
</P>
<P>
   In the city of Ouidah, in modern Benin, we meet African
descendants of the port's wealthiest slave trader who remain
status-conscious aristocrats to this day. Often ironical in his
reflections, here Gates pauses to offer an unadulterated lament:
``I've often thought that Africa has suffered so much, in part
because of its own curse of selling its own people away.''
</P>
<P>
   History is never objective. It is because we experience
``Wonders of the African World'' through Gates's clearly stated
sensibility and emotion, as well as his roaming intelligence, that
it's so engaging and memorable.
</P>
<P>
   There is something keenly, openly American about him, even
including at times an endearing awkwardness, that continually
personalizes this epic and makes it all seem to matter.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps needless to add _ couldn't you have guessed? _ Gates
has written a companion book to the television series, also called
``Wonders of the African World.''

TIME IS RUNNING OUT FOR THE `TEAM OF THE DECADE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Well, if the team of the decade thing doesn't work out
for them, maybe the Atlanta Braves can try not to be confused with
the San Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that may be a bit harsh. After all, the Braves
themselves know how surmountable a 2-0 World Series lead can be,
having been surmounted themselves in just such a fashion three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday's 7-2 loss to David Cone and the New York Yankees as
the forgettable second act to the Team of the Century pageantry
marked the first time since the Braves started dominating the
National League that they looked unworthy of their place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a team of good pitching and timely hitting,'' Atlanta
manager Bobby Cox said, thoroughly befuddled. ``Tonight we didn't
get enough men on base to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox sounding helpless is odd to the ear. The Braves entered this
Team-Of-The-90s spat with the game's best record, the longest
running success story, and only a World Series victory away from
getting what many people believe is their due.
</P>
<P>
   But barring a meaningless ninth-inning rally Sunday, the Braves
have been extraordinarily compliant _ as overwhelmed in their way
as the Padres were when the Yankees swept them last October.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the whelming came at the hand of Cone, which in itself
is a bit strange, given that he has had a circulatory problem that
affects his throwing hand. He had been rested copiously, and
pitched as many day games as the Yankees could arrange.
</P>
<P>
   Yet on another brisk evening at Turner Field, he made liars of
the Braves for seven innings. His worst throw of the night was to
first base (well, right field) on Ozzie Guillen's grounder to the
right of the mound in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Everything else he served up was at least partially reminiscent
of his perfect game earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt strong, really strong,'' Cone said, even admitting that
he himself was impressed by his performance. ``It was just a matter
of not giving in to them, not letting their big hitters get
anything to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, though, haven't had any big hitters for a while now.
``We didn't hit the ball tonight,'' Cox said, ``we didn't hit it
last night (getting two-hit by Orlando Hernandez and three
relievers in a 4-1 loss), and we didn't really tear up the ball
against the Mets, either, so ...''
</P>
<P>
   So what? Well, for starters, what's the surprise there? It's the
World Series, remember? The Braves treat the World Series as a
Wiffle Ball tournament. Cox, fed up by the extended teamwide slump,
changed three men in his lineup Sunday. The result was that catcher
Greg Myers got the Braves' first hit rather than Chipper Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the lineup watched Cone as they watched Orlando
Hernandez the night before, like seventh-graders confronted by
their first trigonometry pop quiz.
</P>
<P>
   But they also didn't pitch for one of the few times in their
postseason history. Right-hander Kevin Millwood, filling in for
Greg Maddux who had filled in for the gastrically distressed Tom
Glavine, provided the backbeat for a conga line of Yankee
baserunners _ six of the first seven he faced, and 10 of 15
overall. By the time he was removed in the third inning, the
Yankees led 3-0, although it may as well have been 33-0 for all the
good it would do the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pretty much sucked,'' Millwood said in a particularly sharp
bit of self-analysis. ``That's about it. It was a really bad game
for me. I could have faced any major league team today and the same
thing would have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   And they surely didn't field. Guillen, another of Cox's fresh
insertions into the dormant Atlanta lineup, mangled two plays by
himself, one a dropped popup from Cone that most Frisbee-catching
dogs handle in their sleep.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the Braves lost their usually loyal crowd, and began
to take on that look of the squirrel in your front yard _ the look
the Padres showed the baseball-speaking world last year after Game
Two.
</P>
<P>
   They cheered lustily when Guillen successfully surrounded
another Cone popup in the fifth, but mostly grumbled to themselves
during the Braves' lightning-fast at-bats. The city had been
roasted by medioids who felt their devotion to their team was soft
and doughy, but mostly they had been led to believe this Series was
going to be even more tense than that series with the Mets. They
hadn't planned on this.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, they didn't see the ugly turn the evening took even
before the game began, just on the basis of Pete Rose's pregame
interview on NBC. He had just received a long and spirited ovation
from the crowd at Turner Field for the not-entirely deserved honor
of being voted one of the best outfielders of the 20th century when
he was then confronted by the network's designated yappy dog, Jim
Gray. The interview quickly degenerated into a quick volley of that
popular board game, ``Admit It! You're Guilty! _ Like Hell I Will,
You Little Twerp!''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange was so mutually petulant that viewers across the
nation had not only nearly forgotten that most of the ceremony was
an impressive tribute to the other honorees, who had richly earned
their props, but were momentarily torn between whether they would
rather hit Rose or Gray in the face with a snow shovel.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd, however, saw only the good vibes from the pregame
show, so much so that they forgot their principal duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ceremony was great, because the fans forgot to get on
me,'' Cone said. ``I expected to get some heckling while I was
warming up, but it was quiet. Everyone was watching that, and it
was great.''
</P>
<P>
   The lesson: If the Team of the Century is helping the Yankees,
what chance do the Braves and their hitting-optional attack have?
Right now, it seems like not much of one at all.

ONE MORE `HURRAH' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a page by itself, just before Chapter 1 of Edwin O'Connor's
``The Last Hurrah,'' is this disclaimer: ``All characters and
situations in this novel are fictional, and any resemblance to any
persons living or dead is purely coincidental.''
</P>
<P>
   But when The Boston Globe mischievously sent a review copy of
the book to James Michael Curley _ this was in 1956, two years
after Curley had lost his final attempt at a comeback in Boston
politics _ the former alderman, state representative, mayor,
congressman, Massachusetts governor, and prison inmate sent back a
note that hinted he would be speaking to his lawyers about a libel
suit. Like countless readers since, Curley saw a good deal of
himself in Frank Skeffington, the novel's central figure _ a
magnetic, shrewd, ruthless, sentimental politician, the
Irish-Catholic mayor of an unnamed ``red-brick city'' just like
Boston _ and professed not to like what he saw.
</P>
<P>
   The threats of lawsuits continued for a while, until Curley's
sons pacified him by pointing out that readers everywhere adored
the character of Skeffington. Before long he had stopped denouncing
the novel and swung to the other extreme, embracing it as his own
life story.
</P>
<P>
   One day, some weeks after ``The Last Hurrah'' came out, O'Connor
spotted Curley climbing into a cab and _ not withpidation _
went over to introduce himself. To his relief, the old man told him
he'd enjoyed the book _ especially ``the part where I die.''
</P>
<P>
   This was not what O'Connor had been expecting, and he tactfully
tried to set Curley straight. ``Isn't it strange, governor, how so
many people confuse fact with fiction?'' he began. ``Skeffington
with yourself, for instance? I know and you know, the difference
between the two, that the one isn't like the other''
</P>
<P>
   But Curley wasn't paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there I am in my bedroom, dying,'' he was saying.
``Breathing my last . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Last Hurrah'' was a tremendous hit; it went through 15
hardcover printings in its first eight months and became the
second-biggest selling novel of 1956. (``Peyton Place'' took the
top slot.) It was a critical success as well. ``Here, after a
century of trying, is the first successful Irish-American novel,''
proclaimed John Kelleher on the cover of The New York Times Book
Review. One day later, Orville Prescott gave it a second rave: ``It
is the best novel about American politics and the best novel about
Irish-Americans I have ever read.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Last Hurrah'' is about Skeffington's last campaign for
mayor, but it is about more than that: It is about the demise of
the era of big-city bosses, about the way television changed
electoral politics, about how the Irish in America climbed out of
their immigrant poverty on a ladder of politics, and about their
clash _ especially in a city like Boston _ with the Yankees and
Brahmins who had arrived long before them.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor filled his tale with irresistible characters, but even
more than that, with irresistible blarney. There is, for instance,
Skeffington on City Hall reporters:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a point of pride with most of our political journalists
that they don't know a great deal about politics; if they did, it
would interfere with what I believe they call their `objective
analyses.' The finest example of an objective analyst we've ever
had was a reporter named Mulrooney who used to write a City Hall
column. He was so objective that he didn't know where City Hall
was. . . . He was widely read and considered one of our leading
authorities on municipal administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Or Charlie Hennessy, an eccentric gadfly, on the mayor:
</P>
<P>
   ``Only last week I wrote letters to the sociologists down at
Yale, Harvard, and Princeton, telling them to get their best men
over here to watch Frank Skeffington in action before it's too
late! Oh yes! Important! I told them to get them over here and
watch him set the buffoons on fire, all laughing and jumping and
cheering and stamping their feet, while he stands up there nodding
his head and in the big air-conditioned voice telling them fifteen
lies and a bedtime story to send them home happy! Marvelous! The
talent is inborn, dear folks! A terrible mayor but a great
entertainer!''
</P>
<P>
   Two years after ``The Last Hurrah'' was published, Columbia
Pictures made it into a movie starring Spencer Tracy. But only now,
41 years later, is it being brought to the stage. It will have its
premier this week at Boston's Huntington Theatre Company, which is
located just a few blocks from the street where Curley was born in
1874. (Disclosure: I volunteer my support as one of the theater's
overseers.)
</P>
<P>
   Curley has been dead for 41 years; politicians of his ilk aren't
being manufactured anymore. And a lucky thing for the Huntington,
too. When the film version of ``The Last Hurrah'' was released,
Curley claimed it was a degrading invasion of his privacy and went
to court to keep it from opening. The studio indignantly replied
that it had paid Curley $25,000 to sign a release, and produced the
document with his signature. All brass, Curley declared the
signature a forgery _ but allowed himself to be appeased with an
additional $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   That was in 1958. One shudders to think what he would have
demanded in 1999 as his price for letting the Huntington bring the
fictional Frank Skeffington to life once more.

WHAT'S A NICE GIRL LIKE ALLY ... 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   David E. Kelley, producer and writer, has a provocation
fixation. He is addicted to pushing buttons, and you can't get very
far into any of his shows _ ``The Practice,'' ``Snoops,'' ``Ally
McBeal'' _ without coming face to face with a handful of gender
slights, at least one social taboo, some sexy language, and, of
course, plenty of leg. Was that defendant on last week's ``The
Practice'' actually exhibiting his genitals to the jury? You
betcha. Despite his neighborhood-boy looks, Mr. Kelley is a
high-powered controversy monger, and he is not as different from
Howard Stern as you (and he) might think.
</P>
<P>
   His showiest show, ``Ally McBeal,'' returns Monday night for its
third season, and the first two episodes are Kelley at his most
incendiary. The fireworks include Ally having anonymous sex in a
car wash; a priest walking in on a cheating bride; Renee and
Whipper forcing men to remove their shirts during job interviews;
and Fish lines like ``I'd like you to walk a mile in her
diaphragm.'' Next week's roster of outrageousness includes Ally and
Ling making out on a romantic date; a cleavage-heavy woman getting
sued for harassment by female co-workers; Elaine providing the
Biscuit with sexual stimulation; and Nelle confessing that she
wants to be spanked in bed. It's all a great big fantasia of sexual
hot spots, wrapped up in some of the glossiest visuals and
narrative devices that you'll find on TV. Men as sex objects, women
as sex objects, men's double standards, women's double standards,
bisexuality, erotic fantasy vs. reality _ hey, let's party!
</P>
<P>
   And that's what ``Ally McBeal'' has become: a racy party, with a
cast of kooky characters, wild plot twists, timely legal cases, and
kicky hairstyles that seem to have a life of their own. Kelley
doesn't resort to Butt Bongo Fiesta _ that would be Howard Stern's
game _ but it's not hard to imagine him taking inspiration for next
week's spanking and lesbian plots from any number of Stern
segments. In the past, it has been fun trying to figure out what
Kelley is saying with all of this, and debating whether the show
portrays real women or only a male fantasy of them, and bringing a
Freudian interpretation to the foam on Fish's latte. But as ``Ally
McBeal'' becomes overcrowded with in-your-face sex and gender
issues, it actually gets less interesting and less provocative.
</P>
<P>
   What makes ``Ally McBeal'' more than titillation is its entirely
original set of characters and their ensemble chemistry, which
culminates in the signature bar sequences. These are some of the
most imaginative creations on TV, and it's hard not to enjoy their
uniqueness, from Ling's massive hat in Monday night's over-the-top
wedding scene to Ally's ``dyke'' outfit next week. And let's not
forget about the Biscuit's whistling nose. The same cast members
are back this season, with no new additions, although it looks like
we'll see more of Lisa Nicoln's Renee and Dyan Cannon's
Whipper, as the two begin a private practice together. It also
looks like Calista Flockhart is developing a new acting style (in
addition to her new full-bodied hairstyle), as she relies less on
her trademark hyperventilating and stammering. Now if she can only
persuade Kelley to slow down his own heavy breathing.

SCHOOL VISITS SERVING BUSH'S CAMPAIGN WELL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush may not have known the
ethnic breakdown of the 525 students at Kimball Elementary School
in this city's Beacon Hill section, but you can bet one or more of
his campaign staffers did.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-three percent of the children are Asian-American, 29
percent are Anglo and most of the remainder are black, a mix that
made Kimball an ideal location for the Republican presidential
candidate's latest photo opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had already visited a heavily Hispanic school in a nearby
city only a couple of hours earlier and been rewarded with a photo
of himself on his hands and knees, shooting marbles with a few of
the kids.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates and their consultants dream of such photos _ the only
thing better is television video _ because they make politicians
seem like real people (almost) and give them an opportunity to
visually portray a chosen message.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has been visiting schools throughout the country since
he launched his national campaign, has more than one message.
</P>
<P>
   The first, according to spokeswoman Karen Hughes, is the
governor's longstanding commitment to improve education, to take
his successes in Texas _ and at least one of his failures (private
school vouchers) _ and expand on them from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the major reasons Governor Bush is running for
president is because we want to leave no child behind. We want to
educate every child, and we want to send a clear message that every
child in America can learn,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   A second message is aimed at people who usually don't vote for
Republicans. To appeal to them, since their support could be
crucial in the general election if Bush is the GOP nominee, the
governor is going to places, such as schools with heavy minority
enrollments, that most Republican political candidates don't visit.
</P>
<P>
   Bush courts the country clubs and boardrooms _ the familiar GOP
terrain _ as well. His record fund-raising success is testimony to
that. But those stops are liberally (for most Republicans)
interspaced with visits to places heavily populated with minorities
with whom the governor can be photographed or about whom he can be
quoted.
</P>
<P>
   One of my colleagues suggested that Bush's visits to minority
schools carry still a third message, closely related to the first
but aimed specifically at traditional Republicans. The governor,
according to this theory, wants to assure conservatives that the
education and welfare changes he is championing will go a long way
toward putting more people into jobs and ending government
handouts.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's interest in schoolchildren undoubtedly is sincere. He
cares about their futures in addition to caring about what they can
do for his immediate, political future. And the children enjoy his
visits, although many of the younger ones don't really know who he
is or why he sits there, surrounded by all those TV cameras,
reading to them.
</P>
<P>
   The cultivation of photo opportunities has been an essential
ingredient of political campaigns as long as there have been
cameras, and they became more pronounced with the advent of
television.
</P>
<P>
   But the politics of such events are transparent, and Bush's are
no exception. In Seattle, the governor recited lines from a
well-worn script, some of which were obviously aimed at reporters,
not at the fourth-graders picked to meet with the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   When one fourth-grader asked Bush what he would do for education
if he were elected president, Bush said he would transfer more
power over the schools from Washington, D.C., to the states and
cities because he believes in ``local control.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely he didn't expect 9- and 10-year-olds to have the foggiest
idea of what he was talking about, although children of that age
have been treated to that answer in several states now.
</P>
<P>
   A few Democratic parents who were volunteering at the school
that day understood the answer but didn't think much of it. After
Bush had departed, they told reporters that the governor had been
there to ``grandstand,'' not to learn about the funding problems
experienced by many Seattle schools, if, indeed, he had any idea
that there were funding problems.
</P>
<P>
   But a color photo of Bush and two of the Kimball students
dominated the front page of one Seattle newspaper the next morning.
And the governor undoubtedly was featured with the children in TV
news clips as well.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, a school had served the Bush campaign well.

 &HT;    CLINTON STOPS FOR PICTURES WITH SAILOR'S BIRTH-DAMAGED SON
 &HT;    With photos

   WASHINGTON _ Georgina Denman believes her severely birth-damaged
son, Tyler, has a ``special and unusual effect'' on people.
</P>
<P>
   It worked on Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The wife of a Navy enlisted man, Denman recently managed to get
a few minutes with Clinton _ by merely asking to see him, even
though she did not have an appointment or advance clearance.
</P>
<P>
   She is convinced Tyler was the reason.
</P>
<P>
   Denman is a member of a small group of active-duty wives who
call themselves ``Casualties of Tricare.'' They have been trying
for several years to get the Defense Department to change a
controversial policy that denies skilled nursing care to some
military dependents on the grounds that their conditions cannot be
improved.
</P>
<P>
   Active-duty and retiree dependents are left to get care through
Medicaid or charity, often a difficult and humiliating process.
</P>
<P>
   When Tyler was born, complications left him without oxygen for
19 minutes. His heart had stopped beating and he was left
neurologically damaged. He is kept alive by a respirator, an array
of monitors and other the machines and the constant attention of a
pediatric nurse.
</P>
<P>
   For three years, the Defense Department's Tricare program paid
for Tyler's nursing care.
</P>
<P>
   However, Denman said, Tricare case managers warned her
repeatedly that they might shift him to ``custodial care'' status.
</P>
<P>
   The term is dreaded by Tricare beneficiaries with children or
other dependents who must have skilled nursing care. Tricare
defines custodial care patients to include those who have no hope
of recovery, even if the care is necessary to keep them alive.
Although the program pays for some benefits, including one doctor
visit a month, it will not pay for skilled nursing care.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1998, Tyler's status was changed and his nursing care
terminated.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of sympathetic Orange County, Calif., officials,
she got him approved for Medicaid. Her husband, Hospital Corpsman
2c John Denman, commutes to his work as an instructor at Camp
Pendleton, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tyler would not survive without this care,'' Georgina Denman
said.
</P>
<P>
   This year, active-duty mothers of disabled children mounted a
campaign to get the Tricare policy changed. Largely because of
their efforts, next year's Defense Department appropriations bill
requires Tricare to provide ``all medically necessary health care
... regardless of the health care status.''
</P>
<P>
   During the mothers' lobbying campaign, Denman came to
Washington, bringing Tyler and his nurse, Temple Fee, to talk with
members of Congress and Tricare officials about the policy.
</P>
<P>
   When she learned Clinton was in a meeting, down the hall from a
reception she was attending, she went to the nearest Secret Service
agent and asked if she could please speak with the president of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him my husband was a Navy corpsman and asked him if
there was any chance in a bahzillion my little boy could see the
president,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Eying Tyler, asleep in his wheelchair, the Secret Service agent
shook his head and explained to her that requests like hers had to
be approved in advance... and he'd really like to help her...and
there was no way... and...well, he'd check.
</P>
<P>
   Denman, Fee, Tyler and Edith Smith, a volunteer military family
advocate, waited in a coffee shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a while, the agent came running in there and told us to
come on and to hurry,'' Denman said.
</P>
<P>
   The agent stationed the group near a door and after a few
minutes Clinton came through.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president came right over and said hello to Temple and
me,'' Denman said. ``I told him I was from Arkansas and I was a
Navy wife we were here to lobby for military health care reform.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Clinton put his hand on Tyler's head and she told him,
``This is my son, Tyler.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tyler, it's an honor to meet you,'' Clinton said as a White
House photographer took pictures.
</P>
<P>
   And her son?
</P>
<P>
   ``Tyler has a strange and wonderful effect on people,'' she
said. ``He's beautiful, and they are attracted to him. But he slept
through the whole thing.''

PREVENT KIDS' HALLOWEEN SUGAR OVERDOSE

   LOS ANGELES _ Halloween is the holiday that puts a kid in his or
her own candy store. Here are some tips on how to help them handle
the candy bonanza:
</P>
<P>
   _ While inspecting the candy for signs of tampering, help the
child weed out candy he or she doesn't really like. Get rid of the
less appealing treats.
</P>
<P>
   _ Limit candy to a few pieces as an after-meal snack.
</P>
<P>
   _ Feed the kids before they go trick-or-treating. This will
discourage snacking while they're out on the candy trail.
</P>
<P>
   _ Set a good example by handing out healthy treats. Granola bars
and single-serving boxes of cereal, nuts and raisins can satisfy a
sweet tooth without all the extra fat and calories in candy bars.
Also, look for low-fat sweets that are more package than candy,
such as SweetTarts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Halloween is a good time to teach kids about healthful eating
habits such as portion control. Just because they have 5 pounds of
candy or a huge plate of french fries, doesn't mean they have to
eat it all. Healthful eating habits will follow them into
adulthood. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ Five-year-old Kaitlin Levinson loves chocolate.
But unlike thousands of San Fernando Valley trick-or-treaters this
weekend, Kaitlin will be giving away most of her tasty Halloween
treats.
</P>
<P>
   It's not an exceptionally refined sense of giving that will
inspire the Studio City kindergartener's charitable act. It's her
mom.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren Levinson set strict rules about Kaitlin's sugar intake to
fend off the onslaught of marketing that urges her daughter to eat
Marshmallow Blasted Froot Loops for breakfast, ``have a Coke and a
smile'' for lunch and ``break me off a piece of that Kit Kat bar''
as an afternoon snack. Truth is, Halloween's candy bonanza is
little more than the icing on an already sugar-saturated world.
</P>
<P>
   Levinson doesn't deny Kaitlin's sweet tooth. She just limits it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a firm believer in moderation,'' Levinson said. ``I
strongly feel that you can't cut your kids _ or anybody _ off from
it because the minute you say no, they want it more. She gets one
treat a day and it has some food value to it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's tough _ if not impossible _ to deny the fun of trick or
treat. But Bonnie Liebman, director of nutrition at the Center for
Science in the Public Interest in Washington, D.C., said the spooky
holiday is a good time for parents to reflect on the sugar that
sneaks into their childrens' daily diet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are drowning in sugars,'' Liebman said. ``As a nation, we
eat 20 percent more sugar than we did in 1983. Much of that jump in
sugar consumption has come from soft drinks. The average teen-ager
used to drink twice as much milk as soda. Now it's the opposite, so
I think it's fair to say the American sweet tooth is out of control
and shows no signs of slowing down.''
</P>
<P>
   On average, Americans take in 20 teaspoons of sugar a day _
double what physicians around the world consider healthy.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that hard to do. Consider this from the CSPI:
</P>
<P>
   _ A serving of Kellogg's Marshmallow Blasted Froot Loops
contains about 40 percent of the USDA's recommended daily allowance
of sugar.
</P>
<P>
   _ A single serving of most fruit yogurts contains about 70
percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ A single 12-ounce Pepsi contains 103 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ A Cinnabon, about 123 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ A large Dairy Queen Mr. Misty Slush, a whopping 280 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jonathan E. Fielding, Los Angeles County public health
director, said the harmful results of the national sugar overload
are not immediately visible in children. Obesity is on the rise in
children and adults, but sugar is only one of many culprits in that
problem. And the rate of cavities in the United States _ the only
immediate risk of too many sweets _ is going down thanks to
fluoride and good dental hygiene habits. But parents who let
children gorge on sweets are setting the stage for a lifetime of
worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very disturbing,'' he said. ``We're making a lot of
progress in a number of other areas _ in smoking, in controlling
cholesterol and high blood pressure _ but unfortunately not in
obesity. Weight increases the risks for a lot of things, for heart
disease or stroke through high blood pressure. Diet may influence
the risk of some cancers.''
</P>
<P>
   Added sugars _ sugars thrown into the mix to make things taste
good _ also lurk in surprising places: fruit juices, Jell-O and
even those tasty fat-free cookies and cakes that claim to be so
good for you.
</P>
<P>
   While there is sugar in fruits, vegetables, milk, and other
natural substances, they also contain fiber, vitamins and minerals
that can fortify the body against heart disease, osteoporosis,
stroke and some cancers.
</P>
<P>
   A Three Musketeers candy bar, on the other hand, is nothing but
a shot of refined sugar and fat _ tasty, but devoid of any
nutritional value. What concerns health officials is that the sweet
treats muscle out healthier foods.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sugar industry is fond of saying all sugars are equal and
once it gets inside your body there's no difference,'' Liebman
said. ``Technically, that's true. But there is a difference between
eating a food like fruit or milk, which is much better for you than
eating a food packed with refined sugar.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, a teen-ager who drinks more soda than milk runs the
risk of developing osteoporosis because he or she isn't getting
enough bone-fortifying calcium before the body stops building bone
density at age 20.
</P>
<P>
   Liebman only allows her own children, ages 6, 10 and 12, to have
sodas when they are sick or on special occasions, such as birthday
parties. She only allows sweet treats after dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, my kids are only allowed desserts after dinner,''
Liebman said. ``I do let them eat more candy than usual when they
get home from trick-or-treating. I think making too big a fuss is
counterproductive.''
</P>
<P>
   She said most parents lose control between meals, when an
``anything goes'' attitude tends to prevails.
</P>
<P>
   To raise awareness among consumers as to how big an impact even
small snacks can have on a person's overall sugar intake, the
Center for Science in the Public Interest is pushing the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration to include ``added sugars'' on nutritional
labels so consumers can see for themselves the sources of this
sugar overload.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is Coca-Cola spends $100 million a year to promote
Coke Classic alone and the National Cancer Institute spends $1
million a year on its 5 A Day program encouraging people to eat
more fruits and vegetables,'' Liebman said. ``It's very hard to
combat those pressures to eat sugary foods in large quantities.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaitlin Levinson is no exception. This summer she succumbed to
the ready availability of sodas at her day camp. But because her
mother started working to control her sugar consumption early,
Kaitlin dutifully reported each time she broke her mom's
two-soda-a-week rule.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren Levinson let Kaitlin have extra sodas, but cut her off on
weekends. After all, it's tough for a 5-year-old to say no when the
other children are gulping sodas. But Levinson also went to the
camp directors and lobbied them to reduce the number of sweets and
soft drinks available next summer.
</P>
<P>
   She uses a similar tactic to avoid pre-Halloween candy snacking:
If the favored sweets aren't there, no one can fall into the sugar
trap.
</P>
<P>
   Since her husband, Dan, and her daughter are both incurable
``chocaholics,'' Levinson buys a big mixed bag of non-chocolate
candies from Costco.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get a ton of kids here,'' Levinson said. ``I basically buy
stuff she doesn't like so it eliminates the battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is going to be junk food in this world,'' she said.
``It's a matter of learning how to balance it all.'' &QL;

49ERS DEFENSIVE LINE GETTING NOWHERE SLOWLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JEFFRI CHADIHA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ The defensive line of the San Francisco 49ers
doesn't know what to say anymore. They're tired of the questions
and just as discouraged by their own endless search for answers
</P>
<P>
   Each week, they line up prepared to chase after opposing
quarterbacks. Each week, they're left to wonder why a front four
can be walled off so easily and so often. The team's 40-16 loss to
the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday only added to the mystery.
</P>
<P>
   As has been the case with several quarterbacks this season,
Minnesota's Jeff George had enough time to find his relatives in
the sold-out Metrodome crowd before unleashing his passes. The
49ers recorded only one sack _ by Bryant Young in the first quarter
_ and even that came so early that it was forgotten in the rest of
the mess.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating,'' 49ers defensive tackle Junior Bryant said.
``We know we're putting our secondary in a bad position. You can't
give a guy like Jeff George that kind of time to throw the ball.
You can't give any quarterback that much time. We just haven't been
doing our jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this season, the 49ers secondary has taken most of
the blame for the team's defensive troubles. The cornerbacks are
small, but easy targets. But, as any coach will tell you,
consistent pressure on a quarterback can do wonders for a defensive
back's ego. Without it, even the most subtle flaws in the defensive
backfield will stand out.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers haven't had anything resembling a pass rush this
season, as their 13 sacks prior to this loss attest. They've had
massive men hurling their bodies into unimpressed guards and
tackles, getting nowhere slowly, dismantling nothing in the other
team's offensive game plan. George threw for 250 yards and three
touchdowns. Rarely did he have to worry about his health.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest part for the 49ers to stomach was that of any game,
this was one where they needed their front four to produce.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings' potent passing attack demanded that the 49ers play
more nickel and dime defenses than normal. Therefore, the blitzing
that had helped the pass rush in previous games had to be kept to a
minimum unless the team wanted to expose their defensive backs to
even more trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been better rushing the quarterback when we've brought
linebackers and safeties this season,'' 49ers head coach Steve
Mariucci said. ``We have good pass rushers. We just haven't gotten
to the quarterback enough. We have to be able to get to the passer
with our front four. We just have to get better at it.''
</P>
<P>
   The real question, however, is whether the 49ers really can get
better in this area. After star defensive tackle Bryant Young and
his underrated sidekick, Junior Bryant, there isn't much positive
to say about the line play.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Charles Haley came out of retirement to give the
team an experienced pass rusher but at age 35, he's not likely to
improve as the season wears on. As for the other end, Gabe Wilkins,
he never was known for his pass-rushing ability. That leaves
pass-rush specialist James Posey, a 240- pound end who was nearly
knocked through the Metrodome turf on one passing play.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers realize their pass-rushing troubles won't change
quickly. The trading deadline passed last week without a trade for
Tampa Bay defensive end Regan Upshaw working out. There are no
hidden gems waiting to sign free-agent contracts. What you see is
what you get with this defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   And what the 49ers have gotten so far hasn't been anything close
to what they had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have an answer for it,'' Wilkins said. ``You see what
we do. You see that we're trying. But if I could answer those
questions as to why we aren't doing a better job, there wouldn't be
any reason to ask them.''

GORE DIALECT VS. BUSH METAPHOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Oct. 31)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Vice President Al Gore today continued his efforts to put a
new face on his presidential campaign,'' wrote Katherine Q. (for
Quimby) Seelye of The New York Times from Nashville, Tenn., ``...
promising supporters a rip-tootin' candidacy.'' His actual words
were ``a rip-tootin' campaign that is going to win in the year
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   I was not the only student of language who noticed that odd
locution. Michael Kelly, next editor of The Atlantic Monthly, wrote
in his column, ``He has moved his campaign headquarters from, as he
says, K Street to Main Street, the better to run what he, God help
us, called `a  &UR; rip-tootin &LR; '' race.''
</P>
<P>
   This term may have an Australian origin. In a review of
Genevieve Lemon's one-woman show in Sydney, Pamela Payne of The
Sydney Sun-Herald wrote in 1997, ``This first one is  &UR; rip-tootin &LR; '
great.''
</P>
<P>
   More likely, Gore took the first part of  &UR; rip-roaring &LR;  or
 &UR; rip-snorting &LR;  and married it to the last part of
 &UR; rootin'-tootin' &LR; . In linguistics, the linkage of the first part of
a compound with the second part of another compound is called a
 &UR; blend &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Rootin'-tootin' &LR;  was adopted by American slang from England's
Lancashire dialect. Nodal and Milner's 1875 glossary of the local
patois cites, ``He's a  &UR; rootin' tootin' &LR;  sort of chap.'' George
Bernard Shaw, in his 1907 play ``Neolith,'' wrote, ``The trumpet
angel ...  &UR; root-a-tooted &LR;  at the sky.'' The meaning is ``noisy,
boisterous, lively''; the OED adds  &UR; rip-roaring &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   It strikes me as onomatopoeic, imitative of a trumpet sound, and
was popularized in the United States by the 1924 song
`` &UR; Roottin-toottin &LR; -Lou From Kalamazoo.'' Since then, it has often
been applied to cowboys: Russell Hayden was known in the 1930s and
'40s as the `` &UR; rootin', tootin' &LR; , ridin' Romeo of the screen.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Rip &LR; , a verb meaning ``tear,'' is rooted in the Flemish
 &UR; rippen &LR; , ``to strip off roughly.'' In dialect, it is a combining
form for expressions like  &UR; rip-stave, rip-snort &LR;  and the airheaded
television presenter's  &UR; rip-'n'-read &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   When not meaning ``tear,'' notes Joan Houston Hall of the
Dictionary of American Regional English, `` &UR; rip &LR;  can mean `to let
out a wild yell or expletive' and in these combinations usually has
to do with noise.'' It also means ``to start noisily, frantically
or suddenly,'' as in  &UR; let 'er rip! &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Rip-roaring &LR; 's first citation was from ``The Kentuckian in New
York,'' by William Caruthers, in 1834: ``There was a  &UR; rip-roaring &LR; 
sight of slight o' hand and tumbling work there.'' Two years later,
the Yale Literary Magazine noted, ``What a  &UR; rip-snorting &LR;  red head
you have got!''
</P>
<P>
   Another dialectical variant presents itself: This bids fair to
be a  &UR; rootin'-roaring &LR;  campaign. And now to the metaphor used by
George W. Bush to dissociate himself from what he sees as less
compassionate conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   When Republicans in the House suggested distributing an earned
income tax credit to the ``working poor'' monthly rather than in a
yearly lump, Bush said, ``I don't think they ought to balance their
budget  &UR; on the backs of the poor &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   This talk caused much anguish in conservative ranks, along with
muttering about Clintonian centrist ``triangulation,'' because the
metaphor has a long Democratic history.
</P>
<P>
   The Weekly Standard found a May 1977 use by Sen. George
McGovern, charging that President Jimmy Carter was trying ``to
balance the budget  &UR; on the backs of the poor &LR; , the hungry and the
jobless.'' Soon after, Barney Frank, a disaffected liberal aide to
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, denounced his former boss for
``balancing the budget  &UR; on the backs of the poor &LR; .'' A decade
later, as the Democratic candidate for president, Dukakis threw the
identical charge at Vice President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest use I can find about the poor's burdened back came
from a far-left group led by Rep. Vito Marcantonio, the Committee
to Defend America by Keeping Out of War. Until June 1941, its
slogan was ``Take the burden of war  &UR; off the backs of the poor &LR; .''
(After Hitler invaded communist Russia, the rallying cry switched
overnight to ``For Victory Over Fascism.'')
</P>
<P>
   Earlier uses, I imagine, will also spring from anti-capitalist
sources, which is why it so set Republican teeth on edge. Adding
insult to rhetorical injury, Al Gore called for another increase in
the minimum wage, adjuring the Republican-controlled Congress to
``stop paying off their special-interest friends  &UR; on the backs of
the working poor &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   In his own speech, Bush had also said, ``Too often, on social
issues, my party has painted an image of America  &UR; slouching toward
Gomorrah &LR; .'' This phrase was an ironic play on a line in a 1921
poem by William Butler Yeats: ``And what rough beast, its hour come
round at last,/Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?''
</P>
<P>
   The ironist was former Judge Robert Bork, who titled his 1996
book about America's moral decline ``Slouching Towards Gomorrah.''
(In the Bible, Gomorrah and its twin city, Sodom, were destroyed
with fire and brimstone for their  &UR; rip-tootin' &LR;  iniquity. The
escaping Lot's backward-looking wife is revered by arms-control
advocates for being turned into a pillar of Salt II.)
</P>
<P>
   Responding with rhetorical zest to this blast at his work from
the Republican front-runner, Bork evoked the poorback metaphor in
The Wall Street Journal, suggesting that Bush ``gives the
impression that the  &UR; backs of the poor &LR;  would be safe in his
administration, but that he intends to reach the White House over
the dead bodies of conservatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Politicians have to be careful about figures of speech; they can
hurt themselves. The best admonition to those who would blithely
practice rope-a-trope came from the 19th-century vituperator
William Cobbett, who told a rival in political pamphleteering,
``When I see you flourishing with a metaphor, I feel as much
anxiety as I do when I see a child playing with a razor.''

PERSONAL HEALTH: LITTLE-KNOWN KILLER OF THE YOUNG AND THE SEEMINGLY
HEALTHY 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By JANE E. BRODY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   An apparently healthy, athletic 7-year-old boy named Billy dies
mysteriously in his sleep in his bedroom in Sarasota, Fla., while
his father grinds coffee in the nearby kitchen. An apparently
healthy 19-year-old woman from Minnesota, known to be a good
swimmer, dies after a near-drowning while swimming laps in a pool 4
feet deep. An apparently healthy 30-year-old Florida mother walks
to a fountain for a drink after playing soccer and drops dead.
</P>
<P>
   These three are among as many as 4,000 children and young adults
who died last year of long QT syndrome, a usually unrecognized
inherited defect in the heart's rhythm. Often, the first clue that
something is wrong with the way the heart beats is sudden cardiac
death. The heart muscle suddenly goes into fibrillation, beating so
fast and shallowly that no blood can circulate. Unless the heart is
shocked back into a normal rhythm within a few minutes, there is
little hope for survival.
</P>
<P>
   Long QT syndrome is believed to be a common cause of unexplained
sudden deaths among school athletes, as well as the probable cause
of many unexplained drownings.
</P>
<P>
   Long QT syndrome is caused by a mutation in a gene that
regulates the heart's electrical system. The mutation causes a
defect in heart muscle structures called ion channels that
predisposes the heart to lapse into a very rapid, ineffectual
rhythm called fibrillation.
</P>
<P>
   The syndrome is named for the QT segment of the
electrocardiogram, which lasts slightly longer than normal. It is
usually a hidden defect because few children and young adults have
electrocardiograms. In most cases, the mutation is inherited as an
autosomal dominant, which means the defective gene is located on a
non-sex chromosome and each child of an affected parent has a 50-50
chance of inheriting it.
</P>
<P>
   In patients with the syndrome, the heart takes longer to
recharge itself between beats. Under most circumstances, this
causes no symptoms. However, certain conditions can set off an
abnormal cardiac rhythm, resulting in fainting spells, dizziness,
palpitations, seizures or sudden death. Among the factors known to
start erratic beating of an affected heart are swimming, intense
physical exertion or being suddenly startled or frightened.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the 19-year-old swimmer and 30-year-old soccer
player, intense physical activity was the likely trigger. But Billy
was asleep when he died. His mother, Sharon Levy, suspects that the
noise of the coffee grinder may have set off his fatal cardiac
rhythm. Or perhaps he had been frightened by a bad dream.
</P>
<P>
   Early diagnosis, while a person is still well, can be
life-saving. In about 90 percent of cases, daily doses of the drugs
called beta-blockers can help to maintain a normal heart rhythm.
For others, a pacemaker can be implanted to regulate the heart's
rhythm or an automatic defibrillator can be installed that can
instantly detect and correct an erratic rhythm. The Florida woman's
sisters, for example, who also have long QT syndrome, now have
automatic defibrillators.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. G. Michael Vincent of Salt Lake City, medical director of
the Sudden Arrhythmia Death Syndromes (SADS) Foundation, recommends
that children with long QT syndrome refrain from competitive sports
and that coaches and teachers should never push such a child to
engage in an activity associated with instense physical or
emotional stimulation.
</P>
<P>
   Noncompetitive, recreational activities are usually appropriate
for people with long QT syndrome, Dr. Vincent said, but they should
stop whatever they are doing if they experience palpitations,
lightheadedness, weakness or blurry vision. Stopping the activity
can often prevent progression to more serious symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   A buddy system is advisable during activities so that someone
can be on the lookout for early symptoms. Because swimming or
entering a pool is especially dangerous for people with long QT
syndrome, they should always be accompanied by a knowledgeable
person who can rescue them if necessary. However, Vincent said, any
patient who experiences symptoms of long QT syndrome and is not
receiving treatment should avoid all physical activities and even
strong emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Unless a sophisticated genetic analysis is performed, long QT
syndrome cannot be detected after a person dies. In most cases,
however, by testing other blood relatives it is usually possible to
make a correct determination of the cause of death. Mrs. Levy said
Billy was an adopted child and the pediatric medical examiner who
performed the autopsy suspected long QT syndrome had caused his
death. This prompted Mrs. Levy to search for Billy's birth parents
because in all likelihood one of them carried the same defective
gene. His biological mother tested normal, but his father, age 20,
was found to have long QT syndrome, a diagnosis that may well save
him and any future children he may have from sudden, premature
death.
</P>
<P>
   But diagnosing long QT syndrome can be tricky. In about 10
percent of cases, the QT interval on the initial electrocardiogram
appears normal, and in another 40 percent, the QT interval is not
sufficiently prolonged to permit a clear-cut diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   For example, before the Minnesota woman died, her
electrocardiogram suggested that she had long QT syndrome, which
could have been caused by complications resulting from her
near-drowning. But suspicious physicians at the Mayo Clinic decided
to analyze a piece of her heart muscle removed at autopsy to see if
there was a defect in the gene linked to this syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   They found a mutation, then tested her relatives for the
syndrome. Her maternal grandfather, mother and an 18-year-old
sister were found to have the mutation, and the mother's
electrocardiogram also showed long QT syndrome. But the sister's
electrocardiogram appeared to be normal _ only one of eight
cardiologists judged it abnormal. However, because she carried the
defective gene, she is now receiving daily treatment with a
beta-blocker to reduce her risk of sudden death.
</P>
<P>
   The SADS Foundation emphasizes that any young person who
experiences fainting episodes or seizures should be tested for long
QT syndrome. Anyone who suffers an unexplained loss of
consciousness should have an electrocardiogram done. So should
anyone with a family history of unexplained fainting or sudden
death in young people. Because one-third of people with this
syndrome have no symptoms, it is not safe to assume that a person
without symptoms has not inherited the syndrome. A symptom-free
person with long QT syndrome is no less susceptible to sudden
death.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mayo Clinic physicians, writing in the Oct. 7 issue of
The New England Journal of Medicine, insist that reliance on an
electrocardiogram is not adequate. They pointed out that without
genetic testing, the 18-year-old sister ``would have been
considered normal and would not have been treated.'' ``She also
would not have received genetic counseling,'' the physicians
continued, ``including information about the 50 percent chance of
passing this mutation to future offspring, the risks associated
with swimming and other strenuous exertion and the list of
medications to avoid.''

   A Martian Theory Dries Up
</P>
<P>
   One of the more intriguing ideas to come out of the Viking
missions to Mars in the late 1970s was the suggestion that oceans
of water might once have existed on the planet. Some scientists
thought they saw evidence of old coastlines in photographs taken by
the spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   Now researchers studying images from the current Mars Global
Surveyor mission have challenged the ocean hypothesis. They say
that the new photographs, taken in 1998 and with a resolution 5 to
10 times as great as those of the Viking missions, show no
unambiguous signs of ancient seas.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, from Malin Space Science Systems, the company
that built and operates the camera aboard the Global Surveyor
orbiter, trained the instrument on four locations that scientists
had earlier suspected might be coastal sites.
</P>
<P>
   One spot was near Olympus Mons, the largest Martian volcano,
where a smooth plain meets more rugged uplands. Viking photographs
had shown what appeared to be a cliff of the kind that would be
formed by the surf's crashing against a shoreline, the suggestion
being that the plain was once covered by an ocean.
</P>
<P>
   But the Malin scientists, whose analysis was published in
Geophysical Research Letters, say the new photographs show that the
border between the two land forms is clearly not a wave-cut cliff,
or a cliff of any kind. And there is not a beach or dune in sight
either.
</P>
<P>
   Deeply Seeking Silicon
</P>
<P>
   Siliceous sponges used to be contenders. With their rocklike
skeletons made of microscopic spikes of silica, the sponges built
large reefs in shallow seas millions of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But over the eons, the fortunes of these marine creatures have
sunk, literally. Sponges with elaborate spikes now exist in deeper
waters only, and those in shallow water are a mere shell of their
former selves, with simpler spikes and a much less formidable
skeleton.
</P>
<P>
   A team of Spanish scientists has figured out why this has
happened. Plankton have gobbled up most of the silicon in the sea,
putting shallow-water sponges on a low-silicon diet.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, writing in the current issue of the journal
Nature, show that the production of spikes by one species of sponge
is greatly affected by the concentration of a silicon-containing
acid in the water. At low concentrations, the sponge produces one
kind of simple spike. At high concentrations, it produces four or
five kinds, and they have tiny branches and nodes that create a
more massive skeleton.
</P>
<P>
   Concentrations of the acid are low in shallow ocean waters,
where plankton use it for their own structural needs. So
shallow-water sponge species produce only the simpler spikes, and
only species that have shifted to lower depths, out of the range of
plankton where silicon concentrations are higher, still produce the
elaborate skeletons of long ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sizing Up a Hurricane
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane researchers have become adept at forecasting the path
a storm will take. Less well developed is the ability to predict
how intense a hurricane will be.
</P>
<P>
   For help, researchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration and the University of Colorado are turning to what
seems an unlikely instrument: the altimeter. They are using
microwave altimeters on two satellites to help determine the
location and size of eddies and currents of warmer water that can
strengthen a storm.
</P>
<P>
   The instruments help researchers determine the height of the sea
surface. Since higher sea levels are associated with warm-water
conditions, the researchers can use the data to extrapolate sea
surface temperatures and to determine the depth of warm water
zones. Combined with more direct readings of surface temperatures,
the information gives scientists a good idea of the heat potential
of specific parts of the ocean, and of how much energy the warm
water will impart to a storm as it sweeps over it.

ANIMAL ALLERGIES

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. You hear all the time about people who are allergic to cats
and dogs. Do cats and dogs ever develop allergies?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, allergies are common in cats and dogs. They arise by
similar mechanisms and can cause similar symptoms, though skin
eruptions are more common in cats and dogs than sneezing or
digestive distress. Treatments may be similar, too.
</P>
<P>
   In an allergy, the animal's immune system is hypersensitive to
some substances it encounters, called allergens. For example, it is
very common for pets to be hypersensitive to certain proteins in
the saliva of fleas.
</P>
<P>
   Pets, like people, can be allergic to substances that are
air-borne and inhaled, like pollen, mold and dust; to substances
that they come into contact with, like wool or flea collars, and to
foods, like corn, wheat, soy, beef or dairy products. The allergic
tendency can be inherited or develop after repeated exposure.
</P>
<P>
   It would be very unlikely for a cat to become allergic to its
owner, since humans do not ordinarily lick themselves clean the way
cats do, spreading some allergy-causing protein in their saliva
onto fur and dander that is then blown about in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Treating a pet's allergy may involve protecting the animal from
re-exposure to the allergen, desensitization therapy, shampoos and
rinses to remove an irritant from the skin and the use of
antihistamines and steroids.

`INSIDE' STRAIGHT: AL PACINO ENTERS THE TOBACCO WARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly
package of five intriguing features with color art.) 
 (Includes a color slide of Al Pacino in a scene from ``The
Insider.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Al Pacino had an idea.
 &HT;    At the end of his new film ``The Insider,'' an indictment of the
tobacco industry, he thought there was a chance for one final
touch.
 &HT;    ``So I went up to Michael Mann, our director, and said, `Look,
this might be really great,''' Pacino recalls. ```What if, at the
end, I light up a cigarette?'
 &HT;    ``We actually shot the scene,'' he adds, ``but it got cut. I
guess that took away from the film's true impact.''
 &HT;    And the notoriously intense actor actually chuckles.
 &HT;    Believe it or not, says Russell Crowe, who co-stars in ``The
Insider,'' which will open on Nov. 5, it's not unusual for Pacino
to inject a note of levity.
 &HT;    ``I was very surprised by Al on the set of this movie,'' Crowe
says. ``Al is really comfortable with himself. He's always at ease,
which did not fit in with the fan's perspective I have of him.
 &HT;    ``You always hear about how Al is intense,'' he adds. ``It's
just not true. I see him as relaxed _ unless he's watching a
baseball game on TV. Then he does get a bit intense.''
 &HT;    Arriving for an interview on a cool fall day in Los Angeles, the
59-year-old Pacino doesn't look intense. Handsome and casual in a
black-leather jacket, black sweatshirt and dark, tailored slacks,
he has his short, black hair spiked to stand up at the ends. He
also sports a tiny goatee, which he rubs from time to time like a
good-luck charm.
 &HT;    He can use it _ ``The Insider'' is one of the most controversial
movies of the year, not so much for its attacks not on the tobacco
industry as for its assault on one of journalism's sacred cows, the
venerated television-news program ``60 Minutes.''
 &HT;    In 1995, ``60 Minutes'' star Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer)
recorded an explosive interview with Jeffrey Wigand (Crowe), a
scientist and former executive with Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco
Corp. Wigand alleged that B&AMP;W CEO Thomas E. Sandefur had
deliberately lied under oath when he testified during Congressional
hearings that cigarettes were not addictive.
 &HT;    Pacino plays former ``60 Minutes'' producer Lowell Bergman, who
had talked Wigand into telling his story. At the last minute,
however, CBS lawyers and executives cut Wigand out of the piece,
citing fears of a lawsuit by the tobacco company.
 &HT;    Most observers see the episode as perhaps the biggest blunder of
Wallace's long career, essentially a sellout under corporate
pressure. Wallace is irate about the film, and Pacino knows it.
 &HT;    ``Look, if any one of us had a segment of our lives made into a
movie, we would be a little upset, too,'' the actor says. ``I think
the problem is, he is so close to what happened that he's worried
about how it will be portrayed.
 &HT;    ``So his reaction is natural. But I wonder what his reaction
will be after he sees the picture.''
 &HT;    When Pacino was offered the film, it immediately reminded him of
one of his greatest previous roles, the title role in ``Serpico''
(1973).
 &HT;    ``In a strange way, I started thinking about `Serpico' again,''
Pacino says. ``It's about a man trying to do the right thing
against great odds.''
 &HT;    As he did with New York Police Department whistleblower Frank
Serpico, Pacino spent time with the real Bergman to develop his
interpretation of the character.
 &HT;    ``Maybe this film was easier because I was playing a real
person,'' he says. ``I do think it's easier to play someone who
exists _ it's like having a model for your painting.''
 &HT;    Bergman is an intense person, Pacino says, but also quiet and
unobtrusive.
 &HT;    ``He's not overt,'' the actor says. ``Here's an example: I saw
Lowell the other night for the first time in a year. I almost
walked right by him. Like any good journalist, he has a way of
blending in _ he disappears into a crowd.''
 &HT;    Pacino has never been that kind of guy. Born Alfredo Pacino in
New York, he's been a performer since he was 4, entertaining his
grandfather on the roof of his apartment building. After studying
acting at New York's prestigious HB Studios _ he'd previously
dropped out of Manhattan's High School of the Performing Arts _ he
made his movie debut in ``Me, Natalie'' (1969).
 &HT;    Francis Ford Coppola saw him playing a junkie in ``The Panic in
Needle Park'' (1971) and immediately cast him as Michael Corleone
in ``The Godfather'' (1972), for which he was nominated for an
Academy Award as Best Supporting Actor.
 &HT;    The rest is movie history, including Oscar nominations for ``The
Godfather Part II'' (1974), ``Serpico,'' ``Dog Day Afternoon''
(1975), `` ... And Justice for All'' (1979), ``Dick Tracy'' (1990)
and ``Glengarry Glen Ross'' (1992). He finally won in 1992, taking
home the Best Actor award for his performance as Lt. Col. Frank
Slade in ``Scent of a Woman.''
 &HT;    Lately Pacino also has been directing, including his
Shakespearean quasidocumentary, ``Looking for Richard'' (1996), and
the recently completed ``Chinese Coffee,'' a drama in which he
doubles as director and star.
 &HT;    ``I think it's a possibility that I will direct more in the
future,'' he says. ``But I'm not sure I'm comfortable thinking of
myself as a director, because I don't have a great, overwhelming
desire to do it.
 &HT;    ``I guess there are a lot of directors who make movies without
that passion,'' he says, smiling. ``But they have a great gift _ I
never saw myself as having that gift.''
 &HT;    On the other hand, he says that acting is still a source of
elemental satisfaction to him.
 &HT;    ``Honestly, there are still moments, even after all of these
years, when I forget that the camera is even there,'' Pacino says.
``I'm just being this other person.''
 &HT;    Finding other people to be is harder, however, especially for an
actor who relishes films that have something to say about
contemporary society.
 &HT;    ``I guess times have changed, which is understandable,'' he
says. ``There are so many outlets for the news these days that
people don't want to make movies about the issues.''
 &HT;    Partly as a result of that change, the actor has been spending
more time on stage in recent years, including a recent production
of Eugene O'Neill's ``Hughie,'' for which he served as director and
star in New York and Los Angeles.
 &HT;    ``I like to return to the stage because that's where it all
started _ I'm familiar with it,'' Pacino says. ``I also enjoy the
idea of performing live, because your entire life is about that 8
p.m. curtain. When you don't have a steady diet of that type of
adrenaline in your life, you almost physically miss it.
 &HT;    ``Of course, when I'm doing a play I think, `I don't want this
adrenaline _ I don't want this tightrope,''' Pacino admits. ``But
once that curtain opens and I say the first line, there is no
turning back. And I love it.''

A MATTER OF STILLNESS: DENZEL WASHINGTON AND `THE BONE COLLECTOR' 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of Denzel Washington with Queen Latifah in
a scene from ``The Bone Collector.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Denzel Washington issues a challenge.
 &HT;    Looking at a group of journalists assembled in a suite at New
York's Regency Hotel to hear him talk about his new movie, ``The
Bone Collector,'' the actor lays out the terms.
 &HT;    ``While I'm in the room, try to sit still, without moving at
all,'' he says. ``See if you can do it.''
 &HT;    Washington looks steadily at one nervous writer, who after a few
seconds flinches. A killer smile flashes across the actor's face.
 &HT;    ``Too late!'' he says triumphantly. ``You moved.''
 &HT;    It's just his way of conveying something of the experience of
making ``The Bone Collector,'' a serial-killer thriller which opens
Nov. 5. In it, he plays Lincoln Rhyme, an ex-cop and ace forensics
specialist left a quadriplegic after an accident.
 &HT;    When a rookie officer (Angelina Jolie) stumbles across the
handiwork of a brilliant serial killer, Rhyme rediscovers his
passion for life and the thrill of the chase, relying on her to
serve as his eyes, ears and feet.
 &HT;    Washington's role required him to spend as much as 15 hours a
day, from one to three hours at a time, immobile in a bed.
 &HT;    ``There are a lot more difficult things than that, but it was a
challenge,'' Washington says. ``A part like this is just one I
couldn't turn down.''
 &HT;    Researching the role, Washington met with real-life
quadriplegics _ people able to move neither their legs nor their
arms, as opposed to paraplegics, whose legs alone are immobilized _
to get some sense of their lives. His consultants included fellow
actor Christopher Reeve, paralyzed in a 1995 riding accident.
 &HT;    ``I spent six or seven hours with Chris and, obviously, he was
the most famous person I spent time with,'' Washington says. ``I
met a construction worker who lives on $600 a month disability, and
his sister had to take care of him.
 &HT;    ``I met another guy who was a real-estate attorney with a great
career,'' the actor adds. ``He was the most upbeat, positive guy
you'd ever want to meet. He was the first guy I met.
 &HT;    ``You don't know how to act. I said,'' Washington recalls,
adopting a tentative voice, ```How are you?'
 &HT;    ``He said, `What's the matter with you? Stop moping. Speak
up!'''
 &HT;    Eventually, the actor says, he was able to get past his initial
hesitance and uncertainty.
 &HT;    ``After a while, you go, `OK, this is a human being,''' he says.
``He has a great passion for life, as does Chris. He wants to get
up and walk, and he believes he will.''
 &HT;    Washington reports that the most common frustration in
quadriplegics' everyday existence is the loss of independence.
Someone must help them do everything, from bathing to eating or
going to the bathroom.
 &HT;    ``You never get used to it,'' the actor says, ``but you deal
with it. Most of them, at one point or another, contemplated
suicide. You go through that.''
 &HT;    What he saw moved him immensely, Washington adds _ and made him
appreciate how good he has it.
 &HT;    ``One guy flipped over a bicycle,'' he says. ``One guy tripped
and fell and banged his head. You know Chris' story. It can be a
simple thing _ we're so fragile.
 &HT;    ``But you find a way to live,'' he concludes. ``For the most
part, these guys want to live.''
 &HT;    Sometimes, he adds, his conversations with quadriplegics were
even funny.
 &HT;    ``One talked about paraplegics,'' he says. ``He said, `Oh,
they're fakers, taking all the parking spaces.'
 &HT;    ``So it's all relative.''
 &HT;    Obviously, since his role kept Washington immobile, the casting
of Jolie was a crucial decision in making the movie work. She had
to be credible as a police officer, as Rhyme's student and,
ultimately, as his love interest.
 &HT;    Washington had never heard of Jolie when producer Martin Bregman
and director Phillip Noyce telephone to say ``We've got the girl!''
The actor, who has contractual approval of his co-stars, watched
Jolie's star-making turn in HBO's ``Gia'' and quickly agreed.
 &HT;    ``Thank goodness they got an actress with chops, because I'm
just sitting there,'' Washington says. ``Angelina has a lot going
on. She's fun to watch _ and not bad to look at, either.
 &HT;    ``And the sex is a real big part of all these guys' lives,'' he
adds. ``I thought their sexual lives were over. They're like, `Oh
no, Denzel.'
 &HT;    ``One guy told me, `You learn to give.' And women like that.
You're more creative.''
 &HT;    Viewers shouldn't worry that they're heading into a
movie-of-the-week. ``The Bone Collector'' is a thriller, Washington
emphasizes, and it delivers the goods. The movie isn't about a
quadriplegic, but about a detective who happens to be paralyzed.
 &HT;    ``None of it was to educate people,'' he says. ``There was no
mission statement. This is just the guy's situation.
 &HT;    ``It's not a `how-to-be-a-quadriplegic' film,'' he adds firmly.
``It's a film about a murderer. The last thing anybody needs to see
is me or anybody feeling sorry for them.''
 &HT;    His next film, ``The Hurricane,'' lets Washington make up for
his extended bed rest with a vengeance. Directed by Norman Jewison
_ who steered Washington in his breakthrough film, ``A Soldier's
Story'' (1984) _ it casts him as Rubin ``Hurricane'' Carter, a
real-life boxer who spent 20 years in prison for a murder he didn't
commit.
 &HT;    The film, which will open on Dec. 29, is being touted as an
Oscar contender that might land Washington a Best Actor statuette
to go beside the Best Supporting Actor award he won for ``Glory''
(1989).
 &HT;    ``It's a good movie,'' Washington says confidently. ``It's a
very, very good movie.
 &HT;    ``Actually, I was training for it while we were filming `Bone
Collector,''' he adds. ``That was great, because at the end of the
day, boy, I wanted to get out of that bed, throw punches and run
around.''
 &HT;    In a way, he says, the roles are similar.
 &HT;    ``One guy was stuck in his body and the other was stuck in his
cell,'' the actor says. ``They're both locked up.''
 &HT;    As turn-of-the-millennium movie stars go, Washington is a bit of
a throwback _ he's more interested in acting challenges than in the
kind of modern, high-concept action flicks that his friend and
colleague, Wesley Snipes, specializes in.
 &HT;    ``I tried that,'' Washington says with a laugh. ``I'm not good
at running and jumping. I did a couple of those films, like
`Ricochet' (1991). It's just not my thing.
 &HT;    ``Wesley loves it,'' he adds with a chuckle. ``He likes to fight
and jump and run, and that's great. He loves beating folks up.
 &HT;    ``I'm a talker. I like to talk.''

ONE IN A `MILLIONAIRE': REGIS PHILBIN BRINGS PRIME-TIME GAME SHOWS
BACK FROM THE DEAD

 (Includes a color slide of Regis Philbin in a scene from ``Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire.'') 
 By SIMON HOUPT  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 Not to be released in Canada until November 2, 1999. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, it's a miracle
Regis Philbin's head still fits on a television screen.
</P>
<P>
   Since Philbin helped take ABC's game show ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' to the top of the ratings during a two-week stretch
in August, it seems every television producer in Hollywood is
racing to get a new or revived game show into prime time.
</P>
<P>
   Classics such as ``What's My Line,'' ``The $64,000 Question''
and even the notorious, scandal-plagued 1950s game ``Twenty-One''
are retooling to get back onto the airwaves. Next summer CBS will
send 16 people to a remote island to compete for $1 million in a
Robinson Crusoe-inspired adventure/game show called ``Survivor.''
And as ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' returns for a two-week
stretch on Nov. 7, it will be shadowed by a new game on Fox _ with
a potential $2 million payoff _ called, appropriately enough,
``Greed.''
</P>
<P>
   The game-show format, as old as television itself, is red hot
again _ and it's all because of ``Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Actor Orson Bean, who was a panelist on a half-dozen shows
through the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, calls watching ``Millionaire''
this past summer his ``guilty pleasure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it because everybody else in America is watching,''
Bean says. ``It's an event.''
</P>
<P>
   Philbin seconds the motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The television audience today is so fragmented,'' he says.
``You can't sit down together as a family and watch anything
anymore _ there's nothing that everybody is interested in. But with
this show, families are coming together again to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Philbin says he knew the show would be a hit and, even though he
had turned down previous offers to host other game shows, he begged
executive producer Michael Davies for the opportunity to do
``Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had enjoyed game shows over the years, like `What's My
Line?' and `Who Do You Trust,''' Philbin says, ``but they had been
done.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, my gosh, this one is all dressed up for the next
millennium,'' he says. ``It feels like it takes place in a rocket
ship. It's got lights flashing around, it's got that music, it's
got all the things that a game show today should have _ including a
million dollars, which is still a tremendous sum of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, as ``Millionaire'' geared up for its initial
13-episode run last summer, its success was far from a slam dunk.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the original version of the show had been an enormous
success in Britain in September 1998, but ABC's own research
department found that American viewers had very little interest in
game shows. The producers didn't even have a pilot to help sell
``Millionaire'' to the network.
</P>
<P>
   But in a summer choking on reruns, with ABC consistently placing
third among viewers, the network badly needed something to
jumpstart its ratings. Besides, it had nothing to lose _ desperate
times breed desperate measures.
</P>
<P>
   If you missed ``Millionaire'' the first time around, don't worry
_ the format is deceptively simple. A contestant sits in a
so-called ``Hot Seat'' as Philbin asks a series of multiple-choice
questions.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the questions are laughably easy: ``P.T. Barnum said
there was one of these born every minute. Answer: a) a person, b) a
sucker, c) a loser or d) an Osmond.''
</P>
<P>
   With each right answer the prize money increases, as does the
level of difficulty. But every time you answer a question, you risk
losing the money you have accumulated.
</P>
<P>
   If you need some help, you can turn to three so-called
``Lifelines'': You may phone a friend for help, poll the audience
for their opinion or reduce the four multiple-choice answers down
to two.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters even easier, you get to see the question before
deciding whether to continue playing or quit, with all your
earnings intact. If all goes well, after 14 correct answers you're
facing the $1 million question.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a piece of cake, right? Think again: Only two
contestants have won $500,000, and neither took a shot at the $1
million prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy sitting there in the Hot Seat with all that
money on the line,'' says contestant Doug Van Gundy, who was the
first to win $250,000. ``At one point, I felt like I was going to
pass out _ I was so overwhelmed I just forgot to breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy became something of a local celebrity in his native
West Virginia after he greeted his win by thrusting his arms in the
air and weeping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people like the idea that some average schmo like me
can walk in off the street, armed only with the everyday detritus
of information you take in, and can turn around and win a big chunk
of money,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``In America, we're so interested in the achievements of the
individual,'' Van Gundy adds. ``The focus here is on one person.
You don't see that in any other game show.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of other game shows, producer Davies doesn't seem too
worried about the upcoming competition from ``Greed'' and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were many other sitcoms that came out after `Friends'
that were `Friends'-style,'' he says, ``and most of them didn't
work.''

 Includes a color slide of Charlton Heston in the chariot-race scene
from ``Ben-Hur.'' 
 By TOM SOTER  
 c.1999 Diversion magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Q: What 119-year-old novel by an obscure Civil War general
became one of the greatest religious screen epics of all time?
 &HT;    A: Well, here's a hint: The movie version features a
breathtaking, nine-minute chariot race with Academy Award-winner
Charlton Heston driving his own team of stallions.
 &HT;    The answer, of course, is ``Ben-Hur'' (1959), a 222-minute film
that, even as it turns 40 this November, remains an epic among
epics. And of course there's that immortal chariot race which, even
in today's era of computerized special effects, looks remarkably as
if it actually happened _ which, in fact, it did.
 &HT;    ``Ben-Hur'' took years of planning and more than a year of
filming, and cost a then-unheard-of $16 million. It was a huge
gamble that paid off richly for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, breaking
box-office records, grossing nearly $80 million worldwide, saving
the financially ailing studio and winning 11 Academy Awards, a
record matched only once, by another epic, ``Titanic'' (1997).
 &HT;    It also triggered a tidal wave of biblical epics. ``The Robe''
(1953) and ``The Ten Commandments'' (1958) had been popular, but
after ``Ben-Hur'' the floodgates opened: ``King of Kings'' (1961)
and ``Barabbas'' (1961) were followed by ``Sodom and Gomorrah''
(1963), ``The Fall of the Roman Empire'' (1964), ``The Greatest
Story Ever Told'' (1965) and, of course, ``The Bible'' (1966).
 &HT;    Set primarily in A.D. 33, the movie centers on a Jewish prince,
Judah Ben-Hur (Heston), and his boyhood friend, a Roman soldier
named Messala (Stephen Boyd), who feud over the Romans' treatment
of the Jews and eventually fight to the death in that sensational
chariot race.
 &HT;    Like many epics, Judah's saga is episodic. He is convicted of a
crime he didn't commit, and on his way to punishment meets Jesus.
He then spends three years as a galley slave, fights in a mighty
sea battle, becomes a Roman citizen and a famous charioteer,
defeats Messala, rescues his family from a leper colony and
witnesses the events leading up to Jesus' crucifixion.
 &HT;    The original novel was written by Lew Wallace, a Civil War
general, diplomat and governor of New Mexico who spent eight years
writing what he subtitled ``A Tale of the Christ.''
 &HT;    Novelist and co-screenwriter Gore Vidal has observed, however,
that it was not really a tale of the Christ at all.
 &HT;    ``It was,'' he says, ``the tale of a Roman boy and a Jewish
boy.''
 &HT;    The massive novel eventually became a best-seller, reportedly
selling 50,000 copies a year, and became a stage play in 1899 and a
silent movie in 1907 and again in 1925.
 &HT;    The 1925 ``Ben-Hur,'' starring Ramon Novarro, was a huge success
for MGM, so much so that when the financially struggling studio
needed a savior in the mid-1950s, it looked no further than
Wallace's novel.
 &HT;    This time around, MGM rented Cinecitta Studios in Rome.
 &HT;    ``It looked very much like an American studio,'' Heston writes
in his autobiography, ``which is not surprising _ Mussolini had
sent his son to Hollywood to get an idea of what a studio should be
when he'd planned it in the '30s.''
 &HT;    To direct, MGM chose William Wyler _ a two-time Oscar-winner but
still an unlikely choice, since he was best known for
character-based dramas such as ``These Three'' (1936), ``Jezebel''
(1938), ``Wuthering Heights'' (1939) and ``The Best Years of Our
Lives'' (1946).
 &HT;    Nonetheless, producer Sam Zimbalist _ who would die of a heart
attack before the film was completed _ was aiming for a thinking
man's action story, and thought Wyler would bring the right touch.
 &HT;    Wyler _ who once quipped, ``It takes a Jew to make a really good
movie about Christ'' _ picked his Ben-Hur from the cast of his
previous film, ``The Big Country'' (1958), selecting Heston over
possible alternatives including Marlon Brando, Burt Lancaster, Rock
Hudson and Kirk Douglas.
 &HT;    Heston was no stranger to epics, having starred as Moses in
``The Ten Commandments.'' But he saw Judah as a more believable,
complex individual, reflected in Karl Tunberg's script, later
heavily rewritten by Vidal and then by British playwright
Christopher Fry.
 &HT;    ``His changes were seldom structural,'' Heston recalls of Fry in
his memoirs, ``but almost always stylistically crucial, such as
changing `You didn't like the food?' to `The meal did not please
you?' ... Every scene he touched was the better for it.''
 &HT;    Vidal claims to have included a key subtextual ingredient to
help explain Messala's burning hatred for Judah _ a latent romantic
interest between the two men.
 &HT;    ``There is something emotional between these two, which is not
stated and which blows the fuse in Messala,'' the writer told
Herman. ``He is spurned, so it's a love scene gone wrong.''
 &HT;    The chariot race, which cost $1 million and took five weeks to
shoot over a three-month period, was actually choreographed by
second-unit director Andrew Marton and stunt coordinator Yakima
Canutt.
 &HT;    Marton used doubles to shoot the race in long shots, then asked
Heston and Boyd to re-create many of the sequences in closeup. For
more than a month, Heston spent at least two hours a day learning
how to drive a chariot.
 &HT;    The most daring stunt was unplanned: As Judah's chariot leaped
over the wreckage of another one, an unexpected bounce flipped
stunt driver Joe Canutt into the air and onto the rigging between
the horses.
 &HT;    ``I thought he was a dead man,'' Heston recalls. ``The chariot
weighed half a ton, with steel-rimmed wheels sure to cut him in
half, or at least cripple him ... He dropped the reins, grabbed the
front of the chariot, turned and dropped to a handstand on the
tongue behind the running team, then flung himself clear.''
 &HT;    A closeup shot was later filmed, showing Heston climbing back
into the moving chariot.
 &HT;    The race wasn't the only arduous part of the shoot. The company
worked six days a week, with Wyler logging as much as 14 hours
daily. Heston did 16 takes of one line _ ``I'm a Jew'' _ before he
could satisfy the demanding director, and also spent days rowing in
a galley, leading him to quip, ``I want to get back home, but I'm
damned if I thought I'd be rowing all the way.''
 &HT;    Actor Jack Hawkins, playing a Roman, was equally exhausted.
 &HT;    ``When we were working under the boiling Italian sun and the
temperature was in the 90s, I had to wear almost 50 pounds of
armor,'' he recalls. ``How those sailors of ancient Rome ever stood
up, much less fought a battle, I'll never know.''
 &HT;    The arena for the chariot race was the largest ever built for a
Hollywood film, stretching across 18 back-lot acres. There were
1,500-foot straightaways and a 10-foot-high central island with
four giant statues, each 30 feet high. It used 1,000,000 pounds of
plaster, 40,000 cubic feet of lumber, 260 miles of metal tubing and
40,000 tons of white sand. A track of identical size was built next
door for training the horses.
 &HT;    For all the spectacle, however, ``Ben-Hur'' ultimately succeeded
because of its message. Unlike such campy epics as ``The Ten
Commandments'' or ``The Robe,'' the film's religious and historic
events are merely a framework for its theme _ the danger of
becoming what you hate.
 &HT;    Its hero is not a plaster saint but a flawed, obsessed man. At
the end of the movie, after Messala is fatally injured, Judah
realizes what hate has done to both of them, and he seeks out
Jesus, who represents love, and asks for forgiveness.
 &HT;    ``Forgiveness is greater, and love is more powerful, than
hatred,'' one character warns. And, whatever the age and whatever
the audience, that message is universal.
 &HT;    Of course, it also helps that Judah drives one mean chariot.

`INSIDE' STRAIGHT: AL PACINO ENTERS THE TOBACCO WARS 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of Al Pacino in a scene from ``The
Insider.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Al Pacino had an idea.
 &HT;    At the end of his new film ``The Insider,'' an indictment of the
tobacco industry, he thought there was a chance for one final
touch.
 &HT;    ``So I went up to Michael Mann, our director, and said, `Look,
this might be really great,''' Pacino recalls. ```What if, at the
end, I light up a cigarette?'
 &HT;    ``We actually shot the scene,'' he adds, ``but it got cut. I
guess that took away from the film's true impact.''
 &HT;    And the notoriously intense actor actually chuckles.
 &HT;    Believe it or not, says Russell Crowe, who co-stars in ``The
Insider,'' which will open on Nov. 5, it's not unusual for Pacino
to inject a note of levity.
 &HT;    ``I was very surprised by Al on the set of this movie,'' Crowe
says. ``Al is really comfortable with himself. He's always at ease,
which did not fit in with the fan's perspective I have of him.
 &HT;    ``You always hear about how Al is intense,'' he adds. ``It's
just not true. I see him as relaxed _ unless he's watching a
baseball game on TV. Then he does get a bit intense.''
 &HT;    Arriving for an interview on a cool fall day in Los Angeles, the
59-year-old Pacino doesn't look intense. Handsome and casual in a
black-leather jacket, black sweatshirt and dark, tailored slacks,
he has his short, black hair spiked to stand up at the ends. He
also sports a tiny goatee, which he rubs from time to time like a
good-luck charm.
 &HT;    He can use it _ ``The Insider'' is one of the most controversial
movies of the year, not so much for its attacks not on the tobacco
industry as for its assault on one of journalism's sacred cows, the
venerated television-news program ``60 Minutes.''
 &HT;    In 1995, ``60 Minutes'' star Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer)
recorded an explosive interview with Jeffrey Wigand (Crowe), a
scientist and former executive with Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco
Corp. Wigand alleged that B&AMP;W CEO Thomas E. Sandefur had
deliberately lied under oath when he testified during Congressional
hearings that cigarettes were not addictive.
 &HT;    Pacino plays former ``60 Minutes'' producer Lowell Bergman, who
had talked Wigand into telling his story. At the last minute,
however, CBS lawyers and executives cut Wigand out of the piece,
citing fears of a lawsuit by the tobacco company.
 &HT;    Most observers see the episode as perhaps the biggest blunder of
Wallace's long career, essentially a sellout under corporate
pressure. Wallace is irate about the film, and Pacino knows it.
 &HT;    ``Look, if any one of us had a segment of our lives made into a
movie, we would be a little upset, too,'' the actor says. ``I think
the problem is, he is so close to what happened that he's worried
about how it will be portrayed.
 &HT;    ``So his reaction is natural. But I wonder what his reaction
will be after he sees the picture.''
 &HT;    When Pacino was offered the film, it immediately reminded him of
one of his greatest previous roles, the title role in ``Serpico''
(1973).
 &HT;    ``In a strange way, I started thinking about `Serpico' again,''
Pacino says. ``It's about a man trying to do the right thing
against great odds.''
 &HT;    As he did with New York Police Department whistleblower Frank
Serpico, Pacino spent time with the real Bergman to develop his
interpretation of the character.
 &HT;    ``Maybe this film was easier because I was playing a real
person,'' he says. ``I do think it's easier to play someone who
exists _ it's like having a model for your painting.''
 &HT;    Bergman is an intense person, Pacino says, but also quiet and
unobtrusive.
 &HT;    ``He's not overt,'' the actor says. ``Here's an example: I saw
Lowell the other night for the first time in a year. I almost
walked right by him. Like any good journalist, he has a way of
blending in _ he disappears into a crowd.''
 &HT;    Pacino has never been that kind of guy. Born Alfredo Pacino in
New York, he's been a performer since he was 4, entertaining his
grandfather on the roof of his apartment building. After studying
acting at New York's prestigious HB Studios _ he'd previously
dropped out of Manhattan's High School of the Performing Arts _ he
made his movie debut in ``Me, Natalie'' (1969).
 &HT;    Francis Ford Coppola saw him playing a junkie in ``The Panic in
Needle Park'' (1971) and immediately cast him as Michael Corleone
in ``The Godfather'' (1972), for which he was nominated for an
Academy Award as Best Supporting Actor.
 &HT;    The rest is movie history, including Oscar nominations for ``The
Godfather Part II'' (1974), ``Serpico,'' ``Dog Day Afternoon''
(1975), `` ... And Justice for All'' (1979), ``Dick Tracy'' (1990)
and ``Glengarry Glen Ross'' (1992). He finally won in 1992, taking
home the Best Actor award for his performance as Lt. Col. Frank
Slade in ``Scent of a Woman.''
 &HT;    Lately Pacino also has been directing, including his
Shakespearean quasidocumentary, ``Looking for Richard'' (1996), and
the recently completed ``Chinese Coffee,'' a drama in which he
doubles as director and star.
 &HT;    ``I think it's a possibility that I will direct more in the
future,'' he says. ``But I'm not sure I'm comfortable thinking of
myself as a director, because I don't have a great, overwhelming
desire to do it.
 &HT;    ``I guess there are a lot of directors who make movies without
that passion,'' he says, smiling. ``But they have a great gift _ I
never saw myself as having that gift.''
 &HT;    On the other hand, he says that acting is still a source of
elemental satisfaction to him.
 &HT;    ``Honestly, there are still moments, even after all of these
years, when I forget that the camera is even there,'' Pacino says.
``I'm just being this other person.''
 &HT;    Finding other people to be is harder, however, especially for an
actor who relishes films that have something to say about
contemporary society.
 &HT;    ``I guess times have changed, which is understandable,'' he
says. ``There are so many outlets for the news these days that
people don't want to make movies about the issues.''
 &HT;    Partly as a result of that change, the actor has been spending
more time on stage in recent years, including a recent production
of Eugene O'Neill's ``Hughie,'' for which he served as director and
star in New York and Los Angeles.
 &HT;    ``I like to return to the stage because that's where it all
started _ I'm familiar with it,'' Pacino says. ``I also enjoy the
idea of performing live, because your entire life is about that 8
p.m. curtain. When you don't have a steady diet of that type of
adrenaline in your life, you almost physically miss it.
 &HT;    ``Of course, when I'm doing a play I think, `I don't want this
adrenaline _ I don't want this tightrope,''' Pacino admits. ``But
once that curtain opens and I say the first line, there is no
turning back. And I love it.''

A MATTER OF STILLNESS: DENZEL WASHINGTON AND `THE BONE COLLECTOR' 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of Denzel Washington with Queen Latifah in
a scene from ``The Bone Collector.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Denzel Washington issues a challenge.
 &HT;    Looking at a group of journalists assembled in a suite at New
York's Regency Hotel to hear him talk about his new movie, ``The
Bone Collector,'' the actor lays out the terms.
 &HT;    ``While I'm in the room, try to sit still, without moving at
all,'' he says. ``See if you can do it.''
 &HT;    Washington looks steadily at one nervous writer, who after a few
seconds flinches. A killer smile flashes across the actor's face.
 &HT;    ``Too late!'' he says triumphantly. ``You moved.''
 &HT;    It's just his way of conveying something of the experience of
making ``The Bone Collector,'' a serial-killer thriller which opens
Nov. 5. In it, he plays Lincoln Rhyme, an ex-cop and ace forensics
specialist left a quadriplegic after an accident.
 &HT;    When a rookie officer (Angelina Jolie) stumbles across the
handiwork of a brilliant serial killer, Rhyme rediscovers his
passion for life and the thrill of the chase, relying on her to
serve as his eyes, ears and feet.
 &HT;    Washington's role required him to spend as much as 15 hours a
day, from one to three hours at a time, immobile in a bed.
 &HT;    ``There are a lot more difficult things than that, but it was a
challenge,'' Washington says. ``A part like this is just one I
couldn't turn down.''
 &HT;    Researching the role, Washington met with real-life
quadriplegics _ people able to move neither their legs nor their
arms, as opposed to paraplegics, whose legs alone are immobilized _
to get some sense of their lives. His consultants included fellow
actor Christopher Reeve, paralyzed in a 1995 riding accident.
 &HT;    ``I spent six or seven hours with Chris and, obviously, he was
the most famous person I spent time with,'' Washington says. ``I
met a construction worker who lives on $600 a month disability, and
his sister had to take care of him.
 &HT;    ``I met another guy who was a real-estate attorney with a great
career,'' the actor adds. ``He was the most upbeat, positive guy
you'd ever want to meet. He was the first guy I met.
 &HT;    ``You don't know how to act. I said,'' Washington recalls,
adopting a tentative voice, ```How are you?'
 &HT;    ``He said, `What's the matter with you? Stop moping. Speak
up!'''
 &HT;    Eventually, the actor says, he was able to get past his initial
hesitance and uncertainty.
 &HT;    ``After a while, you go, `OK, this is a human being,''' he says.
``He has a great passion for life, as does Chris. He wants to get
up and walk, and he believes he will.''
 &HT;    Washington reports that the most common frustration in
quadriplegics' everyday existence is the loss of independence.
Someone must help them do everything, from bathing to eating or
going to the bathroom.
 &HT;    ``You never get used to it,'' the actor says, ``but you deal
with it. Most of them, at one point or another, contemplated
suicide. You go through that.''
 &HT;    What he saw moved him immensely, Washington adds _ and made him
appreciate how good he has it.
 &HT;    ``One guy flipped over a bicycle,'' he says. ``One guy tripped
and fell and banged his head. You know Chris' story. It can be a
simple thing _ we're so fragile.
 &HT;    ``But you find a way to live,'' he concludes. ``For the most
part, these guys want to live.''
 &HT;    Sometimes, he adds, his conversations with quadriplegics were
even funny.
 &HT;    ``One talked about paraplegics,'' he says. ``He said, `Oh,
they're fakers, taking all the parking spaces.'
 &HT;    ``So it's all relative.''
 &HT;    Obviously, since his role kept Washington immobile, the casting
of Jolie was a crucial decision in making the movie work. She had
to be credible as a police officer, as Rhyme's student and,
ultimately, as his love interest.
 &HT;    Washington had never heard of Jolie when producer Martin Bregman
and director Phillip Noyce telephone to say ``We've got the girl!''
The actor, who has contractual approval of his co-stars, watched
Jolie's star-making turn in HBO's ``Gia'' and quickly agreed.
 &HT;    ``Thank goodness they got an actress with chops, because I'm
just sitting there,'' Washington says. ``Angelina has a lot going
on. She's fun to watch _ and not bad to look at, either.
 &HT;    ``And the sex is a real big part of all these guys' lives,'' he
adds. ``I thought their sexual lives were over. They're like, `Oh
no, Denzel.'
 &HT;    ``One guy told me, `You learn to give.' And women like that.
You're more creative.''
 &HT;    Viewers shouldn't worry that they're heading into a
movie-of-the-week. ``The Bone Collector'' is a thriller, Washington
emphasizes, and it delivers the goods. The movie isn't about a
quadriplegic, but about a detective who happens to be paralyzed.
 &HT;    ``None of it was to educate people,'' he says. ``There was no
mission statement. This is just the guy's situation.
 &HT;    ``It's not a `how-to-be-a-quadriplegic' film,'' he adds firmly.
``It's a film about a murderer. The last thing anybody needs to see
is me or anybody feeling sorry for them.''
 &HT;    His next film, ``The Hurricane,'' lets Washington make up for
his extended bed rest with a vengeance. Directed by Norman Jewison
_ who steered Washington in his breakthrough film, ``A Soldier's
Story'' (1984) _ it casts him as Rubin ``Hurricane'' Carter, a
real-life boxer who spent 20 years in prison for a murder he didn't
commit.
 &HT;    The film, which will open on Dec. 29, is being touted as an
Oscar contender that might land Washington a Best Actor statuette
to go beside the Best Supporting Actor award he won for ``Glory''
(1989).
 &HT;    ``It's a good movie,'' Washington says confidently. ``It's a
very, very good movie.
 &HT;    ``Actually, I was training for it while we were filming `Bone
Collector,''' he adds. ``That was great, because at the end of the
day, boy, I wanted to get out of that bed, throw punches and run
around.''
 &HT;    In a way, he says, the roles are similar.
 &HT;    ``One guy was stuck in his body and the other was stuck in his
cell,'' the actor says. ``They're both locked up.''
 &HT;    As turn-of-the-millennium movie stars go, Washington is a bit of
a throwback _ he's more interested in acting challenges than in the
kind of modern, high-concept action flicks that his friend and
colleague, Wesley Snipes, specializes in.
 &HT;    ``I tried that,'' Washington says with a laugh. ``I'm not good
at running and jumping. I did a couple of those films, like
`Ricochet' (1991). It's just not my thing.
 &HT;    ``Wesley loves it,'' he adds with a chuckle. ``He likes to fight
and jump and run, and that's great. He loves beating folks up.
 &HT;    ``I'm a talker. I like to talk.''

ONE IN A `MILLIONAIRE': REGIS PHILBIN BRINGS PRIME-TIME GAME SHOWS
BACK FROM THE DEAD

 (Includes a color slide of Regis Philbin in a scene from ``Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire.'') 
 By SIMON HOUPT  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 Not to be released in Canada until November 2, 1999. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, it's a miracle
Regis Philbin's head still fits on a television screen.
</P>
<P>
   Since Philbin helped take ABC's game show ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' to the top of the ratings during a two-week stretch
in August, it seems every television producer in Hollywood is
racing to get a new or revived game show into prime time.
</P>
<P>
   Classics such as ``What's My Line,'' ``The $64,000 Question''
and even the notorious, scandal-plagued 1950s game ``Twenty-One''
are retooling to get back onto the airwaves. Next summer CBS will
send 16 people to a remote island to compete for $1 million in a
Robinson Crusoe-inspired adventure/game show called ``Survivor.''
And as ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' returns for a two-week
stretch on Nov. 7, it will be shadowed by a new game on Fox _ with
a potential $2 million payoff _ called, appropriately enough,
``Greed.''
</P>
<P>
   The game-show format, as old as television itself, is red hot
again _ and it's all because of ``Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Actor Orson Bean, who was a panelist on a half-dozen shows
through the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, calls watching ``Millionaire''
this past summer his ``guilty pleasure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it because everybody else in America is watching,''
Bean says. ``It's an event.''
</P>
<P>
   Philbin seconds the motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The television audience today is so fragmented,'' he says.
``You can't sit down together as a family and watch anything
anymore _ there's nothing that everybody is interested in. But with
this show, families are coming together again to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Philbin says he knew the show would be a hit and, even though he
had turned down previous offers to host other game shows, he begged
executive producer Michael Davies for the opportunity to do
``Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had enjoyed game shows over the years, like `What's My
Line?' and `Who Do You Trust,''' Philbin says, ``but they had been
done.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, my gosh, this one is all dressed up for the next
millennium,'' he says. ``It feels like it takes place in a rocket
ship. It's got lights flashing around, it's got that music, it's
got all the things that a game show today should have _ including a
million dollars, which is still a tremendous sum of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, as ``Millionaire'' geared up for its initial
13-episode run last summer, its success was far from a slam dunk.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the original version of the show had been an enormous
success in Britain in September 1998, but ABC's own research
department found that American viewers had very little interest in
game shows. The producers didn't even have a pilot to help sell
``Millionaire'' to the network.
</P>
<P>
   But in a summer choking on reruns, with ABC consistently placing
third among viewers, the network badly needed something to
jumpstart its ratings. Besides, it had nothing to lose _ desperate
times breed desperate measures.
</P>
<P>
   If you missed ``Millionaire'' the first time around, don't worry
_ the format is deceptively simple. A contestant sits in a
so-called ``Hot Seat'' as Philbin asks a series of multiple-choice
questions.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the questions are laughably easy: ``P.T. Barnum said
there was one of these born every minute. Answer: a) a person, b) a
sucker, c) a loser or d) an Osmond.''
</P>
<P>
   With each right answer the prize money increases, as does the
level of difficulty. But every time you answer a question, you risk
losing the money you have accumulated.
</P>
<P>
   If you need some help, you can turn to three so-called
``Lifelines'': You may phone a friend for help, poll the audience
for their opinion or reduce the four multiple-choice answers down
to two.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters even easier, you get to see the question before
deciding whether to continue playing or quit, with all your
earnings intact. If all goes well, after 14 correct answers you're
facing the $1 million question.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a piece of cake, right? Think again: Only two
contestants have won $500,000, and neither took a shot at the $1
million prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy sitting there in the Hot Seat with all that
money on the line,'' says contestant Doug Van Gundy, who was the
first to win $250,000. ``At one point, I felt like I was going to
pass out _ I was so overwhelmed I just forgot to breathe.''
</P>

 Includes a color slide of Charlton Heston in the chariot-race scene
from ``Ben-Hur.'' 
 By TOM SOTER  
 c.1999 Diversion magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Q: What 119-year-old novel by an obscure Civil War general
became one of the greatest religious screen epics of all time?
 &HT;    A: Well, here's a hint: The movie version features a
breathtaking, nine-minute chariot race with Academy Award-winner
Charlton Heston driving his own team of stallions.
 &HT;    The answer, of course, is ``Ben-Hur'' (1959), a 222-minute film
that, even as it turns 40 this November, remains an epic among
epics. And of course there's that immortal chariot race which, even
in today's era of computerized special effects, looks remarkably as
if it actually happened _ which, in fact, it did.
 &HT;    ``Ben-Hur'' took years of planning and more than a year of
filming, and cost a then-unheard-of $16 million. It was a huge
gamble that paid off richly for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, breaking
box-office records, grossing nearly $80 million worldwide, saving
the financially ailing studio and winning 11 Academy Awards, a
record matched only once, by another epic, ``Titanic'' (1997).
 &HT;    It also triggered a tidal wave of biblical epics. ``The Robe''
(1953) and ``The Ten Commandments'' (1958) had been popular, but
after ``Ben-Hur'' the floodgates opened: ``King of Kings'' (1961)
and ``Barabbas'' (1961) were followed by ``Sodom and Gomorrah''
(1963), ``The Fall of the Roman Empire'' (1964), ``The Greatest
Story Ever Told'' (1965) and, of course, ``The Bible'' (1966).
 &HT;    Set primarily in A.D. 33, the movie centers on a Jewish prince,
Judah Ben-Hur (Heston), and his boyhood friend, a Roman soldier
named Messala (Stephen Boyd), who feud over the Romans' treatment
of the Jews and eventually fight to the death in that sensational
chariot race.
 &HT;    Like many epics, Judah's saga is episodic. He is convicted of a
crime he didn't commit, and on his way to punishment meets Jesus.
He then spends three years as a galley slave, fights in a mighty
sea battle, becomes a Roman citizen and a famous charioteer,
defeats Messala, rescues his family from a leper colony and
witnesses the events leading up to Jesus' crucifixion.
 &HT;    The original novel was written by Lew Wallace, a Civil War
general, diplomat and governor of New Mexico who spent eight years
writing what he subtitled ``A Tale of the Christ.''
 &HT;    Novelist and co-screenwriter Gore Vidal has observed, however,
that it was not really a tale of the Christ at all.
 &HT;    ``It was,'' he says, ``the tale of a Roman boy and a Jewish
boy.''
 &HT;    The massive novel eventually became a best-seller, reportedly
selling 50,000 copies a year, and became a stage play in 1899 and a
silent movie in 1907 and again in 1925.
 &HT;    The 1925 ``Ben-Hur,'' starring Ramon Novarro, was a huge success
for MGM, so much so that when the financially struggling studio
needed a savior in the mid-1950s, it looked no further than
Wallace's novel.
 &HT;    This time around, MGM rented Cinecitta Studios in Rome.
 &HT;    ``It looked very much like an American studio,'' Heston writes
in his autobiography, ``which is not surprising _ Mussolini had
sent his son to Hollywood to get an idea of what a studio should be
when he'd planned it in the '30s.''
 &HT;    To direct, MGM chose William Wyler _ a two-time Oscar-winner but
still an unlikely choice, since he was best known for
character-based dramas such as ``These Three'' (1936), ``Jezebel''
(1938), ``Wuthering Heights'' (1939) and ``The Best Years of Our
Lives'' (1946).
 &HT;    Nonetheless, producer Sam Zimbalist _ who would die of a heart
attack before the film was completed _ was aiming for a thinking
man's action story, and thought Wyler would bring the right touch.
 &HT;    Wyler _ who once quipped, ``It takes a Jew to make a really good
movie about Christ'' _ picked his Ben-Hur from the cast of his
previous film, ``The Big Country'' (1958), selecting Heston over
possible alternatives including Marlon Brando, Burt Lancaster, Rock
Hudson and Kirk Douglas.
 &HT;    Heston was no stranger to epics, having starred as Moses in
``The Ten Commandments.'' But he saw Judah as a more believable,
complex individual, reflected in Karl Tunberg's script, later
heavily rewritten by Vidal and then by British playwright
Christopher Fry.
 &HT;    ``His changes were seldom structural,'' Heston recalls of Fry in
his memoirs, ``but almost always stylistically crucial, such as
changing `You didn't like the food?' to `The meal did not please
you?' ... Every scene he touched was the better for it.''
 &HT;    Vidal claims to have included a key subtextual ingredient to
help explain Messala's burning hatred for Judah _ a latent romantic
interest between the two men.
 &HT;    ``There is something emotional between these two, which is not
stated and which blows the fuse in Messala,'' the writer told
Herman. ``He is spurned, so it's a love scene gone wrong.''
 &HT;    The chariot race, which cost $1 million and took five weeks to
shoot over a three-month period, was actually choreographed by
second-unit director Andrew Marton and stunt coordinator Yakima
Canutt.
 &HT;    Marton used doubles to shoot the race in long shots, then asked
Heston and Boyd to re-create many of the sequences in closeup. For
more than a month, Heston spent at least two hours a day learning
how to drive a chariot.
 &HT;    The most daring stunt was unplanned: As Judah's chariot leaped
over the wreckage of another one, an unexpected bounce flipped
stunt driver Joe Canutt into the air and onto the rigging between
the horses.
 &HT;    ``I thought he was a dead man,'' Heston recalls. ``The chariot
weighed half a ton, with steel-rimmed wheels sure to cut him in
half, or at least cripple him ... He dropped the reins, grabbed the
front of the chariot, turned and dropped to a handstand on the
tongue behind the running team, then flung himself clear.''
 &HT;    A closeup shot was later filmed, showing Heston climbing back
into the moving chariot.
 &HT;    The race wasn't the only arduous part of the shoot. The company
worked six days a week, with Wyler logging as much as 14 hours
daily. Heston did 16 takes of one line _ ``I'm a Jew'' _ before he
could satisfy the demanding director, and also spent days rowing in
a galley, leading him to quip, ``I want to get back home, but I'm
damned if I thought I'd be rowing all the way.''
 &HT;    Actor Jack Hawkins, playing a Roman, was equally exhausted.
 &HT;    ``When we were working under the boiling Italian sun and the
temperature was in the 90s, I had to wear almost 50 pounds of
armor,'' he recalls. ``How those sailors of ancient Rome ever stood
up, much less fought a battle, I'll never know.''
 &HT;    The arena for the chariot race was the largest ever built for a
Hollywood film, stretching across 18 back-lot acres. There were
1,500-foot straightaways and a 10-foot-high central island with
four giant statues, each 30 feet high. It used 1,000,000 pounds of
plaster, 40,000 cubic feet of lumber, 260 miles of metal tubing and
40,000 tons of white sand. A track of identical size was built next
door for training the horses.
 &HT;    For all the spectacle, however, ``Ben-Hur'' ultimately succeeded
because of its message. Unlike such campy epics as ``The Ten
Commandments'' or ``The Robe,'' the film's religious and historic
events are merely a framework for its theme _ the danger of
becoming what you hate.
 &HT;    Its hero is not a plaster saint but a flawed, obsessed man. At
the end of the movie, after Messala is fatally injured, Judah
realizes what hate has done to both of them, and he seeks out
Jesus, who represents love, and asks for forgiveness.
 &HT;    ``Forgiveness is greater, and love is more powerful, than
hatred,'' one character warns. And, whatever the age and whatever
the audience, that message is universal.
 &HT;    Of course, it also helps that Judah drives one mean chariot.

DISPIRITED COLLINS SHOULD BE PROUD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was left to New Hampshire's Senator Bob Smith to
get to the nub of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's beat President Clinton just one time on something,'' the
newly independent former Republican thundered on his favorite
cause, eliminating abortion rights. ``I'm sick of losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Better keep the Bromo handy, Bob.
</P>
<P>
   In this latest struggle in the abortion wars, a more mature
legislator in a struggle that was much different from previous ones
was Senator Susan Collins. During the annual fight over what has
been politically labeled ``partial-birth abortion,'' Maine's
freshman Republican was somewhat dispirited. A classic swing vote,
Collins felt lousy about seeing a ban on unlimited political cash
from special interests blocked by another filibuster earlier in the
week. And she was on the short end of a 61-38 vote on an attempt to
find common ground behind prochoice and antiabortion senators.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, she should have been greatly encouraged. Collins is a
major part of a fresh effort in the Senate that has good prospects
and three prongs. The first involves common ground initiatives; the
second is exposing both the absurdity and literal deception in the
partial-birth abortion banners' position; and the third is a fresh
assertiveness on the part of prochoicers, based on the reality of
the threat to abortion rights as set forth in Roe v. Wade. Taken in
order:
</P>
<P>
   Collins was a cosponsor last week of a proposal that would have
prohibited abortions after viability of the fetus outside the
mother's body has been established. Designed to track Roe's
guidelines, exceptions would involve saving the life of the woman
and protecting her health from ``grievous physical harm,'' defined
narrowly, and two doctors (one non-attending) would have to certify
each case. The two-doctor rule was added, to attract more support
to an earlier proposal that never got traction last year.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't ideal, and might not pass court review because of the
absence of protection for mental health, but the proposal made
senators think, as reflected in the votes of Northeasterners. Some
prochoicers voted to kill the proposal by Democrat Dick Durbin of
Illinois with the 61-38 majority: Republicans John Chaffee of Rhode
Island and Jim Jeffords of Vermont, and Democrats Jack Reed of
Rhode Island and Chuck Schumer of New York. But more supported it:
Edward Kennedy and John Kerry of Massachusetts, Collins and Maine
Republican Olympia Snowe, and Democrats Patrick Leahy of Vermont,
Christopher Dodd and Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, and Patrick
Moynihan of New York.
</P>
<P>
   But more revealing were the killing votes of New Hampshire's
antichoice twins, Smith and Judd Gregg. They opposed a proposal
that would eliminate elective abortions after viability was
determined even as they voted to support one that would not, in
prolife language, save a single baby.
</P>
<P>
   Their floor leader, Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, said his
proposal would ban only one abortion procedure and would not
prevent so much as one late-term abortion. Regardless of the
procedure, the fetus would be just as dead.
</P>
<P>
   Santorum also said prolifers would only support exceptions for
the life of the mother, leaving out those forced to deliver fetuses
(including those that might be lacking a brain or could survive for
no more than minutes) even if delivery destroys a woman's ability
to have future kids.
</P>
<P>
   And that, as Collins told me, ``raises serious questions about
the real intentions of the supporters'' of the ban.
</P>
<P>
   The real purpose is to directly undermine Roe in the guise of
legislating procedures for aborting fetuses. The actual language of
bills like Santorum's and 29 others proves it.
</P>
<P>
   The targeted procedure is described vaguely enough that experts
regularly testify that it could be read to ban other procedures. It
makes no distinctions among pregnancy trimesters. And it has no
exceptions to protect the physical or mental health of a pregnant
woman. That's why out of 30 state statutes like Santorum's, 18 of
21 legal challenges have produced quick injunctions against
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows these laws are unconstitutional on their
face,'' said Collins. But the threat to choice is real, and it's
time the threat produced political action as it did a decade ago.
That's why Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, offered a nonbinding
resolution calling the Roe decision correct and worth sustaining.
It passed, but only by a 51-48 test vote with one opponent (John
McCain) absent. And the Santorum measure gained one vote from 1997,
though it is three short of the 67 required to override a certain
Clinton veto.
</P>
<P>
   Harkin's purpose, quickly backed by Vice President Al Gore, was
to show that abortion rights hang by a thread in the current
Congress. It should be a wakeup call for prochoicers in both
parties. People like Collins have helped unmask the opposition.
They need to press on.

   SCI-BRAZIL-SKULL (Rio de Janeiro) _ A human skull that is
prominently displayed at the National Museum here has been
attracting crowds and controversy in equal measure since it was
first unveiled early this month. After two decades in storage, the
fossilized cranium has now been identified by Brazilian scientists
as the oldest human remains ever recovered in the Western
Hemisphere. The skull is that of a young woman, nicknamed Luzia,
who is believed to have roamed the savannah of south-central Brazil
some 11,500 years ago. Even more startling, a reconstruction of her
cranium undertaken in Britain this year indicates that her features
appear to be Negroid rather than Mongoloid, suggesting that the
Western Hemisphere may have initially been settled not only earlier
than thought, but by a people distinct from the ancestors of
today's North and South American Indians. By Larry Rohter.

   PATTERNS: Going Gently, Into Sleep and Old Age
</P>
<P>
   Next time you skip a few hours of sleep so you can get in a
little more work, or maybe just that last bit of Letterman,
consider the possible consequences: you may pay for the sleep
deprivation not just the next morning, but somewhere down the road
as well.
</P>
<P>
   A new study suggests that chronic lack of sleep may make the
aging process that much harder.
</P>
<P>
   The report, in The Lancet, an international medical journal,
said that over the past century, the average length of time people
slept had decreased to about seven and a half hours, down from
nine.
</P>
<P>
   This has occurred as people try to accommodate not only the
demands of shift work but broader social lives, the journal said.
</P>
<P>
   To test the physiological effects of such sleep loss,
researchers at the University of Chicago studied 11 young men over
16-day periods.
</P>
<P>
   For the first three nights, the men were allowed to sleep 8
hours; for the next six, they slept 4 hours; for the final seven
nights, they slept 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers then measured their carbohydrate metabolism and
hormone functions, and found that both had been harmed.
</P>
<P>
   The effects, they say, resemble those found in the normal aging
process _ and so may increase the severity of age-related chronic
disorders.
</P>
<P>
   RISKS AND REMEDIES: A Gene, a Threat and a Buildup of Iron
</P>
<P>
   As many as 1 in 10 people may be at increased risk of heart
attack or stroke simply because they carry a gene that can lead to
a serious metabolic disorder, even if they are in good health,
recent studies suggest.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the carriers of the gene for the disorder, known as
hemochromatosis, were not shown to be at any special health risk.
</P>
<P>
   Carriers have one copy of the mutated gene associated with the
disease, while sufferers of hemochromatosis inherit one mutated
gene from each parent.
</P>
<P>
   People with the disease absorb too much iron and often sustain
serious injury to the liver, pancreas and other organs.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce iron buildup, sufferers of the disease regularly have
blood drained from their bodies, sometimes as often as once a week.
</P>
<P>
   (The condition has received added attention recently as Federal
health officials consider whether to allow that blood to be used to
help the nation's dwindling blood supply; at the moment, it is
simply thrown away.)
</P>
<P>
   Although they have been spared the burdens of hemochromatosis,
carriers have slightly elevated levels of iron in their blood, and
some researchers have theorized that the added iron could pose a
risk of coronary disease.
</P>
<P>
   Two studies published in a recent issue of Circulation: Journal
the American Heart Association, have now found evidence to support
that theory.
</P>
<P>
   That could raise some broad health questions, including whether
the carriers _ who can get a diagnosis only with a genetic test _
should start having their blood drawn to deplete the iron buildup,
said Dr. Jerome L. Sullivan of the University of Florida at
Gainesville, who wrote an editorial accompanying the studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It suggests a new risk factor in a fairly sizable chunk of the
population,'' Sullivan said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   TREATMENTS: Untapped Potential for a Common Herb
</P>
<P>
   Anesthesiologists, like many doctors, tend to be wary of herbal
medicines. Just this year, several anesthesiology associations
began a campaign to warn people facing surgery that their doctors
needed to know if they were taking herbal remedies, since some
could have dangerous interactions with anesthesia.
</P>
<P>
   But now anesthesiologists have begun turning to an herb to help
treat a deadly and often intractable lung condition that affects
hundreds of thousands of people a year.
</P>
<P>
   The herb is borage, valued until now mainly for its slightly
cucumberish taste and its eye-pleasing purple and pink flowers. The
disease is acute respiratory distress syndrome, which can result
from trauma (like a car accident), infection and other causes, and
has a fatality rate as high as 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have turned to an arsenal of weapons to cure it, some
high tech, but have so far accomplished little. Now, researchers
from the Mayo Clinic report that in a study of 150 hospital
patients who had oil from borage seeds administered through tubes
in their stomachs, the death rate from the respiratory syndrome
dropped by about 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A second study with a smaller group of patients had similar
results, and researchers now plan further study. The findings were
presented at the recent annual meeting of the American Society of
Anesthesiologists.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers believe the benefits come from a component of the
herb called gammalinolenic acid, which has natural
anti-inflammatory qualities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excited would be an understatement,'' said Dr. Michael J.
Murray, the Mayo anesthesiologist who conducted the study, when he
was asked his reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ADOLESCENCE: On Sex, Students Have a Lot to Learn
</P>
<P>
   Despite renewed efforts across the country to educate teen-agers
about sex and repercussions like pregnancy and disease, many young
people say they still need more information. A new study of high
school students suggests that they are right.
</P>
<P>
   A nationwide survey of 1,012 public school students conducted
for the Kaiser Family Foundation, the health care philanthropy,
found these gaps in students' knowledge:
</P>
<P>
   _15 percent of those who reported being sexually active said
they did not know they could obtain condoms without their parents'
permission, and 39 percent did not know they could buy birth
control pills on their own.
</P>
<P>
   _More than half the girls asked did not know that emergency
contraceptive pills could be taken after intercourse to protect
against pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   _And nearly half those surveyed did not realize that their
chances of becoming infected with the AIDS virus through sex
increased if they had another sexually transmitted disease.
</P>
<P>
   The Kaiser foundation reported that students also said they
needed more information about where to get tested for AIDS and
other diseases, how to use condoms and what to do if they or an
acquaintance had been sexually assaulted.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Hoff, an official for the foundation, said she was
surprised by the lack of knowledge, given the age of the students
questioned. She also said it appeared that girls were more willing
to own up to their ignorance than boys. ``We need to do more to
target young men, and make sure that they're getting information on
sexual health issues as well,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   SAFETY: A Halloween Scare for Parents: Traffic
</P>
<P>
   It's not the ghosts, the goblins or even all that sugar that
puts many children at risk when they go out trick or treating.
</P>
<P>
   It's the cars.
</P>
<P>
   More than 700 children are killed by cars each year, and 24,000
more are injured.
</P>
<P>
   But a study by the Federal Department of Health and Human
Services, cited by the National Safe Kids Campaign, found that from
1975 to 1996, children were four times as likely to be fatally
injured by a car on Halloween night as on any other evening.
</P>
<P>
   With hordes of Pokemons, ballerinas and assorted ghouls poised
to hit the streets on Sunday, the Safe Kids Campaign
(www.safekids.org), a nonprofit organization based in Washington,
has issued its annual tips for making the holiday safer. The group
urged parents to take these precautions:
</P>
<P>
   _Don't allow children under 12 to trick or treat without adult
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   _Decorate costumes and bags with reflective tape.
</P>
<P>
   _Teach children to walk, not run, while trick or treating, and
not to dart between parked cars.
</P>
<P>
   _And beware of costumes that can restrict a child's vision.

ARMING AN UNSUNG ARMY OF CAREGIVERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y.)   (Science Times)  
 (af)  
 By ABIGAIL ZUGER, M.D.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hospitals may not be called pest houses anymore, but they are
still terrible places to be sick. They are all crawling with
bacteria, with strangers who are sometimes kindly but sometimes
not, with the potential for bad accidents; hospitals assault the
senses from every direction, and then they send a bill.
</P>
<P>
   No, from time immemorial it has always been far better, if
possible, to be sick at home, surrounded by familiar comforts and
tended by a devoted relative or friend.
</P>
<P>
   But that part of the picture is changing fast. Those devoted
attendants have much more complicated jobs than they once did.
Medical science is saving more lives, at the price of creating more
people with serious chronic medical problems who need continuing
expert care.
</P>
<P>
   And the hospital is no longer the site of most of that care:
increasingly portable technology (not to mention rising costs)
means that the deep desire of every sick person to get out of the
hospital right this minute can generally be accommodated.
</P>
<P>
   But while the technology can easily travel home, no one has yet
figured out a way to get the hospital staff home too.
</P>
<P>
   So instead, a vast, silent volunteer army has grown up: millions
of Americans who do unpaid service as health care providers, with
many of the skills of the professionals but none of the salary, by
caring for sick relatives and friends at home.
</P>
<P>
   A study published in March in the policy journal Health Affairs
estimated this work force at 25.8 million people as of 1997, each
working an average of 18 hours a week. If they were all paid an
hourly wage commensurate with their duties _ from the unskilled
labor of changing bed linen to the highly technical work of
adjusting machines and administering medications _ their economic
value would come to $196 billion, about 18 percent of total
national health care spending for 1997 and six times the $32
billion Americans formally spent on home care that year.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators and policy makers pay attention to numbers like
these, as witnessed by the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 and
the tax credit proposal for home care givers now under
consideration in Congress. But, as virtually anybody who has ever
spent time caring for a sick person knows well, the professional
custodians of the nation's health have yet to give these millions
of new colleagues their due.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and nurses, therapists and social workers, well
intentioned though they may be, still tend to think in the old
authoritarian patterns. The patient is their patient; they are in
charge; they know best. Just leave them alone to do their work.
Please.
</P>
<P>
   What little training the professionals get in the art of
negotiating shared responsibilities is generally devoted to the
tangled politics of getting along with one another. Doctors and
nurses are still scrapping in the Hundred Years' War; few have the
insight or energy left over to negotiate the same issues with third
parties. In fact, in surveys that ask health professionals what
makes their jobs most difficult, many immediately reply,
``Families.''
</P>
<P>
   But consider this multiple-choice question (not to be found
among the millions that line the path into the caring professions):
A doctor sees a patient for 15 minutes once a month, a visiting
nurse drops in once a week, a therapist spends an hour or so every
few days, an aide comes in for the morning shift.
</P>
<P>
   A caretaking spouse, child or parent is there for the duration,
learning what the pills look like and how they go down, how to
change the bandages and what to do when the machinery at the
bedside starts beeping at 3 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Whose patient is it?
</P>
<P>
   It is small wonder that a grass-roots movement is slowly taking
shape in the ranks of these family caregivers, asking for a little
more acknowledgment from medical professionals, a little more
education and a lot more respect.
</P>
<P>
   One of their most eloquent voices has been that of Carol Levine,
a health policy researcher with the United Hospital Fund in New
York. Ms. Levine's work with children orphaned by the AIDS epidemic
earned her a MacArthur Foundation ``genius'' grant in 1993. Now she
spends most workdays on a long-term project that aims to bring
family caregivers out of the shadows into the forefront of health
policy decisions.
</P>
<P>
   At night, she joins the caregivers' ranks, tending to her
husband, Howard, 71, who was injured in an automobile accident in
1990. Once a sharp, energetic public relations executive, Levine is
bedbound and largely paralyzed, with serious brain damage.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years of hands-on caregiving have given Ms. Levine an
intimate familiarity with the rough patches of the terrain.
Unreliable ambulette service, irresponsible insurers and a new
wheelchair that is an inch too wide to fit into the dentist's
office are bad, she said in an interview. But any prolonged
interaction with doctors and hospitals is generally even worse.
</P>
<P>
   Levine has required periodic hospitalizations over the years,
and making the transfer between hospital and home is always a
nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the hospital, they think they're the experts and you're
just the family,'' she said. ``But I am an expert. I'm an expert in
(italics)him.''(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   And then, when it is time to go home, all the responsibility is
suddenly hers again. She is the effector arm of the doctors' plans,
the key to their success or failure. Even so, she is regularly sent
off with a minimum of explanation or training for any new
conditions, medications or equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Levine has to date supervised the disbursement of about $1.5
million in grant money to hospitals in the New York area for an
assortment of projects to help home caregivers do their job. But no
institution has yet taken her up on her most revolutionary
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``All professionals in training should spend a day entirely on
their own in a household like mine,'' she said. Not to make a house
call, or a home visit, she emphasized, or tolish a series of
discrete tasks, but to live the total experience _ the stretches of
boredom and the moments of sheer terror, all played out in the
complete isolation of the home.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day out of all those years of training,'' she said. ``Is
that too much to ask?''

<P>
   A new calculation suggests that dense star clusters, which are
sprinkled throughout galaxies in Earth's cosmic neighborhood, act
as assembly lines for tightly orbiting pairs of black holes and
then spit them out of the cluster. There, they eventually fall
together and merge into one.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, if all goes well, scientists will be able to take the
first steps toward testing that theory with a new $350 million
instrument called a gravity wave observatory.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, a cataclysmic merger of black holes should throw
off ripples in the fabric of space called gravity waves. It was to
detect those waves for the first time, from a variety of sources,
in particular from pairs of neutron stars, that physicists designed
the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO,
which is actually two stations, one in Louisiana and one in
Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   LIGO will be dedicated on Nov. 11 and begin shakedown operations
in January.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, astrophysicists had assumed that black hole pairs
were so rare they would be almost impossible to detect. The
scientists preparing to work at LIGO assumed that their first
capture of gravity waves would come from less powerful events in
the cosmos.
</P>
<P>
   The new calculations, by Dr. Simon F. Portegies Zwart of Boston
University and Dr. Stephen L.W. McMillan of Drexel University,
suggest that detectable mergers of black holes could be as much as
a thousand times more common than the neutron stars LIGO had set
its sights on.
</P>
<P>
   As is customary in astrophysics, the calculations have been
posted on a Web site managed by Los Alamos National Laboratory
(xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9910061). They have also been accepted
for publication at the journal Astrophysical Journal Letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge difference,'' McMillan said. ``When you start
making these things in clusters,'' he said, referring to the black
hole pairs, ``the conditions are very favorable.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Barry C. Barish, a physicist at the California Institute of
Technology, who is the director of LIGO, said that if the
calculation was correct, its implications for the observatory's
first five to six years of operation were striking.
</P>
<P>
   The LIGO detectors that will be in place during that time are
much less sensitive than those to come later, and the black hole
pairs could make the difference between seeing gravity waves or not
seeing them at all during that first phase.
</P>
<P>
   If the new calculations prove true, improvements might boost
LIGO's later detection rate from several events a year to as many
as one or two a day, said Dr. Stuart Shapiro, an astrophysicist at
the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign, who is involved in
calculating those rates. ``That's when you can do real science,''
Shapiro said.
</P>
<P>
   Gravity waves have teased physicists for decades, because they
have announced their presence only indirectly. For example, when
Dr. Joseph H. Taylor and Dr. Russell A. Hulse of Princeton observed
a pair of neutron stars caught in a tight orbit around each other,
work for which they received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1993,
they theorized that the stars should produce gravity waves.
</P>
<P>
   The whirling neutron stars, superdense cinders that sometimes
remain when an ordinary massive star collapses and explodes as a
supernova, slightly stir the four-dimensional fabric of space and
time around them.
</P>
<P>
   According to relativity theory, that stirring action should send
out a weak signal of gravity waves.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Taylor and Hulse could not measure those waves directly. All
they could do was show, with years of work, that the rotation of
the two-star, or binary, system was gradually speeding up as the
stars spiraled closer together.
</P>
<P>
   The acceleration is exactly what would be expected if the energy
was being carried away by the gravity waves.
</P>
<P>
   Even LIGO, which is being built by Caltech and the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and will measure the minute stretching and
shrinking of space caused by such disturbances, will not be capable
of picking up such a faint spray of gravity waves.
</P>
<P>
   But when two neutron stars get so close that they crash together
and merge, the resulting burst of gravity waves should be
detectable if the collision occurs within one of the thousands of
galaxies that are within about 50 million light-years of Earth.
</P>
<P>
   That process relies on ordinary stars' occasionally being born
in pairs, exploding as supernovas and leaving behind neutron stars
with masses of about 1.5 times that of the Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Black holes contain the mass of 10 or more suns and are even
more exotic, having collapsed behind a gravitational shroud called
an event horizon from which nothing can escape, not even light. The
chances that pairs of black holes could form as neutron star
binaries do is vanishingly small.
</P>
<P>
   So McMillan and Portegies Zwart looked at the possibility that
black hole pairs might, in effect, be manufactured inside the tight
knots of stars called globular clusters.
</P>
<P>
   In the clusters, which can contain millions of stars, individual
black holes fall to the middle because of their great mass, the
team realized.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, the black holes attract each other gravitationally
and pair off, forming binaries.
</P>
<P>
   The binaries then carom off other black holes and eventually
pick up enough speed to escape from the cluster. Out in the dark
wasteland of space, the black holes spiral inward just as the
neutron stars do, and finally they merge in a spectacular
collision.
</P>
<P>
   Because the black holes are more massive than neutron stars,
said Barish of LIGO, more gravity waves are emitted and the events
are easier to see from far away. ``We see something that happened
deeper into the universe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The greater range adds up to a much bigger volume of space that
LIGO can monitor, Barish said.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of the new work stress that an imperfect knowledge
of clusters and black holes means that their estimates are
uncertain by a factor of 10 or so. ``We still have no guarantees,''
said Dr. Kip S. Thorne, a LIGO collaborator and a physicist at
Caltech.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Thorne said he thought the new calculation suggested
``that we are likely to see a very large number of black hole
mergers.''
</P>
<P>
   Because gravity waves are predicted by Einstein's relativity
theory, physicists would hail their detection as a major coup. The
possibility that LIGO will see gravity waves from black holes
brings an additional bonus, said Shapiro.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their terrific gravitational fields, space-time is
warped around black holes more strongly than anywhere else in the
universe, according to Einstein's equations of relativity.
</P>
<P>
   ``A gravitational wave is a direct messenger of that
space-time,'' Shapiro said. ``The upshot will be the first
confirmation of Einstein's theory of relativity'' where the fabric
of space-time is twisted almost beyond recognition, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   A highly respected neuroscientist has developed a provocative
new theory of how the brain is organized which, if confirmed, would
explain how and why the mind produces symptoms found in several
seemingly unrelated disorders.
</P>
<P>
   According to the theory, the deep sadness in severe depression,
the hand wringing in obsessive compulsive disorder, the ringing in
the ears of tinnitus, the unrelenting discomfort of chronic pain
and the shaking and immobility seen Parkinson's disease all stem
from the same basic brain defect _ a decoupling of two brain
regions that normally fire their cells in synchrony.
</P>
<P>
   If the theory is correct, it would explain why a experimental
surgical techniques involving implanting electrodes in the brain to
treat Parkinson's disease and depression seem to work so well, and
it would expand their application to other brain diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The neuroscientist, Dr. Rodolfo Llinas, a professor at New York
University Medical School, presented his findings on last Sunday
night in Miami to some 4,000 researchers attending the annual
Society for Neuroscience meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Although the theory has not yet been subjected to peer review, a
paper describing the work was submitted last week to Proceedings of
the National Academy of Sciences and accepted for publication in
just two days. Llinas is a member of the academy, which often
publishes the work of leading scientists or their proteges when the
ideas are new and have not yet been tested by others.
</P>
<P>
   ``This work is very important,'' said Dr. Edward Jones,
president of the Society for Neuroscience and director of the
Center for Neuroscience at the University of California in Davis.
``What makes it so compelling is that it doesn't come completely
out of left field. It builds on a body of work that's been growing
for some time. Everyone will say wow, yes!''
</P>
<P>
   Because these new insights into brain organization, if
confirmed, would almost certainly promote the use of surgery to
treat psychiatric and neurological diseases, other scientists urged
caution in applying the theory. They are concerned because
psychosurgeries that were tried 30 to 40 years ago in these same
regions of the brain made many people mentally incompetent.
</P>
<P>
   The theory involves two brain areas _ the cerebral cortex and
the thalamus _ and how they communicate.
</P>
<P>
   The cortex is a thickly folded band of tissue that carries out
higher mental capacities in humans and other mammals. It is
composed of six layers of cells that are highly interconnected and
organized into specialized regions that allow people to move their
bodies, plan for the future, talk, listen, sense touch, respond to
emotions and carry out other functions. The sixth layer of these
cells is also directly connected through nerve fibers to cells in
the thalamus, an older brain structure that is just under the
cortex.
</P>
<P>
   The thalamus is usually thought of as a relay station. Virtually
all information flowing from the outside world and lower brain
regions must go through the thalamus before being passed on to the
cortex.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Llinas, the thalamus does much more than simply
pass information. The way that it coordinates its activity with the
cortex, he says, gives rise not only to the symptoms seen in many
neurological and psychiatric diseases, but to consciousness itself.
</P>
<P>
   It does so through what Llinas calls thalamo-cortical
oscillations. The thalamus contains special cells that pass tiny
electrical currents across their membranes in a highly coordinated
manner, Llinas said in a telephone interview. Rather than firing
sporadically and singly, like other nerve cells, the cells in the
thalamus oscillate, firing in groups together at various
frequencies.
</P>
<P>
   By virtue of their connections, these thalamic cel cause
cells in layer six _ the layer of the cortex closest to them _ to
oscillate at the same frequency. This coordination between these
oscillating cells in the cortex and thalamus, which are constantly
flipping signals back and forth, binds information from different
regions of the brain into complete actions, perceptions, movements
and into consciousness itself, he said.
</P>
<P>
   When the cells oscillate at a high frequency, the brain is awake
and alert. When they fall into low frequencies, the brain becomes
disconnected, unconscious and falls asleep.
</P>
<P>
   In studying patients with various brain diseases, Llinas and his
colleagues noticed that particular regions of their thalamuses
oscillated at abnormally low frequencies, as if those regions were
asleep. When this happens, Llinas said, key parts of the cortex are
decoupled from the thalamus. Those parts of the cortex then become
overly excited because they are no longer under proper control, he
said, and symptoms of dysfunction emerge.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a defect in one tiny part of the thalamus that
projects to one of the higher areas controlling movements can cause
those movements to become uncoordinated. The result is the tremors
seen in Parkinson's disease. If the defect is a fraction of an inch
away, a different part of the region controlling movement is
affected, resulting in the rigidity seen in many patients.
</P>
<P>
   Chronic-pain sufferers also have sluggish regions of the
thalamus, Llinas said. Areas of the cortex that deal with pain
become overexcited, producing intense discomfort that does not
respond to drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Llinas speculates that the same underlying defect causes some
types of depression, most tinnitus and obsessive compulsive
disease. In each case, according to his theory, a part of the
thalamus is out of phase with the cortex which, unregulated,
produces symptoms of profound sadness, ringing in the ears or
endless hand washing.
</P>
<P>
   All these disorders might be treated by implanting electrodes
into the thalamus to break the abnormal oscillation patterns,
Llinas said. The most effective treatment for Parkinson's patients
who do not respond to drug therapy involves putting electrodes
directly into the thalamus.
</P>
<P>
   ``This breaks the abnormal disconnection and the person
immediately gets better,'' Llinas said. ``But you have to keep the
electrode in. It's like a pacemaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar surgeries have been tried successfully for chronic pain
and depression. In each case, the electrode is targeted on only a
few thousand cells.

<P>
   ROCKVILLE, Md. _ Two rival teams racing to decode the human
genome have each neared or passed significant milestones.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to tell which of the teams is ahead because they are
pursuing the same goal along different paths. But both are
apparently on track with ambitious schedules that call for ``first
drafts'' of the genome to be completed next spring or summer.
</P>
<P>
   The publicly financed consortium, a group of academic centers
mainly in the United States and Britain, said last week that it had
essentially decoded the first human chromosome, the 22d and
smallest of the 23 pairs.
</P>
<P>
   The decodable part of the chromosome is 33 million units of DNA,
or about 1 percent of the entire genome, which is at least three
billion units.
</P>
<P>
   Also last week the consortium's rival, the Celera Corp. of
Rockville, Md, said it had decoded its first billion units of human
DNA. But the decoded pieces are in short fragments, and the harder
part of the task is deciding how the fragments fit together.
</P>
<P>
   The public consortium, financed principally by the National
Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md, and the Wellcome Trust of
London, has been working to sequence the human genome since 1990.
It completed its pilot project, decoding the genome of the
laboratory roundworm, in December.
</P>
<P>
   Celera, headed by the genome sequencing pioneer Dr. J. Craig
Venter, jumped into the race only in May of last year. As the test
of his high-risk strategy, Venter chose to decode the DNA of
another standard laboratory organism, the Drosophila fruitfly,
which he said will be completed by January.
</P>
<P>
   At Celera's plant in Rockville, Md., the finishing touches were
being made last week to a futuristic control room that could be
modeled on that of the starship Enterprise. From an array of
monitors, supervisors will control the 300 DNA sequencing machines,
the robots that prepare fragments of DNA for analysis and a
HAL-sized computer that assembles the fragments into complete
genomes and analyses the babel of genetic data.
</P>
<P>
   In a nearby hall, a suite of DNA sequencing machines emitted a
deep-throated hum as they forced fragments of DNA through hair-fine
tubes where electric eyes read the sequence of bases, as the four
different units of DNA are known. In the computer room, a glitter
of green lights signaled the arrival of the DNA sequence
information through optic fiber switches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing a billion bases every three and a half weeks,''
Venter said during a tour of the plant. Corporate responsibilities
have forced him into the unusual costume of a suit and tie but not
dulled his delight in the sophisticated machines at his disposal or
the thrill of tackling a mountainous problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.'' Asked why the
hurry, he cited a need to file patent applications and quickly
build a genetic database for clients.
</P>
<P>
   Celera's sequencing strategy is quite different from the safe
and methodical approach of its rival. Essentially the consortium
bites off small fragments of known position in the genome and
decodes them one by one. Venter's idea is to tackle the whole
genome all at once and assemble all the pieces in one gigantic
jigsaw puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   With both team's strategies, the pieces of DNA analyzed by the
sequencing machines are typically 500 bases long. Because the
pieces are cut at random from the DNA in the genome, they tend to
overlap, and a computer's genome assembly program can easily fit
together contiguous pieces _ known as `contigs,' _ by matching the
overlapping ends.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that after the contigs have grown to a certain
size, the assembly program finds it cannot unambiguously match any
new ends. A chief reason for these gaps is that animal genomes are
full of repetitive DNA, regions where the same short string of DNA
units is repeated over and over.
</P>
<P>
   Without further information, the assembly program has no way of
determining how many of these repeated units lie in the gaps
between neighboring contigs.
</P>
<P>
   To bridge the gaps caused by the repetitive regions, the Celera
team relies on generating pieces of linking DNA from the genome
being decoded. The links are long DNA fragments of known length, of
which only the two ends are sequenced.
</P>
<P>
   Celera's assembly program can then position neighboring contigs
by looking for a bridging link that has one end matching DNA in one
contig and the other end matching the other. Enough links are
generated to insure that each neighboring pair of contigs is
spanned on average by at least two bridging link. With the size of
the gap established, it becomes much easier for the assembly
program to thread its way through the repetitive DNA between the
two contigs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The fruitfly genome formed the first large-scale test of this
strategy. By last month Celera's machines had produced 3.2 million
fragments of DNA, each about 500 bases long. Dr. Eugene W. Myers,
the chief designer of Celera's assembly program, said that he had
97 percent of the fruitfly genome, including virtually all of the
genes, in correctly assembled contigs. The remaining gaps are
mostly very small, he said, ``which bodes extremely well for our
strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   This refutes critics, Myers said, who had predicted ``that we
could not do the compute.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are absolutely not getting lost or fooled by the repeats _
we are navigating right around those babies,'' he said, expressing
confidence the fruitfly genome would be completed by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Rubin, a Drosophila expert at the University of
California at Berkeley who has been working with Celera scientists
on the fruit-fly project, said he had not yet seen their data but
that if everything had gone as they said, ``It looks like their
strategy has passed its test with flying colors.''
</P>
<P>
   Myers expects that the human genome, though more than 15 times
larger, may prove easier to assemble than the fruit fly's because
its repeated elements are more dissimilar and thus easier to
distinguish from each other.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the assembly of the human genome will require a computer
calculation of considerable size. Celera's powerful computer can
assemble the Drosophila genome in 12 hours but will need three
months for the human genome, Myers calculates. Since it will take a
year to generate the human sequence data, the plan is start the
computer on its assembly run before all the sequencing data is
available.
</P>
<P>
   To acquire the necessary degree of overlap between its DNA
fragments, a genome must be sequenced several times over. Having
switched its machines from fruit fly to human DNA, Celera expects
to have sequenced six billion bases by March and nine billion by
May or June. The latter figure, covering the genome three times
over, should suffice to complete the decoding of 97 percent of the
human genome, said Dr. Mark Adams, Celera's vice president for
genome programs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the consortium had by mid-October completed 446
million bases of sequence, about 14 percent of the human genome,
with a further 15 percent nearing completion. Most of the finished
sequence is in long, disconnected fragments, but a team led by Dr.
Ian Dunham of the Sanger Center, near Cambridge, England, has
almost completed chromosome 22, apart from 10 small gaps.
</P>
<P>
   Dunham says the chromosome contains 400 to 600 genes but he has
not yet looked for patterns in the chromosome that might reveal the
evolutionary logic of its construction.
</P>
<P>
   The public consortium is making its data public, believing that
medical and scientific progress depend on open access to the
sequence.
</P>
<P>
   Venter has also said he will make his primary human DNA sequence
available, but he intends to keep other information proprietary.
The primary DNA sequence will be of enormous medical importance,
but much commercially valuable information is expected to lie not
in the standard genome, but in the DNA variations commonly found in
the population. It is these variations, which can make a gene
perform better or worse, that help determine a person's
susceptibility to disease.
</P>
<P>
   Celera scientists intend to pick up many of these common
variations in their first human genome sequence, since they will
sequence both the maternal and paternal strands of DNA of an
individual and so pick up the differences between them. Celera will
also sequence several other people's genomes so as to generate a
large library of the common DNA variations.
</P>
<P>
   It now seems that it will be impossible to complete the human
genome in terms of sequencing every DNA base. The tips and central
region of each chromosome have so many repeated units that they are
essentially unsequenceable. Because of the difficulty of knowing
when everything possible has been done, it may be the human genome
race will have no sharply defined finishing post and no clear
winner.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Venter should come in first, it seems that the
consortium will attain its goal, that of seeing the human genome
sequence finished and placed in the public domain.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a recent autumn morning in a suite at his beloved
Chelsea Hotel, legendary New York City home of hipsters and
artists, Sir Arthur C. Clarke, 81, the author of more than a
hundred books of essays and science fiction, co-writer with Stanley
Kubrick of the film, ``2001: A Space Odyssey,'' and the dreamer who
in 1945 came up with the idea of the ``comsat,'' or communications
satellite, held court in a wheelchair tended by his two Sri Lankan
valets, Hector and Lenin.
</P>
<P>
   The author, who lives in Colombo, Sri Lanka, had stopped off to
see old friends and admirers on his way home from a round of
medical tests at Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is it true that you and Stanley Kubrick wrote the screenplay
for ``2001: A Space Odyssey,'' right here at the Hotel Chelsea?
</P>
<P>
   A. Absolutely. This place is my spiritual home. Everyone is
surprised that I come to this hardly five-star hotel.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Sri Lankan ambassador was horrified. Before coming
here, I had been at Johns Hopkins for more than a week.
</P>
<P>
   They took a nerve biopsy. I have some obscure neuropathy. All of
a sudden, my legs get numb. Mainly, I have post-polio syndrome,
which is why I can't walk anymore. I was told I had Lou Gehrig's
disease, originally.
</P>
<P>
   As far as I know, Stephen Hawking is the only man who's survived
that for very long, so this (laughs) is a considerable improvement.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. We heard that the astronaut Buzz Aldrin made a visit to you
at Hopkins. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, he dropped in to see me in the hospital and he kept
making the point: we've got to get NASA out of the space business.
He believes it should be private enterprise. There are a lot of
people now who are trying to develop relatively cheap
nonbureaucratic access to space. How successful they'll be, I don't
know. I think the rocket will end up doing for space travel what
the balloon did for air travel: it got us there, but soon was
superseded by something better. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are you as critical of NASA as Buzz Aldrin is? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I won't criticize NASA because it's the slave of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, NASA has now set up an Institute for Advanced
Concepts. It is looking at all sorts of crazy ideas, including my
favorite one, the space elevator. It's such a delightfully simple
idea: build an elevator from the Equator to a geostationary
satellite. You move payloads up and down by electricity.
</P>
<P>
   When I wrote my book ``The Fountains of Paradise'' in 1979,
about the building of the space elevator from a country which is 90
percent Sri Lanka, the only material that could be strong enough to
build a space elevator was diamond. And that, unfortunately was not
available in the megaton qualities needed for such a project.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, when I later recorded a 12-inch LP of ``The
Fountains of Paradise,'' the cover notes and illustration were by
Buckminster Fuller.
</P>
<P>
   And now, we have the material to make it: C-60 nanotubes, which
are hundreds of times stronger than steel.
</P>
<P>
   The Rice University scientists who were co-discoverers of C-60
have named it Buckminsterfullerene. If C-60 can be mass produced,
it will revolutionize space travel, as well as everyday life. You
could lift your car with one hand.
</P>
<P>
   The point of the space elevator is that it makes space travel
cost just pennies. The cost in electricity of lifting you to space
is about $200. The cost for a round trip is about $40 because you
get most of your energy back on the downward trip.I've said many
times that the main cost of space travel in the future is going to
be for catering and in flight movies, not for fuel.
</P>
<P>
   And of course the considerable interest on the trillion or so
that it costs to build the thing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. One reason you advocate space travel is fear of asteroids? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm always quoting the science fiction writer Larry Nivens
that ``the dinosaurs became extinct because they didn't have a
space program.'' Yes, I think a serious asteroid impact is
inevitable. In any case, even without them, we have all our eggs in
one basket here. By the way, I'm an absentee landlord of a hundred
square miles of some rather rugged territory near the orbit of
Mars. I have an asteroid named after me. Isaac Asimov's got one
too. It's smaller and more eccentric.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In the news is word that the world's population has hit six
billion. What do you feel when you see a headline like that?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, I feel rather depressed, but then there are so many
times when I'm an optimist. I think we have a 51 percent chance of
survival. I would say the next decade is perhaps one of the most
crucial in human history, though many people have felt that in the
past. But it's real now. There are so many things coming to a head
simultaneously. The population. The environment. The energy crunch.
And, of course, the dangers of nuclear warfare. I am often asked to
predict things and I'm described as a prophet, but I deny that. I'm
just an extrapolator. I can envision a whole spectrum of futures,
very few of which are desirable.
</P>
<P>
   But I do feel that we science-fiction writers do serve as an
early warning system, by showing what may happen, what could
happen, and simply what should happen. I've often said one reason
why I'm an optimist is that then you have a chance of creating a
self-fulfilling prophesy _ and ditto if you're a pessimist _ it's
more cheerful. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Can you think of something that you predicted might have
happened that doesn't look like it will?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, there won't be a Hilton in orbit by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Was it your idea or Kubrick's to make a computer, ``HAL,''
the villain of film? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Villain? HAL's a nice guy. No, I cannot now say who did what.
The only thing I'm completely sure of is that the idea of HAL lip
reading, which I thought was rather unlikely, was Stanley's. Now,
of course, they've succeeded in getting a fair degree of accuracy
with lip reading in computers. The way we wrote it, we just
brainstormed. We sat in this apartment and brainstormed.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley said, ``I want to do a good science-fiction film.'' So
we went through all my short stories to see what would make a good
film. We had about six. One by one, we threw away stories.
Eventually, we just had two of them. One was ``The Sentinel,'' and
the other was ``Encounter in the Dawn,'' in which a space ship
lands before man existed and the travelers meet man-apes. We were
originally going to call the film, ``How The Solar System Was
Won.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. One of the legends about you is that you came up with the
idea for Comsat in an article you wrote in 1945 and that you never
patented the idea.
</P>
<P>
   A. Oh, so you want to ask me about how I lost a billion dollars
in my spare time? Well, you see when I wrote my ``comsat'' paper,
it was 1945. The war was still on. No one could even imagine what
peace would be like. And I didn't think that satellites could be
launched until the end of the century. So I didn't give the matter
of a patent any thought at all. I just wrote this article and sent
it off and got (PS)15 for it. Which was real money in 1945. I don't
regret it because I think a patent would have expired anyway before
the first comsats were launched. Until the technology reaches some
level, you can't patent anything. Besides, who was it that said,
``The patent is merely a license to be sued?''
</P>
<P>
   Q. Surely you must sometimes fantasize about what your life
would have been if you had?
</P>
<P>
   A. OK, what I should have done is to try to copyright the word
``comsat.'' If I'd done that. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q. You've written somewhere near 100 books of science fact and
fiction. How fast do you write, and think?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Not as fast as I used to. I have difficulty remembering
names. But I feel as long as I can spell ``Alzheimer,'' I'm in good
shape. I don't know if I've ever written more than 3,000 words a
day. Isaac Asimov could do that in a minute and a half. And mostly
on a manual typewriter, too.
</P>
<P>
   Q. There are plaques mounted in front of the Hotel Chelsea
dedicated to deceased artists who once lived here: Thomas Wolfe,
Brendan Behan, Virgil Thomson. Will there be one for you one day?
</P>
<P>
   A. Oh, I hope so, but not for a long time. However, I don't mind
if they put one up right now.

 &HT;    TEEN PREGNANCY RATE FALLS SHARPLY, GOVERNMENT REPORTS
 &HT;    By RAVEN HILL
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The teenage birth rate has fallen sharply since
1991, with the highest rates of decline recorded among black women,
the federal government reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said the
decline was mainly due to three factors _ a fear of contracting
AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, a growing rejection
of casual sex, and welfare reform laws that sent a message to young
men about child support obligations.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, there were 51.1 births last year for each 1,000
women aged 15 to 19,
</P>
<P>
   the department reported. That was down 18 percent from a rate of
62.1 in 1991, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the improvement was due to a 26.1 percent decline in the
same period among black teenagers, to a rate of 88.2, and a 12.2
percent decline among Hispanic teenagers, to a rate of 97.3, the
department said.
</P>
<P>
   The figures give some hope to efforts aimed to curb teen
pregnancies and births, said Isabel Sawhill, president of the
National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lower rates of teen births are a result of less sex, more
contraception and a growing recognition among teens themselves that
their focus should be on education and growing up,'' Sawhill said
at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ``We believe the strength of teen pregnancy
programs is working in local communities,'' Shalala said.
</P>
<P>
   Sawhill said communities must take the initiative in reducing
teen pregnancies by implementing programs tailored to their needs,
adding that sex education in the schools is insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Teens need help negotiating their way through the pressures of
engaging and risky behavior, Shalala said.

   On Monday, the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy
released a manual to help communities design successful prevention
efforts. It contains the latest research on teen pregnancies and
provides strategies for after-school activities and building
fund-raising coalitions, Sawhill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal should be to maintain the momentum,'' Sawhill said.
``This manual is the chart book to keep us on course.''

JOBS CAN TAKE A TOLL ON TEENS

   UNDATED: The high school principal bent a knee toward the floor
and clasped his hands in supplication. ``I beg you,'' he beseeched.
``Write something about high school kids working.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three in 10 full-time high school students are employed.
According to government statistics, nine out of 10 of them work
less than 35 hours a week, but some hold full-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Educators aren't against students working. They know some
families need the income. They also know jobs can be terrific
teachers _ of responsibility, time management and career
preparation.
</P>
<P>
   But educators oppose students working more than 15 to 20 hours a
week. And they're really averse to teens working from the time
school lets out until shifts end at 10 p.m., 11 p.m. or later.
</P>
<P>
   Students who work long, late hours fall asleep at their desks
the next day. They may not be listening. They may not be
participating in school activities. They may not be learning.
</P>
<P>
   Walk in any high school classroom on any morning. The odds are
good you'll find at least two or three teens nodding off.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, science finds they may be wired that way. Sleep
research shows that the circadian rhythm of teen-age bodies
predisposes teens to stay up until 11 p.m. and sleep late into the
morning _ several hours past the typical high school start time.
</P>
<P>
   Sleep researchers also say teens need, but don't get, nine hours
of sleep a night.
</P>
<P>
   Students who close restaurants at 11 p.m. aren't likely to head
right to bed. They'll do homework (maybe, maybe not), get on the
Internet, watch television or talk on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   University professors say the problem doesn't stop at high
school graduation. They see lots of in-class sleepers. And what
really bugs teachers is that many young workers aren't motivated by
true financial need. Working is just ``the thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For what reason?'' a university educator asked. ``Many of them
don't need to work. They're living their lives in fast forward
instead of getting the maximum learning benefit available to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, I surveyed hundreds of teens for a report
on working teens. A majority said adults should chill out and let
them work. They wanted the money to buy things, they said. Besides,
there was plenty of time left to pursue loftier professional goals.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. But some teens, and apparently their parents, don't
have the good sense to put a lid on school-day work hours.
</P>
<P>
   The government imposes a limit of 18 hours a school week for 14-
and 15-year-old workers and forbids work after 7 p.m. for that age
group during the school year. I wouldn't want similar dictates for
16- to 18-year-olds. There are too many personal circumstances to
consider.
</P>
<P>
   But if teens and parents can't put reasonable limits on
school-day work hours, then the appeal goes to employers: Don't
hire full-time students to lock up, work late on school nights or
work full-time-equivalent hours during the school year.
</P>
<P>
   Doing well in school and learning should be teens' work. If
``invincible'' teens can't see they're being robbed, maybe you can.

 &HT;    CLINTON STOPS FOR PICTURES WITH SAILOR'S BIRTH-DAMAGED SON

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Georgina Denman believes her severely birth-damaged
son, Tyler, has a ``special and unusual effect'' on people.
</P>
<P>
   It worked on Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The wife of a Navy enlisted man, Denman recently managed to get
a few minutes with Clinton _ by merely asking to see him, even
though she did not have an appointment or advance clearance.
</P>
<P>
   She is convinced Tyler was the reason.
</P>
<P>
   Denman is a member of a small group of active-duty wives who
call themselves ``Casualties of Tricare.'' They have been trying
for several years to get the Defense Department to change a
controversial policy that denies skilled nursing care to some
military dependents on the grounds that their conditions cannot be
improved.
</P>
<P>
   Active-duty and retiree dependents are left to get care through
Medicaid or charity, often a difficult and humiliating process.
</P>
<P>
   When Tyler was born, complications left him without oxygen for
19 minutes. His heart had stopped beating and he was left
neurologically damaged. He is kept alive by a respirator, an array
of monitors and other the machines and the constant attention of a
pediatric nurse.
</P>
<P>
   For three years, the Defense Department's Tricare program paid
for Tyler's nursing care.
</P>
<P>
   However, Denman said, Tricare case managers warned her
repeatedly that they might shift him to ``custodial care'' status.
</P>
<P>
   The term is dreaded by Tricare beneficiaries with children or
other dependents who must have skilled nursing care. Tricare
defines custodial care patients to include those who have no hope
of recovery, even if the care is necessary to keep them alive.
Although the program pays for some benefits, including one doctor
visit a month, it will not pay for skilled nursing care.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1998, Tyler's status was changed and his nursing care
terminated.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of sympathetic Orange County, Calif., officials,
she got him approved for Medicaid. Her husband, Hospital Corpsman
2c John Denman, commutes to his work as an instructor at Camp
Pendleton, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tyler would not survive without this care,'' Georgina Denman
said.
</P>
<P>
   This year, active-duty mothers of disabled children mounted a
campaign to get the Tricare policy changed. Largely because of
their efforts, next year's Defense Department appropriations bill
requires Tricare to provide ``all medically necessary health care
... regardless of the health care status.''
</P>
<P>
   During the mothers' lobbying campaign, Denman came to
Washington, bringing Tyler and his nurse, Temple Fee, to talk with
members of Congress and Tricare officials about the policy.
</P>
<P>
   When she learned Clinton was in a meeting, down the hall from a
reception she was attending, she went to the nearest Secret Service
agent and asked if she could please speak with the president of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him my husband was a Navy corpsman and asked him if
there was any chance in a bahzillion my little boy could see the
president,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Eying Tyler, asleep in his wheelchair, the Secret Service agent
shook his head and explained to her that requests like hers had to
be approved in advance... and he'd really like to help her...and
there was no way... and...well, he'd check.
</P>
<P>
   Denman, Fee, Tyler and Edith Smith, a volunteer military family
advocate, waited in a coffee shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a while, the agent came running in there and told us to
come on and to hurry,'' Denman said.
</P>
<P>
   The agent stationed the group near a door and after a few
minutes Clinton came through.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president came right over and said hello to Temple and
me,'' Denman said. ``I told him I was from Arkansas and I was a
Navy wife we were here to lobby for military health care reform.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Clinton put his hand on Tyler's head and she told him,
``This is my son, Tyler.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tyler, it's an honor to meet you,'' Clinton said as a White
House photographer took pictures.
</P>
<P>
   And her son?
</P>
<P>
   ``Tyler has a strange and wonderful effect on people,'' she
said. ``He's beautiful, and they are attracted to him. But he slept
through the whole thing.''

NEW HOPE FOR CANCER VICTIMS: BURN LIVER TUMORS AWAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Sewell examined the young cancer patient's entire
abdominal cavity with ultrasound, searching for any additional
lesions before he deployed a five-pronged probe, armed with
electrical energy, to destroy the large tumor growing in the middle
of her liver.
</P>
<P>
   Three minutes after the probe began heating up, steam seemed to
rise from the malignant cells. Temperature monitors at the tip of
each prong registered 100 degrees centigrade. The tumor began to
lose its pink color after about 10 minutes, and with five
overlapping follow-up burns actually began to look scorched.
</P>
<P>
   The cancer was dying of the heat _ the tumor burned away in the
operating room at Harris Methodist HEB in Fort Worth while I
watched, along with several surgeons, including one from Houston
who was on hand to learn more about laparoscopic thermal ablation
of cancerous liver tumors.
</P>
<P>
   Radiofrequency Interstitial Tissue Ablation (RITA), as the new
minimally invasive treatment is named, offers hope to people with
cancerous tumors in the liver, especially the estimated 75 percent
whose tumors cannot be surgically removed at diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Christi Herb, 37, found a lump under her arm that
turned out to be a swollen lymph node that had already been invaded
by malignant cells from the 3-centimeter tumor discovered in her
left breast.
</P>
<P>
   Ten of the 26 lymph nodes tested were positive for the cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a mastectomy plus four rounds of chemotherapy starting
last September,'' recalls Herb, who lives in Keller near Fort Worth
with her husband and two young sons. ``Then in January, I had a
bone-marrow transplant with high-dose chemo, and in March and April
I had 51/2 weeks of radiation.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the aggressive treatment, a CAT scan in July _ six
months after the bone-marrow transplant _ showed a shadow on her
liver.
</P>
<P>
   The needle biopsy was inconclusive, but the tumor was growing so
quickly, she opted for a laparoscopic biopsy and the new thermal
ablation treatment. The shadow turned out to be a 5-centimeter
(golfball-size) tumor in the middle of her liver. A quick biopsy
found it malignant, and Sewell went forward with the heat ablation.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this, we can completely obliterate the tumor with no open
surgery,'' said Sewell, a general surgeon. ``There is much less
risk and less trauma to the patient, and we are able to treat
multiple lesions that we couldn't treat in the past. The exciting
thing to us is to discover something different that benefits the
patients we previously couldn't help at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Followed by chemotherapy to rid the body of any cancer not
directly ablated by the heat probe, laparoscopic thermal ablation
is becoming a viable option for treatment of tumors in the liver.
</P>
<P>
   Sewell learned the procedure from Dr. Alan Siperstein of the
Cleveland Clinic, who did the first in this country in January 1996
and reported on his first 57 cases at this year's annual meeting of
the Society for Surgical Oncology.
</P>
<P>
   Results of the trial testing the safety and efficacy of the
procedure will not be published until next month, but Siperstein
says laparoscopic thermal ablations are very safe and may be as
efficient at destroying tumors as traditional resection (surgical
removal of the tumor).
</P>
<P>
   ``The great advantage is recovery time,'' Siperstein said, ``a
day instead of a week in the hospital, and a couple of days versus
a month or more to completely recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our trial, which is still ongoing, we have a very low rate
of complications and an 88 percent success rate in destroying liver
tumors. Only 12 percent of them have come back,'' said Siperstein,
whose study recently was expanded to include 65 patients because
the initial results were so good.
</P>
<P>
   Patients enrolled in the study had all failed first-line
treatment _ which is surgery, if possible, and chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Results are quite encouraging,'' Siperstein said in a
telephone interview. ``We started this with very cautious optimism.
At this point, I'm very optimistic. It has the potential for cure,
and it's clearly safer than cryosurgery'' (a treatment that freezes
the tumor tissue but often causes extensive bleeding and cannot be
used if the tumor is near a major blood vessel).
</P>
<P>
   Sewell said the new treatment adds significantly to what doctors
have to offer patients for liver cancers, which kill 1.25 million
people worldwide each year.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   The new procedure was developed in Italy, where most liver
cancer is primary (that is, it originates in the liver), rather
than metastatic (spread to the liver from another site). But the
treatment works equally well for other types of liver tumors.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we all want is what is safest for our patients and
creates the highest possibility of success,'' said Sewell. ``This
is one more treatment option, but for many liver tumors it is
ideal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know if it is equivalent to surgical resection yet,
but only about 25 percent of the time is surgery even possible.
Thermal ablation is not nearly so traumatic to the patient, and it
can be used in many patients whose cancer cannot be surgically
removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Radiofrequency ablation is unproven, but to sit back and do
nothing for a patient with liver cancer is unacceptable,'' Sewell
said.
</P>
<P>
   David Wise, 52, of nearby Bedford, had open surgery in June 1998
to remove what was thought to be a benign tumor in his small
intestine. Not only was the tumor malignant, but it had spread to
three spots on the liver as well. Only one could be removed at the
time of surgery; the other two involved too much of the liver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chemotherapy was the only treatment available, but six months
of chemo, four days each month, four hours per day, did nothing to
shrink those last two
</P>
<P>
   tumors,'' Wise said. ``They didn't get any bigger, they just
stayed the same.''
</P>
<P>
   He underwent thermal ablation in February and has had CAT scans
every three months since then. They show that the two tumors are
dead and have shrunk almost to the point of disappearing as new
liver tissue grows and replaces the dead tissue. There is no sign
of any new lesions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a very rare type of cancer that has a five-year survival
rate of only 15 percent, but now with this new procedure I'm as
good as new,'' Wise said. ``It was like a death sentence was
lifted. ... I feel like I have a second lease on life. I just hope
I keep all my tumors in places that can be treated with this.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Herb, she was cheering on the sidelines at both her sons'
soccer games three days after the surgery. Her treatment required
only one night in the hospital, and she wasn't sure that was
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``God has just really blessed me through all of this,'' said
Herb. ``My final goal is to get my life back. I want to have breast
reconstruction with all my own tissue, but the timing is up to God.
I think he made this available just in time for me. I just rely on
God and trust him to get me through each procedure.''

LAPAROSCOPY: MORE AND MORE USES
</HEADLINE>
 
(With BC-CANCER-TREATMENT) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) c.1999 Fort Worth
Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   First introduced about 20 years ago to explore the cause of
pelvic pain and infertility, laparoscopy is used to surgically
treat as well as diagnose many diseases, especially in the
abdominal and chest areas.
</P>
<P>
   Latest on the list of ``keyhole'' surgeries are gastric and
coronary bypasses and placement of the metal rods used to
straighten the spine and treat scoliosis.
</P>
<P>
   The minimally invasive surgery now is used routinely to remove
diseased gallbladders and appendixes, extract fibroids and ovarian
cysts, repair hernias, perform tubal ligations and reverse them,
obtain biopsies, assist in hysterectomies, treat endometriosis and
open blocked veins causing male infertility.
</P>
<P>
   Laporoscopy uses a scope with a tiny light and camera attached,
a TV monitor and at least two tiny incisions for the hollow metal
tubes through which miniature surgical instruments are inserted and
manipulated.
</P>
<P>
   Laparoscopy is credited in large part with the fact that nearly
half of all surgery today is ambulatory, or performed on an
outpatient basis.
</P>
<P>
   Many doctors believe traditional, open surgery will be a rarity
in 10 years because laparoscopy spares the patient much of the
trauma of open surgery, can be done with much less anesthesia and
greatly reduces recovery time. It also saves money because hospital
stays are shortened or eliminated.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In an experimental operation last Thursday that one
doctor called ``great work'' but another called ``preposterous,''
surgeons in Brooklyn removed a woman's ovaries, sliced them into
thin strips and implanted them into her arm.
</P>
<P>
   The patient, in her 30s, has cervical cancer, and the reason for
the seemingly outlandish procedure was to protect her ovaries from
the radiation treatment she will be getting. The radiation would
very likely damage her ovaries and plunge her prematurely into
menopause, bringing on the bone-thinning disorder osteoporosis and
other problems caused by the sudden loss of estrogen. (Menopause
can be forestalled by estrogen-replacement therapy, but the woman,
who allowed a reporter and photographer to watch the operation only
on the condition of anonymity, refused the pills in favor of the
experimental surgery.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, when her pelvis is irradiated, she will simply have to
raise her arm over her head to keep the ovarian tissue out of the
way. No one knows whether ovarian tissue can live in a person's
arm, but the surgeon who devised the procedure, Dr. Kutluk Oktay of
New York Methodist Hospital in Brooklyn, said he hoped the strips
would survive and act like a normal ovary, producing enough
estrogen to prevent menopause.
</P>
<P>
   Although the patient in Brooklyn wanted the ovarian surgery to
prevent menopause, Oktay said that if the method worked, the real
goal was to use it to preserve fertility in young women hoping to
have children after being treated for cancer. Eggs might be easily
harvested from a patient's arm, he said, and used for in vitro
fertilization, in which they would be fertilized in the laboratory
and then implanted in the patient's uterus to start a pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   The research is part of a larger pattern of efforts to find ways
to enable people to have families after being treated for cancer,
particularly young people who have good odds of being cured of
certain cancers like leukemia and bone tumors. The approach is in a
highly experimental field that has yet to make parents of anyone.
Nonetheless, many patients have pinned their hopes on the research.
</P>
<P>
   For young people with cancer, particularly those who have not
yet had children, it can be devastating to learn that the
chemotherapy and radiation given to save their lives will also
leave them sterile. Taking steps to try to have children later may
be the utmost expression of faith and hope.
</P>
<P>
   But only men have been able to plan for a future, by having
sperm frozen before undergoing radiation or chemotherapy. Women
have not had a similar option.
</P>
<P>
   Eggs, unlike sperm, do not survive freezing. Fertilized eggs do,
but women with cancer may not be able to spend the time and take
the hormones needed to stimulate the ovaries to produce the eggs
needed for in vitro fertilization. .
</P>
<P>
   ``For women who have not completed their families, being a
parent is very, very important,'' said Dr. Lynn Hartmann, an
oncologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. ``They may have a
cancer with a good prognosis. To look for options for these women
is very important.''
</P>
<P>
   One option under study is to remove an ovary, freeze it before
cancer treatment and reimplant it later. The technique works in
animals; mice and sheep have given birth after having frozen
ovaries reimplanted.
</P>
<P>
   Although some clinics have been experimentally freezing human
ovaries, and at least one is selling the service, no woman has yet
had a baby as a result.
</P>
<P>
   But in September, Oktay and his colleagues announced that frozen
ovarian tissue had begun working again after being reimplanted in a
patient, a young woman whose ovaries had been removed at another
hospital because of a noncancerous disorder. One of the ovaries
turned out to be healthy and was cut into strips and frozen, and
two years later, when the patient was 30, Oktay's team sewed the
strips to a scaffold made of surgical foam, which they implanted in
her abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, given hormones that made eggs mature, the
woman ovulated and then had a menstrual period. Her case was the
first on record in which frozen ovarian tissue began to function
again. (She may be able to become pregnant, but would need in vitro
fertilization, because her Fallopian tubes were removed.)
</P>
<P>
   Oktay cautions that ovary freezing is unlikely to work for women
over 30, because they have fewer eggs than younger women and some
eggs are lost in the processing. By the time the tissue is thawed,
he said, there may not be enough healthy eggs left to achieve a
pregnancy or to produce the hormones needed to keep menopause at
bay.
</P>
<P>
   That limitation on freezing for women in their 30s helped
inspire him to try last week's operation. A standard procedure for
sparing the woman's ovaries had been rejected: Doctors sometimes
surgically relocate the ovaries within the abdomen to get them out
of the way of radiation. But in this case, the doctors did not
think it would work.
</P>
<P>
   So Dr. Katherine Economos removed the patient's ovaries, and
Oktay sliced them into 16 thin strips that he and Dr. James
Rucinski could slip under the skin of the arm. The strips would be
better able than large segments to absorb nutrients from the nearby
tissue and establish a blood supply.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is not as farfetched as it may seem: a similar
technique has been used successfully for about 20 years in
operations on the parathyroid glands, which are sometimes
transferred from the neck to the arm.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one knows whether it will work with ovaries. The woman
will receive chemotherapy with the radiation, and the doctors could
not be certain that the low doses given for cervical cancer would
not harm the ovarian tissue. Higher doses given for other types of
cancer do cause infertility.
</P>
<P>
   The team estimated that it would take six months before they
could tell whether the tissue was doing its job. Only one other
woman has undergone the procedure, about six months ago, and Oktay
said he still could not tell whether it had succeeded. In any case,
even if the strips do work, there is no telling how long they will
last.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking a chance,'' Dr. Economos said.

 NEW YORK: Economos said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oktay said that eventually it might be possible to combine the
two techniques he has been studying. If the fresh tissue
transplanted into his patients' arms works, he said it might also
work to put frozen ovarian strips _ from a patient whose ovary had
to be removed before chemotherapy, for instance _ back into the arm
instead of the pelvis. The advantage, he said, is that it would be
much easier to harvest eggs from the arm for in vitro
fertilization. But women with intact Fallopian tubes might prefer
to have the tissue put back into the abdomen, to give them a chance
to become pregnant naturally, without in vitro fertilization.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Grifo, director of reproductive endocrinology at New
York University Medical Center, said that for now, ovary freezing
and relocating should be performed only as research, as Oktay is
doing, and not offered to patients as if they were a proven
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Patients must be informed that no babies have been born as a
result, Grifo emphasized, adding that publicity about the research
had misled people into thinking that the procedures had already
been shown to work. He said some women had mistakenly believed that
they could postpone childbearing, freeze an ovary and get it back
years or even decades later to start a family. There is no proof
that can be done, and it may not be good for a woman to have a
healthy ovary removed needlessly.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer patients who will become sterile anyway have less to lose
by giving up an ovary, but they also must be told that the
procedure is highly experimental, Grifo said. He does not perform
it or recommend it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a patient with breast cancer who wanted me to take out
her ovary and freeze it,'' he said. ``I said I couldn't do it. When
I told her we don't know if you can make viable eggs, she just lost
it. People don't want to hear the truth. The technology is not
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would I expose somebody to the risks of general anesthesia
and surgery, and then freeze the ovaries by techniques nobody has
shown you can get a viable egg from? Why would you have eggs taken
out at a time when you're very sick, so on top of the disease
you're going through an expensive, time-consuming, physically
draining procedure?''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Maurie Markman, director of the Cleveland Clinic Cancer
Center, called the ovary transplant into the patient's arm
``preposterous,'' adding: ``An operation on a lady with advanced
cancer so she can have estrogen coming out of her arm, so she can
avoid taking a pill? It's nuts.'' But he said that if effective
techniques were developed to preserve women's fertility after
cancer treatment, ``I wouldn't have a problem with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Grifo said: ``This is great work. It should continue. There's a
lot of things we can learn by doing it.''

<P>
   Hospitals may not be called pest houses anymore, but they are
still terrible places to be sick. They are all crawling with
bacteria, with strangers who are sometimes kindly but sometimes
not, with the potential for bad accidents; hospitals assault the
senses from every direction, and then they send a bill.
</P>
<P>
   No, from time immemorial it has always been far better, if
possible, to be sick at home, surrounded by familiar comforts and
tended by a devoted relative or friend.
</P>
<P>
   But that part of the picture is changing fast. Those devoted
attendants have much more complicated jobs than they once did.
Medical science is saving more lives, at the price of creating more
people with serious chronic medical problems who need continuing
expert care.
</P>
<P>
   And the hospital is no longer the site of most of that care:
increasingly portable technology (not to mention rising costs)
means that the deep desire of every sick person to get out of the
hospital right this minute can generally be accommodated.
</P>
<P>
   But while the technology can easily travel home, no one has yet
figured out a way to get the hospital staff home too.
</P>
<P>
   So instead, a vast, silent volunteer army has grown up: millions
of Americans who do unpaid service as health care providers, with
many of the skills of the professionals but none of the salary, by
caring for sick relatives and friends at home.
</P>
<P>
   A study published in March in the policy journal Health Affairs
estimated this work force at 25.8 million people as of 1997, each
working an average of 18 hours a week. If they were all paid an
hourly wage commensurate with their duties _ from the unskilled
labor of changing bed linen to the highly technical work of
adjusting machines and administering medications _ their economic
value would come to $196 billion, about 18 percent of total
national health care spending for 1997 and six times the $32
billion Americans formally spent on home care that year.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators and policy makers pay attention to numbers like
these, as witnessed by the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 and
the tax credit proposal for home care givers now under
consideration in Congress. But, as virtually anybody who has ever
spent time caring for a sick person knows well, the professional
custodians of the nation's health have yet to give these millions
of new colleagues their due.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and nurses, therapists and social workers, well
intentioned though they may be, still tend to think in the old
authoritarian patterns. The patient is their patient; they are in
charge; they know best. Just leave them alone to do their work.
Please.
</P>
<P>
   What little training the professionals get in the art of
negotiating shared responsibilities is generally devoted to the
tangled politics of getting along with one another. Doctors and
nurses are still scrapping in the Hundred Years' War; few have the
insight or energy left over to negotiate the same issues with third
parties. In fact, in surveys that ask health professionals what
makes their jobs most difficult, many immediately reply,
``Families.''
</P>
<P>
   But consider this multiple-choice question (not to be found
among the millions that line the path into the caring professions):
A doctor sees a patient for 15 minutes once a month, a visiting
nurse drops in once a week, a therapist spends an hour or so every
few days, an aide comes in for the morning shift.
</P>
<P>
   A caretaking spouse, child or parent is there for the duration,
learning what the pills look like and how they go down, how to
change the bandages and what to do when the machinery at the
bedside starts beeping at 3 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Whose patient is it?
</P>
<P>
   It is small wonder that a grass-roots movement is slowly taking
shape in the ranks of these family caregivers, asking for a little
more acknowledgment from medical professionals, a little more
education and a lot more respect.
</P>
<P>
   One of their most eloquent voices has been that of Carol Levine,
a health policy researcher with the United Hospital Fund in New
York. Ms. Levine's work with children orphaned by the AIDS epidemic
earned her a MacArthur Foundation ``genius'' grant in 1993. Now she
spends most workdays on a long-term project that aims to bring
family caregivers out of the shadows into the forefront of health
policy decisions.
</P>
<P>
   At night, she joins the caregivers' ranks, tending to her
husband, Howard, 71, who was injured in an automobile accident in
1990. Once a sharp, energetic public relations executive, Levine is
bedbound and largely paralyzed, with serious brain damage.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years of hands-on caregiving have given Ms. Levine an
intimate familiarity with the rough patches of the terrain.
Unreliable ambulette service, irresponsible insurers and a new
wheelchair that is an inch too wide to fit into the dentist's
office are bad, she said in an interview. But any prolonged
interaction with doctors and hospitals is generally even worse.
</P>
<P>
   Levine has required periodic hospitalizations over the years,
and making the transfer between hospital and home is always a
nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the hospital, they think they're the experts and you're
just the family,'' she said. ``But I am an expert. I'm an expert in
(italics)him.''(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   And then, when it is time to go home, all the responsibility is
suddenly hers again. She is the effector arm of the doctors' plans,
the key to their success or failure. Even so, she is regularly sent
off with a minimum of explanation or training for any new
conditions, medications or equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Levine has to date supervised the disbursement of about $1.5
million in grant money to hospitals in the New York area for an
assortment of projects to help home caregivers do their job. But no
institution has yet taken her up on her most revolutionary
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``All professionals in training should spend a day entirely on
their own in a household like mine,'' she said. Not to make a house
call, or a home visit, she emphasized, or to accomplish a series of
discrete tasks, but to live the total experience _ the stretches of
boredom and the moments of sheer terror, all played out in the
complete isolation of the home.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day out of all those years of training,'' she said. ``Is
that too much to ask?''

EXPLORING THE SOURCE AND THE POWER OF GAMMA RAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ala., N.M., Ill., Calif., Utah)   (Science Times)

<P>
   Ancient sky watchers saw the heavens as a kind of cosmic
sculpture garden, eternal and unchanging.
</P>
<P>
   But modern astronomers who study huge explosions called gamma
ray bursts are discovering a universe that is more like a wild,
all-night disco party. And with the help of a new generation of
gamma ray observatories, astronomers say the party is just
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   At a conference in Huntsville, Ala., last week, astronomers
reported that one new detector, Milagro in the Jemez Mountains of
New Mexico, has apparently recorded the most energetic radiation
ever seen from a gamma ray burst, nearly a trillion electron volts.
</P>
<P>
   The observations suggest that gamma ray bursts _ already
considered the most violent events in the universe _ may be even
more energetic than had been believed, raising new questions about
the source of their power.
</P>
<P>
   During the conference, several scientists reported that the
tremendous energies of gamma ray bursts make them both mysterious
and useful. The flashes of radiation are so brilliant, said Dr.
Donald Q. Lamb, an astrophysicist at the University of Chicago,
that new, gamma-sensitive satellites can use them to study the
formation of stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bursts might actually reveal the moment of first light,''
Lamb said. ``This just breaks open a whole host of wonderful
possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   The first stars, Lamb explained, probably formed when the
universe was hundreds of millions of years old, so they would now
be billions of light-years away and could never be seen in their
own light. But if some of the massive early stars exploded as gamma
ray bursts, astronomers could study the epoch. The gamma rays would
carry fingerprints of the gases through which they passed, yielding
information about star formation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bursts are like beacons, flashing us messages from the
early universe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lamb and other scientists said gamma ray bursts, the most
rollicking phenomena in the universe, could soon become the most
revealing.
</P>
<P>
   In traditional astronomy, ``you'd sit at the telescope all night
and look at your data slowly come in,'' said Dr. Neil Gehrels, an
astrophysicist at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and the
principal investigator of a $163 million satellite called the Swift
Gamma Ray Burst Explorer, which the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration will launch in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we can look at other wavelength bands, we've discovered
that the sky is transient and changing all the time,'' Gehrels
said. ``People didn't realize that in the classical astronomy.''
</P>
<P>
   The new instruments go beyond Swift and Milagro, a $3 million
detector whose name means ``miracle'' in Spanish. NASA has
scheduled a launch in January of the $20 million High Energy
Transient Explorer, or HETE-2, which is intended to detect
gamma-ray bursts and relay their coordinates to observatories
almost instantly.
</P>
<P>
   A much more ambitious NASA project, the $270 million Gamma Ray
Large Area Space Telescope, could be launched by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   ``A new field of astronomy is opening up,'' said Dr. Gerald J.
Fishman, an astrophysicist at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center
who was one of the conference's organizers.
</P>
<P>
   This rush of data comes as astronomers have begun closing in on
the locations and reasons for the bursts. Discovered by chance in
the 1960s, gamma ray bursts are detected about once a day from
random points in the sky. Detectors on satellites usually make the
measurements, since Earth's atmosphere is opaque to gamma rays, a
form of radiation that is 100,000 times more energetic than
ordinary light.
</P>
<P>
   For decades after the discovery of gamma ray bursts, astronomers
could not determine whether they were exploding nearby, in this
galaxy, or deep in space. But two years ago, observations focusing
on the optical ``afterglows'' of some bursts, analogous to the
dying embers of a fire, were able to fix distances to some of them.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Those distances turned out to be as great as 10 billion
light-years. In order to be visible from those distances, gamma ray
bursts had to be the most powerful blasts since the Big Bang, the
explosion under one theory in which the universe was thought to
have originated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that gamma ray bursts are the most
brilliant objects in the universe,'' said Dr. Shrinivas Kulkarni,
an astronomer at the California Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, observations by Kulkarni and others have
suggested that the bursts might channel their energy in a beam,
like a flashlight. If the beam happens to be pointed toward Earth,
a brilliant flash could result from a less energetic explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have evidence that beaming is taking place,'' said Dr.
Tsvi Piran of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Beaming would
still require immense energy, Piran said.
</P>
<P>
   Theorists do not yet understand how so much energy can be
released as gamma rays in so short a time. The ``best bet
candidates,'' said Piran, involve the sudden collapse of a very
massive star or the collision of two superdense objects called
neutron stars.
</P>
<P>
   To investigate the sources of such transient and energetic gamma
rays, astronomers built the Milagro, a collaborative effort
involving Los Alamos National Laboratory and eight universities.
The detector consists of hundreds of light detectors called
phototubes floating within a pond containing six million gallons of
water.
</P>
<P>
   The pond is covered to prevent stray light from setting off the
phototubes. But the detector can sense radiation with energies at
least 10 times as great as any that have been seen from gamma ray
bursts so far. The radiation itself would be stopped by the upper
atmosphere but would start a shower of particles that could pass
through the cover and reach the water in the pond.
</P>
<P>
   There, through interactions with the water, those particles
would generate weak trails of light called Cherenkov emission that
the phototubes would pick up, providing information about the
direction and the energy of the gamma rays. The device operates
continuously, waiting for brief bursts of particles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows us to look for things that go blip,'' said Brenda
Dingus, an astrophysicist at the University of Utah who
collaborates on the project. Milagro began operating last spring.
</P>
<P>
   But the results presented at the conference by another
University of Utah astrophysicist, Dr. Julie McEnery, came from
data collected by a smaller prototype called Milagrito.
</P>
<P>
   During one of about 50 gamma ray bursts monitored by Milagrito,
a shower of particles appeared from the direction of the burst,
suggesting the arrival of what astronomers refer to as TeV
radiation, for ``tera-electron volt,'' a trillion electron volts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best evidence to date of a transient TeV source,''
said Dr. Gus Sinnis, physicist and Milagro collaborator at Los
Alamos National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Sinnis and the other collaborators said, however, that there was
a chance of about one in a thousand that the detection could be a
fluke, and that TeV radiation from the bursts would have to be seen
by the larger detector before it could be considered a fact.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Dr. Ed Fenimore, an astrophysicist at Los Alamos National
Laboratory, who is not part of the project, called the early result
exciting, because it would indicate that material in the explosion
``has to be moving even closer to the speed of light than we
thought.'' The higher the speed, the more energy would be required,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several astrophysicists said that the apparent absence of TeV
radiation from most of the bursts would not come as a complete
surprise _ even if they emitted it _ because the universe itself is
not entirely transparent to such energetic radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not all bursts emit such radiation, their brilliance
should be much more visible when all the new detectors are working,
said Lamb of the University of Chicago.

   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ A human skull that is prominently
displayed at the National Museum here has been attracting crowds
and controversy in equal measure since it was first unveiled early
this month. After two decades in storage, the fossilized cranium
has now been identified by Brazilian scientists as the oldest human
remains ever recovered in the Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   The skull is that of a young woman, nicknamed Luzia, who is
believed to have roamed the savannah of south-central Brazil some
11,500 years ago. Even more startling, a reconstruction of her
cranium undertaken in Britain this year indicates that her features
appear to be Negroid rather than Mongoloid, suggesting that the
Western Hemisphere may have initially been settled not only earlier
than thought, but by a people distinct from the ancestors of
today's South American Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can no longer say that the first colonizers of the Americas
came from the north of Asia, as previous models have proposed,''
said Dr. Walter Neves, an anthropologist at the University of Sao
Paulo, who made the initial discovery along with an Argentine
colleague, Hector Pucciarelli. ``This skeleton is nearly 2,000
years older than any skeleton ever found in the Americas, and it
does not look like those of Amerindians or North Asians.''
</P>
<P>
   If the date is confirmed, the find could transform thinking
about the peopling of the Americas. It may be some time before that
work is completed, but meanwhile, archeologists here and abroad say
the find is potentially very important.
</P>
<P>
   Until Luzia, named as a playful homage to Lucy, the
3.2-million-year-old human ancestor found in Africa, the oldest
known human remains recovered in the Western Hemisphere were those
of a woman found in Buhl, Idaho, and repatriated to the Shoshone
tribe in 1991. Radiocarbon dating tests have established the age of
that skeleton as a bit more than 10,000 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Luzia's discovery at a location in the state of Minas Gerais
called Lapa Vermelha is consistent, however, with recent findings
made at the celebrated Monte Verde site in southern Chile. There,
evidence of human habitation as early as 12,500 years ago,
including stone tools and a footprint, has been uncovered, though
no human remains have yet been found.
</P>
<P>
   The finds, along with recent discoveries in North America like
those of the so-called Kennewick Man and Spirit Cave Man, are
forcing a reassessment of long-established theories as to the
settling of the Americas. Based on such evidence, Neves suggests
that Luzia belonged to a nomadic people who began arriving in the
New World as early as 15,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Luzia's Negroid features notwithstanding, Neves is not arguing
that her ancestors came to Brazil from Africa in an early
trans-Atlantic migration. Instead, he believes they originated in
Southeast Asia, ``migrating from there in two directions, south to
Australia, where today's aboriginal peoples may be their
descendants, and navigating northward along the coast and across
the Bering Straits until they reached the Americas.''
</P>
<P>
   About one-third of Luzia's skeleton has been recovered, enough
to indicate that she appears to have perished in an accident or
perhaps even from an animal attack. She was in her 20s when she
died, stood just under 5 feet, and was part of a group of
hunter-gatherers who appear to have subsisted largely on whatever
fruits, nuts and berries they came across in their meanderings,
plus the occasional piece of meat.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is intriguing and interesting and I want to know more,''
Dr. David J. Meltzer, a professor of anthropology at Southern
Methodist University and an expert on the paleo-Indian populations
of North America, said in a telephone interview from Dallas.
``Skeletal material of this age is extraordinarily rare, both here
and in South America, so I am delighted to know that something of
this antiquity is popping up.''
</P>
<P>
   The region where Neves and his associates are working has been
the focus of archeological inquiry since the mid-19th century, when
Peter Wilhelm Lund, a Danish naturalist, first encountered human
skeletal remains there. Many of the specimens he uncovered are now
stored at the University of Copenhagen, but when Neves went to
examine them, he found that the material had not been catalogued by
geological strata and therefore could not be used for his research.
</P>
<P>
   Luzia herself was originally discovered in 1975 in a rock
shelter by a joint French-Brazilian expedition that was working not
far from Belo Horizonte, Brazil's third-largest city. The skull was
buried under more than 40 feet of mineral deposits and debris,
separated from the rest of the skeleton but otherwise in remarkably
good condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a site where the soil was high in limestone content,
which helped to preserve these remains for so long,'' explained
Andre Prous, a French archeologist at the federal University of
Minas Gerais, who was part of the initial team and continues to
work in the area. ``In other places, the bones disappear after a
short time.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with other material from the same expedition, Luzia was
then taken to the national museum here. But she was put away in
storage, and it was not until 1995 that Neves examined the skull,
quickly noticed its unusual characteristics and invited other
scientists, including Dr. Joseph Powell, an anthropology professor
at the University of New Mexico, to join him in drawing up a
profile of Luzia.
</P>
<P>
   Neves bases his estimate of Luzia's age on the fact that the
skull was found in a geological strata where the age of other
organic material has been established through radiocarbon dating.
The same procedure would ordinarily have been done with Luzia, but
the specimen does not have enough collagen, the protein that gives
bone its resiliency, to allow that standard technique to be used.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sort of stuck,'' said Powell, who is also curator of
human osteology at the Maxwell Museum. ``We know that she is so old
that most of the organic portion of the bone has leached out. It
would have been great to have the radiocarbon dating, but that is
not going to happen unless techniques improve dramatically, which
they may.''
</P>
<P>
   With that avenue of verification closed, Neves is making other
efforts to determine the racial and other characteristics of Luzia.
Early this year, a computerized image of Luzia's skull was sent to
Richard Neave, a forensic specialist on the faculty of medicine at
the University of Manchester in England, with a request that he
reconstruct her face.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in much better shape than many other forensic subjects
we have had to do,'' Neave said in a telephone interview. What he
ended up with when he finished was a face ``with the features one
associates with Negroid skulls, particularly the nose'' and jaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you do this sort of work, it is very important to have no
preconceived ideas,'' Neave said. ``I personally would stick my
neck out and say it is conclusive support for his findings and
demonstrates without any doubt at all'' that Luzia is of
non-Mongoloid origins.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When her remains were discovered, Luzia was alone. But more than
40 other skeletons that appear to be from the same general period
have been found in a nearby area called Lagoa Santa, and scientists
in Brazil hope to be able to test Neves' theory by doing
radiocarbon dating on at least some of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a large number of skeletons at this site, some of
them in better condition than that of Luzia,'' Prous said. ``There
is a great density of skeletons there, buried in an organized
fashion, and so we conclude this was a cemetery for them, perhaps
the oldest in the Americas.''
</P>
<P>
   Initial indications are that these skeletons indeed have many of
the same facial features and other characteristics that first made
Luzia stand out. ``We see this pattern with other skeletons of the
same age'' from the Lagoa Santa site, Powell said. ``We have seen
37 of them now, and they all have this sort of unusual
appearance.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to test the theory that Luzia belonged to a people
ethnically distinct from the ancestors of modern North and South
American Indians, scientists have also begun DNA sequencing in the
Lagoa Santa skeletons. Dr. Sergio Pena, a geneticist at the federal
University of Minas Gerais, is conducting one set of tests while
other samples have been sent to the Max Planck Anthropological
Institute in Germany, where the DNA of Neanderthal Man was isolated
in 1997, for examination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that today's Amerindians have four main groups,'' said
Pena, who found a genetic marker common to 17 different widely
dispersed Indian groups across the Americas in the course of an
earlier project. ``What would constitute molecular proof of
Walter's hypothesis is to find DNA sequences completely different
from those four groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Meltzer said: ``This is clearly the way to resolve the issue.
The skull is intriguing morphological evidence, but in order to
really nail down this issue of affinity, you need evidence, and DNA
is the way to go.''

CELL PHONES: QUESTIONS BUT NO ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(js) 
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Almost since there have been cellular phones, there
have been worries that the radio waves they emit might cause brain
cancer. Yet despite years of studies, no one has established a
solid link, and the industry has long sought to reassure the public
that the technology is perfectly safe.
</P>
<P>
   But as the little phones become ubiquitous, the questions
persist. News reports suggesting that their microwave radio
emissions may be harmful are raising the issue anew among
consumers. And public health authorities and other experts say a
few recent studies signal the need for more research to resolve an
issue that affects hundreds of millions of users worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The available science does not allow us to conclude that
mobile phones are absolutely safe, or that they are unsafe,'' the
federal Food and Drug Administration, which regulates devices that
emit radiation, said in a statement last week. It emphasized,
however, that the available evidence ``does not demonstrate any
adverse health effects associated with the use of mobile phones.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say they hope a worldwide research effort, including
studies under way in the United States, Europe, Australia and
elsewhere, will resolve the matter.
</P>
<P>
   One program that did not, despite six years of study and $27
million in spending, was just completed by Wireless Technology
Research, an independent research group in Washington under the
sponsorship of the wireless phone industry's trade association.
This project supported studies by private research organizations
and universities, and while it generally found little to link
cellular phone use and cancer, some of the research suggested
possible correlations that federal health officials said should be
clarified with further study.
</P>
<P>
   And the director of the project, Dr. George L. Carlo, put those
concerns more strongly, saying, ``The industry should stop saying
cell phones are safe without qualification when there is no proof
they are and give consumers all the information so they can make
intelligent choices.''
</P>
<P>
   The FDA announced last week that it had signed a letter of
intent with the cellular industry association to look into a
possible collaborative project to follow up on clues from the
earlier program. ``We want to see if researchers can replicate and
explain some findings from work previously done by Wireless
Technology Research,'' said Sharon Snider, an FDA spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said these findings needed further attention:
</P>
<P>
   _ A hospital study that compared brain cancer patients and a
similar group without brain cancer found no statistically
significant association between cell-phone use and a group of brain
cancers known as glioma. But when 20 types of glioma were
considered separately, an association was found between phone use
and one rare form. Puzzlingly, however, this risk appeared to
decrease rather than increase with greater mobile phone use.
</P>
<P>
   _ When a variety of cultured animal cells were exposed to
radiation from cell phones to see if it caused cancer-inducing
genetic damage, only one test battery, known as a micronucleus
assay, produced a negative result on one type of human white blood
cells. But these changes were seen only after 24 hours of microwave
exposure, raising the possibility that the damage stemmed from
heating and not direct radiation exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have assailed the industry and government
regulators for continuing to say the phones appear safe while
awaiting further studies. They say health authorities and the
industry should do more to warn consumers of the dangers and limit
exposure to the suspect radio signals.
</P>
<P>
   These critics have acquired a new ally from an unexpected
quarter _ Carlo, who heads the group that carried out the
industry-sponsored research program.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer with a Ph.D. in pathology, Carlo says the industry is
wrong in assuring the public that cell phones are safe and that no
immediate action is necessary. Research results produced through
his group and by others, although not conclusive, raise enough
alarms to advise consumers to distance themselves from cell phones,
he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to wait for absolute proof of a hazard before
taking action,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers, he said, can limit their exposure to radio emissions
from phone antennas in the following ways: using small, wired
headsets with built-in microphones to keep the phones a safe
distance away; fully extending the antenna to keep it as far away
as possible; holding the antenna at least 2 inches from the head,
the distance radiation would normally penetrate into the brain;
limiting the length of calls, and not allowing children to use the
phones, since their lower skull density allows greater radio
infusion.
</P>
<P>
   Carlo, whose research group goes out of business in December
when its mandate ends, said he broke with the industry stance when
it did not agree to his suggestion to sponsor an extensive
after-marketing research program to continually gather data on
possible adverse effects from cell phones. He accused the industry
of trying to narrow the focus of research and to ``manage'' adverse
information to protect sales.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Carlo sent letters to 30 companies in the
cellular industry, saying that adverse effects had been found in a
number of studies and that he was ``extremely frustrated and
concerned that appropriate steps have not been taken by the
wireless industry to protect consumers during this time of
uncertainty about safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlo asked for the companies' help in publishing a consumer
information package based on the findings, to be marketed by a
company with which he is affiliated. He said in an interview that
he simply wanted to produce consumer material that the industry
would not.
</P>
<P>
   JoAnne Basile, a vice president with the cellular association
who worked with Carlo, says her group does not fully understand his
change of heart or his criticism. Results of the research group's
studies have been summarized orally at meetings by Carlo and some
material has been presented to the FDA, she said, but none of the
work has yet to be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals
so other scientists can review it and comment. Ms. Basile
questioned how such results could be used to fashion policies or
recommendations when they have not been scrutinized by scientists
at large.
</P>
<P>
   ``This group was set up so that it would be independent and the
industry would have no control over it or the research results,''
she said, ``The research belongs to the researchers, and it's up to
them to publish it.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   A tranquil weather pattern will continue across much of the
country as several sprawling areas of high pressure cover much of
the nation. Only along the Canadian border will there be any major
areas of unsettled weather.
</P>
<P>
   A low pressure system and its attendant cold front will cross
the Northeast Tuesday. Ahead of the front, there will likely be a
few showers in the Adirondacks and Green Mountains. Along the
Northeast Seaboard, there will be a mixture of sunshine and clouds
while breezes freshen out of the southwest. It will also turn
milder. Meanwhile, behind the front in the northern Great Lakes,
there will be low clouds and isolated showers as cool air flows
over the warm lake waters.
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine will be abundant from central Texas to northern Florida
and northward into the Ohio Valley as a large area of high pressure
settles into the region. Afternoon readings will warm into the 70s
in many locations following another chilly morning. There will be a
few showers and an isolated rumble of thunder in southern Florida
during the afternoon, though most locations will remain dry.
</P>
<P>
   A cold front sweeping across the northern Rockies will drag some
showers and clouds into central Oregon and Idaho. Most of the
Rockies will be rain-free. Farther south, the Great Plains will
turn unseasonably warm with many readings well into the 80s. In the
Southwest, a few high clouds will spread from southern Arizona
towards western Texas. California will stay mainly sunny and warm,
though patches of clouds will cover the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Frosty Florida
</P>
<P>
   The mercury reached freezing at Tallahassee Monday, a week shy
of the earliest occurrence on record in the Florida capital. The
record minimum was also only two degrees off the lowest reading in
October. Normally, the first freeze occurs on November 25 and some
years have not seen freezing temperatures until January. Oddly,
Boston, New York and Washington have not yet reported readings
below 35 degrees. The airport at Tallahassee has a micro climate
with freezes occurring 36 times in a typical winter, but the
downtown district only notes such chill about half as often.

`TIME OF YOUR LIFE' CLOCKS IN. BUT WAIT A SECOND...
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We've been witness to the money-back guarantee of Jennifer Love
Hewitt's stardom for so long now, her new drama Time of Your Life
should actually read Finally, a Time for My Life.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you who were smitten by Hewitt a few seasons back,
when she was introduced as the pouty, cute-as-a-koala love interest
of Bailey (Scott Wolf) on Party of Five, this is a triumphant
moment. It's as though we're taking this coast-to-coast ride with
her, sharing her highs and lows, sobbing with her each and every
sniff-sniff step of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Anyhow, as the carrier of doom _ as one e-mailer so
affectionately addressed me the other day _ let me just say that
you may want to reassess your trip to Time of Your Life.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt's Sarah did her own reassessing at the end of Monday
night's opening episode, wondering whether she should stay in New
York or head back to San Francisco. She gives this sobbing,
convoluted, melodramatic speech about spontaneity and identity,
freedom and risk-taking _ if I didn't know any better, I'd figure
writer/producer team Amy Lippman and Christopher Keyser were
restaging Keri Russell's should-I-stay-or-should-I-go epiphany from
the Felicity pilot.
</P>
<P>
   I can already hear the comparisons between these two series _
and I gotta say, they're striking, all the way down to Sarah's
well-intentioned but near-obsessive reasons for being in New York
with no job and no place to live.
</P>
<P>
   But Lippman and Keyser haven't ripped off Felicity. They've
ripped off themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Time of Your Life is their Significant Others with a
built-in audience.
</P>
<P>
   Significant Others, introduced at midseason in 1998, was a
whiny, blathering series about recent college graduates navigating
life's land mines. It lasted no more than a half-dozen episodes,
and Lippman and Keyser went back to the drawing board.
</P>
<P>
   When Fox started sniffing around the ``P05'' cast for spinoff
possibilities _ Neve Campbell was also sized up, but couldn't
easily be torn away from the family _ a show centered on Hewitt
made the best business sense.
</P>
<P>
   But the pilot Keyser and Lippman submitted to Fox, a melancholy
hour about a young girl in search of her birth father, was quickly
shot down after it was established that Time of Your Life would
lead into the zanier Ally McBeal. This is the downside of
programming by demographics.
</P>
<P>
   Lippman and Keyser are a talented writing team. They know how to
find the emotional buttons in the most rudimentary of scenes. But
bridging light-hearted and hardcore drama has never been their
forte.
</P>
<P>
   That the new Time of Your Life was pieced together quickly might
have resulted in Monday night's episode, which is, to put it
mildly, clunky and messy, as though no one could decide which
direction to take.
</P>
<P>
   Even Sarah seems odd. Hewitt plays her as something of a
clueless ditz, a motormouth who can't shut up. (But at least she's
like Ally, right?) You'd think it would take more than a new time
zone to turn her brain to mush.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday night's episode, Sarah loss her luggage, found an
apartment and met the friends who will become the show's regulars.
She spent most of the episode tracking down the man she thinks is
her father, and the other half trying to decide whether she should
attempt to make it work in big, bad New York. Duh _ as if we don't
know what the decision will be.
</P>
<P>
   To get back to the Significant Others comparison: Time of Your
Life is going for the same gritty, underground New York look,
showing a place inhabited by misfits. Romy (Jennifer Garner),
playing the struggling actress Sarah befriends, actually WAS on
Significant Others. Maguire (Johnathon Schaech) sports the same
type goatee as one of that show's leading characters.
</P>
<P>
   What's most grating about Time of Your Life, though, is the
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Says Sarah, looking into the bedroom of the apartment where her
birth mother once lived: ``Maybe that's where they made me!''
</P>
<P>
   On finding her birth father: ``I came 3,000 miles and I'm just
as far away from finding him as I ever was.''
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about first episodes is that there are seconds
and thirds and maybe even fourths.
</P>
<P>
   Time of Your Life could get better, or go the way of Significant
Others. Six episodes and out. Or something like that.

   The beautiful swirls, tracery and arabesques gracing a
collection of radar pictures of Antarctica made public last week
would be worthy of exhibition by a gallery of abstract art.
</P>
<P>
   But more important, they contain clues collected by a
Canadian-American satellite that are expected to help in
forecasting the fate of low-lying parts of the world, including
Bangladesh, the Netherlands and even New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists are keenly interested in Antarctica because of
the possibility that some of its gigantic ice cap, which contains
about 90 percent of the world's ice, could slide into the sea. If
just part of the ice cap _ the West Antarctic Ice Sheet _ should do
this, the global sea level would swiftly rise by about 17 feet,
inundating coastal regions everywhere with catastrophic
consequences for humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, new images from the Canadian-American satellite
reveal a mechanism at work in the ice streams of the vastly larger
East Antarctic Ice Sheet that might allow it to slide rapidly into
the ocean, with potentially serious consequences for mankind.
</P>
<P>
   Glaciologists do not expect a catastrophe any time soon, nor are
they even sure whether Antarctica as a whole is shedding ice at a
dangerous rate. But there is evidence that the planet's atmosphere
is warming, and that global warming is causing the retreat of
glaciers. There is also evidence that the earth has undergone large
temperature changes in the past, some of them very abrupt, within a
few dozen or a few hundred years.
</P>
<P>
   Rapid global warming, scientists surmise, could have a dramatic
effect on the planet's ice caps, especially the one covering
Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   Antarctica has been frequently photographed from satellites and
aircraft, but in visible light the continent is a largely
featureless expanse of glaring white snow covering a thick layer of
ice.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, radar can penetrate clouds and the snow-covered ice
surface to reveal subtle contours and shapes that are otherwise
invisible.
</P>
<P>
   The radar pictures generated from data sent to earth by the
Canadian-built Radarsat satellite, which can discern objects only a
few meters in size, mark the first time that the entire continent
has been imaged in fine enough detail to reveal even buried tracks
left by snow tractors four decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never before have we had a holistic view of the entire
continent,'' said Dr. Ghassem Asrar, associate administrator for
earth sciences at the Washington headquarters of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration. ``Radarsat and other new
satellites are opening a new window on Antarctica.''
</P>
<P>
   The most important discoveries yielded by Radarsat, project
officials and scientists say, concern Antarctica's network of ice
streams _ immense rivers of ice that channel their way through
surrounding ice and rock like toothpaste squeezed from a tube. The
new satellite data reveals that these streams travel enormous
distances at speeds up to 3,000 feet per year _ 100 times faster
than the flow of surrounding ice.
</P>
<P>
   One network of ice streams that drains the West Antarctic Ice
Sheet (due south of South America) carries 19 cubic miles of ice
into the sea every year, data from Radarsat showed; this is
equivalent to burying Washington, D.C., under 1,700 feet of ice
every year.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kenneth C. Jezek, a glaciologist at the Byrd Polar Research
Center of Ohio State University, a lead scientist on the Radarsat
project, said his group counted about 30 ice streams in the new
pictures of the Antarctic continent, many of them previously
unknown. Radarsat was able to image these streams by recording
their effects on the surface of ice above them _ crevasses, shear
bands and other features. Even rocky hills and protuberances lying
under a two-mile thickness of ice left subtle traces on the surface
ice, which were imaged by Radarsat.
</P>
<P>
   Among the hidden features imaged by the Radarsat pictures was
Lake Vostok _ a liquid-water lake, 140 miles long and 30 miles
wide, that lies under the East Antarctic Ice Sheet. The smoothness
of the lake's surface is mirrored by a corresponding smoothness of
the surface ice two miles above it. Scientists believe that the
lake has been sealed off from the outer world for a million years
and may contain organisms very different from any found elsewhere.
But before punching a drill through the ice into the lake,
scientists are seeking a sure way of preventing contaminants from
entering the lake along with the drill.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest surprises,'' Jezek said in an interview,
``was that ice streams flowing through the East Antarctic ice sheet
extend for great distances into the very center of the continent _
in some cases, more than 500 miles from the coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means that East Antarctica, like West Antarctica, seems
to have a mechanism for rapidly moving ice from the interior to the
coastal sea.''
</P>
<P>
   This is potentially bad news. Previously, scientists had
believed that the East Antarctic Ice Sheet was locked into place
atop the continent's bed rock, incapable of rapid shifts of ice
toward the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Antarctica's ice streams are believed to be propelled by two
mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of West Antarctica, the dominant mechanism is
thought to be the removal of frictional stress by lubrication of
the ice sliding seaward over bed rock. Geothermal and volcanic
heating as well as atmospheric warming apparently maintain a layer
of liquid water and mud between the ice sheet and underlying rock,
allowing the ice to slide fairly freely.
</P>
<P>
   The other mechanism, which may be important for the transport of
ice from East Antarctica, is ``glaciological static head pressure''
_ pressure exerted by the steeply sloping two-mile thickness of ice
covering East Antarctica. Evenly distributed over the region this
pressure would cause only slow movement, but if ice is being
channeled into fast streams, as now appears to be the case, the
transport of ice could be much more rapid, Jezek said.
</P>
<P>
   But the behavior of ice streams and the coastal ice shelves into
which they flow is complex and unpredictable. The Fimbul Ice Shelf
(along the Princess Martha Coast) is retreating in some places and
advancing in others, Jezek said. The Fimbul Ice Shelf interests
glaciologists because it is at about the same latitude as ice
shelves along the Antarctic Peninsula, which are clearly
retreating. Because the Fimbul shows no such trend, the waxing and
waning of glaciers seems to depend on other factors besides
latitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are mixed signals almost everywhere you turn, with
little consistent pattern. That's why it's important to measure ice
movement in many different places at different times, to gauge
overall effects,'' Jezek said.
</P>
<P>
   Planning for Radarsat began in 1980 and took many years to reach
fruition. Canada was interested in building a high-resolution radar
satellite mainly to monitor shipping channels in the high Arctic.
</P>
<P>
   After years of negotiation between NASA and the Canadian Space
Agency, NASA agreed to launch the satellite and provide software
and data analysis in exchange for access to some of the data
produced by the satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Also, American officials insisted that the satellite make at
least two imaging scans of Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on Nov. 4, 1995, Radarsat was launched from Vandenberg
Air Force Base, in California, into a polar orbit 500 miles high,
and began scanning the earth. But it was not until 1997 that
Canadian controllers completed a difficult rotation of the
satellite putting Antarctica into full view. Then, during 18 days
in September and October of that year, Radarsat carried out its
monumental scan of the white continent.
</P>
<P>
   But acquisition of the data gathered by Radarsat took time, and
the Vexel Corporation of Boulder, Colo., needed time to develop the
software needed to generate a mosaic of the entire continent from
many small images made from different angles and orientations of
the satellite.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Some of the spectacular pictures extracted from data processed
during the last two years by the Byrd Polar Research Center _ the
fruits of the $600 million Radarsat project _ were released last
week by NASA and the Canadian Space Agency.
</P>
<P>
   One of the techniques used to determine the speeds and
directions of ice flow was interferometry, in which separate images
of the same subject were made by Radarsat on two different dates:
Sept. 24 and Oct. 18, 1997. By comparing the two views
mathematically, a computer program calculated the velocity and
direction of ice streams at every point in their courses through
surrounding ice.
</P>
<P>
   `It's this kind of fine detail we need to estimate overall
changes in the ice mass of the continent and to be able to make
predictions,'' Asrar of NASA said. ``We've made a start.''

YOUNG CHINESE-AMERICANS DISCOVER THEIR ROOTS IN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREA WOO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Jason Lew had visited his mother's old house in
China once, when he was 6, and remembers feeling out of place
within its small concrete rooms. But when he entered that same
house in July, something hit him.
</P>
<P>
   Touching the cold walls of the house, Lew cried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the sensation of coming home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lew, 17, is one of 10 Chinese-Americans reconnecting with their
families' homeland through ``In Search of Roots,'' a yearlong
program of research and study sponsored by the Chinese Culture
Center of San Francisco, the Chinese Historical Society of America
and the Overseas Chinese Affairs office in Guangdong province of
the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
   The program, aimed at those 16 and 25, was founded nine years
ago to help people understand and find their ancestral families
from the Pearl Delta region in Guangdong province, the place from
which the majority of early immigrants came in the late 19th and
early 20th centuries. Interns pay $450 to go through the program,
as well as transportation costs to and within China.
</P>
<P>
   For most of these interns _ many of whom live in the suburbs and
are second-, third- and fourth- generation Americans _ China has
been a vague foreign land, said Him Mark Lai, the program
coordinator and instructor. That perception is changing
dramatically as they read through dense immigration files,
interview elder family members here and, finally, visit the
villages of their ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've grown up as an American, even though I am
Chinese-American,'' said Lew, who attends Carlton High School in
Belmont. ``This has opened up a door to another half of me.''
</P>
<P>
   The interns began their journey at the National Archives and
Records Administration in San Bruno, where records on 250,000
immigrants are stored. There, Candace Chin, 17, a student at San
Francisco University High School, found interrogation transcripts,
photographs and personal letters from her two grandfathers, aunts
and uncles, filling three 2-inch binders before her research was
complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an emotional experience going through the files,'' Chin
said. ``You could see how harsh the government was treating
immigrants.''
</P>
<P>
   After five months of preparation and a group trip to the Angel
Island Immigration Station, where many Asians trying to enter the
United States were detained, the interns traveled to southern China
in July, accompanied by Al Cheng, the program coordinator and
translator.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese government officials arranged for four-star hotels,
meals, transportation and guides during their 15-day stay, partly
to show they still considered the interns part of the same Chinese
stock, although from overseas, said Warren Lei, 25, a real estate
agent in Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   They even offered to fix Lei's abandoned family house and sell
it back to him so he could call it home, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chin said he thought the internship program provided an economic
opportunity for China. ``They see us as a bridge between China and
the United States, and that represents growth for them and for
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   The young adults traveled together, visiting two villages a day,
stopping just two hours in each village. In her maternal ancestral
village of Lian'gangli, Chin saw the family connection between
continents when she found her aunt's American high school
graduation picture, treasured and framed in a distant cousin's
house.
</P>
<P>
   But the most touching moment for Chin was when she met a
99-year-old great-aunt she did not know she had on her paternal
side. Her great-aunt had lost touch with family in the United
States, and Chin's grandmother had assumed her sister-in-law had
died long ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's my grandfather's sister,'' said Chin, pointing to the
only picture she had left of her great-aunt, after sending most of
them back to China. ``I never got the chance to know my
grandfather, so it was a neat connection to have.''
</P>
<P>
   In the two brief hours, Chin paid respect to her past relatives
at the ancestral shrine, handed out Chinese red envelopes with
lucky money, gave Jolly Ranchers and Starbursts to the local
children, explored the village and visited her grandparents'
deserted house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized I was standing in the same spot where my family had
been and I tried to imagine their daily lives,'' Chin said. ``It
overcomes you with emotion.''

By DAVID BLOOM 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Let's play an alphabet game, shall we?
</P>
<P>
   Way back in the old days, we listened to LPs, big circles of
black vinyl that were the medium of choice for music for most of
three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Then everything changed, and fast.
</P>
<P>
   First came eight-tracks, then cassettes, then CDs in short
order. Soon after, we had DATs and MDs, and now MP3s, Liquid Audio,
a2b, Super Audio CDs, AM, FM, satellite radio, digital radio,
Internet radio, streaming media, DVD Audio discs and even more, all
fighting for next-generation dominance of how we listen to music.
</P>
<P>
   But music is far from the only place in which this acronymic
acrimony, this techno tussling has broken out.
</P>
<P>
   Movies, TV and even books are changing so quickly we can barely
keep up with the new names and formats, much less buy the new boxes
with which to play them.
</P>
<P>
   Call it format fatigue, the endless assault of new ways to
watch, store and play the media of our lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly is a question of overall consumer confusion.
People are saying, `Why do I need this?' '' acknowledged Jeff
Joseph, vice president for communications for the Consumer
Electronics Manufacturers Association. ``It's become particularly
acute for consumers familiar with the PC. And we certainly
understand and recognize those concerns as an industry.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all about forward progress, about finding faster, smaller,
more capacious, more convenient, more flexible, just plain better
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   But how much forward progress can we stand?
</P>
<P>
   `It's an interesting question,'' said Fabian Wagmister, a UCLA
professor of film and television. ``It really goes way beyond
media, to the extent of whether humans are reaching the limits of
their appetite for consumption of new gimmicky gadgets.''
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, at a certain point, how much of a difference
can we tell between Format A and slightly better Format B?
</P>
<P>
   Richard Clark, a specialist in technology in education at the
University of Southern California, is blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need it,'' Clark said. ``A lot of the more
fine-tuning of technologies isn't of benefit to most people. It's
of incredible benefit to large organizations _ but not to the
individual user.''
</P>
<P>
   And don't even start on computers and the Internet, where
changes in formats, versions and product lifespans are so rapid as
to induce nausea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, right now, if you're not really smart and know
how to install a hundred different plug-ins and know the different
formats, you can't see anything,'' said Wagmister, who founded
UCLA's HyperMedia Studio, where students explore cutting-edge ways
to immerse viewers within new media.
</P>
<P>
   And it's only getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Software product cycles, already short at 18 months to two
years, have begun to evaporate,'' writes James Gleick in ``Faster:
The Acceleration of Just About Everything.''
</P>
<P>
   As Gleick points out, companies continually update software with
patches, bug fixes and minor additions, sometimes within days of
issuing official major revisions. ``Dog years'' _ seven are about
equal to one human year _ have nothing on ``Internet time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Digital culture is perpetual innovation,'' Wagmister said.
``The only way you can make money is by creating version 2.6.1.8.
Otherwise, digital reaches a point of, `This is all I want: The
picture doesn't degrade any more, the sound is really great. What
more do I need?' And how do they make money from that?''
</P>
<P>
   More power and less cost allows us to carry around tiny digital
devices that can play music or movies, access the Internet, send
e-mail, make phone calls, track appointments and contacts or play
sophisticated games.
</P>
<P>
   But how much of this is true progress, and how much of it is a
rat's exercise wheel writ large?
</P>
<P>
   For instance, just (BEGIN ITAL)try(END ITAL) to keep your
computer software current, and on the same version as everyone with
whom you trade files. You can't do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm working on a paper with a former grad student who's about
to go to Thailand, and it's difficult to get our computers to talk
in the same language,'' said Bart Kosko, an information scientist
at USC and author of ``The Fuzzy Future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't just take what I e-mail, open it up and start
writing,'' Kosko said. ``He still gets something with all kinds of
artifacts and defects. If we didn't clean it up when it arrived, it
would literally be garbage after a little while. It's too difficult
for people to share information, even when they have the same
computers and the same software. That's an important market
failure. And it's likely to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   It once seemed as though everything was moving toward ``a more
comprehensive, do-it-all environment,'' Wagmister said.
</P>
<P>
   But a funny thing happened on the way to the techno-forum: We
were given more options than ever. And they don't always talk to
each other well. And you thought technology was going to make
things simpler?
</P>
<P>
   ``Simple? I don't think so, not for a long time,'' Wagmister
said. ``Both in the industry and in the market, there's lot of
confusion about what we want from this.''
</P>
<P>
   And that confusion leads to the Dark Side of technology and its
malcontents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be any man could make a tape,'' Wagmister said.
``But my wife can't even approach the stereo anymore. And there's
an overall fear of what to get next.''
</P>
<P>
   That fear has hamstrung some wonderful technological advances,
too, such as MiniDiscs, or MDs. Sony debuted the format six years
ago, but only this year does the company expect even 500,000 MD
players and recorders will be sold worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think MD seems to be very good format,'' Wagmister said.
``Yet it's not taking off. I think it's partially just plain
fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the Paradox of Productivity.
</P>
<P>
   The productivity of American workers has increased at a fairly
steady rate of 2 percent to 3 percent annually for years, Kosko
said. Meanwhile, the rate of investment in technology has
skyrocketed exponentially during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where did all the expenditures go?'' Kosko said. ``You could
argue that the current strong economy is a result of that
investment, though you could point to a lot of other factors as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   So what happened?
</P>
<P>
   ``One possibility is the suggestion that people trade in their
computers and upgrade software too quickly,'' Kosko said.
</P>
<P>
   New computers are astonishingly powerful, even compared to those
of a few years ago. And we can say the same of other electronic
devices that are increasingly driven by the same technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have long since outstripped the chip power we need to
write letters and send e-mail,'' Kosko said. ``You see it also with
people trading in cars far more frequently than they need to. It
suggests this is more of a lifestyle change. Could it be this
fashion thing of trying to keep up? If everybody held on to their
computer twice as long, they might get more bang for their buck.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark, something of a techno-skeptic who is writing a book about
human motivation, has an idea why we do this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Self-confidence is a big motivator,'' said Clark. ``In this
culture, control is a very big issue. People look to technology as
a boost to this personal efficacy. It gives them all kinds of
personal control.''
</P>
<P>
   That allows CEMA's Joseph to confidently proclaim: ``There will
always be markets for those who understand technology and want a
more lifelike experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph says the shift to digital formats _ turning everything
entertainment into a soup of ones and zeros _ means hope for the
future. Ultimately, a single, centralized device called a media
server will store, manage and play each home's movies, TV shows,
Internet access, music, games and more.
</P>
<P>
   The media server would be connected to speakers, monitors and
control devices throughout the house, so one person could surf the
Net, another watch a show, two others play a video game and another
order pizza and a good book.
</P>
<P>
   Companies' fears of the fallout from format fatigue have led
them to more intelligently engineer their products and create
``backward-compatible'' standards, such as for DVD, that allow new
gadgets to play old media as well as better new formats.
</P>
<P>
   But if we really wanted to ease the ache of technology's forward
leaps, Kosko said we'd call a societal timeout on new stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would increase the likelihood that standards would emerge _
and reduce problems with software by making (those standards) work
better together,'' Kosko said. ``It's like picking fruit from one
tree, leaving a lot of it on the branch as you race on to the next
one. You never get mastery of the tools. To put it into two words:
virtuosity evaporates.''
</P>
<P>
   Though we seem to have too little of it, Wagmister said the
passing of time will help ease our techno-woes, as more power
eventually translates into more ease of use, even invisibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a while to know what to do with technology,''
Wagmister said. ``It took filmmaking 20 or 30 years to become what
we know it as. And right now, we're pushing technology into the
market before we know what to do with it. As a consequence, I don't
think we'll see technology making life easier for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   We had better figure this out, though, because Kosko and others
are predicting ``heaven on a chip,'' the transfer of our brain
functions to a device of some sort that mirrors what our gray
matter does in our minds. That's the last place you want to have a
little format conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that sense, there's a scary thought about interoperability
there,'' Kosko said. ``Standards are (BEGIN ITAL)really(END ITAL)
important. But I think this will all work itself out.'' &QL;

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Let's play an alphabet game, shall we?
</P>
<P>
   Way back in the old days, we listened to LPs, big circles of
black vinyl that were the medium of choice for music for most of
three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Then everything changed, and fast.
</P>
<P>
   First came eight-tracks, then cassettes, then CDs in short
order. Soon after, we had DATs and MDs, and now MP3s, Liquid Audio,
a2b, Super Audio CDs, AM, FM, satellite radio, digital radio,
Internet radio, streaming media, DVD Audio discs and even more, all
fighting for next-generation dominance of how we listen to music.
</P>
<P>
   But music is far from the only place in which this acronymic
acrimony, this techno tussling has broken out.
</P>
<P>
   Movies, TV and even books are changing so quickly we can barely
keep up with the new names and formats, much less buy the new boxes
with which to play them.
</P>
<P>
   Call it format fatigue, the endless assault of new ways to
watch, store and play the media of our lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly is a question of overall consumer confusion.
People are saying, `Why do I need this?' '' acknowledged Jeff
Joseph, vice president for communications for the Consumer
Electronics Manufacturers Association. ``It's become particularly
acute for consumers familiar with the PC. And we certainly
understand and recognize those concerns as an industry.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all about forward progress, about finding faster, smaller,
more capacious, more convenient, more flexible, just plain better
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   But how much forward progress can we stand?
</P>
<P>
   `It's an interesting question,'' said Fabian Wagmister, a UCLA
professor of film and television. ``It really goes way beyond
media, to the extent of whether humans are reaching the limits of
their appetite for consumption of new gimmicky gadgets.''
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, at a certain point, how much of a difference
can we tell between Format A and slightly better Format B?
</P>
<P>
   Richard Clark, a specialist in technology in education at the
University of Southern California, is blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need it,'' Clark said. ``A lot of the more
fine-tuning of technologies isn't of benefit to most people. It's
of incredible benefit to large organizations _ but not to the
individual user.''
</P>
<P>
   And don't even start on computers and the Internet, where
changes in formats, versions and product lifespans are so rapid as
to induce nausea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, right now, if you're not really smart and know
how to install a hundred different plug-ins and know the different
formats, you can't see anything,'' said Wagmister, who founded
UCLA's HyperMedia Studio, where students explore cutting-edge ways
to immerse viewers within new media.
</P>
<P>
   And it's only getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Software product cycles, already short at 18 months to two
years, have begun to evaporate,'' writes James Gleick in ``Faster:
The Acceleration of Just About Everything.''
</P>
<P>
   As Gleick points out, companies continually update software with
patches, bug fixes and minor additions, sometimes within days of
issuing official major revisions. ``Dog years'' _ seven are about
equal to one human year _ have nothing on ``Internet time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Digital culture is perpetual innovation,'' Wagmister said.
``The only way you can make money is by creating version 2.6.1.8.
Otherwise, digital reaches a point of, `This is all I want: The
picture doesn't degrade any more, the sound is really great. What
more do I need?' And how do they make money from that?''
</P>
<P>
   More power and less cost allows us to carry around tiny digital
devices that can play music or movies, access the Internet, send
e-mail, make phone calls, track appointments and contacts or play
sophisticated games.
</P>
<P>
   But how much of this is true progress, and how much of it is a
rat's exercise wheel writ large?
</P>
<P>
   For instance, just (BEGIN ITAL)try(END ITAL) to keep your
computer software current, and on the same version as everyone with
whom you trade files. You can't do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm working on a paper with a former grad student who's about
to go to Thailand, and it's difficult to get our computers to talk
in the same language,'' said Bart Kosko, an information scientist
at USC and author of ``The Fuzzy Future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't just take what I e-mail, open it up and start
writing,'' Kosko said. ``He still gets something with all kinds of
artifacts and defects. If we didn't clean it up when it arrived, it
would literally be garbage after a little while. It's too difficult
for people to share information, even when they have the same
computers and the same software. That's an important market
failure. And it's likely to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   It once seemed as though everything was moving toward ``a more
comprehensive, do-it-all environment,'' Wagmister said.
</P>
<P>
   But a funny thing happened on the way to the techno-forum: We
were given more options than ever. And they don't always talk to
each other well. And you thought technology was going to make
things simpler?
</P>
<P>
   ``Simple? I don't think so, not for a long time,'' Wagmister
said. ``Both in the industry and in the market, there's lot of
confusion about what we want from this.''
</P>
<P>
   And that confusion leads to the Dark Side of technology and its
malcontents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be any man could make a tape,'' Wagmister said.
``But my wife can't even approach the stereo anymore. And there's
an overall fear of what to get next.''
</P>
<P>
   That fear has hamstrung some wonderful technological advances,
too, such as MiniDiscs, or MDs. Sony debuted the format six years
ago, but only this year does the company expect even 500,000 MD
players and recorders will be sold worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think MD seems to be very good format,'' Wagmister said.
``Yet it's not taking off. I think it's partially just plain
fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the Paradox of Productivity.
</P>
<P>
   The productivity of American workers has increased at a fairly
steady rate of 2 percent to 3 percent annually for years, Kosko
said. Meanwhile, the rate of investment in technology has
skyrocketed exponentially during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where did all the expenditures go?'' Kosko said. ``You could
argue that the current strong economy is a result of that
investment, though you could point to a lot of other factors as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   So what happened?
</P>
<P>
   ``One possibility is the suggestion that people trade in their
computers and upgrade software too quickly,'' Kosko said.
</P>
<P>
   New computers are astonishingly powerful, even compared to those
of a few years ago. And we can say the same of other electronic
devices that are increasingly driven by the same technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have long since outstripped the chip power we need to
write letters and send e-mail,'' Kosko said. ``You see it also with
people trading in cars far more frequently than they need to. It
suggests this is more of a lifestyle change. Could it be this
fashion thing of trying to keep up? If everybody held on to their
computer twice as long, they might get more bang for their buck.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark, something of a techno-skeptic who is writing a book about
human motivation, has an idea why we do this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Self-confidence is a big motivator,'' said Clark. ``In this
culture, control is a very big issue. People look to technology as
a boost to this personal efficacy. It gives them all kinds of
personal control.''
</P>
<P>
   That allows CEMA's Joseph to confidently proclaim: ``There will
always be markets for those who understand technology and want a
more lifelike experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph says the shift to digital formats _ turning everything
entertainment into a soup of ones and zeros _ means hope for the
future. Ultimately, a single, centralized device called a media
server will store, manage and play each home's movies, TV shows,
Internet access, music, games and more.
</P>
<P>
   The media server would be connected to speakers, monitors and
control devices throughout the house, so one person could surf the
Net, another watch a show, two others play a video game and another
order pizza and a good book.
</P>
<P>
   Companies' fears of the fallout from format fatigue have led
them to more intelligently engineer their products and create
``backward-compatible'' standards, such as for DVD, that allow new
gadgets to play old media as well as better new formats.
</P>
<P>
   But if we really wanted to ease the ache of technology's forward
leaps, Kosko said we'd call a societal timeout on new stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would increase the likelihood that standards would emerge _
and reduce problems with software by making (those standards) work
better together,'' Kosko said. ``It's like picking fruit from one
tree, leaving a lot of it on the branch as you race on to the next
one. You never get mastery of the tools. To put it into two words:
virtuosity evaporates.''
</P>
<P>
   Though we seem to have too little of it, Wagmister said the
passing of time will help ease our techno-woes, as more power
eventually translates into more ease of use, even invisibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a while to know what to do with technology,''
Wagmister said. ``It took filmmaking 20 or 30 years to become what
we know it as. And right now, we're pushing technology into the
market before we know what to do with it. As a consequence, I don't
think we'll see technology making life easier for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   We had better figure this out, though, because Kosko and others
are predicting ``heaven on a chip,'' the transfer of our brain
functions to a device of some sort that mirrors what our gray
matter does in our minds. That's the last place you want to have a
little format conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that sense, there's a scary thought about interoperability
there,'' Kosko said. ``Standards are (BEGIN ITAL)really(END ITAL)
important. But I think this will all work itself out.'' &QL;

HOW ABOUT MARTHA STEWART INSTEAD? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Real estate tycoon Donald Trump and right-wing
commentator Patrick Buchanan have jumped to the Reform Party,
bringing along their abundant egos and cumbersome political
baggage.
</P>
<P>
   The party deserves better. Neither one has the right stuff to
lead a third party into the White House. Or for that matter a
first, second or fourth party either.
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party's incoming chairman, Jack Gargan, predicts that
neither man will be its presidential nominee. Perhaps Gargan is a
wide-eyed optimist. Or perhaps he's just more realistic than either
Trump or Buchanan about their prospects.
</P>
<P>
   But if Gargan is correct, someone not yet mentioned will get the
party's nod and its $12.6 million kitty for the presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   We don't have to look far. There's an obvious candidate out
there the Great Mentioner has overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   This person has what the party requires _ celebrity status,
megabucks and good, nonthreatening and sensible ideas that sell
well.
</P>
<P>
   Who else but Martha Stewart?
</P>
<P>
   Don't laugh. We're talking Reform Party here, not the Democratic
or Republican parties. The Reformers are a ridiculous sideshow, a
headless horseman, without her. How could it get worse?
</P>
<P>
   And there is more to this woman than embroidering a tablecloth
or basting a turkey.
</P>
<P>
   She is every bit the savvy business mogul that Trump is. When
she took her company public last week, she wound up with a mound of
stock worth $1.2 billion (that's with a b), making her one of the
richest women in the world. Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia _ her
empire of books, magazines, mail-order products, a newspaper column
and television shows _ is a fantastic money-maker built around her
personal sense of good taste. If that's not proof of executive
leadership, what is?
</P>
<P>
   She now has enough money to compete with the big boys in the
presidential sweepstakes. Trump's biggest asset is that he is rich
enough to finance the signature-gathering process necessary to get
the Reform Party on the ballot in the states where it is not. The
party is currently on the ballot in only 20 states.
</P>
<P>
   If Stewart committed some of her fortune and masterminded the
campaign the way she masterminds the running of households, she
could easily trump Trump.
</P>
<P>
   Her obsession with perfecting the art of living well is easy to
ridicule. But she'd be right at home in the Reform Party. The
biggest joke on the political stage is that big clown, the party's
only statewide elected official, Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   At least she is kidded for striving to make things look and
taste nice, not for crude comments about everything from bras to
religion.
</P>
<P>
   As far as Buchanan goes, she can compete with him in high name
recognition, one of his biggest assets. If there's anyone who
hasn't heard of her, he (it's probably a he) must live in an
unfurnished barn.
</P>
<P>
   And she has a lot better reputation than Buchanan for tolerance
and individual dignity. To her, a lifestyle decision is the color
of the bathroom paint, not a woman's agony over whether to bear an
unwanted child.
</P>
<P>
   When she talks about ``family values,'' she means the price to a
couple of investing in a good dining room chandelier. When Buchanan
talks about ``family values,'' he means imposing authoritarian
notions of conservative, outdated traditions on ordinary voters.
</P>
<P>
   So she doesn't know much about foreign policy. Neither does
Trump. Or Texas Gov. George W. Bush, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan professes to be a foreign policy expert, but his
isolationist ideas are nutty and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   So she has never held elective political office. Neither has
Trump or Buchanan. Or Ross Perot, before his two unsuccessful tries
for the presidency on the Reform Party ticket.
</P>
<P>
   So she had an angry divorce. So, as the world knows, did Trump.
</P>
<P>
   So nobody knows where she stands on the burning issues of the
day _ education, gun control, tobacco taxes, campaign finance
reform, the nuclear test-ban treaty. So who cares? She looks and
sounds good on television.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Stewart is a perfect fit for the silly Reform Party. It
would be a good thing.

 &HT;    Why do guys love gadgets?
 &HT;    By Brian D. Crecente
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ If you're really into gadgets, you might
not want to know why _ it isn't pretty.
</P>
<P>
   According to experts, men like stuff because their fathers did,
and because when they were a kid someone probably handed them a
G.I. Joe instead of a Barbie. It's also because men like to be in
control. Oh, and don't forget that when it comes to gadgets, men
are like rats.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a study with rats that showed they have a desire for
newness, for novelty in life,'' said Allen Smith, an associate
professor of marketing at Florida Atlantic University. ``That's
been demonstrated in marketing as well.''
</P>
<P>
   No one really needs most gadgets, but they seem to have an
almost magical draw on men. Smith says that's because a product
isn't just about function.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's also an abstract need for a product,'' he said. ``The
curiosity, the novelty, having something unique.''
</P>
<P>
   But why men, and why some men and not others?
</P>
<P>
   David Georgoff, a professor of marketing at FAU, says a lot of
it has to do with how men are brought up and what the people who
brought them up were into.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of psychology involved,'' he said. ``There is
sex-typing that goes on as children that determines what you will
like when you grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   Sociologist Glenn E. Good isn't so kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are fun, they're easy to control,'' said Good, an
associate professor in the Department of Educational and Counseling
Psychology at the University of Missouri at Columbia. ``Guys like
to be in control of things, be the boss of their own little sound
system or car alarms. They have low interpersonal skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Good, past president of the Society for the Psychological Study
of Men and Masculinity, said there are deeper reasons for men's
fascination with stuff as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a controversial issue,'' he said. ``Some say it's
hard-wired into the genetics. Guys are encouraged toward gadgets
instead of relationships. And you are either into gadgets or
relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Good says most gadget purchases are spurred by hype and status.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they are staying home that day thinking, 'You
know, what I really need is a watch that is a phone.' It's the
hype, it's the status. It's a new thing to do.''

TWIRLING BIG IDEAS IN THE AIR AND SENDING THEM HOME, EFFORTLESSLY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Midori is playing, a very fine line of violin
tone _ hardly more than brushed off the string and whisper-soft _
can contain a huge, bulging quantity of musical character. She
showed this essential aspect of her artistry at once on Friday
night at Carnegie Hall, in the first movement of Mozart's A Major
Sonata (K. 526). In her quietness, clarity and balance, she
respected the Classical, domestic origins of the music, but at the
same time her phrasing projected a great strength of musical
communication through the hall.
</P>
<P>
   Though well past her days as a child prodigy, she remains a
slight figure. Music, though, has no weight. She can twirl big
ideas in the air and send them rushing home to her listeners with
tremendous force.
</P>
<P>
   John Corigliano's early sonata, which she played next, provided
opportunities for varieties of color, from the superfine high notes
she extends with perfect steadiness to something like an insistent
bark. This is also much more extroverted music than Mozart's, and
she seemed to love its bravado, its humor and its Stravinskian
agility. Happily, Corigliano was in the hall to hear her.
</P>
<P>
   After intermission came Schoenberg's Phantasy, which was
beautifully and meaningfully played both by Midori and by her
accompanist, Robert McDonald. Here the composer, near the end of
his life, seems to have been remembering the nightmare fantastical
world of his ``Pierrot Lunaire,'' and McDonald reacted
appropriately with brilliant, moonlit passages at the top of the
instrument and vivid changes of nuance. Meanwhile Midori was making
the violin part an intensely expressive declamation in different
registers, and the music was further helped on its way by the
immediacy with which the two players would come together _ or fly
apart _ at sudden moments.
</P>
<P>
   This was a remarkable performance, but so too was that of
Franck's sonata at the end. Midori made the opening melody so
gentle, so fragile, you almost did not want to hear it for fear it
would break in your ears. But music is tough as well as weightless.
For as long as the sonata went on in this vein _ and again when it
returned to similar material _ Midori kept up her fingertip
handling, and yet, as in the Mozart, her musical expression was
sure and large. There was a touching sense that much more was being
implied than could be said, that here was someone smiling through
tears _ or weeping through laughter. The ambiguity was complete,
and right.

 &HT;    10 gadgets to keep any guy happy
 &HT;    By Brian D. Crecente
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Splitting atoms? Cloning sheep? Bah! Why
waste technology pursuing knowledge when you can make the James
Bond fantasies of every warm-blooded male come true with
microchips, miniaturization and gizmos galore? We're not talking
Dick Tracy watches and pocket telescopes. We're talking techno toys
that will bathe you in virtual reality, keep you wired 24/7 and do
your laundry and sweep your floor. To help you zero in on the stuff
no one really needs but everyone would love to have, we've waded
through the gazillion gadgets in circulation today to come up with
10 that have one thing in common:
</P>
<P>
   They are so cool, they make guys drool.
</P>
<P>
   I-GLASSES
</P>
<P>
   Who needs a big-screen TV when you can wear a virtual theater on
your head? I-O Display Systems' 8-ounce i-glasses will adorn your
noggin with adjustable earphones and two 0.7-inch displays that
create the illusion of watching an 80-inch screen floating about 11
feet in front of your face. You can plug them into a television,
VCR, cable or video game console. For an extra $1,000, you can get
the Televizer package, which includes the i-glasses and a Panasonic
P-10 portable DVD player and a carrying case.
</P>
<P>
   What it costs: $499 for just the i-glasses, $1,499 for the
Televizer package.
</P>
<P>
   Where to buy it: online at www.i-glasses.com.
</P>
<P>
   Why you've gotta have it: Obviously, so you can sit in the
corner and rock yourself into a high-definition stupor while
watching an 80-inch screen no one else can see.
</P>
<P>
   WEARABLE COMPUTER
</P>
<P>
   The lights are low. Soft music is playing. Time to slip into
something a little more comfortable? Nah. Time to strap on this
awesome hunk of hardware and surf the World Wide Web all night.
</P>
<P>
   The Xybernaut wearable computer features a 233 megahertz
computer with a 4 gig hard drive and 128 megs of RAM. It lets you
send and receive live video through an eyepiece and a head-mounted
camera. It gives you full Internet access anywhere, anytime via
cell phone uplink, and allows you to type the next ``War and
Peace'' (or dictate it into a microphone) while jogging through the
park. Here's how it works: A keyboard straps to your wrist. A
battery-powered, 28-ounce computer slips onto a belt and hooks up
to a headset, which includes a miniature video camera mounted above
one eye, a tiny display contraption above the other eye, and a
microphone at your mouth. A separate wrist-mounted monitor can also
be connected to the computer, as can a cell phone and a plethora of
other goodies.
</P>
<P>
   What it costs: From $5,000 to $10,000, depending on what bells
and whistles you get.
</P>
<P>
   Where to buy it: www.xybernaut.com, or wait a year, when a
lighter, better and cheaper version is expected to be released to
stores.
</P>
<P>
   Why you've gotta have it: Cut the grass and defragment your hard
drive at the same time! Dash to the fridge without putting the game
on pause! Best of all: It's not just a computer, it's a fashion
statement. INTERNET WATCH
</P>
<P>
   New kind of watch? Yawn. New way of telling time? Now you've got
our attention.
</P>
<P>
   Swatch has invented Internet time. It took the standard 24-hour
day and divided it into 1,000 beats. Each beat is equivalent to 1
minute and 26.4 seconds, with the meridian in Biel, Switzerland,
world headquarters of Swatch. So when you're wearing the Swatch
Beat watch, the Internet day begins (at)000, or midnight Biel Mean
Time, and runs through 999. That means no more time-zone trauma:
When you and Aussiegal agree to a Diablo deathmatch (at)539, you'll
both know exactly what time to show up.
</P>
<P>
   The Swatch Beat also allows you to protect your e-mail downloads
using a microchip embedded in the watch and a special mousepad.
When the watch comes in contact with the mousepad, the computer
automatically downloads your e-mail. If your chip doesn't match-up,
then no e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   What it costs: The standard Swatch Beat watch costs $70 and the
Swatch Access Beat Watch (with mousepad) is expected to cost $160.
</P>
<P>
   Where to buy it: Most upscale watch stores, but the Swatch
Access Beat Watch isn't expected until the end of the year. Check
www.swatch.com for more info.
</P>
<P>
   Why you've gotta have it: No cyber-junkie should do without this
cool little timepiece, which also happens to feature a fixed
countdown to the Year 2K. Once the year 2000 hits, you can
reprogram the timer to countdown to whatever you want, assuming we
are all still here ...
</P>
<P>
   SEGA DREAMCAST
</P>
<P>
   The battle between video game consoles and computers has been
tooth-and-nail, but Sega's Dreamcast ends all that by combining the
two. The bulky little game console comes with artificial
intelligence, a 56k modem and Web browsing software so you can play
a game on the Net with your buddy or use it to send and receive
e-mail. Before you know it, the Dreamcast will be doing what it
does best: Sucking away your will to socialize, until life becomes
a blur of mind-numbing eye-candy and booming digital sound.
</P>
<P>
   What it costs: $199.99
</P>
<P>
   Where to buy it: Go to any toy or electronic story and wait for
the next shipment to come in.
</P>
<P>
   Why you've gotta have it: It, um, stimulates right-brain
activity and helps develop eye-hand coordination. (It also happens
to be the slickest, fastest, most intelligent gaming system to see
the light of day. Who needs a computer?)
</P>
<P>
   HAL2000
</P>
<P>
   Kick back and boss your house around with the latest in
automated living systems from Home Automated Living. The HAL2000
uses voice recognition and your home's existing wiring to control
the thermostat, lighting, electrical appliances and security
system. The system keeps track of to-do lists and appointments, and
will even hop on the Internet to answer your questions. Don't
bother with the Weather Channel, just ask your house if it's gonna
rain! HAL uses your Internet connection to hook-up and retrieve TV
listings, e-mail, stock information, news, sports and traffic
reports. You talk to Hal through a microphone connected to its
computer, or by picking up any phone in the house. You can also
call in while you're away and tell your house what to do. Just
don't try to unplug HAL once it's up and running. I'm afraid that's
something I cannot allow to happen.
</P>
<P>
   What it costs: The basic HAL2000 unit costs $389. Add-ons run
from $8 to $249.
</P>
<P>
   Where to buy it: Online at www.automatedliving.com.
</P>
<P>
   Why you've gotta have it: Think of the money you'll save having
HAL around to turn off the hall light. (For a gadget geek, it
doesn't get any better than a talking house that does your
bidding.)
</P>
<P>
   PERSONAL ROBOT
</P>
<P>
   George Jetson had one, why not you? This 5-inch-tall,
16-inch-wide midget machine named Cye, will vacuum your floors,
deliver the mail and act like a robotic pup. The wheeled tyke from
Probotics Inc., resembles a dustpan and is controlled by your PC
via a wireless link. You can use your mouse to guide the bot
through the house, or let it explore on its own. A point-and-click
map shows you where the robot is and what areas have been explored.
You can also program it for automatic tasks, like vacuuming the
house when the in-laws are coming over for dinner. So what if it
can't mix a martini or swing its arms about wildly and shout
``Danger Will Robinson!'' (it doesn't even have arms). You'll still
have the niftiest robot on your block.
</P>
<P>
   What it costs: $695; a vacuum attachment or wagon will run you
an additional $89 each.
</P>
<P>
   Where to buy it: It's available at www.personalrobots.com now,
but not yet in stores.
</P>
<P>
   Why you've gotta have it: Not only will this puppy take the
drudgery out of those daily household chores, it'll take the
drudgery out of your life by letting you chase the cat, close and
open every door in the house over and over again, and four-wheel up
that couch you just bought.
</P>
<P>
   WATCH PHONE
</P>
<P>
   Keeping time has been so overdone, what's a poor watch to do?
Become a cell phone, of course. The SwatchTalk looks like a normal
wristwatch, but 12 inconspicuous buttons around its outer edge and
a hidden microphone and speaker turn it into a watch that would
make Maxwell Smart jealous. A digital display lets you see what
number you're calling, and a ring lets you know when it's time to
answer your watch. Swatch promises that the speakers and microphone
are loud enough to be used without taking the watch off your wrist.
SwatchTalk comes with a charger that will give your watch enough
power to last a ``reasonable'' day.
</P>
<P>
   What it costs: Will list for about $350.
</P>
<P>
   Where to buy it: You can't. Swatch is working on extending the
battery life and making it compatible with mobile phone standards
in the U.S. and elsewhere. Look for it in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Why you've gotta have it: The convenience of cellular technology
without the inconvenience of keeping track of a cell phone.
Besides, now you'll be able to talk into your watch and, this time,
someone will be able to hear you on the other end. Dick Tracy out!
</P>
<P>
   TWO-WAY DIGITAL CAMERA RADIO
</P>
<P>
   Whatever kick-started our fascination with two-way radios as
kids, it sunk its hooks in deep. Even in adulthood, most of us
can't walk past a Radio Shack without peering through the window,
trying to catch a glimpse of a walkie talkie. Now there's something
new for clunky transceivers: video. The folks at Kenwood have come
up with a digital camera you can pop onto most major two-ways and
use to capture, store and display up to nine pictures and then
transmit them to another similarly equipped rig in about 30 seconds
over the air.
</P>
<P>
   What it costs: The KVT-10 costs $835; check www.kenwood.net for
info.
</P>
<P>
   Where to buy it: Most electronics stores.
</P>
<P>
   Why you've gotta have it: Boss doesn't believe your car broke
down? Send him a picture of your smoldering hood, and don't forget
to add a smile and thumbs up to your 10-4 good buddy.
</P>
<P>
   THE VISOR
</P>
<P>
   I know, I know, only guys in three-piece suits buy palmtop
computers like the Palm Pilot. I mean who wants to sit there with
their tongue half-stuck out for 15 minutes trying to spell some
corporate contact's name with a plastic stylus and Pilot-letters
when you can just grab a pen and jot it down on the palm of your
hand? But what if you could get a palmtop in a bunch of cool colors
and, when your boss isn't looking, pop in a game cartridge or
digital music player? Now you're talking useful. And who needs the
12,000 addresses, 10 years of appointments and 400 e-mail messages
the Visor holds when you also can use the thing as a universal
remote or pager? Now that's cool.
</P>
<P>
   What it costs: $149 to $249. Expansion modules run from $29 to
$129.
</P>
<P>
   Where to buy it: Online at www.handspring.com; coming to stores
by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Why you've gotta have it: Here's just a few things you can turn
this palmtop into using the expansion slot: pager, virtual map,
reference library, modem, mp3 player, keyboard, voice recorder,
dictionary, universal remote, digital camera. And it still fits in
your shirt pocket.
</P>
<P>
   PORTABLE DVD PLAYER
</P>
<P>
   Imagine being able to carry around a high-definition film fest
in your briefcase. Suddenly, long waits become a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   A few companies are working on the portable DVD player, but
Panasonic was the first to bring it to the store. At just under 2
pounds, the PalmTheater opens up like a clam shell to reveal a
5.8-inch monitor and two built-in speakers. The paperback-sized
player can show three hours of movies on one battery charge in
either standard or wide-screen modes. Even better: You can plug the
player into your television at home and use it like a standard DVD
player.
</P>
<P>
   What it costs: $1099.95; check www.panasonic.com for more info.
</P>
<P>
   Where to buy it: Most electronics stores.
</P>
<P>
   Why you've gotta have it: You, reclined on the couch, bag of
chips near one hand, bottle of beer near other, a mini-movie
theater propped on your belly playing a high-definition version of
``Armageddon.'' Need we say more?

 &HT;    Why do guys love gadgets?
 &HT;    By Brian D. Crecente
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ If you're really into gadgets, you might
not want to know why _ it isn't pretty.
</P>
<P>
   According to experts, men like stuff because their fathers did,
and because when they were a kid someone probably handed them a
G.I. Joe instead of a Barbie. It's also because men like to be in
control. Oh, and don't forget that when it comes to gadgets, men
are like rats.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a study with rats that showed they have a desire for
newness, for novelty in life,'' said Allen Smith, an associate
professor of marketing at Florida Atlantic University. ``That's
been demonstrated in marketing as well.''
</P>
<P>
   No one really needs most gadgets, but they seem to have an
almost magical draw on men. Smith says that's because a product
isn't just about function.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's also an abstract need for a product,'' he said. ``The
curiosity, the novelty, having something unique.''
</P>
<P>
   But why men, and why some men and not others?
</P>
<P>
   David Georgoff, a professor of marketing at FAU, says a lot of
it has to do with how men are brought up and what the people who
brought them up were into.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of psychology involved,'' he said. ``There is
sex-typing that goes on as children that determines what you will
like when you grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   Sociologist Glenn E. Good isn't so kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are fun, they're easy to control,'' said Good, an
associate professor in the Department of Educational and Counseling
Psychology at the University of Missouri at Columbia. ``Guys like
to be in control of things, be the boss of their own little sound
system or car alarms. They have low interpersonal skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Good, past president of the Society for the Psychological Study
of Men and Masculinity, said there are deeper reasons for men's
fascination with stuff as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a controversial issue,'' he said. ``Some say it's
hard-wired into the genetics. Guys are encouraged toward gadgets
instead of relationships. And you are either into gadgets or
relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Good says most gadget purchases are spurred by hype and status.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they are staying home that day thinking, 'You
know, what I really need is a watch that is a phone.' It's the
hype, it's the status. It's a new thing to do.''

   It was George W. Bush's first big decision as owner of the Texas
Rangers, a call that might alter the franchise and perhaps his
political future.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, a year after his group bought the team, Bush was
pondering plans for a new baseball stadium. One of his partners
suggested that the team look outside of Arlington and hold an
auction among local cities, a tactic often used by sports owners to
wrest expensive concessions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush argued against it. Since gaining control of the Rangers, he
had told Arlington leaders that their city would get first crack at
a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said it wasn't right to hold a gun to anybody's head,''
said Tom Schieffer, a partner who would lead the Rangers' efforts
to build the new park. ``He was very good at building a consensus,
and that decision has George's fingerprints all over it.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy worked, financially and politically. Arlington
voters approved a sales tax increase for a new stadium, the value
of the franchise soared, and Bush avoided the political fallout of
a bitter bidding war among North Texas cities.
</P>
<P>
   The building of The Ballpark in Arlington was Bush's biggest
victory in business, turning around what had been an unimpressive
career in the oil industry. Seven months after The Ballpark opened
in 1994, Bush won the Texas governor's race, and last year he
became a multimillionaire when the team was sold.
</P>
<P>
   The events surrounding The Ballpark are worth recounting because
they tell much about the man who would be president. Even as a
businessman, Bush's strength was in politics.
</P>
<P>
   From his lesser-known struggles in the oil patch to his
high-profile years with the Rangers, Bush made his impact by
connecting with people, associates say. Rather than riding to the
top by specializing in high finance or by reshaping an industry,
Bush scored by courting investors, striking deals and handling the
public side of his enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, he benefited from the help of powerful allies and
the connections of his influential family.
</P>
<P>
   As the first son of a president, the grandson of a U.S. senator
and a graduate of Yale University and Harvard Business School, Bush
is part of a far-reaching business and social network that has
helped him throughout his life. From an uncle on Wall Street who
raised money for his oil patch start-up to family ties that helped
with his purchase of the Rangers, personal contacts provided
crucial help in Bush's business career.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, some of those same people are now raising
money for his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like the door of opportunity was always open for a
guy named Bush,'' said Ed Martin, a Democratic Party consultant who
worked for Gov. Ann Richards in her failed 1994 re-election
campaign against Bush. ``Most people realize that this happens
every day in America's corporate culture. But he's not living the
life that most of us are.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who is 53, readily acknowledges that he has had
advantages. As important, he says, is that he made the most of
those chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident there have been a lot of first-born sons who
have had famous names who have been miserable failures in life,''
Bush said in an interview with the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.
</P>
<P>
   His results in the business world were mixed. During a decade as
an oilman, from the mid-'70s to the mid-'80s, Bush lost millions of
investors' dollars before reversing his fortunes in baseball.
Still, as he campaigns for the White House, he can claim that he
met a payroll in two industries, weathered tough times in business
and produced a winning bottom line with the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question,'' said Cal Jillson, a political analyst at
Southern Methodist University in Dallas, ``is how much of George W.
Bush's success is due to his individual effort and how much is due
to the network from which he comes?''
</P>
<P>
   Business colleagues say that Bush worked for what he got,
describing him as an active executive who went to the office every
day and participated in key decisions.
</P>
<P>
   As an oilman, he raised money and built a company from zero to
15 employees. In Midland, he was seen as a hands-on operator who
could be trusted to drill wells for out-of-town investors.
</P>
<P>
   As a baseball owner, he was the public face of an organization
in the news every day and represented the Rangers at Major League
Baseball meetings. He worked closely with Richard Greene, who was
then Arlington mayor, and Schieffer to win voter support for a
sales tax increase to build The Ballpark. Behind the scenes, he led
quarterly meetings and maintained harmony among a group of 30
limited partners.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders may not have realized his impact, Schieffer says,
because Bush delegated authority and rarely second-guessed his
employees. But he says that should not diminish Bush's achievement:
He headed a sports franchise during controversial times and emerged
as a popular figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of sports owners,'' Schieffer said, ``who
couldn't get elected dog catcher.''

 &HT;    10 gadgets to keep any guy happy
 &HT;    By Brian D. Crecente
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Splitting atoms? Cloning sheep? Bah! Why
waste technology pursuing knowledge when you can make the James
Bond fantasies of every warm-blooded male come true with
microchips, miniaturization and gizmos galore? We're not talking
Dick Tracy watches and pocket telescopes. We're talking techno toys
that will bathe you in virtual reality, keep you wired 24/7 and do
your laundry and sweep your floor. To help you zero in on the stuff
no one really needs but everyone would love to have, we've waded
through the gazillion gadgets in circulation today to come up with
10 that have one thing in common:
</P>
<P>
   They are so cool, they make guys drool.
</P>
<P>
   I-GLASSES
</P>
<P>
   Who needs a big-screen TV when you can wear a virtual theater on
your head? I-O Display Systems' 8-ounce i-glasses will adorn your
noggin with adjustable earphones and two 0.7-inch displays that
create the illusion of watching an 80-inch screen floating about 11
feet in front of your face. You can plug them into a television,
VCR, cable or video game console. For an extra $1,000, you can get
the Televizer package, which includes the i-glasses and a Panasonic
P-10 portable DVD player and a carrying case.
</P>
<P>
   What it costs: $499 for just the i-glasses, $1,499 for the
Televizer package.
</P>
<P>
   Where to buy it: online at www.i-glasses.com.
</P>
<P>
   Why you've gotta have it: Obviously, so you can sit in the
corner and rock yourself into a high-definition stupor while
watching an 80-inch screen no one else can see.
</P>
<P>
   WEARABLE COMPUTER
</P>
<P>
   The lights are low. Soft music is playing. Time to slip into
something a little more comfortable? Nah. Time to strap on this
awesome hunk of hardware and surf the World Wide Web all night.
</P>
<P>
   The Xybernaut wearable computer features a 233 megahertz
computer with a 4 gig hard drive and 128 megs of RAM. It lets you
send and receive live video through an eyepiece and a head-mounted
camera. It gives you full Internet access anywhere, anytime via
cell phone uplink, and allows you to type the next ``War and
Peace'' (or dictate it into a microphone) while jogging through the
park. Here's how it works: A keyboard straps to your wrist. A
battery-powered, 28-ounce computer slips onto a belt and hooks up
to a headset, which includes a miniature video camera mounted above
one eye, a tiny display contraption above the other eye, and a
microphone at your mouth. A separate wrist-mounted monitor can also
be connected to the computer, as can a cell phone and a plethora of
other goodies.
</P>
<P>
   What it costs: From $5,000 to $10,000, depending on what bells
and whistles you get.
</P>
<P>
   Where to buy it: www.xybernaut.com, or wait a year, when a
lighter, better and cheaper version is expected to be released to
stores.
</P>
<P>
   Why you've gotta have it: Cut the grass and defragment your hard
drive at the same time! Dash to the fridge without putting the game
on pause! Best of all: It's not just a computer, it's a fashion
statement. INTERNET WATCH
</P>
<P>
   New kind of watch? Yawn. New way of telling time? Now you've got
our attention.
</P>
<P>
   Swatch has invented Internet time. It took the standard 24-hour
day and divided it into 1,000 beats. Each beat is equivalent to 1
minute and 26.4 seconds, with the meridian in Biel, Switzerland,
world headquarters of Swatch. So when you're wearing the Swatch
Beat watch, the Internet day begins (at)000, or midnight Biel Mean
Time, and runs through 999. That means no more time-zone trauma:
When you and Aussiegal agree to a Diablo deathmatch (at)539, you'll
both know exactly what time to show up.
</P>
<P>
   The Swatch Beat also allows you to protect your e-mail downloads
using a microchip embedded in the watch and a special mousepad.
When the watch comes in contact with the mousepad, the computer
automatically downloads your e-mail. If your chip doesn't match-up,
then no e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   What it costs: The standard Swatch Beat watch costs $70 and the
Swatch Access Beat Watch (with mousepad) is expected to cost $160.
</P>
<P>
   Where to buy it: Most upscale watch stores, but the Swatch
Access Beat Watch isn't expected until the end of the year. Check
www.swatch.com for more info.
</P>
<P>
   Why you've gotta have it: No cyber-junkie should do without this
cool little timepiece, which also happens to feature a fixed
countdown to the Year 2K. Once the year 2000 hits, you can
reprogram the timer to countdown to whatever you want, assuming we
are all still here ...
</P>
<P>
   SEGA DREAMCAST
</P>
<P>
   The battle between video game consoles and computers has been
tooth-and-nail, but Sega's Dreamcast ends all that by combining the
two. The bulky little game console comes with artificial
intelligence, a 56k modem and Web browsing software so you can play
a game on the Net with your buddy or use it to send and receive
e-mail. Before you know it, the Dreamcast will be doing what it
does best: Sucking away your will to socialize, until life becomes
a blur of mind-numbing eye-candy and booming digital sound.
</P>
<P>
   What it costs: $199.99
</P>
<P>
   Where to buy it: Go to any toy or electronic story and wait for
the next shipment to come in.
</P>
<P>
   Why you've gotta have it: It, um, stimulates right-brain
activity and helps develop eye-hand coordination. (It also happens
to be the slickest, fastest, most intelligent gaming system to see
the light of day. Who needs a computer?)
</P>
<P>
   HAL2000
</P>
<P>
   Kick back and boss your house around with the latest in
automated living systems from Home Automated Living. The HAL2000
uses voice recognition and your home's existing wiring to control
the thermostat, lighting, electrical appliances and security
system. The system keeps track of to-do lists and appointments, and
will even hop on the Internet to answer your questions. Don't
bother with the Weather Channel, just ask your house if it's gonna
rain! HAL uses your Internet connection to hook-up and retrieve TV
listings, e-mail, stock information, news, sports and traffic
reports. You talk to Hal through a microphone connected to its
computer, or by picking up any phone in the house. You can also
call in while you're away and tell your house what to do. Just
don't try to unplug HAL once it's up and running. I'm afraid that's
something I cannot allow to happen.
</P>
<P>
   What it costs: The basic HAL2000 unit costs $389. Add-ons run
from $8 to $249.
</P>
<P>
   Where to buy it: Online at www.automatedliving.com.
</P>
<P>
   Why you've gotta have it: Think of the money you'll save having
HAL around to turn off the hall light. (For a gadget geek, it
doesn't get any better than a talking house that does your
bidding.)
</P>
<P>
   PERSONAL ROBOT
</P>
<P>
   George Jetson had one, why not you? This 5-inch-tall,
16-inch-wide midget machine named Cye, will vacuum your floors,
deliver the mail and act like a robotic pup. The wheeled tyke from
Probotics Inc., resembles a dustpan and is controlled by your PC
via a wireless link. You can use your mouse to guide the bot
through the house, or let it explore on its own. A point-and-click
map shows you where the robot is and what areas have been explored.
You can also program it for automatic tasks, like vacuuming the
house when the in-laws are coming over for dinner. So what if it
can't mix a martini or swing its arms about wildly and shout
``Danger Will Robinson!'' (it doesn't even have arms). You'll still
have the niftiest robot on your block.
</P>
<P>
   What it costs: $695; a vacuum attachment or wagon will run you
an additional $89 each.
</P>
<P>
   Where to buy it: It's available at www.personalrobots.com now,
but not yet in stores.
</P>
<P>
   Why you've gotta have it: Not only will this puppy take the
drudgery out of those daily household chores, it'll take the
drudgery out of your life by letting you chase the cat, close and
open every door in the house over and over again, and four-wheel up
that couch you just bought.
</P>
<P>
   WATCH PHONE
</P>
<P>
   Keeping time has been so overdone, what's a poor watch to do?
Become a cell phone, of course. The SwatchTalk looks like a normal
wristwatch, but 12 inconspicuous buttons around its outer edge and
a hidden microphone and speaker turn it into a watch that would
make Maxwell Smart jealous. A digital display lets you see what
number you're calling, and a ring lets you know when it's time to
answer your watch. Swatch promises that the speakers and microphone
are loud enough to be used without taking the watch off your wrist.
SwatchTalk comes with a charger that will give your watch enough
power to last a ``reasonable'' day.
</P>
<P>
   What it costs: Will list for about $350.
</P>
<P>
   Where to buy it: You can't. Swatch is working on extending the
battery life and making it compatible with mobile phone standards
in the U.S. and elsewhere. Look for it in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Why you've gotta have it: The convenience of cellular technology
without the inconvenience of keeping track of a cell phone.
Besides, now you'll be able to talk into your watch and, this time,
someone will be able to hear you on the other end. Dick Tracy out!

   INSIDE TRACK
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, at a news conference in Arlington, Eddie Chiles
introduced George W. Bush as the buyer of his Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``George is our kind of people,'' Chiles said. ``Texas people.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiles had known Bush for four decades and, when George was a
child, had let the Bush family use his private plane to fly Bush's
little sister to New York for cancer treatment.
</P>
<P>
   While other investors were clamoring for a chance to buy the
team, Bush said he had an inside track because Chiles was
``family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The other groups, in my opinion, never had a chance,'' Bush
said. ``Maybe it was an unfair advantage that I've known Eddie
since I was 3 years old. Too bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has often been on the right side of that equation. From the
oil patch to the Rangers to his campaign for the presidency, he has
been boosted by friends and family.
</P>
<P>
   His uncle Jonathan often helped him raise drilling funds for his
oil ventures in Midland. A prominent Wall Street executive,
Jonathan Bush tapped industry leaders, including George Ball of
E.F. Hutton and William Draper III of the Export-Import Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Philip Uzielli _ a close friend of James A. Baker III,
who was later secretary of state under Bush's father _ put up a
crucial $1 million when his oil company needed cash.
</P>
<P>
   In baseball, Bush benefited from more than just the Chiles
connection.
</P>
<P>
   Bush first considered a bid for the Rangers after receiving a
phone call from Bill DeWitt Jr., another man from a powerful
family. DeWitt's father was the former owner of the Cincinnati Reds
and a close friend of another Bush uncle in St. Louis. Four years
earlier, when Bush's oil company was struggling to raise money,
DeWitt's oil firm stepped up and offered a merger that strengthened
both operations.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling together in the mid-'80s on oil business, Bush and
DeWitt talked about running a baseball team. Soon after Bush's
father was elected president in 1988, DeWitt called and suggested
they put together a group to buy the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Chiles' health and finances were faltering. He had
tried to sell the Rangers to Ed Gaylord, a broadcast mogul in
Oklahoma City, and then Frank Marsoni, a Tampa, Fla., car dealer.
But baseball owners opposed them, fearing that Gaylord might use
the team to anchor a TV superstation and that Marsoni would move
the Rangers to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush emerged as a potential buyer, several people in
baseball were thrilled, says Bobby Brown, then the president of the
American League.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was seen as an affable, honest guy who respected the game
and its traditions, Brown says. His father was also a big fan who
had been captain of his Yale baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel that the president had any direct bearing on the
negotiations,'' Brown said about the sale to the Bush-led group.
``But obviously, if you have someone with that name and his
father's the president, that doesn't hurt you. I think everybody
realized that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush had to hustle to make it happen. He started by calling on
Chiles soon after Gaylord and Marsoni dropped out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the first guy to knock on the door and I kept
knocking,'' Bush said, knowing that others planned to bid on the
Rangers. ``Eddie realized I would be a good steward of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognized this wasn't just an asset of Eddie Chiles. This
was something he loved a lot and I convinced him I would love it a
lot, too.''
</P>
<P>
   To raise money, Bush reached out to classmates from Yale, such
as Roland Betts, and to partners from the oil industry, such as
DeWitt. Some of his father's friends, including former campaign
manager Frederick Malek, were among more than 70 people who
invested.
</P>
<P>
   Bush still needed a big boost from Peter Ueberroth, then
commissioner of baseball. Ueberroth wanted the Bush group to have
more investors from Texas, believing it would ensure that the team
remained in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Ueberroth personally called on Richard Rainwater at his Fort
Worth office. He persuaded the financier to join the group, even
though Rainwater had rejected a similar appeal from Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Rainwater brought in Rusty Rose of Dallas, and the two renowned
investors contributed more than $6 million, about 10 times the
amount that Bush put in.
</P>
<P>
   Rose would be the point man for finance, while Bush would handle
the public part of the business, including dealing with reporters,
other owners and fans.
</P>
<P>
   Rainwater and Rose declined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Through James Langdon, a friend in Washington, Bush recruited
Schieffer, a Fort Worth lawyer who had teamed with a competing
bidder. Bush needed Schieffer's $1.4 million investment, but he
also wanted to add another Fort Worth voice.
</P>
<P>
   The Schieffer call paid dividends, because he eventually became
part of the executive team. Bush and Rose later chose Schieffer to
be team president and oversee construction of The Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush left for Austin at the end of '94, Schieffer assumed
Bush's role as managing general partner, along with his six-figure
salary.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said that his Rangers' tenure represents the crowning
achievement of his business life. His group bought the team for the
equivalent of $86 million in April 1989. Nine years later, with The
Ballpark firmly established as a top facility and the team's record
improving, the franchise and surrounding property fetched $250
million from Dallas financier Tom Hicks.

UNDATED: Tom Hicks. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For buying and leading the team, Bush earned $15 million on an
investment of $606,000. Another $1 million to $2 million may come
later, when all accounts are closed.
</P>
<P>
   The big payday stems from a provision that funneled 15 percent
of the investment's capital gains into ``back-end bonuses.'' Bush
received two-thirds of that money and Rose the other third because
they served as managing partners and put more hours into the
business.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also received a higher share for pulling together the
purchase, and got the full bonus even though he gave up the top job
four years earlier to be governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``George was the catalyst,'' Schieffer said. ``If George wasn't
there, I don't think it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   ON-HAND OPERATOR
</P>
<P>
   Jim McAninch remembers the time he called Bush at home at about
4 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   It was the mid-'80s in Midland, and one of their wells had come
in unexpectedly. McAninch, Bush's oilfield engineer for four years,
needed the boss' OK to rush in four tank cars.
</P>
<P>
   They talked it over and Bush gave the go-ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was George's company and he ran it that way,'' McAninch
said.
</P>
<P>
   As a businessman, Bush was more than just a famous name,
colleagues say. Both in oil and baseball, he is described as a
visible, hands-on executive who mixed with employees.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is primarily known for raising money in the oil patch and
for pulling together the Rangers' purchase. But in Midland in 1984,
DeWitt's Spectrum 7 Exploration sought out Bush for his operating
skills.
</P>
<P>
   Spectrum, whose owners were based in Cincinnati, had raised
nearly $6 million and was looking to drill in West Texas. When
owner DeWitt asked his sole Texas employee, geologist Paul Rea, to
suggest a partner to provide drilling sites and oil workers, he
proposed Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Rea and Bush had been friends since 1975, and Rea trusted him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at deals in the oil business, the character of a
person is important,'' Rea said. ``A lot of deals are done on a
handshake, and the paperwork comes in a few weeks later. I knew
that George was completely honest.''
</P>
<P>
   In baseball, Bush also took an active, visible role. He shunned
the owner's private box near the upper deck and sat behind the
dugout so he could mingle with fans and get a better view of the
action.
</P>
<P>
   He helped sell season tickets by making cold calls to
prospective customers. He frequently spoke Spanish with Latin
players, foreshadowing how he would later use language to reach
Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, as he campaigns for president, Bush fondly recalls
his Arlington days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was realizing a dream,'' Bush said during a recent stop in
New Orleans. ``It was a really good part of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   DeWitt, Hicks and others credit Bush with improving the
franchise. DeWitt, now chairman of the St. Louis Cardinals, says
that Bush developed a good relationship with Rose, the finance man,
and had the foresight to tap Schieffer for a key role.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the 1994 baseball strike, the ownership group never had
to make ``a capital call,'' seeking more money to keep the team
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a reason that the Rangers have come into prominence as
one of the premier franchises today,'' DeWitt said. ``A lot of it
is due to George's leadership during the early years.''
</P>
<P>
   DeWitt says that Bush's ultimate achievement was completing The
Ballpark without a major incident or scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Greene, now associate publisher of the Arlington
Star-Telegram, was mayor of Arlington during the stadium election.
Bush, Rose, Schieffer and Greene developed the proposal for a
half-cent sales tax increase to provide $135 million toward The
Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Greene says that city officials took the lead role in selling
the proposal, but that Bush and Schieffer often participated.
Greene recalls the time that Bush appeared on a live TV show to
debate the merits of the referendum. Bush also appeared on radio
talk shows and made personal appearances, including at area
churches.
</P>
<P>
   On election day, he visited phone centers to encourage workers
who were trying to get voters out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did everything we asked him to do,'' Greene said.
</P>
<P>
   In the largest turnout in Arlington history, the proposal passed
by a 2-to-1 margin in January 1991. Opponents criticized the idea
of subsidizing wealthy baseball owners, but the overwhelming
victory silenced many critics and dispelled any lingering acrimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody felt that the other party was getting jobbed,'' said
Brown, the former American League president who now lives in Fort
Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Some say Bush used his Rangers' post as a public relations
platform, recalling how he would sign autographs on glossy photos
provided at the stadium. Others believe Bush, who regularly met
with reporters and fans before home games, was simply being
accessible and accountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really respected the fact that he always sat in the front
row at the ballpark, whether we were doing well or not doing
well,'' said Nolan Ryan, the Hall-of-Fame pitcher who joined the
team just before the Bush group took over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sitting with the fans, he didn't hide; he always signed
autographs and talked about the team,'' Ryan said. ``I think the
fans realized he was a baseball fan and was committed to doing
everything he could to make the Rangers a top-notch organization.''

UNDATED: top-notch organization.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Employees say that Bush gained their respect by declining to
duck the public when the team was struggling. Tom Grieve, general
manager during the Bush years and now a Rangers announcer, recalls
when fans would boo him and Bush during losing streaks. They
especially criticized Bush for not spending more to attract free
agents.
</P>
<P>
   Grieve says Bush would often walk from his stadium seat to the
angry fans, greet them with a smile and handshake, and start
talking baseball. That usually defused the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took the heat, boy, more than any of us,'' Grieve said.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICIAN'S SKILL
</P>
<P>
   As a baseball owner, Bush showed a politician's skill at
sidestepping some controversies. At other times, he was willing to
speak out.
</P>
<P>
   When The Ballpark was being built and minority companies said
that they weren't getting their share of contracts, Bush deferred
the dispute to Schieffer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, when he was campaigning for Texas governor, baseball
players went on strike and Bush declined to discuss the issues that
were ripping apart the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all agreed that it was more important for George to be
talking about what he wanted to do for the schoolchildren of
Texas,'' Schieffer said, even though Bush still held the title of
managing general partner.
</P>
<P>
   Schieffer, rather than Bush, became the target for angry players
and fans. When the owners tried to use replacement players the next
spring _ and the plan failed dismally _ Bush was living in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   At Major League Baseball meetings, Bush wasn't shy about voting
against the tide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tend to tell people what I think,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   He battled other owners over the decision to oust Fay Vincent as
commissioner. He argued that expansion fees from the National
League should be shared with the American League and won some
concessions, with the Rangers and other American League teams each
receiving $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush was the lone opponent to league realignment, which
lumped teams into six divisions and expanded the playoffs. After
many heated discussions, Bush was told that the Rangers would cast
the first vote on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Bush jutted out his jaw defiantly, according to Schieffer, and
said, ``Good. I want everybody to know we're a `No.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The owners overruled him, 27 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't mind expressing my opinions, and I still don't,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown says that owners appreciated Bush's directness, and that
things never got personal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never left as enemies,'' Brown said. ``George always had
the ability to disagree without being disagreeable.''
</P>
<P>
   In quarterly meetings with the Rangers' limited partners, Bush
and Grieve were often challenged about the team's performance. One
owner harped on the disastrous trade that sent Sammy Sosa and
pitcher Wilson Alvarez to the White Sox for designated hitter
Harold Baines. Sosa, then one of the team's most promising
youngsters, went on to become a top slugger and national celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   The internal complaints never became public, and for that, many
credit Bush. Brown says it's tough to keep harmony among wealthy
executives who usually believe they know the answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two things the American male thinks he can do better
than anybody else,'' Brown said. ``One is barbecue a steak; the
other is manage a big league baseball team.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, when Bush took over the Rangers, the club was
known for scrimping on salaries and passing on highly paid
athletes. But The Ballpark changed all that, generating enough
revenue to let the Rangers now boast one of the league's highest
payrolls. With some of the brightest stars in baseball, the team
has won three division crowns since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In the first four years under Bush, the Rangers' attendance grew
42 percent, helped in large part by Ryan's huge appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, when The Ballpark opened, the team was on pace to
attract 3 million fans, compared with 1.58 million in 1988, the
year before Bush took over. But with two months remaining, the
players' strike canceled the season.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue for the Rangers soared from $28.8 million in 1988 to
$62.4 million in '93. When the strike hit, the team was on pace to
approach $80 million in revenue. This year, the team brought in
more than $110 million.
</P>
<P>
   Some people, including Bush's friend Betts, have said that Bush
pursued the Rangers because the team could propel his political
career. In the early '90s, Bush frequently toured Texas to promote
the Rangers and raise money for Republican candidates. But he was
irritated when reporters suggested that he was biding time, waiting
for politics to call.
</P>
<P>
   Bush twice corrected a Star-Telegram sportswriter for calling
him a politician in print; Bush insisted that he should be
described as a businessman.
</P>
<P>
   He still wants to evoke that image of his earlier days. On the
campaign trail, Bush dismissed Betts' view, saying he was neither
that calculating nor that focused on politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little more entrepreneurial than that,'' Bush said.

MERGER DEALS KEPT BUSH AFLOAT IN TURBULENT OIL PATCH OF '80S 
(ACCOMPANIES BUSH-PROFILE)
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By MITCHELL SCHNURMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush didn't hit a home run in the oil patch, but he
didn't strike out either.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of 10 years, Bush's oil company never hit the
big gusher and lost millions of investors' dollars during one of
the most turbulent times in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   But faced with mounting losses, Bush twice engineered merger
deals with better-financed companies, which ultimately gave him
more than $800,000 to launch a purchase of the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Given the tumultuous times, ``I think I was a success in the oil
business,'' Bush said in an earlier interview.
</P>
<P>
   Bush learned the oil business from the ground up, returning to
West Texas in 1975 after graduating from Harvard Business School.
He negotiated land leases, took classes on geology, raised drilling
funds and built a small company.
</P>
<P>
   With his pedigree and contacts, he could have chosen a less
risky, morelucrative career, says political analyst Cal Jillson of
Southern Methodist University in Dallas. But Bush chose to follow
the same path as his father a generation earlier in the
rough-and-tumble oil patch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in his business life, George really wanted to make it on
his own,'' Jillson said. ``He made a real run for it in Midland.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while, his results tracked the oil industry. He was a
millionaire on paper by early 1982, when prices were soaring. But
the bust quickly cut his fortune in half.
</P>
<P>
   From 1979 to 1984, Bush raised $4.7 million from investors. His
firm, initially called Arbusto Energy and later Bush Exploration,
returned just $1.55 million to backers, according to company
documents.
</P>
<P>
   Investors also got tax write-offs of $3.3 million, benefiting
from tax laws that encouraged domestic exploration. Bush, as top
executive, was paid $75,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did all the right things,'' said K. Michael Conaway, Bush's
chief financial officer for five years in Midland. ``We just
weren't lucky enough to find oil and gas.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also suffered from poor timing. On July 28, 1982,
Bush's partnership tried to raise $6 million with a public
offering. But the first wave of the oil bust had hit about three
weeks earlier, and he raised only $1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bush found 28,000 barrels of oil at a cost of $36 a barrel, six
times the average cost in the industry, according to documents. The
following year, Bush wrote off half of his investors' money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bust,'' Bush acknowledged in a 1994 interview with
the Star-Telegram.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Bush had more than 15 employees and, with his poor
drilling record, few prospects for raising more money. Conaway says
Bush imposed a 10-percent cut in salaries for everyone, including
himself.
</P>
<P>
   A more promising solution surfaced when Ohio businessman Bill
DeWitt Jr. inquired about a merger. Like Bush, DeWitt was from a
wealthy family. His father had been friends with a Bush uncle in
St. Louis many years earlier. Now DeWitt was looking for an
operating oil firm to join his Spectrum 7 Exploration venture.
</P>
<P>
   The companies merged in a stock swap. Bush received about 16
percent of the stock in the new company and was named chief
executive of Spectrum 7. Geologist Paul Rea, Spectrum's only
employee in Midland, became president.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, the price of oil plunged from $29 a barrel to $10 in
four months, and hundreds of wells were being closed nationwide.
Spectrum recorded growing losses and stood at a crossroads. Bush
decided Spectrum either had to get bigger or be bought out.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to find an acquisition candidate, Conaway said, Bush
jumped at the chance to sell out to Harken Energy, a publicly
traded company that was buying up troubled competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Harken, then based in a Fort Worth suburb, offered stock valued
at $2.25 million. That represented a premium over Spectrum's book
value of $1.8 million, but Rea said the company's assets included
drilling prospects valued at zero on the books.
</P>
<P>
   Like most oil stocks, Harken's shares were depressed at the
time. Monte Swetnam, who later became president of Harken
Exploration, said the stock deal ``was like trading two dogs valued
at $500 each for a cat valued at $1,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the sale, Bush gained a seat on Harken's board, stock
options and a consulting role that paid him up to $120,000, plus
benefits. Supporters say that he brought broad experience to the
Harken role, having weathered the industry for 10 turbulent years.
</P>
<P>
   By 1990, oil prices had stabilized and Harken's stock price had
improved. Bush sold nearly all his Harken holdings for $848,560.
</P>
<P>
   Rea says that Bush did well, considering the energy collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least we got something,'' Rea said. ``George hung in there
and didn't go under. He was a survivor during the toughest times,
and not many were.''
</P>
<P>
   Swetnam said that Harken had offered board seats to executives
of other acquired firms and that the company did not hire Bush for
his connections, including to his father, then vice president.
Swetnam said he could not recall any producing properties that
resulted from a Bush lead.
</P>
<P>
   Bush came under scrutiny in 1990 for two Harken matters: failing
to promptly report the sale of his Harken stock, and the awarding
to Harken of a drilling contact with Bahrain in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that he filed the necessary documents reporting the
Harken stock sale but that the Securities and Exchange Commission
must have lost the report. The SEC eventually dropped the matter.
</P>
<P>
   On the Bahrain contract, media outlets investigated whether
Harken was selected because the emirate wanted to curry favor with
Bush's father, then president. Swetnam said he met with reporters
from Newsweek, Time and The Wall Street Journal because they were
investigating the connection between Bush and the contract. Harken
had never drilled a deep well in that part of the world.
</P>
<P>
   But Swetnam, who negotiated the contract, said that neither Bush
nor his father played any role in the talks, and media reports did
not dispute that account. Swetnam said Bush was actually the only
Harken board member to oppose the project. The rest of the board
disagreed, and Swetnam later struck a partnership with the Bass
brothers of Fort Worth to provide financing and drilling expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Harken drilled two wells near Bahrain, but both were dry holes.

BUSH CRITICIZED OVER HANDLING OF MINORITY CONTRACTS FOR BALLPARK 
(ACCOMPANIES BUSH-PROFILE)
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ While he enjoyed a near trouble-free reign as
an owner of the Texas Rangers, George W. Bush was criticized for
how the team handled minority contracts at the The Ballpark in
Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   The Arlington City Council agreed to rely on the Rangers to
encourage diverse and local participation in the ballpark's
construction. The council did not insist on quotas or contracting
goals for companies owned by minorities, women or local
businesspeople.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-1993, minority groups complained that they were not
benefiting from the project as Bush had promised during the
campaign for voter approval of a half-cent sales tax. Some remain
bitter today, recalling how Bush visited black churches and asked
for their support at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of minorities were questioning where they would fit into
the project,'' said Harry Gudger, former president of the Arlington
branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People. ``He stated that minorities would get a part of that. As
things started unfolding, there was an exclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Comer Cottrell, a Bush partner in ownership of the Rangers and
well-known African-American businessman, also criticized the team's
handling of minority contracting.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said in July 1993 that minority firms won many of the
contracts that they bid on. He said the Rangers could not be blamed
if more minorities and women didn't try to get involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people don't want to bid, we can't force them to bid; we
can do our best to get them to bid,'' Bush told the Star-Telegram.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bush avoided much of the debate, especially when it
became heated. He deferred to Tom Schieffer, who was Rangers
president and responsible for letting the contracts. Near the peak
of the controversy, Bush and Schieffer hired Norman Lyons, an
African-American businessman who was active in civic affairs, for
the new position of vice president of community relations.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons then began working with minority contractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush was amazingly silent'' when it came to pushing for
these groups, said Luther Felder, then pastor of Grace United
Methodist Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was part owner and he was in charge,'' Felder said. ``But
he wasn't able or didn't try to change that project to make it
inclusive of the minority contractors.''
</P>
<P>
   Minority- or women-owned businesses bid on $20 million worth of
contracts on the $193 million project and won $9 million, Lyons
said.
</P>
<P>
   The total was about 5 percent. That compares with about 30
percent minority contracting for Lone Star Park in Grand Prairie,
and a 25 percent goal proposed for the new arena in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to get more people to bid,'' Lyons said. ``This
is not an excuse, but in some cases, like seats, there were only
one or two companies in the U.S. who did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other minority- or women-owned firms couldn't win contracts
because they couldn't do the work in the short time frames required
by the team, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons said that in September 1993, shortly after he was hired
and in the midst of the flap over construction contracts, 5,000
small and midsize minority- and women-owned companies were
contacted about bidding on remaining contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The ballpark concessionaire, Sportservice, also sought minority-
or women-owned businesses as suppliers, Lyons said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers also determined that minority workers made up 71.5
percent of those who worked on the ballpark project and accounted
for about $20 million in payroll during that time, Lyons said.

WHEN YOU WISH UPON A DVD 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By ROB LOWMAN 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was Walt Disney's second full-length animated
feature, and Tuesday it becomes the first of his classics to be
released on DVD. Some have argued that the 1940 ``Pinocchio'' was
the studio's greatest achievement.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Disney used groundbreaking animation techniques to
create ``Pinocchio,'' including the multiplane camera, which allows
for the illusion that the camera is moving through a scene as
though it were live action. It took some 750 artists to produce 2
million drawings for the 88-minute film, and the texture and
richness of the animation is still unsurpassed.
</P>
<P>
   But all this wizardry would be a cinematic footnote if it
weren't for the enduring and endearing quality of the storytelling.
The tale of the wooden puppet who is given life has entertained
countless children through the years, but it's the story's moral
underpinnings that give it resonance.
</P>
<P>
   To become a real boy, Pinocchio (Dick Jones) is told by the Blue
Fairy (Evelyn Venable) he must learn honesty, loyalty and right
from wrong. It sounds like a recipe for boredom, but since it's a
plot device, the lesson isn't overbearing. Rather, the moral is
served up in an entertaining way, and there is no character more
entertaining for kids than Pinocchio's ``conscience,'' Jiminy
Cricket (voiced by Cliff Edwards).
</P>
<P>
   It's Jiminy who sings the Oscar-winning tune ``When You Wish
Upon a Star,''which would become a Disney theme song, and as
narrator he serves as both comic relief and a voice for the story's
themes.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1940, the cricket has become something of an icon
(representing either the world of Disney or goodness, depending on
your point of view), or as an exclamation (as in ``Jimmmmmminy
Cricket!'').
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't seen ``Pinocchio'' in a while, you may be
surprised how well it holds up after all these years, and its
message is timeless. The limited-edition DVD lists for $39.99, but
you should be able to find it cheaper. It looks great, but, unlike
many DVDs, there are few extras (the most notable here being the
original trailer). Inexplicably, there is only a ``making of
featurette'' for ``Pinocchio'' on the VHS tape, something you would
expect on the DVD. It's too bad for film buffs, and it makes owning
the DVD less imperative.

PERSONAL HEALTH: LITTLE-KNOWN KILLER OF THE YOUNG AND THE SEEMINGLY
HEALTHY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Fixes slug, adds contact information at end) 
 (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An apparently healthy, athletic 7-year-old boy named Billy dies
mysteriously in his sleep in his bedroom in Sarasota, Fla., while
his father grinds coffee in the nearby kitchen. An apparently
healthy 19-year-old woman from Minnesota, known to be a good
swimmer, dies after a near-drowning while swimming laps in a pool 4
feet deep. An apparently healthy 30-year-old Florida mother walks
to a fountain for a drink after playing soccer and drops dead.
</P>
<P>
   These three are among as many as 4,000 children and young adults
who died last year of long QT syndrome, a usually unrecognized
inherited defect in the heart's rhythm. Often, the first clue that
something is wrong with the way the heart beats is sudden cardiac
death. The heart muscle suddenly goes into fibrillation, beating so
fast and shallowly that no blood can circulate. Unless the heart is
shocked back into a normal rhythm within a few minutes, there is
little hope for survival.
</P>
<P>
   Long QT syndrome is believed to be a common cause of unexplained
sudden deaths among school athletes, as well as the probable cause
of many unexplained drownings.
</P>
<P>
   Long QT syndrome is caused by a mutation in a gene that
regulates the heart's electrical system. The mutation causes a
defect in heart muscle structures called ion channels that
predisposes the heart to lapse into a very rapid, ineffectual
rhythm called fibrillation.
</P>
<P>
   The syndrome is named for the QT segment of the
electrocardiogram, which lasts slightly longer than normal. It is
usually a hidden defect because few children and young adults have
electrocardiograms. In most cases, the mutation is inherited as an
autosomal dominant, which means the defective gene is located on a
non-sex chromosome and each child of an affected parent has a 50-50
chance of inheriting it.
</P>
<P>
   In patients with the syndrome, the heart takes longer to
recharge itself between beats. Under most circumstances, this
causes no symptoms. However, certain conditions can set off an
abnormal cardiac rhythm, resulting in fainting spells, dizziness,
palpitations, seizures or sudden death. Among the factors known to
start erratic beating of an affected heart are swimming, intense
physical exertion or being suddenly startled or frightened.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the 19-year-old swimmer and 30-year-old soccer
player, intense physical activity was the likely trigger. But Billy
was asleep when he died. His mother, Sharon Levy, suspects that the
noise of the coffee grinder may have set off his fatal cardiac
rhythm. Or perhaps he had been frightened by a bad dream.
</P>
<P>
   Early diagnosis, while a person is still well, can be
life-saving. In about 90 percent of cases, daily doses of the drugs
called beta-blockers can help to maintain a normal heart rhythm.
For others, a pacemaker can be implanted to regulate the heart's
rhythm or an automatic defibrillator can be installed that can
instantly detect and correct an erratic rhythm. The Florida woman's
sisters, for example, who also have long QT syndrome, now have
automatic defibrillators.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. G. Michael Vincent of Salt Lake City, medical director of
the Sudden Arrhythmia Death Syndromes (SADS) Foundation, recommends
that children with long QT syndrome refrain from competitive sports
and that coaches and teachers should never push such a child to
engage in an activity associated with instense physical or
emotional stimulation.
</P>
<P>
   Noncompetitive, recreational activities are usually appropriate
for people with long QT syndrome, Dr. Vincent said, but they should
stop whatever they are doing if they experience palpitations,
lightheadedness, weakness or blurry vision. Stopping the activity
can often prevent progression to more serious symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   A buddy system is advisable during activities so that someone
can be on the lookout for early symptoms. Because swimming or
entering a pool is especially dangerous for people with long QT
syndrome, they should always be accompanied by a knowledgeable
person who can rescue them if necessary. However, Vincent said, any
patient who experiences symptoms of long QT syndrome and is not
receiving treatment should avoid all physical activities and even
strong emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Unless a sophisticated genetic analysis is performed, long QT
syndrome cannot be detected after a person dies. In most cases,
however, by testing other blood relatives it is usually possible to
make a correct determination of the cause of death. Mrs. Levy said
Billy was an adopted child and the pediatric medical examiner who
performed the autopsy suspected long QT syndrome had caused his
death. This prompted Mrs. Levy to search for Billy's birth parents
because in all likelihood one of them carried the same defective
gene. His biological mother tested normal, but his father, age 20,
was found to have long QT syndrome, a diagnosis that may well save
him and any future children he may have from sudden, premature
death.
</P>
<P>
   But diagnosing long QT syndrome can be tricky. In about 10
percent of cases, the QT interval on the initial electrocardiogram
appears normal, and in another 40 percent, the QT interval is not
sufficiently prolonged to permit a clear-cut diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   For example, before the Minnesota woman died, her
electrocardiogram suggested that she had long QT syndrome, which
could have been caused by complications resulting from her
near-drowning. But suspicious physicians at the Mayo Clinic decided
to analyze a piece of her heart muscle removed at autopsy to see if
there was a defect in the gene linked to this syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   They found a mutation, then tested her relatives for the
syndrome. Her maternal grandfather, mother and an 18-year-old
sister were found to have the mutation, and the mother's
electrocardiogram also showed long QT syndrome. But the sister's
electrocardiogram appeared to be normal _ only one of eight
cardiologists judged it abnormal. However, because she carried the
defective gene, she is now receiving daily treatment with a
beta-blocker to reduce her risk of sudden death.
</P>
<P>
   The SADS Foundation emphasizes that any young person who
experiences fainting episodes or seizures should be tested for long
QT syndrome. Anyone who suffers an unexplained loss of
consciousness should have an electrocardiogram done. So should
anyone with a family history of unexplained fainting or sudden
death in young people. Because one-third of people with this
syndrome have no symptoms, it is not safe to assume that a person
without symptoms has not inherited the syndrome. A symptom-free
person with long QT syndrome is no less susceptible to sudden
death.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mayo Clinic physicians, writing in the Oct. 7 issue of
The New England Journal of Medicine, insist that reliance on an
electrocardiogram is not adequate. They pointed out that without
genetic testing, the 18-year-old sister ``would have been
considered normal and would not have been treated.'' ``She also
would not have received genetic counseling,'' the physicians
continued, ``including information about the 50 percent chance of
passing this mutation to future offspring, the risks associated
with swimming and other strenuous exertion and the list of
medications to avoid.''

BROWN GIVES THE RAIDERS ANOTHER VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHELLE SMITH  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Recent Raiders history is littered with the
carcasses of games they should have won, but didn't. Heck, there
are those cockeyed-optimist types who see an undefeated record in
1999 save for a few unfortunate breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps it's some sort of cosmic justice that the Oakland
Raiders regaled in a 24-23 victory over the New York Jets on
Sunday, because for the better part of three quarters, there wasn't
much taking place at the Coliseum to suggest victory was at hand.
No running game, no open receivers, no way to put a stop to the
rambling of Jets running back Curtis Martin, no way to stem the
tide of turnovers turning into New York scoring opportunities. In
short, no way a team that has played so lackluster as a matter of
course on its home field would come back from a 20-3 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   And then it did.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe these aren't the Same Old Raiders after all. That's not to
suggest, however, that this is a great football team, or perhaps
even a playoff team. But they are good enough right now to beat a
Jets team that was 1-5 coming in with a degree of drama that hasn't
been seen since, well, the week before. Make that seven Raiders
games this season in which the final score was decided by a
touchdown or less.
</P>
<P>
   The difference this time, however, was that it was the Raiders
offense on the field with the psyche of the franchise hanging in
the balance. Quarterback Rich Gannon, who had so much time to throw
and so few people to catch through much of the afternoon,
engineered an 11-play, 90-yard touchdown drive with less than two
minutes left in the game, culminating in a 5-yard touchdown pass to
James Jett with 26 seconds left. The offensive heroics haven't been
seen in these parts since the team was still in its Southern
California parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hung in there, despite the fact that things didn't go well
for us early,'' Gannon said. ``Turnovers were big, fumbles
especially. When you turn the ball over like that, you give the
other team a chance. It was one of those games where we gave them
chances, they took advantage of them and what ultimately happens is
you find yourself down by three scores. We were fortunate to get
out of here with a win.''
</P>
<P>
   And just to confirm the alignment of the planets in the Raiders'
favor, the touchdown pass to win the game went to a guy who wasn't
even supposed to be on the field for that play.
</P>
<P>
   Jett worked his way open in the left corner of the end zone
while Gannon worked his way out of the grasp of two tacklers. The
play was intended for Tim Brown, who was double-covered, not
surprising considering his nearly single-handed resurrection of the
Raiders offense in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Jett was the secondary receiver running an option route, but the
play was designed for Terry Mickens in that role. Raiders head
coach Jon Gruden was trying to get Mickens out onto the field, but
nobody could hear him yelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad he was in there, let's just put it that way,'' Gruden
said after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been in every football game down to the wire,'' Gruden
said. ``That's just how it's going to be with the Oakland Raiders
this year. No matter who we are playing, it's going to be a tight
football game and we've got to expect that.''
</P>
<P>
   Much the same way the Raiders fully expected a fight on their
hands from the Jets, who are not nearly as bad as their record
would indicate.
</P>
<P>
   They knew marquee offensive talents Martin and Keyshawn Johnson
could be significant factors, and they were. They knew Bill
Belichick's defensive game plan would cause them offensive
problems, and it did. They knew they had little room for error and
yet committed four turnovers that led directly to 13 New York
points. And perhaps they knew, from so much experience already this
season, that a game is never really over until it's over, that they
could come back. And they did that too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just huge, anytime you win, but to win like that, with
all that adversity out there,'' center Barrett Robbins said. ``It
can't be a negative. The fact is that we didn't come out and play
as well as we wanted to, but after we settled in the second half
and figured out we were going to have to (throw) the ball to win,
we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the credit goes to Brown, who ended up with 11 catches
for a career-high 190 yards, none bigger than a 45-yard touchdown
pass from Gannon with 29 seconds left in the third quarter to
breathe life back into an Oakland team that was just about to
flat-line again at home against a quarterback-challenged team with
a shoddy record.
</P>
<P>
   ``The play of the day was Tim's touchdown catch to make it 20-10
because it shot some life to our football team,'' Gruden said. ``We
were getting defeated soundly until that play.''

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Let's play an alphabet game, shall we?
</P>
<P>
   Way back in the old days, we listened to LPs, big circles of
black vinyl that were the medium of choice for music for most of
three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Then everything changed, and fast.
</P>
<P>
   First came eight-tracks, then cassettes, then CDs in short
order. Soon after, we had DATs and MDs, and now MP3s, Liquid Audio,
a2b, Super Audio CDs, AM, FM, satellite radio, digital radio,
Internet radio, streaming media, DVD Audio discs and even more, all
fighting for next-generation dominance of how we listen to music.
</P>
<P>
   But music is far from the only place in which this acronymic
acrimony, this techno tussling has broken out.
</P>
<P>
   Movies, TV and even books are changing so quickly we can barely
keep up with the new names and formats, much less buy the new boxes
with which to play them.
</P>
<P>
   Call it format fatigue, the endless assault of new ways to
watch, store and play the media of our lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly is a question of overall consumer confusion.
People are saying, `Why do I need this?' '' acknowledged Jeff
Joseph, vice president for communications for the Consumer
Electronics Manufacturers Association. ``It's become particularly
acute for consumers familiar with the PC. And we certainly
understand and recognize those concerns as an industry.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all about forward progress, about finding faster, smaller,
more capacious, more convenient, more flexible, just plain better
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   But how much forward progress can we stand?
</P>
<P>
   `It's an interesting question,'' said Fabian Wagmister, a UCLA
professor of film and television. ``It really goes way beyond
media, to the extent of whether humans are reaching the limits of
their appetite for consumption of new gimmicky gadgets.''
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, at a certain point, how much of a difference
can we tell between Format A and slightly better Format B?
</P>
<P>
   Richard Clark, a specialist in technology in education at the
University of Southern California, is blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need it,'' Clark said. ``A lot of the more
fine-tuning of technologies isn't of benefit to most people. It's
of incredible benefit to large organizations _ but not to the
individual user.''
</P>
<P>
   And don't even start on computers and the Internet, where
changes in formats, versions and product lifespans are so rapid as
to induce nausea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, right now, if you're not really smart and know
how to install a hundred different plug-ins and know the different
formats, you can't see anything,'' said Wagmister, who founded
UCLA's HyperMedia Studio, where students explore cutting-edge ways
to immerse viewers within new media.
</P>
<P>
   And it's only getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Software product cycles, already short at 18 months to two
years, have begun to evaporate,'' writes James Gleick in ``Faster:
The Acceleration of Just About Everything.''
</P>
<P>
   As Gleick points out, companies continually update software with
patches, bug fixes and minor additions, sometimes within days of
issuing official major revisions. ``Dog years'' _ seven are about
equal to one human year _ have nothing on ``Internet time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Digital culture is perpetual innovation,'' Wagmister said.
``The only way you can make money is by creating version 2.6.1.8.
Otherwise, digital reaches a point of, `This is all I want: The
picture doesn't degrade any more, the sound is really great. What
more do I need?' And how do they make money from that?''
</P>
<P>
   More power and less cost allows us to carry around tiny digital
devices that can play music or movies, access the Internet, send
e-mail, make phone calls, track appointments and contacts or play
sophisticated games.
</P>
<P>
   But how much of this is true progress, and how much of it is a
rat's exercise wheel writ large?
</P>
<P>
   For instance, just (BEGIN ITAL)try(END ITAL) to keep your
computer software current, and on the same version as everyone with
whom you trade files. You can't do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm working on a paper with a former grad student who's about
to go to Thailand, and it's difficult to get our computers to talk
in the same language,'' said Bart Kosko, an information scientist
at USC and author of ``The Fuzzy Future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't just take what I e-mail, open it up and start
writing,'' Kosko said. ``He still gets something with all kinds of
artifacts and defects. If we didn't clean it up when it arrived, it
would literally be garbage after a little while. It's too difficult
for people to share information, even when they have the same
computers and the same software. That's an important market
failure. And it's likely to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   It once seemed as though everything was moving toward ``a more
comprehensive, do-it-all environment,'' Wagmister said.
</P>
<P>
   But a funny thing happened on the way to the techno-forum: We
were given more options than ever. And they don't always talk to
each other well. And you thought technology was going to make
things simpler?
</P>
<P>
   ``Simple? I don't think so, not for a long time,'' Wagmister
said. ``Both in the industry and in the market, there's lot of
confusion about what we want from this.''
</P>
<P>
   And that confusion leads to the Dark Side of technology and its
malcontents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be any man could make a tape,'' Wagmister said.
``But my wife can't even approach the stereo anymore. And there's
an overall fear of what to get next.''
</P>
<P>
   That fear has hamstrung some wonderful technological advances,
too, such as MiniDiscs, or MDs. Sony debuted the format six years
ago, but only this year does the company expect even 500,000 MD
play recorders will be sold worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think MD seems to be very good format,'' Wagmister said.
``Yet it's not taking off. I think it's partially just plain
fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the Paradox of Productivity.
</P>
<P>
   The productivity of American workers has increased at a fairly
steady rate of 2 percent to 3 percent annually for years, Kosko
said. Meanwhile, the rate of investment in technology has
skyrocketed exponentially during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where did all the expenditures go?'' Kosko said. ``You could
argue that the current strong economy is a result of that
investment, though you could point to a lot of other factors as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   So what happened?
</P>
<P>
   ``One possibility is the suggestion that people trade in their
computers and upgrade software too quickly,'' Kosko said.
</P>
<P>
   New computers are astonishingly powerful, even compared to those
of a few years ago. And we can say the same of other electronic
devices that are increasingly driven by the same technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have long since outstripped the chip power we need to
write letters and send e-mail,'' Kosko said. ``You see it also with
people trading in cars far more frequently than they need to. It
suggests this is more of a lifestyle change. Could it be this
fashion thing of trying to keep up? If everybody held on to their
computer twice as long, they might get more bang for their buck.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark, something of a techno-skeptic who is writing a book about
human motivation, has an idea why we do this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Self-confidence is a big motivator,'' said Clark. ``In this
culture, control is a very big issue. People look to technology as
a boost to this personal efficacy. It gives them all kinds of
personal control.''
</P>
<P>
   That allows CEMA's Joseph to confidently proclaim: ``There will
always be markets for those who understand technology and want a
more lifelike experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph says the shift to digital formats _ turning everything
entertainment into a soup of ones and zeros _ means hope for the
future. Ultimately, a single, centralized device called a media
server will store, manage and play each home's movies, TV shows,
Internet access, music, games and more.
</P>
<P>
   The media server would be connected to speakers, monitors and
control devices throughout the house, so one person could surf the
Net, another watch a show, two others play a video game and another
order pizza and a good book.
</P>
<P>
   Companies' fears of the fallout from format fatigue have led
them to more intelligently engineer their products and create
``backward-compatible'' standards, such as for DVD, that allow new
gadgets to play old media as well as better new formats.
</P>
<P>
   But if we really wanted to ease the ache of technology's forward
leaps, Kosko said we'd call a societal timeout on new stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would increase the likelihood that standards would emerge _
and reduce problems with software by making (those standards) work
better together,'' Kosko said. ``It's like picking fruit from one
tree, leaving a lot of it on the branch as you race on to the next
one. You never get mastery of the tools. To put it into two words:
virtuosity evaporates.''
</P>
<P>
   Though we seem to have too little of it, Wagmister said the
passing of time will help ease our techno-woes, as more power
eventually translates into more ease of use, even invisibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a while to know what to do with technology,''
Wagmister said. ``It took filmmaking 20 or 30 years to become what
we know it as. And right now, we're pushing technology into the
market before we know what to do with it. As a consequence, I don't
think we'll see technology making life easier for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   We had better figure this out, though, because Kosko and others
are predicting ``heaven on a chip,'' the transfer of our brain
functions to a device of some sort that mirrors what our gray
matter does in our minds. That's the last place you want to have a
little format conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that sense, there's a scary thought about interoperability
there,'' Kosko said. ``Standards are (BEGIN ITAL)really(END ITAL)
important. But I think this will all work itself out.'' &QL;

NATION'S MORAL AUTHORITY UNDERCUT BY POLITICAL HATRED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JIM WRIGHT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe it's generational, because I watched friends die in World
War II, a bloodbath encouraged by U.S. isolationism. Or because I
bought into the post-war wisdom that partisanship must stop at the
water's edge. Possibly it's because I served in Congress with eight
presidents during those pre-Gingrich years before hate became a
parliamentary weapon, when any American president was considered a
common national asset, our common duty to protect his international
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, I cannot escape the uncomfortable
conviction that the Senate action on Oct. 13, summarily rejecting
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty on a party-line vote, was a
needless assault on the presidential office, from which both the
world and the United States may suffer.
</P>
<P>
   The deliberate Republican leadership decision to ditch the
treaty, launched 40 years ago in Dwight Eisenhower's second
administration and pursued by the last nine American presidents,
was a spiteful personal slap at President Clinton and a blow to
U.S. prestige around the world.
</P>
<P>
   This was the Senate's first open rejection of a major
presidentially sponsored treaty in 80 years, since a ``little group
of willful men'' led by Sen. Henry Cabot Lodge in 1920 killed U.S.
participation in the League of Nations. Most historians believe
that Senate vote, an undisguised personal rebuff to President
Woodrow Wilson, fatally weakened the League, encouraging military
expansion by Hitler and Japan, thus rendering World War II
unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   This month's Senate vote came as a rude surprise to other
nuclear powers whose governments, at our urging, have ratified the
U.S.-sponsored treaty. Russia and China reportedly were ready to
act following the expected U.S. lead. India and Pakistan,
dangerously torn by their explosive rivalry, had been awaiting our
action to make their decisions. Whatever arguments might have
supported the Senate's action, nobody can doubt that the world is,
as its result, a more dangerous place in which U.S. leadership will
be less persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   The partisan showdown was, alas, willful and unnecessary. It
could and should have been avoided. The prime ministers of England,
France and Germany, in an unparalleled expression of concern, had
urged the Senate to avoid a negative vote. Two hours before the
vote, Clinton called Republican leader Trent Lott with a personal
plea to delay action for reasons of national security. Lott airily
rebuffed the president.
</P>
<P>
   With enough GOP votes in his pocket to doom the treaty, Lott
demanded as his price for postponing the vote a signed pledge from
Clinton that he'd never renew his request for treaty consideration
during his term in office. Any such written statement, Lott knew,
would embarrass Clinton personally, badly compromise his world
leadership role, and discourage other countries from signing.
Desperate to head off the potentially fatal collision, Democratic
Senate leader Tom Daschle privately assured Lott he'd personally
see that the vote did not recur this year or next. To no avail.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for insisting on this gratuitous swipe at Clinton
seems clear. Republican leaders detest him so strongly that they'll
risk weakening our country's world role to embarrass him. I find no
other persuasive rationale for Lott's decision.
</P>
<P>
   We've drifted a long way from the days when even members of the
president's opposition party felt a patriotic responsibility to
help protect our chief executive from embarrassment. Here's how I
put it 40 years ago:
</P>
<P>
   ``If he is embarrassed in the eyes of the world, then I am
embarrassed _ because my country is embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Those were my words in House debate one day in 1960. Eisenhower
was president, I a back-bencher Democrat. A witch's brew of
partisan Democrats and conservative Republicans were trying to
defeat an authorization requested by Eisenhower for funding the Pan
American Health Organization. Eisenhower's word to our neighbors in
the hemisphere was on the line. I didn't want his pledge repudiated
for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   That basic proposition, I still believe, has validity. If the
American president is needlessly weakened or discredited in
important diplomatic negotiations with other countries, our nation
suffers.
</P>
<P>
   I felt that way in 1969 when President Richard Nixon called on
North Vietnam to let the Vietnamese conflict be settled by free,
internationally sponsored elections. I introduced a resolution of
congressional support for that Republican president's bargaining
position and guided it to House passage.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 20 years later, as House Majority Leader, I got an urgent
call one day from President Ronald Reagan. It was the eve of his
scheduled meeting with Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev in Iceland.
Reagan pleaded with Speaker Tip O'Neill and me to intercede with
Democratic members of an ongoing conference committee to restore
specific missile capabilities the House had cut from the military
appropriations bill. Wanting these for bargaining chips, Reagan
confided to us that he'd offer them as inducements for similar
concessions on the part of the Soviet premier. O'Neill and I went
to work to salvage the presidential bargaining position.
</P>
<P>
   These incidents are merely illustrative, by no means unique. For
40 years such cooperation was the rule. Even after his
administration was caught violating laws in Iran-contra, Democratic
leaders were at pains to preserve the personal dignity of President
Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Recent years have seen a painful drift from those days of
bipartisan foreign policy. Ambassadorial and judicial vacancies
often go unfilled for long months while the Senate simply refuses
to act on presidential nominations. United Nations dues, now $1.8
billion in arrears, have gone unpaid for years. These things
embarrass the president and undercut America's moral authority.
They hurt us all.

BUSH TV ADS TOUT EDUCATION, ANTI-TAX RECORD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Republican presidential front-runner George W.
Bush, whose commanding lead is apparently slipping, will kick off a
series of television ads Tuesday in New Hampshire and Iowa, touting
his anti-tax and pro-education record in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The paid TV campaign _ Bush's first in his presidential race _
will herald the Texas governor as a ``compassionate conservative
leader'' and a ``fresh start for America.'' The four ads, which
were previewed for reporters Monday, make no references to any of
his opponents for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also will begin airing one radio commercial in Spanish to
target Hispanics in Iowa, who comprise about 1 percent of the
state's population.
</P>
<P>
   The ads will start running three days after a newspaper poll in
New Hampshire showed Bush was losing ground to Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., among Republican voters in that key nominating state. A
campaign spokesman said the timing was coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   The poll by the Concord Monitor also indicated that Bush could
lose the general election vote in New Hampshire if he and former
Sen. Bill Bradley were the major party nominees.
</P>
<P>
   And a new poll by Newsweek magazine showed Bush's national lead
over Bradley and Democratic front-runner Al Gore narrowing.
</P>
<P>
   In one Bush TV spot, an announcer says the governor has been
``hailed as the Republican Party's best hope to win the White
House.'' The announcer says he signed the ``two largest tax cuts in
Texas history,'' while reducing spending growth, improving
education and reducing the welfare rolls, ``junk'' lawsuits and
juvenile crime.
</P>
<P>
   In the other three commercials, Bush appears on camera to
promise an ``optimistic and very positive'' campaign, to outline
his priorities for education and to promote federal tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The TV ads include video of children of various races in several
settings, elderly people, Bush at bill-signing ceremonies and
hugging his wife, Laura.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign said the television buy was enough to enable
the average person in Iowa and New Hampshire to see the ads about
three to five times a week. Bush aides declined ``for strategic
reasons'' to release other details about the cost and extent of the
buy.
</P>
<P>
   According to the governor's campaign, Bush is the first
presidential candidate, Republican or Democrat, to run Hispanic
media in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new day,'' Bush says in Spanish during the
commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Although one Bush TV spot says the governor has ``reduced the
growth of state government spending to the lowest in 40 years'' in
Texas, Bush already has been attacked over state spending by one of
his Republican opponents, magazine publisher Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   State spending under Bush has increased at a rate of 35 percent,
greater than the 21 percent growth in federal spending during the
past six years of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's budget experts say the growth in spending under Bush
has only been 2.7 percent, when budgetary figures are adjusted for
inflation, population growth and the extra education funds that the
state has transferred to school districts for local property tax
relief.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Democratic Party Chairwoman Molly Beth Malcolm said Bush's
ads did not tell the full story, particularly on the governor's
claim to record tax cuts. Although some school districts have cut
their taxes in recent years, others have raised them, she pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
   According to a New Hampshire poll taken last week and published
Saturday by the Concord Monitor, Bush's lead had shrunk to 39
percent, while former McCain had 27 percent. The other Republican
candidates were in single digits.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar survey in August, Bush led McCain 45 percent to 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Concord Monitor poll, which had a margin of error of plus or
minus 4 percentage points, showed Bush with a 50 percent to 40
percent lead in New Hampshire over Gore in a possible general
election matchup.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush was tied with Bradley at 45 percent to 44 percent. If
Pat Buchanan becomes the Reform party nominee, Bradley would move
ahead of Bush, 45 percent to 41 percent, in New Hampshire, the poll
showed.
</P>
<P>
   Among Republican candidates, McCain and Forbes each have
campaigned in New Hampshire much more often than Bush. And the
Texas governor drew some criticism for skipping the first
presidential debate in New Hampshire last Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   A new national poll by Newsweek, meanwhile, shows Bush's lead
over both Democratic candidates narrowing. According to the survey,
conducted last week with a margin of error of plus or minus 4
percentage points, Bush led Gore, 49 percent to 40 percent, and led
Bradley, 47 percent to 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In a June Newsweek survey, Bush had double-digit leads over both
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The national lineup among Republican candidates in the Newsweek
poll was Bush, 57 percent; McCain, 12 percent, and Forbes, 6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Scott McClellan said that regardless of the
polls, Bush continues to receive ``broad-based support.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He will continue to work hard to earn every single vote,''
McClellan said.

NO DOUBT THAT YANKEES ARE TEAM OF THE CENTURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm rooting for the New York Yankees to win the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   This is clearly a politically incorrect activity in North Texas,
where the Bronx Bombers are considered aliens from another planet
who periodically invade the city of Arlington and devour the
collective heart of the local baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, rooting for the Yankees is politically incorrect just
about everywhere except New York _ and there are parts of New York
where you wouldn't want to be seen wearing a Yankee T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I could say that my fondness for the Yankees reflects
nothing more than my admiration for their manager, Joe Torre; I've
been a Torre fan since his days as a National League batting
champion and Most Valuable player with the St. Louis Cardinals. But
I liked the Yankees long before Torre pulled on those famous
pinstripes.
</P>
<P>
   Having grown up just across the Mississippi River from St.
Louis, I've always been a Cardinal fan. But I started following
baseball at a time when the Redbirds were mired in a decade-long
slump and the Yankees were on top of the world with the likes of
Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris, Whitey Ford, Yogi Berra, Elston Howard.
...
</P>
<P>
   There were no playoffs back then, only the World Series, and the
Yankees always seemed to be playing in the Fall Classic. Most of my
friends hated the Yankees and stubbornly backed the Yanks' opponent
no matter who it was _ even loathsome Cardinal rivals such as the
Dodgers, Giants and Braves. I stuck with Mantle and the Bombers.
</P>
<P>
   They usually rewarded me by winning.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Cardinals and other great teams, the Yankees eventually
ran out of superstars and suffered some down years. But they are a
dominating force these days and the sports pundits are saying that
the current showdown with the Atlanta Braves will determine which
of these two proud franchises will be remembered as the Team of the
'90s.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the Yankees win the 1999 World Series and the
mythical team-of-the-decade designation _ and I predict that they
will _ there can be no disputing this: The team that gave us Babe
Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle was the Team of
the Century.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the statistics, which are breathtaking. Just consider
the transcending presence that the Yankees have always been. When
people around the world of think of baseball, they think of the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   With all due respect to my beloved Cardinals, to those great
Cincinnati and Oakland teams of the '70s and to this would-be
America's Team from Atlanta, there can be no disputing that the
Yankees have defined big-league baseball for most of the 1900s.
More often than not, they have defined it with dignity and
professionalism.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there was that unfortunate vaudeville routine with Billy
Martin and George Steinbrenner in the '70s and '80s and the
unseemly recidivism of Darryl Strawberry in recent years. But
mostly, the Yankees have been a class act.
</P>
<P>
   The classiness of the '99 edition of the team begins with Torre,
who is not only a baseball genius but one of the finest gentlemen
ever to grace a major-league baseball diamond. He was a great
player. He is a great manager.
</P>
<P>
   Torre's team reflects his personality _ so much so that even
chronic troublemaker Strawberry seems to be behaving himself. If
some baseball fans hate the Yankees because they seem arrogant,
well, it's the best brand of arrogance: the serene confidence
produced by winning.
</P>
<P>
   These Yankees know how to win. They never panic. They capitalize
on the opponent's mistakes. They find a way to compensate for their
own mistakes, rare though the mistakes may be.
</P>
<P>
   It's no mystery why the Texas Rangers can't get past the
Yankees, no matter how much talent the local heroes bring to the
quest. The Yankees expect to win and they always find a way to win.
The Rangers expect to lose and they always find a way to lose.
</P>
<P>
   It's the difference between a tradition of winning and a
tradition of losing.
</P>
<P>
   Team of the decade or not, the Yankees are winners. They'll
always be winners.

ESOTERIC SHOPPING RITUALS DESERVE MALES' RESPECT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was just trying to be nice. That's all. It seemed like the
decent thing to do when I inquired of my family, ``Does anyone want
to go shopping with me and my sister today?''
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that I have three males in my family, none of whom
are particularly enthusiastic shoppers. Shopping is not even in my
Top 10 list of things to do, but occasionally the primal urge hits
me and I have to act on it.
</P>
<P>
   So I asked them if they wanted to tag along. Immediately, my
oldest son and my husband said, ``No! Go right ahead. We'll stay
here and watch the game.''
</P>
<P>
   However, my baby boy responded, ``I'll go if I can buy some
Pokemon cards at the mall.''
</P>
<P>
   His father and brother stared at him like he had three eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget the cards,'' his brother advised. ``You don't want to
go shopping with two women. It's horrible. They just talk and talk
and sometimes they don't even buy anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, son,'' my spouse piped in. ``It's not worth it. Not even
for Pokemon cards. You'll get bored and want to come home, but
they'll just keep dragging you from store to store without mercy.
And it takes all day long. You're better off here with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally, I would have protested and set the record straight on
the importance of shopping as evidenced by the very clothes they
were wearing. But I didn't want them to go along anyway so I just
said, ``OK, see you guys later.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon further reflection, I feel it is my duty to let you
non-shoppers have a little insight into the dog-eat-dog world of
mall surfing.
</P>
<P>
   First we have to decide who's going to drive and which mall
we're going to grace with our presence. That can take a good half
hour. Hint: If you have a 16th of a tank of gas, you should not
engage in this debate. Just let the other person drive. Eventually,
we decide on a mall in the next county that has the same stores as
the mall down the street.
</P>
<P>
   Upon our arrival, we go from store to boutique to kiosk,
touching all the pretty, colorful trinkets that we like. We can't
just look at them, we have to pick them up and show our friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at this. Isn't this precious? Stephanie would love this,
it's so her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it is cute. I used to have one but my son sat on it and
broke it. Then he put it back on the end table like nothing had
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   We spend an hour or so touching things before we finally try
something on.
</P>
<P>
   We model for each other and the other women in the dressing room
who all say, ``That is so cute on you, you should buy that. It's so
you.'' We don't purchase anything, but we feel really good about
ourselves now.
</P>
<P>
   Then we have lunch in the food court. So much fun. Talk, talk,
talk. Finally, we get to the really good part. After the eating and
drinking, we have to go to the ladies' room.
</P>
<P>
   I know you men wonder about the ladies' room. We spend a lot of
time in there and the lines are always so long. Well, I'm going to
let you in on a little secret. I may be tarred and feathered for
telling you this, but it's time you knew.
</P>
<P>
   The first part you already know about. We go in, find a stall,
lift the seat with our foot to look for spiders, clean the seat
with a wet wipe even though we're only going to hover over it, and
we handle our business. We discard the first few sheets of toilet
tissue because some strange woman has already touched them, play
tug of war with the spindle for a few more rounds and then we flush
the toilet with our foot.
</P>
<P>
   After that, we wash our hands and go to the party room. Yes, the
party room. Hidden inside the bathrooms of most major department
stores is a full service juice bar and recreation room. Everything
is free. Some women play cards and smoke cigars. Others just go for
a quick chair massage or a table dance by one of the waiters. They
even have arts and crafts classes at some locations. After 10
minutes or so, the hostess kindly reminds us if someone is waiting
on us and we leave reluctantly. Seating is limited, thus the long
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Ladies, forgive me, but they were going to find out sooner or
later.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, that's it. That's why we go shopping all day and come
home with a package of gum.
</P>
<P>
   But do you know what's an even better kept secret? Golfing
outings. Next week, I'll tell you what really happens during those
five hours on the links.

EXHAUSTIVE LOOK AT FLIGHT 800 CRASH WILL HAUNT READERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE COCHRAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget Hannibal Lecter, Dracula, Blair witches and that
ill-tempered shark in ``Jaws.'' This investigative thriller will
scare you to death.
</P>
<P>
   The scenario: The country is on a tense security alert after
receiving classified intelligence reports that the Iranian
government is planning major terrorist attacks against the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. airliner mysteriously explodes and plunges into the
Atlantic, killing all aboard. Eyewitnesses raise the specter of a
missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of the crash, the president has ordered the
``dusting off'' of a military strike plan that will be set in
motion if it is determined that state-sponsored terrorists brought
down the plane.
</P>
<P>
   While the country refines its major retaliatory action, the FBI
launches a sweeping investigation to find the cause of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The most frightening thing about this scenario is that it's
true.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Blink of an Eye'' is the riveting account of the FBI's
marathon investigation of TWA Flight 800, the New York-to-Paris
jumbo jet that crashed three years ago off the coast of Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
   Author Pat Milton, a New York-based Associated Press
correspondent, calls it the most mysterious aviation disaster in
U.S. history. Believe her.
</P>
<P>
   TWA Flight 800 carried 230 people to a horrific death when its
central fuel tank exploded shortly after takeoff from Kennedy
International on the night of July 17, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   There were no survivors. Likewise, there was no hint of trouble
in the moments before the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   The precise cause of the disaster remains a mystery despite an
exhaustive investigation by the FBI, Federal Aviation
Administration, National Transportation Safety Board and Boeing,
which built the doomed 25-year-old 747.
</P>
<P>
   The most haunting aspect of the crash: 270 eyewitness accounts
of a missilelike streak in the sky before the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   A terrorist attack? Friendly fire?
</P>
<P>
   Did a bomb destroy Flight 800? Was it sabotage? Or could it have
been simply a fatal mechanical failure?
</P>
<P>
   In the course of a 16-month, $20 million investigation by
authorities, Milton says more than 700 FBI agents pursued 3,000
leads, interviewed 270 eyewitnesses and conducted 7,000 interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Four hundred divers made more than 4,000 dives to recover a
million-plus pieces of wreckage scattered across the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, experts reconstructed more than 85 percent of the
plane in a hangar at the small farming town of Calverton on the
north shore of Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a dedicated FBI team relentlessly chased down leads,
explored theories and pursued suspects, often while slashing
through political grandstanding, interagency bickering and
bureaucratic nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   The team was headed by Jim Kallstrom, former assistant director
of the FBI, who emerges as a savvy, cool, competent and
compassionate leader.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kallstrom's team failed to pinpoint the exact cause,
Milton reveals, the FBI showed ``with a high degree of certainty
that neither an act of terrorism nor friendly fire brought down the
plane.''
</P>
<P>
   But if not a missile, what did 270 eyewitnesses see that July
evening?
</P>
<P>
   The CIA provided an answer after correlating its accounts with
Flight 800's cockpit recorder and sensors from U.S. spy satellites
that had captured the final explosion of the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CIA,'' Milton explains, ``concluded that the eyewitnesses
had not seen a missile but had witnessed the crippled plane itself
in various stages of breakup after the center fuel tank had
exploded.''
</P>
<P>
   Because sound travels so much slower than light, witnesses saw
streaks of burning debris before hearing the explosion, causing the
misslelike illusion.
</P>
<P>
   Still, among the scariest revelations in Milton's book is the
vulnerability of the U.S. commercial airline industry to acts of
terror or error, which the author relates in chilling detail.
</P>
<P>
   As an AP reporter, Milton followed the story from start to
finish. In her book she writes with the skill and power that comes
only with meticulous research, the respect of the victims' grieving
family members and the hard-won trust of well-placed and highly
credible sources.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, she earned the confidence of Kallstrom and his FBI
colleagues, some of whom shared their most intimate thoughts,
emotions and conclusions with her.
</P>
<P>
   On the first anniversary of the crash, Milton puts Kallstrom on
the beach at Long Island for a memorial ceremony at which he is
reflecting on events of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have worked so hard and come up with no cause, no culprits,
was a great frustration'' to Kallstrom, she writes. ``But there was
something more, something the agents could not fully express but
that Kallstrom understood: In pursuit of the truth, man's love for
his fellow human beings was perhaps the only sure truth that had
been found in this disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Milton calls it ``an ennobling truth, a truth that embraced them
all.''

`Y2K': IT'S COMING AND STOCK UP ON GOOD HUMOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(ms) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   So will the turn of the millennium mean a blip or a glitz or a
monumental mess for America? Robert X. Cringely, the PBS specialist
on nerdism, is the latest investigator to address the question. In
``Y2K: The Winter of Our Disconnect,'' he chats with officials,
computer know-it-alls and ``survivalists'' and comes up with more
reasons for indifference than for panic.
</P>
<P>
   Using the breakdown of his car, perhaps owing to a computer
failure, as a pretext, he traces the Year 2000 problem to
programmers past who relied on two-digit dates to save
computer-chip space. That, as most viewers must know by now, means
that when our calendars change from 1999 to 2000, the computers
will register ``00,'' which since history is not their strong
point, they will interpret as 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Cringely assures us that many essential everyday services like
traffic lights, garbage collection and 911 calls, which do not
depend on ambiguous computer dating, will not be affected in the
slightest. And he reports that matters like national defense,
nuclear safety and hydroelectric power are in the hands of
engineers, not computer whizzes. So don't worry.
</P>
<P>
   Where Year 2000 is likely to cause snags, he finds, is on the
accounting front or its back rooms. Computer programs for matters
like reimbursing Medicare charges or collecting bills may resist
quick fixes.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for some group to blame for your checks being
delayed or getting lost, Cringely's candidates are the ``software
centrists,'' who, instead of improving the dependability of the
basic computers, have always preferred to tinker with the
individual programs. Solving immediate problems is easier in the
short run than getting at the heart of what's wrong, and by now
every piecemeal change involves many other changes that programmers
don't even remember, so their efforts to adjust matters to suit the
millennial change could bring unanticipated confusions.
</P>
<P>
   Cringely does not suggest that viewers join those fretful folks
he interviews who are already stocking up on granola and ammunition
and thinking about heading for the mountains to escape catastrophe.
But we should all expect some mix-ups and delays involving checks,
bills, credit charges and other quotidian calculations. The advice
he leaves us with, as he drives off in his newly repaired car, is
to be patient and neighborly: ``Enjoy the millennium!''

CULTURAL REVOLUTIONARY EXPLAINS `ART FOR DUMMIES'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
UNDATED: character, marketing ploy. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``For the fresco show, I tried to get the Fresca soft-drink
company to sponsor it,'' Hoving says with a laugh. ``They really
didn't have a clue what I was getting at, what the connection was,
and why should they? But I figured the name was so close they could
have done something with it. They politely turned me down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Great Age of Tapestries'' followed the fresco exhibit. In
retrospect, both paled next to Hoving's last great orchestration:
``The Treasures of Tutankhamen.'' The two-year show featured the
breathtaking gold, glass and lapis lazuli collars, bracelets and
headdresses from the mummies' tomb. The exhibit attracted millions
and, ever the showman, Hoving relished knowing that in terms of
ticket sales, no other exhibit ever surpassed King Tut. It would
cap Hoving's 10 years at the Met.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until Tom Hoving arrived, museums were operated as citadels of
very sophisticated culture, which meant they were really sleepy
cupboards,'' says Edmund Pillsbury, former director of the Kimbell
Art Museum. ``But because of his incredible skills as scholar,
impresario and salesman, he made people feel that the museum was a
place for everybody. Now, no one would ever describe Thomas Hoving
as a great diplomat, but his energy and vision alone qualify him as
one of the major figures in the history of American museums.''
</P>
<P>
   The lofty status accorded to Hoving lends a definite weight to
any prognosis he makes on museum growth. Right now, his crystal
ball doesn't present an optimistic picture. ``Unfortunately, the
museum audience is dwindling because museums are finding, to their
horror, that their well-educated patrons are also rapidly aging
people,'' Hoving says. ``To get the 6-year-old there, you might
need Ricky Martin to do a lecture on Spanish painting.''
</P>
<P>
   A museum's salvation, according to Hoving, lies in a shrewd
manipulation of its own collection, turning it like a Rubik's Cube
until the most felicitous combination emerges. What is clear to
Hoving is that recycling predictable shows won't cut it any longer.
``So many museums really can't do yet another blockbuster
Impressionism show,'' says Hoving. ``They should just plumb their
own collections, telling marvelous stories about what they already
have.''
</P>
<P>
   OK. Then, suddenly, Hoving shifts into Knute Rockne mode,
exhorting museums everywhere to heed his advice. ``C'mon, you guys
in charge of museums, give us a little imagination in what you are
showing,'' he says, as if leading a pep rally. ``Don't just show us
yet another fifth-ranked late Renaissance collection or something
on the great masters where most of the works can never leave their
home galleries. I mean, I just saw the Van Dyck show at the Royal
Academy in London, and the three greatest works weren't there, so
why bother?''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Hoving may be writing for the masses, but when he visits
an art gallery, he is still one demanding connoisseur.

   SPEND-CONGRESS (Washington) _ President Clinton vetoed his third
spending bill today, the bill paying for the Commerce, State and
Justice departments. At the same time he signed into law a $268
billion military spending bill, avoiding the potential of a
crippling split among Democrats as the parties hurtle toward the
finale of their budget showdown. By Alison Mitchell.

   PLANE-STEWART (Undated) _ A Learjet carrying golfer Payne
Stewart and four other people flew uncontrolled over the nation's
heartland for hours Monday before crashing in South Dakota, killing
everyone aboard. The twin-engine plane, which took off from
Orlando, Fla., may have suffered a pressurization failure during
its scheduled flight to Dallas, government officials said. (Summary

   BUCHANAN-REFORM (Falls Church, Va.) _ Invoking a ``new
patriotism,'' Pat Buchanan put aside a lifetime of Republican
fervor Monday and shifted his lagging presidential quest to a run
for the Reform party nomination. And as soon as he did, he was
attacked by Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican front-runner
considered most liable to damage should Buchanan generate a serious
tri-corner competition. By Francis X. Clines.

   GAZA-WESTBANK (Erez Crossing, Gaza Strip) _ The first safe
passage route between Gaza and the West Bank opened Monday,
re-establishing a lifeline between the divided portions of the
Palestinian world. The opening marked another concrete step forward
in the Israeli-Palestinian peace effort, but its delay hinted at
the difficulties that lie ahead as Prime Minister Ehud Barak aims

   IDAHO-INDIANS (Salmon, Idaho) _ The Lemhi Shoshone, living links
to the teenage girl who was instrumental in leading the Corps of
Discovery over the continental divide in 1805, have been all but
erased from this place they have called home for hundreds of years.
But the tribe's luck may be about to change. Spurred on by an
extraordinary surge of interest in the journey of Lewis and Clark,
hoopla over a new dollar coin honoring Sacajawea, and recent
scholarly finds that bolster Lemhi legal claims, the Indians have
asked President Clinton to carve out a small piece of federal land
in the Salmon River country on the Idaho-Montana border as a place
where the tribe can tell their story to the hordes of Lewis and
Clark history buffs, honor their dead, and try to stitch some of
the past to the present. By Timothy Egan.

<P>
   GORE-BRADLEY (Washington) _ Vice President Al Gore and former
Sen. Bill Bradley have a lot more in common than either would like
to admit to presidential primary voters. Each will try to emphasize
differences that matter to those voters when they debate for the
first time in New Hampshire on Wednesday night. But in fact, the
two Democrats have spent the bulk of thlic service careers
as generally liberal members of Congress, with a quite similar
approach to the job. By Adam Clymer.

FISHING LUCK RUNS DRY IN STEELHEAD TERRITORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM STIENSTRA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALONG THE DESCHUTES RIVER, Ore. _ With each cast of my fly rod,
the river seemed full of hope, challenge and reward.
</P>
<P>
   I worked my way thigh deep across from a riffle, then whipped
the line back-and-forth twice and delivered it gently into the run,
mended the line quickly, then let the fly drift down the edge of
the white water. Everything was just right, a perfect spot. A big
steelhead must be here, I thought, maybe several.
</P>
<P>
   The river was brisk, the morning air sharp, and there were light
tingles on my neck, both from the chill and the excitement. Above
the volcanic basalt canyon walls, an osprey was also out at first
light, hoping for a fish.
</P>
<P>
   I lifted my rod and cast again. Nothing. But that's how it can
be for steelhead. What drives you is hope, that the fish of your
life always seems to be just ahead, perhaps to be hooked on your
next cast.
</P>
<P>
   This was on the Deschutes River in Oregon, which starts as a
trickle at the south flank of the Three Sisters Wilderness in the
Cascade Range, then winds its way for 200 miles out of the
mountains, past dams, and eventually through the Oregon desert
country and into the Columbia River. It is one of the North
America's renowned steelhead streams, producer of the state-record
28-pounder, attracting anglers from across the Western United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers of steelhead in the Columbia system right now are
out of this world,'' said Ed Rice, who organized the trip. ``The
rivers are loaded with them, three times as many as last year,
according to the counts at Bonneville Dam. This could be the best
steelhead trip of your life.''
</P>
<P>
   The steelhead defines the challenge. It is the fastest
freshwater fish of them all, with a burst speed of 27 feet per
second. Hooking, fighting and landing a big one on a fly rod while
wading from shore is not only a preeminent fishing challenge, but
can just plain flip your pancake. The Deschutes is an outstanding
steelhead river for flyfishers because it is filled with
basketball-size boulders in water 3 to 6 feet deep, the ultimate
habitat and casting water.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for this trip started last spring at the International
Sportsmen's Exposition, where two of the finest flyfishers in the
world, Gary Borger and Rice, were giving seminars and invited me to
join them for a trip: ``The best of the best,'' Rice called the
adventure. Eager to join as well was Charlie Meyers _ an outdoors
writer from Colorado with whom I first fished 20 years ago in the
Caribbean Sea _ each of us catching world-record Atlantic bonito on
back-to-back casts.
</P>
<P>
   Rice has caught and released a world-best 165 species of
sportfish on a fly rod and could approach 200 after a trip to
several countries in Africa next month; that includes all the
marlin species except for blue marlin _ a 600-pounder he hooked two
years ago broke the line. Borger comes from the same fabric, having
invented, among many creations, his own fly line: ``Borger's Shadow
Line,'' and being hired by Robert Redford as the consultant for his
movie, ``A River Runs Through It.'' The flycasting scenes in that
movie are not actors Brad Pitt and Craig Scheffer, but actually
Borger's son, Jason, filmed from a distance.
</P>
<P>
   Rice joked that he didn't want to be paired with Borger, at
least not the first day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call him `Hoover,''' Rice explained, ``because if you let
him fish in front of you, he vacuums up everything and leaves
nothing behind.''
</P>
<P>
   In minutes we had landed the boat and jumped out. The rush of
cold water whirled past my waders as I tied on a fly, a skunk
pattern with a laser-sharp hook, and started casting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks really good,'' I said aloud, really to no one, just
talking to the river and the towering stark canyon walls.
</P>
<P>
   Rice had warned me that steelhead on the Deschutes ``hit like a
freight train,'' and to ``always keep a loop of line in your rod
hand, so you have some line to give the fish.'' Otherwise, he
explained, during the ``savage strike,'' the hook can be
unintentionally ripped out of the fish's mouth. Worse yet, Rice
continued, if your line accidentally loops around your reel and
gets caught in a fixed position, an occasional problem when fly
fishing, ``the steelhead will rip the rod right out your hands and
into the river and it's goodbye rod.'' That charged the excitement
even more.
</P>
<P>
   By that evening, we had fished five miles of river, splitting up
in different boats, fishing different spots. At camp that night, on
a plateau sprinkled with sagebrush above the river bank, we
compared notes. So far, nothing. Most fishermen are born dishonest,
but Rice, Borger and Meyers seem to have gotten over it.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, after a camp breakfast, we were all again eager
and excited to get our first fish. I wondered if I could handle one
with just 125 yards of backing line _ every one else had 200 to 250
yards of line on their reels. After all, ``these steelhead can
really fly,'' Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   But that night, comparing notes, it turned out we'd all been
skunked again.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, can you believe there is a chance we might get
zeroed on this trip?'' I asked Meyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you just figure that out?'' he answered.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody believed it.
</P>
<P>
   I started watching Rice and Borger in action. Each is a true
artist of the craft, their fly rods like brushes, the stream a
canvas, as they paint a scene that Redford managed to capture on
film. After a 45-minute sequence, where Borger worked a 150-yard
seam in the river with his full palate of colors, stepping
downstream a measured foot after each cast for full stream
coverage, he finally turned his back and walked out of the river.
</P>
<P>
   I watched him as he approached, head down, shoulders slumped,
utterly defeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing,'' he said, then stopped. ``You?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   On the final day, suddenly all seemed hopeful again. That
afternoon, I was with Rice, the master, and we were working what
seemed a perfect 100-yard run, ideal holding water, a V-wedge seam
along white water. I had a grab, and though the fish wasn't hooked,
it seemed the river fortunes were finally ours to take.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, from well downstream, Rice let out a howling yell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Got him! got him!''
</P>
<P>
   A moment later, there was another howl, and the river guide,
Bryce Tedford, went sprinting down the river bank to watch the
commotion. I slogged my way to shore, and then in minutes, arrived
at the scene, ready to see Rice break the Curse of the Deschutes.
</P>
<P>
   But Rice, a big man, was not smiling, though his rod was still
bending. In fact, he looked something like an exasperated grizzly
bear. Just 30 feet downstream in the current, right on the surface,
was a fish on its side, not a steelhead, but a sucker, a non-game
coarse fish, that Rice had accidentally snagged in the dorsal fin,
and was dragging in.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as we left the river, we compared histories, and none of
us had ever had a trip like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever seen that many quality people so intense for a
fish that didn't exist?'' Borger said.

 &HT;    Women's hormones a complex web
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dr. Elizabeth Lee Vliet will discuss how women's
hormones can be both ``marvelous and maddening'' at a Thursday
conference sponsored by Northside Hospital. Vliet is the author of
the book ``Screaming to Be Heard: Hormonal Connections Women
Suspect and Doctors Ignore.'' Staff writer Patricia Guthrie
recently caught up with Vliet as she shuttled between her women's
health centers in Tucson and Dallas-Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Your book goes into great depth on all the different ways a
woman is affected by estrogen and the hormonal changes throughout a
lifetime. What motivated you to compile such information?
</P>
<P>
   A:From listening to women describing their experiences with
menstrual periods and hormonal changes during menopause. The
information for them was not integrated into a cohesive picture as
to how all the pieces fit together. There has been more research
done on menopause in the international medical community than in
this country.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Hot flashes, weight gain and mood swings are the usual
physical and emotional effects women are told to expect during
menopause. But there's much more, correct?
</P>
<P>
   A:More than 400 functions are affected by estradiol released
from the ovaries. Most women tend to think of their ovaries
relating only to reproduction and menstruation. They don't see
their hormones as a metabolic function that can affect everything
from glucose regulation, muscle repair, brain function and nerve
cells. There really does tend to be a lack of recognition of all
these effects (by doctors), because women's bodily chemical changes
have not been the focus of medical research in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What health problems could a menopausal woman be experiencing
that she may not suspect are hormone-related?
</P>
<P>
   A:Fatigue, mood changes, memory loss, headaches, cholesterol
changes, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   Q:The decision to take hormone replacement therapy seems
emotional for many women, because of breast cancer fears. What do
you tell your patients ?
</P>
<P>
   A:It's actually a decision that can be made very logically. The
problem is it's been approached by the media with much more
emphasis on the breast cancer risk than the other health risks that
come from not taking hormone replacement therapy, such as migraine
headaches, bone loss and heart disease. ... The other problem is
we've used a cookbook approach when it comes to hormone
replacement, giving the same two drugs _ Premarin or Provera _ and
same dose to all women. I don't think we would give men the same
drug and dose for heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Registration for Vliet's lecture is full. But Northside Hospital
is sponsoring a continuing series on women's midlife issues on
Mondays in November. Free seminars are scheduled 7:30-9 p.m. this
Monday(hormone replacement therapy), Nov. 8 (alternatives to
hormone replacement), Nov. 15 (women and heart disease), Nov. 22

FRANCE JOINS U.S. IN A PUSH FOR MIDSIZE MUSEUMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Texas, Minn., Mass., Va., Ore., Mo., Calif., Conn.,
France)  (js) 
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LYON, France _ Their buildings, collections and traditions may
be very different, but regional museums in France and the United
States have at least one thing in common: acute awareness that
Americans usually visit museums in Paris, that French tourists head
for museums in New York and that museums in medium-size cities in
both countries are all too often overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in an attempt to demonstrate that cultural life also exists
outside Paris and New York, nine French and nine U.S. regional
museums are joining forces to raise their profiles. As an initial
step, they have agreed to share know-how on new technology,
marketing and fund-raising and, more critically, to start
exchanging masterpieces and developing joint exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   It is proving to be a voyage of discovery. Before the first
meeting of museum directors here this month, they exchanged
catalogs because in most cases they did not know one another's
collections. During their visit to Lyons, several Americans even
met fellow directors from other American museums for the first
time. And before their next meeting in St. Louis next October, both
French and Americans plan to cross the Atlantic to visit their new
partners.
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of their relative isolation that the initiative
for this program came from an outsider, Elizabeth Rohatyn, whose
husband, Felix, is the U.S. ambassador to France. Richard Bretell,
former director of the Dallas Museum of Art, was then brought in to
coordinate the U.S. museums, while Francoise Cachin, director of
the French museums department, selected the French participants.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. museums involved are the Cleveland Museum of Art, the
Dallas Museum of Art, the Minneapolis Institute of Art, the
Portland Art Museum in Oregon, the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in
Richmond, the St. Louis Art Museum, the Fine Arts Museum of San
Francisco, the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in
Williamstown, Mass., and the Yale University Art Gallery and Yale
Center for British Art. The French fine arts museums in the program
are those of Bordeaux, Grenoble, Lille, Lyons, Montpellier, Rennes,
Rouen, Strasbourg and Toulouse.
</P>
<P>
   The chosen museums well illustrate the contrasting French and
American approaches to culture. Most of the nine French museums
were created by Napoleon in 1801 and all are still owned and
financed by city governments. In contrast, the U.S. museums were in
the main founded as independent institutions and depend on
fund-raising. Similarly, while the French museums often have
something of a regional identity, the U.S. museums generally aspire
to be universal.
</P>
<P>
   Yet both sides are eager to find common ground. At a workshop on
collection sharing and joint exhibitions, French and American
directors began suggesting works or shows that they could offer and
mentioning exhibition themes that interested them. They clearly
felt it important that some joint projects take place before their
next meeting even though museums generally plan their large
exhibitions at least two years in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their shared interest in appealing to new audiences,
they were disinclined to take the easy path of organizing yet
another exhibition of, say, Impressionist paintings. ``We have a
duty to do more than that,'' said Evan M. Maurer, director and
president of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts. Michael Conforti,
director of the Clark Art Institute, added: ``There must be an
intellectual basis for exchanges.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Next year the Musee des Beaux-Arts of Lille will lend a
collection of Raphael drawings to Cleveland and St. Louis, while
Cleveland and the Musee des Beaux-Arts in Lyons will temporarily
unite their Zurbaran masterpieces. Lille, Minneapolis and the Clark
Art Institute will also reunite their panels of a famous early
15th-century triptych by an anonymous Flemish painter known as the
Master of Embroidered Foliage.
</P>
<P>
   More ambitious plans lie ahead. For 2001 Maurer will organize
``Sacred Symbols: 2,000 Years of North American Indian Art,'' which
will travel to museums in Lyons, Rouen and Lille.
</P>
<P>
   The Grenoble, Lyons and Strasbourg museums will in turn organize
a show of French painting since 1945 for display at Cleveland,
while French medieval art from Lille, Strasbourg and Toulouse will
visit Cleveland and Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides are also keen to develop a group identity. One
idea is to create a common Internet platform for the 18 museums as
both an informational and educational instrument; another is to use
multimedia to create ``virtual exhibitions'' of works that are too
fragile to be moved. The partnership should also open the way for
the exchange of curators and joint research projects.

 &HT;    Payne wants `to be left alone,' wife says
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant

<TEXT>
<P>
   Under siege from the media and a congressional committee
investigating the Olympic Games scandal, Billy Payne tells his side
of the story to Atlanta ($3.50) writer Rebecca Poynor Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Payne insists that nothing will tarnish the Olympic experience
for him and other Georgians. ``Down the stream, when you ask what
was Georgia's finest hour, you're going to get an overwhelming
response that it was the Olympic Games.'' So what does Payne want?
According to his wife, Martha, ``What he wants, really, is to be
left alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Also of note: Interior designer Monique Gibson takes readers on
a tour of Elton John's Park Place pad in Atlanta. Artwork and
photography fill nearly every wall, thousands of CDs are cataloged
and stored, and a hand-woven tiger velvet spread sets the tone in
John's bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The word on mummies: National Geographic ($4) gives the public
its first comprehensive look at the haunting photographs of the
Inca mummies discovered this spring on a mountain in Argentina. The
two girls and a boy _ sacrifices to the Inca gods _ were found
along with a cache of textiles and artifacts in a burial platform
atop Mount Llullaillaco. Buried under rock and earth, the frozen
bodies were so well preserved they appeared as if they had just
been buried. Such sacrifices were rare, says explorer Johan
Reinhard, and children were used because they were considered purer
than adults.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The guns of Waco: New Yorker ($3) correspondent Peter J. Boyer
sifts through the ashes (figuratively) of the Branch Davidian
compound to get to the bottom of what appears to be a massive
coverup. One of the key questions is whether FBI agents fired their
guns at the Branch Davidians. The agency denies any shots were
fired, but a congressional committee is considering ballistics
tests on the dozen .38-caliber bullets whose casings were found at
an FBI sniper site.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  End of the world: An apocalypse of another sort is the subject
of Newsweek's ($3.50) cover story this week. Reporters Kenneth L.
Woodward and John Leland examine the biblical prophecies and the
stream of books and Internet traffic about the final days.
According to a Newsweek poll, some 40 percent of adults in the
world, including the congregation at the New Hope Revival Church in
Columbus, believe the world will end in a battle of Armageddon
between Jesus and the Antichrist.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The meat of the matter: Apparently you can have your steak and
eat it, too. Time ($3.50) examines the low-carb diet trend of
feasting on beef, bacon and eggs to lose weight. A helpful chart
compares the various plans, from the Atkins Diet to Weight
Watchers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  All that jazz: Doubletake ($10) has a new staff and a new
address in Boston, but the magazine formerly published by Duke
University's Center for Documentary Studies is as lively and classy
as ever. The fall issue features Life photographer W. Eugene
Smith's never-before published pictures of a loft in New York's
flower district 40 years ago. The photographs brilliantly capture
the jazz era between 1957 and 1964, when musical greats Thelonius
Monk, Zoot Sims and Stan Getz would come to 821 Sixth Ave. for
after-hours jam sessions. Smith wisely recorded hundreds of hours
of the sessions on reel-to-reel tape.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Quitters who win: Contrary to what our parents may have told
us, staying on the same job until you retire doesn't work anymore.
At least that's what U.S. News &AMP; World Report ($3.50) found in a
survey of the current worker-shortage job market. Those who remain
loyal to employers usually are stuck with raises of 4 percent or
less. As Atlantan Chuck Dressler discovered, the best way to get
ahead is to quit. Dressler had worked as a bartender at Red Lobster
for less than two years when headhunters called and lured him away
to Mick's for $10,000 more.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Undressed Net: Men who are embarrassed to go into lingerie
shops will be relieved to know they can view _ and purchase _
feminine undergarments online. The new Yahoo! ($3.98) provides an
intimate guide to the best places to buy lingerie and other
fashions on the Internet. The bad news: You still have to know your
significant other's correct size.

SCHWARZ TO QUIT AFTER 17 YEARS AS LEADER OF MOSTLY MOZART 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a move that Lincoln Center officials say caught
them by surprise, Gerard Schwarz has said that he will relinquish
the music directorship of the Mostly Mozart Festival when his
contract ends in 2001. Schwarz, who became the festival's first
music director in 1984 after two years as its music adviser, said
on Sunday that he had told Nathan Leventhal, president of Lincoln
Center, on Wednesday about his desire to leave the festival.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz, 52, said in an interview that when his current contract
ends he will have been at the festival for 20 years and that he
wanted to devote himself more fully to his directorships of the
Seattle Symphony and the New York Chamber Symphony, as well as to
composing and arranging. Although he has maintained a home in New
York, he has become increasingly involved in the musical and civic
life of Seattle during his 17-year association with the orchestra
there. As music director of Mostly Mozart, he conducted the
festival's orchestra and oversaw its choice of programs in
consultation with Lincoln Center's programming department.
</P>
<P>
   Leventhal said yesterday that he was ``surprised and also
disappointed, because we were coming off a really strong season in
which the orchestra was playing, by all accounts, better than it
ever has.'' He said that Lincoln Center had not started to search
for a successor. In a letter dated Friday, Leventhal asked Schwarz
to accept the title conductor emeritus ``to signify what I am
confident will be your continued association with Lincoln Center
for many years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz said, ``I've been thinking about leaving Mostly Mozart
for a while, because I've been doing it a lot of years.'' He
continued: ``When I was hired as music advisor and later music
director, my charge was to expand the repertory _ because the
festival at that time had not even played all the Mozart piano
concertos _ as well as to make the orchestra cohesive and bring it
some international fame. I feel I've accomplished that.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been credited with upgrading the freelance orchestra,
partly by bringing in members of his New York Chamber Symphony. He
also transformed what had become a formulaic festival in the early
1980's, by incorporating concert operas, rarely heard arrangements
of Mozart works by 20th-century composers and even some
20th-century examples of Neo-Classicism.
</P>
<P>
   But his role at Mostly Mozart has also been diminished
considerably in recent years, starting with cutbacks in the Mostly
Mozart schedule to accommodate the more expansive Lincoln Center
Festival, which began in 1996. Schwarz fought against the cutbacks
and lost, as Mostly Mozart was reduced from seven weeks to four.
</P>
<P>
   More recently Lincoln Center's programming department, directed
by Jane S. Moss, has taken greater control of the festival's
programming, giving a greater emphasis to guest ensembles and
period-instrument bands and reducing the visibility of the Mostly
Mozart Festival Orchestra. Last summer Ms. Moss said that Schwarz
fully endorsed these changes, and he did not argue the point. But
of the season's 19 programs, only 8 were performed by the festival
orchestra, and of those, Schwarz conducted only 3, including the
opening and closing concerts.
</P>
<P>
   Both Schwarz and Leventhal denied that frictions over
programming led to Schwarz's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's what it is,'' Schwarz said. ``This summer I took the
Mostly Mozart orchestra on its ninth tour of Japan, and when I got
back, it was time to begin the season in Seattle. There was not a
lot of time for reflection, for studying scores.''
</P>
<P>
   Leventhal said he was discussing the question of Schwarz's
successor with Ms. Moss and Beverly Sills, the chairman of Lincoln
Center, but that no one had been approached.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly don't know what form the search will take,''
Leventhal said. ``He was our first music director, so we've never
done a search before. There's no precedent. But Mostly Mozart is an
important priority for this institution, it's one of our most
popular programs. We'll want to cast our net widely and consider
everyone who is appropriate.''

   LOS ANGELES _ When is a Halloween concert not a Halloween
concert? When playing a concert of Hitchcock film music is a
``thematic excuse'' to play some terrific,
never-before-heard-in-concert music, says Hollywood Bowl Orchestra
conductor John Mauceri. Mauceri and the orchestra are performing
indoors Wednesday at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion for only the
second time since the ensemble's formation in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a concert of `scary music,' '' said Mauceri, who
seems to be in constant motion, even when he's not on the podium.
``What really makes (the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra) unique in the
world is our mission to explore and perform the cultural
achievements of Los Angeles. And what's particularly exciting about
this concert,'' Mauceri added, ``is I think 85 percent of this
music we're playing is being played for the very first time here in
Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, you may think you're familiar with the music to
``Psycho'' _ particularly the distinctive screeching played at the
movie's horrifying climax. But Bernard Herrmann's original score
has never been performed in its entirety before. Mauceri was set to
receive a copy of the original manuscript over the weekend; his
crackerjack orchestra, made up mainly of musicians who make their
living recording film and TV soundtracks, needs only a few
rehearsals to play it like the seasoned pros they are.
</P>
<P>
   After seven years of never making an appearance at the Music
Center, the Bowl orchestra is playing its first two subscription
concerts there this year: this one and a Valentine's Day-themed
concert on Feb. 9. The concerts _ packaged in new, three-event
``Rendezvous'' series with concerts by the Los Angeles Philharmonic
and the Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra _ are designed for
``audiences new to classical music,'' according to the Phil's
season brochure. The groupings were the idea of former managing
director Willem Wijnbergen, who departed abruptly several months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hollywood Bowl Orchestra is a `first point of entry,'''
explains Bowl orchestra manager Steve Linder. ``It allows people to
be exposed to classical music, to discover it. We're not
`Philharmonic Lite,' though. The Hitchock concert is serious music,
even though we don't like that term: `serious.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Mauceri also is passionate about the fact that the film music of
Los Angeles is important and underrated. ``The `Los Angeles sound'
in this music is a natural development of European music from the
first quarter of this century that continued unabated without any
interference from the arbiters of `serious music' in New York,''
Mauceri says. ``Classical music organizations have shunned this
music,'' Mauceri says. ``The reasons are bound up in complex
political and racial issues, which are too complex to get into
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The nice thing about film music, though, is one doesn't have to
analyze such things if one doesn't want to. Whether you're going to
enjoy the unique, European-grounded ``Los Angeles sound,'' or
simply to re-create movie scenes in your head while listening to
wonderful music, you're sure to enjoy yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very broad, very smart audience. In fact,'' says
Mauceri, who has guest-conducted around the world, ``I think
they're the smartest audience I've ever played to. This summer, we
played to 250,000 people. They're not shunning other types of
music; they've made a conscious choice as to what music they like
to hear.'' &QL; 
___ &UR;  &QL;

featuring film music by Bernard Herrmann, Dmitri Tiomkin, Franz
Waxman and others. &UR;  &QL;

   CLARKSDALE, Miss. _ Driving into this sleepy upper Delta city
toward the crossroads where Highway 49 meets Highway 61, the first
thing one sees is a sign that boasts ``Clarksdale: Home of the Big
Frog.'' There is little mention that Clarksdale is famous for more
than amphibians: It is probably the most legendary blues site in
the South. Dozens of blues legends were born or lived in this city
or its county, Coahoma, among them John Lee Hooker, Muddy Waters,
Charley Patton, Pinetop Perkins, Son House and W.C. Handy. Nearly
every Delta blues musician of note performed in Clarksdale
regularly, including Robert Johnson, Howlin' Wolf and Sonny Boy
Williamson. And many of them died here, most notably Bessie Smith.
To this day a visitor arriving on a lucky night can see a venerable
musician rocking the barroom at one of the dozen crumbling juke
joints downtown.
</P>
<P>
   More than the blues came to life in Clarksdale: The soul singer
Sam Cooke grew up here, as did Ike Turner and Jackie Brenston, who
recorded what some credit as the first rock 'n' roll song, ``Rocket
88.'' Local legend has it that a young Elvis Presley used to come
through and hang around the radio station (home to one of the
country's first black disk jockeys) in hopes of getting a chance to
sing on the air.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, however, the only people who recognized the city's
heritage were the international blues tourists who trickled in each
year. There was little for them to see: a small, homey annual blues
festival and a Delta Blues Museum tucked into the Carnegie Library
there. The county had already let the House of Blues, the music
club chain, dismantle the shack Muddy Waters once lived in and cart
it off on a national tour.
</P>
<P>
   But something strange has happened in Clarksdale the last year
or two. As if awakening from amnesia, many whites here have
suddenly become aware of the town's blues heritage. Much of this is
owed to a handful of unusual characters: John Ruskey, a blues fan
who came floating down the Mississippi River on a raft from
Memphis, landing in Clarksdale to stay; a home builder named
Kinchen O'Keefe, better known as Bubba, who funneled his savings
into creating a mini-tourism empire downtown; a former
schoolteacher, Molly Shields, who found a way to keep her aging
boyfriend off the dangerous power lines he works on by opening what
she calls a ``blues pawn shop.'' There are Cathy and James Butler,
who decided to subvert the legacy of the Hopson Plantation,
inherited from Mrs. Butler's forebears, by renting out the
sharecropper's shacks and turning the company store into a social
club. Each has been trying to build a bridge to the city's cultural
past, and one result may be to take Clarksdale into the next
century as one of the South's most irresistible tourist meccas.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as O'Keefe said, ``We've got gold in the stream that needs
mining.''
</P>
<P>
   With the new casinos in nearby Tunica County bringing in over 1
million visitors a year, Clarksdale _ which was a stop on President
Clinton's four-day poverty tour this summer _ has experienced the
impact that tourism can have on an economy. It has invested several
million dollars into developing an area it calls Blues Alley
(complete with a John Lee Hooker Lane) and it is working on putting
its atrophied bus and train stations in order, partly to lure some
of the tourists visiting Tunica and Memphis to the north.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to keep the tourists in town for longer than
30 minutes,'' said Butler, who in addition to helping run Hopson is
also the city's director of public works. ``But the one thing I
feel everybody's kept in their minds is that things can't get too
clean and flashy. Keep it real or we won't have what we have now.''
</P>
<P>
   Clarksdale first came to life in the late 1800s as a lumber camp
established by John Clark, whose daughter, Blanche, inspired the
character of the same name in ``A Streetcar Named Desire'' by
Tennessee Williams, who also made his home in Clarksdale. With the
advent of railways, Clarksdale blossomed in the early 20th century,
becoming one of the most prosperous cities of its size in the
nation and known as ``little New York'' because of all its
millionaires. The city was where the majority black population came
to shop, celebrate and listen to music on days off. But with World
War II and the mechanization of the cotton industry, the city's
population ebbed as sharecroppers moved to cities in the North, and
bankruptcy abounded. Today Clarksdale has been cited as one of the
poorest cities in the poorest state in the nation, with 30 percent
of Clarksdale's residents below the poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   One of the city's acknowledged treasures for over 20 years has
been the Delta Blues Museum. But last year the museum's director
died, and a successor has not been appointed. Ruskey, a curator who
had left the museum to work as a river guide, stepped in to take
care of museum business along with Mae Smith, who ran the gift
shop. They helped reopen the Delta Blues Museum on Oct. 10 in a
beautifully remodeled freight station bought by the city in Blues
Alley.
</P>
<P>
   On opening day, visitors wandered through three rooms of
temporary exhibitions, including a wax figure of Muddy Waters, a
headstone that once stood on Mississippi Fred McDowell's grave (it
had been replaced because his name was misspelled), photographs of
blues legends and dozens of other displays chronicling the history
of blues and soul in the Delta.
</P>
<P>
   On a concrete stage out by the old train tracks, local
musicians, including Ruskey and many teen-agers who were taught to
play by the museum's blues education fund (most notably the group
J.T. Express, favorites at nearby juke joints like the Do Drop
Inn), performed for the small crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The bluesman and museum teacher Johnnie Billington, who closed
the show, walked around in the sweltering afternoon in a coat and
tie. Since instructing his students to always dress formally in
public so that they will be treated with respect, he has never been
seen otherwise, residents say, even when mowing his yard on a
sweltering summer afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   A block and a half from the museum festivities, O'Keefe stood
behind the counter in his new store, the Sunflower River Trading
Company, surrounded by the local crafts, music and videos he was
selling. With the boarded-up, discolored and dilapidated
storefronts around it, the store looks like a rose that somehow
sprouted from quicksand. Like many others here, O'Keefe has a story
about growing up in blues country without ever being a part of it.
``Mississippi Fred McDowell used to pump gas for my father,'' he
said. ``He used to go to festivals in Europe, then come back and
pump gas.''
</P>
<P>
   Now O'Keefe has embarked on a one-man publicity and renovation
campaign for Clarksdale. Across the street from his new store he
bought the building that once housed WROX radio. He turned the
ground floor into a children's store and the top floor into a
professional-looking dance studio for local children, including his
own. Between those floors are the empty radio studios where a young
Elvis Presley used to pay the owner money to sing on the air, Ike
Turner worked as a janitor and Sam Cooke was a protege of the disk
jockey Early Wright, the Soul Man. That part of the building, he
said, will become a museum and studio celebrating the station's
glory days. He also plans to build the city's first cafe in the
building and to organize package tours of the area.
</P>
<P>
   Several blocks away Ms. Shields and Brower opened one of the
city's odder attractions in June. Brower was working on the city's
power lines when they decided to find a different line of work. So
they opened Carmen's Blues Pawn Shop (named after Brower's
daughter) downtown, where they also sell tourist souvenirs like
autographed CD's by newer area blues acts like Super Chikan, key
chains, and T-shirts. On the wall outside, their nephews have
painted the city's first blues mural: giant caricatures of John Lee
Hooker, Bessie Smith and Muddy Waters.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shields said she was brought up in Clarksdale but never knew
how famous her home was in blues lore until recently. ``We get
people from all over the world here,'' she said. ``Last week we got
31 Norwegians. When people come to town, other than the blues
museum there's nothing. And we wanted to have something where they
can stand outside and take pictures and say these three people on
this mural are famous and they're from Clarksdale.''
</P>
<P>
   Overnight guests began coming this year to Hopson Plantation,
where the first mechanized cotton picker was developed and used and
where musicians like Pinetop Perkins and Wesley Jefferson, the
Mississippi Junebug, once lived. But in a twist on Southern
plantation tourism, visitors do not stay in the big house but
rather in the sharecropper shacks out back, which still retain some
possessions of the original occupants. The owners say they plan to
invite touring bands for warm-up shows in what used to be the
company store, which has been fitted with a small stage and
converted into a social club.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Clarksdale remains a city in transition. Butler said
bankers tend to scoff when he tries to offer a sharecropper's shack
as collateral on a loan. And days go by when O'Keefe doesn't sell a
single item in his store.
</P>
<P>
   ``This weekend was a hard weekend, because you struggle and say,
`Why am I trying to do this?''' O'Keefe said. ``But if I don't do
it, who will? If you turn your back on them, buildings start to
decay and the people with stories about them start to die.''

`THE NEW NEW THING:' MAKING REAL PROFITS FROM A VISION OF A
PRODUCT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Calif. , Wash.)  (Editors: Publication notes appear at end of review.) (DW) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Michael Lewis' entertaining new book tells it, the seeds of
the Internet boom were planted one day in the early 1990s when the
entrepreneur Jim Clark glimpsed a friend's huge new yacht. The ever
competitive Clark decided he wanted an even bigger, better boat _ a
boat that could be completely run by computers _ and in 1995, to
finance his 157-foot-long dream, he decided to take the company he
had just founded public. That company was named Netscape, and its
initial public offering not only made Clark a billionaire (and more
than paid for the construction of his dream yacht), but it also
helped set off a frenzied wave of Internet speculation that
effectively redrew the financial landscape.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Lewis writes, Clark's envious glimpse of his friend's
boat turned out to be ``one of those small perturbations that
radically altered the world we inhabit.''
</P>
<P>
   Although ``The New New Thing'' oversimplifies history for the
sake of making that history accessible to the lay reader, Lewis
does a sprightly job of conjuring up the heady world of Silicon
Valley and its reigning ethos of innovation. In short, he does for
the late 1990s world of techno-geeks and software cowboys what he
did in ``Liar's Poker'' for the 1980s Wall Street world of traders
and arbitrageurs.
</P>
<P>
   The focal point of ``The New New Thing'' is Clark, the founder
of Netscape and two other wildly lucrative companies, Silicon
Graphics and Healtheon. Clark is to Silicon Valley, Lewis argues,
what Silicon Valley is to America, and America is to the rest of
the world. He embodies the forces of risk-taking and disruptive
change, and the instinct for the ``new new thing'' _ the concept
that will, given a small push, ignite the marketplace and change
the world. Clark is the swaggering new American frontiersman,
boldly going where no man has gone before, then moving on to yet
another vista while others try to domesticate his accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   In relating the story of Jim Clark, Lewis uses a sort of Tom
Wolfe approach, enlivening his account of complicated financial
deals and even more complicated engineering feats with snappy cameoportraits, exclamatory descriptions and lots of subjective
judgments. Lewis makes no attempt to hide the fact that he sees
Clark as a kind of genius, a utopian ``on an endless search for
some unattainable solution,'' a conceptual artist whose ``talent
for anarchy'' happens to be uniquely suited to this particular
moment in history.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Clark, Bill Gates emerges from this book as a
passive self-promoter who wants the future ``to look exactly like
the present'' and whose company, Microsoft, doesn't want to
discover the new new thing but simply tame it. Even more
dinosaurlike, in Lewis' opinion, are those managers and financiers
who still try to operate by 1950s standards of consensus _ dull,
gray-flannel organization men with whom Clark has continually
clashed.
</P>
<P>
   By tracing the evolution of Clark's three companies _ Silicon
Graphics (which pioneered the possibilities of computer-generated
three-dimensional graphics); the Internet browser Netscape, and the
latest, Healtheon (which aims to computerize health care
management) _ Lewis gives the reader a quixotic guided tour through
Silicon Valley while showing how its success stories revolutionized
American business.
</P>
<P>
   As the successful public offerings of Netscape and Healtheon
demonstrated, Lewis observes, ``the Internet formula for success
turned traditional capitalism on its head.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditionally,'' he writes, ``a company persuaded people to
invest in it by making profits. Now it persuaded people to invest
in it first and hoped the profits would follow.''
</P>
<P>
   In this new world, ``skepticism was not a sign of
intelligence''; it ``was a sin.'' In this new world, ``the
perception of success led to success, and the perception of failure
to failure.'' In this new world, ``You had to show that you were
the company not of the present but of the future. The most
appealing companies became those in a state of pure possibility.''
In other words, Lewis concludes, ``The U.S. capital markets
acquired the personal predilections'' of that anarchic maverick,
Jim Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lewis briefly sketches Clark's background _ an
impoverished childhood in the small town of Plainview, Tex., a
depressing stint in the Navy, and eventually a doctorate in
computer science _ he, like his subject, does not dwell on the
past. He is less interested in understanding the roots of Clark's
restlessness and ambition than he is in documenting Clark's latest
enthusiasms and brainstorms. To that end much of this book is
devoted to chronicling Clark's efforts to get Healtheon off the
ground while at the same time launching Hyperion, his bigger,
better, computerized yacht.
</P>
<P>
   To underscore the disruptive effect his hero has had on
traditional business methods, Lewis also spends a lot of time
showing us the domino effect _ sometimes exhilarating, sometimes
anxiety-inducing _ Clark has had on the people who work for him:
from the brilliant young engineers whom he helped make into
millionaires; to the scrambling venture capitalists desperate to
get in on his latest project, to the befuddled members of his yacht
crew doggedly trying to reconcile new-fangled computerized wizardry
with old-fashioned seamanship.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as Healtheon is making him a ``real after-tax
billionaire,'' Clark is already moving on to the next new things: a
company called My CFO that will help rich people organize their
finances, and yes, plans for another boat: ``a sailboat half again
as big as Hyperion, or a bit longer than 250 feet.''

 &HT;    ACCOUNTS MISUSED IN IMPROVEMENTS TO AIR FORCE ACADEMY HOMES,
REPORT SAYS
 &HT;    By Scott Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Air Force's already strained operations and
maintenance accounts have been used improperly to pay for
renovations to the homes of the superintendent and commandant of
the Air Force Academy, an audit released Monday has found.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the Air Force Auditing Agency, requested by Air
Force Secretary F. Whitten Peters, also concluded that many of the
improvements couldn't be justified, including $4,200 for a
fireplace mantel that was added in 1998 ``at the occupant's
request.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the audit's findings:
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 remodeling of the kitchen at Carlton House, home of the
superintendent, cost $308,000, more than twice the budgeted
allowance because of upgrades in counter tops and appliances, many
of which were only a year old. The additional money covered $17,000
for a 90-second cycle dishwasher that auditors said didn't seem
warranted.
</P>
<P>
   The new kitchen at the Carlton House was done even though the
justifying documentation mentioned only poor lighting, ventilation
and a refrigerator that was ``not functional for a family.''
</P>
<P>
   Improvements at Otis House, the commandant's home, include
$40,000 to move a bathroom wall to widen an adjoining bedroom's
interior dimension by one foot.
</P>
<P>
   $14,000 was set aside for converting the Otis House's charcoal
grill to natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give me a break! $14,000?'' said U.S. Rep. David L. Hobson,
R-Springfield, who heads the military construction subcommittee in
the House. ``I think this stuff is outrageous. These people are
living like kings and queens and the troops are not.''
</P>
<P>
   Hobson, who is expecting results for a similar audit he
requested from the Navy, said that while he appreciates the
recommendations offered by the Air Force audit to ensure that
operations money isn't used on generals' quarters in the future, he
wants to see someone punished.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all say they won't do it again,'' he said, ``but unless
somebody is reprimanded it will happen again. Somebody had to order
this for it to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The two 1930's-era homes at the Air Force Academy are private
residences that also are used for public Academy gatherings, such
as graduation parties. For years, the Air Force has split the cost
of the residences between operations and military housing accounts.
Public sections of the houses are maintained by the operations and
maintenance budget, and private sections such as bedrooms are
financed through military housing.
</P>
<P>
   But the audit found that money crossed designations with little,
if any accountability. The oversight panel that must approve
expenditures at the Carlton House is chaired by the general who
lives in the house.
</P>
<P>
   And the audit found little logic behind the way the Air Force
designated rooms either public or private anyway. For instance,
although both the Carlton House and Otis House are used equally for
public functions _ a little more than once a month _ the Otis
kitchen is designated as private, while the Carlton kitchen is
considered public.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what happens when there's no accountability,'' Hobson
said. ``It also just shows an arrogance of position, where people
forgot the public trust.''

   EREZ CROSSING, Gaza Strip _ Khader Juneed, 23, had never set
foot outside Gaza in his life, and his family didn't want him to,
either. His parents feared he might never return, and so when he
came home proudly last week with a shiny new Israeli-issued permit
that would allow him to travel to the West Bank, they forbade him
to use it.
</P>
<P>
   Monday morning, Juneed said, he acted as if he were leaving for
work. He put his construction boots in one black plastic bag and
his painter's pants in another. And then he hitched a ride to the
border with Israel without saying goodbye, not even to his wife and
three children.
</P>
<P>
   As he waited in line to be searched by Israeli soldiers, Juneed
opened a green vinyl folder to show off the magnetic crossing card
that he, like many other young and underemployed Gazans, sees as an
exit permit from a life without a future.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my life I lived behind the high walls of Gaza, like a
prisoner behind a fence,'' he said. ``Now I am grabbing at the
opportunity to know the Palestinian world on the other side. To
Gazans, the West Bank seems like the land of plenty.''
</P>
<P>
   The first ``safe passage'' route between the Gaza Strip and the
West Bank opened Monday, re-establishing a lifeline between the
divided portions of the Palestinian world. The opening went
smoothly, with relatively quick processing at the border and barely
any protest from Israelis, except for six men with an angry banner
along the way.
</P>
<P>
   It marked another concrete step forward in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace effort that was revived by Ehud Barak,
who took office as prime minister in July. But the route came four
years after it was first promised and four weeks late under the
timetable of the latest Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   And the recent delay, caused by haggling over procedures that
revealed distrust on both sides, hinted at the difficulties that
lie ahead as Barak aims to forge a final peace agreement under a
tight deadline _ by next September.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, little fanfare marked a moment the Palestinians have
long awaited, the re-creation of a link between the two cultures
and the two economies that make up the Palestinian territories _
and the would-be Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   About 11 a.m., the first of about 20 buses simply rolled away
from Gaza through the 28-mile corridor through mostly desolate
Israeli countryside to the southern West Bank town of Tarqumiya,
near Hebron.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of the day, some 600 Gazans, mostly young men,
made the journey through checkpoints on both sides, with a total of
four document inspections, two computerized, before they were
cleared to board local buses to their final destinations.
</P>
<P>
   For some it meant a reconnection with long-lost relatives, but
for most, like Juneed, it offered vague but hopeful possibilities _
maybe of a better job, maybe of nothing more than a brief respite
from the grinding insularity of Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at us, hanging out the windows, waving,'' Hamed Malahi,
22, said as he pressed his face against the cool windowpane of the
first bus. ``We look just like the freed prisoners.'' He was
referring to the Palestinians recently released, in buses, from
Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
   Official enthusiasm was tempered Monday by an afternoon incident
in Bethlehem that vividly evoked the days of intense conflict.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli soldier shot and killed a Palestinian man, whom
Palestinians identified as Musa Abu Ihlaiel, 28, a souvenir vendor.
Israeli army officials said the soldier had opened fire after the
man had tried to stab him during a routine document check at the
roadblock near Rachel's Tomb.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians poured into the streets in response and hurled
rocks and bottles at Israeli soldiers, who responded by firing
rubber-coated bullets and releasing tear gas, witnesses said. Five
Palestinians and one Israeli soldier were lightly wounded.
</P>
<P>
   In Gaza, too, there were some tensions, although no violence, as
Palestinians who were denied access to the safe-passage route
complained about the secrecy of the Israeli application process.
</P>
<P>
   The route has been a tender subject for both sides, bringing
into relief Israel's anxieties about abetting terrorism by linking
the Palestinian territories and the Palestinians' anxieties about
the way the Israelis control their movement.
</P>
<P>
   Some 10,000 Gazans have applied for yearlong permits _ magnetic
cards that look like driver's licenses _ and so far about 2,000
have been granted, said Ziad Alabed, the Palestinian official in
charge of safe passage.
</P>
<P>
   Of the applications that have been processed, about 11 percent
have been turned down with no explanation, even though the passage
was supposed to be open even to Palestinians without security
clearance. Some who were turned down for the card will be allowed
access twice a week on army-escorted buses, Alabed said.
</P>
<P>
   The names of the rejected were posted on the wall of the Civil
Affairs Ministry in Gaza, as if on a blacklist, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Few Palestinians _ about 200 _ have applied to travel the route
in the other direction, from the relatively more affluent and
liberal West Bank to Gaza, where wages are much lower and
unemployment much higher.
</P>
<P>
   This makes it clear that at least at first, the route will serve
partly as a one-way labor migration path, testing the West Bank's
limited capacity to absorb unskilled workers.
</P>
<P>
   Juneed, a thin man with a long, sad face, said he had been
earning $1.25 an hour on construction jobs, when he could find
them, and living with his family of five in a single room in the
Balatiya refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents had to help us, which was humiliating to me as a
man,'' he said. ``I have one clear goal in the West Bank: better
job, better money.''
</P>
<P>
   A Gazan merchant, Amir Sarhi, offered him some counsel: ``Go to
Bethlehem, young man. That is where the money is, what with the big
plans for the millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   At the checkpoint in Erez, the Gazans filed through processing
lines as Israeli soldiers checked their documents on a computer.
Right before Juneed came to the window, a computer alert sounded,
and after 15 minutes soldiers led the man in front of him away.
</P>
<P>
   Inside his windbreaker Juneed was sweating profusely, and he
sighed with relief when he was ushered through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so happy,'' he said, as he boarded a bus and took a seat,
shyly smiling. ``This is like a holiday.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Descending at Tarqumiya, where the dry, intense heat of Gaza had
given way to the cool autumn winds of the rocky hills, Juneed
looked about him uncertainly. He had no idea what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   At first, he tried to hook up with a neighbor from his refugee
camp, who jumped into a taxi and abandoned him. Surely the next
bus, he said, kicking his worn loafers in the dirt road, would
bring a friend.
</P>
<P>
   He borrowed a cellular phone, called home and admitted to his
sister that he had taken off, with only $50 in his pocket and the
phone number of a distant relative scribbled on a paper scrap. He
cried.
</P>
<P>
   Sarhi, the merchant, tried to console him. ``As far as you have
Arabs around you, you have people you can trust,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When the next bus arrived, Juneed nodded, spotting someone
getting off. ``I knew it _ there is a friend,'' he said. ``He may
not know any more than me, but I will stick with him and we will be
OK.''
</P>
<P>
   He seemed unfazed when the friend barely grunted a greeting his
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inshallah, God willing,'' Juneed said, waving. ``May all your
faces guide me on my way.''

LIFTING A MUSTY CURTAIN FOR A PEEK INSIDE THE CRYPT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany)   By RALPH BLUMENTHAL

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the gravy-dark recesses of the mind (and backstage
at the New Victory Theater on 42d Street) strange phantasms scuttle
beneath the floorboards and rattle locked doors, demanding to be
let out.
</P>
<P>
   As audiences titter nervously at the Victorian grotesqueries of
``Shockheaded Peter,'' a London troupe's zany ``junk opera'' based
on the 19th-century German children's classic ``Struwwelpeter,''
another drama is unfolding behind the curtain.
</P>
<P>
   Martyn Jacques, the falsetto-voiced accordion player who
improbably set to music Dr. Heinrich Hoffmann's satirical warnings
against being a slob, playing with matches and thumb-sucking,
crouches under a trapdoor, waiting to be hauled onstage by his
(real) pigtail.
</P>
<P>
   Jo Pocock, the sinister Victorian maid (and puppeteer), also
creeps beneath the floor. Graeme Gilmour, her fellow puppeteer,
helps manipulate the stork that brings a couple the child they
yearn for _ until they see what a slovenly monster little Peter is.
</P>
<P>
   Julian Bleach, the ghoulish MC with a weakness for Shakespearean
tragedy, clutches the curtain around his neck and contorts his body
to ``levitate'' his seemingly detached head until his wig falls
off. Backstage he rushes to switch his battered top hat and
tattered tails for a molded baby boy costume (anatomically
correct).
</P>
<P>
   Tamzin Griffin, the poor mother, ducks behind the curtain to
turn into a monster herself, donning a tangled shaggy wig and
yardlong fingernails. Anthony Cairns, her suffering husband, also
gets fitted with the clawlike nails and the red nose of a helpless
inebriate driven to drink by _ what else? _ his incorrigible child.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Jacques' accompanists, the sepulchral Adrian Stout and
the impish Adrian Huge, climb catwalks to turn up unexpectedly at
the upper windows of the set.
</P>
<P>
   Bleach, who developed the show several years ago with the
directors Phelim McDermott and Julian Crouch said that anything
that goes wrong is incorporated into the plot of the show, which
closes on Sunday. As for the script _ well, said Bleach, ``there is
no script.''

PALESTINIANS FLOCK THROUGH `SAFE PASSAGE' ROAD LINKING GAZA WITH
WEST BANK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EREZ CHECKPOINT, Gaza Strip _ Mohammed Ghanem, a diminutive
Palestinian clutching a backpack, edged to the front of a long line
of men and waited to board a bus that would take him on his first
journey to the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   At 19, Ghanem, a new recruit in the Palestinian police, had
never been outside of Gaza, a tiny strip of territory wedged
between Israel, the Mediterranean Sea and the Egyptian Sinai.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he and hundreds of other Palestinians finally made
the hourlong trek on the long-awaited ``safe passage'' through
Israel. The 28-mile stretch of road for the first time links Gaza
with the West Bank, the two areas under Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be the first time in my life to go there,'' Ghanem
said, moving swiftly past Palestinian guards toward an orange taxi
that would drive him to the bus. ``I can finally see (the rest of)
my homeland.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians said they hoped the passage would help unite the
West Bank and Gaza, politically, economically and socially. Many
Palestinians consider the opening of the safe passage as an
important step toward statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those waiting at the Erez Checkpoint said they were
going to visit relatives, others to work, and still others simply
to see what life was like for their Palestinian brethren in towns
and villages that most had been barred from visiting for years due
to Israeli security restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, Israel has imposed stringent security measures that
have prevented most of the 3 million Palestinians from traveling
between the West Bank and Gaza. A limited number were issued
permits to leave their respective territories for work in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to breathe the air,'' said Said Lasda, a 23-year-old
on his way to the southern West Bank town of Hebron to visit
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The opening of the passage underscored the good will that has
characterized relations between Israelis and Palestinians since
Israel's new centrist prime minister, Ehud Barak, took office in
July.
</P>
<P>
   Around mid-morning, Israeli and Palestinian officials celebrated
the opening with a modest ceremony at the checkpoint, a massive
area of concrete, metal detectors and turnstiles manned by Israeli
soldiers at one end and Palestinian police at the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very happy that we are implementing the agreement,''
said Jamil Tarifi, the Palestinian minister for civil affairs, who
helped negotiate the safe passage accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been discussing it for five years,'' Tarifi said.
``We're very happy we can start operating it.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, the first Palestinian car drove up to be
checked by Israeli security personnel wearing white gloves that can
detect traces of explosives. After 10 minutes, the driver, a
Palestinian official, was given permission to head into Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this will be a step toward geographic unity between the
West Bank and Gaza Strip,'' said the official, Mousa Abu Saadeh.
</P>
<P>
   By 11 a.m., the first ordinary Palestinians began making the
hourlong trek through the rolling forests and farmland of central
Israel to the Tarkumia checkpoint at the southern end of the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people want to go because they (feel) they are in a big
prison (in Gaza),'' said Mahmoud Audeh, a 39-year-old government
worker on his way to shop in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to feel a little freer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the agreement, any Palestinian can use the passage
by first obtaining a metallic identity card that is valid for one
year, except those deemed security risks by Israel. But even they
can use the passage twice weekly by riding special buses escorted
by Israeli security.
</P>
<P>
   Most other Palestinians also will use buses designated for the
trip. A limited number will be allowed to use personal cars. Those
in cars will have 90 minutes to reach the other side. Anyone who
arrives late will be questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the safe passage was to consist of four specially
marked roads across Israel. After months of haggling, negotiators
reduced the number of designated roads to two. A second passageway
that will lead to the northern West Bank is supposed to open soon.
</P>
<P>
   Some Israelis said they were worried that the passage could make
it easier for terrorists to travel. But most said they hoped the
passage would run smoothly. A handful of Israelis demonstrated
against the passage just north of the checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are afraid,'' said Shimon Cohen, the mayor of Hof Ashkelon,
an Israeli city north of Gaza near the southern route. ``But we
hope the transit will be safe with no stops, and we hope it will
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourism between the areas was expected to increase, with
hundreds of West Bank Palestinians heading for Gaza's Mediterranean
coast.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the men waiting in line Monday said they had come in
search of work on the more prosperous West Bank. Most said they had
come to visit the West Bank because, after so many years, they
finally could.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to look around,'' said Rami Abu Ata, a 21-year-old
Gazan waiting in line at the Tarkoumiya checkpoint at the entrance
to the West Bank. ``I've never been here before.''

ONCE AGAIN, HELMS AND COMPANY LAND GOP IN HOT WATER OVER RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By SEAN LOUGHLIN   
 NYT Regional Newspapers   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans find themselves in a familiar place
these days on matters of race _ on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   With his threat last week to block the nomination of a black
woman and former senator to an ambassadorship, Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., has helped reignite a long-running and divisive debate
about whether his party antagonizes minority voters.
</P>
<P>
   While that suggestion infuriates many Republicans, Helms' action
follows the Senate's rejection earlier this month of a black judge
in Missouri nominated to the federal bench.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, the climate has turned ugly. Democrats have
stopped short of labeling the Republican Party as racist _ but just
barely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not calling them racist,'' said Sen. Tom Daschle of South
Dakota, the minority leader. ``But I am simply saying this: I think
it raises some very serious questions about the perception, the
attitude of some on the other side when it comes to minorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders counter that the Democrats are playing the
race card by impugning the motives of their GOP colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The charges are baseless and blasphemous, and it's a dangerous
game,'' said John Czwartacki, a spokesman for Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Helms has relied on prepared statements to call
into question former Illinois Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun's fitness to
serve as ambassador to New Zealand. Moseley-Braun, who lost
re-election last year, faced charges that she misused campaign
funds during her tenure.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Helms' earlier comment to a Capitol Hill newspaper
that raised eyebrows. Helms said Moseley-Braun should apologize for
her 1993 opposition to Senate approval of a design patent for the
United Daughters of the Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   Several black lawmakers said they were insulted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly those of us who are students are history know that
the Daughters of the Confederacy grew out of the Confederate
states, which grew out of concerns over slavery, which grew out of
race,'' said Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., chairman of the
Congressional Black Caucus. ``No matter what you may say about the
War of Northern Aggression _ and that's in quotes _ the fact
remains that slavery was a very big part of the Civil War.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the fight over Missouri Judge Ronnie White has
stirred deep passions. Nominated by President Clinton to serve on
the federal bench, White was rejected by the Senate four weeks ago
on a party line vote. Republicans characterized him as weak on
crime, and they faulted him for overturning some death penalty
cases. White, however, affirmed 70 percent of the death penalty
cases brought to him for review.
</P>
<P>
   Minority groups point to a study by the Constitution Project, a
bipartisan group affiliated with Georgetown University, showing
that white candidates for judicial posts were twice as likely to
win confirmation from the last Congress as minority nominees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a pattern: Blacks need not apply,'' Clyburn said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say that each case must be evaluated on its own
merits. They're quick to point out that Rep. J.C. Watts, a black
Republican from Oklahoma, occupies a higher leadership post than
any black Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans complain that they are subjected to a
double-standard because Democratic lawmakers can cast votes that
arguably hurt minority interests without being tagged as racists.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Harrison, co-chairwoman of the Republican National
Committee, noted Clinton's comment this month in which he compared
Irish leaders fighting over a peace plan to drunks in a barroom
brawl.
</P>
<P>
   The incident was covered, but it hardly drew the kind of
attention that the Moseley-Braun and White fights have generated.
``There seems to be selective outrage here,'' Harrison said.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison said it makes no sense for Republicans to alienate
minority voters because they make up a larger share of the
population each year. Two years ago, the RNC launched its New
Majority Council, an outreach program to blacks, Hispanics, and
women.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have a challenge. Time and again, election returns
point to a yawning chasm between black support for Democratic
candidates, which runs 90 percent or better, and support for
Republican contenders, which has rarely broken 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1998 races, black voter turnout proved pivotal in
several Southern campaigns, including governors' races in Alabama,
Georgia, and South Carolina, all of which Democrats won.
</P>
<P>
   David Bositis, a political analyst at the Joint Center for
Political and Economic Studies, predicted recent congressional
action would only further drive minorities away from Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They started out with a high level of mistrust in the black
community, and they've done so many things to reinforce that,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bositis dismissed GOP complaints of a double standard, saying
that the recent nomination fights must be viewed in the context of
the Republican Party's history. That includes opposition to civil
rights legislation, budget cuts to social programs that benefit
minority communities, and the association on the part of some GOP
lawmakers with the Council of Conservative Citizens, which civil
rights advocates describe as a white supremacist organization.
</P>
<P>
   Said Bositis of the Republican Party and black voters: ``It's
like they're strangers.''

Divide in 1805, have been all but erased from this place they have
called home for hundreds of years. The 400 or so Lemhi live on a
reservation 200 miles south of here, on desert land set aside for
two much bigger tribes.
</P>
<P>
   Orphans in an arid land, the Lemhi say they have been down so
long that they use an ironic phrase to describe their current
status. ``Basically, we are the Indians to the other Indians,''
said Rod Ariwite, a leader of the Shoshone Lemhi.
</P>
<P>
   But the tribe's luck may be about to change. Spurred on by an
extraordinary surge of interest in the journey of Lewis and Clark,
hoopla over a new dollar coin honoring Sacajawea and recent
scholarly finds that bolster Lemhi legal claims, the Indians from
the west side of the Continental Divide are stirred by their last
best hope for a homeland.
</P>
<P>
   The Lemhi have asked President Clinton to carve out a small
piece of federal land in the Salmon River country on the
Idaho-Montana border as a place where the tribe can tell its story
to the hordes of Lewis and Clark history buffs, honor their dead
and try to stitch some of the past to the present.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the only visible Indian in this valley is the Salmon
High School mascot, a chieftain who represents ``the Home of the
Savages,'' as the school sign says.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have Sacajawea heritage days, they have Sacajawea arts
and crafts, they have everything but the real Indians who are
Sacajawea's people in the valley,'' said Ariwite, an Air Force
veteran and high school principal who grew up in Salmon but now
lives in New Mexico and in Fort Hall, Idaho. ``The feeling we get
is, `We don't want you here, but we want your Sacajawea
heritage.'''
</P>
<P>
   The white leaders of this community say they revere the most
famous native of the valley but are ambiguous about any land being
set aside for the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all believe Sacajawea is not only the most famous Indian,
but the most famous woman in America,'' said Stan Davis, mayor of
this town of 3,000, set in an isolated Rocky Mountain valley of
heart-stopping beauty. ``And the way things are going now, with our
timber, mining and fishing in trouble, it's almost like we've come
full circle. We know what the Indians went through.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   While other tribes have spent decades going through long and
usually futile efforts to regain full tribal recognition, the Lemhi
are making a direct appeal to the conscience of the current
occupant of the White House _ a familiar Lemhi tack. In 1875, the
tribe was given a small reservation in this valley by executive
order of President Ulysses S. Grant, who was impressed by the
Lemhi's unique role in Western history and their record of
cooperation with the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   That reservation was overrun by Idaho settlers, who used fish
traps to block the once prodigious salmon runs. The starving Lemhi
abandoned their home in 1907, on a march to the south punctuated by
wails and tears. Virtually every attempt at redress in the 20th
century was held up by government assertions that the Lemhi lacked
a formal treaty to grant them nation status. Their affairs are
handled by the much larger Shoshone-Bannock tribes on the
reservation at Fort Hall, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Even late in this century, a small group of Lemhi, Ariwite among
them, continued to live in shacks by the river at the edge of town
here. But that tumbledown village was destroyed by the local
authorities more than 10 years ago. It is now a small park covered
with gravel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was our home,'' Ariwite said. ``But I guess everyone else
thought it was an eyesore.'' For a man who has an encyclopedic
knowledge of the many slights dealt the Lemhi, Ariwite betrays only
a trace of bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   ``My kids come up here with me to fish and camp in the summer,
and they say, `Dad, how could you ever give this land up?''' he
said. ``But we haven't given up. The Lewis and Clark bicentennial
is going to be our last fight. In 1805, the Americans asked for our
help. Now we're asking for theirs.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Sacajawea was a Shoshone girl who had been kidnapped by Hidatsa
Indians. She became one of two young wives of Toussaint
Charbonneau, a French-Canadian trader who won Sacajawea in a bet
with the Indians. When Charbonneau signed on with Lewis and Clark,
Sacajawea, though just 15 years old and six months pregnant, was
enlisted as an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, she nearly died of a fever. Lewis was counting on
Sacajawea to be a translator with Shoshone people who lived in the
mountains west of the Continental Divide, and he expressed concern
that her death could doom the expedition. He used bark and opium to
relieve her symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   In the late summer of 1805, as the Corps of Discovery climbed
slowly up the mountains of western Montana, the Americans were
running low on food, were without fresh horses and had little idea
about how to find the waters that drained to the Pacific. With
Sacajawea's help, they crossed the Continental Divide at Lemhi
Pass, then came upon a band of Shoshone.
</P>
<P>
   As Stephen Ambrose notes in his best-selling book on the Corps,
``Undaunted Courage'' (Simon and Schuster, 1996), the 60 Shoshone
warriors who encountered the Americans could have wiped them out
easily, ending the expedition. But Sacajawea recognized their
chief, Cameahwait, as her long lost brother, and another Shoshone,
Jumping Fish, as a girl she had not seen since the kidnapping. A
two-day, tearful reunion followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a piece of luck that was,'' Ambrose wrote. ``No novelist
could ever invent such a scene.'' The Americans traded guns, a
medallion from President Jefferson and other items for 29 horses.
They also got a Shoshone guide who helped them find the waters that
flowed to the Columbia River and the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   For her services on the expedition, Sacajawea was given nothing,
though her husband, Charbonneau, received $500. Her son,
Jean-Baptist, was later raised in part by William Clark.
</P>
<P>
   The Lemhi Shoshone lived relatively undisturbed until Mormon
missionaries, gold prospectors and cattlemen started to stake out
their land in the second half of the 19th century. An 1868 treaty
that would have given them land and legal standing was never
ratified by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, some of the Lemhi agreed to give up their homeland,
in return for payments, and to join the reservation at Fort Hall.
But in order for that agreement to be valid, it needed the
signatures of two-thirds of the Lemhi men.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Orlan J. Svingen, a professor of American history at
Washington State University in Pullman, who has been helping the
Lemhi, said his research at the National Archives had failed to
turn up the document that supposedly has the signatures of a
majority of Lemhi men.
</P>
<P>
   Also, as other historians have noted, Svingen said, the Lemhi
were told they would lose their food rations if they did not agree
to leave the valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the fact that the Lemhi did not want to leave their
home, and that the document which is supposed to have their
signatures agreeing to the move could not be found _ that makes me
very suspicious they willingly gave up their home,'' Svingen said.
</P>
<P>
   The odds of the Lemhi being restored as a tribe in the valley
where they used to live are certainly long. Even other Indians are
not helping them. The Shoshone-Bannock say the Lemhi belong with
them at Fort Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their treaty was never ratified, so basically they belong down
here,'' said Duane Thompson, chairman of the Shoshone-Bannock
Council, which governs the reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Ariwite said the Lemhi's best hope is to get a small bit of land
from the federal government, which would be used as a Sacajawea
interpretive center, and a home for some tribal members who have
never felt welcome at Fort Hall.
</P>
<P>
   But Interior Department officials expressed doubt about the
Lemhi request. ``It is very hard for us to do something like that
for one group of Indians without doing it for another,'' said
Stephanie Hanna, a spokeswoman for the Interior Department. ``If
conscience was the only factor, a whole lot of Indian land might be
given back based on historic grievances.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress has been asked by Idaho elected officials to consider
plans for a Sacajawea center here at Salmon, but not one that would
be run by the Lemhi.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're asking for is not very big,'' Ariwite said. ``Let
us build a center here _ in this valley where we have always lived
_ for our first lady. The Lewis and Clark bicentennial is our last
fight. Let us come home.''

   Shroud of Turin
</P>
<P>
   Q. I understand that the Shroud of Turin will be on public
display next year. A friend saw the shroud when it was last
displayed in 1998 and said a dated and timed ticket had to be
reserved. Can you provide details on the coming exhibition? _ Doug
Bowman, New York, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. As part of the Holy Year in 2000, the Shroud of Turin, which
many faithful believe is the burial cloth of Jesus and thus bears
his image, will be on display from Aug. 26 to Oct. 22 in the
Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Turin. The shroud, a cloth 14{
feet long by 3 and 6 inches wide, bears the image of a scourged,
crucified man. This will be only the fifth public ex(ibition of the
shroud since 1898.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket reservations can be made in the United States through a
private company, Select Italy. The telephone number is (847)
853-1661. Ticket reservations will also be possible within the next
two months at www.selectitaly.com. Details had not been confirmed
as of late this month, but when Select Italy handled the
reservations during the shroud's 1998 exhibition tickets cost $15
to $19. As you have heard, tickets must be reserved for a specific
date and time of entry.
</P>
<P>
   There are also two companies offering tours to Italy that will
include viewing of the shroud. Select International Tours and
Cruises, 116 Highway 22 East, North Plainfield, N.J. 07060, (800)
842-4842, is conducting a tour Aug. 17 to 30. Besides a stop in
Turin, the itinerary includes a visit to Germany for the Passion
Play in Oberammergau and Expo 2000 in Hanover, along with a Rhine
cruise. The price is $3,799 a person, double occupancy, plus $99 in
airport taxes. The Web site is www.select-intl.com. Unitours Inc.,
411 West Putnam Ave., Greenwich, Conn. 06830, (800) 777-7432,
offers a tour to Italy Sept. 2 to 12 with stops in Turin, Milan,
Assisi and Rome, among other cities. The price is $2,699 a person,
double occupancy, with air fare. The Web site: www.Unitours.com.

   Cottages in Scotland
</P>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I are planning an extended trip to Scotland and
are interested in renting a country cottage there. Do you have any
recommendations? _ John R. Campbell, Lady Lake, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   A. The British Tourist Authority, 551 Fifth Ave., Suite 701, New
York, N.Y. 10176, (800) 462-2748, publishes a free guide,
Self-Catering Holiday Homes, which lists individual cottage rentals
throughout Scotland (as well as England, Wales and Northern
Ireland).
</P>
<P>
   It also includes numerous rental agencies in the United States
and these three in Scotland:
</P>
<P>
   Ecosse Unique Ltd., Thorncroft, Lilliesleaf, Melrose,
Roxburghshire, TD6 9JD; telephone (44-1835) 870779, fax (44-1835)
870417.

in high season, usually July and August and the Christmas holiday
season. Rates in the low season, generally November through March,
start at about $150 a week. During all other months expect to pay
from about $235 a week and up. Deposits range from a minimum of $80

are included. Rates are calculated at $1.67 to the pound.
</P>
<P>
   There are many individual listings, too, with photographs,
descriptions and details of amenities for each. A small,
well-equipped cottage on the grounds of Kilchrist Castle, (44-1586)
553210, fax (44-1586) 551852, near the Mull of Kintyre, for
example, costs $260 to $660 a week, depending on accommodations and
season.

<P>
   Tours to Iran
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have read that tours to Iran are available. I would like to
know the names and addresses of companies offering such tours. _
Marie Anderson, Pensacola, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   A. Although it is possible for Americans to visit Iran either
independently (you must be invited by the Iranian government), or
as part of an organized tour, the Department of State issued a
warning to American citizens on Sept. 14 to defer travel to Iran.
Although President Khatami of Iran has called for an increase in
meetings between private citizens of both countries, the State
Department warning says, there is some evidence that hostility to
the United States remains in some segments of the Iranian
population and some sections of the government.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1999, violent anti-government demonstrations took place
in Tehran and other cities, and there were accusations that the
United States was behind these, the warning says. Before and since
those demonstrations, some groups of American travelers have
encountered harassment by vigilante groups.
</P>
<P>
   If you still wish to go to Iran, keep in mind that an organized
tour overcomes one difficulty: American credit cards and traveler's
checks are generally not accepted in Iran. With a prepaid tour, you
will not have to carry as much cash. Another advantage of using a
tour operator is that it streamlines the process of getting an
Iranian visa.
</P>
<P>
   Among the companies that conduct tours to Iran are these:
</P>
<P>
   Absolute Asia, 180 Varick St., New York, N.Y. 10014, (800)
736-8187; 14- to 19-day trips that include Uzbekistan and
Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
   Bestway Tours and Safaris, Suite 102, 3540 West 41st Ave.,
Vancouver, British Columbia V6N 3E6, (800) 663-0844; among its
offerings is a nine-day tour to Iran, which can be extended with a
visit to Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
   Cyrus Travel, 8245 Boone Blvd., Suite 130, Vienna, Va. 22182,
(800) 558-8770; 12- to 21-day tours.
</P>
<P>
   Distant Horizons, 350 Elm Ave., Long Beach, Calif. 90802, (800)
333-1240; 18-day trips with stops in Yemen and Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
   Geographic Expeditions, 2627 Lombard St., San Francisco, Calif.
94123, (800) 777-8183; has trips of 18 to 24 days, with rigorous
hiking.

   In Boston, Radical Art Of Pharaohs of the Sun
</P>
<P>
   Boston lies on the Charles River, but it may seem like the Nile
to those who visit the show ``Pharaohs of the Sun: Akhenaten,
Nefertiti, Tutankhamen'' at the Museum of Fine Arts
</P>
<P>
   This exhibition, from Nov. 14 to Feb. 6, focuses on the brief
Amarna Age (1353 to 1336 B.C.), when the Pharaoh Akhenaten (also
spelled Ikhnaton) radically changed religion and art. He moved the
throne to the new city of Amarna, introduced monotheism with the
worship of Aten, the sun god, and turned away from the idealized
imagery of the previous 1,500 years for a more realistic art.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition opens with a monumental traditional piece, a
sculpture of King Thutmose III, Akhenaten's
great-great-great-grandfather, and images of Akhenaten's father,
Ahmenotop III.
</P>
<P>
   But then images of Akhenaten show a new artistic style,
depicting him with elongated head and facial features, skinny
torso, broad hips and overhanging belly. Two illustrations of this
style are colossal statues of Amenhotep that have never before left
Egypt, one of them seven feet high and weighing 3,000 pounds. These
recently restored objects are being lent by the Egyptian Museum in
Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   The pharaoh's wife, the mysteriously powerful Nefertiti, was the
only queen depicted in the archetypical images of kingship, as in a
work where she can be seen smiting enemies from the royal barge.
The show also includes a life-size quartzite head of the youthful
Nefertiti from the Egyptian Museum in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   The show goes on to look at Tutankhamen, who may have been
Akhenaten's son and who became ruler at age 10, then soon abandoned
Amarna for Thebes and reinstated the worship of Amen.
</P>
<P>
   Admission to ``Pharaohs of the Sun'' is by timed ticket, costing
$6 for ages 5 to 17 to $17.50 for adults on weekends. These are
available from (617) 542-4632, with service and handling charges.
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Fine Arts is at 465 Huntington Avenue and is open
daily. Information: (617) 267-9300; www.mfa.org. &QL;

   Click for Hotel Rooms In Midtown Manhattan
</P>
<P>
   Reservations at 30 midtown Manhattan hotels can be made through
a new Web site, www.hotres.com _ at discounted rates. Hotres.com
has a block of reserved rooms at reduced rates at the hotels, which
are between 32rd and 59th Streets.
</P>
<P>
   The hotels run from deluxe like the Waldorf-Astoria and the
Grand Hyatt, at $250 and up a night) to midrange (like the
Algonquin or the Roosevelt, at about $200 to $250) to moderate
(like the Milford Plaza or Travel Inn, at about $150 to $200). The
discount is between 10 percent and 50 percent off the published
rate, depending on the time of year.
</P>
<P>
   The main benefit of the service is that the rooms have been
already been reserved by hotres.com, and so lodging may be
available even if a hotel says it is sold out. Bookings can be made
as late as the day before arrival.
</P>
<P>
   After travel dates are entered and a hotel selected, the Web
site provides rates and availability of rooms. Daily prices and
availability are also shown for the week before and the week after.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, information for four other hotels in the same price
range is shown. The site also lists the facilities and services at
each hotel.
</P>
<P>

   An Airport Enters the Realm of Museums
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco International Airport recently became the first
airport to be accredited by the American Association of Museums, a
private organization that sets professional museum standards in the
United States. The association has accredited more than 750
institutions, from the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York to
zoos to local historical sites. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco has mounted airport exhibitions since 1980, and
the airport's three terminals now have 17 gallery areas. A
full-time staff of 27 curators, designers and others produces more
than 40 shows a year, featuring photography, folk art and
historical, ethnographic and archeological materials. (There are no
fine art exhibitions.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the current offerings at San Francisco International is an
exhibition on the history of tea, which includes an assortment of
pots, strainers, bowls and canisters, on display through May.
</P>
<P>
   Another exhibition, through January, examines teeth-blackening
and other Japanese cosmetic practices during the late Edo and Meiji
periods (1784-1912).

   A New Way to See Bermuda's Capital
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to Bermuda have a new method of transportation _
trolleylike buses that tour the capital, Hamilton, and the dockyard
area.
</P>
<P>
   These 60-seat vehicles have two linked cars and locally are
called trains. Passengers can get on and off an unlimited number of
times throughout the day for a single fare.
</P>
<P>
   The Hamilton Train makes six stops: Albuoy's Point, City Hall,
the Cathedral of the Most Holy Trinity, the botanical gardens, the
Bermuda Underwater Exploration Institute and the flagpole below
Burnaby Hill. The Dockyard Train calls at the crafts market, the
shopping center and a gallery where visitors can watch artisans
work.
</P>
<P>
   A regular day pass costs $10. (A Bermudian dollar is equivalent
to an American dollar.) A $25 ticket includes admission to the
underwater institute (usually $9.75), the National Gallery ($3) and
the tower of the cathedral ($3).
</P>
<P>
   Tickets can be bought at hotels, Oleander cycle shops and the
Hamilton train station.
</P>
<P>
   More information about Bermuda is available at (800) 237-6832 or
(441) 292-0023 and at www.bermudatourism.com.

   New Role for Loop Landmark
</P>
<P>
   Daniel H. Burnham, the architect and city planner who designed
many American landmarks, including the Flatiron Building in
Manhattan, conceived the Reliance Building in Chicago as a center
for business and a harbinger of skyscrapers and walls of glass.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen stories high and draped in 12,000 panes of blond terra
cotta, the structure was finished in 1895, incorporating
avant-garde elements, from its airy steel skeleton to a facade of
large bay windows. The interior was furnished with mahogany, white
marble wainscoting, mosaic floors and a quatrefoil motif.
</P>
<P>
   The Reliance, at State and Washington Streets, just east of
Daley Plaza in The Loop, had fallen into such shabby disuse after
nearly a century as an office building that Chicago acquired it
through eminent domain. There was talk of razing it after 1990s
developers found it ill-suited for modern commerce.
</P>
<P>
   But the spirit of reinvention prevailed last year, and the
classic building began a new life. After a restoration by Chicago
engineers and artisans, who sought to replicate as many of the
original details as possible, the old Reliance is a new boutique
hotel, named after its creator.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel Burnham, operated by the Kimpton Hotel and Restaurant
Group of San Francisco, opened Oct. 1. Although rooms are just
average in size, there are mahogany writing desks, chaise longues
by the windows and such conveniences as dataports and fax machines.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel contains a casual restaurant, the Atwood Cafe (as in
Charles B. Atwood, Burnham's partner), and room service is
available. It has 103 rooms, with rates starting at $145 a night,
and 19 suites, from $195. Reservations: (877) 294-9712.

DEMOCRATIC SENATOR TRIES A REPUBLICAN PLOY TO BLOCK A NOMINEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer is trying to beat her
Republican colleagues at one of their favorite parliamentary games.
</P>
<P>
   This game takes only one senator to play, and often the opening
move is made in secret. It's called placing a so-called ``hold'' on
a bill or a nomination, effectively blocking either one unless the
hold is removed.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have blasted Republicans over the last few years for
placing holds on dozens of President Clinton's nominees. Among them
were Bill Lann Lee, the acting head of the Justice Department's
civil rights division, who never made it as official head of the
division. Another was James Hormel, whose nomination to be U.S.
ambassador to Luxembourg was blocked for 18 months because he is
gay. But Hormel got the post in June because Clinton snuck him in
while Congress was not in session.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes Barbara Boxer, a liberal Californian, who last week
used the ploy to try to extract a concession from a powerful
Mississippi conservative. But she didn't do it secretly; she issued
a statement about it.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer put a hold on Glenn McCullough, the mayor of Tupelo,
Miss., who was nominated by Clinton for the board of the Tennessee
Valley Authority as a favor to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   McCullough's career path is not a concern to Boxer, but his
sponsor, Lott, is.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer said in her statement she has ``no problem with Sen.
Lott's nominee ... as long as Sen. Lott and the Republican majority
also consider those who have been waiting for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer is focusing on two California nominees to the U.S. Ninth
Circuit Court of Appeals _ lawyer Marsha Berzon, who has been
waiting more thyears, and U.S. District Judge Richard Paez,
whose nomination has been stalled for almost four years.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer may have struck a responsive chord. Lott's spokesman, John
Czwartacki, said Monday that the majority leader has pledged to
``work with all sides to get these nominations to the floor.''

Y2K TRAVEL: STILL QUESTIONS IN THE AIR  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 31) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two months before 1999 ends and computers get their
real test of whether they know that time marches onward (and not
back 100 years), the Y2K preparedness of air transportation systems
worldwide falls into two categories: ``ready'' and ``unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   A Department of Transportation Web site on Y2K,
www.y2ktransport.dot.gov, captures the state of ambiguity:
</P>
<P>
   ``The current expectation is that conditions related to Y2K
transition might give rise to isolated service disruptions that
could subject passengers to inconvenient delays or diversions while
traveling either domestically or abroad,'' the agency said.
``Nevertheless, the whole Y2K phenomenon is characterized by
uncertainty as to its effect.''
</P>
<P>
   The effect will not include computer failures that make planes
fall out of the sky, experts say, but there may be air traffic
control breakdowns that will gum up air travel by making
controllers keep planes on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K Web site gives a fairly thorough rundown, airport by
airport and airline by airline, of what has been reported. For
Colombia, for example, the file on the airport at Cali notes that a
circular published in July ``indicates Y2K preparations progress
but no estimated completion date is provided.'' For Avianca, the
Colombian airline, ``no substantive reports concerning status are
available to the Department of Transportation.''
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the scale, in Britain, the Web site says,
``a comprehensive and thorough program to attempt to identify and
correct potential aviation-related Y2K-related programs will have
been implemented by Dec. 31.'' The department anticipates little
chance of numerous, lengthy or severe disruptions in civil aviation
there, and the Web site also said that British Airways told the
International Civil Aviation Organization that its Y2K preparations
are complete, but that all is not perfect; the airline is waiting
to receive contingency plans from some airports it uses.
</P>
<P>
   Destinations with caveats like that may be better bets than
places with none. Eight places _ Bharain, Denmark, Hong Kong,
Israel, Nicaragua, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden and Taiwan _
report being entirely ready, but nobody from outside is auditing to
be sure.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-eight other countries are described as having a program
in place and reporting that it will be completed by Dec. 31. Those
countries include the most common destinations in the developed
world. And 25 more have ``comprehensive and thorough programs
underway,'' but no deadline for completion.
</P>
<P>
   Three more have provided ``insufficient information'' to allow a
judgment: the Marshall Islands, the Turks and Caicos and Uruguay.
The department advises prudent travelers flying to any of these
countries immediately before and after New Year's Day to plan their
itinerary carefully, get as much information as possible before
departure, take practical precautions for their own comfort and
personal needs, and be prepared to cope with disruptions and
delays.
</P>
<P>
   And 29 nations provided no information at all, including Iraq,
Cambodia, Vietnam and Papua New Guinea.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Transportation Department site says in a disclaimer,
``a lack of Y2K readiness does not necessarily translate into
safety problems.'' In fact, some countries do not have air traffic
control radar, which is what the computers mostly control. Others
have computers with histories of frequent failure, so a failure on
Jan. 1 would not be much different than others that they know how
to cope with.
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Department document covers only 90 foreign
destinations, those with direct air service to the United States.
Officials hope to post data on 45 or so others soon; that would
cover about 99 percent of air traffic, says David Smallen, who
manages the Web page.
</P>
<P>
   The United States says that its system is almost entirely ready.
On the first page of the FAA Web site on Y2K (www.faay2k.com, which
has a link on the DOT site), Jane Garvey, the agency's
administrator, says ``Aviation safety will not be compromised on
January 1, 2000, or any other day.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Garvey is preparing to put her carry-on where her mouth is;
she said she is scheduled to fly on New Year's Eve. She will take
an American Airlines flight from Washington to Dallas that will be
airborne at midnight Coordinated Universal Time, (formerly
Greenwich Mean Time) _ which is what the air traffic system runs on
_ or 7 p.m Eastern time. Then she will change to a flight to San
Francisco that will be in the air at midnight Pacific time.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, David Honkanen, project manager for Y2K for the
company that runs the Canadian air traffic control system, Nav
Canada, plans to fly from his office in Ottawa to Vancouver that
night, ``riding the wave,'' as he put it, of Y2K rollovers, by
going from the Eastern time zone to the Pacific; a colleague will
fly from Toronto to London to show the system works in both
directions.
</P>
<P>
   Honkanen said that if he were flying to other countries, he
would rely on the judgments made by the airlines, especially those
with code-sharing alliances. For instance, he said, Air Canada is a
member of the Star Alliance, and its members _ including Lufthansa,
Varig Brazilian Airlines, Thai Airways, United Airlines and others
_ would know from one another whether a country's air traffic
preparations were so poor that it was a mistake to fly there.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines are indeed watching carefully and a few are taking
precautions. For example, some Asian carriers are afraid that power
will fail in India and knock out air traffic control there, so they
are drawing up plans to divert flights to Europe.

NEWS ANALYSIS: BUCHANAN COULD BE THE WILD CARD OF THE 2000
CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Minn., Ky., Okla.) (With BUCHANAN-REFORM) 
(DW) 
 By RICHARD BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At first glance, Pat Buchanan appears sapped of the
political potency that made him an important player in the 1996
presidential campaign: His pitch then to the economically
distressed now carries little appeal given the resurgency in New
Hampshire. His comments about Hitler in his new book have drawn
hostile denunciations from prominent Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Buchanan's failure to make a dent in polls of
Republican voters practically drove him to the Reform Party. Even
his bid for the party's nomination is hardly assured. Others with
marquee names or fatter bank accounts _ from Donald Trump to Jesse
Ventura to Ross Perot _ may have an easier time navigating the
Byzantine, and costly, Reform Party rules for getting on state
ballots.
</P>
<P>
   And yet for all his apparent weaknesses, Buchanan may be the
wild card of the 2000 campaign. He could cause incalculable
mischief for both Republicans and Democrats because Buchanan has
the unusual potential to strike a chord both among grass-roots
conservatives and with union members who usually vote Democratic.
He is, perhaps, the only candidate since George Wallace who has
some appeal to those wings of both parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an expert on getting attention for himself,'' said Scott
Reed, who ran Bob Dole's presidential campaign in 1996, ``and he'll
look to keep both parties in line on issues that he cares about
like trade and his nationalist agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if he does not ultimately win the Reform Party nomination
next summer, Buchanan _ with his knack for forcefully and
unabashedly speaking his mind _ could help drive the discourse in
the coming months. As a longtime television commentator, he is a
master at commanding television coverage _ and uttering the
perfectly provocative sound bite.
</P>
<P>
   The nightmare scenario for politicians on both sides would be
for Buchanan to pop up on nationally televised debates next fall
and bash both parties, much as he did in his announcement Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan poses the biggest threat to Republicans because he
still has a following in that party. On issues like human rights in
China and national sovereignty, Buchanan could force Republican
candidates to move to the right, something that could hurt them in
a general election.
</P>
<P>
   But the most daunting challenge for Republicans may be how to
react to Buchanan. His hard-edged oratory at the Republican
convention in 1992 frightened President Bush's campaign. Some of
the president's aides said he was more damaged by his handling of
Buchanan _ giving him a prime speaking slot at the convention _
than by Buchanan's challenge itself.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican
front-runner, said they are concerned that Buchanan, never warm to
the Bush family, will use his new platform to upbraid the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan could also torment Democrats, particularly because of
his appeal to labor. He could prod the Democratic contenders into
stands that could hurt them in a general election, like making
tougher environmental and worker safety regulations a priority to
negotiating future trade treaties.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another, more fundamental, reason for the
Republicans to have more to fear. Except for in 1976, when Jimmy
Carter drew 50 percent of the vote, no Democratic presidential
candidate has ever drawn more than 50 percent since 1964. So the
more divided the vote, the better for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's appeal to conservatives in a general election could
also spell trouble for Republicans because it could enable
Democrats to gain footholds in Southern and Mountain states where
they might not have been competitive.
</P>
<P>
   But for now at least, Buchanan has to get past Trump and others
as he seeks the Reform Party nomination. That is why in his
announcement Monday Buchanan steered clear of topics like abortion
and cultural values and concentrated on campaign finance reform,
trade and other issues championed by the party's founder, Perot.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Buchanan may have trouble convincing Reform Party members
that he deserves their nomination. For all his emphasis on the
party's issues, Buchanan hardly fit the mold of Perot _ or Ventura
_ when he mentioned in his remarks that he had been a
``Goldwaterite'' and spoke with pride about his service to
President Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Buchanan candidacy has the highest likelihood of
transforming the Reform Party from a party that connected politics
to ordinary people to one that is ideological _ and potentially
marginalized,'' said Steven J. Rosenstone, dean of the College of
Liberal Arts at the University of Minnesota and an expert on third
parties. ``With Buchanan you get an attitude and ideology, and
that's a risk for the Reform Party.''
</P>
<P>
   But, increasingly, Republicans appear uneasy with Buchanan as
well. His support among Republicans has stood at about 4 percent in
recent polls by ABC News.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat Buchanan didn't quit the Republican Party as much as the
Republican Party quite Pat Buchanan,'' said Gary Langer, ABC's
polling director.
</P>
<P>
   His strains with Republicans will probably make it far less
likely that Republican candidates would cave to Buchanan, as they
did in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's assume George W. Bush is the nominee,'' said Mickey
Edwards, a former Republican House member from Oklahoma who now
teaches at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. ``I don't see
him being pushed.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, advisers to Bush insisted that they would never consent
to include Buchanan in a candidates' debate.
</P>
<P>
   If Buchanan wins the Reform Party nomination, he will get $12.6
million in federal money because Perot drew more than 5 percent of
the vote as the party's candidate in 1996. But while that would
seem like a fortune to Buchanan's bare-bones operation, it would
not go far in a general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Pat a lot,'' said Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who has
made a cause of opposing new campaign spending restrictions. ``But
the notion that $13 million is a pot of gold is laughable on its
face. That's about half a Senate race in New York. We're talking
about running for president of the United States!''

poop.'' Portman said her mom has always been a big help to her.

BUCHANAN LEAVES GOP TO SEEK REFORM PARTY NOMINATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FALLS CHURCH, Va. _ The 2000 race for the White House turned
livelier and more complicated Monday as conservative commentator
Pat Buchanan announced he was bolting from the Republican Party to
seek the Reform Party nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's decision could spell trouble for Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, giving conservatives another option in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said he was abandoning a party in which he had been
active since Barry Goldwater ran for president because it no longer
was distinguishable from the Democratic Party on issues such as
trade and foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, candor compels us to admit that our vaunted two-party
system is a snare and a delusion, a fraud upon the nation,'' he
told a crowd of enthusiastic supporters at a suburban Virginia
hotel. ``Our two parties have become nothing but two wings of the
same bird of prey.''
</P>
<P>
   The former CNN talk-show host and speechwriter for Richard Nixon
portrayed himself as the political outsider leading the people
against the establishment that has ``rigged the game to protect the
party favorites.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So let me say to the money boys and the Beltway elites who
think that at long last they have pulled up their drawbridge and
locked us out forever: You don't know this peasant army. We haven't
begun to fight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan still faces an uphill battle just to get his name on
the 29 state ballots, where the Reform Party will not automatically
be listed in the 2000 election. The task, which must be completed
well before the party's convention in August, is expected to be
expensive and time consuming.
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party is still divided over whether Buchanan should
be its standard bearer. Social issues comprise a significant chunk
of Buchanan's platform, but are absent from the party's agenda,
which has largely focused on political reform, economic issues and
opposition to trade.
</P>
<P>
   And though Buchanan is a household name, thanks to two feisty
yet unsuccessful bids for president in 1992 and 1996, his drawing
power at the ballot box is questionable. He has failed to gain much
traction in this year's GOP race, and many voters say they don't
like him.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas billionaire Ross Perot, the party's founder and former
presidential candidate, has been silent on a Buchanan bid.
</P>
<P>
   But the party's most visible spokesman, Minnesota Gov. Jesse
Ventura, has actively opposed a Buchanan bid and has recruited New
York developer Donald Trump to oppose him.
</P>
<P>
   Trump, who announced this weekend he was defecting from the GOP
to compete with Buchanan for the Reform Party nomination, has
suggested that Buchanan harbors anti-Semitic views because Buchanan
suggests in his latest book that Hitler did not pose enough of a
threat after 1940 to warrant U.S. involvement in Europe in World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   If Buchanan is the Reform Party nominee, he could make life more
difficult for the major-party candidates, particularly Bush, who
not only had urged the commentator not to leave the party but also
refused to join in the criticism of Buchanan's view of World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Bush seemed content to let Buchanan go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat sees an America that should have stayed home while Hitler
overran Europe and perpetrated the Holocaust,'' Bush said in a
written statement from Austin, Texas. ``Republicans are proud of
America's role in defeating Nazi Germany and know that freedom
still depends on an America that is strong and engaged. ''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who was the first of the presidential
candidates to urge Buchanan to leave the party, chided Bush for
initially courting Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many of my party's leaders made the mistake of trying to
appease Buchanan. His actions today prove that their efforts were
wrong,'' said McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Most polls have shown that a Buchanan candidacy saps more votes
from Bush than from Democratic contenders Al Gore or Bill Bradley
in the general election. Buchanan attracts disgruntled
conservatives who feel Bush is not communicating their views, polls
have shown.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan has a history of making trouble for the Bush family. In
1992, Buchanan damaged President Bush when he ran an aggressive
campaign against him in the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   As a Reform Party candidate Buchanan would become eligible for
more than $12 million in federal matching funds, which would give
him the resources to attack Democrats and Republicans in television
ads.
</P>
<P>
   In his address, which was interrupted by microphone
difficulties, Buchanan attempted to marry his own culturally
conservative philosophies with the Reform Party platform, which
largely focus on economic matters.
</P>
<P>
   In a nod to traditional Reform Party goals, he spoke about the
need to ``cut out the cancerous trade deficits,'' and the evils of
the trade pacts such as the North American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Blending populist and isolationist strains, he said that ``we
must phase out foreign aid and start out for the forgotten
Americans right here in the USA.''
</P>
<P>
   He called for a new Supreme Court to ``undo the damage done this
nation by judicial aggressions, beginning with that abomination
they call Roe vs. Wade.''
</P>
<P>
   He also renewed his controversial call for ``a time-out on legal
immigration'' and added that ``all of us must learn our English
language.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's address was peppered with the kind of fiery rhetoric
and muscular prose that has long delighted his supporters and
frightened his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   He attacked candidates of both parties as ``hollow men, the
malleable men, willing to read from TelePrompTers speeches scripted
by consultants and pollsters for whom the latest print-out from the
focus group is sacred text.''
</P>
<P>
   And he warned supporters that ``this year is our last chance to
save our republic before she disappears into the godless New World
Order that our elites are constructing in a betrayal of everything
for which our founding fathers lived, fought and died.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's campaign officials said they would now begin the
arduous task of gathering petitions in the 29 states where the
Reform Party is not currently on the ballot. It is on the ballot in
21 states.
</P>
<P>
   By early summer, Reform Party members will begin voting for
their candidate. The party will choose its nominee at its August
convention in Long Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, the Buchanan organizers will have to choose whether
they want to be listed as an independent candidate, which requires
56,116 signatures or Reform Party candidate, which requires 37,380
names.
</P>
<P>
   If he is listed as an independent party candidate _ as Perot was
in 1992 and 1996 _ Buchanan would remain on the ballot even if he
did not get the Reform Party nod.

NEWS ANALYSIS: ARGENTINA'S VOTERS REJECT CORRUPTION, NOT POLICIES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES _ As Argentines woke up Monday after a night of
dancing in the streets and car-honking celebrations, they were
greeted by triumphant posters that showed President-elect Fernando
de la Rua beside an Argentine flag and the slogan, ``We all won.''
</P>
<P>
   But what exactly did 24 million voters win from a campaign that
was unusually short on issues? What kind of mandate does de la Rua,
the mayor of Buenos Aires, have after winning 48.5 percent of the
vote, a wide plurality but not an outright majority? Finally, is
the Argentina that is about to emerge after 10 years of President
Carlos Saul Menem and his sweeping retooling of the economy likely
to look very different?
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls indicated that voters wanted to send a message
rejecting Menem's flamboyant high living and perceptions that he
tolerated corrupt officials in his government. That helps explain
why de la Rua's principal opponent, Gov. Eduardo Duhalde of Buenos
Aires Province, managed 37.9 percent of the vote, the worst
electoral result for any presidential candidate of the populist
party that was founded by Gen. Juan D. Peron in the 1940s and led
by Menem over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   But there was little sign that voters were seeking a radical
change in course, nor even a partial reversal of Menem's policies
of deregulation and privatization of state agencies. Sacrosanct in
all the major presidential campaigns was universal approval of
Menem's policy of pegging the value of the peso one-to-one to the
dollar _ the cornerstone of his success in overcoming Argentina's
hyperinflation to bring the current rate below 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Argentina is aspiring for is better ethics, sincerity and
the rule of law,'' said Martin Redrado, head of an economics
research group and a former aide to Menem. ``On economic policy,
the message is continuity.''
</P>
<P>
   Mixing the messages of a strong de la Rua victory over the
governing party was a surprise comeback victory by Menem's vice
president, Carlos Ruckauf, in the governor's race in Buenos Aires
Province, making him the second most powerful elected official in
the country. Ruckauf defeated a leader of the liberal wing of de la
Rua's center-left coalition in what appeared to be a rejection of
anyone who even suggested a fundamental break with the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   There was also the strong showing by Menem's former economy
minister, Domingo Cavallo, who came in third in the presidential
race. By winning 10 percent of the national vote with a tiny
organization and no money for television advertising, Cavallo's
small conservative party won enough seats in the lower house to
become a crucial swing vote on economic issues.
</P>
<P>
   Cavallo, who is a senator, has pledged to use his bargaining
power to continue the Menem revolution of cutting regulations, as
well as business taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic message is change the people, not the policies,''
Felipe Noguera, a pollster who was a consultant for Cavallo's
campaign, said. ``These elections were about getting rid of Menem,
as opposed to thinking about what comes next.''
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls showed that 60 percent of those who voted for de la
Rua, a sober 62-year-old who gardens, plays golf and wears ascots,
said they did so because of his honesty. Only a third said they
voted for him because of his proposals.
</P>
<P>
   De la Rua said he would lower the 14.5 percent unemployment rate
and bridge a growing gap between rich and poor. But he never
explained exactly how he would accomplish those goals.
</P>
<P>
   Some of de la Rua's aides are said to favor some mild forms of
subsidies and protectionism, but the candidate did not go into
specifics. Nor did he explain how he would manage his main hurdle
in the coming months _ financing $16 billion in foreign debt _
beyond saying he would shave government waste and crack down on tax
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   De la Rua's greatest applause lines of his campaign came when he
and his running mate suggested that corrupt officials in the
current government would face justice. But few analysts expect more
than a few token prosecutions, because the courts remain in the
hands of Menem's Justicialist party, popularly known as the
Peronistas.
</P>
<P>
   In his victory speech on Sunday night, de la Rua emphasized his
openness to all political forces and his willingness to reach
consensus. With the Supreme Court and the Senate controlled by the
opposition and his coalition lacking a majority in the lower house,
negotiation will be necessary to achieve anything.
</P>
<P>
   Much as in recent years in the United States, Argentines appear
to be in the mood for divided rule. Over the last several months,
Argentines elected 14 Justicialists in 23 gubernatorial races, even
as de la Rua led in the polls to succeed Menem.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the majority of governors in the hands of the
Peronistas,'' said Joaquin Morales Sola, a columnist at a daily
here, La Nacion, ``the result is a tie in terms of institutional
power. What we will see is a cohabitation of power, a permanent
politics of consensus.''

TEACHER AGREES TO RESIGN OVER BOOK CHOICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROGER CROTEAU  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOERNE, Texas _ The high school English teacher who was
reprimanded for assigning an award-winning novel that some parents
said was too graphic has agreed to resign in a deal negotiated with
the school board.
</P>
<P>
   Frances Riley reached an agreement last week with the Boerne
school board, placing her on paid administrative leave until the
end of the year, when her resignation will become effective. The
district also agreed to remove the reprimand from her personnel
file.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased with the way it has worked out, and the union did
a great job,'' Riley said, referring to the Texas Federation of
Teachers, which represented her in negotiations with the board.
``And with that, I'd like to lay it to rest.''
</P>
<P>
   In September, Riley assigned the award-winning 1995 David
Guterson book ``Snow Falling on Cedars'' to 80 senior English
students at Boerne High School. The story about a Japanese-American
fisherman accused of murdering a white fisherman in a Washington
state coastal village has sold more than 3 million copies and
received the American Booksellers Award and the PEN/Faulkner Award.
</P>
<P>
   But some parents in the town 25 miles northwest of San Antonio
complained of violence and sex in the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got graphic violence, graphic mutilation of a dead boy's
genitals and a graphic sex scene,'' Boerne Trustee Fred Jones said
at a recent school board meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The district initially banned teachers from using the book,
removed it from the library and reprimanded Riley, even though she
had gotten approval from the chairman of the English Department.
</P>
<P>
   The board later voted to put the book back in the school
library, although it is still not allowed for classroom use.
</P>
<P>
   Boerne Superintendent John Kelly said a confidentiality
agreement between the district and Riley prevented him from
answering questions about the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a private, confidential matter, and it is the desire of
both parties, as much as possible, that it stay that way,'' Kelly
said.
</P>
<P>
   John Cole, president of the Texas Federation of Teachers, said
the union hired an attorney to represent Riley in negotiations with
the district.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is free now to go restart her career elsewhere,'' Cole
said of Riley. ``Boerne has lost a good teacher, and another school
district will be lucky to get her.''
</P>
<P>
   Cole and Kelly would not say if the district pressured Riley to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say that after someone has been through something
like this, they may feel their talents are not appreciated where
they are,'' Cole said, ``and they may want to go somewhere where
their talents are appreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was reached Oct. 18. The school district will make
no payments to Riley, other than her normal salary, and Riley
proposed the settlement, according to a statement issued by the
district.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Ms. Riley and the board of trustees acknowledge that
opinions reasonably may differ from individual to individual
whether the use of the book `Snow Falling on Cedars' is appropriate
for a required-reading classroom book, but Ms. Riley voluntarily
stopped using the book when she became aware of concerns regarding
the book's appropriateness,'' the statement reads.

STRIKE AGAINST LARGEST NONUNION TRUCKER TESTS HOFFA 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The teamsters' union strike against the nation's largest
nonunion trucking firm, the Overnite Transportation Co., spread
across the nation Monday, but company officials insisted the strike
was having only a negligible effect on its operations.
</P>
<P>
   The strike, which began at a single Memphis truck terminal on
Sunday, is one of the biggest tests faced thus far by James P.
Hoffa, who became president of the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters last March.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa and other teamster officials said they hoped the strike
would lead to Overnite's granting union recognition to the 8,200
drivers and dock workers at its 166 terminals. If the teamsters
succeed in organizing these workers, it would be one of the biggest
successes in unionizing private-sector workers in decades.
</P>
<P>
   Teamster officials said they had called the strike to pressure
Overnite to cease what they insisted were illegal practices, like
dismissing union sympathizers, in an effort to turn back a
unionization drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This strike is the bitter fruit of Overnite's unrepentant and
unrelenting violations of its workers' federally protected
rights,'' Hoffa said.
</P>
<P>
   Ira Rosenfeld, a spokesman for Overnite, denied that the company
had broken the law in its efforts to resist the 5-year-old
unionization drive.
</P>
<P>
   To keep its business operating, Overnite, which is based in
Richmond, Va., has hired scores of security guards and replacement
drivers. Calling the strike's effects ``negligible,'' Rosenfeld
said: ``We're close to normal. We'll make all deliveries by the end
of today, as scheduled.''
</P>
<P>
   He said 94 percent of Overnite's employees had reported to work
Monday, although he acknowledged that during the strike Overnite
would consolidate its operations and not use all its terminals.
</P>
<P>
   But Dave Cameron, a teamsters' spokesman, said the company was
distorting how severe the strike's effects were. Cameron said that
there were pickets at more than 40 Overnite terminals, and that by
Tuesday there would be picketing at all 166.
</P>
<P>
   He said the teamsters would seriously inconvenience Overnite and
its customers by having teamster members follow Overnite trucks
when they make deliveries to various locations, like hardware
stores. The teamsters plan to picket those sites as the Overnite
truck unloads, a move that union officials predicted could persuade
customers to shun Overnite during the strike.
</P>
<P>
   Overnite officials asserted that many drivers were crossing the
picket lines and that most of the people picketing were teamster
members who did not work for Overnite.
</P>
<P>
   But again, teamster officials had a vastly different version,
stating that, for instance, at the Memphis terminal, only 24 of the
260 workers crossed the picket line.
</P>
<P>
   The union says it represents 3,600 workers at 37 terminals. But
the company argues that because of legal challenges, the union
represents only 1,800 at 22 locations. On Sept. 17, the two sides
broke off negotiations for those unionized workers.
</P>
<P>
   The union has filed hundreds of charges with the National Labor
Relations Board accusing the company of systematically seeking to
block the union by harassing, intimidating and firing workers.
Overnite officials insist all those charges are a public relations
tactic and a pressure tactic intended to force the company to
succumb to the union's demand.

JUDGE HEARS ARGUMENTS OVER EXIT EXAM IN TEXAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ A federal judge Monday began weighing whether the
state's high-school exit exam is racially biased or ``the Cadillac
of exams'' that has helped push Texas public schools to the
educational forefront of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the most challenging decision I've had to
make in the time I have been here,'' U.S. District Judge Edward
Prado said after attorneys for both sides ended their arguments in
the 5-week-old trial debating the Texas Assessment of Academic
Skills test.
</P>
<P>
   Prado, who has been on the federal bench 15 years, is not
expected to rule for at least a month and maybe not until next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund sued the
state more than two years ago, arguing that the test public high
school students must pass to graduate is flawed. They noted that
disproportionately high numbers of Hispanics and black students
fail it.
</P>
<P>
   In education circles nationwide, the case is considered the most
significant education lawsuit to reach the federal courts in at
least the past two decades. It also may have political implications
for Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the GOP front-runner, who has been a
strong supporter of the test.
</P>
<P>
   ``The test discriminates on race,'' said MALDEF lead attorney Al
Kauffman. ``The state has developed and used an invalid test in an
invalid way to deny opportunity to thousands and thousands of
minority students.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the Texas Education Agency, however, contend that
the TAAS test is an integral part of the state's nationally lauded
accountability system and that MALDEF has mischaracterized it as
punishment rather than as a boost to student achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not punishment,'' said Assistant Attorney General
Geoffrey Amsel. ``It's ensuring that they get that core education
... This is a safety net.''
</P>
<P>
   MALDEF not only wants the judge to bar the state from using the
exit test as a graduation requirement. The plaintiffs also want him
to order the retroactive awarding of diplomas to thousands of high
school students who, since 1990, completed all their course
requirements but were denied a diploma because they failed one or
more sections of the TAAS test.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denial of a high school diploma has tremendous consequences,''
MALDEF lead attorney Al Kauffman said in closing arguments. He
reminded the judge of testimony about students who had been
rejected by the military because they didn't pass the TAAS exam.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 400 exhibits filed by both sides and testimony of an
estimated 50 witnesses are reams of data about students who have
taken the test since 1990, how the test is constructed, analyses of
how students have performed as a whole, and how they perform based
on gender, ethnicity, income and other factors.
</P>
<P>
   Amsel argued that ``the vast majority of students pass the test
by the time they graduate,'' and that only 2 percent to 3 percent
of students never pass it. State witnesses testified they believe
there are a number of other factors that explain why some students
never get a diploma, including high absenteeism and failure to
complete required course work.
</P>
<P>
   Kauffman, though, argued that the failure rare of Latinos and
blacks is twice that of Anglos. MALDEF alleges that ultimately 20
percent of blacks and Hispanics fail the TAAS when all their
attempts are counted, compared to 10 percent of whites.
</P>
<P>
   While TEA provided data showing year-by-year passing rates, it
did not provide analyses of overall attempts made by students.
</P>
<P>
   Texas high school students have eight chances to pass the test
while in high school. They may continue to take the test an
unlimited number of times once they have completed their course
work.
</P>
<P>
   MALDEF also argued that minority students are not given the same
opportunity to learn as whites and that they are more likely to
attend schools rated low-performing by the state.
</P>
<P>
   The minority plaintiffs further allege that teachers spend too
much time teaching test-taking techniques to students who have
failed or are at risk of failing the TAAS, depriving them of time
spent on more rigorous academics classes.
</P>
<P>
   Amsel, however, told Prado, ``TAAS is the Cadillac of tests,''
as evidenced by the numerous states who are trying to mimic Texas'
success in setting high education standards and rigorous testing
program.
</P>
<P>
   State witnesses testified that they believe TAAS has raised
student performance and that minorities have been closing the gap
in academic achievement with whites as a result of the TAAS.
</P>
<P>
   Superintendents from across the state, Amsel added, testified
that TAAS ``turned public education in Texas around.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what's going on here is ... they (the plaintiffs) are
trying to paint a frown across a face that's a very happy face,''
Amsel said.
</P>
<P>
   He said if MALDEF were correct in its contention that minority
students do not have the same opportunities to learn as do Anglo
students, the ``dramatic gains'' by minority students on other
nationally recognized tests like the National Assessment of
Educational Progress would not be there.
</P>
<P>
   Prado interrupted closing arguments at several points, asking
the lawyers a variety of questions.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, he asked Amsel if the state is acknowledging a gap
between performance of minority students and that of whites.
</P>
<P>
   Amsel agreed there is a gap but said that it is closing.
</P>
<P>
   In a reference to new state academic skills tests being
implemented, Prado asked: ``Is that why we're now going to have a
new test that is harder? So the gap can go back to the way it
was?''
</P>

BRUINS GET A LIFT FROM ROAD TRIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's time for the annual ``take stock after the road trip''report.
</P>
<P>
   After playing six away games, the Bruins jetted home from the
West on Monday, and after victories over San Jose and Anaheim, they
were pleased and relieved at the way the trip ended. They're now
2-5-4, which isn't great, but in two games they went from the
basement of the Northeast Division to the middle of the pack.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pat Burns said there's still plenty of work to be done but
the 400-pound gorilla is, for the time being, off their backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can get the media off our backs and the fans,'' said center
Jason Allison. ``It's true, you deserve it when you're
0-and-whatever, there have got to be answers, but I don't think
there are big answers for us. I think it is a matter of little
things and little mistakes. I don't think every guy played good
every night, but we were still playing good enough that we could've
been winning games. Hopefully, we went through our bad spell and
now it's done.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant general manager Mike O'Connell said until the club is
firing on all cylinders, it will be difficult to figure out its
strengths and weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to make an assessment because I don't think our team
has played as well, and players individually haven't played as well
as they can,'' said O'Connell. ``(Against San Jose) you saw a
little bit of what the team was capable of doing but even (against
the Sharks), I think there's a lot of room for improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins tied a franchise-worst start with no wins in nine
games (0-5-4). O'Connell said the slow beginning might be
attributable to the youth of the players and their too-comfortable
opinion of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of good things have been said about these young players
and maybe it went to their heads instead of really doing all the
little things it takes to win hockey games this time of year,''
said O'Connell. ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   One factor he wouldn't turn to in terms of explanation, though,
is what some players, and even Burns, mentioned: the absence of
Byron Dafoe, Dmitri Khristich, and Tim Taylor. O'Connell addressed
those who had expressed such opinions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to a number of players about the situation and let
them know where we stand and why we did some of the things we've
done,'' said O'Connell. ``A lot of the players realize they're a
product of the reason we do things the way we do. Every player we
have on our team wants to win. They want to feel like they're being
given the best chance to win. Sometimes they have to understand, we
pick players off waivers and we make deals because of money. Some
of the best deals that have been made in this organization have
been made because of money.''
</P>
<P>
   One example he used was the deal that sent defenseman Glen
Wesley to Hartford for three first-round draft picks. That deal
yielded Sergei Samsonov and Kyle McLaren.
</P>
<P>
   ``To figure out what we have on the team right now is
difficult,'' he said. ``I saw some more positive signs (against San
Jose). I can tell you one thing, our goalie (John Grahame) is as
fine a young goalie as you'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor, said O'Connell, is that some youngsters are
assuming more important roles than they've had in the past. That
brings added pressure, and it takes time for them to adjust.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to be put in different roles,'' he said.
``Players get accustomed to those roles and where they fit in and
how much of a part of this team's success they're going to be. That
is all going to have to be established as well.''
</P>
<P>
   It's only been 11 games, and though there are certainly problems
and several unresolved issues, O'Connell said there's no panic.
Quite the contrary, in fact. Whether he's painting too rosy a
picture remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at the players this team has and the players the other
teams have and I'm very happy and I'm very confident in the talent
level we have,'' said O'Connell. ``It's just a matter of all of the
players playing their best individually so we can play better
collectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Pat said, maybe this is our bad time of year. Every team
goes through tough stretches. Maybe this is our toughest stretch.
If we as an organization see there is a glaring weakness, in talent
or personnel, and we feel everyone is playing as hard as they can
and it just doesn't work, then you'd be concerned. But we haven't
seen that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The fingers are in the dike for now. In time, we'll see if the
Bruins spring another leak.

ISRAEL ORDERS 20 DEPORTED IN CRACKDOWN ON MILLENNIAL PROPHETS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Colo.) (With GAZA-WESTBANK) 
(ms) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Fearing a possible outburst of millennium-related
violence, Israeli authorities rounded up members of two Christian
groups living on the slopes of the Mount of Olives on Monday and
ordered 20 of them deported.
</P>
<P>
   In an overnight swoop, dozens of police officers descended on
Eizariya, an Arab suburb of Jerusalem also known by its biblical
name, Bethany, and arrested 26 men, women and children, mostly
Americans from New York and Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Six Christians were later released and the rest were detained
for deportation, on the grounds that their visas had expired. They
were given 72 hours to appeal the deportation orders.
</P>
<P>
   Their names were not immediately released, but the interior
ministry said they included 13 Americans, three Britons, three
Jamaicans and one Australian.
</P>
<P>
   The police said they had only vague suspicions about the groups,
which were led by two men known as Brother David and Brother
Solomon, who had been living quietly on the Mount of Olives for
several years, promoting their visions of a millennial apocalypse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a general assessment that under certain conditions they
could pose a danger to public safety,'' said Rafi Yaffe, a police
spokesman. ``There was nothing specific.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the third time this year that the Israeli authorities,
concerned that apocalyptic cults might be planning acts of violence
to coincide with the millennium, have ordered Christian groups out
of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Security officials are said to be worried that members of
extreme Christian groups could kill themselves or others, or even
try to blow up Islamic shrines on Jerusalem's Temple Mount in
cooperation with Jewish radicals, in an attempt to hasten an
Arab-Israeli war they see as a necessary prelude to the Second
Coming of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Last January, 14 members of a Denver-based group called
Concerned Christians were rounded up and expelled after officials
said they were planning to commit suicide or die in a shootout with
police in the Old City of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, 25 members of a Christian group from Ireland
who said they were on a pilgrimage were turned away at the port of
Haifa. Israeli officials maintained that they were members of an
extremist sect, but their rough expulsion drew sharp protests from
Ireland, where they are known as a Roman Catholic group that helps
the mentally disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the two groups affected by Monday's crackdown are not
known to have preached violence. They and their followers lived in
rented apartments in Eizariya, choosing the Mount of Olives because
of scriptural passages they believe mark it as the site of Jesus'
return.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Brother David, 58, is a born-again former preacher from
Syracuse, N.Y., and has been in Israel since 1980. Brother Solomon,
65, whose real name is Winston George Churchill Rose, was born in
Jamaica and lived in Brooklyn, and leads a group of
African-American Seventh Day Adventists.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian neighbors of Solomon's group said that members would
often gather on Saturdays and hold prayer meetings punctuated by
loud singing and drum-beating. David's followers would hold similar
services, singing spirituals and speaking in tongues, witnesses
said.
</P>
<P>
   Put on a bus with her four children Monday by police, a follower
of Brother Solomon would only confirm that she was from New York.
``I don't want to say anything,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As the bus pulled out of the police station, the family and
another detained woman aboard lowered the window shades to hide
themselves from photographers.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The latest arrests, which came as Israel is advertising itself
as the prime destination for Christian pilgrims in the year 2000,
highlighted the risk of driving away thousands of potential
visitors: ordinary Christians who believe in the likelihood of a
millennial upheaval but have no plans to hasten it themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Gershom Gorenberg, an Israeli journalist who is writing a book
about millennial groups, said that the police had a public duty to
give a fuller account of their actions against perceived threats of
Christian violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are real reasons for concern,'' Gorenberg said.
``I also think that the Israeli police have a responsibility not to
create a situation in which it seems like Christians in general are
suspect. They have to be more open in explaining their reasons for
telling a particular person or group: you have to leave.''

AS OPPONENTS, GORE AND BRADLEY SHARE MANY SIMILARITIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley
have a lot more in common than either would like to admit to
presidential primary voters.
</P>
<P>
   Each will try to emphasize differences that matter to those
voters when they debate for the first time Wednesday night in New
Hampshire. But in fact, the two Democrats have spent the bulk of
their public service careers as generally liberal members of
Congress, with quite similar approaches to the job.
</P>
<P>
   Their likenesses start with their voting records during
Bradley's 18 years in the Senate and Gore's eight years there,
after serving eight years in the House. Bradley, plainly seeking to
run to Gore's left on issues from health insurance to gun control,
was a bit more liberal in the eyes of old-fashioned liberals and
environmentalists. But to some groups, like the AFL-CIO and
conservative groups, their records appeared almost identical.
</P>
<P>
   But a congressional record, if it means anything at all, is more
than a compilation of votes, and the Bradley-Gore similarities
extend well beyond the yeas and nays.
</P>
<P>
   Each was effective in learning a complex, ``eyes glaze over''
issue and putting it on the national agenda. For Gore, there was
global warming, arms control questions and high technology. ``I
think my work on arms control made a contribution at a critical
time toward the creation of a new consensus on strategic
stability,'' Gore said in a recent interview. And he said his work
on environmental issues also helped to generate a consensus, both
for the Superfund program to clean up toxic waste sites and for
addressing global environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
   For Bradley, there was Third World debt, international trade and
tax simplification. He was central to the 1986 tax reform act that
lowered tax rates and closed loopholes, which he pursued with ``a
single-mindedness that was sometimes irritating to my family,'' he
said in an interview. But in the end, he added, ``It became the
symbol of doing very big things in a bipartisan way.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither man was known in Congress as an orator. But Gore rose to
a dramatic occasion to explain his vote to authorize war in the
Persian Gulf in 1991, when he broke with almost all other
Democrats, including Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia, chairman of the
Armed Services Committee. Bradley was unaccustomedly eloquent the
next year in warning of deteriorating race relations.
</P>
<P>
   Neither was especially chummy with their colleagues, though Gore
had more pals in the House than both of them, put together, had in
the Senate. In the Senate, Gore's run for the presidency in his
first term made him seem presumptuous to some senators, and he was
snidely labeled Prince Albert.
</P>
<P>
   That lack of loyal allies may be one reason why neither had a
striking record of getting laws passed, though each had a few
accomplishments. A more telling reason may be that neither served
long enough to head a committee, though Bradley dealt impressively
with Western water rights as a subcommittee chairman. In a similar
position, Gore first began warning of global warming and the
greenhouse effect.
</P>
<P>
   In a campaign, each will try to make an issue out of past votes,
especially as proof of comparative constancy and sincerity and as
reasons to trust their promises for the future.

CLINTON ORDERS STUDY ON HIGH COSTS OF MEDICINE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton accused the pharmaceutical
industry Monday of ``flat-out falsehoods'' in its effort to stop
his Medicare prescription program and ordered a study on why
medicine costs are so high.
</P>
<P>
   The president lashed out at the industry for running a series of
advertisements in which a fictional senior named ``Flo'' complains
that Clinton's Medicare proposal ``would put big government in your
medicine cabinet.'' He blamed the ad campaign for the inaction by
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot stand by and watch the pharmaceutical industry go on
and distort this debate. We have to expose these deceptions and
give the American people the facts,'' Clinton said during an event
at the Old Executive Office Building.
</P>
<P>
   A key Republican, Rep. Bill Thomas of California, called
Clinton's remarks ``cynical and politically manipulative.''
</P>
<P>
   The 90-day study ordered by Clinton would analyze the cost of
the most common prescription drugs for those people with and
without insurance to determine if people without insurance are
paying a higher tab. It would look at medicine spending trends by
age and income to determine if high drug costs are taking a toll on
seniors and people with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton previously ordered a state-by-state analysis of seniors'
prescription drug needs. He said the studies should ``help lay the
foundation for a more informed debate'' next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the key reasons no action was taken on prescription
drugs this session was because the pharmaceutical industry spent
millions of dollars on an all-out media campaign filled with
flat-out falsehoods,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton suggested high drug costs in the United States forced
seniors who could make the journey to travel to Canada or elsewhere
to purchase the same medicine at much lower prices. He said a
popular drug for lowering cholesterol cost $44 in Canada for 60
tablets and $102 in New Hampshire. ``It's wrong, and we have to
deal with it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Clinton unveiled a Medicare proposal to add a
prescription drug benefit and expand the solvency of the
government's health insurance program for seniors to 2027 from
2015. His plan called for devoting 15 percent of the budget surplus
over 15 years _ $794 billion _ to shore up Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   It would create, for the first time, a Part D prescription drug
program starting in 2002. Beneficiaries would pay an initial
premium of $24 a month and the government would pay half their
prescription drug costs up to $1,000 a year. The premium would
increase to $44 a month and the coverage to $2,500 by 2008. The
poor would be exempt from the premium payment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already pay for doctor and hospital benefits under
Medicare, but we let many of our seniors go without prescription
drugs and preventive screenings that could keep them healthy and
keep them from having to undergo expensive treatment,'' Clinton
said. ``It doesn't make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans countered that it was Clinton who was not making
sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the president's talk today, we should all be concerned,
because the president offered `good' politics and proved once again
how infrequently he associates with the truth,'' said Thomas,
chairman of the House subcommittee overseeing Medicare reform.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, said Medicare premiums for the elderly would double
under Clinton's drug plan. He also cited a study estimating 50
percent to 75 percent of the private companies would drop
prescription drug coverage for retirees or limit their coverage
should Clinton's plan be enacted.
</P>
<P>
   Alan F. Holmer, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of
America president, told The Associated Press that drugs are more
expensive in the United States than Canada because of Canadian
price controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our view is that America has the best health care system in
the world and we don't want to copy the Canadian system with its
rationing of health care, its limits of access to medicines and its
waiting lines that are often three times longer than in the U.S.,''
Holmer said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the industry trade group's ad campaign also was an
accurate description of Clinton's plan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton suggested ``Flo'' and her husband ``Bill'' should go on
television to explain why drug costs are so high. ``I wish they'd
spend this ad money explaining why seniors have to get on the bus
and go to Canada to buy drugs at less than half the price they can
buy them in America, when the drugs are made in America, with the
benefit of the American system and American research and American
tax systems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Republicans were ``squandering a golden moment'' by
leaving more than 13 million people without prescription drug
coverage.

 WASHINGTON: the future.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gore, for example, has criticized Bradley for voting in 1992,
1994 and 1996 for school vouchers that parents could use to pay
private and parochial school tuition. The New Jersey Democrat says
he only supported an ``experiment,'' and today he opposes them.
That quarrel is designed to attract the votes of public school
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Bradley's insistence that he has always been ``a
consistent and unwavering supporter of a woman's right to choose''
whether to have an abortion is aimed at another important
Democratic primary constituency _ voters for whom abortion rights
are the prime issue.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's current position is indistinguishable from Bradley's, but
before he first ran for president in 1987 it was generally
anti-abortion.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, he generally opposed federal funding for abortions
for poor women on Medicaid. In the mid-1980s, the Tennessee
representative regularly wrote to constituents who asked his views
that: ``I have strongly opposed federal funding of abortions. In my
opinion, it is wrong to spend federal funds for what is arguably
the taking of a human life.''
</P>
<P>
   But by the time he was seeking votes in Democratic presidential
primaries in 1988, Gore was equivocating, and by 1992 he supported
his party's position in favored of Medicaid funding for abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The environment is an important point of comparison. Gore has
built much of his reputation in that area, although when it came to
voting records the League of Conservation Voters judged him
``right'' just 64 percent of the time, compared to 84 percent for
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is best known for big concepts, like global warming and the
threat to the ozone layer. The legislative results were not always
dramatic, although he led a successful effort to limit
chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, in the 1990 Clean Air Act and was
deeply involved with the Superfund program in the House. But since
the Clinton administration has not been nearly as dedicated to
those concerns as Gore was as a lawmaker, they sometimes seem to do
the vice president little good today.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is known more for specifics _ for filibustering an
effort to undo federal protection of millions of acres in Utah, for
securing the Sterling Forest preserve in New Jersey and New York,
and, most of all, for the 1992 California water rights legislation.
That law forced farmers to start paying more than a token price for
Central Valley water and made the water available for urban use.
</P>
<P>
   That legislation began as an issue that Bradley said ``I knew
nothing about'' but was his to deal with when he became a
subcommittee chairman. He studied it, held hearings, found allies
and maneuvered the bill into law, using election year pressures to
get President Bush to sign it.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was among an influential band of House Democrats who
threatened in 1983 to oppose deployment of the MX missile unless
the Reagan administration would start talking to Moscow about arms
controls. In the Senate he was among the advocates of reducing the
use of multiple warheads.
</P>
<P>
   One successful legislative effort that brought Gore recent grief
was high technology. In March he said he ``took the initiative in
creating the Internet.'' Republicans laughed him off the political
stage for that one, with Dan Quayle saying that if that was true,
he had invented spell-check. In fact Gore's efforts to promote
supercomputing and high-speed communications networks are
acknowledged by the developers of the process to have played an
essential role.
</P>
<P>
   Today Gore makes his Internet boast in more convoluted language:
``My work on technology included efforts to promote funding for the
technologies that were used by people who expanded early prototypes
of the ARPA-net that later became the Internet.'' He grinned and
added, ``I hope I have buffered that adequately.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's greatest Senate accomplishment was the 1986 tax reform
act that ``nobody in Washington thought would really happen,'' as
he put it in the interview.
</P>
<P>
   Tax fairness was an issue he brought to Washington. ``I had
always been upset by a system where people who were able to use
loopholes paid less than people who did not,'' he said. He put the
idea in a book, pestered colleagues, worked with the Reagan
administration and Sen. Bob Packwood, then chairman of the Finance
Committee, and ultimately lobbied the House by playing basketball
with members in the House gym _ an activity he had avoided since
his election in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   But that was 13 years ago. Since 1986, he said, ``Billions of
loopholes have come back in and rates have gone back up.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley argues that his work on a variety of trade measures,
from the Uruguay Round _ a series of international talks that
resulted in the formation of the World Trade Organization in 1995 _
to the North American Free Trade Agreement, played important roles
in strengthening the economy. And he was an early critic of
Moscow's economic policies in the last days of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   One issue central to his presidential campaign on which he was
almost invisible in Congress is health insurance. In the 1993-1994
fight over President Clinton's plan or various alternatives, the
Finance Committee on which he served was a central battleground. He
explained his inactivity by saying he had followed the lead of Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., the committee chairman, who waited
in vain for Republicans to compromise. ``I was kind of working with
him on this,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   To one longtime observer of Congress, Norman J. Ornstein of the
American Enterprise Institute, what made both Gore and Bradley
``considerably better than average senators'' was their ability to
bring issues to national attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than Pat Moynihan,'' he said, ``I couldn't pick someone
better in the House or Senate to put an issue into play.''

COMMENTARY: STANDING PAT 
</HEADLINE>
  (With BUCHANAN-REFORM, BUCHANAN-ASSESS) 
(DW) 
 By GAIL COLLINS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Patrick Buchanan's formal secession from the Republican Party
lost quite a bit of its drama because of a balky sound system. A
political primal scream requires amplification. One minute the
Buchanan of yore was howling about the New World Order, and the
next he was just like any other slightly flummoxed after-dinner
speaker, betrayed by bad audio-visual aids. (``OK, let me go back
and say we're going to cut those cancerous trade deficits. ...'')
</P>
<P>
   It was what his opponents have always dreamed about _ Pat
Buchanan as a soundless sound bite.
</P>
<P>
   His distress brought back memories of another recently departed
presidential candidate, Elizabeth Dole. During the party's
convention in 1996, Mrs. Dole was given the rather daunting
assignment of humanizing her husband, the presidential nominee. She
did a walking-through-the-audience performance that some people
found remarkably polished and others regarded as achingly
overrehearsed. Her arduous preparation extended to a drill over
what to do if her body microphone suddenly and inexplicably failed,
and guess what? The mike went out. Mrs. Dole extended her hand, an
aide put a replacement in her palm as smoothly as an operating-room
team mid-appendectomy, and on she went.
</P>
<P>
   Chalk one up for overrehearsed women.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the great thing about Pat Buchanan. He makes you feel
good about Elizabeth Dole. In fact, he has a genius for making you
feel great about all sorts of things that normally leave you a tad
depressed. Listen to him announce that ``our vaunted two-party
system is a snare and a delusion,'' and suddenly the two-party
system never looked better. You begin to wonder if we give people
like Al Gore and George W. Bush enough credit.
</P>
<P>
   His followers dwindling, his rhetoric getting old, Buchanan is
becoming the political equivalent of Prozac. When he announces that
this is ``our last chance to save our Republic before she
disappears into a godless New World Order,'' you smile benignly and
begin to plan the dinner menu.
</P>
<P>
   As he bade adieu Monday to the party of Lincoln, Buchanan got a
tad weepy about his happy days working for Richard Nixon and Ronald
Reagan, and then assailed the current crop of front-runners as
``hollow men, the malleable men, willing to read from teleprompter
speeches scripted by consultants and pollsters.'' (Do I see a hand
over there? Yes, you sir. Yes, you are correct. Buchanan's service
to Nixon and Reagan involved the writing of speeches.)
</P>
<P>
   The crux of Buchanan's complaint against the Republican Party
(and a fine party it is) seems to be that Larger Powers have been
plotting to deny him another chance at the presidential nomination
he nearly won from Bob Dole. ``Never again will our political
establishment permit a dissident to come as close to capturing a
nomination as we did in 1996,'' he said bitterly.
</P>
<P>
   This is an interesting theory. Buchanan has probably gotten more
free time on TV and talk radio than all the other presidential
candidates combined _ some weeks he is on the air more than the
weather. The all-powerful global elite has apparently not yet
gotten its hands on the communications industry. About that near
miss in 1996: Pitted against the most inept presidential candidate
since Horace Greeley, Buchanan won the New Hampshire primary and
the Louisiana caucus. Last time I looked, we had 50 states.
Suddenly you understand how Buchanan the historian came to develop
his interesting theories on World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only the Reform Party offers a hope of a real debate and a
real choice of destinies for our country,'' the ex-Republican told
his followers. Translation: Only the Reform Party is desperate
enough to want him.
</P>
<P>
   To get the Reform nomination, Buchanan has to be deemed to be a
serious candidate by the party's leaders next summer, whoever they
happen to be at that moment. Then he and the other serious
candidates run in a mail-in primary conducted with all the rigor of
the Elvis stamp selection. Then everybody will wind up in court.
The Reform Party has mutated into an organization dedicated to the
cause of direct democracy, run by people who are perfectly willing
to keep changing the rules until they get the result they want. Pat
Buchanan seems perfect for them.

 &HT;    Patrols, arrests up as traffic increases
 &HT;    By Henry Farber
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Traffic stops are turning into drug busts for more
cops along I-20 in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Police say they are seizing more drugs than ever on the
east-west route, which originates near the Mexican border and gives
smugglers a straight shot out of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of Miami being the cocaine capital of the world, it's
coming out of Mexico,'' said Capt. Ron Dykes, commander of the
DeKalb County Police Department's narcotics squad.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, Southeastern narcotics shipments have moved from
Florida through Georgia on I-95, I-85 and I-75, all north-south
interstates.
</P>
<P>
   But a decade of South Florida crackdowns by the Coast Guard, Air
Force and Customs Service have forced drug barons to seek other
routes, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Smugglers who once worked mainly by sea and air now are driving
across Mexico, catching I-20 at its westernmost point near El Paso,
Texas. From there, they can head straight into downtown Atlanta to
connect with I-75 and its Detroit-Chicago offshoots or I-85 for a
northeastern run.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the pressure's on in one area, then they move somewhere
else,'' said David Luitweiler, executive assistant to the director
of the DEA.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the detour indicates that the Florida crackdowns
have made an impact, it doesn't necessarily signal a reduction in
drugs on Americans streets, authorities acknowledge. ``The only
thing anybody knows about is what's caught,'' said Agent Joe Long
of the DEA's El Paso intelligence center. No single agency tries to
count how many pounds of drugs are confiscated by local police
departments, which account for most arrests, authorities say.
</P>
<P>
   The DEA does, however, count its drug seizures, and they
document the shift from Florida to the Mexican border states.
</P>
<P>
   Does the I-20 traffic mean more drugs are being pumped into
neighborhoods along the route? Not necessarily, police say. Like
every big city, Atlanta is a major drug market, but most of the
drugs on its bypass highways keep moving up the interstate system.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the illegal cargo can spell danger for interstate traffic
cops, officers say. ``If you're dealing with that level of
violator, the potential for violence is always increased,'' said
Conyers, Ga. Police Chief Tony Lucas, whose officers patrol I-20
east of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Lucas made interdiction a department initiative this
year. He bought two K-9 dogs to sniff out suspicious vehicles and
trained his traffic officers to watch for possible drug runners.
</P>
<P>
   This month, a driver was weaving along I-20 through Conyers. A
patrolling officer was close behind, and his suspicions grew by the
moment. Why was there a tattered dealer's tag on a new-looking car?
And why did the driver freeze up, clenching the wheel, when the
patrol car pulled by his side, even before the siren sounded? After
he stopped the car, the officer wondered what was in a black
garbage bag on the floorboard. With the police station less than a
mile away, a drug-sniffing K-9 dog was rushed to the scene while
the arresting officer stalled the suspect.
</P>
<P>
   A few barks and paw scratches were all the police needed for
probable cause to search the car. Under the bag was 8 pounds of
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   It's the harder drugs Lucas would like to intercept, such as
cocaine and heroin. But another fast-growing concern is
methamphetamine, produced in large Mexican labs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The metro Atlanta area is often known as the methamphetamine
capital of the Southeast,'' said John Andrejko, special agent in
charge of the DEA's regional office.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling the I-20 connection is what authorities call a growing
partnership between Colombian and Mexican drug bosses, who operated
independently for the most part until 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Colombian producers cooperate with Mexican drivers, who
pick up shipments and cross the U.S. border.
</P>
<P>
   That overland route is an alternative to the old Caribbean and
Atlantic crossings, where smugglers are watched by Coast Guard
crews, AWACS aerial surveillance and Federal Aviation
Administration radar. Georgia State Patrol troopers say they have
seized more drugs on I-20 but have seen no let-up on the
north-south routes. ``At one time we saw a drop, but it's back to
running like before,'' said patrol spokesman Gordy Wright. ``With
the volume of traffic now, what law enforcement gets now is just
the tip of the iceberg.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Louisiana police found 24 pounds of Valium in a car
during a traffic stop in Shreveport, the first city east of the
Texas line on I-20. ``A few years ago, about the only thing coming
west to east was marijuana,'' said Louisiana Trooper Don Campbell.
``Now it's everything: cocaine, methamphetamines, prescription
drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   West of Atlanta on I-20, Douglas County Sheriff Tommy Waldrop
agreed: ``You're seeing more drugs everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   In Conyers, Chief Lucas has focused on the drug war as a member
of the narcotics committee of the International Association of
Chiefs of Police.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't put an agent at every mile on the border,'' Lucas
said. ``As long as we're the United States of America, and we
welcome everybody with open arms, then that makes it an easy route
to funnel drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   BOX
</P>
<P>
   In the past three years, more drugs seized by federal agents
originate on the Southwest border (Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and
southern California) as opposed to Florida. Numbers are percentages
of DEA seizures in U.S.:
</P>
<P>
   Cocaine: '97, Fla. 33%; Southwest border states 38%.
</P>
<P>
   Cocaine: '98, Fla, 30%, Southwest border states 47%
</P>
<P>
   Cocaine: '99, Fla, 19%, Southwest border states 68%
</P>
<P>
   Marijuana: '97 Fla.------------ 2.0%, Southwest border 97%
</P>
<P>
   Marijuana: '98 Fla. ------------ 2.5%, Southwest border 97%
</P>
<P>
   Marijuana: '99 Fla. less than 1 %, Southwest border 98%
</P>
<P>
   Heroin: '97 Fla. 41% Southwest border states, 17%
</P>
<P>
   Heroin: '98 Fla. 33 %; Southwest border states, 25%
</P>
<P>
   Heroin: '99 Fla. 34%; Southwest border states 32%

CHINA DETAINS SECT MEMBERS GATHERING FOR A PROTEST 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Defiant followers of the outlawed Falun Gong spiritual
movement tried to mount a protest in Tiananmen Square Monday but
were quickly detained by the police, according to witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Over several hours Monday morning, witnesses said, scores and
perhaps hundreds of followers moved into the square in groups of
two or three. They were invariably questioned and then hustled onto
buses by the police, who apparently had been tipped off.
</P>
<P>
   The willingness of so many people to face certain arrest and
legal troubles is one of many signs that the government's harsh
suppression of the movement _ said to have anywhere from 2 million
to tens of millions of adherents in China _ has not been fully
effective.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, in the southern city of Hangzhou, four of the
remaining leaders of the banned China Democracy Party were put on
trial on subversion charges. Verdicts were not announced, but heavy
sentences are expected, and with these trials and other recent
arrests the authorities appear to have mopped up the last active
remnants of the short-lived alternate party.
</P>
<P>
   The Falun Gong disciples in Beijing wanted to protest the
Chinese Parliament's deliberations this week on a new law intended
to stamp out ``religious cults,'' according to an electronic
message local practitioners sent abroad Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   When they banned Falun Gong in July, the authorities called it a
cult with political ambitions to subvert the power of the Communist
Party. Members insist that it is not political, is only loosely
organized and promotes good citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   But the group's surprise demonstration in Beijing in April _
when more than 10,000 followers surrounded the leadership compound
in a vigil calling for legal recognition _ displayed organizing
power that clearly frightened the Communist authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong is a spiritual theory developed in the early 1990s by
Li Hongzhi, who moved to New York last year. Combining traditional
Chinese qigong, or breathing and exercise techniques, with elements
of Buddhism and Taoism, it claims to harness cosmic forces in the
body, fostering good health and even supernatural powers.
</P>
<P>
   The approach spread wildly among retirees, unemployed workers
and housewives and even many current and former officials. In many
urban parks, groups would meet to practice the exercises that were
said to draw good forces into the body and expel bad ones. Li's
philosophy also argues against drinking, smoking and other vices.
</P>
<P>
   Since the movement was outlawed in July, dozens of senior
officials have been held on serious charges but have not yet been
tried, while hundreds more have been briefly detained. In a report
read on national television Monday night, the government accused
the group's leaders of stealing classified state documents. n
scenes that many Chinese had thought were behind them, high-ranking
followers were forced to make recantations on television, while
crude propaganda claimed that the practice was responsible for
hundreds of deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Many Chinese say they are bewildered by the ferocity of the
government's attack on the movement, which had drawn in millions of
ordinary citizens with no intention of subversion.
</P>
<P>
   Followers abroad have reported dozens of cases in which arrested
members were mistreated by the police, although the accounts cannot
usually be independently verified.
</P>
<P>
   Li was branded a criminal, but the United States has refused to
cooperate with requests for his extradition, and he continues to
communicate with his followers around the world through the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they tackle Falun Gong, security officials have
continued their effort to wipe out any organized pro-democracy
activities.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1998, as President Clinton visited China, a group of
democracy advocates led by Wang Youcai in Hangzhou formed the new
China Democratic Party and called on the Communist Party to allow
an opposition force. By year's end, hundreds of people around the
country had voiced support.
</P>
<P>
   But Wang was charged with subversion and in December was given
an 11-year sentence. Two other longtime dissidents who had joined
in, Xu Wenli and Qin Yongmin, received sentences of 13 and 12 years
each.
</P>
<P>
   Other less well-known activists in several cities around the
country vowed to struggle on, with a group in Hangzhou most active.
But the authorities have gradually imprisoned nearly all the
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, four of the remaining key leaders in Hangzhou _ Wu
Yilong, Zhu Yufu, Mao Qingxiang and Xu Guang _ had a sham trial.
</P>
<P>
   Only two of the men were able to find a lawyer, whom they
shared. Although he had previously promised to help them plead
innocent in court Monday _ apparently under official pressure _ the
lawyer simply appealed for clemency based on their guilt, said Zhu
Chaopu, the younger brother of defendant Zhu Yufu, in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the four was supposed to speak in his own defense, but
each was cut off midway by the judges. Zhu's written speech was
literally torn from his hands by a court officer as he spoke, his
brother said.
</P>
<P>
   In Hong Kong, Lu Siqing, a human rights monitor, said supporters
of the Democratic Party remain out of jail in several cities but at
this point cannot act without being arrested. ``Nearly all the
core, founding members of the party have been arrested and tried or
are awaiting trial,'' said Lu, who runs the Center of Human Rights
and Democratic Movement in China.
</P>
<P>
   In state visits to Britain and France this week, the Chinese
president and Communist Party chief, Jiang Zemin, defended China's
human rights record, reportedly saying that the country was moving
toward democracy but that it must preserve social stability.
</P>
<P>
   But in Paris on Monday the French police briefly detained
protesters outside the offices of Air China who were objecting to
China's record on human rights and press freedoms. The
demonstration followed a larger one on Sunday that attracted some
500 people who demanded independence for Tibet and denounced Jiang
as a dictator.

BUCHANAN BOLTS GOP FOR REFORM PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FALLS CHURCH, Va. _ Trailing badly in his race for the
Republican presidential ticket, Patrick J. Buchanan on Monday left
the GOP and summoned his ``peasant army'' to pursue the Reform
Party nomination _ and its $12.6 million bounty of federal campaign
funds.
</P>
<P>
   The latest victim of Texas Governor George W. Bush's
richly-financed GOP juggernaut, Buchanan cast his repudiation of
the Republican Party as a divine calling ``to rescue God's country
from the cultural and moral pit into which she has fallen.''
</P>
<P>
   The conservative commentator, setting up a possible showdown
with billionaire developer Donald J. Trump, portrayed his Reform
Party candidacy as ``our last chance to save our republic before
she disappears into the godless New World Order that our elites are
constructing.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders, fearing Buchanan could damage the GOP's
quest for the White House, assailed his defection as a selfish act
by a faltering candidate. And GOP leaders wasted little time
attacking Buchanan's recent assertions that the United States may
have rushed too quickly to war with Nazi Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's departure ``is not surprising because Pat obviously
has drifted from the Republican Party and its principles,'' said
Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee.
``Speaking as a veteran, I find his views on World War II both
historically inaccurate and disturbingly misguided.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump, who Monday quit the Republican Party for a possible run
for the Reform nomination, has called Buchanan a ``Hitler lover,''
which Buchanan has angrily denied.
</P>
<P>
   In dropping out of the GOP race, Buchanan joined a parade of
failed Republican hopefuls, including former Vice President Dan
Quayle, former Red Cross chairwoman Elizabeth Dole, former
Tennessee Governor Lamar Alexander, Senator Bob Smith of New
Hampshire, and Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   All were stymied by Bush's vast name recognition and financial
muscle. But Smith was the only other dropout to renounce his GOP
membership, opting to seek the presidency as an independent. Yet
Smith has yet to align himself with a third party as potentially
potent as the Reform movement, as Buchanan did Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only the Reform Party offers the hope of a real debate and a
true choice of destinies for our country,'' Buchanan told about 300
supporters in a hotel outside Washington.
</P>
<P>
   For Buchanan, though, the Reform Party also offers opposition in
the person of Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura, the group's highest
elected official. Ventura, who has designs on the Reform Party
ticket in 2004, has criticized Buchanan's conservative social
agenda and his futility as a GOP candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buchanan is not a winning candidate, and it's time for the
Reform Party to stop running losers,'' said Phil Madsden, a top
Ventura adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan embraced several key Reform issues in announcing his
candidacy, most notably by assailing the two-party system, the
campaign finance laws, and recent international trade agreements.
He called for phasing out foreign aid, erasing the nation's
``cancerous trade deficits,'' and shifting power from Washington to
state and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   But Buchanan also trumpeted his conservative social themes that
clash with more libertarian views held by many Reform members. He
advocated abolishing racial quotas, called for a ``time out'' on
legal immigration, and urged reversal of the Supreme Court ruling
that legalized abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Buchanan all but called for an armed revolt against the
high court. ``As our fathers threw off a tyranny of kings, let us
throw off this tyranny of judges and let America be America
again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Buchanan maintained the support of Lenora Fulani, a
self-described leftist from New York who controls a large bloc of
Reform members. Even though she disagrees with him on ``every
social issue in the history of the world,'' Fulani said after
Buchanan's announcement, she is intrigued by his ability to help
expand the party's membership.
</P>
<P>
   The party's founder, Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot, has yet to
endorse a candidate or indicate whether he may seek the nomination
in 2000. But Pat Choate, who ran as Perot's vice presidential
candidate on the 1996 Reform ticket, said he was ``very confident''
Perot will not run again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless there is some sort of national calamity, like a
depression or a war, he would prefer not to run,'' said Choate, a
Buchanan supporter.
</P>
<P>
   As Buchanan prepared to head to a rally Monday night in New
Hampshire, Choate expressed concern about the Trump/Ventura
alliance, particularly Trump's wealth. ``It's not helpful,'' he
said, ``but it will not keep Pat from getting the nomination.''

MCCAIN (Phoenix) - Arizona Sen John McCain accused Gov. Jane Hull
and the Bush campaign of conspiring to attack him just as the polls
show him catching up to Bush in New Hampshire. At an airport news
conference in Phoenix on Monday, McCain said that Hull, who made
pointed remarks about the Senator's temper and hostility to her in
a New York Times story on Monday, was merely following orders from
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Phoenix Mayor Skip Rimsza, who last week said he
would probably `sit out` the GOP presidential campaign, showed up
at the airport to show the colors for McCain, although he took
pains to say that he `didn't always agree` with him. By KRIS MAYES.
Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
HULL (Phoenix) - Gov. Jane Hull's strained relationship with Sen.
John McCain has emerged from the shadowy world of political gossip
to the status of a full-blown campaign issue after the New York
Times quoted Hull on the front page Monday as saying that his
temper is sometimes out of control. By KRIS MAYES. Story will move
in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
REFORM (Phoenix) - No fewer than 93,000 Arizonans voted for Pat
Buchanan for president in 1996. The question now for the new
convert to the Reform Party is whether he can take a significant
chunk of those voters with him. We talk to Buchanan and Reform
people to see what we can find.
</P>
<P>
   By CHRIS MOESER. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MONTINI-COLUMN (Phoenix) - Three and a half years ago their son was
killed by officers in Joe Arpaio's jail, and now the story of his
death was to receive national television exposure and, yes, Jaron
and Deena Norberg were thankful and, no, they would not be
watching. By EJ MONTINI. Story will move in the ``A'' and ``K''
categories. &QL; 
 &QL; 
AUTO-REVIEW (Phoenix) - From the same people who brought you the
New Beetle comes another brilliant piece of retro design, the Audi
TT Coupe. But where the VW left off with warm-and-fuzzy collective
memories, the Audi begins with styling that is evocative and
purposeful, and performance that makes driving it as much fun as it
looks.
</P>
<P>
   Rounded curves, sharp creases, exposed screw heads and a big,
race-car-style fuel cap are combined into a shape that recalls the
aggressive Auto Union race cars of the 1930s. The TT Coupe also has
something in common with toasters and tea kettles with a look
derived from the famous Bauhaus design school, which took common
objects and redesigned them with an industrial, modern flair. By
BOB GOLFEN. Story will move in the ``L'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
ALLY-ANGST (Undated) - What is it about Ally McBeal that makes us
mad for the sofa whenever she's on? To listen to the big thinkers,
you'd think that any combination of sexual innuendo and a skinny
heroine would pretty much do the trick. They're all working too
hard. The answer is much simpler. Ally McBeal is Jan Brady. Jan
Brady, in fact, is also Felicity. This is the family tree for
vulnerable female angst on TV. And, at the root of it, they're all
Mary Richards. By JAIMEE ROSE. Story will move om the ``E''
category. &QL;

BUSH'S ADS TO HIT AIRWAVES IN N.H., IOWA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ Texas Governor George W. Bush on Tuesday will
launch his first wave of television commercials here and in Iowa
for the 2000 presidential primary, promising to ``pass money back''
to the taxpayers once top priorities such as Social Security,
Medicare, education and the military have been funded.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, the Bush campaign is running four separate 30-second
ads at a rate that the average viewer would see them three to five
times a week, campaign officials said. Some of the footage was shot
when Bush marched in Fourth of July parade in nearby Amherst. The
campaign is also airing a Spanish-language radio spot in Iowa
declaring ``Es en nuevo dia'' _ it's a new day.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush ad called ``priorities,'' which talks about returning
money to the taxpayers, is particularly on point in New Hampshire.
The state legislature has been debating a highly controversial
proposal to institute an income tax in order to pay for a budget
shortfall for education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've signed the two largest tax cuts in our state's history
and we still have no personal income tax,'' Bush says, speaking
directly into the camera. ``I believe we ought to cut tax rates to
continue economic growth and to broaden prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Bush has taken heat for skipping two debates
with his fellow Republicans and for spending fewer days campaigning
here than most of his rivals. He missed last Friday's forum at the
University of New Hampshire because he was attending a fund-raiser
for himself, and another fund-raiser for the GOP, in Vermont. He is
skipping a town meeting session with his rivals, to be held
Thursday at Dartmouth College, because his wife is receiving an
award from her alma mater, Southern Methodist University.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ads appear to have a fairly compelling message,'' said
Todd Harris, the deputy communications director for Arizona Senator
John McCain's campaign. ``I just think the message would be even
more compelling if it was delivered in person by the governor at
any of the forums that he has turned down.''
</P>
<P>
   But Joel Maiola, the New Hampshire director for Bush, said
Monday that Bush would be back in the state next week, spending
time in the North Country _ Dixville Notch, Colebrook, Berlin and
Littleton _ and delivering a major education address.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the ads starting, I think they will give our campaign
further momentum,'' Maiola said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four ads, three are on issues and one is an introduction
to the governor, called ``Successful Leader.'' That spot moves back
and forth from black and white to color, with an announcer
describing Bush as ``the Republican Party's best hope to win the
White House'' and as a ``a fresh start for America.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads will air on WMUR-TV an ABC affiliate in Manchester. Two
other candidates are currently on television, publisher Steve
Forbes and Vice President Al Gore. Bush officials say they expect
to remain on the air through the Feb. 1 primary.

 &HT;    Buchanan launches Reform candidacy
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FALLS CHURCH, Va. _ Lifelong Republican Pat Buchanan bolted
Monday to the Reform Party, urging a ``peasant army'' tired of
Washington politics to catapult him into the White House.
</P>
<P>
   To boisterous cheers of ``Go, Pat, go,'' the thrice-unsuccessful
contender for the GOP presidential nomination declared that his
third-party bid would invigorate America at home and abroad with
``a new patriotism.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Republicans nor Democrats are fighting ``with conviction
and courage to rescue God's country from the cultural and moral pit
into which she has fallen,'' Buchanan told more than 300 supporters
in suburban Washington. He promised to protect U.S. jobs from
unfair trade, fight abortion, keep the nation out of foreign
entanglements, abolish racial quotas, cut taxes and eliminate the
Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   A loser in the 1992 and 1996 Republican presidential primaries,
Buchanan was near the back of the pack in the Republican field
again this year, trailing far behind the frontrunner, Texas Gov.
George W. Bush. He had been mulling switching parties for several
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, I believe, is our last chance to save our republic
before she disappears into a godless world order,'' said Buchanan,
the first to announce his Reform Party candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, billionaire real estate developer and casino operator
Donald Trump moved a step closer Monday to seeking the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   A day after calling Buchanan a ``Hitler lover'' on national
television, Trump changed his Republican voter registration to the
Independence Party. That is the Reform Party's affiliate in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have a lot of experience,'' Trump said, ``more than
most people, more than most candidates. . . . I think I would
represent the Reform Party very well, if I decide to do it. That's
an `if.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Trump has said he believes the Reform Party can carve out a
niche between the major parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Party has just moved too far to the extreme
right,'' he said Sunday. ``The Democrats are too far to the left. I
believe the Reform Party can be the true centrist party.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in a statement, was more critical of Buchanan than in the
past: ``Pat Buchanan is leaving the Republican Party because
Republicans rejected his views during his three failed attempts to
earn the Republican Party's presidential nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   John McCain of Arizona, who had suggested that Bush was
appeasing Buchanan, issued a terse statement Monday. ``I do not
mourn his departure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party nominee will get $12.6 million in federal funds
for campaigning. If Buchanan wins the nomination and if he
participates in nationally televised debates, he could influence
the election, though probably not win, pundits said.
</P>
<P>
   If Buchanan appears poised to capture 10 percent or more of the
presidential vote, it might prompt Bush to select a conservative
vice presidential running mate, said Charlie Cook, a political
analyst for the National Journal, a Washington magazine.
</P>
<P>
   But Cook said he does not anticipate a ground swell of support
for the Reform Party ``with the economy as strong as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The revolutionary impulse (among voters) is really low,'' he
said. ``There are not a lot of people rushing the ramparts yet.''
</P>
<P>
   But Monday, Buchanan tried to stir anti-establishment fervor.
</P>
<P>
   In the pugnacious style he was known for as a conservative TV
commentator, after serving in the Reagan and Nixon administrations,
Buchanan peppered his 30-minute speech with blistering criticism of
the political system he thrived in for three decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our vaulted two-party system has become a snare and a
delusion, a fraud upon the nation,'' Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me say to the money boys and the Beltway elite, who think
that at long last they have pulled up the drawbridge and locked us
out forever, you don't know this peasant army,'' he said. ``We have
not yet begun to fight.'' The crowd responded enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am an admirer of Pat Buchanan,'' said Amityville, N.Y.,
nightclub owner Frank McKay, 32, part of an Independence Party
delegation from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Stewart, a registered nurse who chairs the Independence
Party in Manhattan, said she also planned to call Trump and welcome
him to the Reform Party. Unless Trump announces that he will run, a
decision that could be months away, Stewart said the Reform Party
``will not take him seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry McGuire, a retired Maryland doctor, said Trump ``would be
a great candidate for the emir of Kuwait.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite early sparring between Buchanan and Trump, Stewart said
she is not worried that the candidates' divergent views on topics
such as abortion might hurt the Reform Party. ``The point here is
to bring together divergent people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But outside the hotel where Buchanan spoke, five members of a
group called Shalom International protested what they called the
candidate's sympathetic views about Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   They were upset by Buchanan's recent book in which he contends
the Nazi leader posed no threat to the United States after 1940
because Germany's interests lay to the East.

   PHOENIX - From the same people who brought you the New Beetle
comes another brilliant piece of retro design, the Audi TT Coupe.
But where the VW left off with warm-and-fuzzy collective memories,
the Audi begins with styling that is evocative and purposeful, and
performance that makes driving it as much fun as it looks.
</P>
<P>
   Rounded curves, sharp creases, exposed screw heads and a big,
race-car-style fuel cap are combined into a shape that recalls the
aggressive Auto Union race cars of the 1930s. The TT Coupe also has
something in common with toasters and tea kettles with a look
derived from the famous Bauhaus design school, which took common
objects and redesigned them with an industrial, modern flair.
</P>
<P>
   The TT is the latest in a cadre of playful German sports cars,
joining the BMW Z3, Porsche Boxster and Mercedes-Benz SLK230,
bringing yet another flavor into this diverse group. While it's
tough to pick favorites here, the TT has the edge on all of them in
at least one aspect: the interior is decidedly the roomiest,
especially for an extra-tall driver (such as me).
</P>
<P>
   It's also one of the coolest interiors I've ever seen in a
production car. Intricately designed, it continues the industrial
look of the exterior, with aluminum and brushed-steel rings,
dimpled on the edges, and repeating in functional forms, such as
the air-duct adjustments, the door handles, shifter knob, gauges
and horn ring.
</P>
<P>
   Serious fun stuff, all designed to produce the aura of something
purposeful and highly engineered.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the TT Coupe has the performance to back it all up.
Superb road-holding with a suspension that is supple and
well-controlled, responsive steering, powerful brakes and
aggressive engine power, it's all there, plus a sophisticated feel
that puts it a cut above.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, there will be those who complain that it's not fast
enough, that the small four is just not enough engine, even though
it's turbocharged to produce 180 horsepower, and with minimal turbo
lag. Off-the-line acceleration may be a bit sparse, but midrange
and high-end power is right on the dime.
</P>
<P>
   But for those who think they need more, there will be a
high-performance TT coming out with 225 horsepower and a six-speed
manual transmission.
</P>
<P>
   The TT Coupe is basically a front-wheel-drive car, which also
might turn off some of the hot rodders. The TT driven here was
equipped with Audi's all-wheel-drive Quattro system, which enhances
handling and power delivery tremendously. At $1,750, it's a pricey
option, but worth it.
</P>
<P>
   On an all-day trip along the back roads near Bagdad, Kirkland
and Skull Valley, the TT showed itself to be a great runner,
particularly in terms of fast cornering, hill climbing and sweeping
quickly through curves.
</P>
<P>
   One thing I've learned about driving back roads in Arizona,
anything can happen. Roads that dive headlong into dry washes.
Roads that suddenly turn from smooth asphalt to rocky heaves, or
that are covered with loose sand. The Audi's suspension and drive
system soaked it all up easily, leaving me feeling confident that
it could handle any of it.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, my passenger and I felt secure and comfortable, despite
the challenging drive of more than 200 miles. The ride is nearly as
good as any sedan, despite the short wheelbase and tight
suspension.
</P>
<P>
   The interior feels spacious for the driver and front seat
passenger, but just forget about the rear ``seat.'' It's a cruel
joke where only legless and headless passengers will find any
comfort.
</P>
<P>
   The Coupe is actually a hatchback, and the tailgate has a
bizarre warning label prominently displayed that shows what could
happen if you slam it with someone sitting in the back seat.
</P>
<P>
   Klunk!
</P>
<P>
   One thing you might find lacking in the TT Coupe is the ability
to drop its top. That, too, is coming. So is a Tiptronic automatic
transmission. Currently, only manual is available.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, I think the bottom line comes in at a decent place,
starting at about $30,000 and climbing to about $36,000. Besides
the Quattro at $1,750, there was a comfort package with heated
seats and a trip computer at $700, a performance package of
high-intensity headlamps and 17-inch performance wheels and tires
at $1,000, a premium audio and CD-changer package at $1,200, and a
hands-free mobile phone at $495.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the TT is built on the same platform as the New
Beetle, Jetta and Golf, though with a significantly different
suspension and other architecture. In some ways, it compares to the
new Beetles the way Karmann-Ghias compared with old Beetles.
</P>
<P>
   In other ways, it's like the German equivalent of the Plymouth
Prowler, highly styled with good performance and loads of fun to
drive or be seen driving.
</P>
<P>
   Wonderful style, wonderful engineering, the Audi TT is a super
cool car in every way. I want mine. &QL;

THE REEL LIFE OF PAYNE STEWART 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD ROEPER  
 c.1999 The Chicago Sun-Times  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of the fact that my faith in God is so much stronger
and I'm so much more at peace with myself than I've ever been in my
life.'' _ Payne Stewart, after winning the U.S. Open in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   They got the movie wrong again.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, the drama would begin in much the same way it did
in real life. We open in Florida, where the popular and veteran
golf champion Payne Stewart and two other people board the Learjet
co-owned by Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Destination: Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Pilot and copilot prepare the sleek flying toy for takeoff, and
soon the Learjet is soaring at 500 m.p.h.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart _ famous on the tour for his flamboyant ``knickers''
(often reflecting the NFL colors of the city hosting a particular
tournament) and tam o'shanter hat, basking in the glow of his
dramatic 1999 U.S. Open victory, proud of his morally correct
stance against the recent Ryder Cup rebellion by younger and more
selfish players _ settles back in his seat and relaxes.
</P>
<P>
   Life is good. Great actually. In the movie, they want to
illustrate his thoughts in an obvious way, so Payne takes out his
wallet and gazes fondly at a snapshot of wife Tracey and children
Aaron and Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   At 42, he's never felt such inner peace.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to the cockpit, and cue the heartstopping music. Something
has gone terribly wrong, possibly a pressurization failure, and
soon the pilot and co-pilot will be rendered unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   The Learjet is hurtling through the skies at frightening speed
with no one at the controls. Imagine a runaway train in the clouds.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground, air traffic controllers are unable to establish
communication with the private jet that is climbing to a deadly
altitude of 45,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   By now the media have begun sniffing out the story. Regular
bulletins from the AP, raw live reports on the news channels, a
sudden flurry of phone interviews with retired pilots and FAA
officials and transportation experts. It's not yet a tragedy, but
it's a ``possible tragedy,'' according to the somber-faced anchors.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force F-15 fighter jets and later Air National Guard F-16s
are dispatched to accompany the wayward plane, which is now heading
over the heartland.
</P>
<P>
   Time is running out.
</P>
<P>
   But in a scenario that we've watched in a dozen films, a savvy
air traffic controller and a veteran pilot on the ground are able
to talk Stewart through the paces of steadying the aircraft and
landing it safely.
</P>
<P>
   Or, in the tradition of midair stunt magic from the likes of
``Air Force One'' and ``Executive Decision'' and ``Passenger 57''
and ``Con Air,'' an Air Force pilot manages to board the Learjet in
midair, defying the odds and all laws of science, and saves the day
just in time.
</P>
<P>
   That's what you'd get at the movies. A happy, implausible,
wildly exciting denouement. The impossible, once again, rendered in
somewhat believable terms.
</P>
<P>
   But life is messy. Life laughs at the movies. And as we've seen
so many times before, there is no celebrity immunity from sudden,
bizarre, deadly accidents.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, the paparazzi chase Princess Di and Dodi Fayed
into the Pont de l'Alma tunnel and there's a terrible crash _ but
miraculously, she escapes unharmed, and uses that miracle as her
gateway into an anonymous, blissful existence far removed from the
spotlight. She marries, I don't know, a social worker. Some good
guy with no money.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, John Kennedy Jr.'s plane goes down in the water,
but he and his wife and her sister cling to a piece of the wreckage
and are rescued by the search team.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, Janis wakes up with the worst hangover of her life
and swears off the booze; Jimi doesn't suffocate on his own vomit;
Marilyn says ``Who needs the Kennedys?'' and throws herself into
her work.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, Elvis comes out of the bathroom and says, ``Man, I
gotta get in shape, I feel like hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Carole Lombard and Glenn Miller and Roberto Clemente and Thurman
Munson and Jim Croce and Buddy Holly _ they don't die in plane
crashes in the movie version. They're the heroes of the story, they
can't go out that way.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, Payne Stewart and his fellow passengers do not
succumb to oxygen deprivation. There's nothing unique or exciting
or dramatic about that; it's just horribly unlucky, and terribly
final.
</P>
<P>
   Not only can life be coldly indifferent, it often has absolutely
no sense of story arc. No wonder we go to the movies to escape.

 &HT;    COLUMN: With Trump in wings, things could get lively
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This country gets along most of the time with two parties,
largely because that's all our system of government needs to
operate.
</P>
<P>
   Administrations can't be dissolved on a vote of confidence,
promoting the organized factionalism found in a parliamentary
system. The Constitution sharply demarcates a difference between
the executive and legislative branches and assumes a degree of
independence on the part of lawmakers that discourages much party
formation.
</P>
<P>
   While not mentioning party at all, the framers designed a
legislative system that lends itself to minimalism, and all 50
states are organized similarly. This year, however, there are other
factors at play, creating new incentives to go off the two-party
reservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have rearranged the primary schedules and rigged the game
to protect the party favorites,'' Pat Buchanan said as he threw his
hat into the Reform Party ring Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the primary schedules have been affected more by
competition among the states than any concerted effort to rig the
game. But the effect is identical. The speeded-up schedule wouldn't
even give Buchanan a lot of C-SPAN time in a GOP race, much less a
realistic shot at the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the spadework done by Ross Perot in his last
two races added a big incentive to bolt, in the form of more than
$12 million in federal matching money the Reform Party nominee will
receive.
</P>
<P>
   To lay hands on that money, Buchanan may have to vie with Donald
Trump, who got things off to a congenial start over the weekend by
calling Buchanan a ``Hitler lover'' on national television. But
that beats taking a number to wait for a shot at George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Trump has no financial incentive to seek the nomination _ he has
already said he'd turn down the $13 million _ but a decade of
rich-guy candidates has apparently sparked him to consider getting
in the act as Jesse Ventura's tag-team partner.
</P>
<P>
   On the Jersey side of the George Washington Bridge, there's
currently a billboard advertising Trump's Atlantic City casino
which says: ``He's got it. You want it. Come get it.''
</P>
<P>
   That says enough about the prospective candidate to set fight
fans salivating at the thought of him sparring with the pugnacious
Buchanan in suburban hotel ballrooms across America, a club match
series if there ever was one. But the rules for the Reform Party
nomination are so complicated that it isn't clear just how their
competition will take shape, aside from a lot of name-calling.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it clear to whom it really matters. Buchanan on Monday
invoked his ``peasant army,'' calling on the memory of his success
four years ago in the New Hampshire Primary with an anti-NAFTA,
populist message.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, it's no peasant, but Perot, who gives
Buchanan his greatest advantage, and there will be no New Hampshire
Primary to serve as a rallying point for his pitchfork-wielding
followers. In a literal way, Buchanan and Trump, if he runs, will
be making this up as they go along.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - What is it about Ally McBeal?
</P>
<P>
   She's been huge right from the start. The pilot aired, viewers
fell in love, the media swooned. Creator-writer-producer David E.
Kelley was given Emmys. David E. Kelley was given more shows to
write. David E. Kelley was given a raise.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``Ally McBeal`` finished its sophomore season as a Top
20 show, tied with the serious and deeply respected ``Law &AMP;
Order.'' All this despite the fact that Ally is a ditzy lawyer in
short skirts working in a ditzy law firm with unisex bathrooms on
the fourth network.
</P>
<P>
   Big thinkers (Is-this-the-death-of-feminism? on the cover of
``Tim''e), not to mention competing network executives, have spent
a lot of time trying to figure it out. To listen to the noise,
you'd come away thinking that any combination of sexual innuendo
and a skinny heroine would pretty much do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   They're all working too hard. The answer is much simpler.
</P>
<P>
   Ally McBeal is Jan Brady.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Brady, in fact, is also Felicity.
</P>
<P>
   Felicity, of course, is also Ally, even earning the nickname
``Ally McBeal goes to college'' from ad executives who screened the
program first.
</P>
<P>
   It's basically the family tree for vulnerable female angst on
TV. And, at the root of it, they're all Mary Richards.
</P>
<P>
   There's something about a character so tormented by her
expectations, so vulnerable yet strong, so able to conquer the
world, if only we'd let her, that makes us really want to learn how
to program the VCR.
</P>
<P>
   And there is comfort in their craziness. We always know that, no
matter what, Ally is going to do something way dumber in that hour
than we did today. We know that Jan will never live up to Marcia,
that Felicity will never be tranquil, that Mary will never be
married.
</P>
<P>
   That's what keeps us coming back for more. Miserable but likable
characters make for great TV; they always have. Think for a moment
what it would be like if Jan had high self-esteem, if Ally settled
down, if Felicity were calm or if Mary were celebrating her fifth
wedding anniversary: We'd just have to hate them.
</P>
<P>
   Or, more accurately, hate her, since she's all the same person.
</P>
<P>
   Need evidence? Hip apartments are always yearned for, success
with boys is always questionable, and authority figures, whether
they be parents, courtroom judges or Lou Grant, are always bemused
by the struggle. There's always a best friend: Rhoda, Renee, Sally.
(Jan didn't have one on-screen, but that's because there were too
many Bradys to keep up with already.)
</P>
<P>
   Our character always has her personal trademarks. For Jan, it's
the desperate ``Marcia, Marcia, Marcia.'' Felicity is talking into
her tape recorder. Ally is dancing _ in the bathroom, with the
baby, in the courtroom, to a hallucination of Al Green. And Mary
has that hat toss.
</P>
<P>
   Bathrooms will always play a big role in our girl's life. Ally
kicks in stalls in the unisex, Jan fights with Marcia over their
unisex, and Felicity decides in a bathroom not to have sex. Mary,
we're sure, used it once or twice, but they didn't show toilets on
television in the '70s. (All we ever saw of the Bradys' latrine was
the sink.)
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the pajamas. You've gotta see a girl in
pajamas if you really are going to know her. So of course, we have.
Remember the Brady girls at bedtime? Hair perfectly brushed
(Marcia's was shinier), beds perfectly turned down, nightgowns tied
to their chins. Mary wore nighties but was embarrassed to be seen
in them. Felicity makes do with a tank top, but Ally's sheep
pajamas are a store knock-off legend.
</P>
<P>
   And, as with most things in the '90s, you can trace the
evolution of the societal function of coffee through our girls.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Jan didn't drink coffee because she wasn't old
enough. We know Mike and Carol drank plenty of it because Alice
always had some made. We can be sure that Marcia drank coffee
before Jan, and there probably would have been an entire 30-minute
episode about it if the show had lasted long enough.
</P>
<P>
   The much-older Mary drank loads of coffee with her friend Rhoda.
They drank it at home, in the tiny kitchen or at the table, and it
was still the nothing-special comfort brew of a pre-Starbucks
universe.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward 20 years to Felicity, and you've got a college
student working in gourmet coffee shops. You don't have friends
over for coffee anymore. You go out. You drink it at as early an
age as is possible. And a cup will cost you as much as a whole can
used to.
</P>
<P>
   And once you reach the age of Ally, coffee's an art. She drinks
her first cup, generally a latte, cappuccino or other formal name,
in a ritualistic, highly sexual manner. Plain black coffee is so 10
years ago. So are mugs. Now you have to have java jackets.
</P>
<P>
   Our girls are all strong in their element. Jan and Felicity are
great students. Mary was a terrific producer. Ally can win cases in
court, as long as they're not too serious.
</P>
<P>
   And there will always be something about our characters that
we'll envy. Jan had Alice _ we'd kill for those cookies after
school. Felicity had that very cool hair (she's cut it now, but it
will grow back). Ally gets to go every night to that really cool
bar that would never exist in real life. And we all wanted the M on
Mary's bedroom wall.
</P>
<P>
   But we'll always really pity our girls because we know that if
they could ever get over the angst and truly empower themselves,
just like we're going to do right after we finish watching
tonight's episode of ``Ally McBeal,'' they'd conquer the world.
</P>
<P>
   For the sake of laziness, we're hoping this is never going to
happen. We don't want the show to end. &QL;

DOCUMENT MAY FORCE DE KLERK, BOTHA TO TESTIFY 
</HEADLINE>
 AFRICA-TRUTH-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ Minutes from a high-level government meeting
submitted to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission on Monday
provide the most convincing evidence yet that F. W. de Klerk and P.
W. Botha, the last two white presidents of South Africa, were
directly involved in decisions to assassinate prominent
antiapartheid activists.
</P>
<P>
   The document, a record of the secretive State Security Council
from the early 1980s, could finally force Botha and de Klerk, who
have long frustrated the commission with reticence and denials, to
explain their knowledge of gross human rights violations committed
on behalf of their governments.
</P>
<P>
   The men, neither of whom have applied for amnesty from the
commission, are still vulnerable to prosecution on the basis of new
evidence of criminal conduct.
</P>
<P>
   But it is still uncertain if the two former presidents will be
called again to testify. The minutes were brought before the
commission's amnesty committee by the lawyers for the family of
slain activist Matthew Goniwe, who was killed with three colleagues
in a 1985 roadside ambush near Port Elizabeth. The committee is now
considering whether to accept the new information filed under an
application for late evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the committee grants the application, the commission will
have to inform all those implicated by the evidence,'' said Phila
Ngqumba, a spokesman for the commission. ``But there is no
ambiguity: The minutes show that the State Security Council took a
decision to kill Goniwe, and the state president chairs the
council.''
</P>
<P>
   During the official lifespan of the commission, from April 1996
to July 1998, Botha and de Klerk successfully eluded full
disclosure. Botha, state president from 1978-89, defied three
subpoenas to appear before the commission, and then successfully
appealed against a court conviction for doing so. He has
consistently derided the panel as a ``circus'' and a ``witchhunt.''
</P>
<P>
   De Klerk, who held important Cabinet posts before following
Botha into office, appeared before the commission twice, portraying
himself both times as shocked and surprised to hear about the
crimes committed in the name of apartheid. ``I'm convinced that
people in superior positions were kept in the dark, and they were
not being told what was happening,'' he said in testimony before
the commission in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   His denials have cost de Klerk, who won international accolades
for lifting the ban on liberation movements like the African
National Congress and freeing Nelson Mandela from prison.
Commission Chairman Archbishop Desmond Tutu said over the weekend
that had he known the former president's true character, he never
would have recommended him to share the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize with
Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   While the commission concluded its general hearings into human
rights violations last year, its amnesty committee continues to
operate. Several former security branch police officers from Port
Elizabeth have applied for official amnesty in connection with the
killing of the Cradock Four, a group of prominent antiapartheid
activists who were run off the road late one night, hauled into the
bush, and slain with grotesque brutality. Among them was Goniwe, a
charismatic young leader of the ANC.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ngqumba, the minutes of the State Security Council,
a shadowy inner Cabinet of Botha's government that included de
Klerk as one of its members, indicate that the police commissioner
at the time, Johan Coetzee, and apartheid hitman Craig Williamson
were instrumental in planning the Cradock Four murders.
</P>
<P>
   If the amnesty committee accepts the State Security Council
document as new evidence, Botha, de Klerk, and others implicated
could be called to testify, or even face prosecution.

 &HT;    Georgia among states with lower teen birth rates
 &HT;    By Raven Hill
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The teenage birth rate has fallen since 1991, with
the sharpest decline among black women, the federal government said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The decline was due mainly to three factors, according to Health
and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala:
</P>
<P>
   _ A fear of contracting AIDS and other sexually transmitted
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   _ A growing rejection of casual sex.
</P>
<P>
   _ Welfare reform laws that sent a message to young men about
child support obligations.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, there were 51.1 births last year for each 1,000
women aged 15 to 19, the department said. That was down 18 percent
from a rate of 62.1 in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the improvement was due to a 26.1 percent decline in the
same period among black teenagers and a 12.2 percent decline among
Hispanic teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, teen births fell almost 12 percent from 1991 to
1997. The birth rate for the state's black teens was 92.6 per 1,000
teenage women, compared to a national rate of 88.2. For Hispanic
teens, the rate was 125.9 statewide and 97.3 nationally.
</P>
<P>
   The figures give some hope to efforts targeting teenagers, said
Isabel Sawhill, president of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen
Pregnancy. ``Lower rates of teen births are a result of less sex,
more contraception and a growing recognition among teens themselves
that their focus should be on education and growing up,'' she said
at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Shalala said: ``We believe the strength of teen pregnancy
programs is working in local communities.'' Teens need help
negotiating their way through the pressures of engaging in risky
behavior, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Communities must take the initiative in reducing teen
pregnancies, Sawhill said, using programs tailored to their needs.
She said sex education in the schools is insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy
released a manual to help communities design successful prevention
efforts. It contains the latest research on teen pregnancies and
provides strategies for after-school activities and building
fund-raising coalitions, Sawhill said.

20 FROM EVANGELICAL GROUP AWAITING `END OF DAYS' ARE DETAINED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M.   SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israeli security forces in combat gear carried out a
predawn raid on the Mount of Olives Monday, detaining 16 Americans
and four others from a Christian evangelical group and prepared to
deport them for ``endangering public safety.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the third such move in recent months by Israeli officials
against Christian groups who interpret the Bible's more apocalyptic
passages literally and believe the Second Coming of Jesus is at
hand on the eve of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the 20 people, including four children, members of
two organizations called the ``House of Prayer'' and the ``Temple
group,'' were arrested for overstaying their visas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of them believes he will be given a certain role at
the End of Days,'' said police spokesman Rafi Yaffe, who said
deportation proceedings were underway. ``We are fearful that their
presence in the country could lead to the endangering of public
safety.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether they had been charged with anything
besides overstaying visas. US Embassy spokesman Larry Schwartz said
the names of those detained would not be released under privacy
laws, but confirmed that 16 were American citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli security forces have been bracing for what they fear
will be a rash of violence and possible mass suicide attempts tied
to millennial prophecies. Dozens of undercover agents, police
sources say, have been penetrating a network of evangelical
organizations that have been gathering in Jerusalem, and
specifically at the Mount of Olives, where Christian faith holds
that Jesus ascended to heaven after being crucified.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these groups cite passages in the New Testament that
refer to ``The End of Days'' as a time when the Messiah will return
to the Mount of Olives to judge the living and the dead.
</P>
<P>
   The tactics used by Israeli security forces and border police
Monday, which eyewitnesses said involved strip-searches of both men
and women, troubled many Christians living in Israel as well as
Israelis who follow the Christian community closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry if this means they are going to go around arresting
anyone who believes in the Christian theology of the return of
Jesus Christ,'' said David Bogenrief, a member of a Baptist parish
who had joined prayer services with many of those arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Israeli authorities have no understanding of these
Christian groups. I think they are acting out of fear, and not
acting rationally,'' said Bogenrief, an Iowan who has lived in
Israel on and off for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   One witness, Charle Homan, a nondenominational minister from
North Carolina, was in an apartment shared by The Prayer Group when
it was raided at about 1:30 a.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
   She said more than 40 Israeli border police in bullet-proof
vests and wielding machine guns burst in. She said she was
strip-searched by a female officer while others tore the apartment
apart and seized bags of full of Bibles, prayer cards, and
documents. At least three of her housemates were taken away in
manacles, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was petrified. The soldiers seemed to be working off a list,
and my name was not on it, thank God,'' said Homan, a mother of
four children and a former computer technician who came to Israel
last week.
</P>
<P>
   One of those detained was ``Brother David,'' a New York native
who two weeks ago led the nightly services of ``The Prayer Group''
on the Mount of Olives and, in interviews, described his colorful
and sometimes apocalyptic theology.
</P>
<P>
   Brother David, an evangelical, nondenominational Christian, said
he had come to Israel 15 years ago. He earned a reputation in
Bethany, where he lived, as a pastor who cared for the poor and
helped Christian pilgrims settle in the Mount of Olives.
</P>
<P>
   During the Wednesday night prayer service, about 20 people sat
in chairs in a circle and read from passages in the Bible that
included Revelations and Ezekiel and Zechariah. They sang hymns,
shook tambourines and praised the Lord. All use only first names,
such as Brother Raymond, who told how he became a ``born-again
Christian'' after spending 12 years in American prisons. And Sister
Sharon, who said that ``God dispatched me'' from Iowa to carry out
a ministry in the Mount of Olives. They prayed, but there was no
discussion of violence or suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond and Sharon, neighbors said, were arrested Monday along
with Brother David.
</P>
<P>
   Brother David said he had ``ripped up'' his passport and would
refuse to leave Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hallelujah, the King of Kings is coming here! I believe
that!'' Brother David told his congregation. ``I believe we are
very close to the coming of Our Lord. We are in the right place at
the right time. But we can't just stand here. We have a
responsibility, every born-again Christian has a responsibility, to
let the people know, to warn them of what is coming so they can
prepare.''
</P>
<P>
   Gershom Gorenberg, a writer who follows religious extremists and
millennialist trends for the Jerusalem Report, Israel's leading
English-language magazine, said he has met Brother David and the
community and believes that, in the absence of hard evidence
against the group, the police may have overreacted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a clumsiness in the handling of this that should
raise questions,'' said Gorenberg. ``The main question is whether
confrontational police tactics are the right way to approach groups
which may actually become more radicalized as a result of such
confrontations?''

MEETING THOSE MEDIEVAL GUYS IN THE FRIARS CLUB 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for times.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some of the best Friars Club members are, technically, dead.
</P>
<P>
   And yet they're probably still tapping out a cigar ash somewhere
and saying, ``But seriously, folks.''
</P>
<P>
   The age problem isn't exactly a revelation to the organization.
In a cable special Tuesday, a Friars member concedes, ``I've seen
younger faces on money.''
</P>
<P>
   So the club for showbiz types seems to be banking on a little TV
exposure this week to invigorate itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let Me In, I Hear Laughter: A Salute to the Friars'' is a
one-hour documentary on Cinemax. And on Wednesday, Comedy Central
has an hourlong special of its own, a Friars Club roast of comedian
and actor Jerry Stiller.
</P>
<P>
   The fright-week timing is bizarrely appropriate. I haven't seen
the Stiller roast, but the cumulative effect has to be downright
scary.
</P>
<P>
   The Cinemax documentary gives us a musty little club where time
stands still and the likes of Milton Berle, Steve Allen, Red
Buttons, Jan Murray, Pat Cooper, Alan King, Buddy Hackett, Jack
Carter and Norm Crosby crack one another up.
</P>
<P>
   Larry King, too. ``I've never come to the Friars where I didn't
feel good,'' he says. Of course he hasn't. The other members call
him ``kid.''
</P>
<P>
   The famous personality roasts at the Friars Clubs in New York
and Los Angeles were traditionally private affairs _ no cameras
and, for that matter, no women either _ so there isn't much to
show.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few clips, and some profanity-laden audiotape, but
we're assured that the Friars Club roasts were the source of ``some
of the greatest wit that you've ever heard'' (Buttons), replete
with ``brilliant'' humor (Murray).
</P>
<P>
   By way of demonstration, Buttons pulls out a handful of index
cards with his own jokes from a Hugh Hefner roast.
</P>
<P>
   In card one, Buttons describes Hefner as ``a man who once said
to Richard Simmons, `So OK, read the articles.'''
</P>
<P>
   On card two, Hefner is ``a man who convinced Anthony Quinn that
condoms are for sissies.''
</P>
<P>
   Take a moment. I'll stop and wait. Pick yourself off the floor
and catch your breath.
</P>
<P>
   Moving right along, that reminds me of the time _ no kidding,
folks _ when the Friars roasted Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball at the
Beverly Hilton Hotel, and a comic who called himself Parkyakarkus
was so funny that he killed.
</P>
<P>
   So Parky finishes his act, goes back to his seat at the dais and
parks his carcass. Then he slumps over and, well, dies. Right
there.
</P>
<P>
   There's a commotion in the room. Art Linkletter grabs the
microphone and asks if anyone in the crowd is carrying
nitroglycerin to jump-start Parky's heart.
</P>
<P>
   To Linkletter's astonishment, half the people in the room start
waving their bottles of nitro tablets.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Berle nudges the singer Tony Martin and tells him
quick, sing something. Anything to take the audience's minds off
this terrible thing that's just happened.
</P>
<P>
   Martin obliges. He stands up and sings his hit, ``There's No
Tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   But seriously, you've been a wonderful audience, ladies and
germs. I hope you've enjoyed yourselves. Good day, and come back
soon.

</P>
<P>
   ``GODFORSAKEN SEA'' &QL; 
By Derek Lundy (Algonquin, $22.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The open ocean might look tranquil on any given day, but smart
sailors never forget what Herman Melville called ``the tiger heart
that pants beneath it.'' There have been many adventure-at-sea
books released over the last two years, but we hope you haven't had
your fill because this one is terrific. In Lundy's prologue, he
describes the deep fear that came to him during his first trip
across the open sea in a small sailboat, with just his wife along.
Their goal was to reach the Virgin Islands, but in his heart Lundy
knew that they would make it ``only if the ocean let us through.''
He admits that some of that fear lingers even today when he goes to
sea in a small boat, which makes the subject of his book seem
logical: the Vendee Globe round-the-world race, an astonishing
competition in which participants sail alone for 27,000 miles, more
than half of it through the most dangerous waters in the world (the
Southern Ocean), sometimes taking as long as five months to finish.
Lundy focuses on the 1996-97 race, in which 16 skippers _ 14 men
and two women _ faced severe storms and life-threatening
conditions. One disappeared altogether, and several were rescued
from the freezing water after their boats ran into trouble. The
most dramatic rescue was that of Raphael Dinelli, whose boat
capsized, then righted itself briefly before it went down (a
freezing Dinelli lashed himself to the awash deck, then jumped into
a life raft minutes before the boat sank). His only hope of rescue
from the icy water was Pete Goss, a British competitor who was
caught in the same storm 160 miles downwind. When race authorities
contacted him, Goss immediately abandoned the race and battled for
30 hours through ferocious conditions to reach Dinelli, without
even knowing if he was still alive (yes, but barely). This tale of
heroism, not to mention superb sailing, has a sweet ending: Dinelli
lived, and he and Goss became close friends. If you couldn't get
through Sebastian Junger's ``The Perfect Storm,'' try this one.
It's wonderfully written by someone who knows what it's like to be
alone in a wilderness of wind and waves. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
``ETHEL &AMP; ERNEST'' &QL; 
By Raymond Briggs (Knopf, $21) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   See those people on the cover? You know them. They are Ethel and
Ernest, but you know them by other names. That's what makes this
book so enchanting. It's possible to read it in one sitting,
because it is _ don't panic, please _ a comic strip. Raymond Briggs
is a British illustrator of children's books (``The Snowman,''
``Father Christmas''). He is also the son of Ethel and Ernest
Briggs. Here he imagines his parents' lives from the moment they
first saw each other in 1928 (she was a maid, he was about to
become a milkman) to their deaths nearly 50 years later. Their
conversations over the years reflect world events, from the rise of
Adolph Hitler to the invention of television. They also reflect
things that are not so common today but that we remember in so many
people who are now gone _ modesty, simplicity, an appreciation for
what one has and a stoic acceptance of the troubles life delivers
to one's door. This is Briggs' love letter to his parents. It's not
overly sentimental, just real and wistful and true. Enjoy. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
``THE BOOK ON THE BOOKSHELF'' By Henry Petroski (Knopf, $26) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Petroski (``The Evolution of Useful Things'') is an engineer who
has carved a rather charming literary niche for himself by paying
minute attention to objects that don't seem to deserve it. Pencils.
Paper clips. Zippers. In keeping with that tradition, we read the
title of this book and thought that it might be about the physical
properties of books _ spines, paper, type. We were wrong. It's
about the physical properties of bookshelves. Think about it:
Books. Bookshelves. As subjects go, one suffers by comparison.
Petroski, however, is undeterred. He studies the function and
history of shelves because, he says, ``looking afresh at and
thinking anew about the bookshelf, like looking or thinking from
scratch about anything found or made, brings its own rewards, not
the least of which are fresh new ways of encountering and
experiencing the world.'' We preferred the view from Anne Fadiman's
delightful ``Ex Libris,'' in which the shelves are pretty but the
books get equal time. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
``DIEGO RIVERA'' &QL; 
By Pete Hamill (Abrams, $49.50) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, Pete Hamill traveled by bus from New York to Mexico
City to study art under the GI Bill. He was 21 and, he says, ``in a
daily state of exhilaration.'' He sought out the work of the great
Mexican painters and found in the canvases of Jose Clemente Orozco
and Rufino Tamayo a reason to alter his plans _ within a year, he
had lost his nerve and decided to become a writer, too overwhelmed
by the Mexican artists to paint pictures of his own. But what of
Diego Rivera, the great Mexican muralist? The young Hamill found
him to be ``clenched and stiff . . . hopelessly dated, someone out
of the 1930s.'' Thirty years later, when Hamill visited an exhibit
in Mexico City that celebrated the 100th anniversary of Rivera's
birth, his interest was reborn. For the first time, he says, he
could see what a great painter Rivera had been. This handsome and
engaging book, with photographs and reproductions of Rivera's work,
is both a biography and an analysis of the painter's art and its
effect on an entire country. ``The daughter of an industrialist and
the son of a farmer could look at the work of Diego Rivera and
recognize Mexico,'' says Hamill. ``He is like some great writers,
from Charles Dickens to William Faulkner to Gabriel Garcia Marquez:
the insistence on the value of the local leads to the universal.'' &QL;

COMMENTARY: THE STORY OF K  
(DW) 
 ANTHONY LEWIS  
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The classic story of a man destroyed by faceless
accusers, Franz Kafka's ``The Trial,'' begins as follows: ``Someone
must have slandered Joseph K., because one morning, without his
having done anything wrong, he was arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   It is bedrock American belief that nothing like that can happen
here. No one can be held in prison for years without knowing
exactly what the accusations are, without having a chance to
confront his accusers.
</P>
<P>
   But it does happen here. The Immigration and Naturalization
Service over the last several years has acted to expel about two
dozen aliens from this country on the basis of evidence that they
were not allowed to see. Many of them were, and are, imprisoned
while trying to fight the phantom of secret evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The danger of letting the government use secret evidence has now
been dramatically illustrated in one of the immigration cases, that
of Hany Kiaraldeen. He is a 31-year-old Palestinian who has lived
in the United States since 1990 and is married to a U.S. citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Kiaraldeen was detained by the INS in March 1998 and has been in
a county jail in New Jersey ever since. The INS accused him of
having connections to terrorists, including one involved in the
1993 bombing of the World Trade Center. But it would not tell him
or his lawyers the basis for that charge.
</P>
<P>
   The INS presented classified material in secret to an
immigration judge, Daniel Meisner. All that Kiaraldeen was given
was ``summaries'' identifying no sources. No witnesses were called
to testify, so none could be cross-examined.
</P>
<P>
   Meisner, having read the secret material, concluded that an
evaluation of it ``by a person of ordinary prudence and caution
cannot sustain a finding that [Kiaraldeen) has engaged in terrorist
activity.'' When the INS appealed, two separate three-judge panels
of the Board of Immigration Appeals agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the INS lost again. Kiaraldeen's lawyers had gone to a
federal court to seek his release on a writ of habeas corpus. Judge
William H. Walls of New Jersey, granting the writ, said it was an
unconstitutional denial of due process of law to use secret
evidence against him _ to make him battle ``anonymous slurs of
unseen and unsworn informers.''
</P>
<P>
   Judges usually defer to government claims of a threat to
national security. Yet eight judges have rejected that claim in the
Kiaraldeen case: an immigration judge, six members of the Board of
Immigration Appeals and Walls. The FBI, which had been conducting a
criminal investigation of Kiaraldeen, closed that investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But the Immigration Service did not give up. It won legal stays
that at least temporarily prevented Kiaraldeen's release from
prison. It indicated that it would do anything it could to keep him
there while it sought to overturn the decisions in his favor.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   INS officials assured me that it was not just the momentum of
lawyers who do not like to lose; they really believed that
Kiaraldeen was a threat. But surely at some point they ought to
follow Oliver Cromwell's advice and consider the possibility that
they are mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Kiaraldeen case is not the only one to raise sharp
doubts about the use of secret evidence in immigration cases.
</P>
<P>
   Nasser Ahmed, another person of Arab origin (as almost all those
involved in these cases are), has been in INS detention for three
and a half years. An immigration judge first decided against him on
the basis of secret evidence. Then, when a habeas corpus petition
challenged his detention, the INS gave his lawyers a somewhat
fuller summary of the material, they put on a case, and the judge
changed his mind. The INS appealed, and Ahmed remains in prison.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, Judge Douglas Ginsburg of the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia compared an accused alien to
Joseph K. in ``The Trial.'' He had to prove that he was not a
terrorist without knowing the evidence against him, Ginsburg said:
``It is difficult to imagine how even someone innocent of all
wrongdoing could meet such a burden.''

U.S. AND CHINA CONCLUDE TALKS ON TRADE ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: This story was previously eliminated but has been restored.)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers finished two
days of meetings in China Monday with both sides extolling
financial cooperation and exuding friendship. But there was no sign
of progress on the overarching issue, China's entry into the World
Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Still, by all accounts, Summers' meetings Sunday with Prime
Minister Zhu Rongji and Monday with the finance minister, Xiang
Huaicheng, and other senior officials were friendly and free of
rancorous rhetoric _ perhaps an achievement in itself since the
countries are still emerging from the icy silence that followed
NATO's bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, last
May.
</P>
<P>
   Without discounting the difficult market-opening concessions the
United States demands of China before it will endorse membership in
the global trade body, Summers and other American officials
appeared optimistic that agreement was still possible in the coming
month, before new global negotiations begin.
</P>
<P>
   Summers and other senior economic and security officials came to
China for a meeting of the ``China-U.S. Joint Economic Committee,''
a periodically scheduled exchange of ideas. Officials said no trade
negotiations were held.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders on both sides clearly wanted to present a cheerful
public face and an exchange at Monday's news conference expressed
the mood.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the prospects for a trade agreement, Summers said:
``Any differences can be bridged with good will on both sides. But
certainly there are differences that have to be resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Xiang, smiling, replied: ``I agree with the point that with good
will, all the problems can be solved'' _ subtly suggesting,
perhaps, that a decision by the Americans to give China some slack
was now required.
</P>
<P>
   To which Summers quickly retorted, to laughs from the room of
officials and journalists, ``But there is something to be solved.''
</P>
<P>
   That ``something'' is, in the American view, concessions by
China to gradually allow global competitors to enter now-protected,
state-run sectors like financial services and telecommunications,
and to lower barriers to American farm products.
</P>
<P>
   Summers, in meetings and in a speech Monday at Qinghua
University extolling the merits of market forces and the free flow
of information and technology, argued that China will be better off
for letting in competition. This is accepted in principle by many
of China's leaders, but is difficult to carry out in a country with
serious problems of unemployment, farmer unrest and a huge, dying
state enterprise sector.
</P>
<P>
   In a visit to Washington last April, Rongji was said to have
made deep concessions that he hoped would clinch the trade deal,
but President Clinton decided they did not go far enough to satisfy
Congress, which will ultimately have to cooperate.

CREATION OF NO-FISHING ZONES PROPOSED TO CONSERVE FISH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Gulf States, New England)  (mk) 
 By CARL HULSE   
 NYT Regional Newspapers   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fearing that conventional fishing restrictions
cannot reverse a steep decline in marine stocks, conservationists
and fishery managers are increasingly advocating that large
expanses of the sea be put entirely off limits to harvesting of
ocean life.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of establishing such ``marine reserves'' has been
successfully employed by other nations and is gaining credence as a
step necessary to restore a variety of dwindling U.S. species that
have been overfished or lost as bycatch in the pursuit of more
valuable prey.
</P>
<P>
   The National Marine Fisheries Service is studying a plan that
would ban fishing in two 100-square-mile blocks of the Gulf of
Mexico off Florida to protect spawning grounds of the gag grouper.
Another proposal is emerging that would create extensive reserves
around the Dry Tortugas in habitat populated by a variety of reef
fish.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the Georges Bank and some scallop grounds off New
England are already closed to fishing and tight restrictions are in
place for the Oculina Bank off Fort Pierce, Fla. Consideration is
now being given to putting large stretches of the California coast
out of bounds and a Caribbean reserve is on the drawing board for
near St. Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates compare establishing huge no-fishing zones to the
practice of creating on-shore game preserves to protect wildlife
populations.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we don't hunt everywhere on land, we fish just about
everywhere in the ocean,'' said Chris Dorsett, fisheries program
director for the Gulf Restoration Network of New Orleans.
``Scientific evidence shows that protecting important areas can
help restore depleted fish populations _ meaning more fish in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   While aiding the species singled out for protection as well as
other fish, reserves have ancillary benefits in the eyes of
supporters: protecting sensitive habitat from destructive fishing
gear and creation of an environment relatively free of man.
</P>
<P>
   ``There ought to be parts of the ocean where we are minimizing
human activities to the extent that we can see what an unimpacted
marine ecosystem would look like,'' said Kim Davis, who monitors
Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico fisheries issues for the Center for
Marine Conservation.
</P>
<P>
   Fishing groups, while not g blanket opposition, are
skeptical of the value of marine reserves. Industry representatives
say the restrictions can have severe unintended consequences such
as causing stocks to drop elsewhere as fleets shift territory in
pursuit of their catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trendy right now, but we have been using time and
area closures for more than 10 years,'' said Justin LeBlanc, vice
president of government relations for the Washington-based National
Fisheries Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is new, and what concerns us a little bit, is when we
hear people saying they want to set aside 20 percent of the world's
oceans,'' he said. ``To unilaterally set aside big tracts of the
ocean without understanding the ramifications seems to be a
disconnect.''
</P>
<P>
   A scientist retained by the Southeastern Fisheries Association,
a group contesting the proposed Gulf gag grouper reserves, said the
new emphasis on marine reserves seems like a desperate search for a
``magic bullet'' solution to fish losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hard truth is, there are no magic bullets,'' wrote Trevor
Kenchington, a Canadian fisheries expert, in a review of the Gulf
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Others seem open to the idea, particularly since an array of
fishing restrictions does not appear to be working. Despite
individual bag limits, size limits, sharply defined seasons, caps
on the total annual catch of certain species, restrictions on the
type of gear used, even requirements for bycatch excluder devises,
fish populations continue to struggle and shrink.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditional methods of fish management are just not
effective,'' said Chris Smith, a spokesman for the Southeast Region
office of the National Marine Fisheries Service in St. Petersburg,
Fla.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That agency is reviewing the gag grouper proposal made by the
Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council, a multi-state commission
responsible for protecting Gulf fish stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The council was required to act after evidence showed that the
gag grouper, an important reef fish, was nearing a dangerous
population threshold. Two decades of heavy fishing in gag spawning
areas drastically cut the male population and reduced the size of
the spawning fish. Genetic tests showed heavy inbreeding.
</P>
<P>
   Council members originally designated more than 400 square miles
for the grouper reserve, but cut the area in half in July after
complaints by fishing interests. They also established the reserves
for just four years, saying they would be re-evaluated based on
demonstrated benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the panel are still unhappy and filed objections
with the federal fisheries service, complaining that the reserves
are not well thought out or based on sound science.
</P>
<P>
   Conservation groups were not satisfied, either, saying the size
of the no-fishing zones should not have been cut. But they consider
the grouper reserves a solid first step toward what they hope is
wider use of the concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marine reserves hold great potential for both the ecology and
the economy of the Gulf of Mexico,'' said Davis, the Center for
Marine Conservation expert.

IN LABOR'S BRITANNIA, LORDS BLOW THEIR OWN TRUMPETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Some peers wrote in Latin. Others wrote in verse.
Almost all hoped that their unique credentials _ whatever those
credentials might be _ would prove useful if they were allowed to
stay in the House of Lords.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a small and happy bison farmer with aspirations above
his station. ... '' Lord Seaford began in a written statement last
week describing why he wants to run in what is surely one of the
strangest British elections in memory.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the House of Lords is to begin deciding which 92
hereditary peers, whose titles are inherited, will be allowed to
remain in the chamber when the rest _ some 650 _ are forced to give
up their seats. Although he is running, along with more than 200
other lords, Seaford is no fan of the need to do so. ``Si fractum
non sit, noli id reficere,'' he declared in his statement _ the
Latin for, ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   In manifestoes that are by turns boastful, whimsical, modest,
supercilious and completely off the point, the candidates showed
widely varying approaches to the supremely unaristocratic chore of
begging for votes.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Rennell described himself as ``a sporting diplomat or a
diplomatic sport.'' The Earl of Clanwilliam mentioned an interest
in Chinese medicine. And Lord Geddes, a businessman, came up with a
crisp advertising-style slogan: ``Brains; Breadth; Brevity.''
</P>
<P>
   What has led to this unlikely spectacle is the Labor
government's program of constitutional overhaul. Under Prime
Minister Tony Blair, the government has enacted legislation
decreeing that Britons with inherited titles _ dukes, marquesses,
earls, countesses, viscounts, barons and the like, the overwhelming
majority of whom are Tories _ are no longer to be allowed to sit
and vote in Parliament's upper house. But in a concession to the
hereditaries, as they are known, the government is letting 92 stay
on, along with the 541 life peers, all appointees of one government
or another, whose titles die with them.
</P>
<P>
   All this has forced the peers to apply for jobs that they
inherited in the first place and that have never required anything.
Judging from their statements, it appears that this might be the
first time some of the lords have had to apply for anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always been interested in politics,'' wrote Lord
Harding of Petherton, while Lord Blyth proudly noted, ``I have
attended the House on a regular basis and have participated in all
the committees that I have been asked to sit on.''
</P>
<P>
   The peers were given just 75 words to explain themselves and
evoke hundreds of years of family history, so they had to say it
fast. (Lord Pender said it fastest: the word ``DUTY'' was his
entire statement). Some simply listed their achievements. The Earl
of Denbigh and Desmond noted that he is a member of the All Party
Motorcycling Group, while Lord Colwyn pointed to his experience as
chairman of the Refreshment Subcommittee, as well as his civilian
responsibilities as dental surgeon and bandleader.
</P>
<P>
   Several lords seemed almost genetically unable to engage in
self-promotion, something that Britons from old families have
traditionally found most unattractive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hardly for me to attempt to proselytize my candidature;
it is a matter for my peers,'' said Lord Morris. The Earl of Onslow
did him one better, getting the word ``vainglorious'' into his
non-manifesto manifesto: ``It would be as vainglorious to proclaim
a personal manifesto as it would be arrogant to list any
achievement,'' he wrote. ``I therefore hope that my fellow peers
will honor me with their vote, on account of their knowledge of my
endeavors.''
</P>
<P>
   When the landed aristocracy really did run Britain and there was
a sense that coming from an impressively titled family meant you
had a duty to your country and a certain degree of innate
intelligence, the House of Lords had a crucial legislative role to
play. In recent years, though, it has been stripped of most of its
power and serves mostly as a tempering influence on the House of
Commons.
</P>
<P>
   Some candidates spoke wistfully of the Lords' tradition of
independence, especially now that the government enjoys such a huge
majority in the House of Commons and dissenting voices are so rare.
</P>
<P>
   When the bulk of the hereditaries hang up their ermine robes for
good, Britain will lose one of its strongest surviving links to the
distant past. Some hereditary peers have titles that date back 600
years, before Parliament even existed, and many have ancestors that
figure prominently in the nation's history. Among the current Lords
are Earl Sandwich, of the sandwich family, and the Marquess of
Queensbury, of the boxing-rules family.
</P>
<P>
   And what legislative body other than the Lords would include a
member who wants to keep her seat on the ground that she ``writes
Lords diary; brings flowers; loves House of Lords,'' as Baroness
Strange does? Or a member whose manifesto supports ``action against
cruelty to animals, especially fishing with rods,'' as Viscount
Monckton of Brenchley's does?
</P>
<P>
   That's not all. If elected, the Viscount wrote, he will do his
best to further his strongly held belief that all cats should be
``muzzled outside to stop the agonizing torture of mice and small
birds.''

 &HT;    Braves facing calamity, but remain calm
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ All season, the Braves have had a hard time
explaining how they have won. So maybe that's why they seem calm in
the face of their biggest World Series calamity of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   They're just going to do it, not try to figure it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we need to win, period,'' Greg Maddux said. ``We're
not in a good position. We need to come out and play a good game,
do the things we're supposed to do, not beat ourselves, play the
game right.''
</P>
<P>
   Down 2-0 to the Yankees, the Braves need a win tonight from Tom
Glavine over Andy Pettitte to keep breathing. A loss and the end of
the season and the decade-long postseason run is all but a
technicality. No team has ever come back to win a best-of-seven
series after trailing 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves came back, down 3-1, to win the 1996 NLCS. And this
year, they saw the Mets come about as close as a team could to
erasing a 3-0 deficit before chasing them off in the unforgettable
Game 6 of the NLCS.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves haven't won since.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have been teased in a 4-1 loss in Game 1 after
leading Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez 1-0 in the eighth inning.
Then, they were humiliated 7-2 Sunday night, when a lineup shuffle
backfired for the most-lopsided loss in their 27 World Series games
of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' top two pitchers have been beaten, and their lineup
has been brought to its offensive knees. They have looked as bad as
they can look, but they're still looking ahead.
</P>
<P>
   For that, they owe the Yankees, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were dealing with the exact same situation in 1996.
New York had lost the first two games to the Braves in Yankee
Stadium by a combined 16-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have only to look as far as the other dugout to see how
it's done,'' Chipper Jones said. ``Why not? It's not impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves defied logic for 103 regular-season wins and an
eighth division title of the '90s. They scored more runs than any
other Braves team _ 840 _ without their best power hitter, Andres
Galarraga. They won more games in their last at-bat (31) than any
team in the majors without their best clutch hitter, Javy Lopez,
for the season's second half.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves led the majors in ERA _ 3.63 _ with their fourth-best
starter Kevin Millwood emerging as the ace and with a volatile
former setup man, John Rocker, as the steadying force in the
bullpen, replacing Kerry Ligtenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they've got to win at least two of three games at Yankee
Stadium to keep this Series alive, against a team that has reduced
the Braves offense to a free-swinging mess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we tried too hard,'' said Ryan Klesko, who is
0 for 7 in the first two games of this World Series. ``We just need
to relax. We swung the bats good against Randy Johnson (this
season), the best left-hander in the game. We don't care how good
you are, our offense shouldn't be that bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves are as cold as they've ever been in a World Series,
hitting only 7 for 58 (.121) in the first two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``(In) my first two at-bats in the first two games I was going
to go to extreme pain to break up a no-hitter,'' Chipper Jones
said. ``Someone asked me about a lack of runs. Who's talking about
runs? We're just trying to get some hits. It's frustrating. This is
a team that's accustomed to scoring runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be shut down the way we have the last two games is a dent
to everyone's ego,'' Jones said, ``but we've just got to relax and
go out and have fun and not worry about the outcome of the game and
compete and hope things turn around.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves can take solace in these numbers: They have lost
their last seven games against the Yankees in Atlanta, dating back
to three losses at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium in the 1996 World
Series. But they have won 7 of their last 11 games at Yankee
Stadium in that time, including two of three in interleague play in
July.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows what we're here to do,'' Ryan Klesko said.
``We're not going to hang our heads. We're going to go out, play
hard; if we get beat, we get beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux said, ``We're still hungry to win. We're not going to lay
down. We've got some quality players over here who at any second
could start playing a lot better.''

ORGANIZERS SATISFIED   AFTER SMOOTH WEEKEND OF RACING 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ The 40-mile-per-hour gusts that might have
blown everybody halfway to Harvard Yard never happened. Nobody ran
a shell up onto Memorial Drive. Except for the usual fender-benders
and tangled oars between Dead Man's Turn and the Eliot Street
Bridge, there were no pileups. And the right people got the medals.
</P>
<P>
   The 35th Head of the Charles Regatta _ with its 6,500 rowers
from 300 clubs in two dozen countries in 1,400 boats competing in
40 races over two sun-dappled days _ came off with barely a ripple.
</P>
<P>
   Monday morning, as the tents were being taken down along the
river and the last boat trailers left for North Carolina and
Colorado and points between, executive director Fred Schoch finally
exhaled _ and began thinking about next year.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, the 75-member race committee will have its usual
debriefing dinner. Next month, the management team will convene.
``That's when we think about how to tweak the regatta,'' Schoch
said.
</P>
<P>
   No tweaking was necessary in 1965 when the founders had to
recruit entrants by phone. But now that the Head has grown into the
largest two-day rowing event on the planet, the annual questions
have taken on more urgency.
</P>
<P>
   Can the regatta get any bigger? (No, Schoch says.) Are
performance standards necessary? (Probably.) Should the organizers
keep bringing in the international elite? (Yes.) Is the event too
commercial? (Not yet.) Not commercial enough? (God forbid.)
</P>
<P>
   Those are all the same issues that the Boston Athletic
Association grappled with in the '80s after the road running boom
turned its annual marathon into a monster. ``These are the growing
pains of the regatta,'' Schoch conceded. ``We really can't be all
things to all people.''
</P>
<P>
   The charm of the Head is that it has managed to be exactly that.
It offers medals for men and women in 20 events across nine
categories _ youth, club, master, senior master, grand master,
veteran, senior veteran, lightweight, and championship (elite). It
has no qualifying requirements. Anyone who finishes within 5
percent of the winning time is guaranteed an entry for the
following year. The rest are awarded by lottery.
</P>
<P>
   So anyone who ever has dipped an oar into water is eligible to
share the course with an Olympic gold medalist. As Title IX and
America's fascination with lifetime fitness sports have made rowing
a hot sport, the Head's entry lists have exploded from 3,900 in
1990 to 5,600 last year to 6,500 now. As it was, one-third of the
10,000 applicants were shut out.
</P>
<P>
   The event can't get any bigger, regatta officials say. The Head
is not a road race. ``In the marathon, you can stick as many
runners on the course as you want,'' Schoch said. ``Our problem is,
our start is single file. Can you imagine what the marathon would
be like if they started one at a time every 10 seconds? They'd be
running for a week.''
</P>
<P>
   So the pressing issue is who gets to row. The scramble for slots
is so competitive that numerous clubs and colleges have dreamed up
imaginary spinoffs to get more entries. ``That's why you see all
these funny names,'' said Schoch. ``We have to find a sane and fair
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as the BAA finally went to qualifying standards for the
marathon, the Head is leading that way, too. ``I wouldn't be
surprised to see a portion of the entries based on performance in
other regattas,'' Schoch said.
</P>
<P>
   But not all of them. ``We want the race to still be a place
where the novice can row on the same river as an Olympian.''
</P>
<P>
   The Head always has been as much about the St. Ursula Academy
women's four from Ohio as the US men's eight, as much about the
Rude &AMP; Smooth BC as the Deutscher Ruderverband. That's essentially
what next month's tweaking session will be about. How can the Head
of the Charles keep finding space for both of them?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we should go to a LeMans start,'' Schoch mused
puckishly. ``That would be a crowd-thriller. Put everybody at the
Mass. Ave. bridge _ and let 'em go.''
</P>

<P>
   BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan _ The deserts, steppes and mountains of
Central Asia have given birth to some of history's most brutal
conquerors, but very few democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Kyrgyzstan, however, there are intriguing hints that the
idea of popular sovereignty may be taking hold. If it does, this
remote and landlocked nation could become the first democracy in
Central Asia's long history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason is our heritage as nomads,'' said Askar Sarygulov,
a former government official. ``The Kyrgyz have always lived in
small groups, not under emperors. We're used to thinking for
ourselves. So maybe the ground here is a little more fertile for
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Kyrgyzstan can keep its democratic promise may soon
become clear. Parliamentary and presidential elections are
scheduled for next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are making every effort to assure that these elections will
be fair and transparent,'' President Askar Akayev said in an
interview. ``This is our test, our examination, and we want to do
very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Akayev, a physicist and mathematician, has refused to say
whether he will run for re-election, but stepping down voluntarily
would be an astonishing gesture. Since time immemorial, leaders in
this part of the world have held power until they died or were
forced out.
</P>
<P>
   Holding a free election would also be a radical break with
tradition. Opposition figures say that the police have already
begun harassing them and preventing them from holding rallies.
Akayev blamed overzealous local officials for such abuses and said
he would not tolerate them.
</P>
<P>
   People in Kyrgyzstan, a nation of 4.5 million that was part of
the Soviet Union until 1991, seem to admire Akayev's dedication to
democratic principles. But many consider him too weak for his job.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In eight years as president, Akayev has not been able to return
his people to the living standard they had during Soviet days. Some
of his close relatives and leading supporters have garishly
enriched themselves at public expense. And in the south, Islamic
guerrillas have begun a campaign that could threaten national and
regional stability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our president is a great philosopher,'' said Bahrom
Attohojayev, a barber in the southern town of Osh. ``Maybe he would
make a good leader of a country that has no problems. But we have
problems. We need a tough guy who can get things done.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   If the opposition managed to unite behind a strong candidate,
Akayev could lose at the polls next year. Such a democratic turn of
events would be unthinkable in any of the other four Central Asian
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Neighboring Tajikistan has recently emerged from civil war and
is in ruins. The electoral commission there has disqualified every
opposition candidate who sought to run for president in an election
in November.
</P>
<P>
   Turkmenistan is run by a former Communist who has made himself
the center of a personality cult. The leaders of Kazakhstan and
Uzbekistan are both autocrats who brook no opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In this company, Akayev stands out as a veritable Jeffersonian.
His government has harassed opposition newspapers and political
parties but still allows them to function. Politicians and other
public figures denounce him without fearing for their safety.
</P>
<P>
   Even most of Akayev's critics concede that he is highly
intelligent. But they also say he is easily influenced, unable to
curb rampant corruption, and ill equipped for the challenges of
ruling a turbulent Central Asian nation, particularly one
threatened by social problems and now a religion-based insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A prominent newspaper editor, Zamira Sydykova, recently spent 10
weeks in jail after being found guilty of slandering Akayev. But
soon after her release Akayev invited her to a joint television
appearance and they publicly made peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It showed his two sides,'' Ms. Sydykova said. ``As a person or
a scientist, he believes in freedom, and that's good for
Kyrgyzstan. But in his identity as president, he isn't doing enough
to fight those who want to kill freedom, including people in his
own group.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   During the interview, at a rural government guest house that
dates to Soviet days, Akayev, 54, wore a business suit and a white
kolpak, the high-peaked felt hat that is traditional for Kyrgyz
men. He said he looked forward to the day when Kyrgyzstan would be
considered ``the Switzerland of Central Asia,'' comparable not only
in Alpine splendor but also in social justice, democracy, ethnic
peace and a thriving economy based on tourism and financial
services.
</P>
<P>
   Many Kyrgyz joke about that vision. They say that although their
country can boast magnificent scenery, it lacks the essential item
necessary to become another Switzerland: Swiss people.

 &HT;    Braves fever a thing of past?
 &HT;    By Matt Kempner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gotta light? The fire is missing from fans witnessing
yet another Braves swing at a championship.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Braves began flailing around in the World Series
this year, fans say recent postseasons seem to have lacked the heat
of the past.
</P>
<P>
   We're not just talking about ticket sales, although Atlanta has
been chided for failing to sell out most of its playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   The real change, fans say, is a shortage of Braves fever.
</P>
<P>
   Where have all the tomahawks gone? Where are the fan rallies?
What happened to the face paintings by the bucketful?
</P>
<P>
   _ WXIA (the Atlanta NBC affiliate) president Bob Walker says
preliminary numbers for the first two World Series games captured a
``very strong'' 714,000 households or 42 percent of area homes with
TVs. That's down, however, from about 50 percent of households that
tuned in when the Braves played the Yankees in the first game of
the 1996 World Series, according to The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``It's about dead,'' says Beverly James, who sells $1 bags of
peanuts _ $2 during the World Series _ from a corner stand near
Turner Field. She still sells plenty of peanuts, but she and other
vendors say T-shirt and other merchandise sales are slow and and
fans aren't as rowdy.
</P>
<P>
   _ MARTA bus driver Archie Rayford, who transports fans to Turner
Field, says that fans have been ``laid back.'' Only once in a while
have they worked up to a little polite cheering. And he hasn't seen
anybody _ kids or adults _ with tomahawks painted on their cheeks.
In the past, he said, ``It was unbelievable: Cheering,
tomahawk-chopping. It seemed like everybody had a tomahawk.''
</P>
<P>
   Butch Miller of Flowery Branch, Ga., seemed plenty stoked for a
World Series game over the weekend. He shepherded in his 9-year-old
son, Carey, and two friends, all garbed in appropriate Braves fan
attire. A friend offered to buy their tickets for $500 each, but
Miller and the kids decided it was more important to be at the game
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Miller, a car dealer, understands the drop-off in
excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``You remember Christmas when you were 5 years old? Were you
excited? Yeah. You remember Christmas when you were 25? Were you
still excited? No, but you still liked it.''
</P>
<P>
   Says John Bevilaqua a sports-marketing consultant, ``The newness
has worn off.'' And besides, says Bevilaqua, metro Atlantans have
busy schedules and plenty of other pro and, particularly, college
teams to share their loyalties with.
</P>
<P>
   Bevilaqua also says the personalities on the Braves team don't
add a lot of extra excitement to the game, despite their obvious
skill.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team doesn't play with a lot of passion,'' he said. Other
than pitcher John Rocker, he said, ``There are no real rah-rah guys
on the field,'' and that has an impact on the emotion level of
fans.
</P>
<P>
   How does a city that pegs itself as the sports capital of the
world respond to suggestions that over-the-top fan support is
fading?
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen it,'' says Gary Stokan, president of the
Atlanta Sports Council, an arm of the Metro Atlanta Chamber of
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Stokan says the Braves have averaged more than 3 million tickets
sold annually since 1991, while the New York Yankees only managed
to go over the 3 million mark for the first time this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now tabulate that for fan apathy,'' he said. ``There is no fan
apathy in Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the contention that metro Atlanta is the sports capital
of the world: It is based on sports facilities and big-name events
held here. And Stokan says that what attracts the event organizers
who select sites are good transportation access, top facilities,
hotel accommodations, support volunteers and corporate backers.
</P>
<P>
   Fan fever doesn't make the priority list.

SAMPLE HAWAIIAN TASTES OF MAUI BEACH CAFE 
</HEADLINE>

 &HT;    By NATALIE HAUGHTON

<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   WESTWOOD, Calif. _ If you dream of gentle breezes, blue ocean
waters, tropical flowers and trees, sunshine and Hawaiian regional
cuisine, a dining trip to the islands is at hand at Maui Beach
Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   There you can indulge in the aloha-spirited cuisine of executive
chef Mako Segawa-Gonzales, a Hawaiian native, who designed the
menu. ``Our food is based on Hawaiian regional cuisine,'' he said.
``We have adapted the foods and cultures of Hawaii to the tastes of
the mainland.''
</P>
<P>
   The glitzy and colorful but casual restaurant hopes to fill the
void on the mainland for those who have a passion for a type of
island-style fare, using Hawaiian products, that was developed more
than two decades ago by a group of Hawaiian chefs, noted owner Jeff
Knight.
</P>
<P>
   The dishes at the cafe feature a blend of many cultures besides
Hawaiian: Japanese, Chinese, Thai, Korean, Portuguese and mainland
American. Segawa-Gonzales' food philosophy and goal emphasize
utilizing the freshest ingredients possible to make good food that
people will enjoy eating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quality ingredients and a preparation style that accents
quality and represents the Hawaiian Islands is what is important to
me. It's my heritage. When making a dish, I look at the freshness
of the ingredients, the flavor, the aromas, how I can present it
and how it will be perceived,'' he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Segawa-Gonzales strives to use island products _ fresh fish,
produce and spices _ in his cooking where possible. He features
some Hawaiian fish such as opah (moon fish), ahi tuna, mahi mahi (a
flaky, delicate white fish) and ono (a firm white fish) when
feasible. Some of his creations also star mangoes, maui onions,
macadamia nuts, guavas, lilikoi (passion fruit) and coconut.
</P>
<P>
   The menu selections, served from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., range from
Asian tapas to noodles to entrees, bowls, salads, sides and
desserts. You can dine light, share dishes with friends or opt for
an entire meal. To get you in the tropical mood, nine smoothies are
available from the bar with names like Haleakala Sunrise, Blue
Hawaiian, Sweet Leilani, Surf's Up and Tropical Delight.
</P>
<P>
   Maui Beach also offers three to six daily specials, including
different lunch combos, one or two fish specials, a meat special
and sometimes an appetizer special. But diners continue to order
and enjoy the three top-selling menu items _ Maui Roll (baked
salmon, avocado, cucumber and green onions), Ginger Seared Ahi Tuna
and the Dark Chocolate Lava Cake (served with vanilla bean ice
cream). Once you've tasted them, it's easy to understand why.
</P>
<P>
   We sampled a variety of delicious and inspired menu items on a
few different visits to the restaurant and have come up with
copycat versions you can re-create in your own kitchen. Although
it's not usually our style to request recipes from chefs, we did
enlist a little help from Segawa-Gonzales in the ingredient and
recipe departments. In some cases, the amounts in the shared
recipes were too large and unwieldy and had to be reworked and
streamlined for home kitchens. In others, we took the liberty of
streamlining the cooking steps and ingredients as much as possible
for the convenience and ease of home cooks. The seven replica
recipes that follow came out very similar to those at the cafe.
</P>
<P>
   The Hana Bay Chopped Salad is a delightful mixture of finely
chopped lettuces, corn kernels, chopped tomatoes, chopped green
onions and avocado. But a Mango Balsamic Dressing _ with its sweet
and tart flavors _ is what makes the salad unique. Although the
restaurant dressing includes a hint of vanilla (from a vanilla
bean) and coconut (from coconut liquid), which we couldn't detect,
we opted to not include them in our recipe, with no adverse
results. Serve the salad for a lunch or dinner entree or side dish,
adjusting the portions accordingly. Garnishing as the restaurant
does with crispy cooked rice noodles adds good looks and a nice
finishing touch, but isn't required. Frying the noodles is a
hassle, one extra step that takes extra time _ so we made it
optional.
</P>
<P>
   If a smoothie strikes your fancy, whip up the Haleakala Sunrise
in a jiffy in the blender with apple juice, frozen strawberries, a
banana, nonfat plain yogurt and a little ice. It's thick, simple
and soothing _ and a great way to start the morning or give
yourself a little pick up during the day.
</P>
<P>
   Grilled Japanese Eggplant and Goat Cheese Salad is another
wonderful possibility for salad devotees. We found a grill pan a
boon in grilling the thin Japanese eggplant slices on top of the
stove _ and in no time flat. To keep the eggplant from sticking,
use olive oil spray in the bottom of the pan. Also spray the slices
before turning to cook the second side. To ensure soft, tender,
edible eggplant, cover the pan while cooking over high heat until
you have beautiful brown grill marks on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The Roasted Garlic Vinaigrette that goes with the salad is a
dynamite dressing _ and includes plenty of roasted garlic cloves.
We used purchased peeled garlic cloves in a jar from the
refrigerated produce section, as the restaurant does. But to save
time and energy, we cheated a bit and roasted them in a microwave
oven instead of a conventional oven. It's a neat little trick _ it
took only two minutes for a half-cup of cloves drizzled with a
little olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   The salad goes together with assorted baby greens, crumbled goat
cheese, chopped tomatoes, eggplant slices and a drizzle of the
garlic vinaigrette. If you want a more substantial main-dish salad,
simply add some grilled chicken breast slices.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicken Lettuce Wraps, a copy of a typically Chinese dish,
makes a great starter or snack. Diners are served separate plates
of a chicken mixture _ fragrant with ginger, garlic, sesame oil,
onions, mushrooms, teriyaki and oyster sauces _ and iceberg
lettuce-leaf cups. Spoon the chicken and sauce into the cups, roll
up and eat. Yummy and fun!
</P>
<P>
   Brie Pizza was a menu special one evening _ and diners liked it
so much we zapped out a copycat version. Instead of making pizza
crust, we used a 12-inch thin-crust Boboli. The creation goes
together almost instantly with purchased shredded mozzarella
cheese, chopped fresh basil, roasted garlic cloves (roast for a few
seconds in the microwave) and cut-up pieces of brie cheese. A
seven- to eight-minute bake in a very hot oven, and the pizza is
done. Fresh greens tossed with apples and mandarin oranges and a
vinaigrette dressing round out the meal.
</P>
<P>
   A little more complicated to prepare but definitely worthwhile
is the Crispy Salmon Rice Bowl. Cooked rice is topped with
stir-fried vegetables, sauced with soy sauce, lemon and lime juices
and mirin (rice wine), and sauteed salmon fillets. If time is
short, pick up a package of cleaned, stir-fried fresh veggies in
the produce section. The mixture from our market contained snow
peas, carrots, broccoli, cabbage and more.
</P>
<P>
   The Dark Chocolate Lava Cake, designed to appeal to chocolate
lovers, is fabulous _ and whenever we dine at the restaurant, it's
a must-order dessert. (It takes 20 minutes to make, so request it
before you finish dinner.) Once you cut into the individual-size
serving, a stream of dark chocolate (lava) spills out from the
center onto the plate. Served with vanilla bean ice cream, it's
divine. The version here is surprisingly easy to make in individual
souffle dishes. The chocolate-butter mixture melts in a jiffy in
the microwave oven, and then you simply whisk in two kinds of
sugars, cornstarch, whole eggs and egg yolks until smooth. All who
taste this creation rave about it.
</P>
<P>
   Any or all of these dishes will add pizazz to your repertoire.
And when you don't feel like cooking, head to Maui Beach Cafe for a
taste of paradise. &QL;

 &HT;    Old meets new: Flames, Thrashers create new ice age
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The city's great Flame-out is nearly 20 years old. But
the only NHL player to call Atlanta home for all eight seasons is
having difficulty feeling nostalgic about this evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice that they're back, but to be honest I just feel like
it's too late,'' former Atlanta/Calgary Flames goalie Daniel
Bouchard said.
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard will be among those in attendance tonight when the old
Atlanta franchise returns to face the new one at Philips Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should've never left here,'' he said. ``Atlanta was one
of the best hockey towns in the league. Everybody wanted to play
here and loved the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were playing in a nice arena,'' Bouchard said, ``and when
we moved to Calgary, we were playing in a much smaller building,
the Corral, because the new rink wasn't ready yet. I didn't feel
like we were in the NHL anymore. It felt like it was a step down
instead of a step up. That was the sad part.''
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard never embraced Alberta, but he didn't have a lot of
time. He played only 14 games for the Flames in their first season
in Calgary in 1980-81 before being shuttled to Quebec. He wasn't
there when the Flames reached the Stanley Cup finals in 1986 or won
it in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   But Bouchard, who coaches the hockey program at Life College,
will be among the former Flames who will be recognized by the
Thrashers after the first period of tonight's game. At least six
players still living in Atlanta will be included in on-ice
ceremonies: Bouchard, Tom Lysiak, Eric Vail, Willi Plett, Tim
Ecclestone and Randy Manery.
</P>
<P>
   Former coach Bernie ``Boom Boom'' Geoffrion, who dropped the
ceremonial first puck at the regular-season opener against New
Jersey, might not attend, because of health reasons. Former owner
Tom Cousins is expected to be in attendance but not be introduced.
It was Cousins who, in need of cash in a sagging real-estate
market, sold the Flames in 1980 to Canadian Nelson Skalbania.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard through the year that the situation wasn't great
financially,'' said Calgary assistant coach Al MacNeil, the Flames'
head coach in their final season here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Mr. Cousins was making efforts to get some corporate
support,'' MacNeil said. ``But I remember late in the season when
Coca-Cola, which was one of the companies Mr. Cousins was talking
to, gave Emory University a hundred million dollars. When I saw
(that) the money went that way, I thought, `We're history.' It
didn't take a rocket scientist to figure it out.''
</P>
<P>
   MacNeil is one of the few remaining ``active'' links between the
Flames and Atlanta. Others who will be present tonight are
Thrashers equipment manager Bobby Stewart, who spent 26 years with
Atlanta/Calgary, and the Thrashers' director of team services
Michele Zarzaca, who worked in the Flames' marketing department.
</P>
<P>
   The game isn't the Flames' first return to Atlanta since the
move. In 1990, the team played two exhibition games against Boston
at the Omni. MacNeil said, ``I don't know if I'll have any real
strong feelings in the game because we'll be in a different
building.''
</P>
<P>
   Vail agreed that the earlier return ``was more emotional,'' but
he said is looking forward to tonight. He is among several former
Flames still living in Atlanta whom the Thrashers have used in
marketing ventures. As compensation, the team supplied four season
tickets this year for the ex-players to share.
</P>
<P>
   Vail, who scored an Atlanta franchise-high 174 goals, said he
enjoyed his short time in Calgary _ he was traded to Detroit after
little more than one season there _ but has vivid memories of the
final season in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a couple of months to go in the season, the rumors were
flying,'' he said. ``I remember when we were playing the Rangers in
the playoffs and between periods of one of the games, (a team
official) said, `You guys are one step away from going to Calgary.'
He said it trying to motivate us. My guess is it wouldn't have made
a difference. We were gone even if we had won the Stanley Cup.''

J.M. COETZEE'S, `DISGRACE' WINS BOOKER PRIZE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ ``Disgrace,'' J.M. Coetzee's powerful novel about life
in post-apartheid South Africa, won the Booker Prize, Britain's
most important literary award, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Coetzee (pronounced cught-SEE-uh) is the first person in the
31-year history of the Booker, which is worth about $35,000, to win
it for a second time. The first time was in 1983, for ``The Life
and Times of Michael K.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a quiet year for a prize typically characterized by
vigorous arguing, sniping and second-guessing, both among the
five-member panel of judges and from members of London's
gossip-loving literary world. The list of six finalists was most
remarked on not for those who made it, but for those who were left
out _ which included Salman Rushdie's ``Ground Beneath Her Feet''
and Vikram Seth's ``An Equal Music.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Disgrace'' tells the story of a 52-year-old college professor
_ Coetzee himself is professor of general literature at the
University of Cape Town _ who is accused of sexual harassment after
an affair with a student and seeks refuge on his daughter's farm.
</P>
<P>
   When she is the victim of a brutal attack, their disagreements
about what course of action to take force an examination of their
place in South Africa's changing world.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Kaufman, a member of Parliament and the chairman of the
judges' panel, said the novel was ``an allegory about what is
happening to the human race in the post-colonial era.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense this is a millennial book,'' he added, ``because it
takes us through the 20th century into a new century in which the
source of power is shifting away from Western Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   The six-book short list included Anita Desai's ``Fasting,
Feasting,'' which examines the vast differences between life in
India and in the United States through the story of one Indian
family and which Kaufman said was the judges' second choice for the
prize.
</P>
<P>
   Another book nominated was Michael Frayn's ``Headlong,'' the
story of an academic's efforts to prove that a picture he spots in
a neighbor's house is a long-lost Bruegel.
</P>
<P>
   The list also included Ahdaf Soueif's ``Map of Love,'' about two
parallel love affairs between Westerners and Egyptians, one at the
turn of the century and one in the present.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Fathers,'' the first novel by the Scottish writer Andrew
O'Hagan, in which a grandson called to his grandfather's death bed
in Glasgow reviews both their lives, was another of the nominees.
</P>
<P>
   The sixth was ``The Blackwater Lightship,'' by Colm Toibin, in
which a young woman grapples with her uneasy relationship with her
mother and grandmother as her beloved brother dies of AIDS.

<P>
   Major oil companies said Monday that third-quarter earnings rose
substantially, with some more than doubling, largely because of the
increased price of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of all the companies, which had risen in recent months in
expectations of the earnings reports, declined Monday, some by
significant amounts, as investors took profits.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Atlantic Richfield Co., which showed a seven-fold rise
in earnings, saw its stock fall.
</P>
<P>
   ARCO fell $3.125, to close at $90.875. Exxon declined by
$2.8125, to close at $74.625. Chevron fell $3.75 to close at $90.
Texaco Inc. fell the least, by 87.5 cents to close at $62. All are
traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was a lot of buying on the expectations and
selling on the news,'' said Tyler Dann, an oil analyst for Banc of
America Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Wilson, an oil analyst for JP Morgan Securities, said there
was a lot of profit-taking after many of the stocks had risen by
large amounts. He said, ``People were thinking, `I made a lot of
money in this round. I think I'll take some off the table and lock
in some profits.'''
</P>
<P>
   Exxon's overall earnings totaled $1.5 billion, or 61 cents a
share, for the third quarter, up 7 percent compared to earnings of
$1.4 billion, or 58 cents a share, in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Its profits from exploration and production totaled $1 billion
for the third quarter, more than double the earnings of $485
million in the same quarter the year before.
</P>
<P>
   But in refining, profits were only $137 million in the quarter,
down sharply from the $581 million in the third quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
   Lee R. Raymond, the chairman of Exxon, said that as crude oil
prices rose, the company could not raise prices on its refined
products fast enough to recover higher costs.
</P>
<P>
   Sales rose to $33.1 billion in the third quarter, up 16 percent
from sales of $28.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Mobil Corp., which Exxon is in the process of acquiring, saw
its earnings rise to $705 million, or 87 cents a share, up 42
percent from earnings of $497 million, or 61 cents a share, from
the third quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sales rose 20 percent to $16.4 billion from $13.6 billion the
year before.
</P>
<P>
   Texaco said Monday that its earnings more than doubled to $453
million, or 83 cents a share, up from $208 million, or 37 cents a
share, the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Sales were up 26 percent, rising to $9.68 billion from $7.7
billion the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Peter I. Bijur, the chairman and chief executive of Texaco, said
cutbacks by a coalition of oil producers and strong global
economies which kept up demand were the major reasons for higher
profits.
</P>
<P>
   He warned, however, that ``as we've seen in recent weeks prices
remain volatile.'' The price of crude oil fell from $24 last month
to the $22 range, although they have recently rebounded. The drop
was caused by speculation that the oil cartel may increase
production, although its leaders have said that they had no plans
to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron also reported a sharp rise of 82 percent in its
earnings. Profits in the third quarter totaled $702 million, or
$1.07 a share, up from $386 million, or 59 cents a share, in the
third quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sales rose by 33 percent to $10.2 billion from $7.68 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Derr, the chairman and chief executive of Chevron said,
however, that the sharp rise in crude prices ``squeezed margins in
our refining.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that profits from refining totalled $97 million or about
half of the $188 million earned in the third quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
   Derr said that continued cost-cutting had also helped profits.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company would raise the number of people it will cut
by the middle of next year by 400, to 3,100.
</P>
<P>
   The sharpest rise in earnings came from Atlantic Richfield,
which reported that third-quarter earnings increased sevenfold.
</P>
<P>
   Profits for the third quarter totalled $511 million, or $1.55 a
share, compared to $73 million, or 22 cents a share, in the third
quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sales rose by 26 percent to $3.54 billion from $2.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ARCO has been acquired by BP Amoco PLC.
</P>
<P>
   Some executives gave credit for the sharp rise in the price of
crude oil to a coalition of oil producing nations that includes
Mexico, Norway and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, which cut back production last March by about 5 million
barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts, combined with a recovery in the Asian economies, more
than doubled the price of crude oil since early last year.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter the price of crude oil averaged $21.71 a
barrel compared with $14.15 a year before in trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. Some analysts have predicted that the
price of crude oil could rise to close to $30 a barrel in the
fourth quarter.

CLINTON SIGNS ONE SPENDING BILL BUT VETOES ANOTHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton signed into law a $268-billion
spending bill for the Pentagon on Monday, avoiding the risk of a
crippling split among Democrats at the very moment that the parties
are hurtling toward the finale of their budget showdown. At the
same time, he vetoed a separate spending bill, assailing
Republicans for making ``wrong choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's remarks about the Pentagon bill were decidedly mixed.
He criticized it for budgetary gimmicks and pork barrel projects.
But he said he had concluded that it contained crucial elements,
such as a pay raise for the military, adding: ``I cannot allow our
national security needs to be held hostage to this budget battle.''
</P>
<P>
   With the budget fight entering a critical week, Clinton struck a
particularly combative tone over plans by the Republican leaders of
Congress to include an across-the-board spending cut of up to 1.4
percent in the year's final spending bill. The move is a last
effort by Republicans to put in place a budget that does not touch
Social Security reserves.
</P>
<P>
   The president charged that the across-the-board cut would lead
to layoffs in the military, and harm education and environmental
programs. ``I will not allow Congress to raise its own pay and fund
its pork barrel projects and still make devastating cuts in
everything from education to child nutrition to the FBI,'' he said
in announcing that he had signed the Pentagon bill but vetoed a
measure funding the Commerce, State, and Justice Departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not sign any budget that puts special interests above
the national interest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, by signing the Pentagon measure, Clinton shied away from
escalating the confrontation over the budget and instead narrowed
the fight to a manageable set of issues: the shape of education
programs, police hiring, the environment and foreign aid. His
balancing act set the framework for the endgame of the year's
budget struggle, a fight whose outcome both parties believe is
likely to significantly influence the course of the congressional
elections in 2000, particularly in the narrowly divided House.
</P>
<P>
   The final showdown could come as early as this week, because
legislation expires on Friday that has temporarily kept the
government running through the first weeks of the 2000 federal
fiscal year that began Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders praised Clinton and tried to set him
apart from the House Democrats led by Rep. Dick Gephardt, whom they
accused of fomenting partisan confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has rejected the gridlock strategy of Dick
Gephardt,''' said Rep. Tom DeLay, the House majority whip from
Texas. Rep. Dick Armey, the House majority leader who is also from
Texas, said he thought the president's action would make it ''that
much easier'' to negotiate a compromise on the budget.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the president's decision to sign the Pentagon bill gave
the Republicans something they had wanted: a fight over a limited
number of bills which scaled back the possibility that Clinton can
score big wins in negotiations over an omnibus spending package as
has happened in his past confrontations with the Republicans. It
takes 13 annual spending bills to put the budget in place. The
president and Republicans are now struggling over five of the
bills.
</P>
<P>
   For the White House, the decision to sign the Pentagon bill was
a balancing act. Some Democrats believe that the longer a budget
stalemate goes on the better it is for them politically, bringing
back memories of the government shutdown of 1995 that proved
devastating to the Republicans. But the Pentagon measure was
popular and had originally passed the House by the overwhelming
vote of 372-55.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt had pledged to fight vigorously to deliver the 146
Democratic votes needed to sustain a veto. But other senior
Democrats had expressed reservations about a veto that could make
them vulnerable to attack on national security and were threatening
to vote with the Republicans against a veto.
</P>
<P>
   Several White House aides and Democrats familiar with White
House budget strategy said Clinton had decided he did not want the
Republicans to divert the budget fight to national security but
instead wanted to keep the struggle on grounds which Democrats are
more comfortable with, such as education, police and the
environment.

IN UNION, SOMETHING OLD AND SOMETHING NEW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the end, the Boston banker put his wing-tipped foot down in
the name of history and heritage. One could not, Charles Gifford
argued, erase every symbol of the nation's oldest bank, whose
venerable customers once included John Hancock and Paul Revere.
</P>
<P>
   In a barometer of changing times, the new company created out of
the megamerger of Fleet Financial Group and BankBoston will
popularly be known as ``Fleet.'' But in a nod to tradition, some
less visible parts of the new bank will be called FleetBoston
Financial _ a last-minute concession to Gifford, the old BankBoston
chief who holds the number-two position in the new company.
</P>
<P>
   In another compromise, Fleet's new logo is an abstract, stylized
version of a winged eagle, the old BankBoston icon. The symbol
replaces Fleet's three sails, which prominent affordable housing
activist Bruce Marks had sought to tarnish in recent years by
comparing to shark fins.
</P>
<P>
   The symbolic changes, which company executives unveiled Monday
in a ceremony with soccer star Mia Hamm and Red Sox celebrity
short-stop Nomar Garciaparra, are the result of an emotional
tug-of-war between Gifford and Terrence Murray, the hard-driving
Fleet chief executive who acquired his crosstown rival for $16
billion earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as three weeks ago, Murray had insisted that the
entire company, now the nation's eighth-largest bank, bear the
Fleet name alone and retain the three sails, insiders familiar with
the situation said Monday. ``I realize there's a great deal of
nostalgia and thinking back to the past,'' Murray said Monday, as
he and Gifford hoisted a corporate flag outside BankBoston.
``However, the '90s is a period of enormous change.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gifford dug in his heels and forced his new boss to make
some concessions. ``Boston is part of me,'' Gifford said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of Gifford's fierce lobbying in recent weeks, the
name of the holding company uniting various parts of the bank will
be FleetBoston Financial. That is not a name consumers will
encounter much, unless they read the company's annual reports or
follow Wall Street research.
</P>
<P>
   And the logo accompanying the holding company name will bear a
1784, the year the Massachusetts Bank, which eventually became
BankBoston, was founded to finance Yankee merchant trade with
China. Fleet's new ticker symbol on the New York Stock Exchange is
FBT.
</P>
<P>
   In a rapidly consolidating industry, banks change names all the
time. And mergers that combine two companies with different
philosophies and practices involve painful decisions and personal
sacrifices. Murray, a Woonsocket, R.I., factory worker's son and a
veteran of more than 50 deals, has had to craft ways to work with
Gifford, a Rhode Island banker's scion who grew up in privileged
circles. Gifford is the new Fleet's president and chief operating
officer, and is active in community affairs.
</P>
<P>
   But research showed the name `Boston' did not travel well
outside Massachusetts, where Fleet has many branches. ``We wanted
geographic freedom,'' said Anne Finucane, who heads Fleet's
corporate marketing and communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fleet'' is the name people and businesses will see when they
look at the new bank, which has eight million household customers
across New England and the Northeast. Branches, automated teller
machines, checks, stationery, business cards, billboards at Fenway
Park, and advertisements on television, in newspapers, and
elsewhere will all bear the Fleet name.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at branches and ATMS the name ``Fleet'' stands against a
green backdrop _ another small concession to Gifford. The old Fleet
used only blue, not green.
</P>
<P>
   The new Fleet will keep the BankBoston name in Latin America,
where BankBoston opened in 1917 to finance the New England wool
trade and is a widely recognized brand. BankBoston's investment
bank, BancBoston Robertson Stephens, will drop its first name.
Other units, including Fleet's Quick &AMP; Reilly stock brokerage, will
retain their names.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say that the deliberations we went through didn't
involve some give and take,'' said Gifford, who said his
relationship with Murray had strengthened as a result of the
process. Fleet's brand name, Gifford admitted, was ``much better
known'' _ a point he said was hammered home during a recent visit
to Yankee stadium, where Fleet is a big advertiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chad has had to make many difficult decisions in the past six
months,'' said Murray, adding that ``every day my respect and
admiration for Chad has grown. Choosing a brand and a logo is
certainly a test of our partnership.'' The two men were speaking to
company executives before the flag-raising ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Murray said Fleet, which has $175 billion in assets, will
produce $3 billion in excess capital, or money available for
investments, stock buybacks, and shareholder dividends, over the
next 18 to 24 months. He said Fleet was unlikely to do acquisitions
``of any significance'' in the next nine months, but did not rule
out smaller nonbank acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Murray also said the imminent dismantling of Depression-era laws
separating banks, insurers, and brokerages would create
opportunities. ``I think this has major potential for our new
company,'' he said. ``We're going to continue to build this into
one of the premier financial services companies in the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray, who temporarily called his company Fleet/Norwest after
one major acquisition but soon dropped the second name, vowed not
to erase the word Boston from the holding company as long as he
heads it. Murray is scheduled to retire at the end of 2001, when
Gifford is due to take over.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet's new logo confused some observers. When showed the symbol
by a reporter, Carol O'Grady, a 55-year-old insurance clerk, asked
``What is that _ two half moons?''

BMW TO RAISE STAKE IN ROLLS-ROYCE , ITS AEROSPACE PARTNER 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ BMW will raise its stake in Rolls-Royce PLC to 10
percent and give the British aerospace concern control of a joint
venture that builds plane engines, the companies said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   BMW, which now owns 2 percent of Rolls-Royce, said it would buy
33.3 million new Rolls-Royce shares and 90 million existing shares
under the deal. The arrangement, which contributed to a nearly 19
percent surge in Rolls-Royce stock Monday, will make BMW, Germany's
No. 3 automaker, the biggest industrial shareholder in Rolls-Royce,
with a stake worth about $545 million.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Reitman, an auto industry analyst with Merrill Lynch,
said the maneuver would enable BMW to avoid probable development
costs in the money-losing airplane engine venture and benefit from
the overall profitability of Rolls-Royce.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market has never looked kindly at BMW's foray into
airplane technology,'' he said. ``What the market will welcome in
this is that it re-focuses BMW on its core activities.''
</P>
<P>
   BMW's worries about the profitability of its investments have
been deepening with stubborn losses at its Rover auto subsidiary in
England. The German company says it will make Rover profitable by
2002 _ the same year as BMW-Rolls-Royce Aerospace, the joint
airplane engine venture, is anticipating a profit. ``There was
probably less scrutiny of the losses at BMW-Rolls-Royce when that
was the only problem area,'' Reitman said. ``Now that there are big
problems at Rover, it's a different situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The joint venture was formed in 1990 to develop the BR700
engines used in airplanes including the Gulfstream V corporate jet,
the Bombardier Express, the Boeing 717 and the Nimrod 2000, a
maritime reconnaissance plane built by British Aerospace PLC. The
company delivered around 100 engines last year and forecasts an
increase to 210 next year and 250 in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal announced Monday, BMW will relinquish its 50.5
percent stake in the joint company, which will be run as a German
subsidiary of Rolls-Royce GmbH, with its headquarters near Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Rolls-Royce is to assume the entire debt of the joint venture,
estimated by BMW at $546 million _ roughly the same as the value of
its new stake in Rolls-Royce.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement raised speculation that BMW might bid for
Rolls-Royce, but both sides denied this.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have expressly said they see no reason to increase the
stake,'' John Rose, the chief executive of Rolls-Royce, told
reporters. And, he said, BMW had not asked for representation on
the Rolls-Royce management board.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was the second remolding of the Rolls-Royce corporate
profile in a matter of weeks. In September, Rolls-Royce agreed to
buy Vickers PLC for $933 million.
</P>
<P>
   Rolls-Royce PLC is not directly related to Rolls-Royce Motor
Cars Ltd., the maker of luxury automobiles that was bought by
Volkswagen AG of Germany last year.

FRENCH CONSORTIUM BUYS STAKE IN EMBRAER, BRAZILIAN AIRCRAFT MAKER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada, Fla.)   By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ A French aerospace consortium agreed Monday
to acquire a stake in Empresa Brasileira de Aeronautica SA, a
rapidly growing aircraft maker that is one of corporate Latin
America's biggest success stories.
</P>
<P>
   A group composed of Dassault Aviation, Thomson CSF,
Aerospatiale-Matra and Snecma will pay about $209 million for 20
percent of the voting shares in Embraer, as the Brazilian company
is known. With the deal, the French companies could gain an
advantage in bids to renovate Brazil's fleet of fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is win-win for both sides,'' said David Wheeler, a Bear,
Stearns managing director here. ``Embraer gets access to strong
technological and commercial networks and the French, especially
Dassault, get stronger footing in Latin America's defense market,
with the potential for $8 billion in contracts in Brazil alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Embraer's alliance with the French companies is the latest
chapter in a turnaround that has resulted in one of Latin America's
highest-flying companies, and one of its hottest stocks, with
shares soaring 335 percent in dollar terms this year. The French
group will pay a 25 percent premium over the closing price last
week of 6.8 reais, or $3.45.
</P>
<P>
   Since its privatization in 1994, Embraer, which was created by
the Brazilian military 30 years ago in a rush to catch up with the
aerospace prowess of the rich industrial nations, has been
transformed from a money-losing behemoth. Its competitive strength
has shaken the largest producers of commercial jets _ Boeing,
Airbus Industrie and Bombardier of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Embraer's success reflects a prescient bet on a growing
demand for regional jet aircraft able to shuttle 100 passengers or
so on short flights.
</P>
<P>
   The market for regional jets has become the fastest-growing part
of the commercial aircraft industry, reflecting the efforts by
small feeder airlines to replace older planes with jets, which most
passengers prefer. The increase of commerce in the 1990s in
developing nations has also contributed to the demand for small
jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are about 1,000 Brazilian companies doing business in
Argentina today, compared with a couple of hundred a few years
ago,'' said Robert Booth, a Florida-based Latin American aviation
consultant. ``Imagine the impact that has on the need to transport
all those businessmen around.''
</P>
<P>
   After amassing contracts in the United States, Latin America and
Europe, Embraer has a backlog of orders worth about $18 billion.
The company is now seeking to expand its business in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The deal announced Monday suggests that the company is
readjusting to focus more on the armaments market. Now, about 8
percent of Embraer's sales come from military orders, such as the
Brazilian government's contract for radar-equipped jets to help
combat drug-running in the Amazon River basin. Within a few years,
as much as 30 percent of its sales could come from armaments
business, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already have 15 air forces around the world flying our
planes,'' said Mauricio Botelho, president of Embraer. ``Of course,
we want to expand that number. And of course, since we're linking
up with the makers of supersonic fighter jets, we want to help our
partners win contracts on our home turf.''

DREAMWORKS AND IMAGINE JOIN TO CREATE A WEB SITE OF DIGITAL
ENTERTAINMENT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ In what its principals say is a first glimmer of the
rapidly approaching digital entertainment world, executives at
Dreamworks SKG and Imagine Entertainment said Monday they would
join to create a new Internet entertainment company and Web site
offering short films, streaming video, live events, games,
performance art, continuing series, ``nonlinear interactive
features'' and whatever else they can think of.
</P>
<P>
   Dreamworks, a ministudio formed by Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey
Katzenberg and David Geffen, announced the partnership with
Imagine, a film and television production company headed by Ron
Howard and Brian Grazer, and vowed that the new company, to be
called POP.com, would be operating by early spring. The company is
to have offices in New York and Los Angeles, and the announcement
of its first chief executive will be made shortly, Spielberg said.
</P>
<P>
   POP.com is being financed by Vulcan Ventures, the investment
vehicle of Paul G. Allen, the Microsoft co-founder who is already a
major Dreamworks investor. Vulcan has committed $50 million for the
initial phase of the project, Katzenberg said. For that, Vulcan
will get 50 percent of the company; Dreamworks and Imagine will
split the other half.
</P>
<P>
   When it goes online, POP.com is to offer a daily menu of
interactive shorts it calls ``pops,'' most running between 30
seconds and six minutes. The emphasis will be on comedy, but no
genres will be ignored, Spielberg said, and each ``pop'' will come
with its own chat room and instant messaging capability.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to be so seductive and ultimately addictive that
people don't click out after one click,'' Grazer said.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg and Howard, both film directors, said they intended to
contribute their own ``pops'' to the site, though they added that
initially much of their work would be to encourage others to get
involved and to nurture the work of fledgling digital artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an emerging and evolving new format,'' Katzenberg
said. ``The analogy I keep coming back to is 25 years ago when you
had this wonderful style called music and someone said, let's turn
it into an audio and video experience, and out of that was born
MTV. We believe we are at that time and moment now for the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's announcement is indicative of the scurrying in
Hollywood in recent months to find ways to understand and
capitalize on the sweeping technological advancements in online and
digital filmmaking and utilize it to shape the entertainment world
of the future.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Howard said, they want to have some fun. ``This is kind of
free-wheeling, less about narrative drive and all the discipline we
have to live with when we make a movie and more about the
exploration of interesting new ideas,'' he said. ``I think we're
going to able to entice a lot of really talented people to do some
work with us.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``pops'' presented on the site might also be the seeds of
other, larger projects, from video games to television series to
feature films.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly see this as like a large, fertile field,''
Spielberg said. ``You can harvest all sorts of spin-offs, just from
whatever germinates. It could be a book, a piece of music, a movie,
who can say?''
</P>
<P>
   As word of the venture began to make the rounds in Hollywood and
in the investment community, most executives and analysts said they
wanted to reserve judgment until they could see exactly what was
planned, and how it might differ from other, perhaps smaller
Internet sites offering digital films.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do they promote it?'' asked one entertainment analyst.
``It's very nice to digitize films and put them on the Internet,
but where is the value in it for investors? I guess my initial
reaction is, `yeah, so?'''
</P>
<P>
   Digital moviemaking _ sometimes called microcinema _ is a
relatively small but growing movement of small-scale filmmakers
utilizing the cheaper and rapidly evolving digital technology to
make short films and exhibit them on the Internet. The October
issue of Wired magazine listed more than a dozen Internet sites
offering short digital films, among them Atomfilms _ which exhibits
shorts that are festival favorites or Academy Awards nominees and
counts as its partners the HBO and Warner Bros. Online units of
Time Warner _ and the Bit Screen, which offers short first-run
films and episodic series of 10 minutes or less.
</P>
<P>
   POP.com will be different, its founders say, in the scope of its
ambitions, the people associated with it and the strategies it will
use to turn a profit. They intend it as a money-making enterprise.
``We definitely see this as an advertiser and sponsor-supported
business,'' Katzenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   In coming weeks, POP.com plans to talk with Madison Avenue
executives about ideas for advertising on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the same way that we have to really discover these new
forms, Madison Avenue is going to have to reinvent the way it
advertises to this kind of viewer,'' Katzenberg said. ``Each step
that is being taken in this world today is a first step. All of us,
individually and collectively, are on as big a learning curve as
you can be on. There are no rules, and there is no proven formula
for success in this as yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg said they did not intend to corner the market in
digital filmmaking or to muscle out weaker competitors. ``I think
there will be many stimulating sites in the future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will still be movies, and there will still be TV,''
Grazer added. ``We're not thinking we're changing the world. We're
just trying to be a part of the sensibility of this new medium.''

 &HT;    As Bush debuts campaign ads, Forbes ready to counterBy Ken
Herman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Aware that his name is better-known than his
record, Texas Governor George W. Bush today launches a TV ad
campaign aimed at filling in the blanks before his opponents try to
do it for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire campaign is designed not only to communicate the
governor's positive message but it also anticipates some of the
attacks that have already begun in the media,'' said Mark McKinnon,
Bush's media consultant.
</P>
<P>
   On TV today in Iowa and New Hampshire, key early states in the
race for the GOP presidential nomination, are four ads in which
Bush says he can do for the nation what he's done for Texas.
Included is a statement of philosophy that could be taken as a hint
of a promise to cut taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that once top priorities have been funded we should
pass money back to the taxpayers,'' he says on an ad. ``That's what
I've done in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   In a low-key, but intentional, way, one of the ads seeks to
shore up a flank on which Bush expects to be targeted in upcoming
ads from GOP foe Steve Forbes, a wealthy publisher who has vowed to
spend whatever it takes to get his message across.
</P>
<P>
   That message includes an attempt to portray Bush as a
tax-and-spender unworthy of the conservative label.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they do things big down in Texas,'' Forbes said this
month. ``But it does seem curious that Governor Bush makes
big-spending Bill Clinton look like a fiscal conservative. Under
President Clinton, federal spending has increased 21 percent. Under
Governor Bush, Texas spending has increased by 36 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the last budget approved before Bush took office, state
spending totalled $35.8 million. Spending for the fiscal year that
begins next September will top $48.6 million, a 36 percent hike.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has noted that the increase includes more federal funds for
some programs, as well as an initial infusion of money from the
settlement of the lawsuit against the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   One of the new Bush ads portrays him as a governor who has held
the line on spending increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``As governor, he signed the two biggest tax cuts in Texas
history,'' says an announcer. ``He reduced the growth of state
government spending to the lowest in 40 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaign spokesman Scott McClellan said that claim is based on
year-to-year budget increases since Bush took office. Forbes
adviser Greg Mueller said Monday that Forbes, in coming weeks, will
run ads challenging Bush's handling of taxpayers' money.
   ``We believe in an honest, civil, respectful debate on the
issues,'' said Mueller.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, that included an aggressive ad campaign that
left Bob Dole as damaged goods by the time Forbes was eliminated
from the race for the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Bush's) record on taxes and spending and education are
certainly areas deserving of an engagement on the issues,'' Mueller
said of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Briefing papers used within the Forbes campaign discuss Bush's
``bushels of wasteful spending'' in ``traditionally wasteful and
intrusive arms of government.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush, in one ad, says he cut taxes, the Forbes campaign
says he does not point out that due to other economic pressures,
including increasing property values, many Texans did not benefit.
Some are paying higher tax bills.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has noted that Bush unsuccessfully pushed a package of
tax increases in 1997 as part of plan to cut property taxes. His
proposal failed, and lawmakers settled on an alternative that had
far less impact than Bush wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Forbes are primed for a high-dollar airwaves war. Bush
has broken records by raising more than $57 million in seven
months. Forbes, heir to a publishing empire, has already spent more
than $16 million of his own money and there's more where that came
from.
</P>
<P>
   Both are declining federal matching funds, a decision that also
frees them from state-by-state spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign officials would not detail the cost of the ad buy,
but they termed it a ``mid-sized one'' and said average viewers in
those states would see the ads three to five times per week.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the air is a 60-second Spanish radio ad running in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spotlight is on Iowa,'' the ad says. ``And for the first
time it's shining on the Latino community.''
</P>
<P>
   In the TV ads, Bush, packaged as ``A fresh start for America,''
talks about setting a new political tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to run a campaign that is hopeful and optimistic and
very positive,'' Bush tells viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush ads brought protest from the Texas Democratic Party,
which claim they ``exaggerate a lackluster record.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Democratic National Committee spokesman Rick Hess
declared the ads substance-free, and filled with ``platitude after
platitude full of warm and fuzzy words.''
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, Bush launches what could become the most massive ad
buy in presidential history at a time when he is declining to
debate his opponents until Dec. 2 because he said voters are not
paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   It's a discrepancy that did not go unnoticed Monday in the John
McCain campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seems like the ads would be a waste of money if nobody is
paying attention,'' said McCain spokesman Howard Opinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look like good ads,'' Opinsky added. ``And I'm hopeful
the governor will come up and talk about them in person in New
Hampshire some time soon.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   FALLS CHURCH, Va. _ Pat Buchanan put aside a lifetime of
Republican fervor Monday and shifted his lagging presidential quest
to a run for the Reform Party nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our vaunted two-party system is a snare and a delusion and a
fraud upon the nation,'' Buchanan told a crowd of cheering
supporters as he bolted the GOP, showing his fiery instinct for
insurgency. ``Our two parties have become nothing but two wings on
the same bird of prey.''
</P>
<P>
   As visceral on the stump as ever, Buchanan, his campaign for the
Republican nomination frozen in the single-digit doldrums,
lambasted the two major parties as havens for big-money donors and
``hollow'' candidates who have ``rigged the game'' against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We choose not to play our assigned walk-on role in their sham
election,'' Buchanan declared to the delight of an exuberantly
partisan crowd that included Reform Party officials and loyalists
from his three failed bids for the Republican presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only the Reform Party offers the hope of a real debate and a
real choice of destinies,'' he insisted in resorting to the
alternative ticket created by Ross Perot as a lever of populist
power in the 1992 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   In a bizarre contest for the 2000 nomination taking shape
between Reform Party factions, Donald Trump, the real estate
millionaire, is quitting the Republican Party and threatening to
challenge Buchanan, denouncing him as a ``Hitler lover.'' Minnesota
Gov. Jesse Ventura, the party's major elected figure, is looking
with open disfavor on Buchanan's party-switching gambit. And while
Perot is proclaiming neutrality in any rivalry, even the
Buchananites agree Perot remains a quixotic figure.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Buchanan confirmed his third-party course, he was
attacked by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican
front-runner who is considered the candidate most likely to lose
votes in November should Buchanan attract serious numbers of
conservative voters. Insisting that Buchanan left the GOP for no
reason other than a failed candidacy, Bush scored Buchanan's
isolationist views, in particular his controversial thesis that
Hitler initially had presented no serious threat to the United
States in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat sees an America that should have stayed home while Hitler
overran Europe and perpetrated the Holocaust,'' Bush contended in a
statement expressing confidence that most conservative Republicans
would not follow Buchanan. In the weeks leading up to Buchanan's
announcement, Bush had refrained from harsh criticism of him in the
hope of keeping him in the party.
</P>
<P>
   But Buchanan hardly apologized for his views as he rued the
decline of ``all the great empires of Europe'' and the rise of ``a
superstate in Europe that pays homage to the great god, Mammon''
and, he said, ties up American soldiers in a ``Godless new world
order.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They call us isolationists, and that's one of the nicest
things they call us,'' he declared, drawing laughter from the crowd
at the Doubletree Hotel here in the western Washington suburbs,
miles from what Buchanan termed ``the Beltway elites.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, if they mean I intend to isolate America from all the
bloody, territorial, tribal and ethnic wars of the 21st century, I
plead guilty!'' he boomed, drawing the crowd to its feet in a wave
of applause and cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Once more offering himself as the unabashed candidate of
America-first policies, Buchanan vowed to ``rescue our lady,
America'' from what he termed ``the cultural and moral pit into
which she has fallen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a timeout on legal immigration to ease the downward
pressure on workers' wages,'' he maintained, ``and to defeat the
forces of separatism that threaten us and nations all over the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   With fresh campaign logos and a new red, white and blue Internet
site (www.buchananreform.com), the 60-year-old politician sought to
retool his candidacy with a speech laced with the sorts of red-meat
applause lines that first brought him success as a speechwriter for
President Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd roared as he denounced President Clinton as ``our own
Elmer Gantry, whose desecration of the temples of our civilization
and personal misconduct disqualify him'' as the nation's leader.
</P>
<P>
   The Buchananites roared again as he declared, ``The appeasement
of Beijing is a bipartisan disgrace!''
</P>
<P>
   And they stood and cheered as he bitterly denounced the Supreme
Court and vowed to ``herd the justices back into the narrow
stalls'' of constitutionalism. ``What is a self-governing people
doing meekly waiting each week for nine jurists to tell us how we
may live and how we should govern ourselves?'' he demanded, playing
to the Reformists' libertarian instincts even as he denounced the
legalization of abortion in ``that abomination they call Roe vs.
Wade.''
</P>
<P>
   Wielding a pallette filled with shades of national sovereignty,
Buchanan attacked employment quotas as un-American, declaring:
``The backsliding toward hyphenated Americanism must end.'' In
short order, he attacked the United Nations, global economic
treaties and ``IMF bailouts of deadbeat dictators.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In abandoning a Republican primary contest dominated solidly so
far by Bush, Buchanan set a course in which he must now fight state
by state within the evolving Reform Party factionalism to win
enough support for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get on 30 ballots,'' said Bay Buchanan,
Buchanan's sister and chief strategist. She noted that the campaign
already had hired Matt Sawyer, an election-law specialist who
helped Perot navigate the dense thicket of widely varying state
election laws in creating the party.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the 30 states that Ms. Buchanan is targeting, the Reform
Party is already established in 20 states where the Buchanan camp
is counting on help from such Reform Party veterans as Pat Choate,
Perot's confidante and former vice presidential running mate. He
has been openly piloting Buchanan`s veer toward the Reform ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Choate conceded that Buchanan might have a problem in the
opposition to his candidacy expressed by Ventura, who is
encouraging talk of a Trump candidacy. ``It's not helpful, but it
will not keep him from getting the nomination,'' Choate said of
Buchanan's chances, estimating that the enthusiastic crowd of more
than 300 people here included a majority of the party's current
state chairmen.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have charged that money, not principle, prompted the
party switch by Buchanan. The Reform Party nominee will be entitled
to $12.6 million in federal campaign funds. But Bay Buchanan denied
that this was at the root of the Reform venture, while Buchanan
insisted that disgust drove him from the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Party has been good to me,'' he told the crowd.
``And I have tried to be loyal to it. But as John F. Kennedy said,
`Sometimes party loyalty asks too much.' And today, it asks too
much of us.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Expressing anguish at quitting his lifelong party, Buchanan
nonetheless beamed in summoning his followers to a new course,
using his old imagery of an assault on the castle of the
establishment. ``You don't know this peasant army,'' he said,
grinning. ``We have not yet begun to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, ever a history buff, noted that this was St. Crispin's
Day _ a reference to King Henry V's defeat of the superior forces
of France in the battle of Agincourt on this day in 1415. ``Let's
make a little history,'' he said, looking eager as he took up a
different battle flag.

FORMER GM AND VW EXECUTIVE WANTS A LOPEZ IN EVERY GARAGE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Spain, Brazil, Germany)   By AL GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMOREBIETA, Spain _ Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua has long
dreamed of building a car factory here in his Basque hometown. But
that dream caused him, by his own reckoning, to commit the biggest
mistake of his life.
</P>
<P>
   The mistake, he said, was defecting in 1993 from the executive
suite at General Motors, which declined to build the advanced,
cost-efficient plant he envisioned, and joining Volkswagen, which
he said promised to build it but never did.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had known that, I wouldn't have changed. It was my
error,'' said Lopez, 58, the one-time purchasing star under John F.
Smith Jr., GM's chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Even after all he has been through, Lopez clings to his dream _
although it means performing the seemingly impossible feat of
producing his own car from scratch, independent of any auto giant.
</P>
<P>
   While at GM and VW, Lopez said his vision was a new system to
build the cars. But now, he has helped design them, too, entering a
tricky field, one in which daring entrepreneurs like John Z.
DeLorean and Preston Tucker had their own problems getting their
ideas to market. DeLorean's sports-car company ended in bankruptcy,
a trial for drug-dealing that ended with DeLorean's acquittal, and
a flurry of lawsuits nearly two decades ago. Tucker managed to
build only a handful of his ``cars of the future'' in the late
1940s before his enterprise crumbled.
</P>
<P>
   As for Lopez, GM accused him, after his defection, of passing
trade secrets to VW, including plans for an innovative factory
called ``Plant X.'' VW settled that dispute in 1997 _ the year
after Lopez had moved on yet again _ by paying GM $100 million and
agreeing to buy $1 billion in GM auto parts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, a tumultuous year for Lopez, a German court dropped
criminal charges of corporate spying against him, while fining him
$230,000, and he also survived a car crash in Spain that left him
in a coma for 10 days and hospitalized for six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Lopez never relinquished the vision of the car
factory. He spent $3.7 million on four prototype cars and locked
them in a subbasement in a Bilbao bank, 12 miles from his hometown.
Last month, he presented a plan for the $554 million factory to 200
potential partners and said it could open by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But in a rare departure from the vaunted can-do stance that
earned him, in his days as a cost-cutting executive, the nickname
``Superlopez,'' he also admits that the factory may never be built.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it doesn't go well,'' Lopez said, after driving by 260
acres of publicly owned, industrial-zoned land where he would like
to put the factory, ``at least you've tried, with all of your
hope.''
</P>
<P>
   But generally, Lopez has been optimistic. He said that in the
weeks since he approached investors, 200 firms have expressed
interest. He plans, by mid-November, to select his target of 52
auto parts suppliers, which would be minority partners in the
factory and jointly assemble the car.
</P>
<P>
   There have been some surprises, like the one from the Vizcaya
provincial government, owner of the large industrial plot in
Amorebieta. On Sept. 29, hours after Lopez's pitch to investors, it
issued a statement saying that no one had asked it to authorize the
car factory or participate as a shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez had been counting on support from provincial officials,
although he said four other local governments in Spain had offered
to take his factory. But in one that he named, the southern town of
El Puerto de Santa Maria, an official said there had been no talk
about building the factory locally when Lopez visited last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was going to do it in the Basque region, not here,'' said
Deputy Mayor Pedro Pablo Lamadrid.
</P>
<P>
   The factory would supposedly produce 300,000 cars annually using
cost-cutting innovations like a modular system to assemble car
sections and a work force of 5,900, drawn mainly from suppliers.
Only 100 workers would be from Lopez's supervising firm, which
would have a 52 percent stake in the venture.
</P>
<P>
   Similar techniques are used at a VW truck factory in Resende,
Brazil, that opened in 1996 under Lopez. He said his car factory
would improve the cost-cutting concept, which unions oppose on the
grounds that it outsources jobs.
</P>
<P>
   One proponent is Karel Bos, 71, chairman of the Bosal Group, a
Belgian-based manufacturer of auto exhaust systems that supplies
GM., VW and other big companies. He said that Bosal, with annual
sales of 610 million euros ($660 million), could account for three
of the 52 suppliers being sought.
</P>
<P>
   `` Lopez is a visionary person who has proven he can translate
his vision to reality,'' Bos said. ``He's done marvelous things at
VW and GM. We want to participate.''
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts question if the highly competitive European
market wants another car, even if Lopez can deliver his vehicles
with sticker prices of $9,600 to $16,000 _ about a third less, he
said, than equivalent Audis or Volkswagens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overproduction in the European market is legendary,'' said
David Healy, an auto analyst at Burnham Securities. ``It would be
tough breaking into this market as a small producer with 300,000
cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez's brand would be called Loar, a word that combines the
first two letters of his last names and also means ``laud'' in
Spanish. The prototypes permit a third person in the front seat
because the gear-shift box and emergency brake have been removed
from the front-center position. Each of the four models is named
for a Roman Catholic saint important in Lopez's life.
</P>
<P>
   The Our Lady of Carmen model, he said, is similar to an Audi A3
or VW Golf and is named for the patron saint of his hometown of
Amorebieta, reflecting his deep attachment to this medieval
village, in the green Basque hills, with 16,000 residents and 15
percent unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez crosses Amorebieta daily in his chauffeur-driven Audi A8
on the way to his consulting firm, Lopez de Arriortua &AMP; Asociados
SA. The company started in 1996 and has grown to 50 employees in
Europe and Brazil and annual revenues of $6.4 million. It just
moved to larger quarters in the town of Derio, near Bilbao.
</P>
<P>
   He said he also spoke frequently at seminars and donated the
fees to his hometown's Convent of the Carmelite Fathers of Larrea,
where he was married. He plans to build homes adjacent to the
convent for each of his three adult daughters and another for
himself and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, still a tall figure with a direct gaze, has put on weight
since his high-powered stint with the two big auto makers. He
maintains that he never took trade secrets from GM and that ``Plant
X'' was his idea.
</P>
<P>
   He is intrigued by the question, which he raised in front of
eight employees of his consulting firm, of what he would do if GM
and VW suddenly came to him with job offers, a throwback to March
1993 when he chose the offer from Ferdinand Piech, chairman of the
VW management board.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Lopez said, it would be GM.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if neither one calls, it doesn't matter,'' he added. ``I
have my family here, and I'm happy.''

CLINTON SIGNS $268 BILLION DEFENSE BILL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton signed the defense authorization
bill Monday, but vetoed a bill to fund the Commerce, Justice and
State departments in a move that sets the stage for a final
showdown with Republicans over next year's spending.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also threatened to veto two other bills this week that
would fund interior, labor, education and health programs, even
though a temporary government spending measure designed to prevent
a partial government shutdown expires Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are prepared to pass and send another stopgap
spending bill to Clinton before the Friday deadline in order to
keep all government operations running. Clinton said he would sign
it, but he implored Republicans to show ``good faith'' in
negotiating a final spending deal covering the remaining budget
items for next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will have to decide whether they want to work with me,''
Clinton told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton has agreed with Republicans that Social
Security money should be off limits, he insisted that there are
better ways to fund needed programs next year, such as closing
corporate tax loopholes and imposing stiff penalties on polluters.
</P>
<P>
   He also vowed to fight a Republican plan to impose a 1.5 percent
across-the-board cut in overall spending. He said the cuts would
affect important government programs while exempting a 4.5 percent
pay raise for House and Senate members, who also enjoyed a similar
salary increase last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not allow Congress to raise its own pay and fund its
own pork barrel projects and still make devastating
across-the-board cuts in everything from education to child
nutrition to the FBI,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the continued criticism, Republican leaders on Capitol
Hill praised Clinton for signing the defense measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's decision by the president shows that we can work
together and find agreement on the important issues facing this
country,'' said House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, who is
directing the GOP strategy in dealing with the White House on
budget matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, the president realized that, while there may be still
some disputes over the budget process, it is time to put partisan
politics aside and work together to further our security
interests,'' DeLay added.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had considered vetoing the defense bill, but ended up
signing it primarily because it contains a 4.8 percent pay increase
for military personnel and because Democrats appeared ready to join
with Republicans to override a veto.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also noted the $268 billion bill contains about a $4.8
billion boost in defense spending overall, even though he said it
is still filled with a number of ``pork barrel'' items he finds
objectionable.
</P>
<P>
   Although he didn't mention Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., by name, he singled out a $375 million ship building
project in Pascagoula for criticism that the senator got added to
the bill to benefit his hometown constituents. The ``mini-carrier''
project will cost $1.5 billion overall, but the Pentagon wanted to
postpone the start on it until at least 2005.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the bill contained a $15 million item slipped in by
Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska,
that would allow the Gulfstream aircraft company to conduct
research on ``supersonic aircraft noise mitigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lott and Stevens projects were just two of hundreds of
so-called ``add-ons'' designed to benefit special interests that
were written into the defense and other spending bills by House and
Senate members.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the other projects included money to fund research on
converting chicken manure into electric generating fuel, and
several hundred million for military facilities in California,
Texas and Wisconsin that are supposed to be closed.
</P>
<P>
   The military base money, which included funding for Brooks Air
Force Base in San Antonio, was described as ``transitional
funding'' to help ease the way for the area hit by the closing. As
it turns out, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., was
instrumental in helping to get the money for Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also criticized a $7 billion program in the budget for
routine maintenance and operations at military bases that
Republicans decided to label as ``emergency'' spending for next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency designation means that the money will not count
against spending limits for next year that Congress and Clinton
agreed to in 1997. But it will still have to paid for. Clinton
suggested that the money could end up coming out of Social Security
despite Republican claims to the contrary unless Congress works
with him to figure out other ways to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Clinton has signed eight of the 13 major appropriations
bills needed for funding the government next year. But by the end
of this week, a total of five bills will have been vetoed,
including the measure funding Commerce, Justice and State that
Clinton rejected Monday.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The president said he vetoed that $35 billion bill because it
did not meet his goal of hiring 50,000 more police officers or
provide enough money to support the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process and pay off the nearly $1 billion in delinquent U.S.
obligations owed to the the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   He also plans to veto a bill the House is likely to approve
Tuesday that would fund labor, education and health programs
because it does not include money to help hire new teachers and to
adequately protect the environment.

FORD TO INSTALL SAFETY BARS IN BIG PICKUPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Ford Motor plans to start installing hollow,
energy-absorbing steel bars below the front and rear bumpers of all
of its industrial-size pickup trucks in the 2001 model year to
reduce the risk that they will ride over cars in crashes, Ford
officials said in interviews Monday at a safety conference here.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is also studying the feasibility of adding such bars to
four-wheel-drive versions of the Ford Expedition and Lincoln
Navigator full-size sport utility vehicles and the F-150 pickup
truck, said Priya Prasad, Ford's top safety researcher. Resembling
in function the cowcatchers on the front of locomotives, the
horizontal bars are designed to catch the bumpers, reinforced door
sills and other safety features of cars.
</P>
<P>
   The Expedition is the nation's best-selling full-size sport
utility vehicle, while the F-150 is the nation's best-selling
vehicle over all. Four-wheel drive vehicles ride several inches
higher than two-wheel drive vehicles, making them potentially more
dangerous to other motorists.
</P>
<P>
   Putting the bars on industrial-size pickups, of which Ford sells
close to 350,000 a year, will be the latest in a series of recent
steps by automakers to make big sport utility vehicles and pickups
less dangerous to other motorists.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has already begun installing the bars on the giant Ford
Excursion sport utility vehicle, which went on sale this autumn but
is a fairly low-volume vehicle. And General Motors has redesigned
the bumpers on the 2000 Chevrolet Suburban and GMC Yukon to extend
four to six inches lower and has redesigned their bodies to ride
lower, though this was done partly to improve fuel economy and make
it easier to climb in.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's disclosure Monday coincided with the release of an
insurance industry study at the gathering here, the 43rd annual
Stapp Car Crash Conference. The insurance study looked at why sport
utility vehicles and pickups are more likely than cars of the same
weight to kill the occupants of vehicles they hit on the side.
</P>
<P>
   The study cited the high hoods and extra stiffness of the light
trucks. Automakers can reduce the deadliness for car occupants of
collisions with sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks by taking
three precautions that are technically feasible but are only done
now on a few models, insurance industry researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Putting side air bags in cars, installing energy-absorbing bars
like Ford's below the bumpers of sport utilities and pickups and
designing light trucks with lower hoods should improve the safety
of car occupants, said Adrian Lund, research director of the
Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which is seeking to cut the
cost of claims and conducted the tests.
</P>
<P>
   One finding from the crash tests, which were conducted the last
two years, was accidental, insurance researchers said. A Ford F-150
pickup truck with four-wheel drive used in one of the crash tests
happened to be equipped with two tow hooks mounted below the front
bumper. When the pickup slammed into the side of a 1992 Mercury
Grand Marquis full-size sedan, the tow hooks hit the base of the
car first, absorbing part of the impact and helping to push away
from the impact the car and within the car the driver's seat with
the crash dummy in it.
</P>
<P>
   When another F-150 pickup without tow hooks crashed into another
1992 Grand Marquis, the damage was much more severe, with the crash
dummy in the car absorbing more of the impact in the neck and chest
as the pickup's grille and head pierced the car.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Felrice, a former top regulator who is now the senior
manager of regulatory affairs at DaimlerChrysler, said the
institute's study was informative but that more work was needed,
particularly to assess the full range of possible crashes. ``It's
not sufficient to go redesign every vehicle so it crashes well into
a 1992 Grand Marquis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Occupants of sport utilities and pickups already have slightly
higher death rates than car occupants because the light trucks tend
to roll over more easily and are so rigid their occupants fare
poorly in collisions with fixed objects like bridge abutments.
</P>
<P>
   Prasad said that Ford's tests had found that adding bars below
the bumpers had no effect on the safety of sport utility and pickup
occupants.

 &HT;    Braves best ready themselves for all-out NY fan attack
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are the fans who have scripted their insults
for the Braves, who come into tonight's Game 3 of the World Series
here trailing 0-2 _ insults so filthy that even the no-holds-barred
New York Post couldn't print parts of them.
</P>
<P>
   There are fans with a slightly more subtle approach, such as the
guy whose mock Braves war chant reverberated through the clubby
Algonquin Hotel lobby Sunday night as he watched game highlights in
the bar: ``Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa,'' he droned on and on, ``Two down,
two to go . . . ``
</P>
<P>
   And then there are what might be the scariest of all Yankees
fans, the ones who never stop smiling the whole time they are
firing off insults like lethal brushback pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chipper Jones, Chipper Jones,'' Kurt Evans muttered as he
stared up at a TV in lower Manhattan's Blarney Rock bar Saturday
night, seeming to marvel aloud when Jones' home run gave the Braves
a 1-0 lead in game one. Referring crudely to Jones' extramarital
affair and subsequent divorce: ``He's got bigger things to worry
about than just beating the Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   A brief pause, and then Evans, a construction supervisor,
continued in the same loud, sincere tone that practically dared
anyone to disagree with him: ``Hell of a ballplayer, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Hell of an intimidating group, these Yankees fans.
</P>
<P>
   Vanquished at home, the Braves tonight take on perhaps their
toughest opponent yet in The Bronx. The reputation of Yankee fans
for tossing verbal brickbats _ and harder objects _ apparently is
no exaggeration.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Braves played a World Series game in Yankee
Stadium, in 1996, fans pelted their outfielders and bullpen
pitchers with everything from bagels and miniature bottles to coins
and radio batteries. Some players' wives reportedly were spit on in
the stands. Days earlier, during two playoff games with the Texas
Rangers, police had issued 164 summons for everything from scalping
_ tickets, that is _ to unruly behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves remember well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you play here, you can expect the crowd to be loud
and vocal,'' manager Bobby Cox said. ``I expect the same
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be very intimidating playing here because of the
crowd,'' outfielder Otis Nixon said.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the 1,000 off-duty New York police officers who
reportedly supplemented regular Yankee Stadium security during last
year's postseason games can protect the Braves from the verbal
abuse they're sure to suffer tonight. Playing for the other side in
the Bronx means being taunted nonstop.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what happens to players that Yankees fans like.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat in the bleachers this year and fans were yelling,
'Griffey, you suck!' `` said Joseph Maggio, who wore a Yankees cap
that looked as if it hadn't been washed in the 31 years he's been
following the team. ``This is Ken Griffey Jr., mind you, who's
probably the greatest centerfielder in history. And they knew it.
They just couldn't help themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the Braves who, most Yankees fans here agree,
have all but asked for it.
</P>
<P>
   Take John Rocker. Please.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bleacher Creatures can't wait to meet Mr. On-and-Off-His
Rocker,'' steamfitter Chuck Koebel, 48, crowed about the Braves'
outspoken reliever. ``I can't imagine what they'll say to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Um, how 'bout this?
</P>
<P>
   ``John Rocker,'' said Tylene Lezotte, an angelic-looking Yankees
fan who was booing Chipper Jones at the Blarney Rock on Saturday.
``He's the one who's inbred, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Yankees fans and Mets fans agree about almost nothing except the
inherent danger in wearing one team's T-shirt to the other's
stadium. But like Mets fans, Yankees fans despise Jones and Rocker
for having reversed the natural order. New York fans should be
dumping on the players, they say, and not the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   As for fans dumping on opposing fans, some Yankee Stadium
regulars who made it into Turner Field last weekend were amazed at
how hospitably they were treated by their Atlanta peers. Any fan
dumb enough to wear a Braves cap into Yankee Stadium tonight
shouldn't expect similar treatment, they warn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either you're going to take that hat off, or someone's going
to take it off for you,'' said Victor Calcano Sr., a Manhattanite
who was at Games 1 and 2.
</P>
<P>
   Some Yankees fans speculate that it's their environment that
makes them so _ what's the word? _ outgoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever Yankees fans come from _ Long Island, Queens, you
name it _ they gotta go in and out of the Bronx,'' said Michael
McHale, another burly steamfitter on lunch break. ``You've got to
be a true fan to want to go in and out of that place, and it's got
to have some temporary effect on people.''
</P>
<P>
   Others insist it's all heredity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You gotta remember, this is New York,'' said Maggio, the Ken
Griffey Jr. defender, smiling almost helplessly. ``It's who we
are.''

PLAYMAKERS ABSENT FROM UCLA'S ATTACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA's seven points against Cal and Oregon State
are its lowest two-game total in 35 years. Sure, the young
offensive line and rookie quarterback are partly to blame. But the
Bruins can't score without big plays, and they can't make big plays
without their playmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, tailback DeShaun Foster and receivers Danny Farmer
and Brian Poli-Dixon combined for 31 of UCLA's 62 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   This year, they have eight.
</P>
<P>
   Poli-Dixon broke his wrist against Fresno State and is out for
the season. Foster sprained his right ankle against Stanford,
played sparingly in two games, then missed Cal and Oregon State.
Farmer played three snaps against Oregon State because of a
strained groin.
</P>
<P>
   Their absence is obvious: In the last two games, the Bruins have
just four plays longer than 20 yards, and two were quarterback
scrambles. As a result, they can't stretch defenses, which puts
more pressure on the struggling line and freshman quarterback Cory
Paus.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a young quarterback, you have to find a way to
take the pressure off him,'' offensive coordinator Al Borges said.
``We haven't done that.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's daily medical report lists Foster and Farmer as
questionable for Saturday's game against Arizona. Neither is
expected to practice at full speed.
</P>
<P>
   Best-case scenario for Foster: ``He'd practice some and
hopefully play 10-12 plays and give us a spark,'' Bruins coach Bob
Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Best-case scenario for Farmer: ``I don't think he could play the
whole game,'' Toledo said, ``but at least he could help us.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury update: Cornerback Jason Bell (heel) isn't ready this
week and probably will redshirt. He hasn't played since the Ohio
State game.
</P>
<P>
   Tight end Mike Seidman (sprained shoulder) and linebacker Marcus
Reese (sprained foot) are questionable.
</P>
<P>
   Fullback Durell Price (sprained toe) and linebacker Robert
Thomas (concussion) are probable.
</P>
<P>
   __ The good: Winless on the road, UCLA plays its last three
games in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   __ The bad: Since starting the 1998 season 10-0, the Bruins have
lost seven of their last 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   __ The ugly: In their last nine quarters _ beginning with the
fourth quarter of the Oregon game _ the Bruins have been outscored
91-7.
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: For the second consecutive week, Toledo did
not name players of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Rusty Williams and tailback Keith Brown will join
the season-long selections, Farmer and Pete Holland, as captains
this week.
</P>
<P>
   __ Latest inductees: UCLA will enshrine 12 former coaches and
athletes into its Hall of Fame on Saturday before the Arizona game.
</P>
<P>
   They are: football players Troy Aikman, Sam Boghosian, Dave
Dalby and Ernie Johnson; golfer Kay Cockerill; softball player
Tracy Compton; three-sport star Denise Corlett; track star and
Olympian Gail Devers; water polo and swim coach Bob Horn; baseball
player Torey Lovullo; gymnast Sharon Shapiro, and track star Kevin
Young.
</P>
<P>
   There is an invitation-only ceremony before kickoff, but the
inductees will be announced at halftime. Aikman is not expected to
attend.

 &HT;    Film star McConaughey arrested in Texas
 &HT;    By Bob Banta
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ ``It wasn't bad for a night,'' Matthew
McConaughey said Monday afternoon. ``But I wouldn't rent a place in
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus the 29-year-old movie star and University of Texas grad
reviewed the Travis County Central Booking Facility, where he had a
room reserved after Austin police came to his Tarrytown home
because of a loud music complaint, found him dancing naked with
some bongo drums, and claimed to have seen a marijuana bong lying
on the coffee table.
</P>
<P>
   McConaughey was arrested and charged with resisting
transportation _ struggling with cops as they tried to put him in a
patrol car. The class A misdemeanor punishable by up to a year
behind bars and a fine up to $4,000. No drug-related charges have
been filed.
</P>
<P>
   People in the lobby of Municipal Court _ most of them waiting to
pay parking tickets _ cheered McConaughey as he exited the elevator
with his attorney, Joe Turner.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had no warrant to go into his house,'' said Turner, who
successfully defended singer Willie Nelson against marijuana
possession charges in 1995 after the country singer was arrested
sleeping in his car near Waco. ``A citizen has a right to object
when police handle you that way.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a sworn statement by Officer Michael Olson, he and
another patrolman arrived at the actor's cottage at about 2:30 a.m.
after someone complained of loud music.
</P>
<P>
   Olson said as he approached the door, he looked through a window
and saw McConaughey dancing naked and pounding on a set of bongos.
Another man in the living room was clapping to the music, according
to an arrest affidavit filed in Municipal Court. The second man was
not charged.
</P>
<P>
   Olson said he tried get McConaughey's attention by shining a
flashlight in the window, but McConaughey didn't notice. Olson said
he opened an unlocked screen door and entered the home after he saw
a bong sitting on a coffee table.
</P>
<P>
   The officer said that when he tried to talk to the actor,
McConaughey yelled, ``You can't be here,'' and started cursing him.
</P>
<P>
   Olson handcuffed and wrapped a long-sleeved shirt around the
actor and was trying to place him in a patrol car when McConaughey
shoved himself backward into the officer, almost causing both men
to fall.
</P>
<P>
   In his affidavit, Olson said the he smelled a faint odor of
marijuana when he went into the living room and described
McConaughey as glassy-eyed and smelling of alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Although police considered filing charges of possessing drug
paraphernalia against the actor, Municipal Court Presiding Judge
Penny Wilkov said it appeared that officers may have entered the
actor's home illegally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not illegal to have a bong on your coffee table,'' she
said. ``But the law also says that you cannot resist police when
they are trying to arrest you.''
</P>
<P>
   McConaughey, who was freed on $1,000 bail by Turner, declined to
talk about the incident. His neighbors described him as friendly
and well-behaved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid this will give the wrong impression of who Matthew
really is,'' said Lawrence Wright, a writer for New Yorker magazine
who has lived across the street from the actor for nearly two
years. ``He's quiet, friendly, loves to work in his yard, and has
made a great effort to live a normal life in a city he loves and
that loves him.''
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor, John Busch, 38, claimed that when he asked police
why they were arresting McConaughey, one of the officers pushed
Busch into some shrubbery. Busch said the officer later apologized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matthew is a very good neighbor,'' said Busch. ``He feeds my
dog when I'm out of town and I water his plants when he is gone.
When I was talking to him in the patrol car, he said, 'Everything
is going to be good, Johnny B. The Lord is looking after me.' ``

R.I. SENATOR JOHN CHAFEE DIES AT 77 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senator John H. Chafee of Rhode Island left the
Senate chamber for a final time Thursday afternoon, leaning heavily
on a cane as he limped down the stairs. He had just voted to
support a woman's right to an abortion, stubbornly defying his
Republican Party's leadership as he had for most of his 22 years in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do what I believe is right,'' Chafee liked to say.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, news of Chafee's death at age 77 brought Capitol Hill
to a virtual standstill, prompting a flood of tearful speeches and
tributes. Colleagues remembered him as a battle-scarred World War
II veteran, a powerful champion for the environment, a genteel
bridge-builder between opponents, and a doting father of five.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Chafee's quiet independence, coupled with his
unflagging honesty, that was remembered repeatedly on the Senate
floor. Indeed, friends said Chafee died having lived up to his
gubernatorial campaign slogan of 1962: ``A man you can trust.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't now and then. You always knew that when John Chafee
cast a vote, his conscience was clean,'' said Senator John W.
Warner, Republican of Virginia, who considered Chafee a friend for
three decades and served as his under secretary when Chafee was
secretary of the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Chafee, who announced in March he would not seek reelection next
year, died of heart failure at 7 p.m. Sunday at Bethesda Naval
Center after going to the hospital earlier that day, his aides
said. In August, Chafee underwent back surgery, but had never fully
recovered from a serious bout of pneumonia last year. He is
survived by his wife, Virginia, five children and 12 grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   His death was not announced until Monday morning, surprising
many of his colleagues who had seen him at work last week. With
flags across Washington lowered to half-staff, dozens of senators
took to the Senate floor to share their memories of Chafee.
</P>
<P>
   ``John was one of the great calming influences in this body, a
man of extraordinary common sense,'' said Senator John F. Kerry. He
said Chafee ``always tried to stand for principle _ not for party,
not for ideology, but for what was best.''
</P>
<P>
   It was perhaps for that reason that Chafee kept his Senate seat
for four terms after first being elected in 1976 to become the only
Republican to hold a Senate seat from Rhode Island in the last 68
years.
</P>
<P>
   Chafee, a descendant of one of the original five families that
settled Rhode Island, had a long history of public service prior to
that election. While still a student at Yale, he left to join the
Marine Corps in 1942, serving at Guadalcanal during World War II.
After graduating from Yale in 1947 and then from Harvard Law
School, Chafee was recalled to serve in the Korean War as a
rifleman in 1951 and 1952.
</P>
<P>
   He was first elected to office in 1956 as a Rhode Island state
representative and served until 1963, when he was elected governor
for the first of three terms. When Chafee first won the
governership _ by a mere 398 votes _ he created the slogan that
would last until his death.
</P>
<P>
   Chafee lost his bid for a fourth term as governor and lost a
Senate race in 1972 to the incumbent Democrat, Claiborne Pell. In
between those two elections, he served as secretary of the Navy
under President Richard M. Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, Chafee finally won an open Senate seat, launching a
career on Capitol Hill that would span four presidents and more
than two decades and would see substantial legislative
accomplishments ranging from the environment to health care.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among his accomplishments was the 1990 Clean Air Act,
which he helped create, as well as laws mandating the prevention
and control of oil spills. Members on both sides of the aisle
credit Chafee with helping pass laws expanding health care coverage
for women and children in his position on the Senate Finance
Committee. Just last week, he used his role on that committee to
push legislation that would restore funding cuts to medical schools
and nursing facilities, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He worked so hard to find a middle ground,'' said Senator
James M. Jeffords, Republican of Vermont. ``He just had that knack.
He was always so friendly and smiled and made it very difficult to
argue with him. He had a great sense of compromise _ and we saw
that with the Clean Air Act, saw it with health care, saw it with
the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In any age where politics all too often triumphs over policy,
Senator Chafee had the courage to stand up to th eleaders of his
own party. Over the years, Senator Chafee has become well known for
his willingness to do what is right for Rhode Island, and has been
extremely successful in achieving consensus on some very important
legislation,'' Patrick Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to helping forge national compromises, Chafee
crafted a regional coalition, the dwindling group of New England
Republican moderates who often formed a crucial voting bloc and ate
lunch together every week.
</P>
<P>
   The moderates' votes infuriated GOP leaders at times. Chafee and
his four colleagues _ Jeffords, Maine Senators Olympia Snowe and
Susan M. Collins, and Pennsylvania Senator Arlen Specter _ were
among just 10 Republicans who voted to acquit Clinton during his
impeachment trial. They also helped tip the balance in last week's
vote on an amendment in support of the Supreme Court's landmark
abortion decision, Roe v. Wade, which passed with 51 votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We often talked about our concerns about where the Senate was
heading,'' Collins said Monday. ``There were times I felt
discouraged, and he was always so proud just to be in the Senate,
even in the low points. He was just proud of the institution, and
of having served here.''
</P>
<P>
   When the five moderates ate lunch together in Chafee's office
last Wednesday, he appeared tired but in good health, Collins said.
But on Friday, Chafee's 77th birthday, he was too tired to go to
work, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   His death left two immediate political questions: Who would fill
his vacancy in the Senate, as well as his chairmanship on the
Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln Chafee, the senator's son and the mayor of Warwick,
R.I., already had declared he would run for his father's seat after
Chafee announced his retirement last spring. Several political
analysts in Rhode Island said Monday they expected Governor Lincoln
Almond, a Republican, to appoint the younger Chafee to the seat
until the November 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   But Almond said he would not make that announcement for at least
a week. And Representative Bob Weygand, a Democrat from Rhode
Island who is also running for the seat, said he hoped ``people
would take time out to allow the family to grieve, and the state to
grieve.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's time later on for the politics, but that should wait
for another day,'' Weygand said.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire is in line to fill Chafee's
seat as chairman of the environment committee. But because Smith
has switched from the Republican Party to become an Independent,
the chairmanship will likely go to Senator James M. Inhofe,
Republican of Oklahoma, Senate aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Chafee was the first senator to die in office since Quentin
Burdick, a Democrat of North Dakota, in 1992.

PAKISTANI REPORT ALLEGES GRAFT BY EX-PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
   (With PAKISTAN-MUSHARRAF) 
(DW) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pakistan's deposed prime minister, Nawaz Sharif,
skimmed hundreds of millions of dollars from public works, wheat
imports, sugar exports and other government projects, according to
detailed records compiled by the nation's most prominent criminal
investigator.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif, already under investigation by the nation's new military
government for obtaining huge unsecured loans from state banks,
enriched himself, his family and his friends in government deals he
conducted as prime minister, according to evidence compiled by the
investigator, Rehman Malik.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was running the government like his own private business,''
Malik said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Malik says he has hundreds of pages of records describing
Sharif's use of state power for profit. They appear to document a
decade of graft.
</P>
<P>
   It began when Sharif was a rising politician in the 1980s, grew
during his first term as prime minister, from 1991 to 1993, when he
was dismissed by Pakistan's president on corruption charges, and
continued in his second term, from 1997 until he was replaced in a
military coup two weeks ago, the records show.
</P>
<P>
   Since the coup, Sharif is being held under house arrest and
could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Malik, 47, was director-general of Pakistan's Federal
Investigative Agency, its equivalent of the FBI, and technically
still holds the post, though this month's coup has suspended the
work of government agencies in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Malik has spent five years looking into Sharif's financial
practices.
</P>
<P>
   Jailed by Sharif after his re-election in 1997, freed and
exonerated by Pakistan's Supreme Court a year later, he lives in
exile in London. He is well known at the FBI, the State Department
and the Secret Service, having helped to arrest Ramzi Yousef, the
convicted mastermind of the World Trade Center bombing, and his
associates in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The records, including government documents, signed affidavits
from Pakistani officials, bank files and property records, detail
deals that Malik says benefited Sharif, his family and his
political associates:
</P>
<P>
   _ At least $160 million pocketed from a contract to build a
highway from Lahore, his home town, to Islamabad, the nation's
capital. The money, he says, was generated by an inflated bid
accepted by Sharif. Malik says the extra $160 million took the form
of a gift to Sharif and his associates.
</P>
<P>
   _ At least $140 million in unsecured loans from Pakistan's state
banks, which he says went to finance companies owned or controlled
by Sharif.
</P>
<P>
   _ More than $60 million generated from government rebates on
sugar exported by mills controlled by Sharif and his business
associates.
</P>
<P>
   _ At least $58 million skimmed from inflated prices paid for
imported wheat from the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   In the wheat deal, Sharif's government paid prices far above
market value to a private company owned by a close associate of his
in Washington, the records show. Falsely inflated invoices for the
wheat generated tens of millions of dollars in cash.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Pakistan's new military ruler, Gen. Pervez Musharraf,
appointed Mohammed Yaqub, governor of the State Bank of Pakistan
and a 20-year veteran of the International Monetary Fund, as a
member of a new National Security Council to run Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Yaqub's tasks will include hunting down at least $4 billion in
unsecured loans from state banks _ including hundreds of millions
borrowed by Sharif and his associates _ that have disappeared in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Charges of political graft are nothing new in Pakistan. Sharif's
predecessor, Benazir Bhutto, has been convicted on corruption
charges in Pakistan, though she argues that the charges were
trumped up by Sharif and pliant prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Malik's evidence includes several intricate examples of what
Malik calls money laundering through a global network of
businesses, banks and bogus transactions from Lahore to London.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, he has traced the flow of $7.85 million, including
borrowed government funds, from Sharif's family business, the
Ittefaq Group. The money was transferred through money-changers in
the open-air bazaars of Peshawar, Pakistan, through five accounts
at the Bank of Oman, a Persian Gulf emirate, to 43 members of
Sharif's extended family.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, Malik tracked $1.85 million channeled through a
Swiss bank to accounts in Washington, London, Pakistan and the
British Virgin Islands that he said were controlled by Sharif, his
family and his friends.
</P>
<P>
   In a third case, he said that Sharif engineered government
policy for profit.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Sharif's government, desperately seeking foreign
currency, exported 350,000 tons of sugar to India. To spur the
exports, the government offered a rebate to sugar manufacturers of
about 10 cents a pound.
</P>
<P>
   There was a catch: the sugar would have to be exported by rail.
The government runs the railroads. When the trains were ready to be
loaded, at least 90 percent of the rail cars were reserved for
sugar produced by companies controlled by Sharif and his business
associates, Malik said.

   On his wrist, Payne Stewart wore a simple cloth bracelet, like
one a child might wear, with the letters WWJD.
</P>
<P>
   What Would Jesus Do?
</P>
<P>
   Monday afternoon, I hope He welcomed Payne Stewart, Robert
Fraley, and the three others who died with them into the Kingdom of
Heaven with open arms.
</P>
<P>
   Fraley and Stewart were friends of each other, and friends of
mine. Both were strong in their Christian faith and led their lives
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   I was much closer to Fraley, who was the agent for Stewart and
some top National Football League coaches, including Bill Parcells,
Tom Coughlin, Joe Gibbs, Bill Cowher, Buddy Ryan, and Ray Perkins,
to name a few, past and present.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, Fraley, Stewart, and Chuck Cook, Stewart's coach and
a close friend of Fraley's, formed a foursome with me at The
Country Club in Brookline, which was to be site of the Ryder Cup in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart wanted to play the course before going to Europe for the
British Open.
</P>
<P>
   Fraley and his wife, Dixie, stayed at our house for the next
three days. Dixie saw Boston with my wife, Denise, and Fraley
played golf with me at some local courses.
</P>
<P>
   During the second week in September, my wife, myself, my
daughter, Cara, the Fraleys, and Dixie's mother were all in New
York and went out to dinner in Manhattan the night before the
Jets-Patriots game.

<P>
   Robert Fraley was absolutely one of the finest people I have
ever met. He saw the glass as half-full. He saw the best in people.
I spent hundreds of hours in his company and never remember him
uttering a single profanity. A former quarterback at Alabama for
Bear Bryant, he was tough-minded but always fair.
</P>
<P>
   I became friends with Stewart through Fraley. Fraley and I were
playing golf years ago at Bay Hill in Orlando, where Stewart had a
house just off the 11th hole. When we got to the tee, Stewart
popped his head over the fence, holding his young son in his arms.
I kidded him about not taking the choke on a putt for $240,000 the
day before, in a Skins Game for TV. He responded, ``Putting for
money doesn't bother us. Putting in the Ryder Cup is a different
story. That's when we all choke.''
</P>
<P>
   That moment came back to me several times as I followed the
tragedy Monday. Stewart was always wonderfully straightforward. You
could needle him about anything and he would come right back at you
with a couple of funny lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payne really did a wonderful job turning his life around and
finding his spirituality the last few years,'' said Cook, via phone
from his Austin, Texas, home. Cook was due to join Stewart Tuesday
in Houston, where the Tour Championship will be played this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in a state of shock right now,'' said Cook. ``When I spoke
with Payne Monday (Sunday) he told me that he was having the
hardest time in his life playing golf. After winning the (US) Open
this year, and the Ryder Cup, he couldn't get himself motivated.
Winning the Ryder Cup was his No. 1 goal for this year. Winning a
major tournament was the second. He accomplished both of those.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said to me, `Now I have all these perks I worked toward,
these tournaments and Skins games coming up, and I can't get
motivated to play. The last two tourneys I played in, the Dunhill
Cup and Disney, I had no desire to play.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way Payne was. He was very candid. He didn't always
have the greatest tact, but he was very honest with himself and his
feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last few years he re-created his thinking, he developed
more feelings about things, and his beliefs became much more
important in his life. I feel good now, that he was able to resolve
a lot of things in his life before this happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook said Stewart was on his way to Dallas on a business trip,
to look at a piece of land that might be turned into a golf course.
Fraley and a business associate, Van Arden, who also worked for
Leader Enterprises out of Orlando, went with him. In recent years,
Stewart showed an interest in designing courses, as many top
professionals have done later in their careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sad day for golf, and everyone who knew Payne,''
said golf analyst Peter Kostis, who came to know Stewart well over
the years. ``Payne had things going for him in his life the way he
wanted them. He was happy with himself and his game. There just
isn't any way to say the right thing now.''
</P>
<P>
   Fraley played quarterback at Alabama on the same team with
former Red Sox manager Butch Hobson. He loved Bryant, who helped
him get into law school. Parcells gave Fraley his opening to the
big time when he hired him to negotiate his contract with the New
York Giants in 1983. Fraley never forgot it. Parcells introduced
him to other NFL coaches, who later hired Fraley, setting him up as
one of the top sports agents in America.
</P>
<P>
   There was one thing that made Fraley different from all of the
rest in his chosen profession. He never looked for publicity, never
wanted to be quoted. At one time, he represented about 10 of the
best coaches in the NFL and also was the agent for baseball stars
Orel Hershiser and Frank Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart and Fraley became fast friends when Stewart moved to the
Orlando area, so close that when Stewart and his wife traveled to
major tournaments, the Fraleys took care of their children.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart loved all sports. About a dozen years ago, he wanted to
come to Boston and see the Celtics play in Boston Garden before
Larry Bird finished his career. Stewart was a big Bird fan, and he
and the Fraleys stayed in town to watch the Boston Marathon. Fraley
came to Fenway Park many times to watch the Sox. When Stewart came
to Boston for the Ryder Cup, he was disappointed that the schedule
prevented him from seeing the Red Sox play.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, Fraley injured his shoulder and gave up golf.
This year, after the AT&AMP;T tournament in Pebble Beach, which has the
biggest pro-am in the country, Stewart challenged Fraley to start
playing again so that he could be Stewart's partner next year.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Stewart, Fraley, and Cook came to Boston to play in
Brookline. My wife and I picked them up at Logan after they landed
in a Learjet. Stewart had a deal with a company called Net-Jet to
fly for a certain number of hours a year. It was not always in the
same plane, so I have no way of knowing whether the jet that took
him to Boston was the same one that malfunctioned and crashed in
South Dakota Monday.
</P>
<P>
   We had a fun day at Brookline. Stewart, just a handful of days
after winning the US Open, was in great spirits. He wanted to play
The Country Club because he hadn't been on the course since 1988,
when the US Open was here.
</P>
<P>
   The people at The Country Club were very gracious, going out of
their way to accommodate us. There was a member-guest tourney that
day, but somehow they put us in the middle of it, and Stewart was
terrific to everyone.
</P>
<P>
   On the first tee, after a drive that carried everything down the
left side, he was walking alone when a maintenance cart carrying
two young workers pulled up near him. The kids wanted to say
something but didn't. So Stewart went over and talked to them for a
few minutes until he got to his ball.
</P>
<P>
   As we went around the course, a crowd gathered. Stewart kidded
with everyone who wanted to chat. About the 15th hole, he was
introduced to a young boy named Andrew, I believe, and they talked.
When we were walking to the clubhouse about 30 minutes later, he
stopped, looked back, and yelled to the boy by name, adding, ``Nice
to meet you. Take care of yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the four of us were sitting around having a soft drink,
waiting to go back to the airport. Stewart had several hours until
his flight, and he wanted to spend them there rather than at Logan.
In the midst of our conversation, a member came by and asked
Stewart what he had shot for the day. He answered, ``Par.'' The man
seemed unimpressed, so Stewart smiled and added, ``Par isn't bad.
Par just won the US Open on the final day. I'll take par when I
come back here for the Ryder Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   On the final day of that Ryder Cup, Stewart was a true
sportsman. He was paired with Colin Montgomerie, just behind Justin
Leonard and Jose Maria Olazabal, when Leonard sank his dramatic
putt on the 17th.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that happened, all the wind was taken out of everyone,''
said Cook, who was walking the course with him. ``There was no
sense in playing anymore. So Payne conceded the match to Colin.''
</P>
<P>
   This went down on Stewart's record as a loss in Ryder Cup play,
but he didn't care. Winning the Ryder Cup was more important. To
him, this was the ultimate in the game he loved, and the game that,
in his final season of playing, loved him back.
</P>
<P>
   Fraley grew up in a small town in Tennessee, with strong values
for family and religion. He treated everyone I ever saw him meet
with great respect. I remember asking him and Dixie once where they
were going on vacation. When they told me Israel, I asked why. And
Fraley answered, ``So we can go to the Holy Land and follow the
path of Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   WWJD. What Will Jesus Do? I think we know.

GOLFER STEWART AMONG THOSE KILLED IN LEARJET CRASH

<P>
   HOUSTON _ U.S. Open golf champion Payne Stewart and at least
four other people died Monday in their Learjet that crashed in a
swampy South Dakota field after an uncontrolled flight almost
half-way across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who was due in Houston on Tuesday to participate in the
Tour Championship, two of his agents and two pilots left early
Monday from Orlando, Fl were headed for Dallas when their
craft veered off course over Gainesville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The Learjet, believed to have been on autopilot, flew for more
than 1,600 miles before apparently running out of fuel near
Aberdeen, S.D., and crashing. There were no survivors, and
authorities said the victims were probably dead or unconscious
before the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said the craft may have suffered a
pressurization failure shortly after takeoff. Pilots of U.S.
fighter jets that were scrambled to shadow the stricken Learjet
reported its windows were iced over as it streaked northwest over
the nation's heartland.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, 42, one of the world's top golfers, was known and
recognizable for his trademark tam-o'-shanter cap and knickers,
called ``plus fours.'' He was remembered Monday as a dedicated
family man and an ambassador for his sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to express our sense of shock and sadness over
the death of Payne Stewart,'' said Tim Finchem, commissioner of the
Professional Golf Association Tour. ``This is a tremendous loss for
the entire golfing community and all of sports. Payne was a great
champion, a gentleman and a devoted husband and father. He will
always be remembered as a very special competitor, and one who
contributed enormously to the positive image of professional
golf.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sports agents on the plane were Robert Fraley and Van
Ardan. The pilots were identified as Michael Kling, 43, and
Stephanie Bellegarrigue, 27.
</P>
<P>
   Golf great Jack Nicklaus said he feared that one of his course
designers, Bruce Borland, 40, was also on the craft, but
investigators at the crash site said they could not tell how many
people were on board the plane.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration said Stewart's Learjet, a
1976 model Lear 35 of which he was reportedly a part owner, took
off at about 8:20 a.m. EDT from Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   After controllers lost communication with the craft when it was
over Gainesville, the next four hours were nothing but silence as
the plane raced toward its doom, sometimes reaching altitudes of
45,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, as an eyewitness described to the Reuters wire service,
the plane fell out of the sky like a rag and crashed in a grassy,
swampy field about two miles west of Mina, S.D.
</P>
<P>
   ``We assume it ran out of fuel,'' Maj. Tom Dravland, assistant
superintendent of the South Dakota Highway Patrol, told Agence
France-Presse. ``The wreckage is smoldering, but there is no
fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after communications were lost with the Learjet, an Air
Force fighter jet from Tyndall, Fla., which was on a routine
training exercise, was diverted to shadow it, joined later by two
other fighters from Eglin Air Force Base.
</P>
<P>
   When those planes had to turn back for fuel, two F-16s from the
Oklahoma Air National Guard in Tulsa began shadowing the Lear.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board dispatched a team to
South Dakota to investigate the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Bill Curry said Stewart's family was ``just trying to
survive right now'' as tributes to the popular golfer began to pour
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone just direct their prayers to the Stewart family,''
Curry said. ``That's the best thing anyone can do for the Stewarts
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart is survived by his wife, Tracey, and children Chelsea,
13, and Aaron, 10.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton, an avid golfer, said: ``I am
profoundly sorry for the loss of Payne Stewart, who has had such a
remarkable career and impact on his sport and a remarkable
resurgence in the last couple of years, and the members of his
group who were with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush praised Stewart as the ``epitome of
the gentleman sportsman.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart won three major championships _ the 1991 and 1999 U.S.
Open and 1989 PGA Championship _ and 15 other tournaments,
including the Shell Houston Open in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   He was a member of the U.S. Ryder Cup team that pulled off a
dramatic come-from-behind win over the European squad last month.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The impact of his death on this week's Tour Championship at
Champions Golf Club in Houston was uncertain. Finchem said
Tuesday's pro-am competition would be canceled and that the
tournament schedule will ``tentatively'' resume Wednesday ``pending
further information on the scheduling of memorial services.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellow PGA players gathering for the Tour Championship reacted
with shock and sadness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even comprehend the scope of it,'' said Tiger Woods, a
six-time winner on the PGA tour this year. ``There is an enormous
void and emptiness I feel right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Two-time U.S. Open champion Curtis Strange said, ``We have lost
someone who was truly a great ambassador for the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts said Monday it was premature to speculate on the cause
of the crash, but the icing observed on the windows of the plane
suggested a pressurization problem.
</P>
<P>
   Planes are pressurized because the thin air above 12,000 feet
becomes harder to breathe the higher one goes. To keep atmospheric
pressure inside a plane normal, pressurization systems pump
compressed air in while controlling how much is let out.
</P>
<P>
   Crashes caused by pressurization failures are virtually unheard
of in civil aviation, say experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can think of one other such case, a turbo-prop plane in the
1970s that crashed in the ocean after its pilots became
incapacitated,'' said Warren Morningstar, spokesman for the
Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pressurization systems are so simple _ it's usually easy to
recognize the problem, put on your oxygen masks and descend to a
lower level.''
</P>
<P>
   Morningstar said there was no common theme in the Learjet 35
accident reports to suggest pressurization problems.
</P>
<P>
   Incapacitated passengers and pilots can regain consciousness as
the plane plunges toward Earth, but that's rare, say experts. It
depends on the length of time each was unconscious, the steepness
of the descent and their physical condition.

PATRIOTS BANGED UP   AT KEY POSITIONS

<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Linebackers Marty Moore and Vernon Crawford
were hobbling Monday. Tedy Bruschi, who has missed the last two
weeks with a strained left knee, said he was ``90 percent'' and
would like to play Sunday in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Terry Allen, who sustained a concussion in last
Sunday's 24-23 win over the Broncos, said he had a slight headache
and was having more tests to determine whether he would be cleared
to play.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker and running back. Two important positions where the
Patriots were hurt Sunday. Allen is probably going to play against
the Cardinals, but coach Pete Carroll will have quite a problem on
his hands if he can't get Bruschi back and somehow has to adjust
the defense so they're always playing a nickel package with six
defensive backs.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Whigham, a.k.a. linebacker, looked a bit sore Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bobby Grier needs to get busy this week,'' kidded
Whigham, who took over at the weak-side spot when Moore and
Crawford went down.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford heroically returned but had no business being out there
with a sprained right knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``He helped us win a game,'' said Carroll. ``That's courage and
toughness and maybe it's being a little dumb. In the heat of
battle, sometimes guys can do some extraordinary things, and I
think he did one of those Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   At present there are two healthy linebackers, Andy Katzenmoyer
and Chris Slade.
</P>
<P>
   Grier, vice president/player personnel, will bring some people
in Tuesday for tryouts. Another possibility is to activate Fall
River's Marc Megna off the practice squad. Much depends on whether
the Patriots have enough salary cap space to bring in a veteran
like Dwayne Sabb, Pepper Johnson, or James Francis or whether
they'll have to bring in a younger player like Dana Cottrell, or
Ron Merkerson, who were on the roster the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see how the guys shape up when we look at them,'' said
Carroll. ``In my mind, we're doing everything we can to put the
linebacking position together right now. In my mind, a lot can be
settled if Tedy Bruschi can make it back. He wasn't close this past
week, but he tried.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen was injured on a third-quarter hit, the third hit he took
on the same play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a helmet-to-helmet (hit),'' said Allen. ``He laid a
lick on me. Those things happen. It's happened to me before. It
doesn't bother me except that I wasn't myself. But I'm all right. I
have a slight headache but I'm OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to talk them into letting me back on the field, but
they wouldn't let me out there.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the second concussion of his career, but he doesn't
believe he has suffered any long-term damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good,'' said Allen. ``I don't think it's anything
that's gonna bother me. Steve (Young) doesn't take the hits that I
take. If I was in that situation, I'd worry about it, but I'm not
going to worry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the injury, Allen had his best game in two years,
gaining 106 yards on 17 carries, and is excited about the
commitment the Patriots made to the run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't remember too much about the game, but we did a great
job,'' he said. ``You never know going in how it's gonna turn out.
All we had to do is execute and make people miss and run the ball
hard. We talked about what we wanted to do and we went out and did
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen was excited about turning the corner on a 39-yard run,
lauding a block thrown by Terry Glenn as the key. He also said Tony
Carter's lead blocking was superb. ``He's my personal protector out
there,'' said Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Allen's remark last week that this was ``the best offensive line
I've ever run behind'' elicited some snickers, but those linemen
took heed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They emphasize pass-blocking here because you have a guy like
Drew (Bledsoe),'' said Allen, ``but the run game doesn't get the
attention it needs. Guys stepped up and showed they can run-block,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen said he doesn't feel any wear and tear so far. Asked
whether he could carry the ball 25-30 times a game, he said, ``If
they run-block like Monday, I can go 25-30 carries as long as I can
get through to the secondary guys, and as long as the big guys
don't hit me. As long as we win the game I could care less if we
rush for 1 yard, or for 100, as long as we win.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Story with a twist
</P>
<P>
   Game films seemed to indicate that Denver linebacker Bill
Romanowski was doing the twisting of Ben Coates's left ankle and
knee out of bounds on a pass play. Carroll was coy when asked if he
would file a complaint, but it sounded as if the Patriots would
bring this to the attention of the league. ``This guy's a vicious
football player and great football player,'' said Carroll, ``and if
something happened out of line, the league will take care of it.''
. . . Troy Brown (ankle) will try to practice Wednesday. Carroll
may hold him back so he can have this week and the bye week to
recuperate.

   WASHINGTON _ A Learjet that took off from Orlando, Fla., Monday
morning, carrying the golfer Payne Stewart and apparently five
others, traveled a wayward path across the country for four hours
with no one at the controls and was chased by Air Force planes
before running out of fuel and crashing in a South Dakota swamp.
Everyone on board, including the two pilots, was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators said the pilots appeared to have lost
consciousness or died shortly before they were supposed to turn
west toward Dallas, their intended destination.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic crash ended the career of one of golf's most
recognizable figures, known for his trademark knickers and
tam-o'-shanter hat. Stewart won his first major tournament, the
Professional Golfers' Association championship, in 1989, and
followed it up with a victory in the U.S. Open two years later. But
he went into a slump, and his success tapered off over the next
seven years. In this year's open he outdueled Phil Mickelson and
won with a exciting 15-foot putt on the last hole. It was the
longest putt to ever decide the Open on the final hole.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart had been headed for a tournament in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The twin-engine, high-performance, $2.5 million jet, which can
carry eight passengers, left Orlando at 9:19 a.m. The pilots' last
contact with air traffic controllers was routine, at about 9:45,
when the plane was northwest of Gainsville, Fla. But the pilots
stopped responding to air traffic controllers soon after.
</P>
<P>
   Controllers at the Federal Aviation Administration's
Jacksonville center called the Air Force, which dispatched planes
from Tyndall Air Force Base, near Panama City, in northern Florida;
from Eglin Air Force Base, in the Florida panhandle; and from bases
in Tulsa, Okla., and Fargo, N.D. An Air Force F16 pilot reported
that there was no movement in the cockpit and the plane appeared to
be on autopilot. .
</P>
<P>
   Captain Chris Hamilton, another Air Force pilot, reported that
the windows of the Learjet were fogged, possibly a sign that the
cabin had become so chilled with stratospheric air that the
moisture in the cabin atmosphere had spread itself like dew or
frost on the windows. That may have been from loss of cabin
pressure or from smoke on board, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton said, ``It's a very helpless feeling to pull up
alongside another aircraft and realize the people inside that
aircraft potentially are unconscious or in some other way
incapacitated.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there's nothing I can do physically from my aircraft even
though I'm 50 to 100 feet away, to help them at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a standing Pentagon rule, called ``instructions for
destruction of derelict airborne objects,'' an out-of-control
aircraft can be shot down, with permission from the president, if
it threatens public safety, said Major Michael G. Birmingham of the
U.S. Army, a spokesman for the North American Aerospace Defense
Command, which coordinated the chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds kind of cold but that's what it is,'' said
Birmingham, adding that he did not believe that a plane had ever
been shot down under the policy.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with the FAA and the Pentagon, Air Force
officials considered shooting the plane down, Birmingham said, but
concluded, about an hour and seven minutes before the crash, that
the plane, which was flying northwest, would come down in a
sparsely populated area in South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was informed of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   After the crash, investigators from the National Transportation
Safety Board rushed to the scene but had little hope of retrieving
useful information from the cockpit voice recorder, because it had
a standard tape loop of only 30 minutes, and the incident took over
four hours.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said cabin depressurization was a key suspect in
disabling the pilots, but that it was also possible that smoke or
some other problem was responsible.

MIX AND MATCH FRILLS ON FLIGHTS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 31)

<P>
   Business travelers are learning to love the growing network of
no-frills airlines _ such as EasyJet, Ryanair, Virgin Express and
British Airways' own low-cost clone Go _ that collectively serve
more than 50 destinations in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal is not just their low fares that can save you up to
80 percent on the cost of full-fare tickets, but low one-way fares
that allow you the flexibility you need for traveling midweek.
There is no requirement for a Saturday night stay-over.
</P>
<P>
   No-frills is the fastest-growing sector of the airline industry
in Europe, which, analysts say, could triple in the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
   I can make five round-trips from Nice to London on EasyJet for
the price of one economy (coach) ticket on British Airways, which
carries some restrictions. And even a full house on an EasyJet
737-300 is at least as comfortable, with as much legroom, as on
British Airways.
</P>
<P>
   You pay for snacks and beverages. I buy a pack of smoked-salmon
sandwiches at the airport deli, treat myself to a gin and tonic on
the plane and enjoy. Cost it out.
</P>
<P>
   Business class gets you a separate check-in, the use of an
airport lounge and, usually, a mediocre meal. Increasingly, I can
pay far less for my own airport lounge, my own meals and even my
own limousine if I need one.
</P>
<P>
   Flying in the front of the plane is great, if you can afford it.
First class, however, can cost twice the price of a business-class
fare, which in turn costs up to four times the price of a full
economy ticket and 20 times more than the cheapest excursion
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   It's a stark choice. Do you pay to stretch your ego as well as
your legs? Or save money and endure the exquisite misery of cattle
class?
</P>
<P>
   How you choose to spend your time in the air may depend on your
mode _ office mode, dining mode, relaxation-entertainment mode. On
the red eye out you may want to work; coming home, you may want to
relax or sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, traveling west during the day, when you are going to drop
into bed anyway when you arrive, you might choose to fly economy on
a cheap ticket, especially if you can target an off-peak flight
with an empty seat next to you. Traveling east, you might invest in
a sleeper-seat in business class and forgo dinner.
</P>
<P>
   I've often thought of opening a can of Beluga caviar in economy
class and dining in style. But I've never quite managed to summon
the chutzpah.
</P>
<P>
   But Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts came up with Gourmet Meals
to Go back in 1996 for departing guests ``to replace the limited
options of airline dining.'' The program was started at the Four
Seasons Los Angeles in Beverly Hills in response to ``repeated
requests from guests wanting to take popular dishes with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The service is now available at Four Season properties in Bali,
Dallas, Houston, New York, Newport Beach _ and London. Meals are
packed in ``biodegradable mini-suitcase boxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Caterers and hotels around the world have taken up the idea. The
Dorset Square and the Covent Garden hotels in London provide
takeout breakfasts for early-morning flights. The five-star
Milestone in Kensington, London, offers ``lunch to go'' picnic
boxes, with cutlery and napkins, containing sandwiches of homemade
bread with such fillings as smoked salmon, ham, cheese and pickle;
crudites with cream cheese, fresh herb and onion dip; rotisserie
chicken with tossed salad; fresh fruit salad; banana and pistachio
nut muffin.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, the Canadian airline Wardair offered quality at
reasonable prices with a single standard of cuisine and service
throughout the plane and a Big Seat option. No matter how much your
ticket cost, you could trade up to a Big Seat in the front of the
cabin for around $33. Alas, Wardair, in spite of a loyal following,
was subsumed about 10 years ago by Canadian Airlines. But it's an
idea whose time may have come _ again.
</P>
<P>
   Given the steady move of many business travelers to the back of
the plane, airlines may be starting to realize that they are out of
sync with the reality of travelers' needs. They generally assume
that travelers fall into two groups: those with expense accounts
and leisure travelers. Never mind that some business travelers have
tight budgets and some leisure travelers like to splurge.
</P>
<P>
   Hotels could also offer options a la carte by selling a standard
or ``deluxe'' room and enabling you to pay extra for amenities:
early check-in, late checkout, use of the health club and the
business center.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Eagle Hotel in Hong Kong has just inaugurated an
Executive a la Carte program offering business travelers more
options. Visitors pay $168 for a basic room and then choose from a
range of upgrades at fixed prices. For example, you can have a
``personalized check-in and checkout, breakfast and a room
upgrade,'' for $50 or an upgrade to the Club Floor with buffet
breakfast and cocktails and unlimited laundry and ironing for $70.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Hiring a chauffeur-driven car from a European airport is not as
staggeringly expensive as you might think. Car rental companies
like Hertz, (800) 654-3001, Avis, (800) 331-1084, Budget, (800)
472-3325, or Europcar (44-113) 242 2233, offer a chauffeur service
_ cheaper and more comfortable than a taxi, especially if you are
going to the suburbs, where taxis charge more and may get lost.
</P>
<P>
   You can rent a car by the hour or the day. From Heathrow to the
city, a black cab costs 35 pounds to 45 pounds (about $58 to $117,
at $1.60 to the pound), while a chauffeured ride is $66 to $75 in a
comfortable car. One day of being chauffeured around London, about
five or six hours, is approximately $333, compared with $66 to $75
a day for renting a car and driving yourself.
</P>
<P>
   From London to Oxford, a black cab or minicab will cost $133 to
$166 just to get there, compared with a chauffeur all day for about
$367.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chauffeur drive is most popular in countries where people are
less likely to want to drive themselves _ like Russia, the Middle
East and Africa, where labor costs less,'' said Gareth Wynn at
Hertz in London. ``It becomes less of a luxury and more of a
practical option. In Dubai, for example, you'd pay $77 a day for an
intermediate car plus $45 a day for a chauffeur.''
</P>
<P>
   Budget quotes $34 to $38 an hour for a chauffeured Lincoln Town
Car and $30 an hour for a Ford Mondeo.
</P>
<P>
   Airport lounges are now becoming available to all travelers.
Diners Club offers its cardholders (plus a guest) free use of 84
lounges around the world. All offer free snacks and beverages; some
have a business center; others offer free local calls.
</P>
<P>
   They include four new lounges at Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow
(three in Terminal 1 and one in Terminal 2), plus others at
Prague's Ruzyne Airport and Leonardo da Vinci Airport in Rome. In
Britain, cardholders have the use of three lounges at Heathrow, two
at Manchester and one each at Gatwick, Stansted, Birmingham,
Edinburgh and Glasgow.
</P>
<P>
   The International Airline Passenger Association has a lounge
program, Priority Pass, that allows access to 200 airport lounges
around the world for around $30 a visit (e-mail:
info(AT)prioritypass.co.uk).
</P>
<P>
   Expensive, but what price do you put on a port in a storm?
</P>
<P>
   Lounges in Europe include Amsterdam, Athens, Berlin, Cairo,
Copenhagen, Dublin, London (Gatwick, Heathrow and Stansted),
Frankfurt, Geneva, Milan, Moscow, Nice, Paris, Rome, Vienna and
Zurich.
</P>
<P>
   Delayed in Frankfurt the other day, I headed for the lounge with
a Bloody Mary in mind. Sorry, no vodka, only soft drinks, wine and
beer. The Lufthansa Senator Club lounge next door for first-class
passengers and elite frequent-flier-club members offered the full
treatment for sure.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind. But it goes to show that you cannot yet buy your way
into every sanctum sanctorum.
</P>
<P>
   Wexas International (www.wexas.com), an independent traveler's
club based in London, offers its members access to 55 airport
lounges around the world for $10 to $23 a visit.
</P>
<P>
   United States airlines are required by law to offer club
membership to everyone. American Airlines' Admiral's Club, Delta's
Crown Room Club and United's Red Carpet Club cost around $250 to
join with annual dues of $175 to $200.
</P>
<P>
   Airports and ground-handling agents are starting to offer
lounges to all travelers. BAA, for example, which operates
Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports in London, opened its first
lounge at Stansted in May. The charge is $25, which includes
``unlimited refreshments,'' office facilities with Internet and
e-mail connections, newspapers and a music center.
</P>
<P>
   Customers can also use the FastTrack security channel through
the airport. BAA plans to have similar lounges at all four
terminals at Heathrow by the end of 1999 (www.baa.co.uk).
</P>
<P>
   The first Heathrow lounge in the land side arrival area of
Terminal 3, designed for arriving long-haul passengers, is due to
open in spring 2000. There will be showers, valet facilities, an
English breakfast and business facilities.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what class you fly across the Atlantic, you can arrive
in style.

DEFENSE LAWYER SAYS SUSPECT IN JASPER SLAYING `NOT A RACIST' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Optional ending included) 
 
By RICHARD STEWART 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ The attorney for the third white man to go on
trial for the brutal dragging death of a black man told prospective
jurors Monday that the defendant is ``not a racist'' and has ``no
motive for committing a racial hate crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Berry, 24, of Jasper is charged with capital murder in the
June 7, 1998, slaying of James Byrd Jr., 49, also of Jasper.
Jurors, who will be chosen over the next two weeks, will decide
Berry's guilt or innocence, and if they convict him, will decide
whether he should die or serve a life prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Berry's two co-defendants, 24-year-old Bill King and 32-year-old
Russell Brewer Jr., both white supremacists, have been tried and
sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
   Berry's lawyer hopes to set him apart from King and Brewer.
``Shawn Berry is not a racist, was not a racist, and has no racist
writings, is not a member of any white supremacist group and has no
racial tattoos,'' attorney Joseph ``Lum'' Hawthorn told potential
jurors. ``He has no motive for committing a racial hate crime, and
he did not.''
</P>
<P>
   Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray, who also
prosecuted King and Brewer, said the clean-cut, pale young man who
sat in the courtroom Monday has a more menacing side that will be
presented during the trial. Berry gave investigators seven
different written statements, Gray said, and those statements
conflicted with each other and with a story he recited in an
interview in the television news magazine, ``60 Minutes II.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray has subpoenaed CBS producer Mary Mapes and out-takes of the
interview that were not broadcast. CBS is fighting the subpoena,
but state District Judge Joe Bob Golden ordered Mapes to appear
Friday with the required tapes and said he will hear further
arguments on the issue then.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gray said that forensic evidence indicates Berry may
have been the most active participant in beating Byrd, chaining him
by the ankles to the back of the pickup _ which was owned by Berry
_ and in dragging him to his death.
</P>
<P>
   Previous evidence indicated that Byrd was beaten, his face
spray-painted black and his pants pulled down to his ankles before
he was dragged for almost three miles down a back road outside
Jasper. His torso was ripped apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the fundamental issues in this particular trial is
Shawn Berry's credibility,'' Gray said, ``what he has said compared
to facts and the crime scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry was living in an apartment in Jasper with King, a former
high school friend, in the summer of 1998 when they were joined by
Brewer, 32, a former prison buddy of King's who was visiting from
Sulphur Springs, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Berry admits driving his battered Ford pickup in the early
morning hours of June 7, 1998, when he stopped to give a ride to
Byrd, who was drunk and staggering home on foot from a late-night
party.
</P>
<P>
   In his statements, Berry said he and the others drove Byrd to a
remote forest clearing where the other two men began beating Byrd
and then chained him to the truck and dragged him. Berry claimed in
his first statement that he ran away when the beating started. But
he later changed his story to say he tried to get between Byrd and
his tormentors and in the process got Byrd's blood smeared on him.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said Berry's trial will place heavy emphasis on forensic
evidence and the explanation of blood spatters. Unlike the other
two defendants, Berry has no racial tattoos and no history of being
part of racist organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorn told the jury that ``there are a lot of people who
think I am crazy'' for having the trial in Jasper when he probably
could have had the trial moved. He said Berry helped decide the
keep the case there. ``This crime happened in Jasper County, the
victim was from Jasper, Texas. The defendant is from Jasper,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the day about 170 prospective jurors crowded
into the 110-year-old courtroom. Legal excuses pared that number
down to 132, with 19 blacks among them, by the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   They faced state District Judge Joe Bob Golden, the judge in
King's trial, and one table of prosecutors and another with Berry,
Hawthorn and Berry's fiance, Christie Marcontell, who is serving as
an assistant to Hawthorn. Berry is the first of the three
defendants to pay for his own attorney. The others had
court-appointed lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony should begin about Nov. 9, Golden said, and should
last about eight days.

AMERICAN BALLET THEATER: A CLASSICAL APPROACH TO THE GRAHAM KARMA 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A woman in white stands onstage, a dancer embodying
contained lyricism, and a man falls to her feet or cartwheels for
joy. Splashed like paint on a canvas, another woman in red embodies
passion as she races across in a diagonal. Her youthful counterpart
in yellow springs onto a partner's shoulders. A male and female
ensemble amplifies these images. The work of course is ``Diversion
of Angels,'' Martha Graham's celebrated and luminous ode to love.
</P>
<P>
   American Ballet Theater introduced the work into its repertory
over the weekend. There was a time when the first performance by a
ballet troupe of any Martha Graham choreography, once reserved for
her own company, would have been a milestone. But the karma was
right and natural at the matinees on Saturday and Sunday at City
Center when two Ballet Theater casts initially essayed ``Diversion
of Angels.''
</P>
<P>
   The Martha Graham Dance Company remains the reference point for
the performance of her work, especially after her death in 1991.
But nowadays classical dancers like those in Ballet Theater are
widely exposed to modern dance, and this company premiere was
always true to the essence of ``Diversion of Angels.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not just a case of seeing a Graham signature onstage: the
asymmetrical dislocation of a body on the floor, one foot turned
in, the other stretched and pointed. Nor was it the valiant
attempts of the dancers to execute the contraction and release of
the body that is at the base of Graham's idiom, known as Graham
technique.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, this is a splendid staging by the Graham veteran Takako
Asakawa and a fine introduction to Graham's genius for those
unfamiliar with her work. More specifically, it is her genius for
distilling the deepest of feelings rather than merely depicting
them.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of public television viewers have come into contact
with this idea in a clip of Graham's 1930 ``Lamentation.'' There, a
purple-shrouded figure, her body moving into an assemblage of
planes, is less a woman mourning than an abstract embodiment of
grief; ``the thing itself,'' as Graham called it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diversion of Angels,'' which Graham choreographed for her
company in 1948 to a joyful commissioned score by Norman Dello Joio
(conducted here by Charles Barker), is an extension of this
abstract principle.
</P>
<P>
   There were critics in 1948 who found ``Diversion of Angels'' too
lyrical for Graham and lamented the loss of austerity of her early
pieces and the hard-edged poetry of her Americana works. Yet
``Diversion'' is not lush or sentimental, and the dancers
understood this. A gasp went up from the audience as the curtain
rose on Saturday afternoon. Even to those familiar with Graham, the
clarity of the first image is striking. Against a sky-blue
backdrop, Maxim Belotserkovsky, in a typical archaic profile, stood
protectively behind Gillian Murphy, the woman in white whom he
would soon seem to worship.
</P>
<P>
   The production, approved by Ron Protas, the Graham company's
artistic director, and in which Ms. Asakawa was assisted by Kenneth
Topping, another Graham veteran, is a lesson in form recreating
emotion. The patterns stand out in Brad Fields' lighting, based on
Jean Rosenthal's original design.
</P>
<P>
   Ballet Theater is not the first ballet company to dance a Graham
work. In recent years this has been done by the Dutch National
Ballet and the Paris Opera Ballet, with Protas' permission. The
Colorado Ballet has staged ``Appalachian Spring,'' and it would not
have hurt Ballet Theater's dancers to follow the Colorado example
by taking classes in Graham technique.
</P>
<P>
   The point is that there is a difference between imitating Graham
movement and actually doing it. Ms. Murphy, for instance, looks
right in her purity as the woman in white, but she proved too
classical a dancer to capture the shape of the Graham idiom and was
miscast. On Sunday afternoon, by contrast, Stella Abrera,
concentrated in her long-legged stillness and use of a raised hip,
was perfect in the role.
</P>
<P>
   The big surprise on Saturday was the brilliant performance of a
classical ballerina like Ashley Tuttle as the woman in red: she
went deep into her contraction of the pelvis, with leg raised high,
and caught the momentum of the arm-swinging Graham run as she
rushed across the stage in moments of dramatic epiphany. Similarly,
Yan Chen had the right refined exuberance with Joaquin De Luz in
the right spot to catch her.
</P>
<P>
   Each woman had a duet, and Belotserkovsky and Keith Roberts,
with Miss Tuttle, were supple enough. Sean Stewart rounded out the
male group, and wonderful energy came from all, especially the
women's chorus: Jennifer Alexander, Tamara Barden, Erica Fischbach
and Michele Wiles. The ensemble ``got it'' as well on Sunday
afternoon, with Clinton Luckett and Ilona McHugh, Eleena Melamed,
Adrienne Schulte and Alissa Wassung.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Ms. Abrera, partnered by a stalwart Marcelo Gomes,
this is a slightly less convincing cast. Sandra Brown, usually
excellent in works by other modern dance choreographers (Paul
Taylor, Lar Lubovitch) needed more fluency, and her partner, Ethan
Brown, needed more flexibility. The brother-sister team of Erica
Cornejo and Herman Cornejo had the spirit of the ``yellow'' duet.
In all, a fine addition to the repertory, something more than an
experiment.

WAYNE E. OATES, WHO COINED THE TERM `WORKAHOLIC,' DIES AT 82  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky., S.C., N.C.)   By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wayne E. Oates, the tireless writer of 57 books dealing with the
relationship between theology and psychiatry, and the man who
thought up the word ``workaholic,'' died on Thursday at a
Louisville hospital. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, Oates wrote ``Confessions of a Workaholic: The Facts
about Work Addiction,'' adding a word to the American lexicon; the
Oxford English Dictionary credits him with inventing it.
</P>
<P>
   His concept was that work can become an addiction, akin to
alcoholism. Oates said in an interview at the time the book was
published that the work addict ``drops out of the human community''
in a drive for peak performance.
</P>
<P>
   Oates' interest perhaps reflected an appreciation of his own
personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was just an absolute, bustling dynamo of energy,''
said his son, Dr. Charles E. Oates, a neurologist. Other survivors
of the senior Oates are his wife, Pauline, and a grandson.
</P>
<P>
   Oates devoted much of his time to combining Christian theology
with psychiatric insights to improve pastoral counseling. He had
retired as professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the
University of Louisville School of Medicine and at other schools in
the South after serving in several academic and pastoral posts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the fathers of the psychiatry of religion,''
said Dr. James Hyde, an associate professor of psychiatry at the
Louisville medical school.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said Oates built a bridge between religion and psychiatry
in the 1940s and 1950s when a chasm separated the approaches to
human problems. For example, Oates strove to help people who would
try to pluck their own eyeballs out in accordance with what he
argued was a misguided literal interpretation of a scriptural
passage that reads in the Book of Matthew, ``And if thine eye
offend thee, pluck it out.''
</P>
<P>
   His first book was ``The Christian Pastor,'' which was published
in 1951 and is now in its third edition. His other books dealt with
subjects ranging from grief to alcoholism to premarital counseling.
</P>
<P>
   As suggested by one title, ``When Religion Gets Sick'' (1971),
Oates did not shrink from controversy. When his second book, ``The
Bible in Pastoral Care,'' was published, five professors went to
the president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in
Louisville to object.
</P>
<P>
   ``They complained that I didn't have any right to write on the
Bible,'' Oates told The Louisville Courier-Journal in an interview
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the seminary, Duke McCall, told the professors
that they should write their own books about the Bible instead of
criticizing Oates.
</P>
<P>
   Oates was born in Greenville, S.C., in 1917. He graduated from
Mars Hill College and received his master's degree in theology from
Wake Forest University. He earned his doctorate at the Louisville
seminary, where he wrote his thesis on Sigmund Freud. He taught at
the seminary and the University of Louisville while writing
profusely, mainly on pastoral counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Oates said he never published his thesis because of concern that
he would be labeled a Freudian. In fact, he said his purpose was to
provide a critique of Freud and those who blindly subscribed to his
theories.
</P>
<P>
   The limits of the psychological approach _ as well as its
possibilities _ remained a concern to him.
</P>
<P>
   Associates and relatives noted that one of Oates' core beliefs
was that even questionable motives could be channeled in useful
directions. For example, they pointed to his second look at
workaholics. The title of this 1978 book: ``Workaholics: Make
Laziness Work for You.''

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
NEW YORK _ Two hits in 14 innings.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That's all the Atlanta Braves have been able to muster against
the New York Yankees' starting pitchers in the first two games of
this World Series, and that is why the Braves are a Texas two-step
from elimination.
</P>
<P>
   Step one could come tonight when Andy Pettitte tries to extend
the Yankees' trend of throwing goose eggs at the Braves with the
synchronicity of a line dance.
</P>
<P>
   And the pace will be even faster in Game 4 when Roger Clemens
takes the mound in what could be the Braves' last dance if they
don't find a way to wake their dormant offense.
</P>
<P>
   It does not bode well for the Braves that the Yankees' fourth
starter, Clemens, stood side by side with Bob Gibson, Sandy Koufax,
Nolan Ryan and Warren Spahn during a ceremony to announce the
All-Century Team prior to Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fourth starter is one of the best pitchers of the
century,'' Yankees lefthander Allen Watson said. ``What do you
think that says about our rotation?''
</P>
<P>
   It says the Braves are in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   It also says the Yankees' rotation may have been unfairly
overlooked in this Series, which is the case for the opponent any
time the Braves and their Fab Four starters _ Greg Maddux, Tom
Glavine, John Smoltz and Kevin Millwood _ are involved.
</P>
<P>
   After Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez and David Cone outpitched
Maddux and Millwood in the first two games of the Series, it
appears the Yankees' rotation doesn't have to take a back seat to
any in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our starting pitching isn't as good as someone else's, I
want to find that team,'' Yankees designated hitter Chili Davis
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching is the main reason the Yankees have won nine of 10
games this postseason. They have compiled a 2.33 ERA in the
playoffs and have held opponents to an average of just 1.3 runs a
game if you exclude the 13-run aberration against the Red Sox in
Game 3 of the American League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves were 0-for-22 with men on base before scoring two
runs off the Yankees' bullpen in the ninth inning Sunday. Atlanta
has scored three runs total in the first two games of the World
Series; it's no wonder the Yankees are threatening to sweep the
Series for the second year in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won two games, and we're halfway there, but we have a ways
to go,'' Yankees right fielder Paul O'Neill said. ``Our pitching is
setting it up. It's fun to play behind our guys when they throw the
ball that well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves used to know that feeling. But that was before their
offense abandoned the pitching at the most inopportune time. The
Braves are hitting .238 in this postseason, averaging 3.3 runs
since the end of the Division Series and just 2.4 if you exclude
the 10 runs they scored against the Mets in Game 6 of the National
League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   Braves manager Bobby Cox put his team through extra batting
practice Monday at Yankee Stadium, and there was even talk of a
special hitters meeting. But hitting instructor Don Baylor
indicated now was the time for action, not talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have all the rah-rah in the world, but it's not going
to happen if you don't do it on the field and have the right
approach,'' Baylor said. ``I think our guys are pressing and being
impatient.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's time to consider the possibility that the Braves'
lineup isn't that good.
</P>
<P>
   Leadoff man Gerald Williams was projected as a fourth outfielder
when the season began. Second baseman Bret Boone has been
inconsistent offensively for most of his career. Shortstop Walt
Weiss was so inept at the plate, he hardly saw the field during the
second half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that the fact that Andres Galarraga and Javy Lopez are
watching helplessly because of illness or injury, and there are a
lot of relatively easy outs in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   The only dangerous hitters are Brian Jordan and Chipper Jones,
whom teams have refused to let beat them during the postseason.
Jones has walked 17 times in 12 playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've said it before,'' Baylor said. ``If they're not going to
pitch to Chipper, someone else is going to have to step up and make
them pay.''
</P>
<P>
   One could argue the Braves' best chance of winning will be in
the next two days, simply because Pettitte and Clemens didn't pitch
up to their standards this season.
</P>
<P>
   But both can be dominant, particularly Clemens, whose five Cy
Young Awards make him the most decorated pitcher in this series.
Although Clemens hasn't been himself this season, facing him in a
possible elimination game is hardly a pleasant thought for the
Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte won't be a pushover, either. He is 2-0 with a 1.84 ERA
this postseason, surrendering just one walk in 15 innings. Glavine,
who was scheduled to start Game 1 for the Braves, will make his
1999 World Series debut tonight after battling flu symptoms the
past few days.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Glavine estimated his readiness at about 85 percent.
If the first two games of the Series are any indication, nothing
less than his best will be enough to match the Yankees' mound men.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John Hubbard Chafee of Rhode Island, the last
of the Rockefeller Republicans and an increasingly isolated voice
of internationalism and bipartisanship in his party, died on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Chafee died of heart failure at the National Naval Medical
Center in Bethesda, Md., a Washington suburb, his office announced.
He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   His major domestic efforts involved the environment and health
policy, and he was responsible for a vast expansion of Medicaid,
the federal health program for the poor, in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   A Marine veteran of Guadalcanal and the Korean War, Chafee made
his last major effort in the Senate this month in seeking to
postpone a vote on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. When the
Senate went ahead and voted on the pact that would have banned
underground nuclear testing, he was one of four Republicans to
support ratification.
</P>
<P>
   In his final Senate speech, on Oct. 13, he said, ``We signed
this treaty recognizing that discouraging other nuclear powers and
would-be nuclear powers from testing these weapons would lessen the
unthinkable possibility that the nuclear option would ever be
employed.'' Far from threatening American security, he said, the
treaty ``locks in a status quo in which the United States has an
enormous advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   In partisan terms, his death will not change the Senate's 55-45
Republican advantage. Lincoln Almond, Rhode Island's Republican
governor and a Chafee protege, will appoint a successor to serve
until Jan. 3, 2001. Among the early favorites is Lincoln Chafee,
the senator's son, who is mayor of Warwick. Lincoln Chafee already
was a candidate for his father's seat after the elder Chafee
announced on March 15 that he would retire when this term ended.
</P>
<P>
   The most immediate impact in the Senate could be on
environmental issues. Chafee, as chairman of the Committee on
Environment and Public Works, has bottled up a number of
pro-business changes in environmental laws that other Republicans
want. Sen. Robert Smith of New Hampshire, who announced this year
that he was leaving the Republican Party but who still enjoys its
seniority, is next in line for the chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, said
on Monday that it was ``premature for any kind of discussion'' of
the chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
   In a larger sense, Chafee's death leaves the Senate with only
two relatively moderate Republicans in positions of power. Sen.
John Warner of Virginia is chairman of the Armed Services
Committee, and Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana heads the Agriculture
Committee. But neither has been as eager as Chafee to work with
Democrats or as ready to cross the Republican leadership.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years the Senate has lost a significant group of
Republicans who found it natural to seek bipartisan alliances, from
Mark Hatfield of Oregon, to Alan Simpson of Wyoming, to John
Danforth of Missouri, to Nancy Kassebaum Baker of Kansas, to Hank
Brown of Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Monday that talent, exemplified by Chafee, was cheered chiefly
by Democrats. Sen. John Breaux of Louisiana, a frequent
collaborator on issues including health care and welfare reform,
said: ``We lost one who was part of our centrist coalition, and the
country has lost someone who was always putting his country ahead
of party politics. He was part of a group that should be growing in
numbers, not diminishing, but we become more polarized each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate and this country have lost a leader who put his
country's interests before partisan politics.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who had hoped in vain for Chafee's help on
national health insurance in 1993 and 1994, said on Monday: ``Rhode
Island and America have lost a great leader and a fine human being,
who in 23 years in the Senate and in his service as secretary of
the Navy, always put his concern for the American people above
partisanship. When you think of the term `bipartisan,' you
immediately think of John Chafee.''
</P>
<P>
   And while some Republican conservatives have sniped at Chafee
over the years, and even dumped him from the chairmanship of their
party conference in 1990, their reactions on Monday were warm.
</P>
<P>
   Senators were visibly upset as they spoke and after they left
the floor. One whose voice broke with emotion was Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., declined to speak to a reporter
about a national security budget matter, saying he had just
finished giving a Chafee tribute.
</P>
<P>
   Chafee was descended from one of the ``five families'' of Rhode
Island, Yankees who ran the state before immigrants changed its
political complexion in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   He was at Yale when World War II began and he enlisted in the
Marines, serving in battles at Guadalcanal and Okinawa, and was
commissioned as a second lieutenant. He returned to Yale and then
went to Harvard Law School before being recalled to active duty in
Korea in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   He practiced law and served six years in the Rhode Island
Legislature, becoming minority leader of the state Assembly. In
1962 he became only the third Republican elected governor in 30
years, squeaking through by 398 votes.
</P>
<P>
   He was an unabashedly liberal governor. He pushed for
anti-discrimination laws in housing and employment before the
federal government passed them. He advocated the construction of
Interstate 95, developed parks throughout the small state and
pushed through a state plan of health care for the elderly before
Congress enacted Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In presidential politics, Chafee opposed Barry Goldwater's bid
for the 1964 Republican nomination, and in 1968 he backed Gov.
Nelson Rockefeller of New York against Richard Nixon and Ronald
Reagan. While Rockefeller got all 14 of Rhode Island's delegate
votes, it was not nearly enough.
</P>
<P>
   Chafee himself was victim of a political upset that fall, losing
a bid for a fourth term as governor to Frank Licht. Chafee had
halted his campaigning after his 14-year-old daughter, Tribbie, had
died a few weeks before the election after being kicked in the head
by a horse.
</P>
<P>
   But despite his support for Rockefeller, the Nixon
administration found a place for him, and he reveled in the post of
Navy secretary. His most striking decision was made on May 6, 1969,
when he blocked any court martial of the commander and the
intelligence officer of the U.S.S. Pueblo, which had been captured
by North Korea in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   They had been held prisoner for 11 months, and Chafee said,
``They have suffered enough.'' Moreover, he concluded that the
capture was the result of a failure shared by the entire Navy chain
of command.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major factor which led to the Pueblo's only confrontation
by unanticipated bold and hostile forces was the sudden collapse of
a premise which had been assumed at every level of responsibility
and upon which every other aspect of the mission had been based _
freedom of the high seas,'' he wrote. ``The consequences must in
fairness be borne by all, rather than by one or two individuals
whom circumstances had placed closer to the actual event.''
</P>
<P>
   He resigned in 1972 and ran for the Senate against Claiborne
Pell. But in a strongly Democratic state, he lost despite Nixon's
landslide. After that Chafee returned to practicing law in
Providence, until he ran again for the Senate in 1976 and won.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate he joined in 1977 was a far less partisan institution
than today's, and he could support President Jimmy Carter and the
Panama Canal treaty without repercussions from his Republican
colleagues. And when Ronald Reagan was elected in 1980, Chafee
eagerly proclaimed it a Republican victory, not a conservative one,
and promised moderate support on issues like the economy.
</P>
<P>
   But he also moved forward with his own priorities. Year after
year in the 1980s, as Congress cut the budget for other social
programs, he engineered expansions of Medicaid, extending coverage
to millions of pregnant women and children.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the changes altered a basic concept of Medicaid,
breaking the link that for more than two decades had tied Medicaid
eligibility to the receipt of cash welfare benefits. As a result of
his efforts, Congress allowed, and in some cases required, states
to help pay medical bills for certain low-income people who were
not receiving welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Chafee helped write a provision of the 1996 welfare law intended
to guarantee continued Medicaid coverage for families losing cash
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George
Washington University, said: ``Senator Chafee was involved in
virtually every important change in the Medicaid program since the
late 1970s. He led efforts to expand maternal and child health
programs. He had an undying commitment to Medicaid recipients with
disabilities. He made great efforts to preserve and strengthen the
health care safety net, assuring adequate payments for community
health centers that care for huge numbers of uninsured patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite fighting the Reagan administration over military
spending, he was elected to the Senate Republicans' third-ranking
position, chairman of the Republican Conference, in 1984. He was
ousted from that position in 1990 by the more conservative Thad
Cochran of Mississippi, who in turn was pushed aside by more
conservative rivals.
</P>
<P>
   But that year, he also played a central role in reauthorizing
the Clean Air Act, one of the nation's landmark environmental laws.
That was only one of the achievements hailed by environmentalists
on Monday. Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club, cited
that bill and also said Chafee played an even greater role later as
a ``one-man front line'' defending laws against the ``Republican
far-right wing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one will ever know how many bad things did not happen in
the last three years because John Chafee was there,'' Pope said. At
least one of Pope's evils was easy to identify. When Republicans
recaptured the Senate in 1995, Chafee became chairman of the
Environment Committee. He showed a chairman's power when he simply
refused to bring up a rewritten version of the landmark Clean Water
Act of 1972. The House-passed measure would have weakened or
revoked a number of pollution control requirements.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, despite the loss of his formal Republican Party
leadership position, his friend, Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, put him
in charge of a task force to define Republican policy on national
health insurance. The Chafee group rejected the idea of requiring
employers to buy coverage for their workers, which was central to
Clinton's plan, but instead advocated requiring people to get
insurance, with federal subsidies for those who could not afford
it.
</P>
<P>
   As the issue heated up in 1993 and 1994, Dole backed away from
it. When Chafee, Breaux and others struggled, in dozens of meetings
in a Capitol hideaway, to compromise with the Clinton plan, they
could get no more than a handful of Republicans who would vote to
break the Dole filibuster. Their effort, like Clinton's, foundered.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, a central ally in that cause and a frequent dinner
companion during late Senate nights, reflected Monday that one of
the best things about Chafee at that moment was that ``when it fell
apart, there was no bitterness.'' Danforth added: ``He was a person
who really wanted to make things better.''
</P>
<P>
   And while the big effort failed, elements of the Chafee-Breaux
``Mainstream Coalition'' plan reappeared in law in later years, and
Chafee played a major role in getting a plan to insure more
children _ though it was initiated by Sens. Edward Kennedy,
D-Mass., and Orrin Hatch, R-Utah _ enacted in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But while Chafee clashed often with the increasingly
conservative Republican Senate leadership, he was hardly
predictable. Among his last votes was opposition to an effort to
cut off debate on campaign finance legislation last week. He said
the bill had been weakened too much to bother with.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Virginia; four sons, John Chafee Jr.
of Los Angeles, Lincoln Chafee of Warwick, R.I., Quentin Chafee of
North Kingstown, R.I., and Zechariah Chafee of Providence, R.I.; a
daughter, Georgia Nassikas of McLean, R.I.; three sisters, Janet
Cushman of Quebec, Susan Welch of Bethany, Conn., and Alexandra
Reynolds of North Kingstown, and 12 grandchildren.

 WASHINGTON: was responsible.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The plane was equipped, as airliners are, with a red light and a
horn, which pilots cannot turn off, to warn when the atmospheric
pressure inside the cabin is equal to the pressure outside at
10,000 feet. If the pressure in the cabin reaches the pressure
outside at 14,000 feet, oxygen masks for the passengers are
supposed to drop automatically.
</P>
<P>
   One air safety investigator who is not directly involved in this
crash said that depressurization ``could be very insidious.'' He
explained that the problem could slowly deprive the crew of its
ability to know what was happening. ``It could be one of those
things where you're feeling good, you're feeling happy, and you
don't know what's going on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some planes have suffered ``explosive decompression,'' or sudden
loss of pressure, but the initial impression of experts was that
this did not happen on Monday because the plane continued to fly
for hours with no apparent structural damage, which would be
expected with a sudden loss of pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA was unable to say Monday precisely when it had concluded
that the pilots had stopped responding, but at 10:08 a.m. ET,
planes were sent from Tyndall Air Force Base. At 10:22, an F16 and
an A-10 from Eglin, already in flight, were diverted to catch the
Learjet, but only the F-16 made it.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, who was flying the F-16, broke off a half hour later
to land at Scott Air Force Base, near St. Louis, for lack of fuel,
and four F-16s from the Oklahoma Air National Guard, on a training
mission over Kansas, gave chase but never caught up. Later, F-16s
from Fargo, N.D, found the Lear and watched it spiral through the
clouds, probably because one of its two engines had run out of
fuel, and crash.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian interceptors were waiting on their side of the border
in case the plane made it that far, Birmingham said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, a Lear 35 built in 1976, was operated by Sun Jet
Aviation, of Sanford, Fla., near Orlando. It had been cleared to
39,000 feet by controllers in Jacksonville, according to James E.
Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, who
said it had reached 37,000 feet at the time of the last contact
with the crew, at 9:44.
</P>
<P>
   The Lear carried an autopilot system that could keep the nose
pointed at a constant compass heading and could maintain an
altitude or a rate of climb. It may have been set to maintain a
rate of climb but stopped at 45,000 feet, the maximum altitude the
model can reach.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout its flight, whether the crew was incapacitated or
dead, the plane itself continued to function. A transponder, or
radio beacon, continued to broadcast the plane's identity and
altitude as it was interrogated by FAA radars en route.
</P>
<P>
   Accidents in which pilots are disabled or killed in planes that
then fly for hours on autopilot are rare but not unprecedented. In
January 1997 the pilot of a four-seat Piper Dakota took off from
Long Island and was overcome by carbon monoxide leaking in through
the heating system; as his 71-year-old mother took the controls and
radioed for help, a flight instructor in an interceptor plane
rushed to her assistance. But the mother, too, was overcome with
the gas, and the plane flew to northern New Hampshire, where it
crashed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980 an earlier model Lear had a similar accident, flying
from Shreveport, La., into the Atlantic off Virginia, also
apparently on autopilot. The plane carried Bo Rein, the Louisiana
State University football coach.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas A. Williams, a commercial pilot with 7,000 hours of
experience in Learjets, said that if the altitude warning system
went off, the proper procedure was to contact air traffic
controllers and drop to 10,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   A pressure loss could have been too gradual for the crew to
notice, he said, ``but I can't imagine the airplane's warning
system not working.''

MARKET PLACE: THE CHANGING WORLD OF OPTIONS TRADING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bringing increased competition and fairer trading to
the world of equity options is, it seems, easier said than done.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the Securities
and Exchange Commission, has repeatedly called on the nation's
option exchanges to reduce investors' trading costs by opening
their markets to more competition and linking the various exchanges
electronically. Because of Levitt's jawboning, most equity options
are now traded on more than one exchange. Until recently, most of
them were traded exclusively on either the Chicago Board Options
Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the Pacific Stock Exchange
or the Philadelphia Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   But multiple listing of these securities has reduced profits
significantly for the major Wall Street firms that trade them. As a
result, some firms are casting about for ways to retrieve lost
profits. And some of the practices that the major firms are
exploring may not be in the best interest of investors and may in
fact fragment the market rather than centralize it.
</P>
<P>
   Among the recent developments in the options trading arena are
specialist firms offering payments to other brokerage firms for
their customers' orders. Although this practice, known as payment
for order flow, has been a fact of life in the stock market for
years, it is new in options. Payment for order flow, while legal,
is of concern to regulators, though they have done little to stop
it in the stock markets. By paying for a stream of orders, a firm
has an incentive to match up buy and sell orders internally and
pocket the difference, instead of displaying orders across the
entire market. If more investors see an order, its chance for a
better execution improves.
</P>
<P>
   Big brokerage firms are also exploring alliances with options
exchanges in which the firms could become specialists on the
exchange and funnel all their customers' orders essentially to
themselves. This is known as internalizing or preferencing trades,
and it too can hurt investors whose orders do not get a chance to
interact with the overall market.
</P>
<P>
   Both developments are indicative of the rapidly shifting terrain
in the securities markets in which firms are grabbing market share
wherever they can, however they can. The evolving options practices
are of deep concern to the SEC because they go against the
regulators' goal of increased competition in the options markets.
Annette Nazareth, director of market regulation at the commission,
said, ``Our concern is whether vigorous quote competition, and
therefore better pricing, is compromised when these practices
exist.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Levitt plans to address some issues in the options markets in a
speech before the Securities Industry Association next week.
</P>
<P>
   Options are an increasingly popular investment device that give
the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a set
amount of a particular security at a specified price.
Alternatively, sellers of equity options are obligated to buy or
sell a specified amount of shares at a set price.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers of investors trading equity options has risen
sharply in recent years. This year, an average of 1.86 million
option contracts have exchanged hands each day, up from 450,000 on
average in 1990. Options are traded on approximately 3,000 stocks
and on stock indexes such as the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four exchanges, the Chicago Board Options Exchange has
the most trading volume. Through September, the CBOE did 45.3
percent of all equity options trades, compared with 28.2 percent at
the American Stock Exchange, 17.1 percent at the Pacific Stock
Exchange and 9.3 percent at the Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Options can be perilous to trade because there are fewer
safeguards to protect investors from getting bad prices on their
orders. For example, the major stock exchanges have order-handling
rules, requiring dealers to execute their customers' trades at the
best price available in the market and forbidding dealers from
trading for themselves before their customers at a given price.
Options markets have no such rules. As a result, one options
exchange executive conceded that option orders are given the proper
priority only half the time.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt's call last week for an electronic link of the options
markets would eliminate much of this disparity as prices on all the
exchanges would be displayed simultaneously. He has asked for new
proposals from the major exchanges in three months.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, with the bulk of options trading on more than
one exchange, the difference between what an investor pays to buy
and what he receives when he sells _ known as the spread _ has
shrunk. The spread in Intel options, for example, has dropped from
12.5 cents a contract to half that amount since multiple listing
began, according to a trader on the American Stock Exchange.
Because much of the spread is pocketed by the dealers, the profits
in the business are way down.
</P>
<P>
   Susquehanna Partners, in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., is one of the largest
options specialist firms in the United States, trading 460
different options. It has recently begun offering to pay other
brokerage firms to send their customers' options orders to it.
Another large specialist firm said to be pursuing such deals is
Spear, Leeds &AMP; Kellogg; Carl Hewitt, a spokesman for the firm,
declined to comment. Payments for order flow can begin without
regulatory approval.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Noll, associate director at Susquehanna, confirmed that the
firm was holding discussions with other brokerage firms about
buying their orders, but declined to discuss the arrangements.
According to an exchange official, the firm has offered to buy
orders in return for 5 percent of the profit on the business. At
least one unnamed discount brokerage firm was said to have signed
on.
</P>
<P>
   Noll stressed that paying for orders would not keep Susquehanna
from delivering the best execution on all its customers' trades.
And he pointed out that exchange rules prevent options specialists
generally from executing more than 20 percent of total volume in an
option, encouraging competition.
</P>
<P>
   If a firm attracts most of the orders in a contract, though, it
can essentially become the market, reducing competition. The order
would be executed at the current market price but would not get a
chance to receive a better price, known as price improvement in the
securities markets.
</P>
<P>
   A similar problem is presented when brokerage firms become
option specialists and try to internalize their customers' orders.
In such a case, the order is matched with other orders inside the
firm and not shown to the larger market.
</P>
<P>
   As the regulator of the options exchanges, the SEC could reject
such arrangements. Ms. Nazareth said: ``We are aware that some of
the options exchanges have been approached by members to permit
them to direct all their orders to their own specialists. We have
concerns about these proposals, and we would look very carefully at
the impact on the options markets before we permitted these
practices to occur.''

BARBARA WOLFF CITY OFFICIAL ACTIVE IN NEW YORK DEVELOPMENT, DIES AT
58  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass., Switzerland)   By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Barbara Wolff, a veteran New York City official who
was instrumental in setting up the city's business improvement
districts program and in the commercial revitalization program that
followed the blackout of 1977, died Oct. 15 at her home in
Manhattan. She was 58.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was ovarian cancer, said George Glatter, a friend and
colleague, who said Ms. Wolff had kept coming to her office until
several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wolff was assistant commissioner in charge of the
neighborhood development division of the New York City Department
of Business Services, a job she had held for more than a decade.
The division develops and oversees economic programs designed to
benefit neighborhood commercial streets, industrial areas and other
economic centers in the city.
</P>
<P>
   In that post and for some years earlier she played a leading
role in creating the business improvement districts known as BID's,
which now number more than 40. They are self-financing
organizations directed by local property owners and businesses. The
districts offer a variety of services, including sanitation,
security, promotion and marketing. The services are tailored to
each district's needs and supplement the services the city
provides.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest districts include those for Grand Central and Times
Square areas. The smallest are strips of commercial establishments
in neighborhoods like the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn and
the Steinway Street area of Queens.
</P>
<P>
   The program has been credited with strengthening many commercial
areas and some industrial ones by helping attract new businesses
and persuading others to stay.
</P>
<P>
   From 1977 to 1983, Ms. Wolff was with the city's Office for
Economic Development as its director of commercial revitalization.
Glatter, a deputy assistant commissioner in the business services
department, said Ms. Wolff had directed the program, begun as a
response to the damage inflicted on stores around the city in the
looting that took place during the 1977 blackout.
</P>
<P>
   The program has made use of federal and city funds over the
years to provide various kinds of aid to local businesses and
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wolff was born in Manhattan and graduated from Hunter High
School. She received a bachelor's degree from Simmons College in
Boston and a master's degree in political science from the
University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   She also worked for the International Labor Organization in
Geneva, the U. S. Agency for International Development in
Washington, the Parks and City Planning departments in New York and
the City's Public Development Corp., where she was a vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by a brother, William Wolff of Los Angeles.

 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John Hubbard Chafee of Rhode Island, the last
of the Rockefeller Republicans and an increasingly isolated voice
of internationalism and bipartisanship in his party, died on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Chafee died of heart failure at the National Naval Medical
Center in Bethesda, Md., a Washington suburb, his office announced.
He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   His major domestic efforts involved the environment and health
policy, and he was responsible for a vast expansion of Medicaid,
the federal health program for the poor, in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   A Marine veteran of Guadalcanal and the Korean War, Chafee made
his last major effort in the Senate this month in seeking to
postpone a vote on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. When the
Senate went ahead and voted on the pact that would have banned
underground nuclear testing, he was one of four Republicans to
support ratification.
</P>
<P>
   In partisan terms, his death will not change the Senate's 55-45
Republican advantage. Lincoln Almond, Rhode Island's Republican
governor and a Chafee protege, will appoint a successor to serve
until Jan. 3, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The most immediate impact in the Senate could be on
environmental issues. Chafee, as chairman of the Committee on
Environment and Public Works, has bottled up a number of
pro-business changes in environmental laws that other Republicans
want.
</P>
<P>
   In a larger sense, Chafee's death deprives the Senate of a
relatively moderate Republican in a position of power who was eager
to work with Democrats and willing to cross the Republican
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who had hoped in vain for Chafee's help on
national health insurance in 1993 and 1994, said on Monday: ``Rhode
Island and America have lost a great leader and a fine human being,
who in 23 years in the Senate and in his service as secretary of
the Navy, always put his concern for the American people above
partisanship. When you think of the term `bipartisan,' you
immediately think of John Chafee.''
</P>
<P>
   Chafee was descended from one of the ``five families'' of Rhode
Island, Yankees who ran the state before immigrants changed its
political complexion in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   He was at Yale when World War II began and he enlisted in the
Marines, serving in battles at Guadalcanal and Okinawa, and was
commissioned as a second lieutenant. He returned to Yale and then
went to Harvard Law School before being recalled to active duty in
Korea in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   He practiced law and served six years in the Rhode Island
Legislature, becoming minority leader of the State Assembly. In
1962 he became only the third Republican elected governor in 30
years, squeaking through by 398 votes.
</P>
<P>
   He was an unabashedly liberal governor. He pushed for
anti-discrimination laws in housing and employment before the
federal government passed them. He advocated the construction of
Interstate 95, developed parks throughout the small state and
pushed through a state plan of health care for the elderly before
Congress enacted Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   In presidential politics, Chafee opposed Barry Goldwater's bid
for the 1964 Republican nomination, and in 1968 he backed Gov.
Nelson Rockefeller of New York against Richard Nixon and Ronald
Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Chafee himself was victim of a political upset that fall, losing
a bid for a fourth term as governor to Frank Licht. Chafee had
halted his campaigning after his 14-year-old daughter, Tribbie, had
died a few weeks before the election after being kicked in the head
by a horse.
</P>
<P>
   But despite his support for Rockefeller, the Nixon
administration found a place for him, and he reveled in the post of
Navy secretary. His most striking decision was made on May 6, 1969,
when he blocked any court martial of the commander and the
intelligence officer of the U.S.S. Pueblo, which had been captured
by North Korea in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   They had been held prisoner for 11 months, and Chafee said,
``They have suffered enough.'' Moreover, he concluded that the
capture was the result of a failure shared by the entire Navy chain
of command.
</P>
<P>
   He resigned in 1972 and ran for the Senate against Claiborne
Pell. But in a strongly Democratic state, he lost despite Nixon's
landslide. After that Chafee returned to practicing law in
Providence, until he ran again for the Senate in 1976 and won.
</P>
<P>
   Year after year in the 1980s, as Congress cut the budget for
other social programs, Chafee engineered expansions of Medicaid,
extending coverage to millions of pregnant women and children.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the changes altered a basic concept of Medicaid,
breaking the link that for more than two decades had tied Medicaid
eligibility to the receipt of cash welfare benefits. As a result of
his efforts, Congress allowed, and in some cases required, states
to help pay medical bills for certain low-income people who were
not receiving welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Despite fighting the Reagan administration over military
spending, he was elected to the Senate Republicans' third-ranking
position, chairman of the Republican Conference, in 1984. He was
ousted from that position in 1990 by the more conservative Thad
Cochran of Mississippi, who in turn was pushed aside by more
conservative rivals.
</P>
<P>
   But that year, he also played a central role in reauthorizing
the Clean Air Act, one of the nation's landmark environmental laws.
That was only one of the achievements hailed by environmentalists
on Monday. Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club, cited
that bill and also said Chafee played an even greater role later as
a ``one-man front line'' defending laws against the ``Republican
far-right wing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, despite the loss of his formal Republican Party
leadership position, his friend, Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, put him
in charge of a task force to define Republican policy on national
health insurance. The Chafee group rejected the idea of requiring
employers to buy coverage for their workers, which was central to
President Clinton's plan, but instead advocated requiring people to
get insurance, with federal subsidies for those who could not
afford it.
</P>
<P>
   As the issue heated up in 1993 and 1994, Dole backed away from
it. When Chafee, Sen. John Breaux, D-La., and others struggled in
dozens of meetings in a Capitol hideaway to compromise with the
Clinton plan, they could get no more than a handful of Republicans
who would vote to break the Dole filibuster. Their effort, like
Clinton's, foundered.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. John Danforth of Missouri, a central ally in that
cause and a frequent dinner companion during late Senate nights,
reflected Monday that one of the best things about Chafee at that
moment was that ``when it fell apart, there was no bitterness.''
Danforth added: ``He was a person who really wanted to make things
better.''
</P>
<P>
   And while the big effort failed, elements of the Chafee-Breaux
``Mainstream Coalition'' plan reappeared in law in later years, and
Chafee played a major role in getting a plan to insure more
children enacted in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Virginia; four sons, John Chafee Jr.
of Los Angeles, Lincoln Chafee of Warwick, R.I., Quentin Chafee of
North Kingstown, R.I., and Zechariah Chafee of Providence, R.I.; a
daughter, Georgia Nassikas of McLean, R.I.; three sisters, Janet
Cushman of Quebec, Susan Welch of Bethany, Conn., and Alexandra
Reynolds of North Kingstown, and 12 grandchildren.

CEO: NO OFFER MADE TO BUY SOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Red Sox CEO John Harrington says that neither Harold
Alfond nor anyone else is in line to buy the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington spoke out in response to a story making the rounds in
Boston on Monday that Alfond, the 83-year-old former owner of
Dexter Shoe Co. and a Red Sox limited partner, had made a serious
offer to purchase the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was with Harold last Friday night and he never said a word
about any offer,'' Harrington said. ``And I think he would have
said something if he was going to make an offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington added that the Red Sox cannot be sold to anyone
without following a prescribed path.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing we would have to do is get the approval of the
commissioner (Bud Selig) to even talk to anyone seriously about
bidding for the club,'' he said. ``That person, or persons, would
have to be cleared by the commissioner's office first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any sale of this team has to follow a process. First, approval
by the commissioner. And then second, a private auction. We have a
fiduciary responsibility to Yawkey Trust to get the greatest value
we possibly can for the team and all of its assets. Because when
this team is sold, most of the money will go to the Yawkey Trust,
and in turn be given to charity.
</P>
<P>
   ``For more than a few years, I've had over 30 different people
and groups contact me about buying the club. I told them all the
same thing. When the time comes, they will be contacted about the
sale. Right now, there is nothing going on, and I don't see
anything happening in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone came to us tomorrow and said, `We will give you
$500 million right now,' then we would have to do something. But
that hasn't happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Powell, the attorney for Alfond, says there is no truth
whatsoever to the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any idea of how this happened, but there is
nothing to it,'' said Powell. ``Mr. Alfond thinks the world of John
Harrington and what he is doing with the team. There is no story
here.''

 _ SF CHRON   401(k) After Divorce, Death 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Q: As part of my wife's divorce settlement from her first husband,
an airline pilot, she was given rights to half the retirement
benefits he accumulated during their marriage, all of which were in
a 401(k) plan. Sadly, he was killed in a plane crash before
retiring. The airline has rolled over my wife's portion of the
retirement benefits into a new 401(k) account, which it
administers. Because this was her community-property interest in
her ex-husband's plan, rather than her own retirement plan, I
wonder whether she can take money out of the 401(k) without paying
the 10 percent tax penalty for premature withdrawal. (She is less
than 591/2 years old.)
<P>
   A: If the retirement plan is a qualified plan under Internal
Revenue Service regulations, and if the divorce decree is what is
known in legal parlance as a qualified domestic relations order,
then yes, she can take money out of the plan without paying a tax
penalty. She will, of course, have to pay ordinary tax.
</P>
<P>
   Early next year, the airline will send your wife a 1099-R form _
the form for pension income _ reminding you how much she withdrew.
It also will send a copy to the Internal Revenue Service, with
coding indicating that the penalty tax does not apply.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Roth Accounts
</P>
<P>
   Q: I noticed that the IRS recently extended the deadline for
conversions of Roth individual retirement accounts from October 15
to the end of this year. Does that mean I still have time to
convert my traditional IRA to a Roth and spread the taxes over four
years?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm afraid you have things mixed up.
</P>
<P>
   The deadline extension gives taxpayers who already have
converted to Roths a little more time to convert back to
traditional IRAs. They would want to do this if they belatedly
discovered that they were ineligible to convert to a Roth _ if they
exceed the legal income limit, for example _ or if they find that
converting back will help them financially.
</P>
<P>
   It would help them financially if their IRA assets were worth
more when they converted to a Roth than they are now. The taxes
incurred when they converted were based on the size of the assets
at that time. If they convert back to a traditional IRA, they can
nullify the original transaction and pay less tax if they convert
back to a Roth.
</P>
<P>
   The four-year rule you are referring to is no longer available.
It allowed taxpayers who converted to a Roth before the end of last
year to spread payment of the conversion tax over four years. That
was a nice break _ but it is gone.
</P>
<P>
   However, you still can convert your traditional IRA to a Roth,
provided you meet the income requirement _ namely, if your adjusted
gross income for the year is $100,000 or less, regardless of
whether you are single or filing a joint return with a spouse.
</P>
<P>
   The income limits are higher if you create a Roth from scratch,
rather than rolling over a traditional plan. Single taxpayers can
do that if they have incomes no greater than $110,000, while
married taxpayers filing jointly can start a Roth if they have
total income no greater than $160,000.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Mutual Funds
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a couple of mutual funds within the same fund family.
I know I can sell my shares and move the money to another fund in
the family without paying a capital-gains tax. I was wondering: Can
I can sell my shares, take the proceeds and buy stock through my
online brokerage firm without paying a capital-gains tax?
</P>
<P>
   A: No _ assuming that you do indeed have capital gains. If you
do, then this is definitely a taxable event. If you don't, then of
course you won't have to pay a capital-gains tax, and you can use a
capital loss to offset gains from other transactions.
</P>
<P>
   But hold on a minute.
</P>
<P>
   You claim that you can avoid the capital-gains tax if you sell
shares but stay within the same fund family.
</P>
<P>
   Who told you that?
</P>
<P>
   The IRS says that's not true for ordinary accounts. ``Any time
you tell them to sell a share, that's a capital event,'' says
spokesman Jesse Weller. You even have to pay taxes when you make a
profit from the sale of a tax-exempt bond fund _ for example, one

 JEEVES _ SF CHRON  
 Ask Jeeves Suffers Big Loss After IPO  &HT;     By Tom Stein 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Following in the footsteps of most Internet startups, Ask Jeeves
Inc. in Emeryville reported a substantial net loss for its first
financial quarter since going public in July.
<P>
   The company, which makes natural-language search-engine
technology, announced yesterday a loss of $9.3 million (37 cents a
share) for its third quarter of 1999, which ended September 30.
That compares with a loss of about $918,000 in the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue for the quarter jumped dramatically to $6.5 million from
$113,000 as the company landed a handful of corporate customers,
including Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard and Martha Stewart Living, who
pay Ask Jeeves anywhere from $300,000 to $1 million to license its
technology.
</P>
<P>
   At www.marthastewart.com, for instance, the technology allows
brides-to-be to ask plain English questions like ``How much should
I pay for my wedding?'' and receive instant answers.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Jeeves also host a popular consumer site at www.ask.com,
where visitors can ask any number of questions and be directed to
the Web site with the appropriate answer.
</P>
<P>
   Ask.com is the 40th-most-popular Web site in the United States,
with about 4 million people visiting the site in September. The
company generates revenue by running advertisements on the site. It
also has an e-commerce component whereby the site links consumers
to other retail sites and then takes a cut of any online
transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue from the consumer site outpaced corporate sales by a
ratio of about 2 to 1. But the company said it believes revenue
will be split down the middle by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Jeeves executives also said in a conference call that they
expect the company to keep losing money until 2002 as it invests in
burnishing its brand name, hiring more sales people and beefing up
its technology infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a breakout quarter for us in corporate services,
which is a more substantial opportunity than we originally
expected,'' said Ask Jeeves chief executive Rob Wrubel, in the
conference call. ``To capture market leadership we need to
accelerate our growth strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors weren't quite as enthusiastic about all the red ink.
The stock dropped $5, or about 6 percent, to $78 in yesterday's
regular trading session. Ask Jeeves reported after the closing
bell, but in after-hours trading, the stock was holding at $78.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe there is no real pressure on Ask Jeeves to make
money immediately. Instead, they said, it's more important for the
company to continue to strengthen its position in the corporate
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, Wall Street is not forcing them to be profitable,''
said Stan Corker, an analyst with Emerald Research in Lancaster,
Penn. ``They have the freedom to invest in advertising and brand
recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the company is spending money on such marketing ventures
as sponsoring a float at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade.
</P>
<P>
   Corker believes the company's real potential is on the corporate
side of the business. That's because companies usually pay about
$15 every time an employee picks up the phone to answer a customer
service question. With the Ask Jeeves technology, companies can
greatly reduce costs because they no longer have to hire real
people to respond to questions, according to Corker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors are starting to put a high valuation on Ask Jeeves
just on the corporate side,'' he said. ``The consumer stuff is just
icing on the cake.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Butler, vice president of Officedepot.com, agrees that Ask
Jeeves is a valuable marketing tool for his company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology gives us an understanding of questions that are
being asked and not getting answered, such as `Do you sell yellow
markers?''' said Butler. ``We can evaluate the data and see what
requests we are getting for items we don't carry, but should.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask Jeeves said it expects to sign several hundred corporate
customers by 2002, up from 25 today. It also predicted that revenue
would hit about $250 million by 2002, with $50 million in profits
that year.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Chevron Earnings Up, But More Layoffs Planned  &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
San Francisco's Chevron Corp. yesterday announced
higher-than-expected earnings but also plans to cut an additional
400 jobs, raising the total to 3,100. It was the third upward
revision the company has made since December, when it announced
plans to cut 1,000 positions.
<P>
   Spokeswoman Dawn Soper said it is not clear how many Bay Area
jobs will be terminated. The cuts are being made through attrition,
early retirement, buyouts and the sale of subsidiaries, she said,
but would give no specifics.
</P>
<P>
   Also yesterday, Chevron said third-quarter earnings before
special charges rose 82 percent from the same period last year,
coming in at $702 million ($1.07 a share), compared with a First
Call consensus estimate of $1.01.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron said lower operating costs and higher energy prices
produced the increase in profits.
</P>
<P>
   After special charges, net income rose 26 percent, to $582
million (88 cents). Special charges included asset write-downs and
a loss on the sale of Koa Oil Co., a joint venture with Texaco.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues increased 32 percent, to $10.2 billion from $7.7
billion in the third quarter of last year. The company is on track
to cut $500 million in operating costs this year.
</P>
<P>
   Soper said the job-cut estimates ``have changed as we've gone
through a more in-depth analysis.'' Some of the Chevron's operating
companies still are evaluating their payroll needs as part of an
ongoing restructuring, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron employed 31,617 people worldwide at the end of
September, down from 33,676 at the end of 1998. The conglomerate
has been trimming payroll for many years; in 1990, for example, it
had 54,208 employees. Those numbers do not include service-station
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an industrywide movement,'' said Edward Maran, an
analyst with A.G. Edwards. ``Across the board, every single major
integrated oil company is continuing to reduce its head count.
(Companies) are finding they can cut more people without it
adversely affecting their operations.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past five years, under pressure from Wall Street, oil
companies have changed their focus from production growth to
earnings growth, which necessitates cost-cutting, Maran said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exxon has been the leader,'' Maran said. ``Over the past five
years, Exxon has not grown its production at all, yet its stock
dramatically outperformed the group because it kept dramatically
increasing its profits.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend has accelerated with recent megamergers. For example,
BP recently acquired Amoco, and Exxon now is buying Mobil. ``The
companies that are left, like Shell, Texaco and Chevron, feel a
great need to compete and show they can cut costs aggressively
without doing a merger,'' Maran said.
</P>
<P>
   Oil stocks generally declined yesterday, even more than the
overall market, despite higher than expected earnings from Chevron
and others. Chevron's stock dropped $3.75, to $90. ``I would have
expected, with such strong earnings, they would have at least
matched &UR;  &LR; or outperformed the market (yesterday),'' Maran said.

 &HT;    Runaway plane crashes, kills U.S. Open champ Stewart, 4 others
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving to (a) General news and (s) Sports categories.)
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Golf champion Payne Stewart, his two agents and two pilots took
off Monday morning from Orlando in a Learjet 35. They were supposed
to climb to 39,000 feet near the Florida Panhandle, then cruise
through Dixie on a leisurely flight to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the silvery-white business plane probably lost cabin
pressure _ rendering its crew and passengers unconscious _ then
exhausted its fuel after nearly four hours on autopilot before
spiraling wildly into a South Dakota cow pasture midday Monday,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The reigning U.S. Open champion and his associates probably died
even before the twin turbofan smashed into the flatlands of Mina,
S.D., as television viewers tracked the flight into the country's
heartland.
</P>
<P>
   The thin air of high altitude and a failure of the 23-year-old
plane's pressurization system are suspect in the deadly flight.
Unless planes are pressurized above 12,000 feet, passengers would
have difficulty breathing and eventually die from a lack of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   In vain, Air Force fighters and flight controllers tried
contacting the pilots as the plane flew steadily northwest to its
doom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have happened gradually,'' Mike Boyd, an aviation
consultant in Golden, Colo., said Monday in an interview. ``The air
gets thin if you're not pressurized, and you start falling asleep.
They were probably dead before they got to South Dakota.''
</P>
<P>
   Controllers cleared the plane to reach a cruising altitude of
39,000 feet as it approached Gainesville, Fla., officials said.
It's about there the plane should have turned left toward Texas. By
then, pilots Michael Kling, 43, and Stephanie Bellegarrigue, 27,
probably had switched on the autopilot.
</P>
<P>
   The flight plan listed five people onboard. However, golf legend
Jack Nicklaus said Monday he feared one of his course designers,
40-year-old Bruce Borland, also was on the plane to get acquainted
with Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Air-traffic controllers made their last contact at Gainesville.
Eventually, the plane reached 45,000 feet as the aircraft burned
fuel, shed weight and climbed. At 41,000 feet, the Learjet is
designed to reach 529 mph.
</P>
<P>
   By the time fighter jets sent to intercept the flight reached
Stewart's plane, the windows had already iced over on the inside,
indicating freezing temperatures and loss of cabin pressure. In an
emergency, the pilots of a Learjet 35 can grab oxygen masks, which
deploy automatically for passengers. The plane also has a warning
system for depressurization.
</P>
<P>
   Even casual golf fans recognized Stewart, who wore knickers and
a tam on the golf course. The 42-year-old Orlando resident won the
U.S. Open during a final-hole duel with Phil Mickelson in June. A
graduate of Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Stewart was
expected in Houston today for practice rounds for the Tour
Championship, the Professional Golfers Association last tournament
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tremendous loss for the entire golfing community and
all of sports,'' PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem said. ``He will
always be remembered as a very special competitor and one who
contributed enormously to the positive image of professional
golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's agents Robert Fraley and Van Ardan died in the plane,
said family spokesman Bill Curry. Fraley was chief executive
officer of Leader Enterprises Inc., and Ardan was president of the
sports management company.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart is survived by his wife, Tracey, daughter Chelsea, 13,
and son Aaron, 10. A 20-year veteran of the PGA tour, Stewart
proclaimed his religious devotion after winning the U.S. Open for
the second time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of the fact that my faith in God is so much stronger
and I'm so much more at peace with myself than I've ever been in my
life,'' Stewart said. ``Where I was with my faith last year and
where I am now is leaps and bounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunset Aviation of Orlando, Fla., which provided the pilots for
Monday's chartered flight, had listed the aircraft for sale on its
Web site. The ad said the plane had more than 10,000 hours total
air time, 7,523 landings, an executive door, drag chute and
auxiliary cabin heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``This aircraft is in premium condition inside and out,'' the
online ad said. ``It has high quality paint and interior in a
complimenting gray and burgundy color scheme. . . .The maintenance
performed has been meticulous. . . . All log books are complete and
up to date.''
</P>
<P>
   When the plane veered from its prefiled path, the Federal
Aviation Administration notified the Air Force. Officials
dispatched a fighter from Tyndall Air Force Base on a training
flight near the Florida Panhandle. Two fighters from Florida's
Eglin Air Force Base, also in the Panhandle, then followed before a
pair of Air National Guard F-16s from Tulsa, Okla., took over.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Dunn, the owner of Montana's Bar in Mina, S.D., had
tracked the flight on television. He had heard the broadcast
speculation that the autopilot was switched on and reports that no
one had responded to radio messages. That meant everyone was
unconscious, perhaps dead. The bar owner stepped outside and
watched.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started flopping and going crazy,'' Dunn said in a
telephone interview. ``Then it just came straight down.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn jumped into his Jeep and was one of the first people to
reach the scene. He called 911.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them there was no need to get real excited about
sending ambulances because everyone was already dead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The descent took about 12 seconds, Dunn guessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a hole in the ground,'' he said. ``Pieces of
aircraft and body parts.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Olson lives on a Mina farm six miles west of the crash site.
She stepped on her deck and peered through binoculars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw two dark jets,'' Olson said in an interview. ``While I
was watching, I saw a flash, not a fire, but a silver-and-white
flash. Then it came down.''
</P>
<P>
   Postal carrier Lorie Heinz said she climbed out of her Plymouth
minivan during her route when she heard a loud rumble. Fighter jets
thundered overhead about 600 feet. Not till later did she know a
plane was in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two planes went by,'' Heinz said on the telephone. ``God,
that's pretty low, I thought. Holy smokes. Then I saw a white
streak. I thought they had dropped something out of their plane. It
flew straight then it nosedived. Then it did two twirls to the
left. It was spinning.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Heinz felt the ground shake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the debris fly,'' she said. ``It was smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the FAA and the National Transportation Safety
Board headed for the crash site Monday. Advisers informed President
Clinton about the accident during a meeting with his economic
staff.
</P>
<P>
   A computer check of the FAA incident data system report showed
one citation on the plane. In 1986, the pilot made an unauthorized
turn during departure from Cincinnati's Lunken Field and caused a
traffic conflict. There were no passengers on board. The pilot was
not identified.
</P>
<P>
   The Learjet 35 has an ``excellent'' safety record, said Pete
West, senior vice president of government and public affairs for
the National Business Aviation Association in Washington. The group
monitors safety issues for businesses that operate planes for
executive commuting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very, very unique situation,'' West said. ``It's
interesting that the Air Force aircraft said they couldn't see
anything. . . . If the autopilot is on, the plane flies until the
fuel runs out.''

 Agilent Sets Terms for an Initial Offering  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Agilent Technologies, the subsidiary of Hewlett-Packard Co.
focusing on test and measurement devices, has set the terms of its
initial public offering of 57 million shares, intended to raise an
estimated $1.1 billion.
<P>
   The company's shares will debut in a projected range of $19 to
$22 apiece, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission
filing.
</P>
<P>
   Agilent spokeswoman Amy Flores said the IPO likely will be held
by the end of the year. However, she said a formula has not yet
been determined for allotting Agilent stock to existing
Hewlett-Packard shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard will retain about 87 percent of Agilent's common
stock. Holders of stock in the Palo Alto computer giant can expect
to receive Agilent shares by the middle of next year, Flores said.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard said in March that it will spin off its
noncomputer operations to allow the company to bolster its core
computer and printer businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Agilent, which is slated to begin operating on November 1, will
have annual sales of about $8 billion and will absorb approximately
43,000 Hewlett-Packard employees. The company will be run by Ned
Barnholt, 56, who has been with Hewlett-Packard for more than 30
years.
</P>
<P>
   Mona Eraiba, an analyst with Gruntal &AMP; Co. in New York, said the
spin-off ``definitely unleashes the value that Agilent has.''
</P>
<P>
   She said investors probably will find that Agilent's stock will
show more short-term growth than Hewlett-Packard's, though the
parent company will remain a stronger long-term investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Agilent's stock will certainly go higher, and this
will help HP's stock,'' Eraiba said.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard closed yesterday at $76.13, up 25 cents from
Friday. The company's stock is well off its 52-week high of
$118.44, buffeted by general weakness in the technology sector,
last month's earthquake in Taiwan and an expected increase in
semiconductor prices, as well as last week's profit warning from
rival International Business Machines Corp.
</P>
<P>
   According to its SEC filing, Agilent will have 437 million
shares outstanding after the IPO. A share price of $20.50 _ the
middle of the projected offering range _ would give the company an
initial market value of about $9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Agilent accounted for roughly 17 percent of Hewlett-Packard's
total revenue of $47 billion last year. However, investors and
analysts seldom take notice of the parent company's production of
diagnostic electronics and testing gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one owns HP for that business,'' said Jim Berlino, an
analyst with CIBC World Markets in New York. ``The fact that
they're spinning it off is an enormous positive. It will make the
HP story less confusing.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hewlett-Packard still isn't winning any prizes for
warp-speed responsiveness to market changes, Berlino gave high
marks to the company's new chief executive, Carly Fiorina, who he
said ``isn't shying away from any of the problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Agilent's Flores said work is continuing on the new company's
headquarters, being built on the site where the original
Hewlett-Packard building stood in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 senior executives will move into the space by next
May, she said. Other Agilent operations will remain in their
present locations in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be answering the phones as Agilent Technologies as of
next Monday,'' Flores observed, ``but we'll still be a subsidiary
of Hewlett-Packard until the IPO.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that employees generally have reacted favorably to the
new company's name, which was concocted by San Francisco brand
consultant Landor Associates and drew mixed reviews from
professional linguists.
</P>
<P>
   ``People seem happy with it,'' Flores said, ``now that they
realize that not everything has to mean something.''

 _ SF CHRON  
 ExciteAtHome to Buy Online Card Company  &HT;     By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Bluemountainarts.com, the folksy online greeting card company that
got its start in a Boulder couple's attic, said yesterday that it
will be acquired by ExciteAtHome Corp. for $780 million in cash and
stock.
<P>
   ExciteAtHome of Redwood City said it is buying privately held
Blue Mountain to cash in on the card company's loyal following. The
site, which lets users send free greeting cards via e-mail, is one
of the most heavily visited on the Web, pulling in more than 9
million unique users per month.
</P>
<P>
   ExciteAtHome, which provides Web content and high-speed Internet
access, said it's buying Blue Mountain to generate advertising and
e-commerce revenues and lure subscribers to its high-speed cable
modem business.
</P>
<P>
   It will continue to offer Blue Mountain cards at no cost and for
every occasion _ from National Pig Day (March 1) to birthday cards
for pets.
</P>
<P>
   The variety and price _ free _ are two reasons why Blue Mountain
was the fourth-busiest e-commerce site in September. Users return
to the site an average of two times per month.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition will raise ExciteAtHome from the
sixth-most-visited site overall to No.5, knocking Disney's Go
Network down a notch, according to research firm Media Metrix.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its popularity, Blue Mountain had no aggressive
e-commerce or advertising strategy. ExciteAtHome thinks that it can
use Blue Mountain's heavy traffic to sell more ads and create
online shopping opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a person sending a free birthday card from Blue
Mountain might be enticed to buy a gift online from one of Excite's
retail partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every greeting card represents an event-based commerce
opportunity, whether it's a birthday or a Bar Mitzvah,'' said
ExciteAtHome President George Bell.
</P>
<P>
   But Bell said the main reason for buying Blue Mountain was to
persuade its customers to switch from their dial-up Internet
service provider to AtHome's cable modem service.
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the reasons AtHome bought Excite, a major Web
portal, last spring. Company officials said they're committed to
acquiring more Web sites to attract cable-modem users.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main benefit is that it expands the population that are
exposed to ExciteAtHome, and if Excite can utilize that customer
base to market its broadband service, so much the better,'' said
Drake Johnstone, an analyst with Davenport &AMP; Co. in Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Mountain site grew out of a traditional greeting card
business run by Susan Polis Schutz and Stephen Schutz. The pair
started Blue Mountain Arts in 1970 by selling silk-screened posters
and greeting cards door-to-door. Three years ago, their son, Jared,
persuaded them to start an Internet site _ Bluemountainarts.com _
as a hobby, and the three ran it out of their attic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It grew beyond all our wildest expectations,'' said Jared
Schutz, Blue Mountain's executive director. ``It struck a chord in
people, and it resonated with something in the consumer psyche.''
</P>
<P>
   Jared Schutz said the company was trying to decide whether to
sell the business or take it public. The owners went with
ExciteAtHome, he said, because Excite agreed to continue offering
the cards for free and shared a similar vision for the company.
</P>
<P>
   The Schutzes are keeping Blue Mountain Arts, the traditional
greeting card company, and are selling only the online division.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Stevens, an executive vice president with ExciteAtHome,
said the Schutz family ``will continue to work with us in a
creative role ... losing that would be a tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   ExciteAtHome will issue about 11 million shares, valued at about
$430 million, and pay $350 million in cash for Blue Mountain.
ExciteAtHome also will assume all outstanding employee options. The
deal is expected to close before the end of the year, the companies
said.

 _ SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE  
 Proposed Hospital Merger Goes on Trial  &HT;     By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
State Attorney General Bill Lockyer asked a federal judge in San
Francisco yesterday to block the proposed merger of the East Bay's
two largest hospitals, lest they create a ``hegemony'' capable of
raising health insurance rates in Oakland and Berkeley.
<P>
   Lockyer's remarks came on the opening day of a trial on the
proposed merger of Oakland's Summit Medical Center with Berkeley's
Alta Bates Medical Center. Alta Bates is part of Sutter Health, a
chain of 26 hospitals mostly in Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   Lockyer sued Sutter, Summit and Alta Bates in August, alleging
that the combination would give them a 48 percent share of the East
Bay hospital market, enough to institute a post-merger price
increase of at least 5 to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Summit attorney Maureen McGuirl urged District Judge Maxine
Chesney to permit the merger, arguing that it was the only way to
prevent Summit from running out of cash by the end of the year and
laying off 200 workers, or 9 percent of its staff.
</P>
<P>
   Chesney, who has scheduled a four-day trial, listened as
attorneys for the two sides laid out starkly different versions of
the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The state asserted that Summit could have merged with a
different hospital chain and continued to compete with Alta Bates,
its main rival.
</P>
<P>
   The Sutter side argued that a merger of the two nonprofit
hospitals would create one healthy system serving Oakland and
Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Chesney has not said when she would decide the case, although
attorneys think she will issue her decision before Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Lockyer challenged the merger after the Federal Trade Commission
ended a long investigation without taking action. Legal sources
said the FTC ducked the case because the federal courts have been
reluctant to block any hospital mergers, particularly those in
urban areas served by many hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   In his brief opening remarks, Lockyer acknowledged that this is
the first challenge to an urban-hospital merger in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the antitrust laws to have real meaning it's not enough
that they be applied only to rural areas,'' Lockyer said. ``They
have to be made to apply in the inner East Bay.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockyer's deputy, antitrust specialist John Donhoff, showed a
map of the Bay Area dotted with 30 hospitals, but said the merger
would give Summit and Alta Bates 48 percent of the market from
Pinole south to Union City, between the bay and the hills.
</P>
<P>
   He said patients would be trapped in this area by traffic and
commute patterns, and unable to switch to cheaper hospitals outside
the area if Summit and Alta Bates used their ``hegemony'' to raise
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``One can't ask a pregnant mother to go on BART to have her
baby,'' Donhoff argued.
</P>
<P>
   Sutter attorney George Manning ridiculed that assertion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you believe the plaintiff's market (definition), you
believe people still travel in Conestoga wagons, and no one is
going over the hills because they're too high, and you have to
build a boat to go over the bay,'' Manning said.
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to prove that Summit still has an alternative to
combining with Alta Bates, state attorneys called as a witness Eric
Tuckman, a vice president with Tenet Healthcare Corp., the nation's
second-largest for-profit hospital chain.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet offered to acquire Summit in March 1998 but was rebuffed.
When asked whether Tenet was still interested in Summit, Tuckman
said ``the hospital still has strategic importance to Tenet and we
would certainly take a look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   But under cross-examination from Summit attorney McGuirl,
Tuckman said Tenet's offer had been conditioned on getting a closer
look at Summit's books, and that he was not in a position to make
``a quantitative offer'' for Summit before considering the
hospital's current financial state.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's trial offered a rare glimpse at the closed-door
deals that dictate prices in the modern hospital market.
</P>
<P>
   The state called Curtis Terry, a vice president from Blue Cross,
to testify about how, in 1997, Sutter had used its market clout to
force the HMO to negotiate one standard payment rate for all of
Sutter's hospitals in Northern California _ instead of negotiating
with each hospital individually.
</P>
<P>
   Terry said that if Summit became part of Sutter, Blue Cross
would immediately have to pay the higher hospital rates that Sutter
has already negotiated at other Sutter hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   But under cross-examination from Sutter attorneys, Terry
admitted that other hospital chains, including Tenet, also have
forced Blue Cross to negotiate payment plans that cover every
hospital in the chain.
</P>
<P>
   The state also submitted evidence that the merger is opposed by
nine of 14 health plans serving the East Bay, including Aetna U.S.
Healthcare and the Alameda Alliance for Health, which provides
insurance to poor families. The state, only four health plans,
notably Kaiser and HealthNet, support the merger, with one
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   To expedite the trial, Chesney has limited each side to a few
witnesses. The state will resume its case today by calling James
Langenfeld, former director of antitrust for the FTC, to support
the state's contention a merged Summit and Alta Bates would have
the power to force price increases that would be passed on to HMO
customers in the East Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Sutter and Summit will get a chance to present three
witnesses _ economist Margaret Guerin-Calvert, hospital expert
Bruce Den Uyl, and Summit board member Claude Hutchinson _ to
bolster their case that the current merger deal complies with
federal antitrust laws.

U.N. CREATES AN AUTHORITY TO START GOVERNING EAST TIMOR 
</HEADLINE>
 . N . -NYT (ms) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The Security Council Monday created the
authority for the United Nations to take over East Timor and
administer the former Indonesian territory until it is strong and
stable enough to become fully independent, a process that officials
said could take years.
</P>
<P>
   In the resolution, the council's 15 member countries unanimously
approved deploying 9,150 military peacekeepers and observers, 1,640
police officers and hundreds of civilian administrators and aid
workers to establish an interim government in cooperation with the
East Timorese people under the United Nations flag.
</P>
<P>
   The new mission, formally known as the United Nations
Transitional Administration in East Timor, will replace the
Australian-led force that moved in to restore order last month.
After the 800,000 residents of East Timor voted overwhelmingly on
Aug. 30 for independence, many were attacked by militias loyal to
Indonesia and driven from their houses, which were often looted and
torched.
</P>
<P>
   After the Security Council's approval of the mission,
Secretary-General Kofi Annan told reporters: ``It's an important
challenge, and I think it is a crucial stage in the lives of the
people of East Timor. We will establish the mission as quickly as
we can.''
</P>
<P>
   He confirmed that he would appoint Sergio de Mello, a
Brazilian as undersecretary-general in charge of coordinating
relief and refugee affairs, to govern East Timor during the
transition as his special representative.
</P>
<P>
   Under international pressure, the Indonesia People's
Consultative Assembly agreed last week to give up Jakarta's claim
to East Timor, a former Portuguese colony that Indonesian troops
occupied in 1975 and annexed the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's representative at the United Nations, Makmur Widodo,
assured the Security Council on Monday that ``we will honor the
outcome of the popular consultation and insure that the separation
from Indonesia is carried out in an orderly and dignified way.''
</P>
<P>
   The undersecretary-general for peacekeeping, Bernard Miyet,
later described the mission in East Timor as one of the largest and
most costly that the United Nations has undertaken. Miyet said it
would be ``very ambitious and complex'' and could cost up to $1
billion in the first year.
</P>
<P>
   The closest precedent for the effort may be the United Nations'
transitional role in guiding Namibia toward independence in 1990.
Namibia happens to sit on the present Security Council and
supported the United Nations role in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   But although the South Africans left behind a relatively
sophisticated communications and transportation network in Namibia,
East Timor has been devastated by wanton destruction of its towns
and villages by pro-Indonesian militants. Miyet said the contingent
would include engineers and communications specialists, as well as
foot soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Before the vote Monday, the Australian representative, Penny
Wensley, pointed out that the mission ``must also build the
foundations for a democratic and stable state, a constitution, a
legal system and judiciary, a police force and a Civil Service.''
</P>
<P>
   The deputy U.S. representative, Peter Burleigh, urged particular
attention to the plight of refugees who fled East Timor only to be
intimidated in camps in West Timor, which remains under Indonesian
rule. ``They must have security in the camps, access to
international assistance and the right to return home,'' Burleigh
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council, in its resolution, expressed deep concern
about the ``grave humanitarian situation'' in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Widodo described reports of human rights violations as
``unverified and often exaggerated.''
</P>
<P>
   China insisted that an explicit call in the resolution for a
commission of inquiry into human rights abuses be deleted, but
accepted less specific language asking all parties to ``cooperate
with humanitarian and human rights organizations'' in East Timor.

 Alternatives to U.S. Stocks Could Safeguard Your Portfolio  &HT;     By Arthur M. Louis 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
The aging bull market has suffered some hard knocks in recent
months, leading many investors to wonder whether it finally might
be time to seek an alternative to U.S. stocks.
<P>
   With interest rates edging higher, with inflation warnings once
again in vogue, with market leaders like IBM hobbled by earnings
problems and with the Dow Jones industrial average zigging and
zagging nearly 10 percent below the high reached two months ago,
the bull run of the late '90s no longer looks like a sure thing as
we stagger toward the next century.
</P>
<P>
   But if U.S. stocks scare you, what are the alternatives?
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons the stock market has soared so high during
the past five years is that investors haven't come up with a viable
substitute. They have continued to invest their 401(k)
contributions and other money in stocks and stock mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, despite the stock market's hair-raising performance
during the summer and fall, the old bull may have enough life left
to charge ahead. some more. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  ``I don't believe in trying to time the market,'' says Norm
Boone of Boone Financial Advisors in San Francisco. ``If you're
feeling like the market is too volatile, you probably shouldn't be
a stock investor in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, if you fear that the market is overpriced and investors
are facing a doomsday scenario and if you absolutely demand an
alternative, three choices come to mind: gold, fixed-income
securities and foreign stocks.
</P>
<P>
   In times of stock-market uncertainty, many eyes turn to gold
because of its centuries-long history as a coveted medium of
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Gold also is supposed to be a classic hedge against inflation
and calamitous political upheaval _ in case you are worried about
Y2K, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Priced above $800 an ounce during the inflationary spiral of the
early 1980s, gold plunged into the mid-$200 range during the
low-inflation 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   However, late last month and early this month, its price surged
by more than $80 per ounce, to as high as $337, though mainly for
technical reasons: The European central bankers canceled a plan to
sell off much of their gold reserves, which would have burdened the
market with too much supply.
</P>
<P>
   Gold since has settled back near the $300 mark _ but if you
think it might resume its upswing, there are multiple ways to
invest in it.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy stock in gold-mining companies, on the premise that
rising gold prices will make them more profitable.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy gold directly _ most conveniently in the form of
coins issued by the U.S. and foreign governments, containing
exactly one ounce of gold apiece. Dealers say they have been doing
a land-office business in gold coins lately.
</P>
<P>
   You can speculate in gold futures _ an extremely risky venture
suitable only for investors with deep pockets and cast-iron
stomachs. By putting down slightly more than $1,000 on margin, you
can buy or sell a 100-ounce gold contract, worth more than $30,000
at current price levels.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well, and the price of gold rises, then you can sell
the contract at a profit. On the other hand, if the market moves
against you, your entire margin deposit could be wiped out in a few
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream financial advisers ridicule gold, considering it
quirky, extremist and, worst of all, not necessarily profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Boone contends that gold has little fundamental value. It isn't
backed by corporate earnings, brand names and goodwill. Its value
hinges largely on psychology _ sort of like an Internet stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you're doing is hoping that someone else will be willing
to pay you more for it than you paid,'' he observes.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Safe, But Small Returns
</P>
<P>
   If gold isn't the answer, what about fixed-income securities,
such as U.S. Treasuries, money-market mutual funds or bank
certificates of deposit?
</P>
<P>
   They are all safe enough _ particularly Treasuries, which are
widely regarded as the safest investments on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   But even after the recent upticks in interest rates,
fixed-incomes still offer paltry investment returns.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of last week, U.S. Treasuries were yielding a bit
more than 6 percent annually, while the highest-yielding
money-market funds were paying about 5.5 percent and the
highest-yielding five-year CDs were at less than 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Those yields don't have much appeal for investors who have come
to believe _ based on the experience of the past five years _ that
the stock market goes up 20 percent or more every year.
</P>
<P>
   Even more-realistic investors _ those who know that the
historical average stock-market gain is only about 10 percent
annually, including reinvestment of dividends _ will look down
their noses at 5, 6 or even 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   They already have built expectations of a 10 percent annual
return into their retirement planning. They are counting on that
from their 401(k) plans and their individual retirement accounts.
To accept barely more than half that much even for a short while
would keep them on the job longer than they wish.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, interest rates eventually could rise well above their
present levels, particularly if the Federal Reserve fails to
contain inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But that would be all the more reason not to buy most
fixed-income securities now. You would be locking in interest rates
that are lower than you could get later _ and with Treasuries or
other bonds, you would suffer declining prices, as well, because
bond prices move in the opposite direction from rates.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves foreign stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Buying foreign stocks _ or foreign-stock mutual funds, which
would be the wiser course for Americans who aren't experts on
overseas markets _ has made sense in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Burton Malkiel and Jianping Mei point out in their book,
``Global Bargain Hunting,'' that the performance of foreign stock
markets often runs counter to the performance of U.S. markets.
That's at least partly because the economies of other nations
aren't necessarily in synch with the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   The authors show, using historical data, that a portfolio
holding both U.S. and foreign stocks usually produces a better
investment performance over the long run than a U.S.-only
portfolio. In addition, the performance tends to be less volatile
from year to year in a mixed portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   So, whenever the U.S. market is in the dumps, you might be able
to patch things up by mixing foreign stocks into your portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Buying Asian stocks in particular would have been a great idea
at the start of this year.
</P>
<P>
   While the U.S. market, as measured by the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index, is ahead by only 6 percent since the end of 1998, the
principal market indexes of Korea, Japan and Hong Kong are ahead 47
percent, 35 percent and 28 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Many investment advisers warn that even if the U.S. stock market
scares you, it might not be advisable to do anything as radical as
switching to other types of investments.
</P>
<P>
   The market invariably comes back from slumps, they say, and the
current slump might not turn out to be all that bad. Anyone willing
to risk money in the stock market, their reasoning goes, should get
used to the fact that stock markets have their downs as well as ups
and that nobody can predict them consistently.
</P>
<P>
   Financial planner Richard DelMonte of DelMonte Group in Danville
says: ``I'm not telling anybody to change their mix at all. You
should not be making any changes just because of short-term
turbulence.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Turner, president of Pring Turner Capital Corp. in San
Ramon, believes that stocks might fall another 10 percent from
their current levels.
</P>
<P>
   But to hedge against that, he suggests, investors could cut
their exposure to the market. ``If you are 100 percent invested,
you might want to reduce it to 90 percent or 80 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   That way, if the pessimism is unfounded and prices resume their
climb, you won't completely miss out on the gains.
</P>
<P>
   Turner says you also might want to phase out of high-volatility,
high-risk stocks _ such as Internet and technology issues, or
stocks that have shot up after recent initial public offerings _
and into ``something of high quality, like PG&AMP;E.''
</P>
<P>
   Other advisers recommend that investors keep their U.S. stocks
and buy more if the markets slides more.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have at least a 10-year time horizon, then you should
pray for a down market,'' says Kurt Brouwer, of Brouwer &AMP;
Janachowski in Tiburon. ``You should use such an opportunity to add
to your account.''

A GOLFER AT THE TOP OF HIS GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He achieved victories that men in his profession can only dream
about, US Open titles that had cruelly escaped the grasp of some of
golf's greatest legends. But what spoke volumes about the makeup of
Payne Stewart was what he considered his greatest triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``1982 at Quad City. And that will never change, no matter how
many _ if I'm fortunate enough to win more majors or more golf
tournaments. The 1982 Quad Cities will be my most cherished
victory.''
</P>
<P>
   The words were spoken a few months ago, on Father's Day, just
after Stewart had made one of the most dramatic putts in golf
history, a 15-footer to save par on the 72d hole of the US Open.
With that putt, at the fabled Pinehurst No. 2 in Pinehurst, N.C.,
Stewart became just the 18th player to win the US Open more than
once and earned a lofty spot in the game's history.
</P>
<P>
   The paycheck for his Pinehurst win was $625,000, but it couldn't
buy its way to the top spot in Stewart's heart. That remained the
1982 Quad City Classic, his first professional win, which came with
his father in attendance. William Stewart would die a few years
later, but father and son always had Quad City.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was there and we had a good cry on the green,'' said
Stewart, a refreshingly honest and emotional player who used to
joke that he cried easily.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the tears were in his memory.
</P>
<P>
   One of the world's most accomplished golfers, certainly one of
the sport's very special people, the 42-year-old Stewart was among
five people killed in a jet crash in South Dakota. His is survived
by his wife, Tracey, a daughter, Chelsea, 13, and a son, Aaron, 10,
not to mention countless golf fans who respected Stewart for his
determined style of play, his candor, and his willingness to stand
out from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   He did the latter by wearing his trademark knickers, which set
him apart from hundreds of colleagues who dressed so much alike.
Stewart donned the knickers a few years after turning pro in 1979
and was rarely seen in competition without them.
</P>
<P>
   They became part of his ``mystique,'' said Mark Lye, who broke
into pro golf in the early 1980s. But Lye and others felt Stewart
always enjoyed a residual effect _ when he left the course, slipped
into jeans, and went out into the public, no one recognized him.
Dinners were peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he liked that,'' said Lye.
</P>
<P>
   What he liked even more was spirited competition. Growing up in
Springfield, Mo., Stewart was introduced to the game by his father,
who had a passion for golf. It rubbed off on the son, who won the
Missouri State Amateur and earned a golf scholarship to Southern
Methodist University in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart possessed a classic golf swing that was the envy of some
of the world's most polished players, but he was not saturated in
talent. Everything he got out of his game was earned through dogged
determination and a focus that sometimes hurt his image. It
bordered on cockiness early in his career, and as he grew older and
more mature, Stewart conceded that he had rubbed people the wrong
way when he first turned pro.
</P>
<P>
   After breaking into pro golf on the Australasia Tour (he met
Tracey, an Australian, during this time), Stewart returned to the
US PGA Tour in 1981 and though he won three times in the next eight
years, his reputation was that of a golfer who couldn't get the job
done; 18 times he finished second or third.
</P>
<P>
   That wore on him, he would say years later, and led to some
behavior he regretted. Like an outward show of joy (a serious
breach of golf etiquette) as Mike Reid fell apart down the stretch
in the 1989 PGA Championship, thus giving Stewart his first major
championship.
</P>
<P>
   At the Tour Championship a few months later, Stewart should have
won, but he played badly down the stretch, lost a playoff to Tom
Kite, then neglected to shake hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``He overcame all that,'' said Chuck Cook, Stewart's swing coach
for nearly 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payne accomplished a lot of things this year, a lot of things
that had been hanging over his head, like not being able to finish
off a tournament. He cemented his reputation professionally.''
</P>
<P>
   He did that by winning at Pebble Beach earlier this year, then
silencing all the critics at Pinehurst. Stewart had won the US Open
in 1991, but people paid more attention to the fact that he had let
chances slip away in 1993 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   When he took a lead into the final round of this year's Open,
Stewart was setting himself for another disappointment. Or so most
of us thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard on television before that one of the detriments of
Payne Stewart's golf game is he's not that good a putter,'' said
Stewart. He flashed a smile as he talked in the Pinehurst media
room minutes after that now-famous 15-footer. ``Well, maybe I
squelched those rumors.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the process he had achieved another personal goal for
1999: He had made the Ryder Cup team for the fifth time.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Stewart was part of the US squad that defeated
Europe at The Country Club in Brookline in one of the most stirring
golf competitions ever staged. He did not play particularly well,
overshadowed by younger, more gifted players such as Tiger Woods
and David Duval.
</P>
<P>
   But with a circus atmosphere enveloping the matches, it was left
to Stewart to bring civility to it all. With the outcome of the
Ryder Cup decided, he conceded his match to Scotland's Colin
Montgomerie late in the competition, when unruly spectators were
feasting on the European. ``We won and he didn't need to go through
it,'' said Stewart. ``(The match) didn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   His gracious act did. It reminded all of us that the idea was
spirited competition, not just a test of golf skills.
</P>
<P>
   The lessons did not stop there. When he returned home, Stewart
with very little fanfare donated $500,000 to the First Baptist
Church in Orlando, where his children attend school and where
Chelsea, though just a seventh-grader, plays first base for the
school's varsity softball team. He then organized a party that
raised another $700,000.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 career victories that brought fame and fortune were
tributes to his golf talents, said Cook, but Tracey, Chelsea, and
Aaron were daily reminders of what was important in Stewart's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``His children were raising him religiously,'' said Cook. ``He
was doing a lot of things with them. He had been raised that way
and he got back in touch with that. That's what gave him a
peaceness, a calmness.''

HO-HUM. SLOW DAY AT THE OFFICE AS MAJOR INDEXES DECLINE 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stock prices weakened a bit Monday as traders in large
capitalization issues took some profits following last week's
bounce in major averages. Market interest rates, which moved higher
in the morning but later retreated and closed little changed,
provided another source of instability.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, however, traders said the session was an
unexceptional day at the office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very slow day,'' said Bill Allyn, head of listed
trading at Jeffries &AMP; Co. ``Barring some big outside event, I think
the market will stay in a trading range for the remainder of the
year. But one more interest rate increase before year-end could be
a negative.''
</P>
<P>
   Worries about higher interest rates, which could put a crimp in
future earnings, helped to drag down the Dow Jones industrial
average.
</P>
<P>
   Despite good earnings reports from a number of companies that
are included in the Dow, the blue-chip index fell 120.32, or 1.15
percent, to 10,349.93.
</P>
<P>
   American Express, Exxon and Chevron, which all reported
quarterly earnings that either met or exceeded Wall Street's
forecasts, fell by 2 points or more.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index slipped 8.02, or 0.62
percent, to 1,293.63, pulled down by weakness in oil, financial
service and drug stocks. The Nasdaq composite index barely budged,
dropping 0.57, to 2,815.95. Declines in issues like Intel and
Qualcomm were offset by big gains in Internet stocks like
Amazon.com and E-Bay. And the Russell 2000 index of small stocks
slipped 0.93, or 0.22 percent, to 417.76.
</P>
<P>
   Volume was light, and declining issues again outnumbered those
that gained in price.
</P>
<P>
   Richard McCabe, chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.,
said the fact that the broader market continued to fare poorly
suggested that additional declines might be in the offing soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rally we had last week was the weakest in terms of depth
and participation,'' he said. ``The Dow, the S&AMP;P 500 and the Nasdaq
were all up between 3 percent and 5 percent. Yet the
advance/decline figures for the week showed more declining issues
than advancing ones on all three exchanges. It's the same old
story: the big stocks rally and the rest of the market
languishes.''
</P>
<P>
   American Express and J.P. Morgan led the Dow lower.
</P>
<P>
   American Express fell 5\, to 143 ]. Traders sold the stock even
though the company reported that third-quarter earnings rose 14
percent, a performance that met consensus forecasts. J.P. Morgan
shed 5 7/16, to 120 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   Both stocks, along with other big financial service firms,
posted sharp gains last Friday after the Senate Banking Committee
reached agreement on legislation that would overhaul the financial
services industry.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon and Chevron both fell despite posting healthy earnings.
Other oil stocks fell in sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon lost 2~, to 74. Chevron fell 3}, to 90, even though its
earnings were better than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, MidAmerican Energy Holdings jumped 6[, to 33], after
Berkshire Hathaway said it was leading an investor group that would
buy the company for $35.05 a share. The transaction would be the
first energy purchase for Berkshire.
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks, which fell during the morning as long-term bond
yields touched 6.40 percent, rallied as long-term rates fell.
</P>
<P>
   Gains in stocks like Immunex, which rose 4[, to 58 1/16,
Amazon.com and E-Bay helped to push TheStreet.com's Internet sector
index up by 2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com gained 4[, to 82}. And E-Bay jumped 8\, to 150~.

1980, a Navy mechanic spent from two to five months in initial

CLINTON SIGNS ONE SPENDING BILL BUT VETOES ANOTHER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for rewriting throughout and to add new material; story is
complete in one take) (sw) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton signed into law a $268-billion
spending bill for the Pentagon on Monday, avoiding the risk of a
split among Democrats at the very moment that the parties are
speeding toward the end of their budget battle. At the same time,
he vetoed a separate spending bill for some other federal agencies,
assailing Republicans for making ``wrong choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton signed the Pentagon spending bill in part out of doubt
that Democrats could sustain a veto. The Pentagon bill was popular
and had originally passed the House by an overwhelming vote of
372-55.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the minority leader, had pledged
to fight vigorously to deliver the 146 Democratic votes needed to
sustain a veto. But other senior Democrats had expressed
reservations about a veto that could make them vulnerable to attack
on national security and were threatening to vote with the
Republicans against a veto.
</P>
<P>
   Signing the bill also allows Clinton and the Democrats to focus
attention on issues they are comfortable with _ such as education,
police and the environment _ rather than getting into a dispute
over national security.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton on Monday said that he could have prevailed on a veto
but that ``it would have been a close call.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes 13 annual spending bills to put the budget in place;
the president and Republicans are now struggling over five of the
bills.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Clinton signed the military spending package, his
remarks about the Pentagon bill were decidedly mixed. The president
criticized it for including budgetary gimmicks and pork-barrel
projects. But he said he had concluded that it contained crucial
elements, such as a 4.8 percent pay raise for the military. ``I
cannot allow our national security needs to be held hostage to this
budget battle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has struck a particularly combative tone over plans by
the Republican leaders in Congress to attach an across-the-board
spending cut, of up to 1.4 percent, to the year's final spending
bill. The move is a last effort by Republicans to put in place a
budget that does not touch Social Security reserves.
</P>
<P>
   The president contended that the across-the-board cut would lead
to layoffs in the military and harm education and environmental
programs, a charge that Republicans deny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not allow Congress to raise its own pay and fund its
pork-barrel projects and still make devastating cuts in everything
from education to child nutrition to the FBI,''Clinton said in
announcing that he had signed the Pentagon bill but vetoed a
measure funding the Commerce, State and Justice Departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not sign any budget that puts special interests above
the national interest,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The president's balancing act set the framework for the endgame
of the year's budget struggle, a fight whose outcome both parties
believe is likely to significantly influence the course of the
congressional elections in 2000, particularly in the narrowly
divided House.
</P>
<P>
   The final showdown could come as early as Friday, with the
expiration of legislation that temporarily has kept the government
running through the first weeks of the 2000 federal fiscal year
that began Oct. 1. Clinton said on Monday that he would sign
another stopgap bill to keep government operations running, but he
asked that Republican show good faith in negotiating a final deal.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders praised Clinton and tried to set him
apart from the House Democrats led by Gephardt , whom they accused
of wanting partisan confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has rejected the gridlock strategy of Dick
Gephardt,'' said Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the House majority whip.
Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader, said he
thought the president's action would make it ``that much easier''
to negotiate a compromise on the budget.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the president's decision to sign the Pentagon bill gave
the Republicans something they had wanted: a fight over a limited
number of bills, which scaled back the possibility that Clinton
could score big wins in negotiations over an omnibus spending
package, as has happened in his past confrontations with the
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   One of those is a $35 billion bill to pay for the Commerce,
Justice and State Departments, which the president vetoed on
Monday. He faulted the measure because it failed to provide money
for his goal of creating 50,000 new community police officers and
because it did not provide for dues and arrears to the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   While the Democrats have traditionally protected Social
Security, the Republicans this year have pledged that they will cut
spending without following the tradition in Congress of using some
of the Social Security reserves.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, they have to hold spending on the 13 bills to $592
billion. They say they will meet their goal with the
across-the-board spending cut. Republican leaders had announced
Friday the cut would be 1.4 percent, but key senators want it to be
smaller, and it was still being worked on on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans dismissed Clinton's assertion that the across-the
board reduction would mean cuts in programs and said they were
still increasing spending in some key education areas. ``That's
just demogoguery,'' DeLay said. ``It's about waste. You don't think
we can find enough waste in this place to find one percent?''

 &HT;    Florida friends of Stewart pay tribute to golf great

<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ In an All-American town with an apple-pie image,
he was a squeaky clean hero who gave money to his church and other
charities.
</P>
<P>
   In a sometimes smug sport filled with cookie-cutter stars, he
stood out for his attire, his demeanor and his sheer enthusiasm for
the game.
</P>
<P>
   In an age of snooty, greedy athletes surrounded by agents and
handlers, he was disarmingly genuine and generous, never too busy
to stop and spend a minute with every-day folks and fans.
</P>
<P>
   Such were the tributes being paid Monday to Payne Stewart as
word filtered around Central Florida that the 42-year-old PGA star
had died in the crash of a private jet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just so unbelievable for everyone in Orlando,'' said
Charles Davis, chairman of the National Car Rental Walt Disney
World Classic, a PGA event based in Orlando that just concluded
Sunday. ``We use that word, 'charisma' too often, but Payne really
had it. He was just a super guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who played his college golf at Southern Methodist
University in Texas, moved to Orlando some 20 years ago after
breaking into the ranks of the PGA tour.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn by Florida's year-round golf and a growing array of fine
new courses surrounding Orlando's vacation mecca, he quickly became
an anchor of the region's professional golf community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Team Orlando,'' as it has come to be called in recent years,
now includes such PGA luminaries as Tiger Woods, Mark O'Meara, Nick
Faldo and Scott Hoch.
</P>
<P>
   But while many stars with his success live insulated from the
public, Stewart seemed to be striving to be known as a regular guy.
</P>
<P>
   Active in his church, he was known for his generosity to
charities and his willingness to help his adopted hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved children, he loved to be that example for young
people, the kind of person they could look up to,'' said Orlando
Mayor Glenda Hood, who just two weeks ago presented Stewart with a
key to the city for his civic work.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart recently gave $500,000 to First Baptist Church of
Orlando. After winning the Bay Hill Invitational in 1987, he
donated his entire check to Florida Hospital in Orlando in memory
of his father, who had recently died.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart also was a regular at Orlando Magic basketball games,
and seemed widely respected and admired in the community.
</P>
<P>
   He lived west of downtown Orlando near Bay Hill, an exclusive
golf-and-residential development where tour legend Arnold Palmer
hosts an annual PGA event.
</P>
<P>
   After word about the crash reached the airwaves, a steady stream
of visitors drove down the wooded two-lane street to Stewart's home
Monday. A police officer was stationed outside the sprawling
estate's heavy iron gate. The home, hidden behind lush vegetation,
could not be seen from the street.
</P>
<P>
   Several local PGA players had participated in a charity event at
Bay Hill on Monday, and many left the course immediately upon
hearing of the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Tour pros Ernie Els, Mark O'Meara, Lee Janzen and Scott Hoch all
drove to the Stewart home to console Stewart's widow, Tracey. The
couple have two children, Chelsea, 13, and Aaron, 10.
</P>
<P>
   After missing the cut at the Disney tournament over the weekend,
Stewart reportedly used the free time to watch his son play in a
Pop Warner League football game.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's impact in Central Florida could be gauged by the
comments on Orlando's all-sports talk radio station, which was
filled with tributes from admiring fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were at the Disney Classic a couple of years ago and wanted
his autograph,'' said one fan who telephoned the program. ``He came
up to us and we didn't even have to ask. He rubbed my 5-year-old on
the head and said, 'How you doing?' ``
</P>
<P>
   Davis, the local tournament chairman, told the radio program
that Stewart was unfailingly polite and generous with his time _
something not universal in the world of high-paid, high-pressure
sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw Payne have a bad day,'' he said. ``If you needed
something, you could ask him and if he could do it, he would. There
was never any of this, 'Look at me, I'm the big star' attitude.''

( w/Chafee-obit)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Ronald Machtley had planned to introduce his friend
John Chafee Monday night at the New England Council's New Englander
of the Year award ceremony, but instead he ended up taking his
place.
</P>
<P>
   Before the gathering of regional political and business leaders,
who began the evening with a moment of silence in Chafee's honor,
Machtley read remarks that the senator had prepared before he
suddenly fell ill, recalling a man who, through all his years spent
in Washington, never lost the sense of belonging to New England.
</P>
<P>
   Machtley recalled Chafee's stubborn refusal to use his car's air
conditioning, which he felt was harmful to the environment. Former
governor William Weld remembered that Chafee never told him he had
been elected governor of Rhode Island _ he just cancelled their
regular squash game. And a long series of friends and associates
saluted him as a chronic muffler of his own achievements and the
best kind of Yankee public servant.
</P>
<P>
   ``As he saw other New Englanders like Bill Cohen leave, he had a
sense that this was still where consensus came from,'' said
Machtley, 51, a former Rhode Island congressman who is now
president of Bryant College in Smithfield, R.I. ``He talked about
how politics has become a little more strident, and how we in New
England have developed a philosophy of working together.''
</P>
<P>
   In his salute to the four-term Republican, who won admirers on
both sides of party lines, Machtley quoted Ralph Waldo Emerson's
description of ``men who by their sympathetic attractions carry
nations with them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1940s, Chafee's father had served as chairman of the New
England Council, and the senator was ``an obvious and unanimous
choice'' for the annual award, said the group's vice president,
Larry Zabar. The event was to be Chafee's first appearance since
his decision to end four decades in public office, Machtley said.
</P>
<P>
   Weld said Chafee's decision not to run for another term had
brought the senator a measure of relief. Chafee had been ``a little
frustrated with the welfare bill in 1994,'' and was ready to return
to family life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't tired of the game, he wasn't tired of the people,
but he he had become a little bit tired over the last couple of
years,'' Weld said.

PAKISTAN MILITARY SAYS 7 CIVILIANS WILL JOIN NEW GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (With PAKISTAN-MUSHARRAF, PAKISTAN-SHARIF) 
 (af)  
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, _ The military announced Monday night the
names of seven civilians who will join the government of Gen.
Pervez Musharraf, the army chief who seized power on Oct. 12 and
ousted Pakistan's elected government.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the civilians were appointed to the cabinet, and four
to the National Security Council, the country's highest
decision-making body under the new military-led administration. Two
of the civilians appointed to the seven-member council _ which will
be headed by Musharraf, and include the chiefs of the navy and the
air service _ were closely associated with previous military
dictators.
</P>
<P>
   The military released only a bare list of the general's choices,
with no resumes attached, after the general left the country Monday
morning to visit Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The
announcement set off a scramble by journalists to figure out who
some of the lesser-known appointees were.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best-known choices was Sharfuddin Pirzada, a
constitutional lawyer selected as senior adviser to the general and
ex-officio member of the council. Pirzada was attorney general in
the 1980s under a military ruler, Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, and
served as law minister in the military government of Field Marshal
Mohammad Ayub Khan in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Pirzadais best known for having drafted a constitutional
amendment on Zia's behalf that allowed the indirectly elected
president to dismiss the directly elected prime minister and
dissolve parliament. This vestige of military dictatorship was only
done away with after Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister who was
toppled this month, was elected in a landslide in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Attiya Inayatullah, the only woman among those appointed to the
council, had also served Zia, advising him on population control
programs. She was formerly a representative to UNESCO.
</P>
<P>
   The other two members of the council are Imtiaz Sahibzada, a
career civil servant from the Northwest Frontier Provinces, and
Muhammad Yaqub, who has been governor of the State Bank of Pakistan
since 1993 and is said to be acceptable to the International
Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   That is an important consideration for military leaders, who
need to persuade the IMF to continue lending money to Pakistan,
which is close to defaulting on its international debts.
</P>
<P>
   The cabinet appointments include Abdul Sattar, who had served as
the top civil servant in the Foreign Ministry and will now be the
foreign minister. Shauhat Aziz, a banker, will be finance minister,
and Aziz Munshi was made attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf announced in a speech a week ago that he would set up
a National Security Council to govern the nation.

 &HT;    Fee in smuggler case used for comparison
 &HT;    By Jenny Staletovich
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Assistant U.S. Attorney Marie DeMarco grilled F.
Lee Bailey for a third day Monday, showing that once angered, the
government can be a relentless foe.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to force Bailey to repay $2 million by proving he knew it
was tainted when he took it as a legal fee for representing
infomercial king William J. McCorkle, DeMarco zeroed in on Bailey's
past conduct in a separate case involving a similar dispute with
the government over fees.
</P>
<P>
   DeMarco, 34 and about four months pregnant, has gone toe to toe
with Bailey, whose celebrated career began before she was born.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination, Bailey has repeatedly challenged and
corrected the prosecutor, who's been in her job for three years.
The two have sparred over legal tactics, the semantics of an
answer, interpretations of law and ethics. At times, DeMarco has
clearly annoyed Bailey; other times she has invoked a kind of
sarcastic respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I believe you're a highly organized person,'' he responded
at one point last week when she searched to verify a point in the
mounds of documents stacked around her.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he chided her like a child: ``No, no and no.''
</P>
<P>
   DeMarco handles general criminal cases and is assigned to the
office's asset forfeiture division. She was pulled into the
McCorkle case to oversee the forfeiture aspect, but became so
well-acquainted with the details that her supervisor made her
co-counsel. Before joining the U.S. attorney's Orlando office, she
practiced privately in Tampa for five years, where she successfully
sued Fred Astaire Dance Studios for scamming elderly women
customers.
</P>
<P>
   DeMarco raised Bailey's ire Monday when she focused on his
conduct in the case of French marijuana smuggler Claude Duboc.
</P>
<P>
   As payment in the case, Bailey said he made a deal with the
government to accept $3 million in pharmaceutical stock and help
prosecutors obtain the rest of Duboc's fortune. The government
contends Bailey was only given the stock to hold and was supposed
to use it to manage property. When Bailey refused to surrender it
after the value jumped upwards of $20 million, U.S. District Judge
Maurice Paul jailed him for 44 days. Bailey eventually turned it
over and dropped his claim. He is now suing for $10.6 million in
the U.S. Court of Federal Claims in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The case also led to an investigation by the Florida Bar, which
last week sent a seven-count ethics complaint to the Florida
Supreme Court. A hearing will be held sometime in the next six
months in Fort Myers.
</P>
<P>
   DeMarco, who clerked for Paul several years before the Duboc
case, asked Bailey again and again if he improperly paid himself
about $3 million after selling off some of the stock. Bailey said
he only used the stock to secure a loan.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he said, ``there was never a forfeiture until (the
government) learned the stock had gone up and then it was suddenly
forfeitable.'' Likewise, he has argued the government never warned
him it was going to pursue his legal fee in the McCorkle case.
</P>
<P>
   DeMarco's cross-examination resumes today.

THE BASEBALL WORLD ACCORDING TO BUD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While major league baseball has been on an upswing in
recent times, its commissioner, Bud Selig, admits there are
ominously distinct boundaries that now exist in the sport between
the wealthy, big-market franchises and those ensconced in small
locales.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt we have a serious disparity problem, and that
it has to be addressed,'' Selig told me the other day during an
interview. ``It's something I've been working hard on since taking
over this job five years ago. I understand the problem very well,
since the team I have owned, the Milwaukee Brewers, is in a small
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons I named that blue-ribbon task force with
people like George Will and George Mitchell and Richard Levin
(president of Yale) on it is to see what ideas it can come up with.
We're working very hard to solve our problems, and we're doing more
revenue sharing now among the teams than ever existed in the past.
But it's still not enough. There's still too great a disparity
between the rich teams and those with limited finances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball was a sport that had its head in the sand for too
long. It never seriously attempted to solve its problems, and acted
as though they didn't exist. At least we're trying now to do
something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   By the sheerest coincidence, eight of the teams that appeared in
the postseason ranked among the top 12 payrolls in the sport, with
the Yankees holding the top spot with their staggering $86,426.992
payroll and with the Houston Astros having the most modest playoff
payroll at a paltry $51,629.000.
</P>
<P>
   It's not exactly startling that the Yankees have qualified for
another World Series, with their owner, George Steinbrenner,
willing to give staggering salaries to such prime performers as
Bernie Williams ($9,857.143), Roger Clemens ($8,250.000), David
Cone ($8,000,000), Paul O'Neill ($6,250,000), Chuck Knoblauch
($6,000,000), Andy Pettitte ($5,950,000), Scott Brosius
($5,250,000), Derek Jeter ($5,000,000), Chili Davis ($4,333,333),
Tino Martinez ($4,300,000) and Mariano Rivera ($4,250,000).
</P>
<P>
   Even the journeyman catcher, Joe Girardi, commands wages of $3.4
million and the seldom-used outfielder, Chad Curtis, earns $2
million. Only seven of the Yankees' 25 players make less than $1
million, with utility infielder Clay Bellinger and, curiously,
Darryl Strawberry the lowest at a bread-and-water $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Braves, who list their payroll at $62,652,500, are
cheapskates. Only nine of their players makes less than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   They're actually near the $80 million level themselves, but
three of their players, Andres Galarraga ($8,250,000), Javier Lopez
($5,250,000) and Kerry Lightenberg ($255,000), aren't being counted
because they are on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   It's now apparent that a team must make a huge financial
investment in order to make it into the October test matches.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego Padres went on a spending spree last season, and
it resulted in a World Series appearance. The Florida Marlins did
the same in 1997, and they went on to win a world championship.
</P>
<P>
   But both small-market teams wound up dripping in red ink, and
were forced to get rid of many of their high-priced personnel. And
both immediately dropped out of playoff contention.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as the Dodgers, whose payroll soared to $79,265,953 in
the wake of their seven-year, $105 million payoff to Kevin Brown,
and Angels, whose payroll went up to $51,830,166 after signing Mo
Vaughn, found out the past season, throwing large amounts of money
around doesn't exactly guarantee success on the field.
</P>
<P>
   But one does wonder if the World Series will become an exclusive
enclave for the game's affluent like the Yankees and Braves?
</P>
<P>
   Will the have-nots like the Pittsburgh Pirates, Minnesota Twins,
Milwaukee Brewers, Kansas City Royals, Oakland A's, San Francisco
Giants, Montreal Expos and the rest never make it to the Fall
Classic in the 21st century?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that doesn't happen because, on the long term, it will
hurt the game,'' said Selig.
</P>
<P>
   The game at the moment has become a warm commodity.
</P>
<P>
   Its television ratings have been up more than 20 percent. Its
regular season attendance once again topped 70 million. Its
playoffs provided riveting daily drama. Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa,
Ken Griffey Jr., Pedro Martinez, Nomar Garciaparra, Tony Gwynn,
Alex Rodriguez, Derek Jeter and Manny Ramirez dispensed Hall of
Fame heroics.
</P>
<P>
   And it even has the glamorous World Series it wanted between the
Yankees and Braves, although it hasn't yet lived up to
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game never has been more popular than it is right now,''
said Selig. ``We've attained levels we never dreamed we could
reach. There's been a Renaissance in this sport that's been
incredible. Some of the on-field performances of our star players
continue to be amazing. And the playoffs were spell-binding.''
</P>
<P>
   Bud Selig has had his critics since taking over from the ousted
Fay Vincent in September of 1992, and they were braying loudly
during the sport's disastrous labor dispute in 1994 that led to
Selig's cancellation of the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   But baseball has made a remarkable comeback since that dark
year, and Selig played a vital role in the owners and players
unions finally reaching a peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   He also was responsible for adding a third division in each
league, an extra tier of playoffs and a wild card entrant.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people said that the wild card was going to ruin the
sanctity of the game,'' said Selig. ``But I think just the opposite
has happened. A lot of teams who would be hopelessly out of the
playoffs in September now have a chance to make it because of the
wild card. I think the wild card has created tremendous interest
among a lot of fans who otherwise would be indifferent.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig is downsizing his own office, or, as he puts it, unifying
it.
</P>
<P>
   There won't be an NL or AL president after this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of wasteful redundancy that just had to be
eliminated,'' he said. ``And now we plan to have all the umpires
answering to one person in our office. It's unfortunate we had to
go through the umpire problem this summer, and, hopefully, we can
all work together from now on.''
</P>
<P>
   There are vexing other dilemmas confronting Bud Selig like the
perennial Pete Rose Hall of Fame question.
</P>
<P>
   ``The late commissioner, Bart Giamatti, made his decision on
Pete Rose 10 years ago and I still stand by it,'' said Selig,
referring to Giamatti putting Rose on baseball's ineligibility
list. ``I don't think anything has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   That's unfortunate because a vast majority of baseball patrons
feel the game's most prolific batsman belongs in the Cooperstown
shrine, notwithstanding his gambling indiscretions.
</P>
<P>
   For certain, a lot has changed in baseball since Bud Selig
assumed command and most of it has been positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of what we've achieved,'' said Selig. ``I feel we've
been moving in the right direction. My father used to tell to tell
me all the time that you can judge whether something is going good
or bad is by comparison to the past. And, if you compare with the
way baseball is going now to its past, I'd have to say it's going
quite good. . .''

   (NYT20) NEW YORK -- Oct. 25, 1999 -- COLUMBIA-EDUC, 10-25 --
Columbia University President George Rupp in his office last week.
The university, which during the 1970's and '80's was struggling
with a declining reputation and declining gifts from its alumni,
has edged out Yale as the third-most selective Ivy League college,
after Harvard and Princeton. Rupp, Columbia's
preacher-turned-president, who served as dean of Harvard's Divinity
School and president of Rice University before joining Columbia in
1993, has proved to be a decisive manager and a thoughtful
strategist as well as a tireless fundraiser, many Columbia insiders
say. (Nancy Siesel/New York Times Photo)

training of enlisted mechanics for the Navy, in his office. In

better work force, shaped through on-the job training. (Skip

menopause. (Andrea Mohin/New York Times Photo)

Chicago, now Boeing Precision Gears, to manufacture the gears like
this SPECO part number 145D6301. (Skip Peterson/Dayton Daily News

ADVERTISING COLUMN: FOR ONLINE ITEMS, THE LETTER `Z' IS POPULAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last letter of the alphabet is becoming the last word, as it
were, in names.
</P>
<P>
   Using a ``z'' at the end of a name _ often in place of the ``s''
that would be there to indicate the plural form _ is growing
increasingly popular in advertising, marketing and the media. There
is a lengthening list of products, services, agencies, Internet
companies and the like that are being named as if Zorro had been
the brand identity consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Examples include Beenz, an online currency; Fritos Racerz, snack
chips shaped like race cars; Adaptz.com, a Web site aimed at
consumers who are disabled; the Lugz and Pure Playaz lines of
footwear and apparel; the animated film ``Antz''; Poweradz.com, a
network of Internet portals based on community newspapers; the Boyz
Channel and the Girlz Channel, cable television networks, and
Flooz.com, a Web site offering online gift certificates.
</P>
<P>
   Those zooming into view with names ending in ``z'' give various
explanations for the eye- and ear-catching practice.
</P>
<P>
   One obvious reason is the rise of hip-hop culture, derived from
rap music and the life styles prevalent in urban America. The film
``Boyz N the Hood'' (1991) was an early influence. Many rap artists
use the letter ``z'' at the end of their names or the names of
their groups: Heavy D. and the Boyz, Jay-Z, Lost Boyz, Youngbloodz,
Ghetto Twiinz, Hoodlumz and Peter Gunz.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought the `z' would be really cool for the urban
market,'' said Larry Schwartz, executive vice president at JSSI in
New York, the company that sells Lugz, which are advertised by
Amster Yard in New York, part of the McCann-Erickson Worldwide
Advertising unit of the Interpublic Group of Cos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw fashion changing from sneakers to boots and in fact,
many rappers were starting to wear boots,'' Schwartz said. ``And
the kids were starting to take their cues from the rappers.''
</P>
<P>
   The thinking, then, is that a name that finishes in ``z'' will
be evocative of the hip image, contemporary attitude and
cutting-edge trendiness that pervade hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be in style, to be in fashion, just add a `z,''' said Doug
Raboy, managing partner for creative at Hanft Byrne Raboy &AMP;
Partners in New York, the agency for Flooz.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ralph and Tommy get it all from the `hood,''' he added,
referring to the designers Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger, whose
clothing first blew up _ gained success _ in the inner cities
before being adopted by suburban shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Raboy was quick to note, however, that the founders of Flooz.com
named their Web site ``after the slang for cash used in ancient
Mesopotamian trading markets, predating the gold card by 5,000
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``z'' is also supposed to connote an alternate way of
looking at life, in much the same manner that rap is an alternate
form of music.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our movie, our lead character, Z, was somebody who thought
differently, who did things his own way,'' said Brad Lewis, one of
three producers of ``Antz,'' the 1998 animated movie released by
Dreamworks SKG and PDI.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the `z' at the end of `Antz' is a perfect parallel,'' he
added, ``directly analogous.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Frito-Lay division of Pepsico Inc., which introduced
Fritos Racerz in July, the name of the snack-chip brand _ the first
variation in Fritos shapes since 1932 _ was derived from consumer
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we talked, we found that the `z' makes it fun, modern,
fitting with the fast, active theme we intended,'' said Stephen
Quinn, vice president and marketing general manager at Frito-Lay in
Plano, Tex.
</P>
<P>
   That was particularly true with younger consumers, he added,
which was serendipitous because Fritos Racerz is aimed at snackers
between the ages of 8 and 12.
</P>
<P>
   Such appeal o important to the Fox Family Channels in
introducing the Boyz Channel and the Girlz Channel, which are
obviously meant for youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids get it,'' said Rich Cronin, president and chief executive
at the Fox Kids Network unit of the News Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept is crystal clear,'' he added: ``quirky, different,
a lot of personality. After all, if Liza were Lisa, would anyone
care?''
</P>
<P>
   Cronin's query brought up the antecedents to the ``z'' trend,
which include the singer Liza Minnelli; ZZZZ Best, pronounced
``Four Z Best,'' a carpet cleaning company that became one of the
best-known financial swindles of the 1980's; the cars sold by
Datsun, now Nissan Motor, like the 240Z, and ``Beanz meanz Heinz,''
a slogan created by the London office of Young &AMP; Rubicam that was
long familiar from British ads for H.J. Heinz.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Z' is an underappreciated letter,'' said Glenn Jasper,
corporate communications director for the Beenz Co. in New York,
which is introducing Beenz as a redeemable currency that computer
users can obtain by visiting Web sites and participating in
Internet promotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our founder, Charles Cohen, finds the `s' to be a dull
letter,'' Jasper said, ``and the `z' _ or `zed' as he calls it,
since he's British _ is his favorite letter.''
</P>
<P>
   Using a ``z'' to replace an ``s'' can also help a name stand out
for legal purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `z' makes the name proprietary and protectable,'' said
Quinn of Frito-Lay, meaning that the company could obtain a
trademark for Fritos Racerz. That might not have been the case if
the name had been the generic Racers.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes a ``z'' is just a ``z.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could tell you there's some deeply insightful
reason'' for the name Adaptz.com, said David Brenner, president of
the Web site in New York, a unit of Disabilitysource.com that
recently signed Barnesandnoble.com and the Dodge division of
DaimlerChrysler as initial sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an icon, something to help remember the Web site,'' he
added. ``I didn't think `Adapt.com' had the same zing.''
</P>
<P>
   What trend is next after ``z'' ends a name? Of course, the
opposite. For instance, there's Zwirl.com, a planned E-commerce Web
site where Jessica Adelson calls herself ``ZEO,'' and
Zuniversity.com, which offers students Web sites and e-mail
affiliated with their universities.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Z' is a very powerful and confident letter,'' said Joe Wolf,
co-founder of Zuniversity.com in Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Sez who?
</P>
<P>
   ``A relative who's into beads and crystals,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Well, as the saying goes, always consider your sourcez. &QL;

HONG KONG BEGINS SELLING ITS STOCK PORTFOLIO 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ When Hong Kong's government plunged into the stock
market in August 1998, buying $15 billion worth of shares, it drew
ridicule from some rather lofty sources. Milton Friedman, the Nobel
Prize-winning economist, called the intervention a ``crazy idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, more than a year after its famous shopping spree, the
government began offering those shares to the public. Whether Hong
Kong is deemed crazy or clever will depend on how many investors
buy them.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the government announced a target price of $1.3
billion for the first batch of shares, packaged in a fund that
tracks Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng index. To entice local
investors, it is offering a minimum 5 percent discount on the
market price of the stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities are promoting what is called the Tracker Fund of
Hong Kong with an advertising campaign that features a father
cavorting with his children against the backdrop of a soaring
suspension bridge. The black-and-white ads are rather austere, and
officials here have projected a similarly subdued tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government didn't want to buy these shares,'' said Peter
Churchouse, the managing director and co-head of research here at
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Asia. ``They painted themselves into a
corner by doing it, and they're trying to get out of it
gracefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its steep cost, officials here contend that the
intervention was a success because it foiled foreign-currency
traders who had been seeking to weaken the stock market and the
Hong Kong dollar. Officials also note that the value of the
government's portfolio has risen by more than $10 billion, to $25.8
billion, amid the resurgence in Asian stock markets.
</P>
<P>
   But that, of course, is a paper profit. Realizing those gains
will be another matter. And selling such a vast portfolio without
depressing the rest of the market is a challenge not lost on anyone
in this city, where the daily closing price of the Hang Seng index
sometimes seems to be the only box score that counts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be a lot more supply out there than the
market can bear,'' said Mac Overton, a financial consultant at the
Sun Hung Kai Trading Company, one of Hong Kong's largest property
developers.
</P>
<P>
   Given that the government has said it intends to dispose of most
of the $25 billion portfolio, analysts said Hong Kong investors
could expect offerings of $2 billion every year for the next
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, at least, they did not seem too concerned by that
prospect. The Hang Seng index rose 1.33 percent. Analysts said the
market was propelled by increases in two of its largest stocks, Sun
Hung Kai and HSBC Holdings, rather than a warm reception for the
Tracker Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Always on the lookout for a money-making opportunity, Hong Kong
residents lined up at banks Monday to collect applications for the
offering. But just how wide the appeal of the fund will be is the
subject of some debate here.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Machin of Goldman, Sachs, which is coordinating the
offering along with ING Barings and Jardine Fleming, said it would
be attractive to retail investors because of the discount and
because of bonus shares that will be awarded to those who hold the
stock longer than a year.
</P>
<P>
   But Churchouse noted that index funds and mutual funds have
never been popular here, because investors enjoy picking stocks and
trading them almost as a sport. ``People in Hong Kong like to punt
the market,'' he said, using a British term for making speculative
trades.
</P>
<P>
   Institutional investors also prefer buying individual stocks to
funds, Churchouse said. But he added that the Tracker Fund would be
an easy way for fund managers to increase the Asian weightings of
their portfolios. The government will give institutions a discount
as well, though its amount has not been fixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't unadulterated enthusiasm for the Hong Kong
market,'' he said. ``But slowly, we're seeing money flow back.''
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts said they were skeptical about the Tracker Fund
because, like the index it tracks, the fund is heavily weighted
toward banking and property stocks. Together, HSBC, which is based
in London, Sun Hung Kai and another big property developer, Cheung
Kong Holdings, account for more than half the total market
capitalization of the Hang Seng index.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's attractive,'' said Marc Faber, the head of
his own investment firm here. ``Property shares aren't performing
well. Even after its decline, Hong Kong property is still the most
expensive in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, analysts said, the Tracker Fund is a bet on the
future of Hong Kong itself. After contracting by 5.1 percent last
year, the territory's economy is in the midst of a surprisingly
vigorous recovery. But it still trails Asian nations like South
Korea, Singapore and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors also cannot get past the intervention itself,
which they view as a betrayal of Hong Kong's free-market
principles.
</P>
<P>
   ``They shouldn't have bought the shares in the first place,''
Faber said. ``Or if they bought them, they should have sold them
sooner.''

 RULER Of PAKISTAN DESCRIBED AS `SECULAR-MINDED' MUSLIM  
(See also PAKISTAN-SHARIF) 
(js) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ The Chicago anesthesiologist picked up his
morning newspaper and read a headline that roiled him. ``Pakistan
Wakes Up to a Dictator,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan was the doctor's native country, and it was his
brother, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who was being called a dictator.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Naved Musharraf said the true villain was Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif, who was booted out in the Oct. 12 military coup. And
the doctor was also upset that news accounts suggested that his
brother, the army chief of staff who had appointed himself
Pakistan's chief executive, was an anti-Western fundamentalist
Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   Far from it, the doctor said in a telephone interview. The
general's only son, he said, works as an actuary in Boston for the
state of Massachusetts. Musharraf himself is a U.S. citizen who has
lived in Chicago for 25 years, ever since his medical residency at
Cook County Hospital. As for religion, the Musharrafs are faithful,
though hardly the most observant of Muslims, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pervez is a secular-minded man,'' Musharraf said of his
brother. ``He believes in the separation of church and state. He
doesn't want a theocracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversations with the general's brother, friends and colleagues
provide some of the first clues about the elusive army commander
who now rules a nation of 150 million people that came near to
all-out war this summer with its neighbor, India, while he was army
chief.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Both India and Pakistan conducted underground nuclear tests a
year and a half ago, heightening the world's concern about their
conflict with each other and itical stability of Pakistan, a
country plagued by epic corruption and tottering on the brink of
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the two weeks since the armed forces took power, Musharraf,
56, has made only carefully scripted appearances and given no news
conferences. His army-sanctioned biography is a single-page,
double-spaced listing of his steady climb through the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   But those who know the general personally, as well as military
officers and defense experts, describe him as a liberal Muslim and
a level-headed military commander whose commitment to democratic
rule cracked when Sharif meddled once too often in the military's
business by trying to get rid of a second army chief within a year.
</P>
<P>
   While a head of state's decision to impose his will on the
military would not be considered justification for a coup in most
democracies, Sharif is widely blamed here for bringing ruin on
himself by toying with a potent military that has ruled Pakistan
for 25 of its 52 years and that remained the real power behind the
scenes even when democracy was ostensibly in place.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't interfere in the spheres that are strictly army,''
said Brig. Rashid Qureshi, who served as Musharraf's chief of staff
when he was a corps commander in the mid-1990s, referring to
internal army promotions.
</P>
<P>
   In an address to the nation a week ago, Musharraf praised
freedom of speech, promised a crackdown on corruption, and appealed
to religious clerics to discourage the exploitation of religion for
sectarian and political ends.
</P>
<P>
   But while he has put forth a domestic political agenda that
seems like a campaign platform for good governance and made a
pledge to tolerate dissent that is still untested, he is almost
certain to be hawkish on relations with India.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Like other military officers, Musharraf sees India as a threat
to Pakistan's security and views Pakistan's dispute with India over
control of the Himalayan territory of Kashmir as central to the
army's nationalistic role, friends and colleagues say. He believes
that predominantly Muslim Kashmir must be allowed to choose whether
to join the Islamic state of Pakistan or remain part of largely
Hindu India.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's aware that Kashmir is an irreducible, inescapable
issue,'' said Javed Jabbar, a friend of the general's who has been
involved in unofficial peace efforts between India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Kashmir dispute has its origins in the partition of
India and Pakistan in the dissolution of British India in 1947, so
Musharraf's own identity was forged in the Hindu-Muslim
bloodletting that followed.
</P>
<P>
   The Musharrafs lived in the old Indian city of Delhi, but fled
to Pakistan just days before the two new nations gained their
independence. Pervez Musharraf was then 4. His parents told their
three sons that the family had been on the last train to make it
safely to Pakistan. Muslim passengers on the trains after them were
massacred by Hindus and Sikhs, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a very traumatic time in my parents' lives,''
Musharraf said. ``It's seared into their memories. That's why they
don't like India. They kept saying we couldn't trust Hindus and all
that.''

</P>
<P>
   The boys' father, Syed, had been a civil servant under the
British and went on to work for the Pakistani government,
eventually joining the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   In Karachi, the boys attended a Roman Catholic high school.
Though no one in the family had served in the military, young
Pervez decided to become a soldier, his brother said. He was an
adequate student, but thrived on football, cricket and body
building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes he used to get physical with me,'' Musharraf
recalled. ``I remember him as a disciplinarian. He used to impose
his will on me. He made me study and participate in sports, and if
I didn't, he'd get angry with me.''
</P>
<P>
   After attending a Christian college in Lahore, Pervez Musharraf
joined the army. He did stints as an artillery gunner and commando
and rose through the ranks, serving with distinction in the 1965
and 1971 wars with India. His son, Bilal, was named for a close
friend who died in the 1971 war.
</P>
<P>
   Just a year ago, it seemed that Gen. Musharraf's career had
reached its highest pinnacle, as army chief of staff. His
predecessor as army chief had quit after proposing a greater role
for the military in civilian affairs _ an approach Sharif rejected.
</P>
<P>
   But the seeds of mistrust between the general and the prime
minister were sown at the start. Sharif gave him only a one-year
appointment instead of the usual three, a probationary period that
the general found demeaning, said his friend Jabbar.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf's patience was further strained when Sharif had the
army take the blame for the country's disastrous military venture
in Kashmir last summer, which led to a dangerous, 10-week conflict
with India and then an ignominious pullout of Pakistan-backed
forces.
</P>
<P>
   When India's defense minister, George Fernandes, said Sharif had
been kept in the dark about the army's activities in Kashmir,
Sharif did not challenge the statement _ outraging military
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not a babe in the woods,'' Jabbar said. ``He was very
much part of the decision-making process.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Sharif abruptly went to Washington and agreed to call for
the pullout without the blessing of the military, turning what the
generals had seen as a military triumph into a bitter humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went off and signed the Washington accord without
developing a minimum level of consensus,'' said Shireen Mazari, a
defense expert who has known the general since early in his career.
``You can't do things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was Sharif's decision to fire Musharraf while the army
chief was on a commercial flight, cut off from his troops, that
pushed the general and his top commanders to seize power, army
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf has now set out an extraordinarily ambitious program
for himself, one that critics warn could prove difficult if not
impossible to carry out _ and that could lead to a very long period
of military rule if the general insists on staying in power until
he succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   As the months go by, he is likely to start feeling more pressure
for the restoration of democracy. In past military coups, the
euphoria and passivity that initially greeted the generals
eventually faded, said Samina Ahmed, a political scientist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Military rulers believed that they had been accorded domestic
legitimacy only to be faced with popular demands for representative
rule from the Pakistani people, who are basically democratic at
heart, bless them,'' she said. ``And then the fur started flying.
Why should it be different this time?''
</P>
<P>
   Even the general's brother worries about his holding on to power
too long. He figures that it will take two to three years for his
brother to do what he needs to do. He said he plans to advise him:
``Look, don't overstay and end up like previous martial law
governments. They were thrown out by the people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If he carries out the promises he's given, I'll be happy,''
Dr. Musharraf said. ``If he becomes corrupted by power, I'll be
uncomfortable. I hope he does his job, holds elections and gets
out.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENTIAT, Wash. _ In one way, the news this year from Bruce Grim's
orchard, and from orchards all over this region that proudly calls
itself the Apple Capital of the World, is very good news indeed.
``Vintage!'' Grim proclaimed as he plucked a red Delicious from a
tree and sliced it open with a pocketknife. ``Lots of crunch. Lots
of snap.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Great internals,'' he said, referring to the flavor and
texture. ``Terrific external, too,'' he added, appraising the
color.
</P>
<P>
   But wide agreement about the outstanding quality of this year's
crop in the nation's top apple-producing state belies a disturbing
trend: no one here seems to be making any money growing apples.
</P>
<P>
   For the last several years, growers here have had to deal with
some of their worst times ever, a result of stagnation in domestic
demand, grocery-industry consolidation that gives large buyers the
upper hand in negotiating price, and a flood of imports from China
that has driven the price of apples used in making juice so low
that last year many farmers, rather than picking all their product,
simply let some of it rot in the orchard.
</P>
<P>
   That the nation's economy is roaring along in so many other
respects only makes the plight of those who grow this most American
of fruits all the more frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep reading about the big economic boom in Seattle,'' 150
miles to the west, on the other side of the Cascade Mountains, said
Grant Daniel, a grower just across the Columbia River from Grim.
``Well, there's no boom going on out here on these orchards.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year the state's apple growers saw their lowest return in
three decades, with the typical family orchard, of 50 acres, losing
between $70,000 and $100,000, according to the Washington Growers
Clearing House Association, an industry group. The association says
that 20 percent of the state's growers have gone out of business in
the last five years and that another 20 percent, or 800 orchards,
will do so over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have financed this year's crop on the credit
card,'' said Kirk Mayer, the association's manager. ``They're
basically trying to buy their orchard all over again from the bank.
But it's a very uphill proposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington State grows about half of all the nation's apples,
followed by New York and Michigan, with about 10 percent each.
Growers of all apple varieties in those states and elsewhere around
the country received an average of 17.1 cents a pound for their
product last year, 18 to 29 percent less than in the three years
before and, after adjustment for inflation, one of the lowest
prices since the Great Depression, said Kraig Naasz, president of
the U.S. Apple Association, a national trade group.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in prices for juice apples, generally of lower
quality than apples marketed for eating, has been even more stark.
Having averaged $189 a ton in 1995, those prices have dropped
consistently since then, to an average of $40 a ton last year; many
growers around here say they got as little as $10 a ton.
</P>
<P>
   The apple association, arguing that ``a flood of cheap
apple-juice concentrate imports from China is drowning much of our
industry in a sea of red ink,'' filed a petition earlier this year
with the United States Department of Commerce and the government's
International Trade Commission. The association argued that China,
now the largest apple producer in the world, was dumping its
product _ that is, deliberately undercutting American apples by
selling at below-cost prices _ and sought punitive tariffs on the
United States' Chinese apple-juice imports. A decision is expected
later this fall.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, though, many growers here have either given up
or say they are on the verge of going broke. Many say, too, that
they are particularly angry that even as the prices they receive
have plunged in recent years, the cost to the consumer has actually
inched upward slightly over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   It is not at all hard to understand just why that is happening.
Consolidation in the grocery industry, for one thing, has clearly
given an advantage to the buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have over 100 suppliers in the state of Washington
alone competing for the business of five major buyers,'' Naasz
said, ``it's easy to see who has the leverage in those price
negotiations, and it isn't the apple grower.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the growers themselves are necessarily immune from
responsibility for their plight. For one thing, they may simply
have planted too many trees in recent decades, especially those
that bear the benchmark red Delicious apple, still the No. 1 seller
in the grocery store but typically so plentiful that it fetches a
lower price than many other varieties.
</P>
<P>
   Now some growers here, in a frenzied bid to carve out their
place in ``niche markets,'' are ripping Delicious trees out of
their orchards and experimenting with exotic varieties that many
people find far superior in taste and quality. And other growers
are completely abandoning a fruit that long provided them a
livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think apples are a thing of the past,'' said George Kapral,
who has been growing them for 49 years. His 40-acre orchard once
bore almost nothing but apples, but he has ripped out so many apple
trees over the years in favor of pear that the share for apples is
now down to 4 acres; next year, it will be 2.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that American consumption of apples has
leveled off at around 20 pounds a person per year (compared with 35
pounds in Canada and 50 pounds in parts of Europe).
</P>
<P>
   ``The competition is greater than ever before for a share of the
customer's stomach,'' Naasz said. ``There are all kinds of snacks
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Some food critics say demand has flattened because apples simply
do not taste as good as they once did. The red Delicious, in
particular, they say, has been bred over the years for color and
size uniformity, and has lost some of its flavor in the process.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Washington growers, trying to stimulate demand,
have imposed a variety of fees on themselves for a promotional
campaign to persuade Americans to eat an extra apple a day.
</P>
<P>
   The weather here this year _ warm, but not too warm during the
day, cool at night, with just the right amount of rain _ has
combined with the area's rich volcanic soil to turn out a crop of
ideal quality, although one that is expected to be a bit smaller
than last year's. Taken together, those factors could lead to
better prices as the apples come in at warehouses this fall, said
Mayer, of the Washington Growers Clearing House Association. But,
he said, it will take more than one good season to make up for the
punishingly low returns of recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Grim, who lost $63,000 last year growing apples on his 90 acres
of orchards, said many suppliers felt particularly frustrated
because they grew up in a time when big families made a fine living
working orchards much smaller.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that a family could raise their kids, send them
to school, have a good life in this community, growing on 10 to 15
acres,'' said Grim, a third-generation grower. ``Well, now I'm
farming about seven or eight of those, and I'm not making any money
at all.''

SPORTS COLUMN: PAYNE STEWART, A GOLFER WITH STYLE AND CLASS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With PLANE-STEWART) 
(ms) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until Monday, until his Lear jet's strange and spooky crash,
Payne Stewart's life had never been better. He had won his second
U.S. Open with a 15-foot par putt on the 18th green at Pinehurst
No. 2 in June, and he was on the American team that snatched the
Ryder Cup from the European pros in a Sunday comeback last month at
The Country Club outside Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important, for someone who admitted he had been rude
and arrogant occasionally in his younger years, the 42-year-old
golfer had grown into a gentleman.
</P>
<P>
   As the only touring pro who wore plus fours, Payne Stewart
always had style; when he wore long pants, nobody recognized him.
But this year he showed he also had class.
</P>
<P>
   When Stewart, a father of two, won the Open at Pinehurst, he
turned to Phil Mickelson, the runner-up who had been waiting all
week for word that his wife, Amy, had gone into labor with their
first child.
</P>
<P>
   ``You and Amy,'' he said, holding Mickelson's face in his hands,
``you take good care of your baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart later talked about how he had been able to control his
emotions on that winning putt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud that my faith in God is so much stronger and I'm so
much more at peace with myself than I've ever been in my life,'' he
said. ``That's why I was able to gather myself and conduct myself.
That gave me the strength to stand up there and believe in myself
and get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   And on the 18th green in his Ryder Cup singles match, Stewart
turned to Colin Montgomerie, the Scot whom too many Americans seem
to love to hate. By then the American team had clinched, so Stewart
conceded Montgomerie's putt, thereby giving the Europeans another
half-point. ``Colin didn't deserve to have to stand over this putt
and try to make it,'' Stewart later explained. ``We had already won
the Ryder Cup; that's what it is, a team event. My individual
statistics don't mean anything in the Ryder Cup, and I wasn't going
to put him through that.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially after the heckling that Montgomerie had been through
that day and the two previous days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had numerous instances of heckling in the gallery; we had a
couple of people removed from the gallery,'' Stewart continued,
referring to their singles match. ``I appreciate the gallery that
we had here, but it's a golf event for pride and honor. You have to
understand that it's not life and death. Some of our fans, they're
a little bit over the top. I don't know how many of them have been
to golf events before.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the fifth fairway, I said: `Colin, if you have a problem, I
will take care of it. This is not what it's about. Some of our fans
are out of control and not appropriate.' I told him that I would
have security or whatever take care of it because this was a
competition between Colin and myself and all of us as a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going to let the fans be out of control and influence
one of his shots because of the heckling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he respected that from me. And all I can say to Colin
is: `I'm sorry for some of our fans. It wasn't right that they
behaved that way, but that's how it is.' And he said, `Well, I'm
kind of used to it.' And I said, `If you want me to do anything,
I'll take care of it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Payne Stewart didn't have to do that, but he did.
</P>
<P>
   In the years to come, he'll be remembered for what he did when
everybody in golf watched: winning three majors _ the Open this
year at Pinehurst No. 2 and also in 1991 at Hazeltine outside
Minneapolis as well as the 1989 Professional Golfers' Association
Championship at Kemper Lakes outside Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   But he also should be remembered for what he did when nobody was
watching: offering to help control the heckling and then conceding
Montgomerie's birdie putt on the 18th green.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't lward to running after the elusive dollar,''
Stewart said after winning the Open at Pinehurst. ``I'm looking
forward to, as soon as the tournament in Valderrama is over, the
seventh of November; I'm not playing again until the Hawaiian Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had so much fun being at home, being a father, getting up in
the morning, making breakfast, taking my kids to school, going to
high school athletics. That's what my life is right now, so I'm not
going to do what I did in '91 along that line.''
</P>
<P>
   But suddenly and sadly, Payne Stewart's life, which had never
been better, is now over.

GIANTS LOSE 4 MORE PLAYERS TO INJURIES, WEAKENING DEPTH CHART 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The Giants won the game Sunday but lost
a running back, two safeties and a defensive tackle, a situation
that had Coach Jim Fassel scrambling to find stand-ins _ however
unpolished _ for the Sunday's game in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   During the Giants' 31-3 blowout of the New Orleans Saints, the
starting safety Percy Ellsworth broke the cuboid bone in his left
foot, and four plays later, his backup, Shaun Williams, pulled his
left hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the team said that Ellsworth and Williams would be out a
month. So there is a chance the starting free safety for the Giants
against the Eagles will be Brandon Sanders, who had been cast off
two teams this year, the 0-7 Cleveland Browns and the Giants.
Sanders arrives with an undistinguished record. When the Giants
signed him this past summer, they released him a day later.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, whom the Giants expect to sign after a workout Tuesday
morning, had been with the team the past two seasons and was used
almost exclusively as a special-teams player, having never started
a National Football League game. He was taken by Cleveland in the
expansion draft last spring and released by the team in August.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders may seem like a last-resort starter, but the Giants have
few other alternatives. If the strained hamstring of safety Lyle
West, a rookie drafted in the sixth round, does not improve
quickly, the Giants' choices will be down to Sanders or Jeremy
Lincoln, a cornerback who last played safety 13 years ago as a
16-year-old high school senior in Toledo, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   West hasn't practiced for the past two weeks. Monday, Fassel
said he wasn't convinced that West could practice this week.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel, who gave his players time off until Wednesday, said he
would most likely sign two safeties this week. A team official
indicated the team would work out Sanders and Tre Thomas, a rookie
safety the Giants also cut at the end of training camp. Thomas
would probably be signed to the practice squad, providing the
Giants with some insurance against another injury to a safety.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of Williams will also affect the Giants' nickel and
dime pass defenses. The rookie cornerback Andre Weathers will have
to take Williams' place in the nickel, and another rookie
cornerback, Bashir Levingston, who was signed primarily as a
kickoff specialist, will have to play in the dime package.
</P>
<P>
   Free safety is not the only place the Giants will be short this
weekend, it is only the most glaring deficiency. Defensive tackle
Robert Harris broke his fibula and sprained his right ankle on
Sunday and will also miss a month of playing time.
</P>
<P>
   With Christian Peter at tackle, the Giants are deep at that
position.
</P>
<P>
   But the Giants also lost running back Joe Montgomery, who broke
a bone in his left foot against the Saints while making his Giants
debut. Fassel said Monday that he didn't know when Montgomery hurt
his foot but that the rookie would be out three to four weeks.

BUSINESS SEEKS A BIGGER ROLE IN CAMPAIGN FOR CONGRESS  
 (EXCLUSIVE) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Chamber of Commerce will step up its
assistance to congressional candidates that it considers friendly
to business in an effort to counter the growing political influence
of organized labor and other liberal groups, the chamber's
president said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The chamber, the nation's largest business organization, plans
to select 35 House races and a dozen Senate races in which it feels
it can tip the balance. The group would then deploy campaign
contributions, advertising support and its grass-roots organization
to help elect its preferred candidates, most of whom are sure to be
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas J. Donohue, the chamber's president, said the group would
spend at least $100,000 in each race, for a total of nearly $5
million.
</P>
<P>
   The total is a fraction of the $40 million that the AFL-CIO
plans to spend this year and next to benefit candidates supported
by organized labor, almost all of them Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But it comes at a time when the Republican leadership in
Congress is growing more aggressive in soliciting campaign money
from companies and business lobbyists to maintain the party's
fund-raising advantage over the Democrats. The chamber's goal is to
concentrate on a relative handful of close races where even a small
amount of money or help in getting out the vote could make a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be more aggressive if we expect people to support
us on issues important to the business community,'' Donohue said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the AFL-CIO said the chamber was simply reacting to
labor's success in recent years. The business group, they said,
does not have the same close ties to its members that unions enjoy
and does not have the field organization that labor has built to
communicate with union members and get them to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm curious to see how the Chamber of Commerce and other
business groups are really able to mobilize voters,'' said Steve
Rosenthal, the AFL-CIO's political director.
</P>
<P>
   Business has never been monolithic in its approach to politics.
Small and medium-size businesses _ the chamber's main constituency
_ tend to be owned by people who strongly back conservative
positions on issues like taxes, limiting lawsuits and reducing
government regulation. While not as visible as big corporations,
small business has tremendous influence among Republicans,
particularly in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Large companies tend to be less ideological than small business
owners, and although they favor Republicans over all, they also
give substantial support to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, business groups in Washington have long felt that
their influence was diffuse compared with that of the labor unions,
which have grown increasingly aggressive in supporting Democrats in
House and Senate races, especially since the Republicans gained
control of Congress in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Donohue, who vowed to make the chamber more of a force in
Washington when he took over at the organization two years ago,
said business groups faced ideological competition not just from
unions, but from groups like environmentalists and trial lawyers
that raise and contribute large sums to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   To help raise money for its political action committee and its
own campaign operations, the chamber has hired Ted Welch, one of
the Republican Party's most respected fund-raisers and former
finance chairman for Lamar Alexander's unsuccessful presidential
bid. Welch said most of his effort would be focused on the
entrepreneurs who own and run the three million businesses
affiliated with the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Donohue said the chamber had not yet settled on which races it
would concentrate. He said the group would probably back a few
moderate and conservative Democrats, including Rep. Charles W.
Stenholm of Texas, who faces a tough race from a Republican
challenger.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the candidates it chooses to back will be
Republicans. On Wednesday, chamber officials plan to meet with
George V. Allen, the former governor of Virginia, who is expected
to seek the Senate seat held by Charles S. Robb, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Donohue said other likely recipients of the chamber's aid would
be three incumbent Republican senators who face tough re-election
fights: Spencer Abraham of Michigan, John Ashcroft of Missouri and
Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Donohue said the chamber wanted to retain as much flexibility as
possible to be able to identify tight races where it might be able
to make a difference in the weeks leading up to Election Day next
year. To do that, he said, the chamber would have to resist
pressure from Republicans to spread money and logistical help among
large numbers of candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in an emergency room, and this is triage,'' Donohue
said. ``We're going to pick the patients who are going to live.''

IT'S UP TO A QUEASY GLAVINE TO STOP THE YANKEES 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tom Glavine is the first in the last line of defense
for the Atlanta Braves in this World Series, and over the past two
days, his manager asked the pitcher repeatedly if he has had enough
time to recover from a stomach virus, if he would be ready to pitch
in Game 3 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine says he is. He also says his diet currently consists of
soup and crackers, that he has lost weight, and he has no idea how
many innings he will last.
</P>
<P>
   For better or worse, the gritty Glavine will take the ball at
Yankee Stadium and try to stop the pinstriped avalanche that is
threatening to bury the Braves in the last World Series of the
century. Andy Pettitte will pitch for the Yankees, who established
dominance in winning the first two games in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' success has been based on their strong starting
pitching throughout this decade, and any comeback would have to be
built on the former Cy Young award winners Glavine and John Smoltz,
who is scheduled to start Game 4 Wednesday night. ``Any team that
has good pitching like we have,'' Cox said, ``we can always reel
off three in a row. We've always been able to do something like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankee Manager Joe Torre said: ``When you win as many games as
they have, they go out there tomorrow night and they're going to be
confident they could beat our brains out. They're going to look for
pitches to hit, be aggressive, and that's what they do best.''
</P>
<P>
   And worst. It became apparent in the first two games of the
Series that the Yankees' pitchers are employing essentially the
same strategy they did against Texas _ another team composed of
aggressive hitters _ in the division series. Orlando Hernandez and
David Cone, the Yankees' starters in Games 1 and 2, threw strikes
with breaking balls early in the ball-strike count, before
successfully tempting the Atlanta hitters to swing at bad pitches
late in the ball-strike count. Generally, Cone said, the Yankees'
pitchers have been advised in scouting meetings that the Atlanta
hitters _ dangerous as they might be _ are capable of hacking far
beyond the limits of the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been devastating. ``They couldn't be better,''
Cox said, when asked about the Yankees' starters.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees lost the first two games of the 1996 World Series at
home, as the Braves did this year, and after the Yankees came back
and won, Torre mentioned that despite the two losses early in the
Series, he still felt confident his team would prevail; he had a
sense it was ready to rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Braves' workout Monday, Cox explained calmly that
Atlanta has recovered from predicaments before and he believes it
can again. But if he has the same feelings as Torre had in '96,
they exist irrespective of what occurred in Atlanta over the
weekend. The Braves accumulated three errors and four hits in the
first 17 innings of the series, batted .121 over all and botched
pivotal fielding plays. The Game 2 starter, Kevin Millwood, took
the mound with benign stuff and in the one instance when a reliever
pitched in a crucial situation, John Rocker imploded.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brosius tried to describe the collective frame of mind the
Yankees are playing with now, and there were echoes of 1998, when
sometimes it was as if the Yankees were playing solitaire with a
deck of 51. ``We're just concentrating on coming out and playing
the games, and trying to do whatever is required with each at-bat,
each inning, each situation,'' Brosius said. ``We don't worry about
the historical stuff. We just come out and play the games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have won 10 consecutive World Series games, a streak
that began with Game 3 of the 1996 World Series, and a streak that
is two games shy of the record of 12 consecutive victories, set by
the Yankees when they won the World Series in 1927, 1928 and 1932.
Should the Yankees win the next two games and sweep the Braves,
they would be the first team since the Yankees of 1927-28 to sweep
the World Series in back-to-back seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night's starters, Pettitte and Glavine, are similar:
left-handers who like to throw repeatedly to the outside corner
against right-handed batters, Pettitte with sinking fastballs and
curveballs and Glavine with changeups and fastballs.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Rippley, scheduled to be the home-plate umpire tonight,
will call balls and strikes and could have a significant impact on
the approach of both pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   If he's calling strikes on the pitches thrown just off the
absolute fringes of the strike zone, the conditions will favor the
pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine had been scheduled to pitch Game 1 of the World Series,
but on the eve of the Series, he came down with a stomach virus and
was replaced by Greg Maddux. There was no chance he could have
pitched in Game 2, either, Glavine said, and he has spent the past
few days recovering, assuring Cox he would be fine for Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how my stamina's going to be, to be quite honest
with you,'' Glavine said. ``I think that if it was a summertime
game and was going to be 100 degrees, I'd be a whole lot more
concerned about it than I would be tomorrow, when it's going to be
cool. That obviously will help a whole lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing in the American League stadium, the teams will employ
designated hitters _ an advantage for the Yankees, according to
Cox. Chili Davis will probably start at dh for the Yankees, but
Torre was weighing the possibility of starting Jim Leyritz.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Hernandez, acquired from the Cubs during the season, will
be the designated hitter for the Braves. The right-handed-hitting
Chad Curtis will start in left field for the Yankees although he
has gone without a hit in 13 career at-bats against Glavine. Luis
Sojo, who missed Games 1 and 2 following the death of his father,
Ambrosio Sojo, is expected to be in uniform and available for
Tuesday night's game. &QL;

CITY TO MAKE HOMELESS WORK FOR SHELTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NINA BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the first time, the homeless in New York City
will be required to work as a condition of shelter under a policy
to be put into effect by the administration of Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani before the end of the year, an administration official
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The work requirement is one of a list of rules that those
seeking shelter will have to obey to keep their beds under the
city's plan, which makes the city's homeless shelters subject to
the same system of eligibility screenings, job searches, work
assignments and sanctions that city welfare offices have used since
1995 to move more than 400,000 people off public assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The homeless who are able to work and who fail to comply with
the rules could be refused shelter, and in the case of families
with children, the children could be put in foster care, said
Anthony Coles, the senior advisor to Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, the city is asking parents to take responsibility
for themselves and to take responsibility for their children,''
Coles said. ``But if parents are unable to take responsibility for
themselves, then it raises a real question of whether they can take
responsibility for their children.''
</P>
<P>
   The requirements are backed by state social services regulations
issued in 1997 and aimed at moving the homeless to work and
self-sufficiency. But the rules were not immediately applied in the
city because of legal challenges by advocates for the homeless
based on court rulings 18 years ago that gave the homeless a
far-reaching right to shelter. The advocates objected that the new
rules threatened to send hundreds of homeless children and adults
onto the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Last February, after an appellate court ruled against the
advocates' objections as they applied to families with children,
city officials said they were making preparations for the shift in
policy, but had set no firm starting date. Until last week,
advocates for the homeless and many private, nonprofit shelter
providers believed that any change would be delayed until after the
cold season, which typically brings a peak in shelter applicants.
</P>
<P>
   But Coles said the administration was ready to apply the new
rules to 4,600 families in the city's homeless-shelter system in 45
to 60 days, and that it expected to be legally free to do the same
for the system's 7,000 single adults within the same period.
</P>
<P>
   At a court hearing on Thursday, city lawyers will officially
notify lawyers for homeless single adults of their intentions and
draw up a briefing schedule, Coles said.
</P>
<P>
   Under current welfare procedures, those seeking exemption from
work requirements because of mental or physical disabilities must
undergo screening every three months by a medical service under
contract to the city. Advocates for the mentally ill have
com that this process is impossible for many disabled
applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents in the city's homeless shelters already work in
exchange for their welfare benefits while their children are in
shelter day care, according to Frederick Shack, the president of an
organization of 42 nonprofit agencies running family shelters under
contract to the city. But at any one time, 10 percent have been
mistakenly cited for noncompliance with welfare rules, he said, and
many others arrive with their public assistance cases wrongly
closed.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current system, their shelter is not threatened by
such case closings. But under the state regulations the city is
applying, shelters are required to evict those no longer eligible
for public assistance.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear exactly how or when such a decision would be made.
Debra Sproles, a spokeswoman for the city's Human Resources
Administration, said details on when the homeless would be ejected
were still being worked out.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Among the most controversial issues is whether children can or
should be taken into foster care if their parents _ in most cases,
a single mother _ are expelled from the shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Banks, legal counsel to the Coalition for the Homeless,
maintained that to do so violates a longstanding state social
services law and court rulings that children should not be removed
from their families for lack of housing alone.
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas Crane, the assistant corporation counsel handling the
right-to-shelter litigation for the city, said: ``In some cases, if
it got to that _ and hopefully it wouldn't _ failure to comply with
various regulations could result in children being taken away
because the mother's actions would be tantamount to neglect.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Scoppetta, the commissioner of the city's
Administration for Children's Services, said the issues would be
examined case by case, and that in some instances relatives might
be able to care for the children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our only concern would be are the children safe: Are they
being cared for, are they being provided for?'' he said. ``My only
concern is you don't have somebody go out in the street with two
young children and say, `Well, all right, I have to live in the
street now.' We wouldn't let two young children live in the
street.''
</P>
<P>
   Another unanswered question is how the new regulations would
affect Department of Homeless Services outreach teams, which try to
persuade homeless people living on the streets to enter the shelter
system. Under current welfare rules, people can be barred from
re &UR; - &LR; applying for assistance for up to 180 days. It was unclear
whether the same waiting period would keep the homeless from
re-entering a shelter.
</P>
<P>
   The city's workfare program _ by far the largest in the country
with about 40,000 participants _ requires welfare recipients to
work at city jobs, including cleaning parks and doing clerical
tasks, in exchange for their benefits. Under current welfare rules,
single adults who miss a single hour of work can see their entire
case closed. Last year 69 percent of these home-relief clients in
the work program were sanctioned and removed from the rolls for
several months at least, city records show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extraordinarily callous, with the cold weather coming
now, that the city wants to put vulnerable New Yorkers on the
streets,'' Banks said. ``The track record of workfare programs in
the city hasn't been one in which significant numbers were placed
in jobs that allowed them to pay prevailing rents. It has been
essentially a tool to reduce the caseload through sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
   But Coles dismissed such concerns. ``There are always advocates
invested in the old ways of doing things who are going to posit
extreme scenarios for what will happen,'' he said. ``The mayor has
shown time and time again that attaching social responsibilities to
social programs makes for a better and stronger city, it makes for
better and stronger families and for better and stronger
individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   The effects of welfare cutbacks on homeless shelters in the rest
of the country are indirect because most shelter systems are
supported by a patchwork of private charities and limited public
financing, and residents enjoy no legal right to shelter. No other
city in the nation has as comprehensive a publicly financed shelter
system as New York's.

CHALLENGES HAVE ADDED DEPTH TO TORRE'S PERSPECTIVE ON LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Joe Torre peers at sunsets as if he were watching
them for the first time. He recognizes the vibrant flowers he never
bothered to look at before, absorbing their beauty. He sees bright
stars on dark, clear nights, studying them more than staring at
them. Things change.
</P>
<P>
   Every hug with Ali, Torre's wife, includes an extra squeeze. If
Andrea Rae, their 3{-year-old daughter, eats an ice cream cone
sloppily and then kisses him, Torre revels in the sticky smooch and
returns the kiss again and again. These moments are precious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tease him, because he notices the little things more,'' Ali
Torre said. ``Now he takes time to stop and reflect.''
</P>
<P>
   Cancer will do that. It is a frightening disease that never
truly goes away. The fear of losing what one has can bring new
appreciation for what one has. Remember to savor life. Torre has
admitted that he does this even more now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more sensitive to everything around me on a daily basis,''
Torre said. ``I'm more aware of things.''
</P>
<P>
   With New York buzzing about baseball, and the Yankees needing
just two victories to secure their second straight World Series and
third in four years under Torre, it is easy to overlook how this
special season started.
</P>
<P>
   Prostate cancer. Manager Joe Torre has prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the words the Yankees heard in spring training when
events like Tuesday night's Game 3 of the World Series were distant
and seemed unimportant in light of their manager's health. The
Yankees wanted to know that Torre would be fine, that the manager
whose soothing approach had guided them would survive. They were
worried about Torre's health, about his ability to continue as a
father and husband, not about losing a manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know if this day would ever come,'' said Torre,
referring to the World Series. ``You don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre was outside the visiting clubhouse at Turner Field in
Atlanta, wearing a thick Yankee jacket to protect him from the
swirling winds. He looked weary, but Torre, who is 59, has often
said he has the kind of worn face and brooding brown eyes that make
him look as if he were always tired. It was 90 minutes before the
Yankees overwhelmed the Braves, 7-2, in Game 2 and Torre was wiping
tears away.
</P>
<P>
   He playfully chided a reporter for asking questions that made
him cry. But Torre cried anyway, another sign of his increased
sensitivity. It was a question about how his relationship with
Andrea Rae was strengthened while he missed more than two months of
the season that caused Torre to take his left hand out of his
pocket and rub his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, your first thought is to be alive, to be alive for
my little girl,'' Torre said, his voice wavering. ``So many good
things have happened to me. If nothing good ever happened again,
I'd have a lifetime of great memories. But, with my little girl,
that makes the need to live longer more apparent and more important
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali giggled like a proud mother when she was asked how Torre
entertained their daughter while he was recuperating. ``He did
whatever she wanted him to do,'' Ali said.
</P>
<P>
   That meant watching ``Scooby Doo'' in the morning and switching
to the ``Peter Pan'' videotape when the cartoon was over. Torre
brought Andrea Rae to arts and crafts class on Tuesdays, dipping
his fingers in paint like any other parent and taking her for a
bagel afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always self-conscious of going places because of who I
was, but I became a father,'' Torre said. ``I was oblivious to
everything else that was going on around me.''
</P>
<P>
   When Torre talked about the preventive treatment he will undergo
after the season, his voice naturally sounded more concerned. He
has adopted a strict low-fat diet, works out strenuously five times
a week, drinks green tea for its antioxidants and has leaner muscle
mass on his 212-pound frame. But like other cancer patients, Torre
worries. ``You never know,'' he said. ``This thing could come
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Torre underwent surgery at the Barnes-Jewish Hospital in
St. Louis seven months ago, he told his surgeon, Dr. William
Catalona, that he would invite him to the World Series if the
Yankees made it. Catalona, who was in the dugout with Torre before
Game 1, said Torre looked terrific and was probably in better shape
now than he was before surgery. Still, the hospital estimated that
179,000 men would get prostate cancer this year and that 37,000 of
them would die.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is always a chance that any type of cancer can
reoccur,'' Catalona said. ``That's why all cancer patients have to
come back for checkups.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Torre, Joe's older brother, who had a heart transplant
three years ago, said: ``He went from being on top of the world to
a life-and-death situation in 24 hours. No matter what Joe tells
you, there's always a little doubt with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre and his wife pray often and remain positive. Her
79-year-old father had surgery for prostate cancer 12 years ago and
has had no recurrence. So whenever Torre received a worrisome
medical report or felt sick, Ali reminded herself about her father
and prayed harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear of cancer and you think of death,'' Ali said.
``That's until you research it, learn more about it and realize
people can survive.''
</P>
<P>
   After Torre guided the Yankees to the 1996 World Series title,
Ali wanted him to retire. They never really discussed retirement
while he was recovering this spring and she rarely mentions it
anymore, because she has a deeper understanding of how happy Torre
is when he is managing. This year, it means more. Things change.
Moments are precious. Torre knows it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, if I find that I'm in a stressful time, I'll use
what I have been through to relax me,'' he said. ``I'll tell myself
that I'm lucky to be here, so, whatever happens, win or lose, I'm
fortunate. Believe me, I'm lucky.'' &QL;

BRAVES' WILLIAMS PONDERS YANKEE TIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The question made Gerald Williams raise his head and
open his eyes wide. Then he chuckled.
</P>
<P>
   Would Yankee Stadium have an intimidating effect on his team,
the way it seems to have on some visiting baseball players?
</P>
<P>
   ``Intimidated?'' said Williams, the left fielder and leadoff
hitter for the Atlanta Braves. ``I used to play here. I like the
atmosphere. This is a place where the fans are very involved. They
have a lot of energy and a lot of spirit. They embrace baseball.
It's a fine situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it should have a positive effect on people who want to
play baseball. I like the atmosphere here. You think and you feel
that you are in the right spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the change of scene will do some good for Williams and
the Braves, who worked out briefly at Yankee Stadium Monday after
dropping the first two games of the World Series in Atlanta over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Tuesday night's game, Williams is 0 for 8 and his
teammates have only seven hits among them.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees will have vocal crowd support and would presumably
benefit from the switch to the American League rule allowing the
use of the designated hitter. But Williams, a Yankee from 1992
through 1996, dismisses thoughts of a home-field edge for the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at anything as excuses or an advantage,''
Williams said. ``I look at productivity. We've had a lack of
production. What we have to do is stack some hits together and come
out with a victory.''
</P>
<P>
   At 33 years old, Williams has been around long enough to make
many friends in baseball, but few are closer than two Yankees who
are stars of the defending champions: shortstop Derek Jeter and
center fielder Bernie Williams.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Gerald Williams, Jeter first shrugged and said
he had nothing to say. Then he began to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gerald's like a big brother,'' said Jeter, who is is eight
years younger. ``He really took care of me from the time I was 18,
my first spring training. He went out of his way to look after me
and give me advice. He took me out to eat. Right from the start,
when I was still in the minor leagues, he was nice. He talked to
me. First spring training, you're sort of wide-eyed, looking at all
the players. Gerald is the one guy who went out of his way to make
me feel comfortable. Even to this day, he lives in Tampa, and we
hang out every day in the off season. He's somebody I go to for a
lot of advice.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the hall, in the visitors' clubhouse, Williams recalled the
teen-age Jeter as ``making the transition from the minor leagues to
the major leagues, and he had a lot of questions that he wanted
answered.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams added: ``I tried to answer them as best I could. Our
personalities are similar. We got along very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Bernie Williams, Gerald Williams said people
sometimes assume that they are related because they have similar
personalities and the same last name. He described Bernie Williams
as ``a very good person first, which is consistent with a lot of
guys that I have a certain kind of connection with.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It's most important to be a very good person first
because if you are not, who cares what the professional is? You can
only play so long. But you will be a person for the rest of your
life. Indeed, Bernie and I have a lot of history. We are very good
friends. But, right now, Bernie's up 2-0, so friendship is out the
window, right?''
</P>
<P>
   With the Braves in the regular season, Williams batted .275 with
17 home runs and 68 runs batted in. For his career, Williams is at
.263 with 55 home runs and 240 rbi Williams was traded from New
York to Milwaukee during the 1996 season and came to Atlanta before
the 1998 season. That year, he batted a career-best .305.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter said he is glad that his friend has found a regular role.
``I couldn't be happier,'' Jeter said. ``A lot of times in this
game, you get labeled early on in your career. He was always
labeled as a fourth outfielder who never really got a chance. He's
got all five tools and he can play. And when he's been given the
opportunity, he's doing an outstanding job.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the post-season, Williams is batting only .222 with no
home runs and four rbi. He has only two walks in 54 trips to the
plate, not what would be expected as a leadoff hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Cox, manager of the Braves, said Williams ``plays a big
role'' and implied that it will be crucial to the fortunes of the
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't had many hits in the past six or seven games,'' Cox
said, ``but he can get hot at any time.''

NBC'S GRAY SAYS HE WAS TRYING TO LET ROSE `MOVE FORWARD' 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A day after his contentious interview with Pete Rose
before Game 2 of the World Series on Sunday night, NBC reporter Jim
Gray defended his tough questioning of Rose about whether he would
admit to gambling on baseball in order to be reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to be fair and give Pete a chance to move
forward,'' he said, adding that Rose had earlier that day answered
similar questions from the news media and could not have been
surprised by Gray's questions.
</P>
<P>
   Rose described the interview as a ``prosecutor's brief.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray said that he didn't believe his style was aggressive or his
tone antagonistic. ``Not with the responses I was getting and the
questions I was being asked by Pete,'' he said. ``I thought it was
very fair. I wasn't aggravated. I didn't have an agenda.'' But, he
added: ``Replaying it in my mind, one could see how that may be the
impression of somebody. There was no intentional act of
belligerence.''
</P>
<P>
   The interview loosed a wave of critical phone calls to NBC's
headquarters and its affiliated stations and e-mails to the NBC
Sports Web site at MSNBC.com.
</P>
<P>
   Gray made one concession to angry fans. ``Last evening, as
always, I was trying to do my job to the best of my ability,'' he
said. ``If the fans felt that the interview went on too long,
particularly on a night of special celebration, then I'm sorry for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray's interview was praised by John Dowd, whose investigation
into Rose's gambling led to the player's exile, and by Fay Vincent,
the former baseball commissioner who was Bart Giamatti's deputy at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tip my hat to Jim Gray,'' Dowd, who compiled a 225-page
report on Rose's gambling, told The Associated Press. ``I thought
he had more guts than any guy I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Vincent said that Rose ``continues to say such absurd things as,
`show me the evidence.' Since Gray really knows the story, he knows
the evidence is all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray said he had no intention of interviewing anyone beside
Rose, who was one of 18 members of the 30-man all-century team that
was introduced before the game. Rose received the longest and
loudest ovation of any team member.
</P>
<P>
   NBC went straight to the Rose interview after the ceremony,
which produced a weird shift from a happy moment to an unusually
tough pregame conversation. Gray said he did not want to ask a
standard question about what it was like to stand beside Johnny
Bench or Ted Williams in the limited time he had.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an outpouring of fan support for him and I thought
at this time and moment, with him on a field for the first time in
10 years, he might have taken the chance'' to show contrition and
admit to gambling on baseball, Gray said. As he had before, Rose
refused to admit that he had bet on baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Gray thought it was ``possible'' that Rose might make the
confession. ``Was it realistic to expect it?'' he said. ``Much more
realistic than at any time in the past 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Gray said, Rose wasn't visibly angry. ``He just said
he knew it was going to be all about gambling,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said no players, including the Yankees Paul O'Neill and Jim
Leyritz, who publicly criticized the interview, confronted him at
Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of guys said something, but nothing exceptional, or
anything to be concerned about,'' he said. ``It seemed to be
innocuous.''
</P>
<P>
   On the plane back to New York Sunday night and again at the
Yankee Stadium clubhouse Monday, however, Yankee players talked
about the possibility of boycotting Gray for the rest of the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Ebersol, the chairman of NBC Sports, said, ``I find a
boycott unimaginable. People have too much respect for Jim. And the
Yankees are too professional for that.'' &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: KNOBLAUCH WON'T LET DEMONS WIN 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The solid single on an 0-2 fastball that Chuck
Knoblauch remembered being ``up and in'' was almost lost in the
machine-gun fire of hits that followed. Someone had to make first
contact against Kevin Millwood, though. Someone had to send the
comforting message to the Yankee dugout Sunday night that Millwood
would not be blowing smoke on what became a very chilly World
Series night for Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about getting that leadoff guy on,'' Joe
Girardi said Monday in the warmth of the confident Yankees
clubhouse. ``In a big game like that, it's what ignites the emotion
to reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the battleground that is Knoblauch's psyche, there have
been dueling post-season realities, but indications that one side
is advancing. One side is winning. It is the part of Knoblauch that
refuses to surrender to the virus in the communications linkup
between brain and arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be the first to admit that I've had trouble with my
throwing,'' the second baseman said. ``But no one's going to stop
me from going out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Courage is an overused word in sports, and trauma sounds trite
on the morning after an airplane crash tragically defines true
loss. Yet in the context of human imperfection examined through the
lens of the national television cameras, there is something
wonderfully stubborn about Knoblauch's insistence that no one will
eventually remember how his throws _ those delicately floated and
painfully aimed _ reached first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have to roll it over there, I'll do it,'' he said. ``And
in the book, all it'll say is 4-3.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been so much said about Knoblauch's throwing
dysfunction, and not enough credit for the way he has, especially
in the post-season, made the best of a bad situation. How he has
found a way to improvise, in the way the Yankees find ways to win.
Frame by frame, the network breaks down his startlingly flawed
mechanics. Inning by inning, Knoblauch survives, two games from
another title.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have scrutinized him, derided him, will have to kiss
his ring when he gets it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe Morgan's the worst, and I hope you print that,'' Knoblauch
said Monday, defiant to a fault. ``I think he forgets that he
played the game once. Go back, check his records and see if he was
perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, the NBC analyst and Hall of Fame second baseman, has a
job. So does Knoblauch. Beyond the breakdowns, Knoblauch's and
Morgan's, is a penetrating cynicism in sports that borders on
intolerance for those who are suffering, but not from the more
easily comprehended, more conventional, torn rotator cuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've heard of other guys who have gone through stuff like
that,'' Scott Brosius said. ``But anything you're dealing with,
you've got to deal with head on. There's no place to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   There are several ways of retreating, of quitting, without
actually disappearing. When he might have gone into a defensive
shell, Knoblauch has been present and accountable at the top of Joe
Torre's lineup. His first-inning hit in Game 2 on Sunday night
began a three-run rally. His eighth-inning sacrifice bunt between
Greg Maddux and Brian Hunter in Game 1 left the Braves in an
inescapable mess.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Knoblauch's opposite in the Braves' lineup, Gerald
Williams, is 0 for two games. ``There's offense, there's base
running, there's taking pitches,'' Knoblauch said. ``All people
want to talk about is the throwing.''
</P>
<P>
   His throwing, not the balls fired wildly by Texas infielders, or
Boston's, or Atlanta's. Granted, Knoblauch's problem is
tantalizing, mystifying. Everyone has an opinion, a suggestion. If
Knoblauch had asked, I would have told him to concentrate on moving
his feet, and let his right arm do what it instinctively knows to
do. A tennis instructor once told me to try that on those awful
days when I have somehow forgotten how to hit a forehand, my best
stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch wasn't seeking advice from any weekend hacker, or
anyone else. Not right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell him to fire it, over my head, if he has to,'' Tino
Martinez said. ``Why he doesn't, I don't know. I just don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not the time to try to figure this all out. Knoblauch is
in the middle of the Yankees' infield, in the middle of a World
Series. He still snaps off a strong throw _ like the pivot on
Sunday's fifth-inning double play _ when there is not time to think
and his feet are properly aligned to throw.
</P>
<P>
   On all other plays, he is, figuratively, just trying to wing it.
Just trying to win. A year ago in the playoffs, he was assailed for
not chasing an errant throw, and deserved it. Not now. Now he
deserves no ridicule, just respect. &QL;

   Intensified talks in Belfast to break the impasse that has

guarded expressions of hope for a breakthrough this week when
former Sen. George J. Mitchell returns to finish his formal review.
An Ulster Unionist negotiator, Alan McFarland, said, ``There is a

they declared a cease-fire 13 months ago. Her arrest came a day
after the rebels announced tougher demands for resuming the stalled
peace talks, insisting that Madrid must first agree to Basque
self-determination and the withdrawal of all state security forces
from the region. The government dismissed the initiative as

 &HT;    Pettitte thrust intospotlight after season of trade rumors
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Andy Pettitte gets his turn now, not that there's any
bargain in that.
</P>
<P>
   After Orlando Hernandez and David Cone held Atlanta to just two
hits in 14 World Series innings, Pettitte starts tonight and, yes,
the numbers make him a little uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I went more than five innings without giving up
more than one hit in may career,'' he said. ``Yeah, that's not too
much of a concern when I'm trying to follow those two acts.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the Yankees cannot recall exactly why the team did not
trade Pettitte away last summer (or the summer before that), this
should be a refresher. It is the postseason and there are worse
things than having Pettitte on the mound. He is uncertain about the
best game he's ever thrown, but it was either last week in the
ALCS-clinching Game 5 against Boston or his work in Game 5 of the
1996 World Series in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the starters, when we were talking with one another, we
knew if we were going to win this thing, it would be our
pitching,'' Pettitte said. ``We've got some guys who have been
there and we're able, I guess, to focus a little bit more maybe
whenever we get in tough situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Without intending to, Pettitte just delineated the different
performances by the two Series rotations and why New York holds a
2-0 edge. But that it is Pettitte doing the delineating might be
unusual, given how the Yankees worked so hard to deal him away at
midseason.
</P>
<P>
   New York's thinking was Anaheim's Chuck Finley would give the
Yankees a more experienced left-handed arm, in addition to the
mental toughness that some in the organization insisted Pettitte
lacked. At 5-7 (5.59 ERA) at the All-Star break, Pettitte was
rumored for weeks to be on his way out of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``It knew it was out of my control if the organization wanted to
get rid of me,'' he said. ``I was going through a struggle and
there was nothing else I could do. I couldn't work any harder.''
</P>
<P>
   It eventually paid off, though pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre
worked more on his confidence more than any mechanical adjustment.
Pettitte was 9-4 in the second half with a 3.84 ERA, lowest among
Yankee starters.
</P>
<P>
   Now making his fourth career Series start, Pettitte faces
Atlanta for the third time, and after the Braves carved him up in
Game 1 of the 1996 Series (six hits and seven runs in 2 1/3
innings), he has made amends.
</P>
<P>
   He wound up beating the Braves in Game 5 that fall and last
October won the clinch game against San Diego that brought the
Yankees the championship. Moreover, he has not given up a series
run since the mauling by Atlanta, bringing a 15 2/3-inning
scoreless streak to Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   He also will be pitching on eight days' rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always concerned about that,'' he said. ``I'm not a guy
that likes to go on a lot of rest, especially pitching here in
Yankee Stadium. The crowd gets so into it. Sometimes the juices get
flowing too much.''

KINGS SEASON IS AN ICEBERG NOT AN ICICLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The scariest line heard around the Los Angeles Kings dressing
room last Friday wasn't coming from inside, where coach Andy Murray
was laying into his team for a lousy effort against the Phoenix
Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   It came from a passerby looking for either the bathroom or an
exit to the parking lot. ``Hey, do you know if the Lakers won?''
</P>
<P>
   Less than three days after the Staples Center opened, the Kings
buzz had moved on with one fan. The team's one-month window _ when
they are the only game in town _ was closing.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs, the posh club for season-ticket holders that was
jammed on opening night had about a dozen stragglers _ albeit a
dozen stragglers in either sequins or spandex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, they looked really bad tonight,'' one said.
</P>
<P>
   There will be plenty of nights to party at the new arena, but
the city of Los Angeles has to realize that the Kings' season is
not a sound byte, it is a six-month process. It will include great
moves by Ziggy Palffy, bad passes by Aki Berg, defensive lapses by
Ziggy Palffy and great penalty kills by Aki Berg.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a race to the Stanley Cup. This team is not equipped
to go that far this year. But it is a playoff team and well worth
following for the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   Knee-jerk reactions are not solely an L.A. thing. In Montreal
where he grew up, Luc Robitaille would need a wig and fake mustache
to go out after scoring one goal in five games after scoring seven
in the first week.
</P>
<P>
   Hockey is a sport finding its way in the U.S. even if it has
been here forever. And that goes for the hockey hotbeds, where
people frequently talk about Los Angeles as LA-LA Land.
</P>
<P>
   __ Vanbiesbrouck back: In Philadelphia, there nearly was civil
unrest when the Flyers began the season 0-5-1. There was talk they
needed to get rid of overpriced underachiever Eric Lindros, who
wants no part in leading the team. And they were writing obituaries
about 36-year-old goaltender John Vanbiesbrouck.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Sunday night, the Beezer, as he is known to those who
subscribe to the Hockey News, recorded his third consecutive
shutout as the Flyers killed off their 18th straight penalty in
winning their fourth in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Vanbiesbrouck has gone 214 minutes, 27 seconds without giving up
a goal, just short of his career record of 218 minutes, 42 seconds,
set last January. Of his three shutouts, two came last week against
the New York Rangers, then Sunday's against his other former team,
the Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a dead man.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if deep down it felt great to shut out teams that had
given up on him, Vanbiesbrouck said, ``Somewhere not so deep
inside. You think about it. I have a great amount of respect for
Florida and their organization. There is some personal satisfaction
just because you know the people over there a little bit closer.''
</P>
<P>
   In savvy New York, where the World Series resumes tonight,
diehard Rangers fans are crushed.
</P>
<P>
   After the two straight losses to the Flyers, they dropped their
third consecutive shutout to the Vancouver Canucks and their former
captain Mark Messier, who led them to Stanley Cup glory just five
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Since Messier left town two years ago, the Rangers have not made
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter that Messier, now 38 years old, is a shell of
his former greatness who was outplayed on Saturday by former Kings
center Olli Jokinen, now with the New York Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have the league's highest payroll at $58 million and
its worst power play. The crowd got excited earlier when the team
won three straight and free-agent signee Theo Fleury was scoring a
few goals.
</P>
<P>
   Not they think that's all gone. Hey, the season just started. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ Come back, Primeau: Carolina is off to a 4-2-3 start without
holdout center Keith Primeau, who doesn't look like he'll be back
anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes tied the Maple Leafs 3-3 on Wednesday in Toronto,
Primeau's hometown. He was seen around town in an NHL union jacket
but didn't visit his teammates and declined interview requests.
</P>
<P>
   Primeau's agents, Don and Todd Reynolds, recently met with
Carolina GM Jim Rutherford, but the impasse continues. Don Reynolds
said the club rejected a five-year deal worth more than $4 million
annually. Primeau, a restricted free agent, already had rejected
the Hurricanes' offers of five years for $20 million, two years for
$7 million and two years for $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The agents have not asked that Primeau be traded. Carolina
insists he won't be, saying the only way he'll get more than $3
million a year from the 'Canes is if the team has to match a
lucrative offer sheet; Primeau is not likely to get one. Both sides
say they are prepared to wait each other out for the rest of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't good for a team that is just 2 for 26 on the power
play or has sold just 6,000 season tickets in its new arena in
Raleigh.

 &HT;    BCS: It's FSU, Penn St.
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If college football's regular season had ended Saturday, Florida
State and Penn State would be playing in the Sugar Bowl for the
national championship.
</P>
<P>
   That was the verdict of the first Bowl Championship Series
ranking released Monday night, which had Florida State No. 1 and
Penn State a No. 2 by a half-point margin over No. 3 Virginia Tech.
Once-beaten Tennessee was a distant fourth, followed by undefeated
Kansas State.
</P>
<P>
   The BCS standings use four components to establish a numerical
ranking for college football teams: the average ranking of the two
major opinion polls (Associated Press media poll and USA Today/ESPN
coaches poll); the average ranking in eight computer polls (with
the lowest ranking thrown out); a strength of schedule rank; and a
team's losses, which count one point each in the formula. The lower
the total, the higher the team is ranked.
</P>
<P>
   These rankings will be released weekly until Dec. 5, when the
top two teams in the final BCS ranking will be picked to go to the
Sugar Bowl, which will be played Jan. 4 in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State (8-0) had the lowest total and thus the No. 1
ranking, because it was No. 1 in both major polls and was ranked no
lower than second in seven of eight computer polls. Its No. 4
ranking in the Dunkel Index was thrown out. FSU's strength of
schedule, now at 21, figures to only get better with games
remaining against Virginia (4-3), Maryland (5-2) and Florida (6-1).
</P>
<P>
   Penn State (8-0) edged out Virginia Tech (6-0) for No. 2 thanks
to its strength of schedule. The Nittany Lions' schedule is No. 8
while Virginia Tech of the Big East is No. 42. Penn State's
schedule will get stronger as it faces Illinois, Minnesota,
Michigan and Michigan State down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, if Florida State and Penn State win the rest of
their games, they will meet in the Sugar Bowl regardless of what
Virginia Tech does.
</P>
<P>
   But if one or both of those teams struggle, the door will be
open for Virginia Tech, Tennessee, Kansas State or Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Although it has lost to Florida, Tennessee is ahead of unbeaten
Kansas State because its schedule is ranked No. 4 while K-State's
is 43. Florida, ranked No. 6, could improve its strength of
schedule by beating Georgia this week. The Gators still have a date
with No. 1 Florida State and would face a ranked team should they
reach the SEC Championship Game.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech (5-1) is ranked No. 7 in both major polls but is
No. 8 in the BCS rankings. Its current strength of schedule, now at
No. 64, figures to improve with games against N.C. State, Clemson,
Virginia and Georgia.

TEXAS JUDGE SAYS HIS COURT HAS SOLE JURISDICTION OVER FORTUNE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Calif.) 
 
By RON NISSIMOV 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A Texas judge on Monday said former Playmate of the
Year Anna Nicole Smith can pursue her bankruptcy claims in Los
Angeles, as long as the federal court there does not try to divide
the estate of her deceased billionaire husband.
</P>
<P>
   Harris County Probate Judge Mike Wood said his court has sole
jurisdiction over divvying up the fortune of Houston oil tycoon J.
Howard Marshall II, estimated at $200 million to $1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The estimates are divergent because most of Marshall's wealth
was tied up in Koch Industries stock, a Wichita, Kan., oil pipeline
and mineral conglomerate that is the nation's second-largest
privately held company. Since the company is private, its value is
in dispute. According to Forbes magazine, the company earned $700
million last year on sales of $35 billion, 18th in sales among all
U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   Wood said he has jurisdiction over the estate because the
probate lawsuit was filed first in Harris County after Marshall's
death in 1995 at age 90. A trial is to begin in Wood's court Jan.
24.
</P>
<P>
   Wood said rulings made May 20 by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Samuel
Bufford in Los Angeles may have already infringed on his
jurisdiction here. But he said he will ``wait and see'' what
happens in Bufford's court in the near future before reaching a
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the bankruptcy court has any jurisdiction to
enter any order on the estate,'' Wood said. ``It strikes me that
reading the order from May 20, it does interfere with the estate.''
</P>
<P>
   The bankruptcy trial is scheduled to begin Wednesday in Los
Angeles. Bufford's May 20 order stipulated that Smith and E. Pierce
Marshall of Dallas are entitled to ``share equally'' in the estate
and Koch Industries.
</P>
<P>
   Bufford's decision was not based on the merits, but as a way to
sanction E. Pierce Marshall, 60, the youngest of two sons, for
allegedly destroying evidence and not showing up for depositions.
The younger Marshall claims his father willed him the entire
fortune.
</P>
<P>
   His attorneys deny that they or their client did anything to
warrant such sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's attorney, Tom Cunningham, told Wood on Monday that
Bufford's rulings do not affect the estate because Smith is suing
E. Pierce Marshall personally in bankruptcy court, and she is
making no claim there against the estate. He also said Bufford has
indicated he will ``not step on the toes'' of the Harris County
court and that his May decisions could be retracted.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's finally got her day in court; she's finally got a judge
to listen to her,'' Cunningham told Wood. ``Now they're trying to
come to you and say shut it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it would be ``unprecedented'' for Wood to issue an
injunction in an attempt to stop the bankruptcy proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Wood was skeptical that the May 20 rulings would not encroach on
his jurisdiction, but said he would ``accept Mr. Cunningham's
representations,'' for now.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said it seemed to him that, with one exception, all
the legal claims Smith is making against E. Pierce Marshall in
California appear to infringe on his jurisdiction
</P>
<P>
   E. Pierce Marshall's attorney, Don Jackson, said all the claims
Smith is pursuing against his client in bankruptcy court are
inexorably linked to the estate. Smith is suing E. Pierce Marshall
personally, on grounds that he fraudulently transferred estate
money to himself.
</P>
<P>
   Although E. Pierce Marshall's attorneys asked Wood to halt the
Los Angeles proceedings, they said Monday that Wood's statements
will likely protect their client adequately.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said Smith's attorneys are seeking a judgment in
bankruptcy court that would determine what she is owed by the
estate. Smith is claiming she is entitled to at least $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said the bankruptcy court would be unable to render a
monetary judgment without ruling on issues under the sole
jurisdiction of the Harris County court, including determining
Koch's value and whether it is part of the estate.
</P>
<P>
   Under a living trust signed by J. Howard Marshall II in the
early 1980s, all his interests in Koch was gradually transferred
from his estate to a company called Marshall Petroleum Inc., which
today is owned by E. Pierce Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   E. Pierce Marshall's attorneys are claiming that Smith is only
entitled to a portion of the estate, but that MPI is not part of
it. They have said the estate has no more money in it.
</P>
<P>
   J. Howard Marshall II's eldest son, J. Howard Marshall III, has
also sued, claiming he is owed half of the family wealth and that
his brother fraudulently deprived him of his share.
</P>
<P>
   Both the claims of Smith and the eldest son are based on oral
contracts they allegedlyd into with J. Howard Marshall II.
The 1992 will, which they claim is invalid, does not mention either
of them.

   Smith, also a former Guess? jeans model, said she agreed to

   She filed for bankruptcy in 1996 because of mounting bills and
what her lawyers called ``questionable lawsuits'' against her,

the California bankruptcy case to protect his interest in the
estate, but Bufford denied the motion, his attorney James Hartnett,
Jr. of Dallas told Wood on Monday.

   WASHINGTON _ A Learjet that took off from Orlando, Fla., Monday
morning, carrying the golfer Payne Stewart and apparently five
others, traveled a wayward path across the country for four hours
with no one at the controls shadowed by Air Force jets that watched
it finally crash in a South Dakota field. Everyone on board,
including the two pilots, was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators said the pilots appeared to have lost
consciousness or died, possibly from a lack of oxygen, shortly
before they were supposed to turn west toward Dallas, their
intended destination.
</P>
<P>
   The plane crashed after running out of fuel, ending the life of
one of golf's most recognizable figures, known as much for his
traditional knickers and tam-o'-shanter as for his achievements on
the course. Stewart won his first major tournament, the
Professional Golfers' Association championship, in 1989, and
followed it up with a victory in the U.S. Open two years later. But
he went into a slump, and his success tapered off over the next
seven years. In this year's Open, in June at Pinehurst in North
Carolina, he outdueled Phil Mickelson by sinking a 15-foot putt on
the last hole. It was the longest putt to ever decide the Open on
the final hole.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart had been headed for a tournament in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The twin-engine, high-performance, $2.5 million jet, which can
carry eight passengers, left Orlando at 9:19 a.m. The pilots' last
contact with air traffic controllers was routine, at about 9:45,
when the plane was northwest of Gainsville, Fla. But the pilots
stopped responding to air traffic controllers soon after.
</P>
<P>
   Controllers at the Federal Aviation Administration's
Jacksonville center called the Air Force, which dispatched planes
from Tyndall Air Force Base, near Panama City, in northern Florida;
from Eglin Air Force Base, in the Florida panhandle; and from bases
in Tulsa, Okla., and Fargo, N.D. An Air Force F16 pilot reported
that there was no movement in the cockpit and the plane appeared to
be on autopilot.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Chris Hamilton, another Air Force pilot, reported that
the windows of the Learjet were fogged, possibly a sign that the
cabin had become so chilled with stratospheric air that the
moisture in the cabin atmosphere had spread itself like dew or
frost on the windows. That may have been from loss of cabin
pressure or from smoke on board, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton said, ``It's a very helpless feeling to pull up
alongside another aircraft and realize the people inside that
aircraft potentially are unconscious or in some other way
incapacitated.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there's nothing I can do physically from my aircraft even
though I'm 50 to 100 feet away, to help them at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The FAA said two crew members and three passengers were on the
jet, including Stewart's agents, Robert Fraley and Van Ardan, and
two pilots, Michael Kling and Stephanie Bellegarrigue. But the
golfer Jack Nicklaus said he believed that a golf course designer
who works with him, Bruce Borland, was also aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Under a standing Pentagon rule, called ``instructions for
destruction of derelict airborne objects,'' an out-of-control
aircraft can be shot down, with permission from the president, if
it threatens public safety, said Major Michael G. Birmingham of the
U.S. Army, a spokesman for the North American Aerospace Defense
Command, which coordinated the chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds kind of cold but that's what it is,'' said
Birmingham, adding that he did not believe that a plane had ever
been shot down under the policy.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with the FAA and the Pentagon, Air Force
officials considered shooting the plane down, Birmingham said, but
concluded, about an hour and seven minutes before the crash, that
the plane, which was flying northwest, would come down in a
sparsely populated area in South Dakota. In their preliminary
reports, the FAA put the time of the crash at 1:26 p.m. and the Air
Force put it about nine minutes earlier. Preliminary radar data
showed that the plane made a U-turn, doubling back in the last few
minutes of the flight, but investigators have not verified this.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was informed of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   After the crash, investigators from the National Transportation
Safety Board rushed to the scene but had little hope of retrieving
useful information from the cockpit voice recorder, because it had
a standard tape loop of only 30 minutes, and the incident took over
four hours.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said cabin depressurization was a key suspect in
disabling the pilots, but that it was also possible that smoke or
some other problem was responsible.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The plane was equipped, as airliners are, with a red light and a
horn, which pilots cannot turn off, to warn when the atmospheric
pressure inside the cabin is equal to the pressure outside at
10,000 feet. If the pressure in the cabin reaches the pressure
outside at 14,000 feet, oxygen masks for the passengers are
supposed to drop automatically.
</P>
<P>
   One air safety investigator who is not directly involved in this
crash said that depressurization ``could be very insidious.'' He
explained that the problem could slowly deprive the crew of its
ability to know what was happening. ``It could be one of those
things where you're feeling good, you're feeling happy, and you
don't know what's going on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some planes have suffered ``explosive decompression,'' or sudden
loss of pressure, but the initial impression of experts was that
this did not happen on Monday because the plane continued to fly
for hours with no apparent structural damage, which would be
expected with a sudden loss of pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA was unable to say Monday precisely when it had concluded
that the pilots had stopped responding, but at 10:08 a.m. ET,
planes were sent from Tyndall Air Force Base. At 10:22, an F16 and
an A-10 from Eglin, already in flight, were diverted to catch the
Learjet, but only the F-16 made it.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, who was flying the F-16, broke off a half hour later
to land at Scott Air Force Base, near St. Louis, for lack of fuel,
and four F-16s from the Oklahoma Air National Guard, on a training
mission over Kansas, gave chase but never caught up. Later, F-16s
from Fargo, N.D, found the Lear and watched it spiral through the
clouds, probably because one of its two engines had run out of
fuel, and crash.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian interceptors were waiting on their side of the border
in case the plane made it that far, Birmingham said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, a Lear 35 built in 1976, was operated by Sun Jet
Aviation, of Sanford, Fla., near Orlando. It had been cleared to
39,000 feet by controllers in Jacksonville, according to James E.
Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, who
said it had reached 37,000 feet at the time of the last contact
with the crew, at 9:44.
</P>
<P>
   The Lear carried an autopilot system that could keep the nose
pointed at a constant compass heading and could maintain an
altitude or a rate of climb. It may have been set to maintain a
rate of climb but stopped at 45,000 feet, the maximum altitude the
model can reach.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout its flight, whether the crew was incapacitated or
dead, the plane itself continued to function. A transponder, or
radio beacon, continued to broadcast the plane's identity and
altitude as it was interrogated by FAA radars en route.
</P>
<P>
   Accidents in which pilots are disabled or killed in planes that
then fly for hours on autopilot are rare but not unprecedented. In
January 1997 the pilot of a four-seat Piper Dakota took off from
Long Island and was overcome by carbon monoxide leaking in through
the heating system; as his 71-year-old mother took the controls and
radioed for help, a flight instructor in an interceptor plane
rushed to her assistance. But the mother, too, was overcome with
the gas, and the plane flew to northern New Hampshire, where it
crashed, killing both.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980 an earlier model Lear had a similar accident, flying
from Shreveport, La., into the Atlantic off Virginia, also
apparently on autopilot. The plane carried Bo Rein, the Louisiana
State University football coach.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas A. Williams, a commercial pilot with 7,000 hours of
experience in Learjets, said that if the altitude warning system
went off, the proper procedure was to contact air traffic
controllers and drop to 10,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   A pressure loss could have been too gradual for the crew to
notice, he said, ``but I can't imagine the airplane's warning
system not working.''

NEWSPAPER MAGAZINE SHARES PROFITS WITH A SUBJECT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (mk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Except for its girth _ 164 pages _ the Oct. 10 issue of The Los
Angeles Times Magazine did not appear to be unusual. Its sole theme
was the new Staples Center sports arena, but newspaper magazines
often devote entire issues to one topic, like fashion or
philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   But what was far less common was a financial arrangement between
The Times and the arena. According to the executive editor of the
magazine and a manager who worked on the project in its early
stages, the newspaper and the arena shared the profit from the
issue. The manager, Holly Bowyer, confirmed that the issue brought
in more than $2 million in advertising revenue.
</P>
<P>
   It is unusual for a newspaper to share profits with an
institution that is the focus of continuing news coverage. The
arrangement, which provoked anxiety in the newsroom, evolved from a
broader business contract, signed last year, that makes The Times
one of 10 ``founding partners'' _ a version of corporate
sponsorship _ of the Staples Center. It gives The Times a corporate
box and allows it to advertise around the arena, according to two
managers on the project.
</P>
<P>
   Times officials declined to comment on the arrangement. The
communications director of the Staples Center did not return three
messages left on his voice mail Monday afternoon. The center is
owned by three main investors: Philip Anschutz, a Denver
billionaire and a large shareholder of Qwest Communications; Ed
Roski, a wealthy real estate executive, and News Corp., which holds
a 40 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   The arena, which cost $400 million to build, is home to the
Lakers and Clippers professional basketball teams and the Kings
professional hockey team . It is the centerpiece of a downtown
renewal movement supported in editorials by the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between advertising and news has been a source
of anxiety in the newsroom of The Times since 1997, when Mark
Willes, then the newspaper's publisher, announced that he would
foster closer ties between the business and news sides of the
paper.
</P>
<P>
   In the ensuing two years, the anxiety had dissipated somewhat in
the absence of any evidence of business-side interference with the
newsroom. But recent events _ like the Staples-Times profit-sharing
arrangement _ have rekindled it.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine issue on the Staples Center provoked enough concern
on the part of the city editor, Bill Boyarsky, that he resisted
allowing his reporters to be associated with it. ``I was concerned
because this was an advertising-generated issue of the magazine,''
Boyarsky said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Boyarsky added that after he arranged to have the main
responsibility for a critical examination of whether the Staples
Center could help revive downtown Los Angeles, he dropped his
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Drex Heikes, the executive editor of the magazine, said that he
did not know about the profit-sharing arrangement until about 10
days ago, when a business executive came into his office and asked
him to calculate what the news department had spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The content of the magazine was exclusively controlled by
editorial,'' Heikes said. The magazine had perhaps a dozen articles
of varying lengths, including a profile of Anschutz by The Times'
sports editor, Bill Dwyre; an examination of various personalities
who put the arena deal together, and the exploration of the urban
renewal issues.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bowyer, who had until earlier this year been the magazine's
general manager _ a position developed under Willes' aegis to help
coordinate the efforts of the news and business departments _
confirmed on Monday the outline of the profit-sharing agreement but
would not say what percentage each side would get.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Goldstein, a spokeswoman for Times Mirror, the
newspaper's parent, declined to comment on the arrangement except
to say, ``We don't talk about contractual relationships with our
advertisers.''
</P>
<P>
   But she added that with the Oct. 10 issue of the magazine,
``Editorial was in full control of the content.'' She continued,
``Advertisers were interested because the Staples Center is very
important to the rebuilding of downtown.''
</P>
<P>
   The existence of the profit-sharing arrangement was first
disclosed last week in New Times, one of the city's alternative
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Parks, the editor of The Times, said in a telephone
interview on Sunday: ``I really don't know the details on Staples.
It was a very complex arrangement.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that he and John McKeon, the newspaper's senior
vice president for advertising, had advised the publisher, Kathryn
Downing, against planning a similar, 200-page special issue of the
magazine to coincide with next summer's Democratic National
Convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were discussions of what to do in terms of the
Democratic convention and whether we could do a magazine'' pegged
to that event, he said, adding, ``Both John McKeon and I advised
the publisher that 200 pages was not a realistic thing,'' because
they doubted that either reader or advertiser interest would be
sufficient.

CLIPPERS ROOKIE PRODUCING HIGHLIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Lamar Odom exhibition-tour highlight reel is
threatening to grow into a mini-series. The early reviews are
promising.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the most spectacular things I've ever seen,''
said Los Angeles Clippers assistant coach Jim Todd, referring to a
scene the 6-foot-9, four-position rookie produced in the second
half of Sunday's 104-93 victory over Seattle at Spokane, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   If you only see one Odom highlight, his teammates said, this was
the one. Until the next game.
</P>
<P>
   After a quick trip to the replay booth, we offer something less
than justice for Sunday's play that began with Odom getting bumped
off balance on a long defensive rebound. With the ball still up for
grabs, Odom went horizontal to retrieve it while surveying the
court ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   What he saw was Tyrone Nesby speeding toward the Clippers hoop.
To complete the play, Odom _ a lefty _ whipped a right-handed,
behind-the-back bounce pass to Nesby, who took it in stride and
finished with a polite jam.
</P>
<P>
   Odom left Spokane with an impolite 19 points, a game-high 14
rebounds and six assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a special kind of player,'' said teammate Maurice Taylor,
who had 27 points and 9 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   After the Clippers' weekend sweep _ they won at Vancouver on
Friday _ Odom is averaging 17 points and eight rebounds per game.
By making 15 of 24 shots, he improved his field-goal percentage
from 39 to 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still learning,'' coach Chris Ford said. ``The entire
season is going to be a learning experience.''
</P>
<P>
   That could go double for players assigned to guard him.
</P>
<P>
   __ Reality check: While the Clippers finished the exhibition
road trip at 4-2, they realize that only one of their six foes _
Phoenix _ finished the previous season in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made some strides,'' Taylor said, ``but we're not where
we want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford said he'll remain picky about two areas that require
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to continue to get better defensively,'' he said,
``and what goes hand in hand with that is rebounding. There has to
be a conscious effort from all five guys on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want gang rebounding.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, whose meager rebounding last season was indirectly
included in owner Donald T. Sterling's list of reasons for
withholding a lucrative contract-extension offer, checked in with
20 over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``When somebody tells me what I !ital!can't do, I show 'em what
I !ital!can do,'' the power forward said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Fast breaks: Eric Piatkowski (sore ribs) didn't play in the
Seattle game and Derek Anderson (back spasms) was forced to leave
the lineup early. Both are expected to play in Wednesday's
exhibition home opener vs. the Milwaukee Bucks at Staples Center.

NEW ALLIANCE WILL PROMOTE WIRELESS ACCESS TO INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A group of leading technology companies said Monday that they
would form an alliance to create products that would allow
consumers to get high-speed Internet access through a wireless
system within the next year.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium _ which is led by Cisco Systems Inc., the giant
Internet networking company, and Motorola Inc., the maker of
wireless telephone products _ is essentially backing an alternative
to delivering broadband Internet access through underground cables
and wires.
</P>
<P>
   The race to bring broadband Internet access to consumers has led
to several alliances that promise to deliver that kind of service
through satellites, cellular telephone networks and standard cable
and telephone lines. Now, the group headed by Cisco and Motorola is
trying to provide a cheaper and more effective solution to digging
up the ground and laying cables: They want to deliver data, voice
and video services over the airwaves and directly into buildings
and homes that are affixed with antennas or the equivalent of a
satellite dish.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the technology that is going to take the fixed
broadband wireless market into the next millennium,'' said Steve
Smith, director of marketing in the broadband wireless business
unit at Cisco Systems, which is based in San Jose, Calif. ``This
gets consumers Internet access without tearing up the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Cisco Systems said Monday that a group of 10
companies _Motorola, Texas Instruments, Broadcom, Bechtel
Telecommunications, Samsung, Toshiba, LCC International, EDS, KPMG
Consulting and Pace Microtechnology _ had agreed to create and
develop products that use a Cisco technology, one that is equipped
to deliver Internet service over a radio frequency called MMDS.
</P>
<P>
   Aware that the AT&AMP;T Corp. was moving into cable television and
developing a system capable of delivering high-speed Internet
access through its cable services, MCI Worldcom and Sprint have
spent about $1 billion in the last few years to buy many of the
companies that owned the licenses to the MMDS radio spectrum. Three
weeks ago, MCI Worldcom agreed to acquire Sprint in a $115 billion
merger.
</P>
<P>
   If the technology is successful, it appears that Internet
service providers will be able to choose among cable operators,
wireless service providers and perhaps even satellite operators
like Teledesic LLC, which is developing a kind of ``Internet in the
Sky'' technology, a multibillion-dollar plan backed by the cellular
telephone pioneer Craig McCaw and William H. Gates of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems and Motorola are also backing something called
LMDS, which is another radio frequency that offers broadband
access, mostly to businesses. According to Cisco officials,
however, the MMDS system is more effective in crowded urban areas
and is more easily available to everyday consumers and the mass
market.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Edwards, a spokesman at Motorola, which is based in
Schaumburg, Ill., said Monday that the company was backing both the
LMDS and MMDS technologies and working to develop a large portfolio
of offerings so that big technology companies and consumers could
have a wide range of alternatives to getting broadband access.
</P>
<P>
   The companies involved in the agreement Monday said that the
ability to deliver high-speed broadband access through a wireless
system would also rapidly accelerate the introduction of broadband
services to rural areas and urban centers, and do so more easily
and inexpensively.

 &HT;    Payne Stewart, professional golfer, dead at 42
 &HT;    (EDS: MOVING TO (A) GENERAL NEWS AND (S) SPORTS CATEGORIES.)
 &HT;    By Craig Dolch
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ With his trademark knickers and tam
o'shanter cap, Payne Stewart never had a problem standing out in
the crowd. Neither did his game.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, one of the most recognizable and talented golfers to
play the game, died Monday when a private plane he was on crashed
in South Dakota, killing all passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Most golf fans will remember Stewart, the reigning U.S. Open
champion, for his fashion statements. But it was his game and
personality that caught the eye of other top professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``That smooth swing, the plus-fours, his tongue-in-cheek wit ...
that's what I'll remember most about Payne,'' Jack Nicklaus said.
``He always had a little bit of a needle out. He always had fun
with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, 42, had plenty of reasons to smile during a career in
which he won 18 times around the world, with three majors among his
11 PGA Tour titles. He was just finishing the best season of his
20-year career, highlighted by his second U.S. Open victory and a
spot on the U.S. Ryder Cup team. He was third on the PGA Tour's
1999 money list with more than $2 million in earnings and stood
eighth in the world ranking of golfers.
</P>
<P>
   The sight of Stewart pumping his fist in the air after he made a
15-foot putt on the final hole _ the longest such putt to win a
U.S. Open _ remained an indelible impression with most golf fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was so much left for him,'' Nick Price said. ``That's
what makes this so tragic.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart also won the 1989 PGA Championship and the 1991 U.S.
Open, which should earn him a ticket to the World Golf Hall of
Fame. After the second U.S. Open victory, Stewart credited his
new-found faith for helping to carry him through some difficult
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so much more at peace with myself than I've ever been in
my life,'' he said. ``Where I was with my faith last year and where
I am now is leaps and bounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was traveling Monday from his Orlando home to Dallas,
where he was to play in a corporate outing before going to Houston
today for the PGA Tour Championship. Two other golfers from
Orlando, Stuart Appleby and Lee Janzen, had considered flying to
Texas with Stewart until they learned he was leaving a day early
because of the outing.
</P>
<P>
   The news of Stewart's death _ which took more than four hours to
confirm because the plane flew out of control before crashing when
it ran out of gas _ left the golf world stunned. Before the plane
crashed, stars such as Mark O'Meara, Janzen, Ernie Els and Scott
Hoch already had rushed to Stewart's home to comfort his wife
Tracey and their two children.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an enormous void and emptiness I feel right now,''
Tiger Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Palmer called Stewart's death ``one of the most terrible
tragedies of modern-day golf.''
</P>
<P>
   USGA president Buzz Taylor, who handed the championship trophy
to Stewart at Pinehurst, said: ``The first thing that came to my
mind was Tony Lema (who died in a plane crash after winning the
1964 British Open). What a loss he was for the game, and I feel the
same way about Payne.''
</P>
<P>
   The PGA Tour said Stewart's spot in the elite Tour Championship
field will not be filled. A blue ribbon was attached to his
nameplate in the parking lot and the flags at the club and at the
Tour's headquarters were flown at half-staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to express our sense of shock and sadness over
the death of Payne Stewart,'' PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem
said. ``This is a tremendous loss for the entire golfing community
and all of sports.''
</P>
<P>
   The news of Stewart's death was also felt in Europe. Stewart
proudly displayed his patriotism while playing in five Ryder Cups,
but even during last month's controversial matches at Brookline _
when the Americans were criticized for celebrating too much _
Stewart was praised by the European team for his show of
sportsmanship. He was particularly critical of some fans' abusive
treatment of Colin Montgomerie during their singles match, and told
Montgomery he would speak to hecklers if Montgomerie wished.
</P>
<P>
   Masters winner Jose Maria Olazabal had to choke back tears when
he spoke of Stewart's death. ``A true sportsman on the course and a
gentleman off it. We have lost a precious man and someone who still
had good years ahead of him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the players who kept both feet on the ground and
didn't get carried away,'' said Jupiter. Fla.'s Jesper Parnevik.
``I know Montgomerie spoke very highly of him after the last round.
Payne always had a big heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when Stewart won the 1987 Bay Hill Classic, he donated
his entire winner's check to an Orlando hospital in memory of his
father, William, who had died of cancer two years earlier. He was
very active in many other charitable ways in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Success didn't come easy for Stewart. After turning pro in 1979,
it took the Springfield, Mo., native two years to make the PGA
Tour. Then he promptly lost his playing card and supported himself
by playing in Asia and Australia, where he met his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``People forget Payne was a journeyman pro who had to work his
way onto the PGA Tour,'' Price said. ``He made himself into a great
player.''
</P>
<P>
   He also made himself marketable when he decided in 1982 to wear
knickers as a way of drawing attention to himself. ``I won my first
tournament that week,'' he said, ``and the rest is history.''
</P>
<P>
   But by donning the knickers, Stewart was doing more than trying
to make endorsement money. He was trying to be different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payne didn't want to be another blond-haired, blue-eyed
golfer,'' Mark Calcavecchia said. ``He wanted to make a statement.
It took a lot of nerve to wear some of those outfits _ I remember
one of them where he looked like a giant bumblebee. But he always
said what was on his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Price: ``He was always a firm believer in what he believed
in.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was a comedic side to Stewart. Just ask Paul Azinger,
who holed a bunker shot at the final hole to beat Stewart in the
1993 Memorial Tournament. When Azinger went to his locker after the
round, he found bananas in his shoes, compliments of you-know-who.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payne was always so upbeat, the life of the party,''
Calcavecchia said. ``I never saw him down, even when he wasn't
playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart managed to transform his game where he was sometimes
referred to as ``Avis'' (because he finished second so often) into
a cinch Hall of Fame career.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question he's in the Hall of Fame,'' Nicklaus said.
``He won three majors and there's not 10 guys in the world who can
say that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet many fans will undoubtedly remember Stewart simply as the
guy who wore the knickers. Those who knew him best said that
wouldn't be right.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear people talk about his knickers all the time,'' said
close friend and fellow pro Larry Rinker. ``But let's face it, if
he hadn't won those three majors and wasn't on TV all the time, the
knickers wouldn't have mattered. People should remember him for
what he did, not for what he wore.''
</P>
<P>
   Also killed were Stewart's agents, Robert Fraley and Van Ardan,
and the two pilots, identified as Michael Kling, 43, and Stephanie
Bellegarrigue, 27.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm Beach Post reported late Monday night that Bruce
Borland, 40, also died in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Borland's wife, Kate, said she contacted the private jet
terminal Monday afternoon and spoke to an employee who had greeted
her husband and confirmed he intended to board the flight.

 &HT;    Payne Stewart, professional golfer, dead at 42
 &HT;    (EDS: MOVING TO (A) GENERAL NEWS AND (S) SPORTS CATEGORIES.)
 &HT;    By Craig Dolch

<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ With his trademark knickers and tam
o'shanter cap, Payne Stewart never had a problem standing out in
the crowd. Neither did his game.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, one of the most recognizable and talented golfers to
play the game, died Monday when a private plane he was on crashed
in South Dakota, killing all passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Most golf fans will remember Stewart, the reigning U.S. Open
champion, for his fashion statements. But it was his game and
personality that caught the eye of other top professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``That smooth swing, the plus-fours, his tongue-in-cheek wit ...
that's what I'll remember most about Payne,'' Jack Nicklaus said.
``He always had a little bit of a needle out. He always had fun
with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, 42, had plenty of reasons to smile during a career in
which he won 18 times around the world, with three majors among his
11 PGA Tour titles. He was just finishing the best season of his
20-year career, highlighted by his second U.S. Open victory and a
spot on the U.S. Ryder Cup team. He was third on the PGA Tour's
1999 money list with more than $2 million in earnings and stood
eighth in the world ranking of golfers.
</P>
<P>
   The sight of Stewart pumping his fist in the air after he made a
15-foot putt on the final hole _ the longest such putt to win a
U.S. Open _ remained an indelible impression with most golf fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was so much left for him,'' Nick Price said. ``That's
what makes this so tragic.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart also won the 1989 PGA Championship and the 1991 U.S.
Open, which should earn him a ticket to the World Golf Hall of
Fame. After the second U.S. Open victory, Stewart credited his
new-found faith for helping to carry him through some difficult
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so much more at peace with myself than I've ever been in
my life,'' he said. ``Where I was with my faith last yearere
I am now is leaps and bounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was traveling Monday from his Orlando home to Dallas,
where he was to play in a corporate outing before going to Houston
today for the PGA Tour Championship. Two other golfers from

SPORTS COLUMN: YANKEE FANS MUST GUARD THEIR GUESTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Something happened in Atlanta in recent days that was
bizarre by New York standards. Yankee fans bearing the ``NYY''
emblem on their caps, jackets and shirts were allowed to attend the
World Series games unmolested.
</P>
<P>
   As Goya scribbled on his sketches from the battlefield, this I
have seen:
</P>
<P>
   _ Yankee fans riding the Marta trains and buses, chatting with
Braves' fans: ``You guys have great pitching but we've got Jeter
and Williams.'' And nobody got beat up.
</P>
<P>
   _ Norman and Sandra Bell of Lithonia, Ga., with son Brandon, age
9, and daughter, Teylar, age 5, all with Yankee caps, strolling
safely through the corridors of Turner Field. Wise parents would
hesitate to bring children in visiting insignia to a New York ball
park, out of fear of our lionized bullies.
</P>
<P>
   _ People with Munson and Mattingly jerseys chanting ``Go _
Yankees _ Go!'' in unison from their seats. Let's be honest: the
reverse could not happen in Shea and Yankee stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd get the daylights beaten out of you,'' admitted Steve
Kahn, originally from Flanders, N.J., now living in Birmingham,
Ala., whose brother, Bruce, flew down for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I think something should be done,'' Steve Kahn said of
the antisocial behavior in our home region.
</P>
<P>
   The best time to stop the self-indulgent crudeness is Tuesday
night in Yankee Stadium for the third game of the World Series. The
Yankee fans are surely more vociferous than the sedate Atlanta
fans, who had little to cheer over the weekend anyway, but this is
not about good honest noise. This is about violence. It is time for
the civil people left in New York to show some leadership and not
allow the louts to browbeat fans of other persuasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just New York, it's a lot of places,'' said Stan
Kasten, originally from New Jersey, but now the president of the
Braves and Hawks. ``The fans in the Northeast take it more
seriously than anywhere else, but we've all got to do a better job
to make it more pleasant at the ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasten was being polite. It is drastically uglier in Fenway
Park, where some fans rioted over a few bad umpiring calls in the
league series, and in Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia, where some
fans cheered the sight of an inert (and nearly paralyzed) Michael
Irvin of the Cowboys, and in Yankee and Shea stadiums where, during
the playoffs, I heard language and saw aggression that would fit
the out-of-towners' stereotype of rampant back-street New York
muggers.
</P>
<P>
   But these were not, technically, criminals. These were people
who could afford tickets to playoff games. These were fans who
drove home to the suburbs in sport utility vehicles. On a few
snootfuls of very expensive beer, they were using something as
trivial as a ball game to take out their anger at, well, whatever.
</P>
<P>
   I saw New Yorkers snatch Braves and Red Sox caps off the heads
of visitors. I heard people yell things that would inflame a
rational person, to say nothing of a hothead like John Rocker, the
Braves' reliever. Tom Glavine and John Schuerholz of the Braves
have spoken of the batteries and invective hurled at their
families. To paraphrase Walt Kelly, we have met the enemy and it is
our brothers and our sons.
</P>
<P>
   The cretins get away with it because we think it is cute. One
New York tabloid treats the Yankee Stadium Bleacher Creatures as if
they were funny rather than borderline sociopaths. We shrug and
say, ``Hey, it's New York.'' I hope not. I'm a lifelong New Yorker,
but I've about had it with the creeps at our ball parks.
</P>
<P>
   Things were much sweeter at the ball park in Atlanta, a city I
have grown to like since the end of the 1996 T-Shirt Shack
Olympics. People are nice. For all the image of Atlanta's becoming
a city of corporate transients, there are enough locals left who
say ``good morning'' to strangers, who chat while waiting for a
bus.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantans say that when they visit New York, people help them
with directions and praise their mellifluous accents. Alas, when
visitors buy tickets to our stadiums, they face physical
intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, that diehard Yankee fan, and
George Steinbrenner, who blusters about law and order, should
insist that security forces actually protect visitors. Up to now,
when a visitor has his ball cap ripped off his head, the Stadium
ushers shrug as if to say, ``Hey, what did you expect?'' Atlanta
fans have the same right to cheer as Yankee fans did in Turner
Field. If we don't stop the assaults, the championships are
tainted. &QL;

WOMEN NEARER TO EQUALITY, NCAA SAYS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LENA WILLIAMS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years ago, the NCAA predicted that it would take 10 to 12
years to achieve equality in men's and women's athletic programs at
its member schools.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are still inequalities, according to a report
issued Monday by the NCAA, more women are participating in
intercollegiate athletics and more women are receiving athletic
scholarships, with parity projected in just six years.
</P>
<P>
   Since the association issued its last report on disparities
between the sexes in 1997, the number of women participating in
athletics in Division I has increased by an average of 28 a school.
By comparison, the number of male athletes increased by an average
of 15 a school.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 percent of all students on intercollegiate teams in
Division I are women, the report found. The proportion was 37
percent two years ago. Women attending Division I schools received
41 percent of scholarship dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such gains, NCAA officials said they felt movement
toward equality was occurring too slowly. They said, for example,
that in every division except I-AAA, at least two-thirds of the
recruiting budgets were spent recruiting athletes for men's teams,
and that head coaches of men's teams received about 60 percent of
salary expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Improvements are being made, but being made much too slowly,''
Cedric Dempsey, the president of the NCAA, said in a news
teleconference. ``To be fully committed to providing opportunities
for all athletes, we must continue to add programs for women and
dedicate more resources to women's programs on our campuses at a
faster rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey pointed out that Division I schools spent an average of
$172,000 on recruitment for men and $72,000 for women. ``That's
just not good enough,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 83-page report was based on a survey of NCAA member schools
conducted in the fall of 1998. Nearly three-quarters of the 747
colleges and universities responded to the survey, which helps
track compliance with Federal regulations at colleges. Similar
studies have been conducted since 1991, with the findings were
published in 1992 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   NCAA officials were so disheartened by the disparities found in
the 1997 report that Dempsey said if progress continued at that
rate, it could take 10 to 12 years to reach parity.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the new survey left him cautiously optimistic.
``Looking at the growth we've seen these past two years, we should
achieve our goal in six years,'' he said. ``I'm encouraged by the 3
percent growth from where we were two years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Levick, who heads the NCAA's committee on women's
athletics, said parity in intercollegiate athletics would be
achieved only when women reached the 50 percent mark in
participation, scholarships, recruitment and salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we're at 40 percent participation, 41 percent in
scholarships, 30 percent in recruiting, 40 percent in head coaches'
salaries and 21 percent for assistant coaches,'' Levick said.
``We've made progress, but until we get percentages equal, we
haven't hit our mark.'' &QL;

<P>
   THOUSAND OAKS, CALIF. -- Sandpiper Networks went public through
a side door by agreeing to be bought by San Francisco-based Digital
Island in a deal valued at $1 billion by the time the financial
markets closed.
</P>
<P>
   Investors caught on quickly Monday, driving Digital Island's
stock sharply higher to a closing price more than 68 percent above
its opening value.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Garrahan, technology analyst for Lehman Brothers
Securities, said the merger puts Sandpiper in the public arena well
ahead of competitor Akamai, which has an initial public offering
scheduled for later this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're effectively going public by being bought,'' Garrahan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Sandpiper and Akamai have systems to move Internet content
closer to the user, speeding download time.
</P>
<P>
   If Akamai prices in the middle of its expected range, its market
capitalization after the initial offering would be $1.5 billion,
Garrahan said.
</P>
<P>
   By that comparison, he said Digital Island is getting a bargain
at the price it is paying for Sandpiper.
</P>
<P>
   Investors apparently agreed, trading in Digital Island's stock
as if it were a fresh new offering. More than 12 million of the
company's shares changed hands Monday after the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   The stock ended trading at $38.6875, up $15.6875 per share on
the day.
</P>
<P>
   The combined companies will be able to share their abilities for
better service, Garrahan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combination gives them a fuller end-to-end solution to

THQ EXPECTED TO POST HIGH EARNINGS

<P>
   CALABASAS, CALIF. -- Even without new offerings from its two
major product lines, video gamemaker THQ Inc. is in position to
report strong growth in its earnings, analysts believe.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus among Wall Street analysts is that THQ will show
third-quarter earnings of 30 cents per share when it reports
Tuesday, despite a lack of fresh titles coming out of its
professional wrestling and Rugrats lines.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Stuart Halpern of Banc of America Securities said he
wouldn't be surprised if THQ's earnings report _ expected to be
released before the market opens _ contains better results than the
First Call consensus estimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``THQ has a very long history of exceeding expectations. There
is a definite upside to that number based on the strong
fundamentals and based on some good product success,'' Halpern
said. ``Even if all they do is make the estimate, they're showing
phenomenal growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's earnings for the same period a year ago were 21
cents per share, 42.9 percent lower than the estimate for this
year's third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Halpern, who is bullish on the video game sector as an industry,
said hardware makers are selling more machines, creating more
demand for the software to run on them.
</P>
<P>
   The company's license with World Championship Wrestling has
expired, but it expects to begin shipping games under license from
the larger World Wrestling Federation some time in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Halpern said the video game sector is poised for a busy holiday
season, which he predicts will be its best ever.

   ORLANDO, Fla. _ The area around this tourism destination is home
to many of the best touring professionals, including Payne Stewart,
who died in a plane crash Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A pro-am tournament at the nearby Bay Hill Club and Lodge, the
site of the Bay Hill Invitational in March, was in progress when
word came that Stewart had died.
</P>
<P>
   ``That made a lot of people sick,'' said Bob Usher, an employee
at the club. ``About 70 percent of them dropped out of the
tournament.'' The flag at the club was lowered to half staff.
</P>
<P>
   The dropouts included fellow PGA players Mark O'Meara and Lee
Janzen, both friends of Stewart. They, along with John Cook, Ernie
Els, Scott Hoch, Ian Baker-Finch, Larry Rinker and Frank Nobilo
later went to the Stewarts' home in a rural area southwest of
Orlando to help comfort Stewart's wife, Tracey, and their two
children, Chelsea, 13, and Aaron, 10.
</P>
<P>
   Three Orange County sheriff's deputies stood guard outside the
gated home. Also there was Ken Williams, a Stewart family friend,
to help police identify friends.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Palmer declined to be interviewed as he left the Bay Hill
club, where he was host of the tournament. ``There's too much going
on right now,'' said Palmer, who was headed to the airport to fly
to Pennsylvania to see his wife, who is ill.
</P>
<P>
   Orange County Sheriff's Deputy Scott Lynch was first to arrive
at the Stewart family home, at 1 p.m. Within an hour, the place was
swarming with members of the news media, and many were still there
after nightfall arrived. Family friends arrived periodically; Lynch
estimated that upward of 100 cars passed through the gate.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Ray Wood, a family friend, said Stewart had been stalwart
in helping a police fund-raising event for children every
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a super person with a huge heart,'' Wood said. ``You'd
see him down at the grocery store and he'd speak to everybody. His
kids played in the youth leagues; in fact, sometimes Payne would
umpire if they needed it. He was just a regular guy, except that he
won three majors and 18 tournaments.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Fraley, 46, a prominent sports agent, was also killed in
the crash. Among his clients were four current or former National
Football League coaches: Bill Parcells of the Jets, Bill Cowher of
Pittsburgh, Dan Reeves of Atlanta and Joe Gibbs, formerly of
Washington. He also represented Seattle Seahawks defensive tackle
Cortez Kennedy and Mets pitcher Orel Hershiser.
</P>
<P>
   Fraley's father, Charles, said his son and Stewart were good
friends who often golfed together and at one time lived near each
other in the same Orlando subdivision.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were real close,'' he said. ``In fact, Robert was
godfather to his children.''

 &HT;    Mandela urges Mideast to defy `prophets of doom'
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Former South African President Nelson Mandela left
office in June. In July, he turned 81 years old. Yet one would be
hard-put to describe him as having retired.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela spoke in Atlanta on Monday night, fresh from a tour of
the Middle East. He outlined his proposals for peace in that region
_ proposals that call for a complete Israeli withdrawal from all
Arab lands seized in the 1967 war. He scoffed at those who say that
will never happen, saying he has ``confounded the prophets of
doom'' more than once in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela's proposal has three parts: the Israeli withdrawal; a
``firm and unequivocal declaration'' from the Arab states that they
recognize Israel's right to exist within secure borders; and the
creation of an international commission to monitor the
implementation of the Arab commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``No proud Arab leader will engage in negotiations with Israel
as long as Israel continues to occupy Arab territories she
conquered in the 1967 war,'' Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he added that Israel had acted in self-defense in 1967 and
could not be expected to yield the territories without being
assured of its security.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela said he had discussed his proposals with many leaders in
the region, as well as with President Clinton and other world
leaders. He said serious political leaders had told him it would be
impossible to persuade the Israelis to withdraw from all occupied
territories, but he disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   He said people had predicted that apartheid could not be
overthrown in South Africa without the spilling of ``rivers of
blood.'' And he said people had predicted, too, that he would never
persuade Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to turn over the suspects in
the bombing of Pam Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We confounded the prophets of doom,'' Mandela said. ``We did
precisely what they said was impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Mandela said, it is necessary for an outsider to help
participants in a struggle, such as that in the Mideast, to
understand the problem in its totality.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are dealing with a problem that has been there a long
time,'' he said, ``you reach a point where nobody is perfectly
correct and nobody is perfectly wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandela came to Atlanta to participate in an Aspen Institute
conference on closing the ``International Poverty Gap.'' He said he
had been invited to an important conference in Asia, but chose
instead to come to Atlanta out of respect for former President
Jimmy Carter, who also participated in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Carter and Mandela lavished praise on each other Monday.
Introducing Mandela, Carter praised his personal courage and said,
``I don't think there's a beating heart here that wasn't stirred
when our speaker was released from prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandela, in turn, praised Carter for his dedication to working
``with the poorest of the poor.'' And both men took turns
criticizing what they said is the ever-increasing gap between the
world's rich and poor.
</P>
<P>
   The similarity between the two men did not end there. Mandela's
post-presidential activities look an awful lot like Carter's. Not
only has Mandela just finished a round of shuttle diplomacy in the
Middle East, something Carter has done more than once, but he also
has established the Nelson Mandela Foundation, which appears
similar to the Carter Center.
</P>
<P>
   The goals of Mandela's organization: promoting international
peacemaking and eradicating ``the degrading scourge of poverty.''

TURNING 52, MRS. CLINTON FEELS LIKE RAISING A MILLION, AND DOES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With skits, songs and speeches, a lineup of Broadway
stars celebrated Hillary Rodham Clinton's 52nd birthday Monday
night in a mix of politics and high-cost entertainment that helped
her raise close to $1 million for her expected campaign for the
U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady and President Clinton took their 10th-row aisle
seats at the Ford Center for the Performing Arts in Times Square at
7:45 p.m. _ 45 minutes late _ and the curtain immediately rose to
reveal the actress Christine Pedis, dressed in a blond wig and a
black pantsuit, singing ``I'll Take Manhattan.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the audience, who had paid up to $1,000 for a seat,
howled with laughter upon realizing that Ms. Pedis was
impersonating Mrs. Clinton. They cheered when a dancing line of
cast members from ``Chicago,'' dressed in blue-and-white Yankee
jerseys and caps, joined her in a slightly altered version of ``New
York, New York.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These Washington blues, are melting away,'' Ms. Pedis sang.
``If she can make it through, she'll make it anywhere,'' the chorus
line echoed. ``Come on, come through, New York, New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's event was notable because it was one of the few
times that Clinton has campaigned with his wife since she began her
exploratory effort.
</P>
<P>
   Although some Democrats have expressed concern that Clinton
might, in the waning days of his presidency, become something of a
drag on his wife's campaign, aides to the Mrs. Clinton said they
welcomed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is an asset,'' said Howard Wolfson, her
spokesman. ``He carried counties in the state that no president has
carried in a generation.''
</P>
<P>
   The opening act at Monday night's Broadway salute set the tone
for a comical, if clearly, pointed night. Mrs. clinton laughed
along with the audience at the obvious parody of one of her bigger
political obstacles _ the portrayal of her as an out-of-towner
trying to make it in New York _ as well as the reminder of her
attempt to portray herself as a Yankee fan by plunking a Yankee cap
on her head at a White House ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Rosie O'Donnell was the moderator, and from the outset, she made
it clear that if Mrs. Clinton was the honoree of the night, Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, Mrs. Clinton's expected Republican opponent, was
the target.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cast of `Smokey Joe's' wanted to be here tonight, but the
mayor had them arrested outside for loitering,'' Ms. O'Donnell
said.
</P>
<P>
   When the actor Alec Baldwin took the stage briefly to encourage
members of the audience to help Mrs. Clinton raise even more money,
he said: ``I thought we'd take a moment to remind everyone why
we're here _ which is because we're going to kick Rudy Giuliani.''
He was drowned out by cheers.
</P>
<P>
   The evening started with a reception at the Supper Club and
ended with a private dinner for big donors at the Russian Tea Room.
It included a diverse group of entertainers, including Mia Farrow,
who read from Mrs. Clinton's book, ``It Takes a Village,'' Chita
Rivera and the Gay Men's Chorus.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, introduced at the first event by Edward Koch, the
former mayor, clearly seemed delighted by all the birthday
attention (her birthday is actually Tuesday and appeared to drop
any pretense that her interest in a race for Senate was only
exploratory.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to work to make it possible for every New Yorker to
feel that they have a vote and a voice in the Senate,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's day of raising campaign funds came as Giuliani
showed signs of spending some of his own on his likely campaign.
His aides began making inquiries about purchasing television time
statewide in November.
</P>
<P>
   That would mark an extraordinarily early start for advertising
in the Senate campaign, though it would be in keeping with the
early pace of this race. Bruce J. Teitelbaum, who is head of
Giuliani's political action committee, declined comment on the
campaign's intentions.
</P>
<P>
   The speeches and the performance came in yet another night of
New York fund-raising featuring Clinton, though the president's
appearance was unusual for one reason: the beneficiary was his
wife. Clinton's frequent trips to the city have been on behalf of
either his own candidacy, the Democratic National Committee or the
party's congressional committees.

   OIL PROFITS RISE, BUT STOCKS FALL
</P>
<P>
   Large oil companies said that third-quarter earnings rose
substantially, with some more than doubling. But investors had

</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN EXPRESS MEETS FORECASTS
</P>
<P>
   American Express said its third-quarter profit rose 13 percent,

customers spent more with its credit cards and increased
investments with its financial planners.
</P>
<P>
   3M PROFIT GAIN TOPS FORECASTS

</P>
<P>
   Berkshire Hathaway, the investment vehicle of Warren Buffett, is

PAYNE STEWART, WHO WON U.S. OPEN TWICE, IS DEAD AT 42 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (See also PLANE-STEWART) 
(js) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Payne Stewart, one of the world's best golfers and a two-time
winner of the U.S. Open, was killed Monday when the Learjet he was
aboard crashed in South Dakota. He was 42.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was on his way to this week's Tour Championship in
Houston when the crash occurred. Federal investigators said that
Stewart and apparently five other people on the plane lost
consciousness, possibly because of a loss of cabin pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Even casual golf fans recognized Stewart on the course because
of the trademark knickers, or plus fours, that he wore during
competition. But he will also be remembered for his talent and his
competitive spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was enjoying the finest year of his career, and his
signature triumph occurred at this year's U.S. Open at Pinehurst,
N.C., in June, when he sank a 15-foot par putt on the final hole to
defeat Phil Mickelson by one stroke. It was one of the great
pressure putts in golf history, the longest putt ever to decide the
Open on the final hole during its 99-year history. It was also a
memorable climax to what would be Stewart's final victory on the
PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   A winner of 18 tournaments worldwide during his 19-year career,
Stewart won three major championships _ this year's Open, the 1989
Professional Golfers' Association Championship and the 1991 U.S.
Open. He was third on this year's tour money list with more than
$2.07 million
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to express our sense of shock and sadness over
the death of Payne Stewart, '' Tim Finchem, the PGA Tour
commissioner, said.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart lived in Orlando, Fla., near many of his peers,
including Tiger Woods, one of Stewart's teammates on this year's
Ryder Cup team. Stewart was one of the most enthusiastic members of
the team, which staged an incredible rally on the final day to win
the Cup back from the Europeans last month.
</P>
<P>
   With a beautiful swing and a superb short game, Stewart
solidified his place as one of the game's top players this year,
accomplishing his two biggest goals _ winning the U.S. Open again
and making the Ryder Cup team. Meanwhile, Stewart talked openly
about his newfound peace and maturity because of a renewed faith in
God. After winning the Open in June, Stewart took an extended
vacation, determined to savor his victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I won the Open the first time, I didn't take enough time
to enjoy it,'' Stewart said after his victory at Pinehurst. ``This
time I'm going to enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Emotional and outspoken, Stewart had tears in his eyes after his
victory at Pinehurst, proving to himself and to others that he was
still one of the game's best players. In a classic back-nine duel
on that Sunday with Mickelson, Stewart made pressure putts on the
final three holes, but it was the final putt that will live in
history. When the putt at No. 18 dropped into the hole to clinch
his victory, Stewart raised his fist and let out a scream as the
gallery roared with him.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was even more impressive because the 1998 U.S. Open
had been bitterly disappointing for Stewart. He took a four-stroke
lead into the final round, but he lost to Lee Janzen by one stroke.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Before this year, Stewart had not won on tour since 1995, and
there were those who wondered whether Stewart would ever win
another major, or perhaps even another PGA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But he started this year strongly, winning the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach
National Pro-Am in March, then winning the Open three months later.
</P>
<P>
   Those two victories helped earn Stewart a spot on this year's
U.S. Ryder Cup team, and Stewart made no secret that he believed
his presence would help the United States win back the cup. When
asked earlier this year what he would do if some of his teammates
were not as enthusiastic about the Ryder Cup as he was, Stewart
joked that he might grab some of them around the neck and shake
them.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Though Stewart was not at his best during the Ryder Cup, winning
only a half-point, his enthusiasm helped unify the team. One of his
teammates, Mark O'Meara, joked about Stewart's habit of playing
Bruce Springsteen's song ``Born in the USA'' on the stereo in the
team's lounge.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we hear Bruce Springsteen, we know Payne's around,''
O'Meara said at the time. ``That's the way Payne is. He wears his
emotions on his sleeve. He's great. What you see is what you get.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Crenshaw, the U.S. Ryder Cup captain, said he would remember
Stewart as ``the life of the party,'' and cited something Stewart
had brought to this year's cup team: Ping-Pong. He insisted that
the team have access to a table to help wind down from the cup
matches.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said he began wearing colorful plus fours because he
wanted to stand out from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in my career, I went to the driving range and I looked
down the way, and there was a guy dressed exactly the same as me,''
Stewart said. ``I decided right then that I would do something
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was born in Springfield, Mo., on Jan. 30, 1957, and
attended Southern Methodist University. He turned professional in
1979 after graduation.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's first major championship victory came in the PGA
Championship at Kemper Lakes outside Chicago in 1989, when he beat
Mike Reid by one stroke. Two years later, Stewart won his first
U.S. Open at Hazeltine National Golf Club in Chaska, Minn.,
defeating Scott Simpson in an 18-hole playoff.
</P>
<P>
   Then came tougher times, when Stewart won only once on tour
between 1991 and 1998. Yet along the way, he transformed himself
from someone who might brush past reporters or fans when he was
upset to one of the most approachable players on the tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a lot more mature and happier,'' he said earlier this
year. ``I've learned what's really important.''
</P>
<P>
   He also cited a newfound faith that he said he was drawn to by
the involvement of his children, 13-year-old Chelsea and
10-year-old Aaron. He is also survived by his wife, Tracey, and his
mother, Bee.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's place in this week's Tour Championship for the top
players on this year's money list will not be filled. A blue ribbon
was tied to his name plate on his parking space at Champions Golf
Club in Houston. The tour announced that Tuesday's pro-am
tournament at the Tour Championship had been canceled and that the
normal tournament schedule would resume Wednesday, pending further
information about memorial services. &QL;

COMMENTARY: THE STORY OF K  
(DW) 
 ANTHONY LEWIS  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Subs the entire story to accommodate new decision by INS
commissioner.)  c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Credit to the commissioner of immigration, Doris
Meissner, for a difficult and important decision. She has ended the
long effort to deport an alien on the basis of secret evidence,
declining to seek further review of court rulings against her
agency, the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   The alien is Hany Kiaraldeen, a 31-year-old Palestinian who has
lived in the United States since 1990 and is married to a U.S.
citizen. His case has become a symbol of a practice that critics
liken to the treatment of Joseph K. in Franz Kafka's ``The Trial'':
imprisonment without knowing the reasons.
</P>
<P>
   It is bedrock American belief that nothing like that can happen
here. No one can be held in prison for years without knowing
exactly what the accusations are, without having a chance to
confront his accusers.
</P>
<P>
   But it does happen here. The Immigration and Naturalization
Service over the last several years has acted to expel about two
dozen aliens from this country on the basis of evidence that they
were not allowed to see. Many of them were, and are, imprisoned
while trying to fight the phantom of secret evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Kiaraldeen was detained by the INS in March 1998 and has been in
a county jail in New Jersey ever since. The INS accused him of
having connections to terrorists, including one involved in the
1993 bombing of the World Trade Center. But it would not tell him
or his lawyers the basis for that charge.
</P>
<P>
   The INS presented classified material in secret to an
immigration judge, Daniel Meisner. All that Kiaraldeen was given
was ``summaries'' identifying no sources. No witnesses were called
to testify, so none could be cross-examined.
</P>
<P>
   Meisner, having read the secret material, concluded that an
evaluation of it ``by a person of ordinary prudence and caution
cannot sustain a finding that [Kiaraldeen) has engaged in terrorist
activity.'' When the INS appealed, two separate three-judge panels
of the Board of Immigration Appeals agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the INS lost again. Kiaraldeen's lawyers had gone to a
federal court to seek his release on a writ of habeas corpus. Judge
William H. Walls of New Jersey, granting the writ, said it was an
unconstitutional denial of due process of law to use secret
evidence against him _ to make him battle ``anonymous slurs of
unseen and unsworn informers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration Service at first indicated that it would not
give up. It secured stays that kept Kiaraldeen in prison at least
temporarily. There was talk that Ms. Meissner would take the
extraordinary step of asking Attorney General Janet Reno to call in
the Board of Immigration Appeals decision for further review.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday night Ms. Meissner decided not to refer the case to
the attorney general _ and the Justice Department concurred in her
decision. Aides said Ms. Meissner felt that the case had gone
through a rigorous administrative process and that the INS had thus
met its obligation to national security.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was said, the rebuttal evidence presented by
Kiaraldeen's lawyers had overcome the secret material presented by
the INS to the courts. In a way that emphasizes the danger of
secrecy in the legal process. It was only because Kiaraldeen's
lawyers were able to get a partial sense of what was involved that
they were able to reply effectively.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate result is that Kiaraldeen will be released from
prison. Under the BIA decision he will be eligible now to become a
legal permanent resident of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meissner's action is a welcome break in a dogged insistence
by the INS on pressing for deportation in secret evidence cases
despite adverse court decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Nasser Ahmed, another person of Arab origin (as almost all those
involved in these cases are), has been in INS detention for three
and a half years. An immigration judge first decided against him on
the basis of secret evidence. Then, when a habeas corpus petition
challenged his detention, the INS gave his lawyers a somewhat
fuller summary of the material, they put on a case, and the judge
changed his mind. The INS appealed, and Ahmed remains in prison.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, Judge Douglas Ginsburg of the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia compared an accused alien to
Joseph K. in ``The Trial.'' He had to prove that he was not a
terrorist without knowing the evidence against him, Ginsburg said:
``It is difficult to imagine how even someone innocent of all
wrongdoing could meet such a burden.''

FAITH AND FAMILY LED STEWART'S PRIORITIES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Filed in ``a'' and ``s'' categories) 
 
By EDDIE SEFKO 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ When professional golfer Dennis Paulson's airplane
touched down Monday in Houston, he instinctively did what he always
does upon exiting the jetway.
</P>
<P>
   He turned on his cell phone and checked his messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had three voice mails,'' Paulson said. ``The first two were
congratulating me for getting into the Tour Championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he clicked onto the third message and learned of the death
of PGA star Payne Stewart in an air tragedy Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made the first two calls seem pretty insignificant,''
Paulson said.
</P>
<P>
   That feeling shrouded Champions Golf Club on Monday. While
players began arriving at the Tour Championship, nobody could
concentrate on golf. Players, fans and tournament officials instead
were grasping for answers about how one of the most popular golfers
in the world _ who in the past few years had come to realize how
important his faith and family were to him _ could be gone so
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   A Learjet in which Stewart was a passenger crashed into a South
Dakota field Monday shortly after noon. Stewart, 42, was to have
traveled from Orlando, Fla., to Houston via Dallas, where he was
going to inspect some property he was considering purchasing.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, players who have competed on golf courses around
the world with Stewart began to realize something tragic had
happened. Flags at Champions were lowered to half staff. The
festive atmosphere of anticipation that always precedes a big golf
tournament suddenly became a somber pall.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel bad for any family when a tragedy like this
strikes,'' said golfer Jim Furyk. ``But Payne is one of our own. He
was very dear to all of us, and this really hits home. There's
nothing I can say. It's just a terrible thing to have happen.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a tragedy that could make anyone wonder why. Stewart was
enjoying the best season of his career. He had won more than $2
million on the PGA Tour this year and won the U.S. Open in July,
his third major championship and his 18th career victory worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   But more important than what was happening on the course was
what Stewart called his personal triumphs. He had recommitted his
life to God in recent years. And with that came a similar
commitment to his family: his wife, Tracey; 13-year-old daughter,
Chelsea; and 10-year-old son, Aaron.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Stewart had reiterated that as the years had
gone by, he realized what was really important in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to blink and miss my family growing up,'' he
said after winning the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am in February. ``I'm
going to be a father. That's very important to me. Golf is
secondary to my family.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Stewart had life figured out.
</P>
<P>
   And then, it was taken from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's in shock,'' said Jeff Maggert of the nearby The
Woodlands, who counted himself among Stewart's close friends on the
tour. ``All you can say is you don't know what to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had grandparents pass away, but I've never had a friend
this close pass away. Payne was just a lot of fun to be around.
Payne made a point to be friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like he had a lot of respect for me and my golf game,
and I had a lot of respect for him and his ability. I don't have
that with a lot of players on tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Maggert said the U.S. Ryder Cup team, which overcame the biggest
margin in Cup history to beat the Europeans last month, became like
a fraternity, with Stewart one of the pledge chairmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, he was everything I respect about a golfer,'' Maggert
said. ``He had the competitiveness, the ability to play under
pressure, his honesty and his feelings, good or bad. He was the
kind of person who could tell you something you didn't want to
hear. But he would step up and say it if he thought you needed to
hear it. He was just a good person.''
</P>
<P>
   One who will be remembered as much for who he was as what kind
of golfer he was. Stewart was a man who once donated his entire
winner's check from a PGA event to the Florida Hospital Circle of
Friends in his father's memory. And yet he was the guy in the funny
knickers who had such a sweet swing that other tour pros freely
admitted they would copy it if they could.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone ever saw Payne Stewart hit a golf ball, it was the
most beautiful, effortless swing you could imagine,'' said Ben
Crenshaw, who captained Stewart and the rest of the Ryder Cup team
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Stewart also was a showman. Because of the way he dressed,
he knew he would draw attention to himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understood pro sports, but he also knew it was
entertainment,'' said fellow pro Tom Kite.
</P>
<P>
   But while the memories will live as Stewart's legacy, there was
no overcoming the sorrow Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what else to say other than to wish the best for
Tracey and the whole family,'' Furyk said. ``There's never a right
thing to say in this situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't prepare for something like this. It takes everybody
by surprise, and there's nothing I can say. It's a terrible thing
to have happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Said tour pro Duffy Waldorf: ``My reaction is shock. I was
driving down the freeway, and I got a call on my cell phone and
heard about it. I drove way past the golf course while I was on the
phone, just because my mind was on the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were calling to make sure I was OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Waldorf was among the players in Orlando over the weekend for
the National Car Rental Classic. He said that if Stewart had
offered him a ride in his plane to the next tournament destination,
there was a good chance he would have accepted the invitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Payne had asked me to hop on the plane with him, I probably
would have,'' Waldorf said. ``This just makes you think of all the
times you've ever flown on an airplane. As pro golfers, we fly
everywhere. You never think of it as being a risky thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess what you have to realize is that every day could be
your last. So you'd better live it to the fullest.''
</P>
<P>
   The entire golf world felt Monday like Stewart got shortchanged
in days.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel like you've lost a big part of the game,'' Waldorf
said. ``It's not something you can expect. And it's hard to deal
with. You're not used to having one of your good friends die.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll never be able to replace Payne.''

TV ADS SHOW BUSH AS AN UPBEAT LEADER PROMISING A FRESH START

 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the front-runner for
the Republican presidential nomination, unveiled his first
television advertisements Monday, and they cast him as a humble,
upbeat leader devoted to lower taxes and better education.
</P>
<P>
   In four commercials set to begin airing on Tuesday in Iowa and
New Hampshire, the states with the earliest Republican contests
next year, Bush keeps his wish list deliberately modest as he
offers the United States ``a fresh start,'' the thematic phrase
that concludes each spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that government should do a few things,'' he
explains in one advertisement, ``and do them well.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush's gaze is placid and his voice gentle, the
commercials represent his campaign's opening salvo in what will
undoubtedly be a bitterly fought and lavishly funded television air
war, among both the Republicans and the Democrats seeking their
parties' nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advertisements are designed in particular to anticipate _
and deflect _ any attacks on his political record in commercials by
the wealthy publisher Steve Forbes, a Republican rival who is
dipping deep into his personal fortune in an effort to neutralize
the unprecedented amount of money that Bush has raised. By Sept.
30, Bush's tally had topped $56 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers have said they are prepared, if necessary, to
spend up to $20 million on advertising in the four and a half
months leading up to the thick cluster of primaries in mid-March,
and Forbes' advisers have pledged to keep pace.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has had commercials on the air since June, an unusually
early start in a presidential contest, and while the advertisements
have not targeted Bush, Bush's advisers are girding for the kind of
negative attack Forbes waged against Bob Dole in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be championship wrestling at its finest,''
said Alex Castellanos, a Republican media consultant who is not
officially affiliated with any presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   With the start of advertising campaigns by several candidates in
addition to Bush over the last few weeks, the presidential race has
entered a newly intense phase.
</P>
<P>
   About two weeks ago, Vice President Al Gore, who is locked in a
tightening battle with former senator Bill Bradley for the
Democratic nomination, introduced his first television commercial,
a 60-second spot condemning the Senate Republicans' defeat of a
nuclear testing ban. Bush had sided with Senate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has since released two more television advertisements: a
60-second spot fleshing out his biography and a 30-second spot
stating his opposition to offshore oil drilling. These commercials
have run mostly in targeted areas like Iowa, New Hampshire and
California.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has yet to run a single radio or television commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell M. West, a political science professor at Brown
University who monitors political advertising, said that Bradley's
success in getting positive ``free media'' from news organizations
and his steady rise in the polls have allowed him to conserve
resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the luxury of waiting a while,'' West said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen.r John McCain of Arizona, who is arguably the most serious
Republican challenger to Bush, has not begun television
commercials, either, a reflection in part of a budget much tighter
than Bush's. McCain had raised about $9.1 million through Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain began airing three different 60-second radio
commercials in New Hampshire last week.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers said their advertisements, each 30 seconds long,
would appear in many of the states with early primaries, but the
advisers would not release a schedule or spending figures.
</P>
<P>
   What is most striking about the first commercials is what they
do not contain: personal and biographical information. Advisers
said such an introduction to the candidate was not necessary,
because of the candidate's surname.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a terrific brand in American politics,'' said Mark
McKinnon, the chief media consultant in charge of producing the
spots. ``We don't have to waste a lot of time talking about where
he comes from. What voters are interested in knowing is what he
plans to do, what he's done.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of the four advertisements address that question head-on.
One focuses on Bush's stewardship of Texas and makes a specific set
of claims _ about Bush's role in cutting taxes and pruning
government spending _ that are intended to shore up his
conservative credentials and address the aspects of Bush's record
that Forbes is most likely to criticize.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to fill in the blanks of who George W. Bush is and
what he's actually accomplished before things that are negative and
inaccurate fill the vacuum,'' said Ralph Reed, an adviser to the
Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also seems to be sending a warning to Forbes in an
advertisement in which Bush says, ``I believe oftentimes campaigns
resort to mud throwing and name calling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are sick of that kind of campaigning,'' Bush adds.
</P>
<P>
   This commercial, like two of the other three, prominently
features Bush talking directly to the camera or an offscreen
interviewer and indicates his advisers' believe that Bush's
personal warmth is one of his greatest assets.
</P>
<P>
   One advertisement focuses solely on Bush's ideas on education
and is densely populated by black and Hispanic children, reflecting
the campaign's repeated overtures to minorities. The Bush campaign
is also running a radio commercial in Iowa this week entirely in
Spanish.

SECOND TRIAL UNDER WAY IN DEATH OF GAY MAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LARAMIE, Wyo. _ Aaron J. McKinney killed a gay student at the
University of Wyoming last year in ``a five-minute emotional rage''
because the student, Matthew Shepard, had made sexual advances that
reminded him of homosexual abuse he had suffered as a child,
McKinney's lawyer told a jury on Monday as his murder trial began
here.
</P>
<P>
   The jury of 12 and four alternates heard a different rationale
for the killing from Cal Rerucha, the prosecutor for Albany County,
who said that McKinney and a friend, Russell Henderson, fully
intended to murder Shepard after kidnapping him and robbing him of
$20. For that, prosecutors are seeking a death penalty for
McKinney.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson pleaded guilty to murder this spring to avoid a death
penalty. He was sentenced to two consecutive life terms with no
chance of parole.
</P>
<P>
   The case attracted wide attention. Shepard, 21, was beaten more
than 20 times on the head with a .357-magnum handgun, tied to a
fence on an isolated prairie road and left to die. He was found by
a bicyclist 18 hours later and taken to a hospital, where he lived
only four more days.
</P>
<P>
   The case became a rallying cry for states and the federal
government to pass and expand hate-crime measures, but fewer than
half the states have passed such measures, and Wyoming remains one
of eight states with no hate-crime laws. Federal lawmakers last
week dropped provisions of a bill that would have expanded the
definition of hate crimes to include crimes motivated by victim's
sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has the case appeared to stir much interest in Laramie. The
spacious courtroom was far from filled. Shepard's mother, Judy, sat
with several friends opposite several of McKinney's relatives,
including his father, Bill McKinney. Otherwise, the audience was
made up of mostly reporters.
</P>
<P>
   In his opening arguments, Jason Tangeman, one of Kinney's
court-appointed lawyers, conceded that McKinney was responsible for
Shepard's death. But in mounting a defense designed to bring a
prison term, rather than execution, Tangeman argued that McKinney's
past, as well as his poor judgment, led him to drug addiction and
alcohol abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Tangeman told jurors that McKinney had been using large amounts
of methamphetamine in the days before the killing and was drinking
heavily in the hours before he and Henderson encountered Shepard at
a local bar.
</P>
<P>
   But in disputing Rerucha's contention that Shepard's sexual
orientation played no role in events leading to the killing and
that McKinney was driven solely by greed and violence, Tangeman
argued that McKinney was ``haunted by a past, that put him into a
rage, put him into a five-minute emotional rage of chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   The distinction is important. If prosecutors can prove malicious
intent and premeditation, they have a better chance of winning a
death sentence. If defense lawyers can show the killing evolved
from a moment of passion or rage, they may persuade the jury to
find the defendant guilty of a lesser charge, like manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   But even if prosecutors put on an air-tight case, it might be
difficult to win a death sentence. Wyoming is one of 38 states that
have a death penalty but one of the least inclined to use it. Since
the Supreme Court ruled in 1976 that capital punishment was
constitutional, Wyoming, Idaho, Colorado and Ohio each have put to
death only one prisoner. Wyoming has only two inmates on death row.
</P>
<P>
   Rerucha presented a chronology for the night of Oct. 6, 1998,
from the Fireside Lounge, where McKinney and Henderson encountered
Shepard, to the beatings, which began as the two drove Shepard
around town and continued at the fence.
</P>
<P>
   But in Tangeman's version, Shepard was portrayed as a sexual
predator who had sought a ride from the two men and had ``reached
over and grabbed Aaron's genitals and licked his ear.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Tangeman told the jury, McKinney ``becomes very,
very upset and beats Matthew Shepard,'' prompted by memories of a
sexual encounter forced upon him by an older boy when he was 7.
Tangeman said the older boy threatened to spread the word that
McKinney was a homosexual. Also, Tangeman said, McKinney at 15 had
a consensual sexual encounter with a male cousin.

STEWART'S CADDIE HEARS NEWS AT COURSE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By EDDIE SEFKO 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Monday started out so normally for a couple of PGA
Tour caddies.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hicks, the caddie for Payne Stewart, and Brian Sullivan,
who loops for The Woodlands' Jeff Maggert, were at Champions Golf
Club in the cool morning hours walking the front nine of the
course.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart had missed the cut at the National Car Rental Classic
near his home in Orlando, Fla. Hicks flew home to be with his
family for a couple of days before coming to Houston. On Monday
morning, he decided to get a head start on learning the intracacies
of the Cypress Creek Course so he would be armed with accurate
yardages when Stewart arrived later Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In the span of one hole, the wonderful morning turned into
uncertainty. And then tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just doing what we normally do,'' Sullivan said. ``We
were walking the course, making sure we had good yardages and then
Mike's cell phone rings as we're coming off the ninth tee.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kind of falls behind while he's on the phone and then when
we get up the fairway, he catches up and says, `You're not going to
believe the phone call I just got.'
</P>
<P>
   ``A pro at the club he belongs too in Raleigh (N.C.) called him
and said the plane Payne was on was having trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike told me that Payne was on his way to Dallas to look at
some property that they were thinking about buying (for a possible
golf-course design). He kind of staggered off the ninth green.
</P>
<P>
   ``And from there, pain turned into horror. We knew it was bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Few people know pro golfers as well as their caddies. And the
fraternity of caddies is a close-knit one. Players and caddies form
bonds that last a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks wasted no time departing Houston. But Sullivan and others
were stunned about the news of Stewart's death when the plane in
which he was a passenger veered off-course and crashed in rural
South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not only a shroud over this tournament, but the rest
of this year,'' said Sullivan, who has been Maggert's caddie for
many years and is one of the most respected bag-haulers on Tour.
``And what about next year's U.S. Open. That's going to be a very
hollow event.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said the memories of Stewart will be what everybody in
the pro golf industry will try to concentrate on.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wore the funny clothes,'' Sullivan said. ``We called it a
clown outfit. But Payne had the personality that he could take it
when you said that about him. And he'd dish it right back to you.
He was fun to be around because he was a fun person.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he was a champion's champion.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Champions Golf Club founder Jack Burke Jr.: ``His daddy
always told him that it was OK to be different. He encouraged him
to be different.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart certainly was.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's two lasting, defining moments will be the images of
him pumping his fists and hugging Hicks as the two celebrated his
15-foot tournament-winning putt at the U.S. Open in June and his
role in the incredible Ryder Cup comeback for the U.S. team against
the Europeans last month.
</P>
<P>
   After that comeback, the Americans celebrated unabashedly and
made no apologies for their partying. Europeans took offense, which
seems a little insignificant now.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last month, there's been a lot of criticism about the
Ryder Cup celebration, and some of that has been aimed at Payne,''
said Tour player David Ogrin. ``Doesn't that all seem petty right
now.''

LABOR SECRETARY TOUTS WTO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL NYHAN and ARTHUR C. GORLICK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Clinton administration Monday opened the defense
of its vision for labor in the global economy _ calling for greater
worker protections in the midst of free trade _ by coping with
angry protesters seeking a greater voice and displaced Boeing Co.
workers.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton dispatched Labor Secretary Alexis Herman
to Seattle Monday to pave the way for his arrival at next month's
World Trade Organization meeting. Herman pledged to push for a
working group within the trade body that would address a litany of
labor concerns, including child labor and forced labor.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the administration hopes to make labor issues a
higher priority during the trade body's deliberations, Herman said.
</P>
<P>
   The WTO ``offers a chance to make a difference ... (and) put
labor at the center of trade problems,'' Herman said at a meeting
in Benaroya Hall on the impact of globalization on the world's
workers.
</P>
<P>
   In her one-day sweep of Seattle, Herman also took a closer look
at the global economy's impact on the Puget Sound region. She
visited a training center that is teeming with former Boeing
workers striving to adapt their skills for jobs outside the
aerospace giant.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton's administration's attempt to balance the needs of
workers with the demands of free trade hasn't pleased everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Activists greeted Herman with allegations that the president is
ignoring their concerns. For example, they claim multinational
firms dominate the WTO's agenda to the detriment of working people.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fraud,'' yelled David Rice, a Seattle resident who
is protesting the policies of the World Trade Organization, as
Herman discussed trade and labor matters.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters held up a variety of handmade signs stating such
things as ``All talk, no change'' and other slogans.
</P>
<P>
   The protests are only a preview of the marches, demonstrations
and other events that are expected to greet delegates from 135
countries when they descend on Seattle for the start of a new round
of trade policy talks, Nov. 30-Dec. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Herman defended the adminstation's record on labor
issues, saying it continues to make progress in stregthening global
labor rights. She repeatedly cited a recent international child
labor convention, designed to crack down on the use of child labor.
</P>
<P>
   But with the workforce and the workplace changing everyday, she
added that such accords are only the beginning, in an address
earlier in the day at downtown Seattle's Washington Athletic Club.
</P>
<P>
   She said other international bodies, such as the World Bank and
the International Monetary Fund could also play a greater role in
protecting workers from abuse.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming months, Herman may get a chance to address the
Puget Sound's struggles to adjust to the emerging global economy.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle-based Boeing is a key player in many debates about
global trade as the nation's leading exporter. Growing competition
from rival Airbus Industrie has spurred the manufacturer to
streamline its operations and layoff thousands of workers.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Herman visited a worker retraining center _ run jointly
by the International Association of Machinists and Boeing _
designed to help those workers land new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   As she toured the center, she talked with former Boeing
Machinists now seeking training and jobs in a wide range of fields,
from fiberoptics to airline mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   The center, however, can't keep up with the number of Boeing
employees flowing out of the region's plants. Currently, 500 people
are on the waiting list to tap the center's resources.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials say that number is expected to grow in the
coming months as Boeing continues to seek greater efficiencies on
its assembly lines and copes with a downturn in airplane orders
</P>
<P>
   So, the center expects to seek additional federal funding _ on
top of the $20.4 million it received earlier this year _ in the
next month to help deal with the demand.
</P>
<P>
   Herman didn't publicly address the issue, and the IAM said
nothing has been decided, but she said today's workers generally
need ``skills to find new jobs.''

AT&AMP;T PROFITS EASE, BUT STILL BEAT FORECASTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ AT&AMP;T, the nation's most widely held stock, posted
quarterly results Monday that exceeded analysts' expectations and
underscored the increasing importance in the communications
industry of new services at the expense of traditional products.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's earnings beat estimates by a penny a share, but the
company's overall profit declined largely because of a dilution of
its stock caused by the acquisition of Tele-Communications Inc.,
the cable TV giant.
</P>
<P>
   Strong growth in the AT&AMP;T units that provide wireless phone
service and that serve the complex communication needs of big
businesses was largely offset by continued declines in the
company's core consumer long-distance business.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, AT&AMP;T demonstrated healthy revenue growth, especially
compared with anemic revenue performance in recent years. But it
was not able to maintain the pace of revenue growth it established
in the second quarter, and the company still appears to be growing
less quickly than the rest of the telecommunications industry,
which is surging amid deregulation and the rise of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A big problem AT&AMP;T has in keeping pace with the rest of the
industry is that its finances are still largely tied to standard
long-distance phone service, a market in which it remains No. 1.
But AT&AMP;T's share of the long-distance market has steadily fallen
for at least 15 years, and the financial erosion caused by that
process recently accelerated as a price war broke out among the
leading long-distance carriers. That squeezed long-distance profit
margins thinner than a strand of optical fiber.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of sheer growth, the hot areas for AT&AMP;T are its
wireless unit and its outsourcing business, known as AT&AMP;T
Solutions, which seeks to serve large businesses. The company has
made progress in earnings growth by cutting billions in costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's results are all about delivering on our commitments to
investors by growing top-line revenues, meeting earnings targets
and reducing our costs,'' C. Michael Armstrong, AT&AMP;T's chairman,
said in a statement. ``Our strong third-quarter performance also
reflects the benefits of our investments in growth areas such as
wireless and outsourcing services, where revenues were up by more
than 40 percent each.''
</P>
<P>
   Counting the effect of AT&AMP;T's acquisition of IBM's network unit,
the AT&AMP;T Solutions business more than tripled its revenue, to $983
million in the quarter, up from $285 million in the period a year
earlier. The wireless unit reported revenue growth of 44.2 percent,
to about $2.1 billion. Excluding the effect of the acquisition of
Vanguard Cellular and the sale of AT&AMP;T's paging unit, revenue in
the group grew 40.9 percent compared with a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But all was not well in the wireless unit. The company added
269,000 customers in the quarter, down 17.4 percent from the
comparable period last year. AT&AMP;T said it had reined in its
wireless marketing efforts because of ``network capacity challenges
in some markets and a supply shortage of digital multi-network
phones.'' It did not identify the shortage with any particular
equipment vendor.
</P>
<P>
   Only last year, AT&AMP;T's business services unit, which is separate
from the AT&AMP;T Solutions operation, surpassed the consumer
long-distance business in revenue. Now, the business unit is almost
12 percent bigger, having increased its revenue in the quarter to
$6.3 billion, 5 percent higher than in the comparable period a year
earlier. At the same time, the consumer unit shrank 4.7 percent, to
about $5.6 billion in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding the effect of acquiring Tele-Communications Inc. and
of the IBM network unit, AT&AMP;T's revenue for the quarter grew 5.3
percent compared with the period a year earlier. Accounting as if
TCI and the IBM unit had already been a part of AT&AMP;T lifts the
company's revenue growth for the quarter 5.6 percent, to $16.3
billion from $15.44 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That is an improvement for AT&AMP;T over years past, but it is less
impressive than the 6.7 percent growth in the second quarter, to
$15.8 billion from $14.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the TCI and IBM unit acquisitions help increase
revenue growth, the TCI deal especially has been a killer for
AT&AMP;T's earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding the two deals, operating earnings were 81 cents a
diluted share, compared with 68 cents a share in the period a year
earlier. But including the effect of the two deals, operating
earnings were $1.75 billion, or 54 cents a share, down from $1.84
billion, or 68 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected
the company to earn 53 cents a share, according to First
Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks company earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of AT&AMP;T rose $1.6875, to $44.6875, on the New York Stock
Exchange Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Including all special charges and the effect of all its deals,
AT&AMP;T officially reported earnings of $1.6 billion, or 50 cents a
share, down from $2 billion, or 78 cents a share, in the period a
year earlier. Demonstrating the effect of the deals, revenue for
the quarter was $16.3 billion, up from $13.7 billion.

JEWELRY BY TWO SISTERS IN STEP WITH THE TIMES  
 SHATOOSH AND ALLIGATOR: ONE OF THEM HAS A STIGMA ATTACHED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Fla., La.)  (mk) 
 By GINIA BELLAFANTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Costly earrings, necklaces and bracelets _ the kind
one guesses supermodels wear with a bit more enthusiasm than the
sort they have promoted for lower-tier jewelers _ have become the
fastest-growing segment of the jewelry market. That must come as
little surprise in an era when millionaires are as commonplace as
expensive apartments. Still, it bodes well for two
jewelry-designing sisters who are about to open shop on the Upper
East Side (they already have a high-profile clientele from a first
store in Los Angeles and from a Manhattan showroom).
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 1, the Slane sisters, Landon, 33, and Heath, 34, who
grew up in North Carolina, will open Slane &AMP; Slane in a 1910 town
house at 30 E. 74th St.
</P>
<P>
   The Slanes, whose work is also sold at Ian Schrager's latest
hotel, the St. Martin's Lane in London, specialize in elegantly
modern _ which is to say, un-hippie-ish _ sterling silver pieces
priced from $125 to $1,200. They also design architectural pieces
in 18-karat gold, many with exotic stones, priced from $300 to
$40,000.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters took up jewelry design just a few years ago after
vigorous bouts of career experimentation. Landon Slane dabbled in
television production, social work and retailing in three different
cities before settling in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Heath Slane, who runs the Los Angeles store on North Robertson
Boulevard, designed menswear for Ralph Lauren, tried landscape
photography and served a stint in the art department at Details
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a real love of stones,'' Heath Slane said. The
sisters' clients include Gwyneth Paltrow, Sharon Stone, Serena
Altschul of MTV and the makeup artist Kevyn Aucoin, who bought many
of his Christmas gifts from the Slanes last year. They also make
cuff links for men and count Peter Duchin and Dominick Dunne among
their clients.
</P>
<P>
   With Stigma (and Without)
</P>
<P>
   Jewelry is mostly controversy-free. Shatoosh, another
high-priced indulgence, is not. The fiber derived from the wool of
the threatened Tibetan antelope, or chiru, is the basis for coveted
shawls costing upward of $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   But trade in shatoosh has been illegal since 1979 under the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild
Fauna and Flora, although that fact has not been widely known until
recently.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, a number of shatoosh-owning socialites, including
Nan Kempner and Beth Rudin de Woody, were subpoenaed by the U.S.
District Court in Newark, N.J., to testify before a grand jury
about how they had come to possess their wraps.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, building on the publicity that probe has received,
the World Wildlife Fund initiated a ``Don't Buy Shatoosh''
campaign. As part of the effort, the model Shalom Harlow plans to
write to fashion editors, encouraging them to alert readers to the
dangers to chirus, which are slaughtered by poachers for their
wool, and whose population has been reduced to fewer than 75,000,
George Schaller, a Tibetan wildlife expert, has estimated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want a stigma attached to this product,'' said Ginette
Hemley, the vice president for species conservation at the World
Wildlife Fund. ``There's no problem with habitat. The biggest
threat to this animal is poaching because of this product.''
</P>
<P>
   An animal about which there is a reverse confusion these days is
the alligator. Last week at a fabric trade show at the Javits
Convention Center in New York, J. Don Ashley, an alligator-farming
consultant from Tallahassee, Fla., set up a booth with the menacing
14-foot skin of an American alligator, in an attempt to resurrect
domestic fashion interest in the reptile. It was removed from the
endangered species list by the federal government a decade ago. (It
is still listed as threatened under the wildlife protection treaty,
but skins can be traded as long as they are tagged and numbered,
meant to prevent poaching.)
</P>
<P>
   Today more than 50 percent of American alligator skins, most of
which are harvested from breeding farms or on private property in
Louisiana and Florida, are now exported to France. (John Galliano
showed a full-length alligator dress for fall.) But Americans are
apparently still squeamish about the skin. Ashley said that at
least 10 retailers and product developers who wandered by his booth
wondered, ``Is this really all legal?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer is yes. The alligator population is thriving, said
Ms. Hemley of the World Wildlife Fund, because of sound
conservation and harvesting. ``The alligator is one of our success
stories,'' she said.

IN MICHIGAN, SCHOOL CHOICE WEEDS OUT COSTLIER STUDNETS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By TAMAR LEWIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A University of Michigan study of the state's school-choice
programs found that the spread of charter schools and interdistrict
transfers has created new educational opportunities for many of the
neediest families and serious problems for only a few of the
state's school districts. But it said most of the programs are
designed to attract only the students who cost the least to
educate.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last five years, as school choice programs have grown,
many experts worried that charters, publicly funded schools that
are not required to follow teacher union or local school board
rules; vouchers, public money that can be taken to any private
school, and programs that allow students to transfer to neighboring
school districts, would attract the brightest students and those
with the most involved parents. The result would be that the
neighborhood schools would be left with the least motivated, most
difficult students.
</P>
<P>
   That has not been the case in Michigan, the study found. But
many of the choice programs are taking the students who comprise
the cream of the crop financially.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't find the academic creaming so many people worried
about early on,'' said David Arsen, one of the three University of
Michigan professors who wrote the report. ``What we found instead
is creaming on the basis of cost. Charter schools generally are
taking the students who are cheapest to educate, and leaving behind
those who are more expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, the state pays schools the same amount, almost
$6,000, for each student enrolled. But because younger students are
cheaper to educate than teen-agers who need laboratories, athletic
equipment, extensive libraries and specialized teachers, most of
those who have opened charter schools have chosen to open
elementary schools.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that three-quarters of the charter schools
offer no special education services, and even the few that do
enroll special needs students provide them with fewer and less
costly services than do nearby public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The report points out that when charters enroll low-cost
students and exclude high-cost students, they increase the average
costs for public school districts that must still provide the more
expensive services.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 3 percent of Michigan's students used school-choice
programs, with 34,000 attending one of the state's 138 charter
schools, and another 15,000 attending a school outside their home
district. This year, some 50,000 children may be in charter
schools, giving Michigan the third-largest charter population,
after Arizona and California.
</P>
<P>
   About half the school districts in Michigan now accept
out-of-district student transfers, but many of the most affluent,
fastest-growing districts do not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone past the time when we can put the genie back in the
bottle,'' said Gary Sykes, another of the study's authors. ``This
is here to stay. It's time to shift the attention from the debate
about whether choice is good or bad to figuring out what mechanisms
work.''
</P>
<P>
   The laws governing school choice vary enormously from state to
state. ``Our basic finding is that the rules matter,'' said David
Plank, the third author. ``Different rules create different
incentives and different outcomes.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, in Michigan, where charters must make their
admissions choices by lottery, most charters are in urban districts
and enroll more poor and minority students than neighboring
districts.
</P>
<P>
   But in California, where charters are allowed to select their
students and require parents to contribute resources, most charters
are in suburbs or small towns, and enroll fewer poor and minority
students than neighboring school districts.  &QL;

90 GROUPS IN NEW YORK STATE APPLY TO OPERATE CHARTER SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ninety groups have applied to open charter schools in New York
state next year, including 35 whose schools would be run by
profit-making companies, state officials announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The latest batch of applications include 27 from New York City,
mostly in Brooklyn and the Bronx. But applications also poured in
from groups throughout the state, including 9 in Buffalo, 11 in
Rochester and 14 on Long Island. The number of applications has
soared since last winter, when only 15 groups applied for the first
round of charters.
</P>
<P>
   The State University of New York can grant 50 charters under a
state law passed last December, and the State Board of Regents can
issue 50 more. The first eight applications were approved in June,
and three of those schools opened in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``This proves that there is broad interest from people all
across the state who want to provide a new kind of choice in public
schools,'' said Robert J. Bellafiore, executive director of the
Charter Schools Institute, an arm of the SUNY board of trustees.
Under the state's charter school law, the trustees decide which
applications to approve.
</P>
<P>
   The applications will go through a complex review process, and
the SUNY trustees will make a final decision in January. Although
the state has room for 92 additional schools, not all of those
charters will be granted for next fall, Bellafiore said.
</P>
<P>
   Bellafiore said he was not surprised by the large number of
profit-making companies, like Victory Schools and Edison Schools,
that want to run charter schools, which are publicly financed but
independent from their school districts. In New York, such
companies have to join with nonprofit organizations if they want to
open charter schools. But the companies can run the day-to-day
operations of the schools.
</P>
<P>
   The companies typically provide enough money to get a school
running, and in return, they keep a percentage of the annual state
aid that the school receives.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the companies interested in running the next round of
charter schools are already running schools in other states,
Bellafiore said. Victory Schools is running New York City's first
charter school, the Sisulu Children's Academy in Harlem, and hopes
to open five more next fall.
</P>
<P>
   Bellafiore said it was too early to know how successful Sisulu
and another for-profit school, the New Covenant Charter School in
Albany, would be at making money. ``Frankly, most of the companies
view this as a long-term investment,'' he said. ``But I've visited
both of these schools several times, and they have demonstrated
what we believe to be structured, effective learning
environments.''

GOT A GOOD HECKLE? SUBMIT IT TO A COLLECTOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1996, Michael Tolley of Toronto was hit with a dose of harsh
reality while he and four of his friends took in a game between the
Toronto Blue Jays and the Minnesota Twins.
</P>
<P>
   Tolley recalled that he and his buddies were sitting in the
stands at the SkyDome, giving the Twins the business. Suddenly,
from the bullpen, Twins catcher Matt Walbeck yelled back at Tolley
and his pals, informing them that they were ``the worst hecklers he
had heard in his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some may say being a bad heckler is a good thing, but we knew
what he meant,'' Tolley said.
</P>
<P>
   The stinging criticism prompted Tolley to search hard for a way
to correct his problem. ``I began a quest to be a better heckler,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He tried books to no avail. He turned to the Internet but only
found lots of uninspired fan sites.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the 31-year-old Canadian took matters into his own
hands and launched a Web site to ``attract the good, funny and
small hecklers that are out there.'' Tolley's effort is called The
Baseball Heckle Depot (www.heckledepot.com) and it's a heckler's
dream.
</P>
<P>
   It might not be the most dynamic-looking site, but it makes for
some good reading during the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Since the site's launch in May, Tolley said he has received
hundreds of one-line heckles and ballpark heckling stories. He
categorizes the material and edits it, making sure the posts are
not vulgar, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Heckles are broken into selections for batters, fielders,
pitchers, the bullpen and the umpires. Chants, an interactive
survey and a code of ethics for heckling are also included.
</P>
<P>
   Tolley ranks which major-league teams have the best hecklers
(the New York Yankees, of course, are No. 1) and also ranks the
best players to heckle (the Baltimore Orioles' enigmatic Albert
Belle, of course).
</P>
<P>
   Tolley said he has found that baseball is unique when it comes
to how much fans are involved in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't heckle a hockey game; the players move around too
fast. You can't heckle at a football game; they'd never hear you,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But baseball is different. Heckling is as much of the game as
$5 hot dogs, beach balls in the bleachers and air-horns coming from
who-knows-where.''
</P>
<P>
   HEY, BATTA, BATTA: A few of the best heckles posted at Michael
Tolley's Baseball Heckle Depot (www.heckledepot.com):
</P>
<P>
   For batters: ``You couldn't drive home Miss Daisy!''
</P>
<P>
   For umpires: ``Punch a hole in that mask; you're missing a good
game.''
</P>
<P>
   For the bullpen: ``Does that chewing tobacco have steroids in
it?''
</P>
<P>
   For pitchers: ``Someone go out there and put another quarter in
the pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   For fielders: ``Your idea of a double-play is a bourbon with a
beer chaser!''
</P>
<P>
   For Cal Ripken Jr.: ``Hey, what are you _ too good to take a day
off?''

EXCITE (AT) HOME TO ACQUIRE BLUEMOUNTAIN WEB SITE FOR UP TO $1
BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Please note that the word AT within parentheses has been
used in the third item instead of the symbol, which is
non-transmittable to many newspaper systems.)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Excite (at) home will pay up to $1 billion to acquire
Bluemountain.com, a privately held electronic greeting card company
with little revenue but millions of loyal users.
</P>
<P>
   Although a top-rated site on the Web, Bluemountain.com does not
actually sell anything. It was created in 1994 by two former
hippies, Stephen Schutz and Susan Polis Schutz, to be a ``spiritual
and emotional center for the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple, owners of the Blue Mountain Arts Publishing Co., a
successful paper greeting card and poetry publisher, decided to
give away E-greeting cards for free. Using only word-of-mouth as
advertising, Bluemountain.com swiftly grew to be one of the most
consistently popular sites on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   That popularity is what attracted Excite (at) home, which is
majority-owned by the AT&AMP;T Corp., serves as a gateway or portal, to
the Internet. Excite (at) home predicted that the acquisition would
increase its audience by 40 percent, to encompass approximately 34
percent of Internet traffic. With a 34 percent share, it would pass
the Disney portal Go.com for fifth position, right behind Lycos,
but still a long stretch from dominant players like America Online,
Microsoft and Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   In the short run, the combined audience will allow both sites to
raise their rates for advertisers. Additional revenue will also
come from opening up Bluemountain to commerce like flowers,
chocolates and gifts. Stock analysts generally praised the move,
and Excite (at) home's stock gained 75 cents to close at $39.8125
as the overall market and technology stocks generally fell.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the agreement, Excite (at) Home will issue
approximately 11 million new shares, valued at approximately $430
million, and $350 million in cash. If Bluemountain.com meets
certain targets for holiday traffic, it will get as much as $270
million more in the acquirer's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Excite (at) home's long-term strategy is to be a leading planner
in broad-band _ high-speed Internet access over cable television.
(at) home, which focuses on the cable business, acquired Excite to
create a narrow-band Internet presence and said that it had similar
intentions with Bluemountain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize the importance of making the narrow-band end of
the funnel as robust as possible explicitly for the purpose of
converting those users to broadband eventually.'' said George Bell,
Excite (at) home's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Devotees of the Bluemountain site use its cards for everything
from celebrating Robert Burns Day to proposing marriage to far-away
lovers. According to MediaMetrix, an Internet audience measurement
firm, it now ranks 14th among sites on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Although they have been approached for more than a year by
numerous companies, the Schutzes said they had declined to sell
because they wanted to keep creative control. But costs forced
their hand. ``As we got more and more popular, it got
extraordinarily expensive,'' said Ms. Polis Schutz. ``We had 300
servers and 86 employees. We could not handle it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Excite (at) home, which started the bidding process more than a
year and a half ago, made its third offer a few months ago, just as
the Schutzes were concluding they had to sell. The family was
impressed that Excite offered many of the features they wanted to
incorporate _like a calendar, date book and gift registry _ and
would have paid to develop themselves. They also clicked with Bell,
whose colorful past includes a long stint as an independent
documentary producer for organizations like National Geographic and
the Discovery Channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Excite (at) home team are understanding about the nature
of our community, and we are confident they will continue to be
good stewards into the future,'' said Jared Schutz, who is Stephen
and Susan's oldest son and executive director of Bluemountain.
Stephen will continue as editor in chief of Bluemountain for at
least another year, under the terms of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   While making a commitment to Bluemountain's community, Excite
(at) home savors the site's untapped commercial potential. ``The
beauty is you have roughly a million people ordering cards
everyday, and most all are for events that have gifts,'' said
Arthur Newman, an Internet analyst at Schroders.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo ran into trouble when it tried to bring a more commercial
approach to Geocities, a similar acquisition in 1998. A site where
users could make their own Web pages for free, Geocities had lots
of loyal customers who revolted when Yahoo tried to force members
to relinquish copyright on their Web creations.
</P>
<P>
   Bluemountain was spun off from the publishing company earlier
this year. Both companies are privately held by the Schutz family,
but Ms. Polis Schutz said the benefits of the merger would be
widely felt. ``Every musician, every artist, every employee has
options,'' she said. ``We are thrilled for them, that they are
going to be rewarded for their incredible dedication.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   FALLS CHURCH, Va. _ Pat Buchanan put aside a lifetime of
Republican fervor Monday and shifted his lagging presidential quest
to a run for the Reform Party nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our vaunted two-party system is a snare and a delusion and a
fraud upon the nation,'' Buchanan told a crowd of cheering
supporters as he bolted the GOP, showing his fiery instinct for
insurgency. ``Our two parties have become nothing but two wings on
the same bird of prey.''
</P>
<P>
   As visceral on the stump as ever, Buchanan, his campaign for the
Republican nomination frozen in the single-digit doldrums,
lambasted the two major parties as havens for big-money donors and
``hollow'' candidates who have ``rigged the game'' against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We choose not to play our assigned walk-on role in their sham
election,'' Buchanan declared to the delight of an exuberantly
partisan crowd that included Reform Party officials and loyalists
from his three failed bids for the Republican presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only the Reform Party offers the hope of a real debate and a
real choice of destinies,'' he insisted in resorting to the
alternative ticket created by Ross Perot as a lever of populist
power in the 1992 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   In a bizarre contest for the 2000 nomination taking shape
between Reform Party factions, Donald Trump, the real estate
millionaire, is quitting the Republican Party and threatening to
challenge Buchanan, denouncing him as a ``Hitler lover.'' Minnesota
Gov. Jesse Ventura, the party's major elected figure, is looking
with open disfavor on Buchanan's party-switching gambit. And while
Perot is proclaiming neutrality in any rivalry, even the
Buchananites agree Perot remains a quixotic figure.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Buchanan confirmed his third-party course, he was
attacked by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican
front-runner who is considered the candidate most likely to lose
votes in November should Buchanan attract serious numbers of
conservative voters. Insisting that Buchanan left the GOP for no
reason other than a failed candidacy, Bush scored Buchanan's
isolationist views, in particular his controversial thesis that
Hitler initially had presented no serious threat to the United
States in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat sees an America that should have stayed home while Hitler
overran Europe and perpetrated the Holocaust,'' Bush contended in a
statement expressing confidence that most conservative Republicans
would not follow Buchanan. In the weeks leading up to Buchanan's
announcement, Bush had refrained from harsh criticism of him in the
hope of keeping him in the party.
</P>
<P>
   But Buchanan hardly apologized for his views as he rued the
decline of ``all the great empires of Europe'' and the rise of ``a
superstate in Europe that pays homage to the great god, Mammon''
and, he said, ties up American soldiers in a ``Godless new world
order.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They call us isolationists, and that's one of the nicest
things they call us,'' he declared, drawing laughter from the crowd
at the Doubletree Hotel here in the western Washington suburbs,
miles from what Buchanan termed ``the Beltway elites.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, if they mean I intend to isolate America from all the
bloody, territorial, tribal and ethnic wars of the 21st century, I
plead guilty!'' he boomed, drawing the crowd to its feet in a wave
of applause and cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Once more offering himself as the unabashed candidate of
America-first policies, Buchanan vowed to ``rescue our lady,
America'' from what he termed ``the cultural and moral pit into
which she has fallen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a timeout on legal immigration to ease the downward
pressure on workers' wages,'' he maintained, ``and to defeat the
forces of separatism that threaten us and nations all over the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   With fresh campaign logos and a new red, white and blue Internet
site (www.buchananreform.com), the 60-year-old politician sought to
retool his candidacy with a speech laced with the sorts of red-meat
applause lines that first brought him success as a speechwriter for
President Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd roared as he denounced President Clinton as ``our own
Elmer Gantry, whose desecration of the temples of our civilization
and personal misconduct disqualify him'' as the nation's leader.
</P>
<P>
   The Buchananites roared again as he declared, ``The appeasement
of Beijing is a bipartisan disgrace!''
</P>
<P>
   And they stood and cheered as he bitterly denounced the Supreme
Court and vowed to ``herd the justices back into the narrow
stalls'' of constitutionalism. ``What is a self-governing people
doing meekly waiting each week for nine jurists to tell us how we
may live and how we should govern ourselves?'' he demanded, playing
to the Reformists' libertarian instincts even as he denounced the
legalization of abortion in ``that abomination they call Roe vs.
Wade.''
</P>
<P>
   Wielding a pallette filled with shades of national sovereignty,
Buchanan attacked employment quotas as un-American, declaring:
``The backsliding toward hyphenated Americanism must end.'' In
short order, he attacked the United Nations, global economic
treaties and ``IMF bailouts of deadbeat dictators.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In abandoning a Republican primary contest dominated solidly so
far by Bush, Buchanan set a course in which he must now fight state
by state within the evolving Reform Party factionalism to win
enough support for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get on 30 ballots,'' said Bay Buchanan,
Buchanan's sister and chief strategist. She noted that the campaign
already had hired Matt Sawyer, an election-law specialist who
helped Perot navigate the dense thicket of widely varying state
election laws in creating the party.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the 30 states that Ms. Buchanan is targeting, the Reform
Party is already established in 20 states where the Buchanan camp
is counting on help from such Reform Party veterans as Pat Choate,
Perot's confidante and former vice presidential running mate. He
has been openly piloting Buchanan`s veer toward the Reform ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party rules require a prospective nominee to try to
qualify for the ballot in the 29 states, plus the District of
Columbia, where the party does not have an automatic slot. The
nominee will be selected at a party convention in July.
</P>
<P>
   Choate conceded that Buchanan might have a problem in the
opposition to his candidacy expressed by Ventura, who is
encouraging talk of a Trump candidacy. ``It's not helpful, but it
will not keep him from getting the nomination,'' Choate said of
Buchanan's chances, estimating that the enthusiastic crowd of more
than 300 people here included a majority of the party's current
state chairmen.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have charged that money, not principle, prompted the
party switch by Buchanan. The Reform Party nominee will be entitled
to $12.6 million in federal campaign funds. But Bay Buchanan denied
that this was at the root of the Reform venture, while Buchanan
insisted that disgust drove him from the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Party has been good to me,'' he told the crowd.
``And I have tried to be loyal to it. But as John F. Kennedy said,
`Sometimes party loyalty asks too much.' And today, it asks too
much of us.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Expressing anguish at quitting his lifelong party, Buchanan
nonetheless beamed in summoning his followers to a new course,
using his old imagery of an assault on the castle of the
establishment. ``You don't know this peasant army,'' he said,
grinning. ``We have not yet begun to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, ever a history buff, noted that this was St. Crispin's
Day _ a reference to King Henry V's defeat of the superior forces
of France in the battle of Agincourt on this day in 1415. ``Let's
make a little history,'' he said, looking eager as he took up a
different battle flag.

RECRUIT STILL SOLD ON USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Whether or not sophomore quarterback Carson Palmer
returns this season from his broken collarbone is probably the most
intriguing question left for USC.
</P>
<P>
   But what effect will Palmer's decision have on Chatsworth High
quarterback Matt Cassel, who orally committed to USC last spring?
</P>
<P>
   Cassel committed with the idea he would redshirt his freshman
year and at worst be the backup during Palmer's senior year. In a
best-case scenario, Palmer would leave USC after his junior season,
allowing Cassel to start as a redshirt freshman.
</P>
<P>
   But the injury has made things uncertain _ at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   Cassel, however, has not wavered in his commitment to the
Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   ``My decision is final,'' Cassel said. ``It's kind of weird.
Maybe if he redshirts, maybe it changes the situation. Maybe it
kicks me back another year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not looking for him to leave early. It would be nice if he
left, but if he doesn't leave early, it's OK with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Cassel said even if Palmer decided to stay through his senior
season, he would be happy with his decision to attend USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping if it all works out, Carson leaves early,'' Cassel
said. ``If not, I'll come in as a redshirt sophomore.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Recruit watch: Among those attending Saturday's game were
linebacker Amon Gordon and quarterback/tight end Teyo Johnson of
Mira Mesa High in San Diego, along with Harvard-Westlake tight end
Alex Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   __ For the record: With Saturday's loss to Stanford, quarterback
Mike Van Raaphorst is 7-7 as a starter. Palmer is 5-3 and John Fox
is 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   __ Home and away: USC is two different teams under coach Paul
Hackett. At the Coliseum, the Trojans are 8-2, but on the road the
Trojans are only 3-7.
</P>
<P>
   __ Arizona State game time: USC's game on Nov. 6 with Arizona
State at the Coliseum will either be at 12:30 p.m. or 3:30 p.m.,
but a decision will not be made until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The game will be televised by ABC (Channel 7) at 12:30 p.m., or
Fox Sports West at 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   __ Lucky charms?: USC coach Paul Hackett is open to suggestions
for what it will take to break the Trojans' three-game losing
streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for any good-luck charms, any rabbit's feet,
whatever it's going to take to have us relax and play the full 60
minutes we're capable of,'' Hackett said. ``Any possible way to get
ourselves out of this week.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Questions, please: Unlike last week, Hackett patiently
answered questions during Monday's booster luncheon that is open to
the public.
</P>
<P>
   __ First-half team: USC is outscoring opponents 146-51,
including 77-27 in the second quarter. But in the fourth quarter
and overtime, the Trojans have been outscored 78-41.
</P>
<P>
   __ Scouting Cal: Although California's offense has struggled
this season, the Bears' running game will be a focus for USC this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman tailback Joe Igber, who is only 5-foot-8, has had three
consecutive 100-yard games, including a freshman-record 182 yards
last weekend against Washington.

<P>
   If you opened the August issue of Flaunt magazine smack in the
middle expecting to see a picture of, say, Elizabeth Hurley
languishing at the beach, the fringes of her Gucci halter dress
tickling the water's surface, you would have been disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   There, instead, were two full-page, borderless close-ups of
women's faces, their skin splotchy, their expressions drained of
any life-affirming look of curiosity. Displaying clothes is the
ostensible purpose of a fashion picture, but the garments worn by
the models _ a dress and coat by Valentino, as a credit line
revealed _ were barely visible. The models looked a week shy of 72.
</P>
<P>
   Flaunt, unleashed last fall in Los Angeles, is one of a breed of
small, independently owned, increasingly influential style
magazines that exist more as a venue for far-reaching experiments
in fashion photography than as showcases for clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years, more than half a dozen similar
publications _ V, Big, 2wice, Surface, aRude, Issue _ have emerged
in the United States, in the spirit of European fashion
publications like The Face, I.D. and the newer Dutch, which has
attracted an international cult following. Over the summer,
Matthias Vriens, then the editor in chief of Dutch, was hired by
the Armani company to be its creative director, signaling the
seriousness with which these little magazines are now taken.
</P>
<P>
   The publications, which claim readerships of 10,000 to 100,000,
compar a circulation of a million for Vogue, are not only
affecting the lives of a select group of talented young people, but
also reshaping the business of image-making itself. While working
for important American fashion magazines used to be considered an
essential step for a young photographer hoping to advance to
lucrative advertising work, the presence of these publications is
making that step unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are taking more chances with people who haven't been
tested at the big magazines,'' said Andrew Thomas of Art +
Commerce, a photography agency representing renowned photographers
like Annie Leibovitz and Steven Meisel, as well as newcomers like
Luis Sanchis, who catapulted from shooting for niche European
magazines to photographing campaigns for Gucci and Neiman Marcus.
</P>
<P>
   Warwick Saint, 28, a photographer who shot exclusively for
magazines like I.D., Dutch and Flaunt, where he became known for
technically striking portraits, got to shoot advertising campaigns
for Costume National, Diesel and Levi's on the basis of that work.
</P>
<P>
   Julian Meijer, head of a photo agency that manages rising stars
like Taryn Simon (who has shot Levi's ads and promotional material
for the band Nine Inch Nails) said, ``The whole status of working
for Harper's Bazaar and Vogue _ everyone's over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sally Singer, Vogue's fashion news director, said she didn't
think so. ``If a young photographer gets a call from Vogue or
Bazaar, I think he's going to go,'' she said. ``What's great about
the small magazines is that they do allow young photographers to
experiment. But Vogue is about showing clothes to readers who
probably want to see the whole skirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Editors and art directors for the independent magazines say they
are motivated by disenchantment with the predictability of
mass-market fashion magazines _ increasingly devoted to the lives,
poodles and handbags of movie stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days, editors were really editing a magazine,''
said Long Nguyen, one of three founding editors of Flaunt. ``Today
they are like flight attendants serving ready-made food on a
tray.''
</P>
<P>
   Alix Browne, the editor of V and a former staff member at
Harper's Bazaar and Mirabella, said of the fashion pages in
mainstream women's magazines: ``Everyone is doing the same story.
You see the same Gucci story, the same Prada story, the same
celebrity on every cover.'' V is a provocative if not always
legible fashion magazine that began publishing in New York last
month.
</P>
<P>
   The new magazines both here and abroad are read by both women
and men (a Flaunt survey showed that almost 50 percent of its
readers are men), although, suffice it to say, by women and men who
could more easily pick Frank Gehry and Issey Miyake out of a
line-up than Regis and Kathie Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Editors of the independents readily admit that their magazines
make little or no money. ``It's been difficult,'' said Marcelo
Juunemann, the owner and editor of Big, a beautiful publication
that comes out six times a year. It reports a circulation of 32,000
and, like almost all of these magazines, remarkably enough is
replete with big advertisers, like Gucci, Calvin Klein and DKNY.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers typically pay about $7,000 a page in an independent
magazine _ about a sixth of the price of a page in Vogue. ``We're
not making a fortune,'' Juunemann said, ``but we pay the bills and
have money to buy the paper and keep going.'' Indeed, production
costs are exorbitant at these publications, where printing is
top-end and the paper sometimes thicker and glossier than what you
see in Vogue or Elle.
</P>
<P>
   One place the money doesn't go is into the pockets of the
photographers who are the magazines' creative mainstays. They are
generally paid nothing. Sometimes they are reimbursed for expenses.
This does not seem to bother them, given the prospect of lucrative
future commissions, not to mention that when they receive an
assignment from a Dutch or a Flaunt, it isn't really an assignment
in the traditional sense. They are generally free to point their
cameras in whatever direction they feel a tug.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's for the glory,'' said Alexi Hay, 25, a photographer who
is coming of age in this subculture. ``There's no one standing over
you telling you what clothes to use.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old formula of finding a location and getting beautiful
girls is obsolete.''
</P>
<P>
   In the current issue of Dutch, Hay mused on the subject of
street-tough posturing in an astonishing 23 pages. There were bits
of Versace this and Gaultier that on male ``models'' he cast at the
Puerto Rican Day parade in New York. His hair and makeup person was
a Lower East Side barber.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of such endeavors, Hay recently landed an ad
campaign for Armani's A/X line, thanks to Vriens' appointment at
Armani.
</P>
<P>
   While they are flight paths for young talent, the small
magazines now also attract celebrated photographers like David
LaChapelle and Mario Testino, drawn to the genre's use-your-wings
ethos.
</P>
<P>
   As LaChapelle's surreal colored, elaborately produced celebrity
portraitures in Vanity Fair and Rolling Stone would indicate, he is
not a man easily reined in. But despite the freedom he is afforded
by mainstream magazines, he appreciates the chance to work in what
he describes as a different mind-set, even at his own expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing to look at a blank page and think I can do
whatever I want,'' he said. ``There's creative anarchy going on.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   LaChapelle recently shot pictures for Flaunt, based very loosely
around some Helmut Lang clothes that depict fears of the
apocalypse. More arresting than any single pair of pants is the
image of a nearly naked, overweight man lying on a floral
comforter, his body covered in red blotches. The entire shoot was
inspired by a panic-inducing article on smallpox in The New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Helmut Lang would be horrified,'' LaChapelle said.
``He sent me a fax saying he really liked it.''
</P>
<P>
   To judge by the many ad pages in these new ventures, designers
(and liquor companies, the other ad constituency) are very
supportive them, despite the fact the editors seem a little
confused on the whole subject of consumerism.
</P>
<P>
   ``They represent a different approach to fashion editorial,''
said Trey Laird, executive vice president and corporate creative
director of Donna Karan International. ``They attract a reader who
is on the edge of fashion. It's a reader we want to reach.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to big fashion publications, he said: ``Magazines go
through different periods. There's been a safety and commercial
approach to the presentation of fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   None of this is to suggest that advertisers are diverting their
money away from the Vogues and Bazaars of the world. With a hunger
to keep their images cool, they simply want to be everywhere. The
major magazines will no doubt endure, since it is safe to assume
that more people will want to look at Winona Ryder in Chanel than
at pictures of diseased and unclothed middle-aged men.
</P>
<P>
   At their best, the images in alternative fashion magazines offer
color-saturated studies in loneliness, emotional dislocation and
suburban tedium, sometimes more conceptually evolved than anything
on the Independent Film Channel. At their worst, they present a
trite, dissipated sexuality that is meant to shock and doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a punk sensibility that's now old hat,'' said Simon
Doonan, the creative director of Barneys New York. Doonan said he
had lost faith in alternative magazines he used to turn to for
ideas. Pictorially, he said, ``it's still people lolling around
looking like they've been hit over the head with a frying pan.''
</P>
<P>
   For his latest ad campaign, he found inspiration in a poster
purchased at the Good Will.

EDITORIAL: MR. FALWELL'S PROGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Oct. 26:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When warring communities get together for the purpose of
increasing understanding and combating violence, it is a noteworthy
event. The gathering of the Rev. Jerry Falwell and his supporters
and 200 gay Christians in Falwell's Thomas Road Baptist Church in
Lynchburg, Va., last weekend was such an occasion _ and a telling
moment in Falwell's personal evolution and that of the gay rights
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Falwell, the political and theological conservative who founded
the Moral Majority, has long deployed harsh anti-gay rhetoric in
his fund-raising appeals. He told the meeting he would not change
his view that homosexuality is a sin, but he agreed to tone down
statements that, among other things, have provided a moral context
for those who commit violence against gay people.
</P>
<P>
   Falwell's willingness to dispense with anti-gay vitriol is a
measure of how far the gay rights movement has progressed toward
cultural acceptance, and recognition on Falwell's part that the
murder of Matthew Shepard, the gay college student who died after a
brutal assault a year ago in Wyoming, has made it less acceptable
to be seen as spewing hatred against gays. Falwell was persuaded to
hold the meeting by the Rev. Mel White, a minister who worked as a
ghostwriter on Falwell's autobiography in the 1980's, several years
before declaring his homosexuality. White apparently struck a chord
when he told Falwell in August that his organization's language
about homosexuals was so harsh it could inspire anti-gay violence.
</P>
<P>
   While Falwell has agreed to tone himself down, he remains
opposed to measures designed to end discrimination on the basis of
sexual orientation. His stance continues to send a damaging message
that gay people are second-class citizens and lesser human beings.
It also says that Falwell's break from bigotry is still incomplete.

EDITORIAL: TO THE REAR, MARCH! 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Oct. 26:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Early on, George W. Bush and some other prominent Republicans
went through the motions of trying to prevent Patrick Buchanan's
announcement that he was ``ending my lifelong membership in the
Republican Party.'' But in the end, no one seemed very upset by
Buchanan's exit or by Donald Trump's simultaneous defection to the
Reform Party. But while Trump's presidential dreaming had the feel
of a self-indulgent lark, Buchanan's seems a blend of financial
scheming, retro rage and perhaps a bit of self-delusion. Does
anyone believe that Buchanan's ``peasant army'' really exists? They
may be ready to storm the castle, but they certainly did not help
their man in the GOP polls.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's failure to make the grade against Bush and John
McCain will not matter, of course, if he can get hold of the
party's $12.6 million in federal funds. Then Buchanan, a wealthy
Washingtonian, will have all the money he needs to mount his
faux-populist crusade against the ``money boys and the Beltway
elites.''
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, he embarked on his departure with an allusion to the
St. Crispin's Day speech in Shakespeare's ``Henry V,'' a paean to
what true leadership meant in the Middle Ages. He then went on to
promise battle on a number of issues that most Americans have
already worked through. At a time when American culture and
economic values are on the march around the globe, Buchanan wants
to save America ``before she disappears into a godless New World
Order.'' His mission, he said, is to end the racial quotas that
have helped minorities enter the mainstream and to force a ``time
out'' in the immigration that perpetually revitalizes an
immigrants' nation. He promised to keep America from entering ``all
the bloody, territorial, tribal and ethnic wars'' of the 21st
century, thus crippling the halting but vital effort to find
international remedies to genocidal conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Such efforts to isolate America from the real issues of the 21st
century should help isolate Buchanan. Already his views on why the
United States should not have entered World War II against Hitler's
Germany have drawn understandable outrage, not only from veterans
but also historians. Trump, who sees himself as a possible antidote
to the Buchanan forces, calls Buchanan a ``Hitler lover.'' Buchanan
has rejected such a label, but his warlike oratory draws fringe
voters and surrounds his candidacy with the persistent whiff of
racism and anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan seems to believe that his divisive social views will
open up pockets of discontent in the middle class and that his
protectionist trade policy and promises of job protection can pull
in suburban and union workers normally loyal to the major parties.
First, of course, he must wrest the Reform Party from the likes of
Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota; Ross Perot, whose ambitions for
the party are still fairly cloudy, and perhaps even Trump.
Meanwhile, we have to wonder if the idealists who initially joined
the Reform Party think that roster adds up to a rational definition
of reform.

A DAY SO PERFECT TURNS INTO TRAGEDY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By FRAN BLINEBURY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Against the backdrop of a bright blue quiet sky, if
you squint through the sun, it is a perfect afternoon to stand at
the driving range and watch Jeff Maggert hit balls.
</P>
<P>
   Long and high and straight and true.
</P>
<P>
   It is warm and slightly breezy, the kind of ideal day made for
golf.
</P>
<P>
   And other things.
</P>
<P>
   What we always learn about tragedy is that we are never ready
for it to occur.
</P>
<P>
   It is an idyllic scene at Champions Golf Club, where the
fairways have been mowed so neatly, where the greens have been
rolled to look as hard and smooth as giant billiard tables, where
the flower beds are filled with all the colors of a painter's
palette, where even the pine trees seem primped to stand at
attention, where everything is precisely the way it should be.
</P>
<P>
   Except the flags are flying at half-mast.
</P>
<P>
   While Maggert beats golf balls and his roiling, churning
emotions with each controlled, even swing, inside the clubhouse a
large-screen TV is showing images of a pasture in South Dakota
where a private plane carrying Payne Stewart and four others has
crashed, killing all aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The reigning U.S. Open champion, No. 3 on the money list,
Stewart was scheduled to arrive in Houston for the Tour
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   But something went so horribly wrong inside the plane, producing
the bizarre story of the pilotless jet, bound from Orlando to
Dallas, streaking across airspace in the middle of the country
until running out of fuel and falling out of the sky.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
THERE ARE NO WORDS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here, on the golf course at Champions, two mockingbirds chase
after each other from railing to railing on a pair of spectator
platforms, a chubby little brown rabbit darts across a cart path
and through an open flap in one of the hospitality tents and a
couple of fathers hold their sons by the hand as they stroll and
enjoy the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Out in front of the clubhouse, where the VIP parking lot has
spaces reserved for each of the players with painted nameplates,
somebody has already tied a blue ribbon next to the sign that says
``Payne Stewart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a loss for his family, his wife and kids,'' said
Maggert. ``You feel so helpless because you can't change the
outcome. All I can say is I don't know what to say.''
</P>
<P>
   What can he say? The 8x11 sheet on the clubhouse table shows the
pairings for this morning's (now cancelled) pro-am: ``9:09 _ Payne
Stewart and Jeff Maggert.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not one big traveling fraternity on the PGA Tour with all
of the guys taking turns hanging out in each other's hotel rooms
from week to week. But relationships develop, friendships grow and
Stewart is one of those who has crept inside the gallery rope a lot
of the players put up around themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the general public may have known him mostly for the
distinctive wardrobe of Plus-Fours he wore on the golf course, an
homage to the game and a time gone by.
</P>
<P>
   But he was also the honorable sportsman who conceded a long putt
to halve the match with Colin Montgomerie at the end of the
contentious Ryder Cup last month. And the players knew him as
fun-loving, glib, quotable and as fiery a competitor as you'll
find.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MOMENTS OF JOY PASS QUICKLY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The image that was played over and over on Monday was from
Pinehurst, N.C., in June. It showed him sinking that 15-foot,
bending-to-the-right putt through the drizzle on the final hole
that gave him his second U.S. Open title, and it showed him
triumphantly pumping his right fist into the air twice, then
catching his jubilant caddie, Mike Hicks, who raced across the
green and leapt into Stewart's arms.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday morning, Hicks was at Champions, getting everything in
order for Stewart's arrival, when he received a phone call that
told him the unthinkable had happened.
</P>
<P>
   They are so bright, full of life and celebrity and money and
maybe that is why it's always so shocking. A handsome, wealthy son
of a former president climbs into a private plane with his
beautiful wife to fly to a wedding and they never arrive.
</P>
<P>
   The sports world has had its share: Roberto Clemente and Thurman
Munson from baseball, Knute Rockne from football and golfer
``Champagne'' Tony Lema just after winning the British Open in
1964. It is part of the privilege that comes with their riches _
and part of the danger.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing we learn about tragedy is that no one and no time
is ever immune.
</P>
<P>
   Over by the practice green, three women sip cold drinks as the
sun bakes their bare arms and nod their heads in approval as
somebody rattles a long putt into the cup.
</P>
<P>
   It is warm and slightly breezy, the kind of ideal day made for
golf.
</P>
<P>
   Against the backdrop of a bright blue quiet sky, a thousand
miles away, a TV image shows a chopper hovering over a burnt scar
in a pasture.
